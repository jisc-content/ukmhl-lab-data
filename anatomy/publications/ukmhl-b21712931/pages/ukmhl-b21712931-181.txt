159 MORBID ANATOMY. 973. A cranium, showing the effects of an old fracture. There is a deficiency of bone, in the right parietal, about 5^ in. long, an inch at the widest part, irregular in form, and horizontal in its direction ; anteriorly there extends from the opening to beyond the median line, something that looks like the cicatrix of a narrow fracture; the internal surface is much more irregular, and there is a peculiar ero- ded look to some distance beyond the external cicatrix. Posteriorly a cicatrized .line extends from the opening, downward into the occiput, and is much more marked in- ternally than upon the outer surface, with erosion and nmcli roughness. There is no deposit of new bone; the edges of the large opening having a smooth, cicatrized look, and the structure of the whole bone beincr quite healthy. & From a female, dissecting-room subject, about thirt}--five years of age. Corresponding to the large opening was a large and deep cicatrix externally; and anteriorly, there seemed to be a smaller one. There is a question whether this may not have been a case of burn, or of disease; but it, on the whole, appeared more like a fracture. 1859. Dr. Ii. M. Hodges. 97-1. Lower half of the skull, showing an irregularity of the under surface of the occiput, and an appearance as of a nearly closed fissure upon the median line, perhaps the re- sult of an old fracture ; occipital foramen considerably en- arged posteriorly. Upon the inner surface is some very earthy-looking deposit of new bone. From a middle-aged man, who had been regarded as a simpleton. 1856. Mr. Jas. Coldham, vied, student. 9/5. Old and strongly united fracture of the body of the lower jaw with considerable absorption of bone between the angle and the seat of fracture. Some appearance, also, of a second fracture near the articular process. From an old person. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. Removal or depression of the upper maxillary bone, nasal polypi. See

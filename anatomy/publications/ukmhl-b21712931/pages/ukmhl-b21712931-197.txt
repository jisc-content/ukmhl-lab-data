MORBID ANATOMY. 175 At first there was only a complaint of lameness, as from a sprain, but after some days there were swelling and tender- ness, which, from their persistence, led Dr. B. to diagnosti- cate a stellate crack of the bone, as a probable result of the fall, and of which he had met with a similar case two years previously. Dr. B. remarked that the bones of the wrist would act as a wedge upon the concave, articular sur- face of the radius; and that this case would explain the persistence of some cases of sprained wrist. Case published in the Med. Jour., with a figure (Vol. lviii. p. 99) ; and copied, with the figure, in Dr. F. PI. Hamiltonâ€™s work on Fractures. 1848. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1036. Bones of the forearm, with the lower portion of the hu- merus. There are appearances of. old fracture of the ulna, just below, and involving the elbow-joint. It may, how- ever, have been altogether, as it certainly was in part, a chronic arthritic affection. The articular surfaces are ir- regular, and new bone is thrown out about their edges. Outer portion of the head of the radius absorbed, and the rest worn away and eburnated, as is the corresponding portion of the humerus. Lower extremity of the radius enlarged; and the articular surface is irregular and fis- suied, as fiom old fracture into the joint. The elbow must have been flexed at a right angle. See next specimen. 1856. 1037. Lower extremity of the radius; the mate of the last specimen, and showing the same appearances. 1856. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1038. Comminuted fracture of the lower end of the radius, just above, and into the joint, and a second fracture, 24 in. above the joint. Fiom a man who received a very violent blow from a piece of machinery, Dec. 24th. On the 26th he entered the hospital (127, 248), with gangrene of the limb, in con- sequence of the exceeding tightness of the bandage that

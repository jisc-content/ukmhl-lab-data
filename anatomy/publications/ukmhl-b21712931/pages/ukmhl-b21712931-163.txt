SECOND DIVISION. MORBID ANATOINIY. SERIES XX. —BONES. I. Fractures. 938-9. Longitudinal section of six dorsal vertebrae, showing a fracture of the body of the fourth or fifth. The upper edge is broken off, and perhaps all around, and lies now rather in front of the bod}7, as in No. 140 in the Med. Soc.’s Museum ; thus allowing a backward displacement of the body. The thickness of this last is very much di- minished, but, as it would appear, rather by an absorption than by a crushing down of the cancelli; and the same change seems to be going on in the body of the vertebra below. Antero-posterior curvature moderate. A dry specimen. The other half of the same, in spirit; to show the spinal marrow and membranes, which, so far as appeared exter- nally, were quite uninjured. From a woman, get. twenty-five years, who fell 15 ft., and seventeen days afterwards entered the Hospital (114, 82). Lower extremities paralyzed, and sensibility diminished. Pain passing up leg on pinching left instep ; with the feel- ing as of an electrical shock when ice was applied to right foot and leg. Dej. involuntary, and catheter regularly required. Sank, with bed-sores and diarrhoea, and died rather less than nine weeks after the accident. 1864. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 940. Fracture of the spine. The patient was a sailor, twenty-four years of age, who fell 50 ft. on board of a vessel, and lived nearly seven weeks after the accident, under the care of Dr. G., at the Marine Hospital.

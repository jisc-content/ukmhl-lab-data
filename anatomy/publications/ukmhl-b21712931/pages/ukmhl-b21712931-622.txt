600 MORBID ANATOMY. From a married woman, ast. thirty-two years, who entered the hospital April 14th, 1851, and died Nov. 28th (169, 154). Duration of the disease uncertain, as she had been out of health for three or four years. Leucorrhcea for some years ; with a constant and offensive discharge whilst she was in the hospital. The “ catamenia,” which had previously been regular, was very profuse, and present during more than half the time, for about ten months pre- ceding Feb. 1851, but afterward became scanty. Much pain ; and especially during defecation, though no dysuria. Became very pallid, and much reduced, with universal ana- sarca for some months before death. (Amer. Jour, of Med.

It had been in the vagina for about an hour, and no inflammation resulted. 1852. Dr. Wm. E. Townsend. 2790. Wound of the vagina by a hay-hook (No. 3116). The bladder and intestine were also wounded ; and, the per- forations not having closed, a glass rod has been passed through, and indicates the course of the hook. 1857. Dr. J. P. Maynard, of Dedham. 2791. A superficial, lacerated wound of the nympha, that, in the recent state, was 14 or 2 in. in length, with some extrava- sation of blood into the surrounding tissues. The vagina was perhaps also lacerated near the meatus ; but it was thought that the parts may have been cut during their removal.

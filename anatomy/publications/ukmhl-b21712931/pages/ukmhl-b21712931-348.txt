326 MORBID ANATOMY. 1655-6. Paralytic calcaneo-valgus of both feet, in a girl set. eleven years, and the result of spina bifida , the astiagalus projecting on the inside of the foot, and making no pait of the ankle-joint. The front of the foot was higher than the heel; and the tendo-achillis was lengthened, instead of being shortened as usual. The three peronei muscles of the left foot, extens. longus comm., ext. poll, pedis, tib. ant. and tendo-achillis were divided ; and the same of the right, excepting the tib. ant. and tendo-achillis. Â°Four months after treatment the patient was able to walk upon the soles of the feet. 1869. 1657. Pes equinus in a lad, thirteen years of age, before treat- ment. Metatarsus doubled and twisted upon the taisus, so as to form at the line of union a sharp and prominent ridge upon the top and side of the foot. Astragalus lux- ated, and very much diminished in size; so that, in the course of treatment, it was almost impossible to keep it in place. Toes pressed backward so that the fifth was in contact with the back of the foot. 1658. The same, after treatment. Shows the wrinkles in the skin where it was stretched over the astragalus and tarso- metatarsal prominences. Tendo-achillis cut four times; tib. ant., flex, longus pollicis, and some fasciculi of the plantar fascia; adductor pollicis twice; also the ham- string muscles for a contraction of the leg upon the thigh. Dr. B. subsequently heard of the foot as still further im- proved. 1863.

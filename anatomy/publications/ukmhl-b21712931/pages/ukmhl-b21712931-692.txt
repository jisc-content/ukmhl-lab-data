MORBID ANATOMY. 670 months’ duration, and in the subcutaneous cellular tissue below the shoulder. There were two tumors, of which one weighed 4 lbs., and the other 1 lb. In four weeks the animal was at his work again. 1854. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. Melanotic tumors in the eye. (See page 411.) Malignant diseases and tumors of bones. (See page 288.) 3053. A malignant-looking mass, upon the upper and back part of the forearm; nearly as large as the fist, and black- ish upon the surface, as from hemorrhage. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 3054. A circular, flattened, very defined, fleshy-looking mass, about half as large as the fist; the edges projecting some- what beyond the base, with which a small portion of integ- ument was removed. Surface generally quite smooth, but somewhat lobulated about the edges, and nowhere covered by proper cutis. Integument immediately beneath the tumor quite healthy ; the origin of the mass being appar- ently quite superficial. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 3055. A perfectly superficial and fleshy growth from the side of the neck, that is figured by Dr. W. in his work on Tumors, and described by him as “ eiloides. It suggests the idea of a protrusion of three or four coils of inflated intestine; the coils being larger than the finger, and the whole diseased surface about 4 iu. in diameter. From a negress, set. fifteen years, who was not quite healthy. The wound healed well, but in eighteen months the disease reappeared. Dr. W. refused to operate again, and the operation was done by another surgeon. The disease soon returned again, and the patient died. On dissection, large tumors were found in the abdomen, with disease of the liver, and dropsy.-Dr. W. speaks of this as the only case of this very rare form of disease that he ‘ , ‘ Dr. J. C. Warren. had seen. looi. A very similar specimen to the above was in the Museum of the College of Physicians, in New York, in 18ol. It was from the neck of a negress, and was 5 or 6 in. in

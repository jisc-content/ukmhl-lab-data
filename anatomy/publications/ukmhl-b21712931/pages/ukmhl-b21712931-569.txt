MORBID ANATOMY. 547 2587. Compressed, irregularly ovoid concretion. TTr. ac., ox. of lime, and urates of ammonia and soda. No regular laminae. Very porous. Exterior covered with flattened tubercles. 2" 2"' by 1" 6'". 2588. Flattened, oval, handsomety marked. Ur. ac., ur. of potassa, and ox. of lime; the latter forming the dark-col- ored border. 1" S'" by 11'". 2589. Oblong, porous. Ur. ac. almost wholly; some ur. of soda and ox. of lime. Exterior shows marks of erosion, and the “ hour-glass constriction” very finely ; the groove is narrow and deep. 2" 7'" by 1" 7'". 2590. Oblong, oval. Ur. ac., ur. of soda, and ox. of lime; the latter forming the smooth, polished, pale, olive ex- terior. Cut surface, yellowish-fawn. 2" 2'" by 10'". 2591. Mulberry, oval calculus. Nucleus composed of ur. ac., and ur. of soda. Mostly composed of ox. of lime. Exterior covered with small tubercles of uniform size and dark color, interspersed with minute, light-colored, spherical concre- tions of the same composition. 1" V" by 1". The next seven specimens were given in 1847, by Dr. J. C. Warren. 2592. A calculus, botryoidal, and polished upon the surface. Nucleus, ur. of ammonia and ur. ac. Next portion con- sists of loosely deposited ur. of ammonia, ox. of lime, and tiiple phosphate mixed. Outer part is made up of very compact layers; ox. of lime, with a very little phosphate of lime. 1" 4'" by 1" 2"'. 2593. Large, irregularly cylindrical stone. Nucleus, ur. ac., and ur. of ammonia. Second layer consists of ur. ac., ur. ol ammonia and lime, and ox. of lime, forming an oval cal- culus, on the two long surfaces of which were deposited masses of ur. of ammonia, triple phosph. and phosph. of lime mixed. 1" 5"' by 1" 2'". 2594. Thin, oblong calculus. The dark, broad lamina consists of ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia; inside of which and exte- lioil} aie iorrned layers of the same, alternating with phosphate and oxalate of lime, and triple phosphate. 1" 2'" by 11"'. 2595. Oval calculus. Nucleus is made up of ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia, and succeeded by a broad portion of ur. ac.

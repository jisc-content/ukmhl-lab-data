MORBID ANATOMY. 192 irregular; there being a considerable osseous deposit about the edges as from chronic arthritis. In the recent state the head was connected with the acetabulum, and also with the shaft by light and long bands of fibro-cellular tissue. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1093. A fourth specimen. The patient, when eighty years of age, fell from a low chair upon the floor, and never walked afterward, except by pushing a chair before her ; being un- able to use crutches. Limb shortened 3 or 4 in. Little or no pain for two or three j7ears ; but, for two years before her death, which occurred five years and a half after the accident, the pain was extreme, and of a neuralgic char- acter. The bones having been macerated, there is seen to be a complete absorption of the neck, as usual in such cases; the new articular surfaces being very uneven, and with some eburnation, especially upon the shaft. Upon the original articular surface of the head is a considerable de- posit of new bone, as from chronic arthritis. 1860. Dr. H. E. Claj), of Wrenthcim. 1094. A fifth specimen ; upper third of the bone shown, with the head macerated. In the place of the neck is a slightly concave and rough surface. Remains of the head of the bone about two-thirds of its original size; fractured sur- face slightly rough, with some new deposit upon the artic- ular surface. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1095. A sixth specimen ; macerated. The head is mainly pre- served ; the articular surface being generally quite smooth, but with considerable deposits of new bone upon it. The opposing surfaces of the two fragments are cicatrized, and the neck is mostly absorbed, but a portion of it remains with each fragment. Bones atrophied. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1096. A seventh specimen ; in spirit. Fracture at the junction of the head and neck; with some fibrous union, but a con- siderable separation between the fragments. Neck wholly absorbed. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

22 HEALTIIY ANATOMY. 219. Left scapula; adult. Union of acromion very imperfect. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 220. Scapula from some loose bones that had been collected by Dr. W. The acromion process is firmly united to the body of the bone; but the line of union is perfectly dis- tinct, and the specimen might very readily be mistaken for one of old fracture. The epiphysis at the lower angle is not yet full}’’ united to the body of the bone. f 221. Scapula, evidently the mate of the last, and found amongst some of Dr. W.’s loose bones, though not with the last specimen. A large portion of the acromion has been broken off and lost; and from appearances, it may have been since the bone was prepared. Otherwise there is the same appearance of union between what remains of the acromion and the body of the bone that is seen in the last specimen. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. There are also two other specimens in the museum ; and the anomaly may be considered as sufficiently common. 222-9. A series of scapulse, to show the development of the supra-scapular notch. 1849. Dr. 0. W. Holmes. 230-1. Two clavicles, showing the difference of curvature that is occasionally seen in this bone. 1849. Dr. 0. W. Holmes. 232-3. Lower portion of the humerus, showing the supra- condyloid process. Two specimens, from different sub- jects ; prepared by Dr. II., and reference given to a descrip- tion of this anomaly by Mr. John Struthers, in the Brit. & For. Med. Review, for July, 1854. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 234. A third specimen, by Dr. H. The ligament that passes from the process to the inner condyle of the humerus is shown. 1859. Dr. R. M. Hodges.

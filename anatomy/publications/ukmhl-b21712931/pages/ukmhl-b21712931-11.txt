3 INTRODUCTION. The Medical Department of Harvard University was es- tablished in the year 1782. In 1808 Dr. John C. Warren was appointed Adjunct Professor of Anatomy and Surgery ; and, when that chair was vacated, in the year 1815, by the death of his father, Dr. W. was appointed to fill his place. How faith- fully and honorably to himself, and to the College, he per- foi mod the duties of his office, and during a long period of yeais, is well known to the profession. The zeal with which he pm sued his favorite studies, and with which he improved the opportunities that a very extensive professional practice afforded him, led to the collection of a great number of patho- logical and other specimens; and, on resigning his professor- ship, in 1847, the greater part of this collection was presented to the College, and with it the sum of $6,000, for its preserva- tion and increase. In acknowledgment of so valuable a dona- tion, the Corporation of the University voted that the Museum should be called by the name of its founder. Unfortunately, Dr. W.’s time was so fully occupied by his professional prac- tice, that but,*little was left to him for those records, or even references, upon which the value of the pathological portion of a museum so much depends. Before the transfer, however, was made to the College, Dr. W. had a record made of the specimens, from his dictation ; but it was, for the most pait, and excepting a few references, a mere enumeration. . e teudency to preserve interesting specimens is very strong in so devoted an anatomist and surgeon as Dr. W. always had been ; and the consequence was, that he collected a large num- ber of what might essentially be called duplicates. Patholog- ical specimens that resemble each other very closely are ofte°n preserved in reference to their clinical history ; and the diver-

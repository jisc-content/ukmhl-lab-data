568 MORBID ANATOMY. 2692. A calculus from the bladder of a sperm whale. It is perfectly white, of a fine, compact structure, very dis- tinctly laminated ; of a tetrahedral form, with well-marked fa^ettes, and about l£ in. in diameter. A large number of calculi, and very nearly resembling this specimen, were removed from the bladder, and weighed altogether 86 lbs.; one of them was about as large as the two fists. The whale was a very large old male, and so much emaciated as to furnish but very little oil. One of the calculi was analyzed by Dr. C. T. Jackson, and found to consist of the phosph. of magnesia and ammonia, with some phosph. of lime. (See Catalogue of the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet, No. 635.) One of these specimens was sent to the Hunterian Museum, and is represented in the Catalogue, Plate 17, fig. 6. 1868. Soc. for Med. Improvement. 2693. Elongated concretion, 1 in. in length, and about § in. on cut surface. Phosph. and carb. of lime. Renal. Nucleus eccentric. 1800. Dr• J- Nichols. 2694. An irregular calculus, and renal without doubt. Phosph. and carb. of lime, and triple phosph. 2" by 1". 1800. Dr. J. Nichols. 2695. Renal calculus; very irregular. Phosph. of lime, carb. of lime, and triple phosph. of ammonia and magnesia. jgQQ Dr. J. Nichols. 2696. Fragments of a calculus, removed from the bladder after death. (Hospital, 67, 184.) The patient, a man, set. thirty years, had had very urgent symptoms, and moie oi less for eighteen years. Lithotrity was performed by Dr. B., Oct. 13th and 18th, Nov. 10th and 24th, and Dec. 15th. At the first operation the calculus was reported as large. Death occurred on the 11th of March. Bladdei and kid- neys much inflamed. The fragments are from the size of a small bean to that of a pigeon’s egg, and irregular in shape ; the rough surfaces being smoothed by attrition, and partly by phosphatic deposit. One of the calculi exam- ined by Dr. Bacon, and found to consist essentially of triple phosph., with phosph. of lime, carb. of lime, and a considerable amount of organic matter. 1857. Dr. H. J. Bigelow.

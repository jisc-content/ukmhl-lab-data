397 MORBID ANATOMY. 1991. Seven or eight very light bodies from the size of the tip of the little finger, to that of the thumb, and referred to by Dr. Warren, in his work on Tumors (p. 19), under the head of Icthyosis cornea. From a girl, aet. fourteen. — Examined by Dr. White, who made out epidermal scales on their exterior. 1847. Dr. J. O. Warren. 1992. A fleshy excrescence, about as large as the top of the thumb, and arising from the scalp; scarcely covered by cutis, and resulted, perhaps, from a sebaceous follicle. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1993. An excrescence, smaller than the last, and having, per- haps, the same origin. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1994. A soft, shrivelled, brownish, cutaneous excresence, about the size of the top of the finger. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1995. A wax model of the face, showing a horny growth from the forehead, about 10 in. in length, and in. in diameter at the largest part. From Paris, and well known in ana- tomical museums. In 1845, Dr. J.

A small one is seen upon one of the cheeks ; and she had formerly had one removed from the hand. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1996. Cast, in plaster, of a horn that grew from just above the eyebrow of an old woman, ninety-two years of age, and that was of six years’ duration. The form was conical, and the extremity curved downward ; length, along its convex- ity i °i Base soft, and bulging; the circumference being 4|- in. The rest of the growth was hard to the feel, fibrous in appearance, and grooved upon the surface. Sev- eral similar growths existed upon different parts of the face, elsewhere, but none of them projected more than a line or two ; two of these are shown upon the cast. A few

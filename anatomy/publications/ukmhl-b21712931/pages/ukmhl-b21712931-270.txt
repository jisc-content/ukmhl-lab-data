248 MORBID ANATOMY. 1330. Transverse section of a femur, removed by Dr. W., in an operation for necrosis. Bone very much enlarged ; struc- ture light, and in a cavity in its substance a small seques- trum is seen. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1331. A portion of the femur, apparently ; 6 in. in length, and about lj in. in diameter. Where it has been sawed across there is no trace of a cavity, but a uniform and rather light bony structure ; the very surface only being compact. No periosteal deposit. The other extremity terminates in two long and strong bony projections, or prongs they may be called ; with a considerable amount of caries upon the inner surface, though the longest one has for the most part a smooth and cicatrized appearance. Perhaps from a case of necrosis ; and not certainly human. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1332. The seven cervical vertebrae of an adult. Bodies and articulating processes extensively fused, with considerable deposit of new bone, and a strong inclination of the atlas toward the left side. Bones quite solid. 1863. Dr. 0. W. Holmes. 1333. Eight dorsal vertebrae; bodies anchylosed along the front, and toward the right side, by the growth of new bone from the edges of the bodies. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1334. Five dorsal, and two lumbar vertebrae; exostoses from the edges of the bodies, with partial anchylosis. From a laborer, about sixty years old. When eighteen years of age he fell down the hold of a vessel, and ever afterward had trouble in his back, with general rheumatism; dying at last of cardiac disease. 1866. Dr. J. S. Jones. 1335. Three lumbar vertebrae ; a thick mass of new bone unites two of the bodies upon the front, and toward one side. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1336. Specimen very similar to the last. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1337. Two lumbar vertebrae ; bodies anchylosed as in the above, but interesting on account of the extensive fusion of the articulating processes upon one side. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

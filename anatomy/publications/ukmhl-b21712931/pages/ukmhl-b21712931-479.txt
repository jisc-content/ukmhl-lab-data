457 MORBID ANATOMY. Just before death there was vomiting of glairy mucus, with minute ‘ coffee-ground ’ particles, and for three months before death a movable tumor could be felt in the epigas- tric region. 1862. Dr. Alfred Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 2209. Colloid disease, from a very healthy-looking woman, forty-five years of age, who had been dyspeptic for about a year; with frequent vomiting, distress at the stomach, and loss of appetite for five or six weeks. Tumor in epi- gastrium when Dr. S. first saw her, two weeks before death. Her appearance of health was preserved to the last; and she was out as usual within a month of her death. The disease was strongly marked anatomically; involv- ing the whole pyloric portion, to the extent of 4 or 5 in., and just encroaching upon the duodenum. The mucous membrane was first affected, and afterward the muscular; the submucous cellular being but little if at all implicated. Maximum thickness two-thirds of an inch. Surface slightly ulcerated. From the anterior face of the organ there pro- jected externally a mass of the same disease, of consider- able size ; and from the posterior face a similar, but small- er mass. There were also two or three small masses near the small curvature, with traces of the same in the omen- tum near the large curvature; but not elsewhere. The stomach was large; and the mucous surface, where not diseased, was uniformly red, but without any other change. In the preparation one-lialf of the pyloric portion is pre- served ; the other half being in the cabinet of the Soc. for Med. Improvement (No. 957). 1850. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2210. Pyloric portion of the stomach scirrhous. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2211. A second specimen. The whole circumference is involved to the extent of an inch and a half; and the thickening of the muscular coat is well shown. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2212. Cancerous disease of the whole pyloric portion, to the extent of 3 in. It is firm, if not dense, to the feel; and

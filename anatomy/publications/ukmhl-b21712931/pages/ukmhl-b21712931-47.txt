C. Warren. 253. Diaphragm, distended and dried. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 254. Pectus sternalis muscle, in connection with the bone and cartilage; in spirit. For a figure of this case, with re- marks by Dr. Holmes, see Med. Jour. Vol. lvii. p. 321. 1858. Dr. 11. M. Hodges. 255. A second case (musculus sternalis). This was met with in the dissecting-room, by Dr. Hodges, and described as follows: — “ Origin has no direct connection with the sternum until it reaches the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs, to which it is attached, giving off also a small strip to the sternum. The upper right slip is continuous with the clavicular portion of the pectoralis ; the under one with the sternal part of same; the left slip is blended with the pec- toralis of that side. At its lower insertion it passes wholly underneath the pectoralis; at its upper part, or origin, it is continuous with the sterno-mastoid. The part of the pectoralis arising from third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages is nearly wanting.”

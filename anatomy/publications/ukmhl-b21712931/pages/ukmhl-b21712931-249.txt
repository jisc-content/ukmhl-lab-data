Surface generally not very rough, but more so toward the upper back part. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1243. Os calcis ; free surface, rough and porous, and upper ar- ticular surface superficially carious ; structure light. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1244. Last 5 in. of the tibia, enlarged, and rough upon the sur- face, from periosteal deposit, with some caries. From a woman, set. forty-five (Hospital, 123, 76).

The surface is very rough and reticulated, with some appearance of caries ; On section, a small portion of the circumference of the wall is quite dense and healthy; the rest, consisting of' a coarsely reticulated structure, but with scarcely a trace of the periosteal deposit, that seemed to be so marked exter- nally. The cavity of the bone is of full size. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1246. Ulna, enlarged ; rough and porous on the surface. On a transverse section the enlargement is seen to be altoo-ether due to an old periosteal deposit; the bone being scarcely attected ; structure quite light. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1247 Lower portion of the femur, much enlarged by an old, thick, periosteal deposit, and which has the pinkish tinge that is sometimes seen.

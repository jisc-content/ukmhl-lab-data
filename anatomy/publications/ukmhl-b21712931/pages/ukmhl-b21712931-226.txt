MORBID ANATOMY. 204 tion ; the distinction between the dead and living bone be- ing strongly marked. A very interesting appearance in this specimen is the action of the absorbents upon the bone that is dead, showing that originally the separation was to have taken place lower down than where it was going on at the time of amputation or death. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1158. Fracture of the tibia and fibula; not old. A considera- ble quantity of new bone is seen upon the surface of the fragments ; and the fibula is united, but the tibia is not; a separation of dead bone is going on from both fragments of the tibia. 1858. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1159. Both bones fractured at about the lower third; from a young subject. Union irregular, and rather imperfect. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1160. A preparation, by Dr. H., showing the result of a neg- lected fracture. The foot is strongly flexed upon the leg ; the tibia is bent to a right, and the fibula to an acute, angle ; and the union, though very close, is not osseous. The patient, a healthy lad, sixteen years of age, was observed, when two or three days old, to have some trouble with his leg, and soon afterward the fibula was found to be broken. No treatment. At the age of two years the leg began to yield, and in six months it was bent to a right angle. When he was eight years old, the bones were re- moved at the angle, the tendo-achillis was cut, and for a time it was kept in proper position. The mother, however, entirely neglected the child, and the leg was soon nearly as bad as ever. Last year Dr. II. amputated the limb, and the lad has since done well with a Palmer’s leg. 1857. Dr. J. E. Hathaway, of Worcester. 1161. Cast, in plaster, of a foot and leg, that must have most remarkably resembled the last case. The patient, a little girl, eleven years of age (Hospital, 57, 102), broke her leg when six years old; and, her mother being a drunkard, nothing was done for her. The tibia seemed to have been broken about 2£ in., and the

372 MORBID ANATOMY. and a half after the operation. (See next specimen.) 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1816. A wax injection of the above tumor, from which the skin has been dissected, and which resembles in form, a solid bundle of common earth-worms. The convoluted arteries suddenly expanding and contracting, mutually to inosculate, were inextricably interwoven. Dr. B. reports that he has seen two cases of this dis- ease, in each of which the finger was affected j one of the patients was a young girl, and the other an old woman. He also refers to Breschet’s description of the disease in the work above referred to. (No. 1812.) 1858. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 1817. Naevus, from the foot of a little girl two years old, who was brought to the hospital April 28th, 1868. (133, 232.) A tumor, of the size of a pullet’s egg, occupied nearly the whole dorsum of the foot, and encroached upon the toes, of which the second and third were widely separated. It was very firm to the feel, adherent to the integument, scarcely movable, and occasionally exuded blood from a purplish spot upon the summit. There was no appearance of disease in the sole of the foot, and no p'ain ; and the motions were not impaired. At birth, the tumor was blu- ish and equally large, but translucent and swayed about. It seemed to have undergone a spontaneous cuie. On the 29tli it was removed, with the second and third toes, and was found to be quite defined; and on the 14th of May she was discharged well. 1868.

This specimen and the next were sent to the Museum by Mr. R., the son of the proprietor of the large cutlery establishment, at Greenfield, in this State. 18G3. Mr. Frank Russell, of G. 2081. A section of the tusk of a small African elephant, in- cluding the pulp cavity, and showing a large iron slug embedded in its substance; with a growth of new sub- stance upon the outer surface, and a little of the same ' within the cavity. 1863. Mr. F. Russell, of G. 2082. Cranium of an Alpine marmot, showing a lateral devia- tion of the incisors, and their consequent elongation. The lower jaw is somewhat necrosed; the result, perhaps, of fracture. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2083. The same, in a woodchuck. The left upper incisor has perforated the right maxillary bone, and thus forms con- siderably more than a circle. A large portion of the right upper incisor is gone, and the whole anterior poition of the cranium is remarkably deflected toward the right side. The simple perforation in this case shows well how a bone may yield to long-continued pressure, and without becoming diseased. 1859. Mr. J. E. Cobb. 2084. Two upper, adult, molar teeth, strongly united by the fangs. 1862. 2085. Section of an adult, molar tooth, showing how, in caries of the crown, the pulp cavity is encroached upon by the formation of new material, so as to prevent an external opening. 1857. x , . Mr. William A. Thurston, vied, student. 2086. A large spermaceti whaleâ€™s tooth, upon the fang of which there is formed a very large and irregular tumor, consisting, apparently, of a mass of dentine. One longitudinal half is shown, and the other half is in the museum of the Bos- ton Soc. of Nat. History. 1859. George II. Folger, Esq. 2087. A section of an irregular mass of dentine, and that proba- bly lay as a loose body in the cavity of the tooth of a

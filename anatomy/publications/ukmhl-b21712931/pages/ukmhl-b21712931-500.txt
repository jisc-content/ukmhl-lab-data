478 MORBID ANATOMY. the abdomen came on, and in twenty-two hours he died with acute peritonitis. 1849. Dr. Wm. E. Coale. 2282. Two ulcers in the duodenum, adjoining the pylorus. One is circular, quite deep, and ^ in. or more in diameter. The other is smaller, less regular, and has perforated the peritoneal cavity. 1857. Dr. A. A. Gould. 2283. Two chronic ulcers in the duodenum, not far from the pylorus. One is about two-thirds of an inch in length; the base is formed by the pancreas, and at one point it approaches very near to the peritoneum. The other is less deep, and smaller. From a child, five years of age, that had acute pleurisy ; and at the end of a week died with symptoms of internal hemorrhage, after three hours’ continuance. — A large amount of blood was found in the stomach, and throughout the intestines ; and on moving the body after death, blood escaped from the mouth and anus. (Med. Jour. Yol. lvii. p. 450.) 1858. Dr. F. II. Gray. Ulcer in a large serpent, just below the pylorus; about one-third of an inch in extent, and with a parasite hanging from it. (See No. 285.) 2284. Thibert’s model. Very extensive ulceration of the mu- cous membrane of the small intestine ; engorgement, but without induration, etc. 1849. Dr. J. Ware. 2285. Ulceration of the small intestine. The ulcers extended throughout this intestine; and were shown, microscopi- cally, not to be formed directly in the old tissues, but in a new material that was first formed in them ; this last being “ composed of fibroid tissue, some fibro-plastic elements, and many small nuclei with small nucleoli.” Perforation took place six or seven feet from the pylorus. From the same case as No. 2197. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxi. p. 241.) 1864: Ev. E. Ellis. 2286. Ulceration of the small intestine, from the same patient • as No. 2185. The ulcers were scattered throughout the whole of the small and large intestine, and resembled those in the stomach; largest and deepest in the jejunum, where some of them were perhaps two-thirds of an inch in diam- eter ; dark gray and cicatrizing in the large intestine.

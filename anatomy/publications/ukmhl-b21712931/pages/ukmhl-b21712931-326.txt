304 MORBID ANATOMY. 1526. Remains of the lower jaw, from a case of epithelial can- cer in a middle-aged man. The disease began in the lip, which was removed, and it subsequently reappeared about the lower jaw ; a very large cavity opening externally, and from which fatal hemorrhage at last occurred. From the dissecting-i’oom ; and, having been injected, the arteries about the seat of disease were found obliterated. Upon the right side a portion of the ramus remains, but otherwise it is destroyed nearly to the median line. Upon the other side the structure of the bone is light where it terminated in the disease; but there is very little deposit upon the surface, and none of the delicate spiculae so often seen in encephaloid disease. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1527. Effect of a cancerous tumor developed in the ramus of the lower jaw. The preparation consists of a quantity of loose, dry, white, crumbling bone; the head and condyloid process in connection, and looking as if they might be rubbed down between the thumb and finger. The bone is sound where it was cut through, but the ramus and neigh- borhood of the angle are quite destroyed. From a man thirty years of age. Tumor over the ramus, of the size of a hen’s egg, hard, tense, and inflamed. Removed at the articulation. 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1528. Thibert’s model. “ Osteo-sarcoma ” of upper jaw. Re- moved from a young man, seventeen years of age; per- fectly relieved, but died a month afterward from pneumonia. Teeth separated from each other, and scattered over the tumor. “ Tumor formed mostly by a hypertrophy of the upper maxillary bone, without softening.” External ap- pearances shown. 1529. The above tumor after removal. 1847. Dr. Geo. Hayward. 1530. Humerus, showing a roughness with some absorption for some distance above the inner condyle; the result of its connection with a large cancerous tumor. The bone is otherwise sound. 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigeloio.

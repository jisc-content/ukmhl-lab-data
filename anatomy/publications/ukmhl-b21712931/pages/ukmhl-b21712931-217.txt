MORBID ANATOMY. 195 1103. A strongly marked specimen of recent, oblique fracture of the upper half of the femur; neck scarcely involved. From a man who was thrown down in the street, and kicked. Shortening, If in. (Hospital, 97, 220.) 1862. Dr. G. II. Gay. 1104. Portion of a femur, showing a recent and transverse fracture of the shaft midway. From a man who was run over by a heavily loaded wagon. (Hospital, 97, 222.) 1861. Mr. John Homans, med. student. 1105. Fracture of shaft of femur, midway. Union strong, but quite irregular. The fragments form an angle outward, are not in apposition, and the upper fragment, as so gener- ally happens, is in front of the lower. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1106. The femur of a large male, dissecting-room subject. Upon the anterior and outer part of the bone, midway, is an appearance as if it may have been cut by an axe; the bone being raised, as it often is in old sabre cuts of the skull, and to the extent of more than 4 in. The surface is pei fectly healthy about it; but upon the head and neck there is some osseous deposit. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1107. Femur curved somewhat abruptly at upper third outward and forward; outline regular. The result of an old frac- ture. Sawed lengthwise ; bone atrophied, and the cavity interrupted at curvature. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1108. A second specimen, in which the curvature is very much greater. Sawed open, and the canal is seen to be inter- rupted. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. 1109. A thiid specimen; similar to the last. New osseous giowths about condyles, as from chronic arthritis; and some about the seat of injury. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1110. Poitions of the shaft of the femur, removed for ununited fracture midway; one is If in., and the other 2f in. in

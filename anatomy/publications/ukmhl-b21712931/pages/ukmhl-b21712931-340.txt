MORBID ANATOMY. 318 affected with chronic ostitis. Structure light; surface very rough; cavity obliterated ; ends rounded, and from the fibula there had probably been a sequestrum discharged. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1612. Portion of the femur from a stump eleven and a half weeks after amputation. The extremity is closed, and there is a considerable growth of new bone about it. (See No. 1426.) 1864. Dr. R. M. Hodges. Encysted disease of the ramus of the lower jaw, and nearly or quite half as large as the fist; in spirit. The parietes look thin and stiff, as if mostly membranous. The inner surface, which is pretty fully exposed, looks gener- ally smooth and polished, though in some parts rough as from a deposit of fibrine. Removed from the articulation to some way beyond the angle, 1847. See No. 1483. Dr. J. C. Warren. For a case of dropsy of the antrum, connected with a misplaced tooth. (See No. 577.) SERIES XXI.â€”SOFT PARTS CONNECTED WITH THE BONES. 1614-5. Old and transverse fracture of the cartilage of one of the upper ribs. A long, section having been made, one- half has been preserved in spirit, and the other half dried ; showing that the union is not by bone, though there is a small cretaceous mass adjoining the line of fracture. This last is probably due to the age of the subject, as the same change is seen in the cartilage at a distance from the frac- ture." 1855. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1616. Cast of a part of the chest, showing a large and veiy deep hollow cavity about the lower part of the sternum. The subject is rather a feeble man, and attributes the de- formity to a fall upon a wash-tub when he was two yeais old. It has existed as long as he can remember, and lias been as large as it is now, proportionally to his size. 1868. Dr. Henry II. A.. Beach.

Phosph. of lime and triple phosph. Outer portion arranged in lamime. 1" 4'" by 10'", 2688. Urethral calculus, from a case of abscess of the pros- tate, etc. (No. 2876). Form somewhat irregularly ovoid ; and measures in. by & in. Surface fawn-colored,’ smooth, and toward the large extremity polished to some extent. There is also shown another small stone, that was removed at the same time; 2£ by 1£ lines, flattened, and having both surfaces quite polished, as if by attrition against the large one. The large calculus is evidently phosphate upon the surface ; but it has not been analyzed, as, on account of its size, it was desirable to preserve it entire. 1868. J>. H. J. Bigelow. 2689. A calculus from the bladder of a child, who was trans- fixed b}'- a hay-hook (No. 3116). Examined by Dr. Ba- con, who remarked that it was evidently of rapid forma- tion. Length nearly § in., and thickness £ in. Exterior rough, with small tubercular projections. On section, it is seen to be hollow. The shell is about a line in thick- ness, and is composed of triple phosphate and phosphate of lime, with considerable animal matter. The large cav- ity within contains only a thin, shrivelled membrane, loosely adherent to the walls, and probably the remains of a 0„QnSl°AUgk' 1857‘ Dr- J- P■ Maynard, of Dedham. 2690.

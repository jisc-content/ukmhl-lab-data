23 healthy anatomy. 235. A humerus, showing an opening through the olecranon fossa. 1849. Dr. 0. W. Holmes. 236. The two humeri of a Flat-head Indian, showing the same. 1860. Museum Fund. 237. One humerus, and parts of four others; and in four of these there is a similar and large opening. These bones are undoubtedly of Indian origin, having been dug up on Long Island, in Boston harbor, when a regiment was encamped there in 1861. Eight or ten individuals were found, and Dr. P. A. O’Connell, the surgeon of the regi- ment, and a former student of Dr. C., to whom the speci- mens were sent, stated that he examined the humeri, with especial reference to the existence of an opening through the fossa, and he believed that the humerus that is here shown was the only one in which it did not exist. Many years ago, Dr. Charles T. Jackson noticed this opening in the humerus of an Indian, from this neighborhood, and subsequently in another from the State of Maine. Dr. J. Wyman has also met with it in the N. American Indians ; and, in the year 1853, at the Garden of Plants, in Paris, he saw the skeletons of seven negroes, with seven perforations in the fourteen humeri; three of them being perforated upon both sides, and one upon one side only. See Med. Journal, Vol. lxvi. p. 233. 1862. Dr. Henry G. ClarTc. 238. A portion of the left femur, showing a growth of bone from the linea aspera, and rather below the middle of the shaft, about two inches in length, three-fourths of an inch in height, thick at the base, and thinner towards the edge, and inclining toward the outer aspect of the bone. Dr. II. referred to a notice, by Mr. Humphry, in his work on the Skeleton, of this form of growth, under the name of Su- pra condyloid process; ” Mr. H. quoting two anatomists, who had described it, and regarding it as the analogue of what is found in the horse (No. 158) and the rhinoceros. 1859. Dr. E. M. Hodges.

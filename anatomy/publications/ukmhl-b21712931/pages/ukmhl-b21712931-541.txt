MORBID ANATOMY. 519 figured in Jones and Sieveking’s Pathological Anatomy (Am. Ed. 1854), p. 555, fig. 254, a. In one of the cysts an octohedral crystal, probably of oxalate of lime, was found.” The bladder was tolerably developed. 1862. Dr. T. E. Francis, of Brookline. For a remarkably similar case to the above, that also occurred in the practice of Dr. F., see No. 848, and for two other cases of encysted kidney in monstrosities see Nos. 820 and 788 in the Cabinet of the Society for Med. Improvement. As this condition of the organs may occur in a monstrosity, so may it in a subject otherwise well formed, as suggested in a previous case (No. 2452). 2456. A cyst, about half as large again as the fist, in the upper • extremity of the kidney, and cut open. It is quite thin, and was filled with a thin fluid when recent. The organs O seemed to be affected with Bright’s disease, and two or three other small cysts were found upon the surface. From a gentleman, set. sixty-three. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2457. A specimen, similar to the last. Cyst entire, and 1£ to 2 in. in diameter. Organ otherwise healthy, externally, excepting two or three other quite small cysts. 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. 2458. Hydronephrosis. The kidney is of about the usual size, but no trace of renal substance is visible to the naked eye, though some slight irregularities are seen upon the inner suriace. No cause ascertained for the dilatation ; the ureter arising rather abruptly from the sac, and being lather small, though pervious throughout. The contained fluid resembled urine, and amounted to about §ij. The othei kidney was about three times the usual size. — From a healthy woman, set. sixty-six, who died of strang. hernia. ■^^7. Dr. J. G. Neil son, of Charlestown. 2459. Kidney and ureter, injected by Dr. Hodges, and dried. The kidney is very small, lobulated in correspondence with the infundibula, and extremely thin. The ureter is 2J in. in diameter at its upper portion, about as large as the finger toward the bladder, and much smaller midway. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson.

Cast, in plaster, by Dr. L., of a fissure of the uvula, from an “ acephalous foetus.” This fissure I have met with several times in this form of monstrosity, and am not aware that it has been before noticed. 1851. Dr. E. Leigh. 842. An acephalous and rhinencephalous foetus. The upper lip has a contracted and somewhat cicatrized look ; and about an inch above it are two eyes fused; the iris of each is distinct, and the inner canthus is upon the median line. The nose, or proboscis, is ^ in.- above the eyes ; § in. long, J in. in diameter, and with an orifice at the extremity that opens into a cavity of considerable size. Ears bent per- manently forward; and neck quite wanting. The brain about equals a hen’s egg in bulk, and is covered by arach- noid.

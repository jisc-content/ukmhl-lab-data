Old fracture of the metatarsal bone of a bird, and prob- ably an eagle. Union very irregular, and with some short- ening. Nate also shown. 1859. 1167. Fracture of the under surface of the astragalus; and â€¢ perhaps one or two of the adjoining tarsal bones are in- volved. Cartilage entirely gone from the upper surface, and the surface generally is quite smooth. Articular sur- face of tibia covered with a soft, cellular tissue. In spirit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. For very numerous and probably partial fractures in a rickety skeleton, see next series. II. Dislocations. 1168. The cervical vertebrae, showing a complete rupture of the intervertebral substance between the sixth and seventh bodies, and a dislocation forward of the sixth upon the seventh, upon the right side ; a very small piece of bone only being broken from the body of the seventh. From a laborer, twenty-one years of age, who entered the hospital (13, 90) three hours after a bank of earth fell upon him. When first seen he groaned constantly, and complained of universal pain. Sensibility sufficiently well. Some power of motion of upper extremities, but none of the parts below. Could not raise his head from the pillow ; and any attempt by another to raise it, or the upper ex- tremities, caused pain. Skin very hot; and pulse 80. He lived thirty days ; and, meanwhile, the symptoms were about the same. Respiration entirely diaphragmatic. Urine retained at first, but afterward involuntary. Dejections mostly, if not wholly, involuntary; and toward the last costive. Abdomen tense and tympanitic. Very restless, and groaned much ; but could not localize his pain. On the fifteenth day two large sloughs were reported over the sacrum, and from that time he gradually sank. 1847. Dr. J. V. Warren.

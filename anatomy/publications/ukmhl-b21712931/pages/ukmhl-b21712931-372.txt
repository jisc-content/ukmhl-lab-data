350 MORBID ANATOMY. to have pain and numbness in the left lower extremity; the pain being mostly below the knee, and gradually in- creasing until it became very intense. Three weeks before death the left foot became gangrenous, and the outer half of the foot and leg at last sphacelated; the inner portion never becoming affected. A line of demarcation having formed below the knee, Dr. M. amputated the thigh, but onl}r as a palliative ; the branches of the profunda bleeding freely, though the femoral was closed. The operation quite relieved the pain in the leg, and the patient died on the sixth day. The right external iliac arteiy was filled with recent fibrine ; and, upon the left side, some of the arteries below the knee, as well as the femoral, were filled with old fibrine. (See Med. Jour.

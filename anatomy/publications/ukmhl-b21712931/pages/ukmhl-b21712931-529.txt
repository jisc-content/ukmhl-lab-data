MORBID ANATOMY. 507 several ineffectual attempts at a passage having previ- ously been made. From a woman, set. forty-three years. In 1856 she com- plained frequently of distress at the epigastrium. Jan. 17th, 1857, she had violent colic, with much retching and vomiting, but was relieved in a few hours. On the 26th of Jan., the 5th of March, and the 29th of April, she had similar attacks, and each was more severe than the pre- ceding. On the 2d of May the pain was relieved by ether- ization ; five copious, thin, yellow discharges followed, with much prostration, and she died the next morning. There was no jaundice. (Med. Jour. Yol. lvi. p. 367.) 1858. Dr. G. EUis. 2401. Gall-bladder opening into the duodenum, 3 in. from the pylorus. The organ, which was firmly adherent to the in- testine and to the colon, was contracted, thickened, looked upon the inner surface like an old tuberculous cavity, and was distended with blood, the source of which last was not found. The opening into the intestine was about mid- way between the fundus and the neck, and was perhaps two lines in diameter. In the cavity of the organ was a large gall-stone (No. 2402) ; and the cystic duct seemed to have been obliterated. From a woman, set. sixty-five years, who had been well until the 1st of March, when she had an attack of bilious vomiting ; followed by deep jaundice, which continued un- til her death on the 9th of July. There was also pain in the hypochondria; nausea, thirst, a burning sensation in the epigastrium, and an irregular, knobby feel to the edge of the liver. (Hospital, 197, 206 ; and Med. Jour. Vol. lii. p. 498.) 1855. Dr. G. Ellis. III. Biliary Calculi. Many of these specimens have faded, more or less, since they were collected, from exposure to the light, so that their color will not often be referred to. 2402.

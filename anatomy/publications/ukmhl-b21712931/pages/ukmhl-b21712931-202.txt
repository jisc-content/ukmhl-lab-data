MORBID ANATOMY. 180 twelve years of age, who was accidentally shot. The ball entered the left hip, shattered the trochanter, emerged at the fissure between the nates, and passed through the other buttock. Not much pain ; and hemorrhage slight. Loose bone was removed from the trochanter, and he died on the fourth day. A hospital case (106, 86). In the preparation the trochanter is quite gone, and the shaft of the bone is somewhat injured. The ischium is also broken, and a portion of the tuberosity has been car- ried away. 1864. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1055. A partial fracture or fissure in the neck of the femur, in a man forty-two years of age ; the upper half of the bone is shown. There wras also a transverse fracture of the same bone, midway, and a fracture of the spine. The patient, a laborer, fell through two stories of a building, upon a hard floor ; entered the hospital (67, 212), and died on the eighteenth day from the accident. The fissure involves about three-fourths of the circum- ference of the neck, the inner anterior portion only being spared ; and to a considerable extent it runs along very near to the head of the bone. It is quite closed, but there is considerable motion between the head and neck, when the head and shaft are grasped, and moved upon each other ; and the fissure would undoubtedly result in a per- fect fracture if much force were used. From the fracture of the shaft, midway, a fissure extends upward and toward the neck; but it does not meet the one above described. This case has been reported, and the specimen figured in a paper upon Fractures of the Femur, by Prof. R. D. Mussey, in the Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc. for April, 1857. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. Dr. Hamilton also refers to it (p. 84) in his work on v Fractures. 1056. Oblique and recent fracture through the neck of the fe- mur, terminating inferiorly in a sharp point, and just in- volving the head of the bone, which last only is shown. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren.

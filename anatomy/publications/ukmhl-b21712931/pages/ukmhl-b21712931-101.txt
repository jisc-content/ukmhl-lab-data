At the age of one year and eleven months menstruation commenced, and has continued regularly since; and about the same time the breasts and hips began to enlarge. During the last year she has been in this city, on a visit, and was seen by many of the medical profession; Dr. Gay having seen the menstrual fluid as it was being discharged. There is hair over the pubes, and in the axillm. One of the breasts is shown in the photograph, and is seen to be quite large;.■ and the hips, which measure 27£ in. in circumference, are so large as to amount almost to a deformity. Her general health is perfect. The first set of teeth is complete, but none of them have begun to loosen. Her manners and tastes are those of a child of her age; and she has never, so far as her mother is aware, shown any sexual feeling. The photograph was taken when she was two years and eight months old. An account of her case, which, how- ever, has not been seen here, was published by Dr. John King, in the Medical Journal at Cincinnati, in 1868. 1869. Dr. Benj. E. Cottincj.

MORBID ANATOMY. 417 told her that it was not congenital. Had often had gum- boils, and was subject to nasal catarrh. Deglutition diffi- cult, and speech thick; and she was obliged to breathe with her mouth open when she took cold. The gums were hypertrophied in each jaw, and upon each side of the teeth, though not uniformly. Two large masses in the roof of the mouth came together in front, but not posteri- orly. There was a dull pain in the jaws most of the time ; and the growths had quite a hard, cartilaginous feeling. On the 26th Dr. J. M. Warren removed all of the upper teeth, and most of the disease in the palate. In October she returned to the hospital, and on the 9th Dr. Hodges removed the disease in both jaws with the scissois, gouge, and saw ; the hemorrhage being considera- ble. On the 18th the entire surface was granulating, and on the 21st she was again discharged. (See two next specimens.) In connection with this case, Dr. H. referred to one that is reported by Dr. Gross in his work on Surgery, Vol. n. p. 534, and one in Mr. Holmes’ System of Surgery, Vol. iv. p. 18. Dr. Hodges also reports that he saw some years ago a very strongly marked case of this disease in a woman who was covered with hair, and exhibited as the “ Bear woman ; ” there being an unusual development of hair in the case reported in Holmes’ Surgery. 1868.

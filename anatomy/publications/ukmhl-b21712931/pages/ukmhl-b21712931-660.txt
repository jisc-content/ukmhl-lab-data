G3 8 MORBID ANATOMY. from a sixth to one-fourth of a drachm. An abscess seemed to be forming in connection with the cyst, and toward the back of the hand. The patient did well. Cast taken by Mr. R. P. Lincoln, one of the house-pupils. 1867. Dr. E. J. Bigeloiv. 2966. A tumor from the groin, that before removal was nearly or quite as large as a henâ€™s egg; hard, defined, not dis- colored, and with an opening at the summit; adherent closely to the skin and surrounding parts. It consisted of an opaque, crumbling substance, with an appearance of cholesterine, but had mostly undergone a calcareous degen- eration, and was surrounded by a cyst of condensed cellu- lar tissue. The patient was seventy years of age, and first noticed the swelling in 1827. In 1837 it suppurated, and remained open from that time. In Nov., 1868, the mass was re- moved, and the man did well, though the operation was followed by an enlargement and suppuration of the ingui- nal glands. (Hospital, 139, 97.) In regard to the nature of the disease, Dr. B. could not say whether it was originally glandular or encysted. 1869. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2967. A congenital tumor, and probably an epithelial cyst, that had become cretaceous from the effects of inflamma- tion. Removed from over the tuberosity of the ischium, of a man thirty years old. About two years before the opera- tion, it became tender, opened, discharged a chalky mat- ter, and then healed; but it enlarged from that time. When seen by Dr. B., it formed a projecting tumor, of the size of a filbert, and rested upon a distinct, flattened base, about an inch in diameter. This last, as well as the tu- mor, proved to consist of a number of lobulated, creta- ceous masses; the material being in some parts hard and brittle, like chalk ; and in others pasty. 1859. Dr. H.

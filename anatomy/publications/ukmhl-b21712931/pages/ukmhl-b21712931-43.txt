HEALTHY ANATOMY. 21 213. A small opening through the sternum, upon the median line, and just below the cartilages of the fourth rib. These last are partially ossified, and the ensiform is largely de- veloped and ossified. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 214. Thorax of a foetus, showing a bifid condition of the ster- num throughout, except, perhaps, at the very upper extrem- ity ; preserved in spirit. From a monstrosity. 1863. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 215-16. Ensiform cartilage of different forms. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 217. An imperfectly developed clavicle, from a little girl, who died of acute disease at the age of eleven years. It is If in. in length, nearly Â£ in. in width, flattened and moder- ately curved. There was the usual attachment to the ster- num, but Dr. C. observed none to the scapula. The other was similarly affected. The father of the child, who was exhibited to the Society for Medical Improvement, by Dr. C., has both clavicles in the same condition; but some- thing like the outer half of these bones was indistinctly felt in connection with the scapula. He stated that two of his brothers had the same malformation ; and he thinks that his father, from the slope of his shoulders, may have had the same. He has had seven boys and two girls ; and all of the boys have had the malformation on one side or both. In regard to strength, and a free use of the upper extremities, he thinks that there is no deficiencjr in any of his family who are thus malformed. 1868. Dr. Ephraim Cutter, of Woburn. 218. Scapulae from an adult male. Acromion process fully de- veloped, but quite distinct from the body of the bone; between which there was in the recent state a synovial cavity, but with little or no motion. The connecting mem- brane was cut through so as to expose the cavity. Bones otherwise fully developed. In one the acromion has been lost. 1854. Dr. B. M. Hodges.

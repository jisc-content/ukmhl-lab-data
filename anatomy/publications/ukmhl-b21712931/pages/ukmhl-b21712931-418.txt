MORBID ANATOMY. 396 1984. Seborrhcea of the face, according to Dr. White; an in- flammation pf the follicles, and pouring out of a fluid that concretes. 1985. S3'Cosis; the region of the beard being affected, as usual. 1986. Favus upon the scalp. Marked “ porrigo. ” 1987. A mouse, affected with favus. The specimen has been examined by Dr. White, who describes- the whole head as nearly concealed by a parasitic, vegetable fungus (achorion Schcenleinii), and which he considered as the cause of the disease; the honey-comb form, color, odor, and mealy consistence being the same as when the disease is seen in the human subject; and the fungus the same, as he showed by the microscope. — Within the last three months twenty other mice, that were killed in the same store, were said to have had the disease, and in some of them it extended to other parts of the body; the cat that killed them being, meanwhile, unaffected.

Skin of the scrotum, dried, and showing numerous, rounded bodies, on an average about as large as a pea, and which, when recent, were evidently cretaceous to a consid- erable extent. Probably a follicular disease. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1990. Thirteen little cretaceous bodies, from the integuments over the front and very lower part of the legs; of a flat- tened and rounded form, yellow color, nearly smooth, and, on an average, about a line in diameter.

MORBID ANATOMY. 649 2993. An “ ear-ring tumor,” about the size of an English wal- nut ; dense and fibrous. From a young adult negress. Disease from the age of four or five years, and attributed to ear-rings that had been put in when she was less than two years old. Troubled her mechanically, and occasionally by an excessive itching. Both ears affected. Removed in April, 1853, Aug. 1859, and 1860, and in March, 1861. Returned each time in about six months after removal. 1861. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 2994. A second specimen, about the size of the above; and another, from the other ear, three times as large; dense, white, rounded, and arose by a small attachment from the lobes. From a negress, about thirty years of age. About three years before Dr. H. excised the tumors, she lent her ear-rings that she wore habitually, to a woman “ who had a humor.” They were worn for two or three hours, returned to the owner in the evening, and at once replaced. In the night she awoke with swelling and intense pain in the ears, and the rings were removed at once. The symptoms, however, continued; and the tumors were soon as large as at the time of their removal. — At the end of five months there was no return of the disease. 1856. Dr. James F. Harlow. For reference to authorities on ear-ring tumors, see Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., Jan., 1861, p. 143. 2995. A life-like, pen-and-ink drawing of a young negro, who came to the hospital as an out-patient to have a tumor removed from the upper edge of tbe external ear. It was about the size of the last joint of the forefinger, and resembled perfectly a common “ ear-ring tumor” externally and internally ; showing that such a tumor may form inde- pendently of the cause that so generally exists. — A case of Dr. Hodges’. 1869. Mr. Wm. P. Bolles, med. student. 2996. A cast, to show the external appearances of a large neuromatous tumor, upon the upper back part of the leg. The patient was a healthy girl, twenty years of age.

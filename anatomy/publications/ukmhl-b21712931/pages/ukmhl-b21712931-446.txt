The lung was considerably inflamed. 1854. Mr. Benj. W. Kinsman, med. student. 2109. Portion of the lung of a porpoise, containing two filariae, about 5 in. in length. Dr. W. has found this parasite very generally in the air- passages of the porpoises that he has examined. 1854. Dr. J. Wyman. Parasites from the lung of a serpent. (See No. 3084.) 2110. The air-passages laid open, and showing a bean*in the cavity, and partially imbedded in the substance of the right primary bronchus ; the walls of this last being soft- ened and deeply eroded, but without the usual signs of in- flammation. A limited portion of the lung was partially hepatized. From a little girl, who was playing with beans, eight da}rs before her death, when she was attacked very sud- denly with urgent dyspnoea, and stretched herself out as she gasped for breath ; but in half an hour she was entirely relieved. After being better and worse for the first three days, she was in such a condition upon the fourth day that it was thought hardly possible for her to live many hours. But as there was pneumonia, and no positive evidence that a bean had been swallowed, the trachea was not opened. For several days the case had been regarded as one of croup. In the evening she became more comfortable, and the symptoms of inflammation afterward subsided. She died, however, very suddenly while sitting up, and appar- ently convalescent. Dr. II. J. Bigelow remarked, upon this case, that it is comparatively safe to leave a hard body; but if, on the other hand, it is one that can swell, the operation should not be delayed. 1863. Dr. G. Ellis.

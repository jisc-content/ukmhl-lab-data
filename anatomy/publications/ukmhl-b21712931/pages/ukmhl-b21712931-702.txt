Portion of the spleen, showing the yellowish masses that are occasionally met with in connection with organic disease of the heart. The patient had frequently had intermittent fever, and died from disease of the heart (No. 1707). The organ weighed 1^ lbs., was generally firm, and some lighter colored portions were particularly so. The opaque, yellowish masses were moderately firm, and sharply defined; one being an inch in diameter, and the other, 2 in. by 1 in. They came quite to the surface, as usual, so as to be at once seen ; and there were some remains of false membrane upon the peritoneal surface, as is so often the case. Microscopically, the masses con- sisted of small granules, about the size of blood-globules. In the preparation the color has much faded.

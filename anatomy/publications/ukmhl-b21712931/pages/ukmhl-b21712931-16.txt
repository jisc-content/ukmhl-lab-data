INTRODUCTION. April 29, 1870. Till though very much less fully than in the other, but with refer- ences and a systematic index. The Museum contains, for its size, many specimens of interest, and some that can hardly be surpassed. But there are a great many deficiencies; and it is to be hoped that many of them will be supplied by the zeal of the young men who are coming forward, and that the profession generally will continue to contribute, as they have heretofore, until there is no common form of injury or disease that will not be repre- sented in the collection. Since the above was in type, a manuscript “ Catalogue of Preparations, belonging to the Anatomical Cabinet of the Massachusetts Medical College,” has been received from Dr. J. Collins Warren, the son of Dr. J. Mason Warren, and grandson of the founder of the Museum. The date of this catalogue, of which I had never before heard, is not given ; but it bears the marks of age, and, if it could have been consulted whilst the present volume was being prepared, it would have been of little use, as very few of the specimens can be identified ; many are certainly not now in the collection, and it gives very generally little more than a mere enumeration of the specimens.

MORBID ANATOMY. 551 The next five specimens were given in 1847, by Dr. J. C. Warren. 2612. Oval. A large gap occurs, which must have been formed in the bladder. Nucleus, ox. of lime, ur. ac., and the urates of lime and ammonia; a black lamina of coagula may have rendered the fracture less difficult. Its exterior and the crack are coated with a deposit of phosph. and caib. of lime, and triple phosph. of ammonia and magne- sia. 2" by V 8m. 2613. Spherical. Nucleus, ox. of lime, with a little ur. ac., and urates of soda and ammonia. This is followed by a less compact deposition of ox. of lime, and urates of am- monia and soda. Exteriorly is a layer of phosph. and carb. of lime. 1" 9'“ by V l111. 2614. Inegular, ovoid. Nucleus compound, and composed of ox. and ur. of lime, ur. of ammonia and ur. ac. About this aie deposited, at first regularly and afterward eccen- trically, ur. of ammonia, ox., carb., and phosph. of lime; the yellow streaks being composed of the ox. and ur 2" 6'" by V 9"'. 2615. Inegulary ovoid, and constricted towards one extremity. Nucleus, ur. ac., urates of ammonia and lime, and ox. of lime. About this is a regular deposit of phosph. and carb. of lime; then a la}rer of ur. ac., urates of ammonia, and lime; and then a large amount of carb. and phosph. of lime, and triple phosphate. Human? 3" 5"1 by 2- 7'" 2616. Oval. Ur. ac., ur. of ammonia, phosph. of lime and triple phosph. The ends are wanting in ur. acid. 1" 10"' by 1" 4"'. 2617. A calculus 1| in. by 1| in., and of a somewhat rounded form. Hard, laminated, and, for the most part, of a reddish- biown color; this portion consisting, according to Dr. White, mainly of uric acid, with a little ur. of ammonia, and a considerable amount of ox. of lime where it borders the external shell. This last consists of the phosph. of lime, and triple ph. of ammonia and magnesia, is £ in. thick at one part, but varies much, and in some places the reddish portion is exposed ; surface broadly grooved.

196 MORBID ANATOMY. length. Extremities rounded, with some new bony de- posit. From a man who entered the hospital (107, 86) March 10th, 1863, just after the accident. Limb shortened 2£ in. Dec. 5 th a seton was passed between the fragments. June 4th, 1864, the bones were drilled, and again July 20th. Nov. 12th Dr. B. did the operation that has already (p. 164) been referred to, and with perfect success. April 26th, 1865, the wire was removed. On the 1st of June the man walked about on crutches ; and on the 12th of July, when he left the hospital, the femur was peifectly film. On the 10th of Nov., when he again showed himself at the hospital, he walked without the aid of a cane, and not the least motion could be detected in the femur. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 325.) The wire is shown with the bones. 1865. Dr. H. J. Bigeloio. 1111. Upper half of the femur, with an abundant earthy peri- osteal deposit, toward the lower extremity. Structure generally light. From a young subject. Probably from a • case of ununited and rather recent fracture. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1112. Fracture just below the middle of the shaft, and strongly united, but with considerable shortening. The central cavity of the fragments, as they overlap, being separated by a coarse cancellated structure, into which the haid walls have become changed. From a male, dissecting-room subject. The limb was very much bowed outward ; and the bone, at the seat of fracture, seemed to be just beneath the skin. Sawed lon- gitudinally, and prepared by Dr. LI. 1857. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1113. Fracture of the femur, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds. Union strong, though the bones have over- shot 22 in.; the upper being inside, and rather in front. 1847> Dr. J. C.

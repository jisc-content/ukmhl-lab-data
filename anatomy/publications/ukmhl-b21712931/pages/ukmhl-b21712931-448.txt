426 MORBID ANATOMY. larynx. This experiment was repeated twice; and after the third and last trial, on regaining the upright position, he coughed out the piece of money, with perfect relief. 1869. Dr. H. K. Oliver. 2113. An irregular piece of bone, about 1 in. by £ in. in diam- eter, that was removed from the larynx. The patient was a man, thirty-five years of age ; and the bone, which is a portion of the lamina of a vertebra, was swallowed at 6 p. m. At 11 p. m. the upper part of the tiachea was opened, and the bone was removed. Thei’e had been a hissing sound with the respiration, but much less distress than would have been expected. The man did well, and was discharged in two weeks ; the wound not ha'' big quite closed, though no air passed through it. (Hospital, 135, 200.) 1868. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2114. A tiacheal tube, removed from the right primary bron- chus ; -j&j in. in diameter, and 2 in. along its convexity. The patient was a man, set. forty-five, who had had the operation of tracheotomy performed three times within eight years, and for the last time in December, 1864. The same tube had been worn since the last operation, and for two months it had not been removed. On the morning of Oct. 26th, 1868, he found that it was detached from the plate that was secured about his neck, and at noon he entered the hospital (135, 201) ; as there was, however, very little irritation, he was left until the next da}'-, when the tube was easily removed with the poly- pus forceps, and on the 31st he was discharged, with a new tube. In connection with this case Dr. II. referred to another, in which the tube simply became unsoldered; and to a third, in which fragments of the tube became detached, and fell down into the air-passages. 1868. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2115. The whole upper right cornu of the thyroid c. broken off, with partial fracture upon the median line. From a Sandwich Islander, who hung himself. 1861. Dr. R. M. Hodges.

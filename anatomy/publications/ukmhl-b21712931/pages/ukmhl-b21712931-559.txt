537 MORBID ANATOMY. Removed from the bladder after death. The patient was an old man, seventy-eight years bf age, who had been under the care of Dr. J. Homans, Sen., and who had great dysuria for a short time, six years before his death. After this subsided he had as good health as most persons of his age, until the last eight months, when the disease returned, so that he was confined to his house; the urine being small in amount, and the character unnatural. The pain, however, was only moderate in amount; and he died at last from a slight cause. The bladder was thickened and contracted about the calculus. 1867. Dr. J. Homans, Jr. The next eleven specimens were given, in 1847, by Dr. J. C. Warren. 2512. A finely marked oval calculus. 2" 2$"' by V 8J'". Nucleus, yellow; uric ac. mostly; with the urates of am- monia and lime. Then a well-defined layer of the same, but different in color; and next a deposit of ur. ac., with very little ur. of ammonia. * The outer portion consists of pure uric acid; and the surface presents a very unusual appearance, as if it had been studded with numerous tuber- cles, and there had been a deposit about these in concentric layers. 2513. Uric acid, and urate of ammonia. V 2111 by V W. Of a spherical form ; and the layers are regularly concentric. Both halves are shown. 2514. Specimen identical in every respect with the two last. 2515. Uric acid and urate of ammonia. 1" T" by V V". Oval; nucleus irregular. 2516. Uric acid, and urate of ammonia; less of the urate in outer layers. Original size, 1" 4'" by 1" 2'". Irregu- larly oval. External surface polished. 251/. Mixed uric acid, and slight amount of urate of ammonia. 2" 8'" by 2" V". Ovoid; exterior, irregular; interior about nucleus corroded and loosely deposited. 2518. Small, irregularly shaped stone. Ur. ac., urates of am- monia and lime. 8"' by 10w. 2519. Compressed, spheroidal concretion of ur. ac., with a little ur. of ammonia and lime. 1" 5'" by 10w.

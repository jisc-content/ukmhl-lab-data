HEALTHY ANATOLIY. 3 The posterior fontanelle is entirely wanting ; and this I believe, as the result of a careful examination of many specimens, is the normal condition of the cranium, and not merely at birth, but during the latter months of pregnancy, though exceptions to the rule are to be met with (see last specimen). The existence of this fontanelle is inferred, when the foetal head is examined, from the yielding of the parietal bones, and the firmness of the occipital; and one is often made when the skull is prepared, if it is not care- fully stuffed.

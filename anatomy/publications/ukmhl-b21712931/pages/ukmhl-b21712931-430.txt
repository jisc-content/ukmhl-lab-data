About eight months before its removal, melanotic tumors, of a rounded, button-shaped form, began to appear; and several of them had been removed by the patient himself, by ligature. The whole was excised by Dr. M., and the wound healed almost at once ; but the man died within a few mouths after the operation. The specimen shows a portion of the skin discolored, but otherwise healthy ; other parts more or less rough from the disease ; and one dark melanotic mass, 1J by 2 in. in diameter, and half an inch thick; the disease being con- fined to the skin. 1858.

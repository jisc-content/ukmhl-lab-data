MORBID ANATOMY. 169 specimen being rounded and smooth, excepting a very small cavity. The patient, a corpulent, flabby woman, ret. forty-five entered the hospital (117, 240) Nov. 10th, 1864; having- had a compound fracture eighteen months before. Seven months after the accident a seton was passed, and left in for a month ; and other means were used ; but the bone never united. The ends of the bone were drawn widely apart by the weight of the forearm, unless held in place by an apparatus that she had worn during the last seven months. On the 19th Dr. B. made an incision upon the outer back part of the arm; the ends of the bone were turned out, the periosteum dissected back from the lower fragment to the extent of about 1| in., and from the upper to that of 2 in., and the ends removed. The bones were so degenerated as to be easily cut with a knife, and the wire was therefore not twisted tightly. The arm beino- very unwieldy, it was placed upon a flat right-angled splint. ° Jan. 7th there was no stiffening, and the wire had appar- ently cut through. On the 1st of April the wire was removed ; on the 26th the arm was amputated, at the request of the patient; and on the 17th of June she left the hospital. (Med. Jour Vol. lxxvi. p. 328.) 1868.

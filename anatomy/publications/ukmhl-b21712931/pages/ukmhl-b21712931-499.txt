MORBID ANATOMY. 477 for two weeks. Daring the first half of his sickness he was confined to his room for three or four days, but with- out any marked symptoms. Then there came on a'severe rigor, followed by colicy pain, and relieved by a discharge from the bowels. The case was particularly characterized by a recurrence of such paroxysms once or twice every twenty-four hours ; the chill lasting about twenty minutes, and being followed by heat, and an active pulse ; the pain lasting for three or four hours ; and each attack being re- lieved by a copious dej. During the intervals he kept his bed, but was quite comfortable, and with a pulse of 65. On the day before his death he was particularly comfort- able, and asked for steak; but, at 4 p.m. a very severe rigor came on, followed by prostration, and he died the next day, at 10 a. in. On examination, a general peritonitis was found, espe- cially in the right iliac fossa; and in the appendix three or four masses of old faecal matter, with some mixture of the triple phosphate. The case, which occurred in the practice of Dr. Ezra Palmer, was further remarkable for the absence of nausea, vomiting, and constipation. (See No. 2331.) 1867. Dr. J. Homans.

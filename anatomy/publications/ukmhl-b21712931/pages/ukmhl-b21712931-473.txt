MORBID ANATOMY. 451 cicatrization. The situation of the ulcer was in the small curvature, and toward the pylorus. From a woman, set. twenty-six }'ears, who died at the hospital (89, 144) of disease of the breast, with pleural effusion. She had had vomiting for four months, and it was urgent toward the last, with great distress, and a gnaw- ing sensation at the stomach rather than pain ; there was also much thirst, which she freely indulged. 1860. Dr. C. Dllis. 2199. A defined ulcer, about 1ยฃ in. by ยง in. in diameter; and from the base there projects the open orifice of a vessel. From an intemperate man, who entered the hospital (277, 68) with albuminuria, and had been subject to jaun- dice and constipation. Not long afterward vomiting of clotted blood came on to the amount of one or two pints; and two days afterward, when it recurred, he died. 1868. Dr. G. C. Shattuck. 2200.

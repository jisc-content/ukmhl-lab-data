439 MOEBID ANATOMY. diaphragmatic and lower part of the costal pleura, where they were almost continuous. Among these were a few small, whitish, semi-gelatinous, pediculated growths, and entirely different from the above. There was no disease of the kind in the other pleural cavity ; but in both lungs were soft, whitish, encephaloid masses, and the same was found in the bronchial glands, and in the liver. Micro- scopically, there were found elongated cells, and many of them were quite long ; in these were elongated nuclei, some with distinct and large, but more with indistinct nucleoli. All were more or less granular. A few large, round or oval bodies were seen ; probably free nuclei, and some con- tained -well-marked nucleoli. The tumor upon the thigh showed cells that contained many granules, or minute glob- ules, and which were evidently degenerating, though to the naked eye the color did not indicate it. There were also a few large and well-developed nuclei and nucleoli; and in the tumors removed during life there was a marked differ- ence of appearance in different portions. 1859. Dr. C.

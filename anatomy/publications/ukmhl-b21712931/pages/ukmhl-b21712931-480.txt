458 MORBID ANATOMY. the disease of the mucous membrane, the ulceration, and especially the thickening, etc., of the muscular coat are finely shown. Lymphatic glands enlarged. The other or- gans were healthy. From a woman, set. fifty, who had been sick more than two years. Dyspepsia and occasional vomiting, with loss of flesh and strength. Vomited grumous matter six or eight weeks before death. Tumor in the epigastrium, towards the left side, with tenderness. 1862. Dr. John C. Dalton, Sen. In cancerous disease of the pyloric portion of the stom- ach, I have always found the tumor, when there was one, upon the median line, or upon the left side, but never upon the right, where we should expect to find it. 2213. Cancer of the pyloric portion. The entire circumfer- ence is not involved ; but, in the midst of the disease, the parietes are perfectly health}’’, and in the form of a narrow strip, connecting the stomach and duodenum. From a lady, set. sixty-one, who had been dyspeptic for years, but without severe pain until the last ten days, when it was of a darting character. Two weeks before death there was soreness at the epigastrium, with frequent vomit- ing of coffee-ground matter. 1862. Dr. D. H. Storer. The preservation of a portion of healthy tissue between the stomach and duodenum, and sometimes when the dis- ease was extensive, has been observed here in other cases, and seems as if it may be a provision of nature to aid the stomach in the performance, however imperfect, of its functions. 2214. The whole organ preserved. It is very much contracted, much thickened, and seems to be scirrhous, if not quite universally ; as in a figure of Cruveilhier’s. (Anat. Path, liv. xxvii.) 1866. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2215. Extensive ulceration, from malignant disease, of the py- • loric portion of the stomach, but without the microscopic appearances of cancer. From a man, set. forty-four, who had had gastric symp- toms for about fourteen months. (Hospital, 229, 10.)

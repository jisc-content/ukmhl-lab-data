MOKBID ANATOMY. 663 In September, 1863, the disease returned ; and in Febru- ary, 1864, when he re-entered the hospital, there was one tumor, of the size of an egg, and another smaller one. On the 27th these were removed, and were found to extend to the mucous membrane of the fauces. Sloughing and hemorrhage followed, and on the 7th of March he died. On dissection, the organs were found healthy. The tumor was found by Dr. Ellis to consist, microscopically, of closely aggregated cells; irregular, as if shrivelled, and without distinct nuclei or other marked characteristics. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3030. Cast of the above tumor. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3031. Daguerreotype of a large, mixed, cartilaginous tumor, upon the side of the neck, and of eight or ten years’ dura- tion.

Daguerreotype of the above patient, after recovery. 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3033. A myeloid tumor, removed by Dr. T. It was situated in front of the ankle-joint, and appeared like an enlarged bursa, though painful; firm, rounded, elastic, and about 2 in. in diameter. — The patient was a woman, fifty-five years of age, and had had the disease for several years. (Hospital, 78, 197.) The tumor was of a dark-reddish color, slightly vascular, rather soft, and. bound down by fibrous bands. On section, it seemed to consist of three or four lobules ; structure compact; surface smooth; generally of a dull, light brownish-red color, but with numerous small spots of a bright orange-red. Upon the external surface this last color was more extensive. Microscopical examination by Dr. Ellis. 1859. Dr. S. D. Townsend. Myeloid disease of tibia. (See No. 1485.) 3034.

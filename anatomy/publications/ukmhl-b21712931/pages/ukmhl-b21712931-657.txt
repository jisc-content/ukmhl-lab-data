MORBID ANATOMY. 635 form, 1 in. in diameter, and f in. thick. At the operation, it was found to be almost wholly contained in a cavity that it had formed for itself in the substance of the parie- tal bone; the edges of the cavity being sharp, and the depth more than \ in. The aperture allowed but a small portion of the tumor to project above the surface of the surrounding bone ; and this portion alone was felt before the operation. The bottom of the cavity was formed by the internal table of the parietal bone, and was so thin as to spring under pressure. The patient was a young man, oet. twenty-six, and re- ported. the tumor as of three months’ duration; but Dr. H. thought it in all probability congenital, and that the depression in the parietal bone was analogous to the de- pression that is sometimes seen in congenital, circumorbital, encysted tumors. (Hospital, 122, 58.) 1865. Dr. R. M. Hoclges. 2954. A cast, to show the depression in the parietal bone in the above case. 1805. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2955. A cyst, from the head, about as large as a hen’s egg; inverted and stuffed. Inner surface generally quite smooth ; but at one part there is skin, with black hairs growing from it. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. 2956. Balls of fatty matter, from a cyst upon the top of the head (Hospital, 51, 188) ; of a yellowish-white color, soft, cheesy consistence, and averaging 2 or 3 lines in di- ameter. For a daguerreotype of the patient, cast of the tumor and cyst itself, see Nos. 1240, etc., in the Med. Soc.’s Museum. 1852. Dr. Samuel Parlcman. 2957. A cyst, removed from over the sternum, and perhaps congenital. From a man, forty-five years of age. The inner surface is cuticular, with hairs growing from it; and the cavity was filled, when recent, with balls of fat, 3 or 4 lines in diameter, intermixed with epithelial scales and loose hairs ; the resemblance to the last case being very striking. 1852. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 2958. Hair from the above cyst. 1852. Dr. S. D. Townsend.

The patient was a married woman, set. thirty-four years, and had had frequent and painful micturition for about four months; she was constantly getting worse, and the urine was toward the last ropy and offensive.

It is of an irregularly triangular form, about in. by f in. in its largest diameters, and con- sists of the triple phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, carb. of lime, and ur. of ammonia. With it was a second calculus, about the size of a pea, and of a flattened form; and, the bladder Jiaving been fully explored by the finger, no others were found.

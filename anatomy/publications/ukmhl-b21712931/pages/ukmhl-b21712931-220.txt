MORBID ANATOMY. 198 between the living and the dead bone. A considerable quantity of new and .soft bone connects this upper frag- ment with the shaft above the inner condyle. From an intemperate man, oet. thirty-seven years, who slipped and fell with the whole weight of his body upon this limb. On entrance into the hospital (28, 331) Dec. 20th, 1844, there was a shortening of 2 or 3 in., consider- able swelling and emphysema about the knee, and a pro- trusion of the upper fragment nearly an inch, with great pain, and considerable bleeding. The fracture was re- duced, but the bones could hardly be kept in place; and on the third “day, the extension being discontinued, on account of the pain and swelling, the limb was simply laid in a fracture box. Suppuration and sloughing followed. Feb. 5th the limb was much shortened, and the upper frag- ment seemed to have penetrated the knee-joint beneath the patella. On the 11th of March it protruded below this bone, and on the 11th of April the man died. 1847. Dr. J. 0. Warren. 1119. A portion of the femur, 2 in. in length, and evidently separated from one of the fragments in a case of compound fracture ; being a completion of the process that was going on in the last case. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1120. A portion of femur, more than an inch in length, and probablv sawed off in a case of compound fracture ; theie being no appearance of necrosis, nor of its having been previously amputated. The canal is closed by a deposit of new bone. 1847. Dr. J. C. Wairen. • 1121. Recent oblique fracture of the lower third of the shaft. Lower fragment much comminuted, and looks as if the individual may have been run over by a loaded wagon. 1856 Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1122. The lower portion of the femur, showing an extensive breaking down of its surface, in and near the popliteal re- o-ion, with flattened shot sticking in the bone. From a young man,' ait. eighteen, who accidentally re- ceived a charge of shot from a fowling-piece. Dr. B. found

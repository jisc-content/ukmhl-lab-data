Calculus removed by the lateral operation ; of a flattened, oval form ; f in. by | in.; earthy appearance y surface rough, with some small, shining crystals. Consists chiefly, according to Dr. Bacon, of the triple phosph. and phosph. of lime, with some ur. ac. and urates. The crystals upon the exterior are the triple phosph. From a mechanic, of this city, set. fifty-one, who had severe urinary symptoms, and had had them, more or less, as long as he could remember. In 1858 a large calculus was lemoved. Oct. 25th, 1859, another stone was felt by Di. B., and on the 25th of Feb. the operation was per- foimed. The calculus broke, and the specimen here shown foimed the nucleus ; about a teaspoonful of fragments be- ing also scooped out. The patient finally did well. (Hos- pital, 87, 6.) 1860. Dr. II. J.

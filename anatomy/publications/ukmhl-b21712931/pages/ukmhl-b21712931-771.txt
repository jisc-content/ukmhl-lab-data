After section "of the lower part of the cornea, an attempt was made to grasp the lens ; but it slipped into the poste- rior chamber, and disappeared in the softened vitreous humor, rendering it necessary to search for it with a curette. Upon removal, it was found completely cretaceous, and diminished in size about one-third. After the operation the incision in the cornea closed at once, and without any increased opacity ; the globe retained its size, notwithstanding a discharge of some of the vit- reous humor, and the girl went home in a few days. The contrast between this cretaceous transformation, to which the lens is liable, and a true bony growth that may form in the bottom of the globe, as shown in No. 2046, is very striking. 1870. Dr. H.

The patient was a feeble man, sixty years of age, and entered the hospital Dec. 2d, 1866 (127, 222). When a boy, and without known cause, there came on a swelling over both tibiae, followed by abscesses, and there had been a discharge ever since, with an occasional discharge of small pieces of bone. For the last five years he had done no work, as his health failed. One year before admission the skin over the right leg became red and tense ; an ulcer soon formed, and in a few months there sprang up from its surface an exuberant and rapidly increasing growth. When seen, it had a spongy and vascular look, and was elevated 1^ in. — overlapping the base, and measuring in extent 6 by 3 in. The limb was amputated by Dr. H. below the knee Dec. 8th ; and the patient, sinking from inflammation of the stump, and increased trouble in the other leg, died Jan. 10th. The outgrowth, which was not regarded as malignant,

303 MORBID ANATOMY. rounding parts, being quite healthy, have been removed. The structure is mainly osseous, light, brittle, and fibrous ; many parts externally suggesting the idea of some kind of coral or of sponge; some of the spiculae being very delicate. Nowhere foliated, compact, nor at all pulverulent. The fleshy portion of the tumor consisted of a white, dense, fibrous tissue. The two bones were firmly connected by the morbid growth ; the outline of the ulna being through- out sufficiently distinct; and the very lower extremity quite healthy. The radius, in which the disease seems to have commenced, is traceable to a considerable extent, but be- low this it is quite lost in the tumor; the bones not being enlarged so far as they are traced, and their cavities being obliterated so far as the tumor extends. In the present dried specimen a large section has been made near the sur- face, to show the structure, and some fragments are seen that were detached by maceration. A piece is also seen of the size of a large nutmeg, but of a flattened, oval form, and that in the recent state was entirely distinct from the main tumor, though in close apposition with it; this piece being movable as a distinct mass, before the amputation. From a healthy young lady, twenty-four years of age. In 1857 she sprained her wrist. Six or eight weeks after- ward a tumor appeared on the radius, and slowly increased ; and subsequently others on the ulna. In 1860-1 portions were removed at three different times. In April, â€™62, when she entered the hospital (101, 174), the tumor was 12 in. in circumference, having doubled in size the previous year ; regarded beyond question as enchondroma, from its some- what knobbed form and densely elastic feel. The limb was amputated 4 in. below the elbow, on the 12th, and she wras discharged May 12th. At the end of a year or more there was no return of the disease. 1863. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 1524.

522 MORBID ANATOMY. 2465. A kidney, ulcerated, but rather less extensively than No. 2467 ; and containing, within it, an irregular white calculus. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2466. The left kidney, reduced to a dense mass of fibrous and adipose tissue, so that its outlines are only faintty trace- able. In the remains of its cavity is a compact, yellowish white calculus, an inch or more in length, and about I in. in diameter; and, connected with this, undoubtedly, though the connection was not fully traced, is a fistula that opened upon the surface of the body. From a woman, set. forty-five years, who fell down stairs thirteen years before her death, and had pain in her side from that time. Three years before death the pain increased ; an abscess formed between the last rib and the ilium, was opened, and a fistula ever afterward remained.

Ellis. 2467. Kidney very extensively destroyed by chronic ulceration. • 1847. ♦ Dr. J. C. Warren. 2468. A kidney, from a gentleman who had suffered severely from urinary symptoms.

A yellowish, mottled appearance, and degeneration throughout the organ. 2471. Another form of this granular disease of the kidney. 2472. Atrophy, with structural disease. 2473. Bright’s disease. There was an albuminous-looking de- posit throughout the cortical substance, that is still well marked.

The heart was much diseased j

MORBID ANATOMY. 536 The following ten specimens were given, in 1800, by Dr. John Nichols. 2501. Uric acid. &" by T" ("' lines, and " inches). Irregular concretion. 2502. Uric acid. T" by 4'". External surface dark red. 2503. Uric acid. 8'" by Q"'. Compressed, oval. External surface granular. 2504. Uric acid. 8'" by 5'". Shape, peculiar. Originally oval, but changed subsequently by formation of a broad groove, which is deeper at one end. Centre made up by agglomer- ation of particles. Dr. White remarks upon the eroded appearance in sev- eral of the specimens from the two collections that he ex- amined, and that is, “ without doubt, owing to chemical action, induced by injections within the bladder.” 2505. Uric acid. 7by 6"'. Pale, globular, and resembling dried putty, externally. 2506. Irregularly loose compact mass of uric acid, and formed about an oblong, darker nucleus of the same. No regular stratification. 1" 3'" b}r ll'". 2507. Uric acid. l"3///byl". Smooth; oval; light-fawn color ; concentric layers. 2508. Uric acid wholly. 1" 9"' by 1" 2"'. Oblong. Concen- tric.; — much cracked, and probably after formation of external layers. Exterior, pale brown ; worn, granular appearance. Original length above given. 2509. Uric acid. 1" 2"' by 1". Two halves preserved. Smooth ; finely laminated ; globular form, with two coty- loid cavities, caused probably by the presence of other calculi in the bladder, and giving the surface a fan-shaped form. 2510. Uric acid. 2" by 1" 5'". Long; oval. Nucleus dark pink ; exterior layers pale fawn color. 2511. A smooth, compact calculus, If in. in length, 1^ in. in diameter, and having the peculiar form of two blunt cones, united by their base. On loug. section, it has the charac- teristic reddish color and concentric arrangement through- out ; and, on examination by Dr. White, is found to con- sist of uric acid, with a little urate of ammonia.

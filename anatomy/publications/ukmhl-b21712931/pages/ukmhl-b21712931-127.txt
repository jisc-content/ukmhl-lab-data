The bladder was formed in two cavities, that communicated freely near the neck; and one of them communicated almost throughout with the rectum ; this last opening near the line of the integument.

Upon each side, and at some dis- tance apart, was one-half of a uterus, with its tube, and one-half of a vagina, perfectly symmetrical; cut open upon one side, and shows the os tine®. Ovaries not found ; trace of external labia ; pubic bones widely separ- ated, as in extroversion of the bladder. Thoracic organs well.

MORBID ANATOMY. 287 for Montreal, and died in the cars. Dr. Ellis found the microscopic appearances of myeloid disease; but unfortu- nately no record was made of the gross appearances of the interior. The head and upper part of the bone are distended into a large, rounded cavity, the parietes of which are gener- ally thin, and in some parts destroyed. Inner surface rough and somewhat reticulated. The articular surface looks healthy, and the tibia below the tumor is perfectly so ; the limits being remarkably defined. In the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet is a perfectly similar speci- men (No. 1282), in which the gross appearances of the interior were highly characteristic of myeloid disease, but no microscopic examination was made. The ischium is the bone affected. See Mr. Gray’s paper on Myeloid Tumors of Bone, with figures of the microscopical appearances, in the Med. Chir. Trans. Vol. xxxix. p. 121. 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. I486. A model in plaster, of the femur, from a case of gelatin- iforrn disease of the bone. I rom a man, twenty-two years of age. In April he had in- flammation about the left knee, and abscesses soon followed • gelatinous masses, of a reddish color, frequently escaping . with the pus. He sank from pain and suppuration ; and the limb was amputated in July. The stump did well, but he died with purpura, etc., in about seven weeks. The periosteum around the lower half of the femur was thickened and granulated with the gelatiniform substance; and, where the tissues were most diseased, the thickness amounted to an inch and a half. Just above the condyles, posteriorly, the femur was largely perforated, as seen in the model; and the substance of the bone was found to be died with the soft gelatiniform material. The knee-joint was healthy. 1858. Dr. Alfred Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 1487 Knee-joint; in spirit. The upper extremity of the tibia, o t e extent of 3 in., is entirely destroyed; terminating m a rough, thin edge, and its place being occupied by a

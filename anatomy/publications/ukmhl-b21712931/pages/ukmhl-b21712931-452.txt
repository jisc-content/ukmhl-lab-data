MORBID ANATOMY. 430 2133. Deep ulceration, with tubercular deposit, in the anterior, upper part of the trachea; the mucous membrane beino- otherwise healthy. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. * 2134. Larynx, with a small portion of the trachea, showing * very numerous, defined, and small ulcers scattered over the whole surface. And the same were found throughout the trachea and into the primary bronchi. From a young man, set. seventeen years, who died of phthisis at the hospital (204, 246). 1856. Dr. 0. Ellis. 2135. Thibertâ€™s model. Glanders in man. Pustules and ulcera- tions upon the under surface of the epiglottis. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2136. Extensive ulceration of the larynx, and probably of syphilitic character. From a man, set. thirty-eight, who had been under the care of Dr. J. for five years before his death, and had been treated for the same disease for one year previously. There was extensive ulceration of the nostrils, with occa- sional discharges of bone, and a falling in of the septum ; and every portion of the throat was successively attacked; the velum, uvula, and tonsils becoming curiousty joined together by cicatrized bands. The voice was husky, and there was considerable pain, with dysphagia. The disease would be apparently arrested for some months, but would reappear upon the suspension of treatment. During the last year he had severe cough, with loss of flesh and appe- tite ; and died finally from acute pneumonia. The inner surface of the pharynx looked as if cicatrized after a burn. Upon the edge of the epiglottis, and as low down as the vocal cords, are little, smooth, rounded nod- ules ; with an appearance of cicatrization between them. The cords themselves are ulcerated ; and the lower portion of the larynx is nearly surrounded by a ragged, burrowing ulcer, the surface of which was covered with pus. Below this the mucous membrane was sufficiently healthy. 1856. Dr. J. S. Jones. 2137. A warty-looking growth from about the ventricle of the

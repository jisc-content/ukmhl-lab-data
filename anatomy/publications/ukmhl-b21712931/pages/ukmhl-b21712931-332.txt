310 MORBID ANATOMY. millimeters in breadth, extending nearly to the nasals. The sagittal suture is completely obliterated in the middle portion, for the space of nearly an inch; for the rest of its extent it is open, the two parietals approaching each other quite closely ; in the fore part the edges are smooth and straight, and in the hinder somewhat serrated, but do not touch. The frontals are very protuberant, and on the inside of each, corresponding very nearly with the frontal eminences, are two marked depressions, causing the bone to appear diaphanous in some parts ; but, in others, extend- ing quite through ; each of these is surrounded by a ridge of dense bone, quite unusual in a foetal cranium. These deformities may be compared to the digital impressions of the adult crania.‚Äù 1867. 1554. A fourth skull; deformed, but less so than the above. 1555. A fifth ; cast in plaster. 1556. A sixth; elongated and depressed ; cast in plaster. 1557. A seventh; from Paris. Very remarkable distortion pos- teriorly ; the left side being protuberant. 1558. An eighth ; a Cretin, from the Haut-valais. Low ; large posteriorly, and bulging upon each side of the median line just behind the vertex. 1559.

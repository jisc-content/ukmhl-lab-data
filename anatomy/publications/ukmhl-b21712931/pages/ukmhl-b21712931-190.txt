168 MORBID ANATOMY. the lower fragment was reddish, dense, brittle, and amor- phous, as it is sometimes in the denuded walls of the cavity of sequestra; and that, at the end of about a year, and when dead bone could no longer be felt, the tissue was comparatively healthy, and the interior cancellated. The arm was seven inches shorter than its fellow. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 332.) The bones that were removed at the two first operations are shown ; with one of the wires. 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1009. A fifth case. The patient, aet. thirty-three, was wounded with a conical ball, at the battle of Gettysburg, July 3d 1863, and the result was a compound and comminuted fracture of the humerus. July 5th about 3 in. of the bone were removed, but the bones were not kept in apposition, and no union followed. In five months the wound healed, and never troubled him afterward; and, having resumed duty, he served out his full time with his resriment. On admission into the hospital, Jan. 26th, 1866 (125, 116), the extremities of the bone were felt, pointed and considerably absorbed; and the arm hung atrophied and useless. On the 27th the operation was performed for Dr. B. by Dr. Hodges, 1 in. being removed from one of the fragments, and 1J in. from the other; the bones, as seen in the preparation, being much atrophied. The ends were then drilled, and a silver wire was passed and twisted, allowing room for slight movement. The periosteum was returned to its place; the wound closed and dressed ; and an internal angular splint applied. Abscesses formed after the operation; but on the 31st of March the union was firm, and he left the hospital. May 23d he returned to have the wire removed ; and on the 30th of April, 1867, he wrote to say that his arm was strong, and that for months he had used it daily. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 331.) 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1010. A sixth case. The lower 2Â£ in. of the humerus, from a case of ununited fracture; the upper extremity of the

About six weeks after the original in- jury, the bladder was injected with warm water, and the catheter removed by means of a lithotrite, there being a considerable deposit of the salts of the urine upon it. 1868. Dr. II. G. Clark. * IV. Calculi. One hundred and twenty-three of the following speci- mens were sent to Harvard University, from England, in the year 1800, by Dr. John Nichols ; and, as the Medical School then existed, and they were undoubtedly intended for its use, they will be entered as a donation to the Muse- um. Not man)'- years ago they were removed from Cam- bridge to the Medical College. In 1856 they were exam- ined by Dr. James C. White ; and the results were given in a tabular form, with some remarks, in the Med. Jour. (Vol. liv. p. 459). Since then one of the specimens has unfortunately been lost. Forty-eight other specimens were already in the Muse- um when it was presented to the College by Dr. J. C. War- ren ; and these were analyzed by Dr. White, in 1858, and the results published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lix. p. 329), in tabular form, and with extended remarks upon the for- mation of calculi. In both cases Dr. W. used the micro- scope, as being much more exact than the test tube. In the Nichols collection he says: “In each case the entire smface of a section through the centre has been carefully and equally scraped ; by which means we not only obtain all the constituent parts, but their relative proportions also. In the Warren collection he says: “ In every in- stance the nucleus and each layer have been separately examined, etc. In his second article Dr. White gives the following tables, — the four first in reference to Dr. War- len s collection, and the two last to show the result of the analysis of both collections :

46 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 440. A colored lithograph of a negro idiot; a young adult. His stunted condition (3 ft.), healthy appearance, hap- py expression, and frequent protrusion of the tongue from his half-open mouth were perfectly characteristic. When he closed his mouth the incisor teeth did not meet, but left an elliptical opening, as in the Chimpanzee ; the elbow and knee-joints could not be fully extended, and the calves are seen in the figure to be quite small. His head, which was formed as usual in such cases, and was one of the smallest, seemed to be kept shaved ; and measured, antero-posty. 4£ in., in circumference 14£ in., between the orifices of the ears 3£ in., and from the chin to the vertex 6£ in. The attendant stated that he never made any articulate sounds ; that he had to be attended to every two or three hours for his excretions; that he had hair upon the pubes, and an occasional erection, but he had never known him to have an emission, nor to show any tendency to masturbation. 1862.

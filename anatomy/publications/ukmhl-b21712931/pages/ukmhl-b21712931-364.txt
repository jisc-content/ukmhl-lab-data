Two of the aortal valves so completely fused as to form one continuous cavity, excepting some remains within of a septum. This last may, after a time, have disappeared by atrophy, and the case would then have been one of a two- valved aorta. The third is quite distinct, and they are all thickened. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1724. Very great disease of the aortal valves. .Many yellow vegetations upon them, one or two lines in diameter; and one large group projects from the free edge. One third or more of one of the valves is so far destroyed that the lining membrane of the heart is continuous with that of the aorta, and quite smooth, excepting a few very small vegetations. The heart weighed 15£ oz. From a woman, set. forty-seven, who died of pulmonary disease. (Hospital, 212, 29.) 1861. Dr. C. Ellis. 1725. A heart which, when recent, weighed between 2^ and 2£ • lbs.

4 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 35. A fourth, about six years old. 1853. Dr. W. N. Lane, of Charlestown. 36. A fifth ; age about seven or eight years. 1861. Dr. E. M. Hodges. 37. Portion of the skull of an idiot, fourteen years of age. The frontal and sphenoidal sinuses, and the antrum are largely developed. In connection with this case, Dr. H. referred to the re- marks of Mr. Hilton (Guy’s Hosp. Repts. Yol. viii. Part II. p. 362), that “the frontal sinuses do not make their appearance until fourteen or fifteen years of age, or even in many instances at a still later period.” “ The antrum and the sphenoidal cells, like the frontal sinuses, remain undeveloped during early life.” 1856. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 38-41. Four foetal temporal bones, of different ages, and four sphenoid bones from the same subjects, to show the devel- opment. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 42-5. Lower maxillary bones, from subjects of different ages. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 46. Second vertebra, from a foetus at the term, to show the body and odontoid process. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 47. First, second, and seventh cervical vertebrae, from the same subject as No. 33. In the first there is no appearance of ossification of the bod}’’, and in the seventh there was none in the costal portion of the transverse process. 1861. 48. The two first vertebrae of a calf, five or six weeks old, and showing that the first has a body, and the second an odontoid process ; this last being fully formed, though yet separate. The odontoid is regarded by some anatomists as the body of the first vertebra. 1866. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson.

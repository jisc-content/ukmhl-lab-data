340 MORBID ANATOMY. 1708. The tricuspid valve, which alone is preserved, looks as if it had been torn across and afterward firmly cicatrized, except at one point; the rest of the valve being sufficiently healthy. The heart was thickened and dilated ; the aortal valves almost quite health}^ but the mitral very greatly diseased. From a man, ret. twenty-eight- j'-ears. Disease of eight years’ duration; and symptoms urgent the last twenty months. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxx. p. 182.) 1864. Dr. C. Ellis. 1709. A “bovine” heart injected, with the vessels about it. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. Thibert’s models. 1847. Dr. G. Hayward. 1710. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle, with old pericarditis. 1711. Second. — “Concentric hypertrophy” of the left ven- tricle ; transverse section. 1712. Third. — Another section of the same. 1713. A heart preserved entire, that weighed nearly 2^ lbs., • and that was generally enlarged, but without valvular dis- ease. From a man, set. seventy, who had symptoms of organic disease of the heart, but no souffle; also Bright’s disease, with oedema, ascites, and hydrothorax. A patient of Dr. John Ware. 1860. Dr. J. Homans. 1714. A second specimen. The left ventricle is very much di- • lated, but the valves are healfhy. Foramen ovale, —valvu- lar opening. Eustachian valve strongly marked. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1715. A third. Left ventricle is much dilated, but not at all thickened. Morbid, soft growths are seen upon the aortal valves, but the orifice is sufficiently large. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1716. A fourth. Weight of heart 17£ oz. Mitral and aortal • valves much ossified, with old fibrinous clots on the last; but the mitral orifice is not contracted ; left ventricle thickened. From a man, aet. fifty, who died at the hospital (231, 50) of rheumatism, and with rather slight cardiac symp- toms. 1860.

639 MORBID ANATOMY. * size of a walnut, rather soft, though not fluctuating, and not discolored nor adhei’ent. The patient was a healthy boy, sixteen years of age, and the disease was of about a year’s duration, though it had been stationary the last six months. Never tender until the last month, when the skin ulcerated, and a gush of blood followed. After removal, the mass appeared light-colored, dryish, friable, and curiously granular; particles rolling off be- neath the finger, and feeling calcareous. No calcareous mat- ter, however, was found microscopically, but partially de- veloped epithelial cells distributed uniformly throughout the mass. This last was perfectly homogeneous on section, though in certain directions it could be torn in non-con- centric laminae. There was no marked cyst about it, and the surrounding tissues were healthy.

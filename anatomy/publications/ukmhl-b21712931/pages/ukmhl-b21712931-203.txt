181 MOKBID ANATOMY. 1057. A recent fracture of the neck, almost close to the margin of the head posteriorly, and half an inch or less below it anteriorly. The shell of the neck was driven into the head half an inch posteriorly, and the head is bent upon the neck so as to open the line of fracture in front nearly one- fourth of an inch. The central portion of the head of the bone was also driven three-fourths of an inch into the less compact, cancellated structure of the neck ; and altogether the impaction was such that considerable force was required to separate the fragments; these last being now perma- nently fixed in *the position in which they were before the separation, and with some eversion. From a woman, set. seventy-six, who fell upon the right trochanter, and two days afterwards entered the hospital (107, 84) under the care of Dr. Gr. There was eversion of the limb, with shortening of half an inch; and the pa- tient, who regarded the injury as nothing more than a se- vere bruise, died in two weeks of pneumonia. Dr. Bigelow thinks it fair to suppose that bony union would have occurred if the woman had lived. See No. 1115. 1869. Dr. Geo. H. Gay. 1058-61. Effects of conical balls, as shown upon the dead body ; • upon the neck of the femur, upon the condyles, and upon the ankle ; and, by contrast, the effect of a common round ball above the condyles. In spirit. See Med. Jour. Vol. lxix. p. 357. 1861. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1062. Fracture, confined to the neck of the right femur. Bones macerated, and show very little change. From a feeble, old woman, seventy-six years of age, who fell as she was walking across her room, and struck the right hip. Lived ten weeks. Eversion and slight shorten- ing of limb ; much pain when thigh was flexed on pelvis ; no crepitus before nor after death. 1860. Dr. Francis Minot. For Dr. Bigelow’s anatomical description of the upper extremity of the femur, in relation to fractures, see No. 111.

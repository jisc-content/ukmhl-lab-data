HEALTIIY ANATOMY. 11 chanteric line, by means of the posterior wall of the neck, which is wedged beneath them. “The impaction here described, is, doubtless, a very fre- quent accident; not uncommonly resulting in complete union at the end of a few months, more frequently occur- ring than the fracture within the capsule, and by no means so grave a lesion as certain authors have considered it. In fact, its only indications, in some cases, are persistent local pain, attended with a veiy slight shortening, and ro- tation outwards of the limb, and of course, without crepitus. “ An additional and important remark should be here made, in relation to the shortening of the limb, which rarely results, in these cases, from the separation of the fragments, but only from the obliquity of the anterior hinge. In illustrating this, it will be seen that, if this hinge were vertical, the neck, thus hinged upon the shaft, would merely rotate around the axis of the shaft, and there would be no shortening ; but, as the hinge is placed at an angle of 45°, the neck rotates not only backwards, but downwards; or, which is the same thing, the shaft ascends, and the whole bone is shortened.” Dr. H.

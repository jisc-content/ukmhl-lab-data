The next thirty specimens were given in 1800, by Dr. J. Nichols. 2562. Uric acid, urate of ammonia, and ox. of lime in slight proportion; 1" 8"' by 1" 4'". Ovoid. Exterior slightly tuberculated, and upon each surface two longitudinal de- pressions separated by a ridge. Cortex porous and light. Nucleus of a purplish-brown color, and compact. Both halves. 2563. Nucleus of ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia. Outer layers of oxalate of lime ; regular, well-marked, compact. 1" by T". Shape, irregular; surface, smooth ; color, pale. 2564. Nucleus of ur. of ammonia; ur. ac. slight. Outer lay- ers, ox. of lime. Large tubercles on exterior. Deep fawn color. Shape, irregular. Size, 10'". 2565. Very rough, spherical, mulberry calculus. Nucleus irreg- ular in shape; ur. of ammonia, and a little ur. ac., suc- ceeded by ox. of lime. Interstices between the ray-like laminae filled with the urate. 1" 3'" by 1" V". 2566. Dark, round, mulberry stone. Nucleus, ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia. Exterior, ox. of lime. Much organic mat- ter, consisting of dried blood, epithelium, etc., between nucleus and the oxalate. V 2'" in diameter. 2567. Irregularly shaped, botryoidal calculus. Nucleus ur., ac. and ur. of ammonia; and the same is interspersed amidst the very irregularly deposited layers of oxalate of lime, which form nearly the whole of the exterior. 1" &" by 1" 4c'". 2568. Spherical calculus, made up of alternate layers of ox. of lime and ur. ac., with ur. of ammonia. Nucleus com- posed of the last two substances. Exterior covered with a distinct coating of large crystalline concretions of ox. of lime, coral-like in aspect. 1" S’" in diameter. 2569. Large, pale calculus, of a long oval shape. Nucleus ; ur. ac., much ur. of lime, and a little ur. of ammonia. Outer part made up of ur. ac., much ur. of lime, and a little ur.

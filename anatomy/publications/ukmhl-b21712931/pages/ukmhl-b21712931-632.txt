MORBID ANATOMY. 610 II. Testicle. 2838. Thibert’s model. Hydrocele. 1847. Dr. G. Hayward. 2839. Cavity shown, extending to the groin. 1847. Dr. G. Hayward. 2840. Old hydrocele, about the size of an orange. Not cut • open. 1847. Dr. 1 Vat ten. 2841. The same, about as large as the last. Cut open to show the testis, and great thickening of the sac. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2842. A third specimen. —The tunica vaginalis is nearly l in. thick, and in the cavity was a pint of a dirty-colored fluid ; the fluid of the hydrocele being probably mixed with effused blood. The inner surface was lined in part with lymph. The disease was of nineteen years’ duration, and the mass was removed as being an enlarged testicle. It was as large as a cocoa-nut, firm, and without fluctuation, but showing an inflamed spot upon its anterior face. The testicle is seen upon the back part of the sac, apparently atrophied and adherent. The other testicle had been enlarged during the last year, but without hydrocele. The patient did well. 1849. Dr. J. M. Warren. 2843. Old adhesions of the tunica vaginalis. Testicle not enlarged. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2844. A round, fleshy body, about as large as a garden pea, and that was attached to the testicle by a small pedicle. Fibroid in structure. Removed in the course of an opera- tion for hydrocele; the tunica vaginalis being somewhat thickened. 1862. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2845. A body that was found free in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis ; about the size of an apple-seed, smooth upon the surface, and about as firm as cartilage. The tunica vaginalis was healthy. Dr H has met with several similar cases. 1861. Dr. B. M. Hodges. 2846. The genital organs of a man who must have been cas- • trated before puberty. — The penis is not far from an inch in length; and beneath it was a scar upon each side.

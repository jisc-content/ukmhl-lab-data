153 MOKBID ANATOMY. in place by Mr. John Green, one of the house-pupils, have been colored so as to be designated. On dissection, lymph and pus were found beneath the dura mater, but no lacera- tion nor inflammation of the brain itself. 1866. Dr. H. G. ClarJc. 957. A portion of the frontal bone, showing a very extensive fracture. The patient, a boy, mt. 13, fell from the roof of a house; and, when brought to the hospital (138, 88) there was great depression of, and just above, the nasal bones “ the nose seeming to have been driven into the face.” He was very nearly senseless, and otherwise se- verely injured. The depressed bone was raised by Dr. Hodges, and the patient lived until the tenth day; con- sciousness remaining, more or less, until the last thirty hours. The nasal, and small portions of the adjoining bones were found completely detached, but still connected together, as shown in the preparation. The body of the sphenoid is also seen to have been broken. The fracture extended through the base of the skull, to the occiput, and there was some separation of the lambdoidal suture, with a separate fracture upon one side of the head. Pus was found beneath the dura mater, along the longitudinal sinus ; and extensive softening of the cerebellum. 1868. * Dr. G. H. Gay. 9o8.

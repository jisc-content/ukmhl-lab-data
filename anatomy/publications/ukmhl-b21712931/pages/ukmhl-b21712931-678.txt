656 MORBID ANATOMY. The patient’s mother, who is a woman of intelligence, stated that the tumor had been forming ten or twelve years ; but grew slowly until the last three years; then its growth became very rapid, and during the last year it about doubled its size. There had been pain in the “ cords of the neck ” and down the arm occasionally for years ; and sometimes it extended below the elbow. But the patient had no pain in the tumor, and it troubled him only by its weight. His general health had been as good the last ten years as it was the ten preceding. After the hem- orrhage the ulcers upon the surface of the tumor enlarged, and became deeper and sloughed; so that after death a cavity was found not far from 7 or 8 in. in diameter, and 1 or 2 in. in depth, with much of the calcareous matter exposed upon the inner surface. The pain in the arm in- creased, but still there was none in the tumor. He was also unable to move his fingers or the forearm, and there was much numbness, though of this last there had been some before. Meanwhile he was confined to his bed, with loss of flesh, strength, and appetite. ‘(See No. 3019.) 1863. Museum Fund. 3008-10.

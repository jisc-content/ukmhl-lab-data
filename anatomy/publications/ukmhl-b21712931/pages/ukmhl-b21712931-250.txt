MORBID ANATOMY. 228 siderable depth below the surface is as solid as the bone itself. The two at last become fused, as a thick, solid mass, so that upon a partial examination a periosteal de- posit might not have been thought of. Upon the other side of the bone are some appearances of a similar deposit, and in which there is a complete fusion. As usual, even in the oldest of such deposits, the cavity of the bone remains ; whereas in ostitis it is often obliter- ated. 1847. Dr. J. 0. Warren. \ 1249. Longitudinal section of lower third of femur; enlaiged from old periosteal disease, and upon the surface rough and irregular ; structure light and reticular. 184/. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1250. The shaft of the femur, enlarged by an old periosteal deposit. On section, the original walls of the bone are more or less cancellated, and to a considerable extent they are no longer traceable. Cavity obliterated. 1847. Dr. J. C. Wairen. 1251. Two femora; mates. Old periosteal deposit along shafts, and surface quite porous. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1252 Femur, very similar to the last. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 9 1253. Femur, of which the shaft is enlarged by a periosteal deposit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1254. A tibia, wanting the two extremities, but more or less diseased so far as shown; a periosteal deposit, generally thin, and, in its pinkish color, bearing a striking resem- blance to some of the urinary calculi that consist of the urate of soda. The deposit is rather earthy and crumbling, and so intimately fused with the bone, as seen on section, that its existence might almost have been questioned; a second section, however, defines the outline of the two very perfectly. The cavity of the bone is becoming cancellated. External surface not porous nor foliated, as it so often is in periosteal deposit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1255. Tibia, enlarged anteriorly, and midway, as in case of a node. Section shows a periosteal deposit, of which

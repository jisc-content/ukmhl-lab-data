MORBID ANATOMY. 284 metacarpal bone of the index finger, and taken by Mr. C. H. Hildreth, one of the house-pupils. The patient was an Irish girl, jet. eighteen years. (Hospital, 48, 116.) The tumor, ten years before entrance, was of the size of a bean, and had gradually increased. Never painful nor tender; and the motions of the finger were but little affected. It measured 4 in. in circumference, and l£ in. in elevation ; knobbed in form; bony to the feel, and firmly connected with the bone, though not with the integument; the exten- sor tendon passing on the ulnar side. Removed by Dr. W., who found it to be altogether a bony formation ; and the patient did well. 1851. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1470. An osseous growth, about £ in. in diameter, and sur- rounded by a thick cartilaginous formation; a section showing that the structure is cancellated. Removed from the back part and anterior extremity of the metacarpal bone. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1471. The upper part of the femur, showing a most exuberant coralloid growth of bone in broad, hard, and irregular laminae, arising from the linea aspera, and just below the trochanter minor ; the base being quite defined. The bone, otherwise, is quite healthy. Placed with the exostoses, though it may have been the bony skeleton of some tumor. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1472. Upper portion of the femur, showing an exuberant growth of soft bone, about and below the small trochanter. No cancerous disease about it in the recent state. 1854. Mr. Wm. Henderson, vied, student. 1473. Long, section of the lower portion of the femur; the whole anterior portion of which projects forward, and par- ticularly at one point from which, as Dr. W. stated, a car- tilaginous tumor had been removed. Structure of the bone quite healthy. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1474. A patella, showing a considerable and defined growth of new bone from its lower margin, and below the articular surface. Bone otherwise healthy. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1475. A broad, irregular expansion of hard bone, from the upper half, and along the inner surface of the fibula, and

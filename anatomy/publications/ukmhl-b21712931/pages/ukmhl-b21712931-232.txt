210 MOItBID ANATOMY. The position of the forearm seems to have been one of partial flexion and eversion. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1178. Scaphoid bone torn from the wrist; a small piece only having been broken olf. From a young girl who had her hand crushed between the cog-wheels in a mill, Oct. 17th, 1863. It was entirely separated from the radius ; the radial artery and nerve, and the extensor tendons of the three first fingers being se\- ered. On the 1st of February it had quite healed, with anchylosis upon the radial side ; and the patient Anally got a very fair use of the hand, though it never could be fully extended. 1865. Dr. George J.

A wound upon the palmar aspect, about 2 in. in length, was the result, and the bone, which lay in the wound, was retained only by a few shreds of tissue. The cuneiform bone was loosened, but easily replaced, and two small fragments of it are seen attached to the semi- lunar. The other bones were uninjured, and none of the tendons were ruptured, but there was an unnatural mobility of the wrist-joint, and the void left by the dislocated bone was easily detected, especially upon the back of the wrist; there being neither swelling nor deformity. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. C., and the bone was removed by Dr. Hodges about four hours after the acci- dent. On the sixth day swelling and inflammation com- menced; suppuration of the cellular tissue as high as the shoulder was the result, and the man died on the tenth tU Dr. H. remarked on the rarity of compound dislocation of a single carpal bone, except as the result of gun shot oi machinery wounds; the accident being caused in the few cases that he quoted, and with one exception, by a fa upon the palm of the extended hand ; and the semi-lunai

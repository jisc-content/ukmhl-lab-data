608 MORBID ANATOMY. hard, except at one part, where it was as hard as scirrhus. 1861. Dr. C. Ellis. 2821. The same. A colored lithograph of a small tumor, and section of the same. Another figure in the same plate shows a minute lobe picked to pieces, and of the natural size. Another shows this same lobe magnified 30 linear, and the irregularly enlarged lobules, of which it is com- posed, forming a botryoidal mass. In another figure the edges of these lobules are seen, magnified 300 linear, with hypertrophy of the fibrous element and sparse cells. 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2822. A defined cyst, about 3 in. in diameter, and into which there projects a regular, round tumor, filling the greater part of it, remarkably concentric in structure, and which, in its nature, is apparently malignant. Outside of the cyst is a considerable mass of disease, but from which a portion has evidently been cut away ; smooth on the cut surface, and less opaque than the tumor within the cyst. — Removed from a lady about fifty years of age ; no decided pain. 1861. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiu. The following six models by Thibert, were given in 1847, by Dr. G. Hayward. 2823-4. Scirrhus, and section. 2825. Cancer, with disease of skin. 2826. Encephaloid disease. 2827. A large, deep, and vei’y defined cavity, with disease of the glands, — the result of cancer. 2828. Extensive ulceration, and half cicatrized; the result of cancerous destruction of the gland. 2829. Section of a scirrhous breast. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2830. A regular, defined, smooth, ulcerated mass, projecting from the surface of the breast; about 2 in. in diameter, and 4 in. thick. Subjacent parts probably not much affected. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2831. Encephaloid; the disease has extended just below the • surface, though the skin is not yet broken. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

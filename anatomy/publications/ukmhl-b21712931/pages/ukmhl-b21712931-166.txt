Gay, who had charge of the patient until the 1st of Nov. From the Mass. Gen. Hospital he went directly to the Maiine Hospital at Chelsea, where he was under the care of Dr. Graves. On admission he walked with crutches, but on the 10th of January he could walk very well with- out even a cane, and he continued to improve until he left the hospital, on the 23d of March. 1867.

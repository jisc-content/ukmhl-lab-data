The other half of the lower portion of the same, showing suppuration of the medullary membrane. 1072. Fracture of the neck of the femur, close to the head, and with almost no change. From a negress, set. ninety-nine years and nine months. Too feeble for a long time to go out; and fell as she was walking across her room. There was at the time, shorten- ing, eversion, mobility, and crepitus; scarcely any pain except when the limb was moved, and then not at all se- vere. No treatment. Sat up about half of the time after the first few days ; and she seemed to fail from being con- fined to her bed more than usual. Died five months after the accident. 1865.

Also a fracture of the neck, jiist above the trochanters. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1075. Fracture between the neck and shaft; the great trochan- ter being also broken off.

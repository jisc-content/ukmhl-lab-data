122 HEALTIIY ANATOMY. “ Neither pectoralis major nor minor were found. “ A serratus magnus, on each side, arises from the ribs, and is inserted as usual into the base of the scapula on the same side with itself. “ A right and left latissimus dorsi, supra and infraspi- natus, teres major and minor, are all inserted into their re- spective portions of the humerus on each side. The deltoid arises equally from the two portions of scapula and the end of the compound clavicle ; it is inserted sjunmetrically into the humerus. A subscapularis arises from each base of the scapula, but the two are inserted into each other by the union of the tendons, just behind the glenoid cavity. “ The triceps has two long heads, one arising from the edge of each half of the scapula, and twro short heads aris- ing from the side of the humerus, and is inserted as usual into the olecranon. “ In the place of the biceps and brachialis is a single muscle, arising from the humerus by a pointed head on each side of the deltoid, and in this respect resembling the brachialis; but, like the biceps, its tendon is inserted into the radius. There was no long head. Its action would be that of the biceps. “ The following muscles were repeated symmetrically on the two sides of this third arm : — “ Supinator longus and S. brevis. “ Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. “ Extensor carpi ulnaris. “ Extensor carpi digitorum communis. “ Extensor longus pollicis. “ Abductor longus. “ There were no flexors or pronators, nor any extensor proprius of the index or little fingers. “ Below the ribs and their cartilages on this side of the foetus, some ill-defined muscles occupied the place of the broad muscles of the abdomen, but could not be identified as such. “ A psoas and iliacus interims existed on each side, but both were inserted into the single trochanter minor on the front of the femur. “ A glutceus maximus arose from each side of the com-

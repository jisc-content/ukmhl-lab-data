MORBID ANATOMY. 312 1581. A specimen, very similar to the last. These last were from adult subjects. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1582. Tibia of an adult, compressed laterally, curved antero- posteriorly, and very dense and heavy. Sawed lengthwise by Dr. H. ; walls generally much thickened, and particu- larly along the concavity. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1583. The scapula, humerus, radius and ulna, femur, tibia and fibula, from a young civette. Light from atrophy; and most of the bones much curved as from rickets ; but other- wise healthy in appearance. There is an old fracture of the femur, regularly united ; and the other femur, which Dr. W. has with the other bones, had also been fractured. 1858. Dr. J. Wyman. 1584. A portion of the skull of an edentulous old woman, showing a large and defined depression, corresponding to the situation of the lachrymal sac, which was about as large as a marble. The contents of the sac were ropy, and somewhat brownish; and the duct was quite closed near the opening, into the nostrils. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1585. A portion of the skull, showing deep pits, in which were lodged the Pacchionian bodies ; one of them almost amount- ing to a perforation. â€” From a man, forty years of age. 1855. Dr. C. Ellis. 1586. Three ribs comprossed into close apposition, and to a considerable extent flattened vertically; the result, un- doubtedly, of a former pleurisy, though no reference was made to this disease. From a man, set. twenty-three, who died at the hospital of renal disease (222, 230). General appearance sufficiently healthy. Over the left lung were universal and strong adhesions; the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs are here shown, with an extensive cretaceous deposit upon the inner surface. Posteriorly in the false membrane there was a soft curdy substance; and a few tubercles were found in the apices of the lungs. The ribs and cretaceous matter have been dried in con- nection. 1859. Dr. G. Ellis.

MORBID ANATOMY. 554 a mixture of triple phospli., carb. and phospli. of lime. 1" 10'" by 1" 1'". 2622. Ovoid. Centre lost. Outer portion ; ur. ac., urates of potassa and lime, phospli. of lime and triple phospli. 1" 8'" by 1" 3'". 2623. Flattened; ovoid. Ur. ac., urates of ammonia and pot- ash ; very little triple phosph. present. Exterior, granu- lar. 1" 5"' by 1" 2'". 2624. Broad oval. Centre, ur. ac., and urates of ammonia and magnesia. Outer part is a mixture of phosph. of lime and triple phosphate. 1" 7'" by 1" 2'". 2625. Thin, oval. Nucleus, ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia. Outer layers, phosph. of lime, triple phosph., and a little ur. of ammonia. 1" 9'" by 1" 2"'. 2626. Fragment of a cylindrical calculus, showing by course of laminae that two nuclei were once present, and at a long distance apart; a very interesting specimen. The fawn- colored striae are ur. of ammonia and ur. ac. The remain- der consists of phosph. of lime and triple phosphate. 2627. Irregular mass; mixture of phosphate of lime, triple phosph., ur. ac. and ur. of ammonia and soda. 10" by 8'". 2628. Cylindrical. Friable. Phosph. of lime, triple phosph., intermixed with ur. of ammonia, and a little ur. acid. 1" 8"' by 10'". 2629. Conical, oblong. Ur. of ammonia and ur. ac. The white parts are composed of the phosph. of lime and triple phosph. 2" by 1". 2630. Rough, and irregularly laminated. Ur. ac., ur. of am- monia, carb. of lime, and triple phosph. 10'" by 7'". 2631. Ovoid. Nucleus, ur. ac. and ox. of lime. Outer por- tion ox. of lime. External surface thickly studded with prominent rugged tubercles. 1" 1'" by 9'". 2632. Ox. of lime and uric acid. Original length, 1" 5'" by 1". Exterior shows marks of erosion. Oblong, oval. 2633. Ox. of lime and ur. acid. 1" by 10'". Firm mulberry calculus ; exterior studded with warty tubercles. 2634. Ox. of lime and ur. acid. 10'" by 7'". Exterior distinctly granular and sanded. 2635. Ox. of lime and ur. acid. 10'" by 7'". Oblong, oval. Exterior tuberculuted and rough.

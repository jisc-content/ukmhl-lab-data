Malformations. 437"8. Photographs, and a colored lithograph, of the “Aztec children,” male and female ; idiot dwarfs, and probably from Mexico. 1862. Museum Fund. On the 7th of January, 1867, the Aztecs were married, in London, and in great style. For an account of the cere- mony, as given by the “ London Herald,” see the “ Boston Transcript,” for Jan. 25. 439. Photographs of the “Australian children,” also male and female, and resembling each other enough to be brother and sister, as did the “ Aztecs.” They also resembled these last, but were older and larger than the “Aztecs” would have been ; and it was ascertained, beyond any reasonable doubt, that they were not the same. The male was 5 ft. 3 in. in height, and the female, 4 ft. 3 in. The male could say a few words, as “No,” “You lie;” but the female had never been known to utter a word. They looked very healthy, were very active and vivacious, as such sub- jects usually are, and very salacious. Breasts of the fe- male well developed. Apparently Caucasians. 1866. Museum Fund.

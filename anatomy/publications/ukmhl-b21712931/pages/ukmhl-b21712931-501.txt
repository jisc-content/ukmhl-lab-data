MORBID ANATOMY. 479 other organs were healthy. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxiv. p. 549.) 1861. Dr. G. Ellis. 2287. Thibert’s model. Numerous, large, and chronic ulcera- tions of the colon; chiefly between the folds of the mu- cous membrane. Parietes thickened and indurated. 1849. Dr. J. Ware. 2288. Ulceration of the large intestine. About midway the mucous membrane was almost entirely destroyed to the extent of 6 in.; and throughout the whole of this intes- tine there was more or less ulceration; the base of the largest, and many of the smaller, ulcers being covered with large, grayish granulations.

For the last inch and a half it is not so much an ulceration as an irregular abscess, bur- rowing between the rectum and the vagina. Above the seat of disease the mucous membrane was quite healthy, excepting a fistulous opening into a portion of the large intestine, that adhered to the rectum, as seen in the prepa- ration. 1861. .Dr. J.

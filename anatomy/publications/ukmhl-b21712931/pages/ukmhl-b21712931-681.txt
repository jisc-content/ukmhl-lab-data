MORBID ANATOMY. 659 x a. tendency to the formation of irregular, cartilaginous corpuscles; but there were none seen that were well marked. The patient recovered well from the operation ; and some years afterward there had been no return of the disease. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., July, 1853, p. 84.) 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3021. Lithographs of the above case. 1st. A section of the tumor, colored, and of full size. 2d. Four small figures ; two of the hand, as shown in the cast; one of the tumor as first noticed ; and one to show the flattening of the ten- don over the tumor. 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3022.

G. Clark. 3023. Cast of a hand, showing a defined enchondromatous tumor upon the back of the first phalanx of the index finger, of a regular ovoid form, and about 1£ in. in length. The subject was a healthy young man, and the disease of ten years’ duration. Removed with the bone-forceps, and returned in two or three years. 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 3024. An enchondromatous tumor, removed from one of the ribs. It is considerably larger than the fist, of a some- what ovoid form, and the appearances, on section, are

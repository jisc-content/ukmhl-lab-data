Dr. T. saw her two weeks before her death, for the first time, and on the occasion of a hsemoptisis, the amount of blood lost being at least a pint. She had once or twice before raised a few bloody sputa; and the day before the hemorrhage she had played out of doors, and rather more actively than usual.

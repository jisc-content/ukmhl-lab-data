HEALTHY ANATOMY. 89 821. Foetus, entire ; in spirit. Spine open throughout, as well as the vault of the cranium ; but upon the base of this last there appears to be a considerable portion of brain. Yarns of both feet. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 822. A second specimen, very similar to the last, but without the appearance of brain; the malformation, also, extends no further than the upper part of the neck. Sex, female. This form of monstrosity is fully described in the Cata- logue of the Med. Society’s Cabinet (p. 247). 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 822£. A third specimen, similar to the last, and that, having been for a time preserved entire in spirit, was afterward removed and dried ; and now strikingly resembles one that is figured by St. Hilaire (Anom. de l’Org.), and that was found in the Egyptian catacombs. 1868. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. A very similar malformation is shown in a “ Double- headed ” Duck, No. 900. 823. A fourth specimen, preserved entire. The cranial and spinal cavities are open as far as the sacrum. Brain wanting; but, in the recent state, there were appearances of spinal marrow in the form of two flat and very thin bands, about two lines in width, and lying side by side, if they were not fused ; toward the upper part these bands were thicker, and quite distinct. Spinal nerves not ex- posed. Upon the base of the skull there was a considera- ble quantity of cellulo-vascular tissue, but nothing that could be called a tumor. There was no neck ; the ears were doubled down, with a narrow margin of hair about the base of the skull, as usual, and the eyes were promi- nent and turned upward, so as to give it the characteristic appearance of a large bull-frog. Labor was premature, judging from the size of the foetus, which presented b}' the feet, and was still-born. Quantity of liquor amnii very profuse, as it usually is, more or less. The mother had previously had three well-formed children ; and never felt the motions of this last. 1853. Dr. Win. E. Townsend.

MORBID ANATOMY. 182 1063. Recent and irregularly transverse fracture of neck of femur near the head of the capsule. Dried, without macer- ation. 1861. '1064. Fracture of the neck, within the capsule, and nearly transverse. The upper portion of the bone is shown, with a portion of the os innominatum, and a longitudinal sec- tion through the two. The capsular ligament was intact at the time of the examination. The patient was a female, set. eighty-four years, and the accident happened from a slight cause. There was strong eversion, shortening apparently to the extent of 2 in., and such severe pain that etherization was necessary before she could be removed to her bed ; crepitus then was distinct. A weight was attached to the limb, and she became quiet; but pain, more or less severe, continued until she became unconscious, a day or two before death, which occuiied on the twentieth day ; large bed-sores forming from the irrita- tion of the urine with which she was constantly kept wet. 1gg9> Dr. B. E. Dotting. 1065. Irregularly transverse fracture of the neck, and about at the junction with the head of the bone. The capsulai lig- ament is mostly torn through, but to a considerable extent it remains, and shows that the head, in such cases, would not have to depend entirely upon the round ligament lor its supply of blood. A small piece is broken from the tip of the great trochanter. From the appearances the pa- tient maj7, have lived some little time after the accident. 1855. The following five Thibertâ€™s models were given in 1847. Dr. Geo. Hayward. 1066. Fracture of the neck within the capsule, from a fall upon the trochanter. There was inflammation of the bone ; and a large abscess communicated with the interior. 1067-8. Fracture of the neck, within the capsule ; with section of the bone, showing inflammation of the medullary mem- brane.

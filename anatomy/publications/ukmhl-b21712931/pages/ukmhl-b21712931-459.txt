A cyst between the lung and the diaphragm of one of the cattle that was killed during the summer of 1861, and when the “ cattle disease ” was prevalent. It is about 6 in. in diameter; the parietes are thick and dense ; and the contents, which have been removed, consisted of a yellow fibrinous material, and calcareous matter. (See Report of the Mass. Board of Agriculture, for 1860, p. 68.) 1862. Dr. C. Ellis. 2161. A thick, cretaceous plate, that in the recent state almost lined the whole inside of the chest upon the left side. There was great contraction of the side, great compression of the lung, and universal, thick, and very strong pleural adhesions. Some adhesions, also, upon the right side, and tubercular disease of the lung. — From a middle-aged woman. 1856. Dr. Wm. Bushnell. 2162. A small plate of cretaceous matter, about 2 in. in length, and that was situated in a thick layer of condensed fibro- cellular substance, that bound the right lung to the costal parietes. From a man, set. sixty-five; the result, probably, of a disease that occurred about fifteen years before death, and that lasted about a year. The resemblance between these formations, that result from inflammation of the pleura, and those that are found in the bronchial and mesenteric glands, as the result of “tubercular” disease, is often very striking, and tends to show an alliance between this last and the process of “ inflammation.” 1853. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2163. A third specimen ; mostly in one piece, and altogether larger than the palm of the hand. It was from an adult, and situated in the midst of uni- versal, fibro-cellular pleural adhesions. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. A fourth specimen ; in connection with the ribs. (See No. 1586.) 2164.

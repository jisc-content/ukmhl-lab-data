MORBID ANATOMY. 202 with probable fracture, and some appearances of ostitis. Tibia sawed. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1146. Old, oblique fracture of tibia, just above the ankle ; and of the internal malleolus. Union strong, but with a considerable inward curvature. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1147. Oblique fracture of tibia, near the ankle-joint. Union strong and regular, with anchylosis to fibula. 1858. Dr. B. M. Hodges. 1148. Fracture of both bones, at lower third, and somewhat comminuted. Union strong, though some openings remain at the seat of injury. There is also anchylosis between the bones. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1149. Upper extremity of the tibia, broken from the shaft, and through into the joint. One fragment is united by bone to the outer condyle of the femur, and stands off from it at an angle of about 45Â°. From the back of the other fragment a small piece has been broken off, and imperfectly united ; and from its lower extremity a considerable piece of dead bone is being separated. Some new deposit is seen upon both fragments. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1150. Old fracture of the fibula through its lower articular sur- face. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1151. A second specimen. Now dried, but showing, when recent, a free articular surface between the fragments. From the same case as No. 1021. 1866. Dr. D. W. Clieever. 1152. A third specimen. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1153. A very marked, defined, and regular enlargement of the tibia, in its lower third, about 2 in. in extent, involving equally the whole circumference, and that may be called fusiform. Having been sawed longitudinally by Dr. Hodges, the walls of the bone, at the affected part, are dense as well as thickened; and the cavity, though not

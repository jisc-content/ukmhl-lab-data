Lithograph of a specimen of fibro-cellular hypertrophy of the skin over the mamma. — Disease began at the age of eleven j'ears, removed at the age of twenty-two, and returned at the age of twenty-eight. The figure shows it as it appeared after it was removed by Dr. B. Four or five years afterward the disease had not returned. It con- sisted of hard, dense masses, involving the skin, and in- separable from the fat, sometimes growing around the fatty masses, but generally by itself.

J. Bigelow. 2012. Cast of the knee ; showing a congenital najvus. The patient was twenty-one years of age, and entered the hospital Dec. 25th, 1852 (56, 67). There were four dusky red spots, from 4 in. to 2 in. in diameter ; and dui- ker the last two years they had increased in size, and be- come so sore that he was obliged to hold his dress off when walking. They were hard to the feel and very tender ; and at one spot they were so, without discoloration. Ice and salt were applied to produce cold ; but the part was frozen. Free subcutaneous incisions were afterwards made, and the patient was discharged March 20th, very much relieved, though the discoloration remained the same. Cast taken bv Mr Wm. N. Lane, one of the house-pupils. 185‘ . J ‘ Dr. J. M. Warren.

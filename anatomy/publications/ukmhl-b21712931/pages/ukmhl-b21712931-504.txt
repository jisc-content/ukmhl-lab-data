Otherwise the dilated in- testine was quite health}'', though the muscular coat was much hypertrophied. The other organs were also healthy, excepting the uterus, which contained two fibrous tumors, that were felt during life through the vagina. From a woman, set. thirty-four years, previously healthy, and who died on the 22d of November. In April she had an attack of obstinate constipation, pain in the abdomen, and vomiting ; relieved by cathartics. In June a similar attack.

Inner surface for the most part superficially ulcerated ; but without thickening of the parietes, or any appearance of malignant disease. The intestine above was much dilated, and somewhat ulcerated ; but otherwise healthy, as it was below the seat of disease. Three or four feet higher up, also, the intestine was contracted ; and again in the duo- denum, 2 in. below the pylorus. From a patient of Dr. Stone, Jr., of Walpole; set. fifty-

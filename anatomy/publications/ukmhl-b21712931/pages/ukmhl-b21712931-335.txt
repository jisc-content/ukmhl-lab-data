I he patient was a man, twent3^-three years of age, who had had his leg amputated during the Civil War. The stump did not heal for a long time, was very painful, and he had never been able to wear an artificial leg. Feb. 12th 1868, he entered the hospital (134, 180), with much pain at the end of the stump, and a firm attachment of the cicatrix to the ends of the bones at that part. On pressure between the ends of the bones, the limb was instantly thrown into violent convulsions. A year previously a sequestrum had been removed. On the day of his admission the bones were removed, and on the 11th of March the man was dis- charged well. The tibia is enlarged, and, besides the usual appearances of chronic inflammation, shows upon the inner surface a considerable cavity that must have contained the sequestrum. The two bones are anchylosed at the lower ex- tremities. Prepared by Mr. B. B. Kent, one of the house- PUPils‘ 1869’ Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1590.

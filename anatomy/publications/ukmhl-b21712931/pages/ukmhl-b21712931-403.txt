381 MORBID ANATOMY. SERIES XXIII. â€”NERVOUS SYSTEM. I. Brain. 1864. A portion of the brain, showing the effects of a gun-shot injury. From a soldier, who was wounded Aug. 30th. For the first three days he was about the wards during a part of the time, perfectly conscious, with a good appetite, and with- out pain ; and insisted that a ball had not entered his head. Sept. 3d he was found comatose, and on the morning of the 5th he died. A defined fracture of the frontal bone was found half an inch above the centre of the right supra-orbital ridge ; and in the brain, where the ball entered, an abscess of the size of a walnut, with bits of bone. The ball had evidently traversed the whole length of the lateral ventricle, and en- tered the posterior hemisphere, from which last it dropped when the brain was removed. The parietes of the ventri- cle were considerably abraded, and infiltrated with pus, as was the brain along the track of the ball. It was sup- posed that the ball penetrated no deeper than the anterior portion of the brain at first, but that it subsequently grav- itated to where it was at last found. 1863. Dr. Francis H. Brown. The following nine models by Thibert were presented in 1849. Dr. John Ware. 1865. Brain congested, with small drops of blood upon the cut surface. 1866. Three separate and defined effusions of blood, on section of brain. 1867. A larger effusion. < 1868. Large effusion into the left ventricle. 1869. Very exteusive and defined capillary apoplexy upon the surface of the convexity of the brain. The membranes are stripped off, the convolutions are flattened or effaced, and the surface is of a dark, purplish-red color. 1870. Inflammation of the substance of the brain. A mottled

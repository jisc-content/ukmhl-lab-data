HEALTIIY ANATOMY. 53 eye in this fish, -with figures, founded upon the dissection of three specimens, and a partial examination of fourteen others. In one that measured four inches in length, the eyes were XV in. in their long diameter, of an oval form, and black; and a filament of nerve was distinctly traced from the globe to the cranial walls. Examined under the microscope, with a power of about twenty diameters, Dr. W. made out satisfactorily a sclerotic, a layer of pig- ment cells that might be regarded as a choroid, and of col- orless cells to represent the retina; and in the front part of the globe, a lenticular body, about which he thought there was a question as to whether it should be regarded as the crystalline lens, or not. 527.

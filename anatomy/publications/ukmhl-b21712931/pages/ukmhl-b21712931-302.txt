Gradually increasing swell- ing, but without much inconvenience until the last three months, when an opening formed, and he gave up his work. On admission, the ankle was about twice its natural size, and denuded bone was felt. On the 28th the joint was cut down upon ; and, after forcible dislocation, the bones were removed ; the tendons being preserved, and two ligatures only being required. Oct. 16th the parts were not doing well, and the leg was amputated. Still further the stump did not do well, and on the 15th of Feb. li in. of the bone were removed. March 24th he left the hospital. Oct. 26th he was readmitted; Dec. 12th bone was again removed, and on the 23d of Feb. he was discharged well. 1867. Dr. R. M. Iloclges. 1453.

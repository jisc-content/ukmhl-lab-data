MOEBID ANATOMY. 205 fibula about iu. above the joint; and the union was firm. The lower fragments were bent strongly forward upon the dorsum of the foot, and the upper fragments were united to them at a right angle. The bones were forcibly broken down, the tendo-achillis was cut, and the parts kept in proper position, but the result was only partially satis- . factory. 1856. Dr. H. G. Clark. 1162. A third case, in which the fragments are bent upon each other, and the lower one upon the foot, precisely as in the two above cases. A ligamentary preparation. The patient was a delicate girl, twenty-two years of age, and one of the lowest prostitutes. The bones were broken when she was five or six years old, and her case was entirely neglected. In the spring of 1862, Dr. Carney, who was then the physician of the Bridgewater State Alms- house, cut out about 1 in. each of the tibia and fibula; the tibia being very sharply flexed, and closely united, though not by bone. (See next specimen.) The limb, which was sti aightened, was 1^- in. longer than before, and union was progressing well. Six weeks after the operation, Dr. C. lesigned his situation ; and his successor, finding the union incomplete, rubbed the ends of the bones together, with a view to complete it, and continued this treatment for three weeks. From the time that she left B. she walked without Clutches, and flat upon the sole of the foot; limb bowed outward, and very much shortened, but much less than before the operation ; considerable stiffness at seat of frac- ture. The union is seen to be very close, but it is not osseous. In January, 1866, the patient died at another almshouse. 1866. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 1163. Fragments of bone, from the last case. 1867. Dr. Sidney H. Carney. 1161. Poition of a tibia, enlarged and quite rough about and tow aid one of its extremities, as from inflammation; and, otheiwise quite healthy. Perhaps from a case of ununited fracture. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1123. Comminuted fracture of the inner condyle, with a conical ball in the middle and back part of the knee-joint. The patient, an army officer, entered the hospital (106, 92) fourteen days after a wound, just above, and upon the inside of the knee. Two days after admission a large amount of pus was discharged through an opening upon the outside of the knee, and the inner condyle, which was found loose, was removed. Nine days after admission the limb was amputated by Dr. H.; and three or four days aftei waid severe chills came on, followed by dyspnoea, yellowness of the skin, and delirium. Six days after the operation he died. The ball was found tying in the joint; the patella was fractured ; and there was an extensive infiltration of pus into the soft parts. (Med. Jour.

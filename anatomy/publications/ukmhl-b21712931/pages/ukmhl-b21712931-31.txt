Sections of the neck of the femur, to show how its ana- tomical structure explains the phenomena of extra-capsular fracture, to which it is so liable ; made b}r Dr. Bigelow, and described by him as follows : — “ To exhibit this structure, which has hitherto been un- noticed, sections should be made in the following; man- 7 O ner: — “ A well-developed femur is to be secured, in a nearly vertical position; the axis of the neck being carefully placed in the plane of the horizon. A thin slice is now taken from the top of the neck, including at its extremities the top of the head of the bone, and the top of the great trochanter; this section passing through the neck, in a direction parallel with the plane of the horizon. A sec- ond, third, and fourth slice, each one-fourth of an inch thiclc, are now to be sawed from the neck, parallel with the first. There will now remain, attached to the shaft of the femur, only the lower part of the head, and a narrow lower isthmus of the neck. On examining the cut surface of this last section, it will be found that the anterior wall of the neck is one-eighth of an inch thick, or more, while the posterior wall is of a papery thickness only.

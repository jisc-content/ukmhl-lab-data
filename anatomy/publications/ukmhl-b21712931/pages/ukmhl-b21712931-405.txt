883 MORBID ANATOMY. was swollen and rather firm. ' Ventricles large; with serous effusion; membranes remarkably free from mois- ture ; strongly adherent to dura mater,' over the abscess, to the extent of about lines, with a direct opening through the bone (No. 1279), between the abscess within and the one external to the bone. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. I published the above case, with eight others, of abscess of the brain, in the Med. Jour. Vol. lxxii. p. 353. II. Membranes. Four models by Thibert. 1849. Dr. J. Ware. 1875. Uniform redness from congestion of the membranes over the convexity of the brain. 1876. Small effusion of blood at the base. 1877. Extensive effusion of blood into the membranes at the base of the brain. 1878. The same appearances as in the last. 1879. Cysts from the arachnoid cavity, and in connection with meningeal apoplexy. The patient, rnt. sixty-five, received a severe blow upon the back of the head and neck, in July, 1857, and had pain from that time. July 14th, 1858, he entered the hospital (217, 188), with his memory much impaired, but having never had paralysis nor anything like an apoplectic attack. His health had been rapidly failing for the last few weeks, and he died comatose, July 26th. The cysts, which extended nearly from the longitudinal sinus to the base of the brain, were thick, firm, and opaque. One upou the right side contained about two ounces of thin blood, and soft, blackish coagula, with some yellowish fibrine adhering to the inner surfaces. Within about an inch of the periphery, and all around, the two walls united, and then, as a single layer, became thinner until they were gradually lost in the dura mater. Upon the left side, the walls of the cavity seemed to have been in contact. Both hemispheres were flattened beneath the cysts, which ad- hered very slightly, if at all, to the arachnoid, but pretty firmly to the dura mater. The brain was healthy.

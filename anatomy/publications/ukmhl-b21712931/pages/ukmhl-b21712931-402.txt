There were a few spindle-shaped fibrous cells; but no larger cells, nor evidence of any malignant disease. The boy recovered well, and it was thought that the dis- ease would not return. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxviii. p. 259.) Eight months after the operation, however, the disease did return, and at the end of a year the tumor was two-thirds as large as before. Other glands were enlarged, with a failure of the general health, and the patient probably soon died. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxii. p. 20.) 1863. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 1858-9.

A collection of enlarged cervical glands, from a case of leucocythemia. The patient, a boy, eight years old, entered the hospital Oct. 12th, 1864 (117, 174). Always quite healthy until a severe burn on the chest a year and a half before. Soon after recovery a tumor appeared just below the left ear, and steadily increased. He was anaemic, with two or three “ scrofulous sores” on the head, and two irregularly lobu- lated, and quite movable tumors in the neck, — one just below the ear, and the other just above the clavicle. Spleen somewhat enlarged, and easily felt. Number of white corpuscles in the blood very little if at all increased. At the time of removal the glands were found in large num- bers, extending in all directions, and even beneath the sternum ; from the size of a pea to that of a pigeon’s egg ; and a few were left, as, from the loss of blood, and the pa- tient s condition, it was not thought safe to prolong the operation. On the 26th the wound had nearly healed, and the boy left the hospital. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1862-3. Ambrotypos of the above case. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow.

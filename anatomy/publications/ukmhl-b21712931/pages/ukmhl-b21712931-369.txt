347 MORBID ANATOMY. pancreas, and serous membranes; specimens being pre- served in this Museum, and in the Med. Society’s. (See Arner. Jour, of Med. Sc., April, 1848, p. 379.) 1849. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1745. A very marked constriction of the aorta, just where it formerly received the ductus arteriosus. The remains of this last are shown, but the cord is impervious. — From a j^oung man, nineteen years of age, who had an aneurism of the left axillary artery, and died after a ligature of the subclavian by Dr. Hodges. There had been no symptoms, however, previously of the constriction. This specimen should have been entered rather as a malformation. 1868. Dr. Chas. II. Spring. Ossification of the coronary artery; No. 1755. III. Arteries. 1746. Laceration of the aorta, about an inch above the iliacs. From a man who was jammed between two railroad cars, and died in about two hours. (Hospital, 34, 173.) The rupture is in the posterior parietes, extends through all of the coats about an inch longitudinally, and half an inch transversely at the upper extremity. There was about half a pint of blood in the peritoneal cavity, and a large amount in the cellular tissue; but the organs were not injured. 1852. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1747. Ligature of the common carotid, and cut open to show the coagulum. — The patient lived about seventy-six hours after the operation. From the same patient as No. 947. 1863. Dr. R. M. Hoclges. 1748. Arch of the aorta, with the carotids ; both of which last were tied near the bifurcation. The right is plugged up throughout about one-half its length; and the left almost from its origin to the ligature. There is a plug, also, in the right internal carotid. From the same patient as No. 1506. 1858. Dr. H J. Bigelow. 1749. A specimen, labelled by Dr. W., u Ligature of the caro- tid.” Probably from a man, iet. twenty-eight, who died of phthisis, and whose carotid had been tied four years

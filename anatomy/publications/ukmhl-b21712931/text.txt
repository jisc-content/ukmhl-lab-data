A DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM. BY J. B. S. JACKSON, M.D., CURATOR OF THE MUSEUM; AND SHATTUCK PROFESSOR OF MORBID ANATOMY. BOSTON: A. WILLIAMS AND COMPANY.\3 INTRODUCTION. The Medical Department of Harvard University was es- tablished in the year 1782. In 1808 Dr. John C. Warren was appointed Adjunct Professor of Anatomy and Surgery ; and, when that chair was vacated, in the year 1815, by the death of his father, Dr. W. was appointed to fill his place. How faith- fully and honorably to himself, and to the College, he per- foi mod the duties of his office, and during a long period of yeais, is well known to the profession. The zeal with which he pm sued his favorite studies, and with which he improved the opportunities that a very extensive professional practice afforded him, led to the collection of a great number of patho- logical and other specimens; and, on resigning his professor- ship, in 1847, the greater part of this collection was presented to the College, and with it the sum of $6,000, for its preserva- tion and increase. In acknowledgment of so valuable a dona- tion, the Corporation of the University voted that the Museum should be called by the name of its founder. Unfortunately, Dr. W.’s time was so fully occupied by his professional prac- tice, that but,*little was left to him for those records, or even references, upon which the value of the pathological portion of a museum so much depends. Before the transfer, however, was made to the College, Dr. W. had a record made of the specimens, from his dictation ; but it was, for the most pait, and excepting a few references, a mere enumeration. . e teudency to preserve interesting specimens is very strong in so devoted an anatomist and surgeon as Dr. W. always had been ; and the consequence was, that he collected a large num- ber of what might essentially be called duplicates. Patholog- ical specimens that resemble each other very closely are ofte°n preserved in reference to their clinical history ; and the diver-INTRODUCTION. IV sity in regard to the symptoms, and the progress of two cases, when the anatomical appearances are nearly similar, is often a very interesting pathological fact. If, however, the history is wanting, and the duplicate must be preserved in spirit, it is an undesirable one; and accordingly many such were removed, after the collection came into the possession of the College. Since Dr. Warren made his donation, the collection has steadily increased from year to year; and it still continues to, as shown in part by the number of specimens that has been added since the printing of the catalogue was commenced last August, and that could not be introduced in their proper place; many others having been added, and that were so introduced. It would be impossible to enumerate the many individuals who have shown an active interest in the Museum, and to whom the College is greatly indebted; specimens having often been sent in from the country, and even from distant parts of the coun- try, as well as from our immediate neighborhood. Some of oui contributors, however, deserve especial notice. I he late Di. George Hayward, who occupied the chair of Surgery aud Clinical Surgery, for a period of ten years (1840-50), made a collection of Thibert’s models when he was in Europe, and for the illustration of his lectures. They amounted altogether to one hundred and sixty specimens, and in 1847 he presented them to the College. The late Dr. John Ware, also, Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine, collected ninety-one models by the same artist, and for the same purpose; and these he presented to the College in 1849. Prof. O. W. Holmes has made a great many valuable preparations, to illus- trate his department of healthy anatomy ; and he has also, independently of the Museum, a large number of microscopical preparations, either made by himself, or obtained by corre- spondence, and that he uses annually in a special course to the medical class. Prof. H. J. Bigelow has collected a large number of specimens in the course of his surgical practice, and many of them are of very great practical and scientific value A series of colored lithographs, illustrative of diseased structures, is very fine, and ought especially to be mentioned. They form a small portion of a large number of lithographs, that Prof. B. had taken many years ago, in connection with a proposed work on tumors, but which unfortunately was neverINTRODUCTION. V completed. Very exquisite drawings were made in water colors by a foreign artist, and from typical and recent speci- mens ; these were then lithographed, and the copies that are shown in the Museum were colored by the same artist, after the originals. A collection of enlarged drawings in water colors, by the same artist, suitable for the lecture-room, and illustrative of surgical anatomy and pathology, may also be alluded to, though independent of the Museum. In this col- lection there are four hundred and twenty-six plates, and altogether nine hundred and sixty-seven figures; many of the drawings being from recent specimens, and showing the micro- scopic as well as the gross appearances. Some of the other departments are, also, illustrated more or less fully. Prof. R. M. Hodges has always shown a most active interest in the Museum since he was connected with the College as a student, and the large practice in which he has been engaged of late years has enabled him to secure’for it very many specimens, and some of them of the greatest interest. His anatomical preparations, also, are very fine, and could hardly be surpassed for the freedom and beauty of the dissections. The most valu- able specimen that has ever been added to the Museum, and probably ever will be,.was given two years ago by Dr. John M. Harlow, of Woburn. It was the skull of the man through whose head a large iron bar passed, and who essentially recov- ered from the accident. For the professional zeal and the energy that Dr. H. showed, in getting possession of this re- markable specimen, he deserves the warmest thanks of the profession, and still more, from the College, for his donation. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the evidence that Dr. H. has furnished, the case seems, generally, to those who have not seen the skull, too much for human belief. The whole number of specimens now in the Museum amounts to three thousand six hundred and eighty-nine. The last specimen is numbered 3681 ; but thirteen were accidentally omitted, and afterwards added as the volume was being printed ; and five were repeated. Of these, one thousand one hundred and six- teen specimens were given by Dr. Warren, including three hundred and thirteen phrenological casts; and one hundred and twenty-three specimens were paid for from the Museum I und. The number of specimens preserved in spirit is nineVI INTRODUCTION. hundred and four; and of these, seven hundred and seven, with one or two exceptions, are separately displayed in glass jars. The rest, after being numbered and classified, are pre- served together in large glass jars, from which they can be removed for study or demonstration.* Some of the dry prepara- tions are also individually preserved under glass or in jars, for security when they are handled, and to make them more secure, also, than they can be when in the glazed cases alone; and, for the same reason, many, if not most, of the arterial preparations are mounted. Of the artistic specimens, there are two hundred and sixty-eight models by Thibert, and sixty- seven by Auzoux, of Paris. The casts in plaster amount to five hundred and seventy ; but these include the phrenological col- lection, of which the number has been given above ; twenty-one of the casts that were taken from recent specimens being colored somewhat after nature. There are also sixty photographs, and one hundred and three other specimens, including drawings, daguerreotypes, wax models, etc. As there are many cue specimens that are preserved, though essentially similar, so there are many others of great interest and of common occur- rence, that are not generally preserved, except in regard to their external form, to the locality in which they are found, 01 their clinical history, - inasmuch as their appearances are en- tirely changed by any mode of preservation that is known. A descriptive catalogue is essential in an anatomical muse- um ; and one has been kept, in which the specimens that were criven by Dr. Warren, and all that have since been added, have been entered as they were received. Many of them are simp y enumerated; but the descriptions are often much detai , though references are made, by volume and page, to the hospi- rSU and to the Medical Journal; it being understood that the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal are referred to, unless othenv.se expressed. Lengthy as the descriptions sometimes are, how- cve‘ Ly are almost always condensed from the or.g.nal reports- and the liberty has always been taken of collecting errors, whenever such were known to exist. In the prin ec catalogue of Thibert’s models many appearances are recoided shown, and they are consequently not referred tm The donor’s name, as a rule, is always given, whatever may * Designated by a mark (.) under tho number.INTRODUCTION. VII his position, and if it is known, which is not always the ease though sometimes it is purposely withheld, and for various reasons; the donor being often the one who made the post- mortem examination, and not the one in whose practice the case occurred, and whose interest in it has not always disposed him to take any trouble in regard to the specimen. When the donor prepared the specimen, the fact has been or should be recorded. Many of the donors, and some of the best friends of the Museum, are now not living; but with a few exceptions, this does not appear. The specimens that are displayed in the cases are, of course, numbered to correspond with the descrip- tive catalogue ; and a memorandum is kept of those that are pieseived together, in spirit, and in the numbered jars. The specimens, also, as they have been entered in the catalogue have been arranged according to a certain system, and briefly enumerated, with a repetition of the numbers and of the names of the donors. The present volume has reached a most unexpected size, and would have been still larger if it had been as openly spaced throughout as it was at first. Figures, however, and o ei inelegant abbreviations are often used, for the sake of brevity; and much is generally left to be inferred in regard to the specimens,-as the mode of preparation, the exhibition of certam parts, the fact that the history of a case was wholly or partially unknown, and generally the fact that a specimen was from the dissecting room.

They are all entered in a second and separate catalogue,INTRODUCTION. April 29, 1870. Till though very much less fully than in the other, but with refer- ences and a systematic index. The Museum contains, for its size, many specimens of interest, and some that can hardly be surpassed. But there are a great many deficiencies; and it is to be hoped that many of them will be supplied by the zeal of the young men who are coming forward, and that the profession generally will continue to contribute, as they have heretofore, until there is no common form of injury or disease that will not be repre- sented in the collection. Since the above was in type, a manuscript “ Catalogue of Preparations, belonging to the Anatomical Cabinet of the Massachusetts Medical College,” has been received from Dr. J. Collins Warren, the son of Dr. J. Mason Warren, and grandson of the founder of the Museum. The date of this catalogue, of which I had never before heard, is not given ; but it bears the marks of age, and, if it could have been consulted whilst the present volume was being prepared, it would have been of little use, as very few of the specimens can be identified ; many are certainly not now in the collection, and it gives very generally little more than a mere enumeration of the specimens.9 TABLE OF CONTENTS FIRST DIVISION. —HEALTHY ANATOMY.

The existence of this fontanelle is inferred, when the foetal head is examined, from the yielding of the parietal bones, and the firmness of the occipital; and one is often made when the skull is prepared, if it is not care- fully stuffed.

Part II. p. 362), that “the frontal sinuses do not make their appearance until fourteen or fifteen years of age, or even in many instances at a still later period.” “ The antrum and the sphenoidal cells, like the frontal sinuses, remain undeveloped during early life.” 1856.

Sections of the neck of the femur, to show how its ana- tomical structure explains the phenomena of extra-capsular fracture, to which it is so liable ; made b}r Dr. Bigelow, and described by him as follows : — “ To exhibit this structure, which has hitherto been un- noticed, sections should be made in the following; man- 7 O ner: — “ A well-developed femur is to be secured, in a nearly vertical position; the axis of the neck being carefully placed in the plane of the horizon. A thin slice is now taken from the top of the neck, including at its extremities the top of the head of the bone, and the top of the great trochanter; this section passing through the neck, in a direction parallel with the plane of the horizon. A sec- ond, third, and fourth slice, each one-fourth of an inch thiclc, are now to be sawed from the neck, parallel with the first. There will now remain, attached to the shaft of the femur, only the lower part of the head, and a narrow lower isthmus of the neck. On examining the cut surface of this last section, it will be found that the anterior wall of the neck is one-eighth of an inch thick, or more, while the posterior wall is of a papery thickness only.10 HEALTIIY ANATOMY. “ It follows that in the usual impaction of the neck of the femur, the anterior Avail refuses to be impacted. The posterior wall, on the contrary, is deeply imbedded into its own substance, offering little or no resistance to the force producing the fracture. The impaction, therefore, takes place exclusively on the posterior aspect of the neck, while the anterior and thick Avail, acting as a hinge at the point of fracture, allows the outward rotation of the shaft, so constantly observed in these cases. “ In making these sections, another anatomical peculi- arity will be observed, provided the bone is healthy, and well developed. This will be best seen in the neAv speci- men. Let the small trochanter, the intertrochanteric line, and the back part of the great trochanter be removed with a fine saw, in one piece. By getting rid of this projecting mass, the back of the neck may be brought into a continu- ous curve with the back of the shaft. The part remoA'ed will be found to be merely a buttress of spongy tissue, built out for the attachment of the muscles, Avhile the true neck of the femur will be discovered beneath the removed portion, uniting the back of the neck continuously with the true shaft below. “ This true neck may be demonstrated by lightly scrap- ing out, with a rougine, the cancellar structure, until the instrument is arrested by the firm wall beneath. This last is the true neck, and offers some slight resistance to the impaction of the posterior Avail. On the last section, in the preparation first described, this true neck will be seen as a very thin line, continuous with the posterior wall of the neck, plunging beneath the intertrochanteric line, or buttress, and passing toAvards a point corresponding Avilh the middle of the outside of the shaft. Before reaching this, however, it loses itself in radiating spokes or fibres, which, though quite slender, seem intended to contribute by their mechanical arrangement, a little towards the strength of the bone. “ After examining these preparations, it will be readily seen why the impaction is so exclusively upon the back of the neck, producing outward rotation, and whj'- it not un- frequently splits off the small trochanter, and the intertro-HEALTIIY ANATOMY. 11 chanteric line, by means of the posterior wall of the neck, which is wedged beneath them. “The impaction here described, is, doubtless, a very fre- quent accident; not uncommonly resulting in complete union at the end of a few months, more frequently occur- ring than the fracture within the capsule, and by no means so grave a lesion as certain authors have considered it. In fact, its only indications, in some cases, are persistent local pain, attended with a veiy slight shortening, and ro- tation outwards of the limb, and of course, without crepitus. “ An additional and important remark should be here made, in relation to the shortening of the limb, which rarely results, in these cases, from the separation of the fragments, but only from the obliquity of the anterior hinge. In illustrating this, it will be seen that, if this hinge were vertical, the neck, thus hinged upon the shaft, would merely rotate around the axis of the shaft, and there would be no shortening ; but, as the hinge is placed at an angle of 45°, the neck rotates not only backwards, but downwards; or, which is the same thing, the shaft ascends, and the whole bone is shortened.” Dr. H.

The other was similarly affected. The father of the child, who was exhibited to the Society for Medical Improvement, by Dr. C., has both clavicles in the same condition; but some- thing like the outer half of these bones was indistinctly felt in connection with the scapula. He stated that two of his brothers had the same malformation ; and he thinks that his father, from the slope of his shoulders, may have had the same. He has had seven boys and two girls ; and all of the boys have had the malformation on one side or both.

O’Connell, the surgeon of the regi- ment, and a former student of Dr. C., to whom the speci- mens were sent, stated that he examined the humeri, with especial reference to the existence of an opening through the fossa, and he believed that the humerus that is here shown was the only one in which it did not exist. Many years ago, Dr. Charles T. Jackson noticed this opening in the humerus of an Indian, from this neighborhood, and subsequently in another from the State of Maine. Dr. J. Wyman has also met with it in the N.

This was met with in the dissecting-room, by Dr. Hodges, and described as follows: — “ Origin has no direct connection with the sternum until it reaches the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs, to which it is attached, giving off also a small strip to the sternum. The upper right slip is continuous with the clavicular portion of the pectoralis ; the under one with the sternal part of same; the left slip is blended with the pec- toralis of that side. At its lower insertion it passes wholly underneath the pectoralis; at its upper part, or origin, it is continuous with the sterno-mastoid. The part of the pectoralis arising from third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages is nearly wanting.”HEALTHY ANATOMY. 26 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

Groux was here, and whose case (bifid condition of the sternum) excited so much interest in this country and in Europe. The object was to. show what different parts of the organ corresponded to certain points in the anterior parietes of the chest. As the subject lay upon the back, long needles were thrust in perpendicularly, as follows : Immediately to the left of the sternum, between the second and third cartila- ges (1) ; between the third and fourth (2) ; and between the fourth and fifth (3). Immediately to the right of the ster- num, between the third and fourth cartilages (4) ; and be-28 HEALTIIY ANATOMY. tween the fourth and fifth (5). Middle of the sternum, between the third cartilages (6) ; and between the fourth (7). Just below the very anterior extremity of the fifth rib, upon the left side (8). The thorax was then opened, and the heart removed without displacing the needles ; and the result was as fol- lows :— No. 1 passed through the left branch of the pul- monary artery ; No. 2, through the pulmonary artery at the upper edge of the valves, and very near to the right side ; and through the left auricle, very near to its appendix; No. 3, through right ventricle \ in. below the pulm. valves, through adherent margin of aortal valves, through upper edge of mitral valve, and through the other side of left auricle, £ in. above the valve ; No. 4, through appendix of right auricle, near the base, junction of upper vena cava and auricle towards left side, and through left auricle very near to pulm. veins; No. 5, through right auricle, anteriorly, one inch above tricuspid valve ; No. 6, through aorta, § in. above valves, midway in regard to the circumference, and through right branch of pulm. artery; No. 7, through ap- pendix of right auricle, aortal valves towards right side, and through the middle of the left auricle; No. 8, through the fat at the apex, and just beneath the pericardium, but without entering the cavities of the heart. After the heart had been examined, strong threads were passed through in the course that the needles took, num- bered 1-8, and tied. 1858. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 277.

Interventricular opening; ductus arteriosus largely open, • and the pulmonary artery entirely closed at its ori- gin. The subject of this case had always been a puny little girl, of small stature, and died of phthisis at the age of four years and four months. From the age of six or eight months, she had always been livid, and particularly on exercise. She was subject, also, to a slight hacking cough, palpitation, and paroxysms of dyspncea ; the breath- ing being rapid, and almost panting when she was asleep. Extremities usually veiy warm, so that she was in the habit of kicking off the bedclothes, and hanging her feet out of the bed to cool them. The ends of the fingers and toes39 HEALTHY ANATOMY. were very markedly clubbed ; and the nails were adunque, very large, and very livid. Dr. T. saw her two weeks before her death, for the first time, and on the occasion of a hsemoptisis, the amount of blood lost being at least a pint. She had once or twice before raised a few bloody sputa; and the day before the hemorrhage she had played out of doors, and rather more actively than usual. Being very irritable, the chest was only examined upon the left side, when she was asleep. The respirations were 80, and strongly puerile ; action of the heart tumultuous; the radial pulse being too feeble to be counted.

His stunted condition (3 ft.), healthy appearance, hap- py expression, and frequent protrusion of the tongue from his half-open mouth were perfectly characteristic. When he closed his mouth the incisor teeth did not meet, but left an elliptical opening, as in the Chimpanzee ; the elbow and knee-joints could not be fully extended, and the calves are seen in the figure to be quite small. His head, which was formed as usual in such cases, and was one of the smallest, seemed to be kept shaved ; and measured, antero-posty. 4£ in., in circumference 14£ in., between the orifices of the ears 3£ in., and from the chin to the vertex 6£ in. The attendant stated that he never made any articulate sounds ; that he had to be attended to every two or three hours for his excretions; that he had hair upon the pubes, and an occasional erection, but he had never known him to have an emission, nor to show any tendency to masturbation. 1862.

Operation with the trocar on the third day ; canula left in for a week, and the opening then dilated with sponge. In six or eight weeks opening enlarged with the knife; and a tube, § in. in diameter, having been introduced, was kept in for about a year. This was occasionally removed ; and, once or twice, when it was obstructed, the faeces passed through the penis ; this being first noticed when the child was about six months’ old. Three or four months before its death, the parents removed the tube without Dr. Y.’s knowledge ; the faeces soon beginning to pass through the penis, and continuing to do so ever afterward. For a time they passed also through the artificial anus, but for the last two months not at all. The child continued quite healthy, and died, at the a^e of eighteen months, from the effects of a fall a few days before. On dissection, some liquid faeces were found in the rec- tum, and a quantity of foreign matter. The intestine it- self was much enlarged, and moderately thickened; but, excepting a little excrescence a few inches above its termination, it was healthy. Opening between the rec- tum and the membranous portion of the urethra just in front of the verumontanum, direct, and about two lines in diameter. The bladder contained some liquid faeces, but was itself perfectly healthy. Through the opening made by Dr. Y., air could be forced before the parts were cut open, but the head of a very small pin would not pass. A piece of whalebone has been passed through the congeni- tal opening, and the parts are fully displayed. Case quo- ted by Mr. Ashton, in his work on Dis. etc., of the Rec- tum, p. 64. 1850. Dr. J. H. York. For a statistical record of one hundred and four cases of “ Anal and Intestinal Malformation,” by Dr. Geo. H. Gay, see Boston Med. & Surg. Jour. Vol. lvii. p. 397.HEALTHY ANATOMY. 67 In cases of imperforate anus, an opening into the “ blad- der” or “ urethra” is occasionally reported ; but, so far as I have seen, an opening into the membranous portion of the urethra is always found in an ordinary case of imper- forate anus in the male subject. In extraordinary cases, or where there is great malformation of the internal organs, the opening maj'- be into the fundus of the bladder, or there may be a great deficiencj’- of the large intestine, and no opening at all. The opening is usually small, but easily enough demonstrated, if the rectum is inflated under water, after washing it out, and opening the bladder and urethra. The above general remark was made, and founded upon the observation of six cases, when the Catalogue of the Med. Society’s Cabinet was published, in 1847 ; and sev- eral others have since been met with. When the anus is imperforate in the female, the rectum opens into the vagina; and this opening seems to corre- spond to that in the male subject, — the membranous portion of the urethra being the genital portion of the urinary canal. In an analysis, by Mr. Curling, of one hundred cases of “ Congenital Imperfections of the Rectum,” with reference to an operation (Med. Chir. Trans. Yol. xltii. p. 270), he gives twenty-six, in which the intestine opened into the urethra, or neck of the bladder ; and he remarks that there were “ very probably more, as the opening is sometimes so minute as to prevent the free escape of meconium during life.” 677. Imperforate anus in a pig, that appeared perfectly healthy, » and was killed on the nineteenth day from birth. The rec- tum ends in a cul-de-sac ; but between one and two inches from its extremity a short, dense, rounded cord connects it with the urethra at about the same distance from the bladder. The bladder and urethra having been cut open, this cord was found to be pervious, though air could not readily be forced through from the rectum. In spirit. One of the other pigs, in the litter of eight or ten, had the anus imperforate, but the others were well formed. In a previous litter, the sow had borne a female, in which theHEALTHY ANATOMY. 68 rectum and vagina liad a common opening ; this last being still alive when the above case was observed, and defeca- tion being perfectly natural. 1850. Dr. Waldo J. Burnett. 678. Imperforate rectum. The pelvic organs were dissected by Dr. R. M. Hodges, and have been preserved in spirit; showing the rectum, distended, and ending in a cul-de-sac, low in the pelvis, and below this a very small portion of intestine with the anus. The child died on the sixth day, crying incessantly the last ten or twelve hours, and with the abdomen very tense and swollen ; but there was no vomiting. The urine was very scanty; and two days before death it was slightly tinged by meconium, though nothing was found, on dis- section, to explain this fact. Case in the practice of Dr. A., and no operation performed ; a female child. Three years previously the mother bore another male child that lived eight days, and in which the meconium passed freely through the penis ; a perfect female having been born meanwhile. 1858. Dr. James Ayer. 679. Imperforate rectum ; intestine distended and dried. Case in Dr. M.’s practice ; a female. Trocar passed in about two inches on the third da}', but without opening the intestine, and it died on the fifth. Symptoms not urgent.

On the fourth da}' a trocar • was thrust in, and meconium was freely discharged. The next morning a piece of gum-elastic catheter was passed up upon a probe; in the evening, as nothing had passed, the opening was enlarged with the knife, and a small quan- tity of meconium escaped. Death on the following day. On dissection, it was found that the probe and catheter had passed into the cellular tissue by the side of the in- testine, and that there was an opening into the peritoneal cavity. 1869.69 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 681. Rectum opening into the vagina. When the child was six weeks old, Dr. W. made an incision into the intestine, in the situation of the anus, drew it down, and stitched its margin to the integuments. The operation was perfectly successful; solid feces passing through the artificial open- ing, and the liquid portion through the vagina. An opera- tion for the closure of the opening into the vagina was de- ferred on account of the age of the child, and it died when about sixteen months old. On dissection, a malposition of the large intestine was found ; and a sharp flexure had produced an obstruction that sufficiently explained the death. The rectum having been cut open along the back, by Dr. W., there is seen an opening into the vagina that would admit the tip of the little finger; the intestine just above this being much con- tracted, and plaited upon the inner surface. The anal opening made by the operation seems to have been of good size. (Med. Jour. lxxi. 243.) Dr. J. M. Warren. 682. Rectum ends in a cul-de-sac ; distended and dried.

The end of the prepuce was re- moved ; and then, as it could not be retracted, a long and ineffectual attempt was made to dissect it from the glans. In relation to this case, I subsequently examined a great many subjects, and have never yet seen one in which the prepuce could be retracted, so as to expose the glans to the extent of more than one or two lines. Further, the prepuce has generally, if not always, been adherent to the glans, if the subject was a fresh one ; the adhesion being much more than a mere gluing together of the surfaces, though it could be easily enough separated by a pointed probe. The above conditions remain for some time after birth, but at what period they cease, I have not ascertained. It is remarkable that paraphymosis sometimes exists, it is said, at birth. (Med. Jour.

The testicles were in place. An operation for its relief was performed by Dr. Cabot, at the hospital (136, 12 ; and Med. Jour. April 2, 1868), but the child died from the effects. On dissection, the parts were well formed, excepting the penis. 1868. Museum Fund. 734. Organs of a malformed foetus.

The breasts resembled those of a virgin female, and the penis measured only 14 in. in length, and in. in diameter. An opportunity having been procured, by the kindness of Dr. Brinkerhoff, Surgeon, U. S. N., to examine this individual, the following obser- vations were made : Skin delicate as an infant’s ; contour of limbs remarkably feminine ; no trace of beard; some hair upon the pubes. Gians penis feels rather large, and can be about one-half uncovered by retraction of the pre- puce, when this last is arrested as if by an adhesion to the organ ; urethra quite normal, and he can pass a full stream of water ; scrotum very imperfectly developed ; one testi- cle very indistinctly felt, upon the left side, and toward the ring. The individual states that the penis is capable of erection, but that he has scarcely ever had any sexual feeling, and that he has never had connection with a fe- male ; that he had never polluted himself, nor ever had a seminal discharge. 1864.

The left half of the scrotum is entirely wanting; the right half containing a body about twice as large as the testicle, and partially divided so as to feel like a testis and epidydimis. The penis was very short, with an imperfect prepuce, and resembled an enlarged clitoris; the meatus urin. being at the root of the organ. Hair upon the pubes sufficient. See next specimen.

At the age of one year and eleven months menstruation commenced, and has continued regularly since; and about the same time the breasts and hips began to enlarge. During the last year she has been in this city, on a visit, and was seen by many of the medical profession; Dr. Gay having seen the menstrual fluid as it was being discharged. There is hair over the pubes, and in the axillm. One of the breasts is shown in the photograph, and is seen to be quite large;.■ and the hips, which measure 27£ in. in circumference, are so large as to amount almost to a deformity. Her general health is perfect. The first set of teeth is complete, but none of them have begun to loosen. Her manners and tastes are those of a child of her age; and she has never, so far as her mother is aware, shown any sexual feeling. The photograph was taken when she was two years and eight months old. An account of her case, which, how- ever, has not been seen here, was published by Dr. John King, in the Medical Journal at Cincinnati, in 1868. 1869. Dr. Benj. E. Cottincj.

Dr. Francis Minot. 818. Cast, in plaster, of the head and chest of a foetus (Nosen- cephalus of St. H.) ; taken by an Italian, and colored by a German artist. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. Walsh, who stated that the labor was rather premature, the quantity of liquor amnii large, and that the child lived about thii^-six hours; having been born on Tuesday, at 11 P.M. The mother refused to nurse it; but it sucked the finger, and took, during the first eighteen hours, about two ounces of milk and water, swallowing well. Pulse distinct; warmth sufficient, and there was a discharge of urine and freces. Convulsions began on Wednesday, at 6 P. M., and con- tinued till death, which occurred on Thursday, at 10 P. M. The weight of the foetus was 7 lbs. The vault of the cranium and the integument being wanting, there rested upon the base a deep red, purplish tumor, of a flattened, spherical form, with lobulated edges, and measuring 2x2| in. and 1 in. in thickness ; during life it was, of course, larger. The extension of the cuticle, as usual, for some distance over the mass, and beyond the limits of the cutis is finely shown on the cast. On dissection, it consisted of a coarse, fibro-cellular, and vascular tissue, but without a trace of brain, though some of the nerves were found. Otherwise, the foetus was well-formed externally; and in- ternally, except that the renal capsules were very small, as usual in the “ acephalous foetus.” See next specimen. 1859. Museum Fund. 819.

A second cranium, in which the posterior portion of the occiput extends from side to side, and is formed of two pieces that are closely connected inferiorly, but not superi- orly ; the upper edge being about on a level with the base of the skull. The frontal bones are very deficient, but send a prolongation backward, which, upon the left side reaches the occiput. Upon the right side there is between it and this last, a small, irregular bone, which is the only represen- tative of a parietal. The spine was well-formed. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. M., who reported that the mother was married in October, 1858 ; that she always menstruated regularly, twice after her marriage, and for the last time on the 9 th of December; that motions were first felt, indistinctly, in May, and that the child was born on the 7th of November, or eleven months, less two days, fiom the last catamenial period. The ear pre- sented. The foetus weighed 7-fc lbs.; and, from its long limbs, and lobust appearance, low forehead, and swollen eyes and face, it suggested strongly the idea of an English prize- fighter after a battle ; and, again, the broad and flat ears, standing directly off from the head, as they would not if the malformation extended to the neck, suggested the idea, as seen from behind, of a Chimpansee. Upon the base of the skull there was a considerable quantity of cellulo- vascular tissue, but no trace of brain. The pituitary body was found as usual. The spinal marrow bulged at the upper extremity, and about where the pons varolii would have commenced ; and from this part, and below it, several * nerves arose. 1865. Dr. E. D. Miller, of Dorchester. St. Hilaire states (Anom. de rOrganisation, Vol. ir. p. 339), that his father and M. Ser res once found the pituitary gland in a pseudencephalus, which is one form of the “acephalous foetus;” but in his description of the anen- cephalus, which is another form of the same, he makes no allusion to it. On the other hand, I found it many years ago, as I presume that others have ; and from the time that I saw St. II.’s remark, I have never failed to find it, and in numerous cases, when I have looked for it.HEALTHY ANATOMY. 89 821.

Dr. J. C. Warren. 822. A second specimen, very similar to the last, but without the appearance of brain; the malformation, also, extends no further than the upper part of the neck. Sex, female. This form of monstrosity is fully described in the Cata- logue of the Med. Society’s Cabinet (p. 247). 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 822£. A third specimen, similar to the last, and that, having been for a time preserved entire in spirit, was afterward removed and dried ; and now strikingly resembles one that is figured by St. Hilaire (Anom. de l’Org.), and that was found in the Egyptian catacombs. 1868. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. A very similar malformation is shown in a “ Double- headed ” Duck, No. 900. 823. A fourth specimen, preserved entire. The cranial and spinal cavities are open as far as the sacrum. Brain wanting; but, in the recent state, there were appearances of spinal marrow in the form of two flat and very thin bands, about two lines in width, and lying side by side, if they were not fused ; toward the upper part these bands were thicker, and quite distinct. Spinal nerves not ex- posed. Upon the base of the skull there was a considera- ble quantity of cellulo-vascular tissue, but nothing that could be called a tumor. There was no neck ; the ears were doubled down, with a narrow margin of hair about the base of the skull, as usual, and the eyes were promi- nent and turned upward, so as to give it the characteristic appearance of a large bull-frog. Labor was premature, judging from the size of the foetus, which presented b}' the feet, and was still-born. Quantity of liquor amnii very profuse, as it usually is, more or less. The mother had previously had three well-formed children ; and never felt the motions of this last. 1853. Dr. Win. E. Townsend.90 healthy anatomy. 824. A fifth specimen, preserved entire.

Warren. 825. Separated cranial bones, with the cervical vertebra, from a foetus similar to No. 822. For a description of the oste- ology in this form of monstrosity, see the Med. Soc.’s Cata- logue, p. 248. The upper maxillaries are co-ossified ; and the large wings of the sphenoid are united to the body of the bone. In the dissection of this case, some small cellulo-vascular tumors were found about the base of the skull, but no brain. Pituitary body distinct. Spinal marrow terminated in the membranes. Otherwise well-formed externally ; and so internally, excepting a very strongly marked fissure of the uvula, and the extremely small renal capsules. The mother was a respectable woman, and had had other and well-formed children. Early in her pregnancy she was much frightened by a serpent, and often expressed an anxiety as to the effect upon her child ; and, as soon as it was born, asked her physician if all was right. Motions had been very active. Labor occurred at seven or seven and one-half months ; the back and shoulder presented, and the quantity of liquor amnii was prodigious. Sex, male. 1849. j)r. jm g. £, Jackson. 826. Separated bones of the head of an acephalous foetus. There are two parietals, which is very unusual in this vari- ety of monstrosity, but they are very thin and delicate; the right is If in. in length, and to 3 lines in diameter; . the left is smaller. The two halves of the lower maxillary bone are fused ; and this is exceedingly rare, so far as I have seen. There is fusion, also, of the two upper maxil- laries ; of the body and wings of the sphenoid bone upon the left side; and of all the parts of each temporal bone. The posterior portion of the occiput is divided and formed *as usual in these cases, excepting the narrow pro-91 HEALTHY ANATOMY. longation that bounds the base of the skull; and this last is very short. The subject was a male, 18£ in. in length, and weighing 5 lbs. 4A oz. No trace of brain was found ; and the head was as usual in such cases. Penis rather deficient. Oth- erwise, well-formed externally ; and so internally, except- ing the very small size of the renal capsules. Motions of the child very active and powerful during the last two months of pregnancy, the period of which was about nine months. Foetus sent, April, 1868, by Dr. Geo. Vining, of Pittsfield. 827.

Liquor amnii profuse. Head presented. A female, and gasped after birth. 1861. Dr. A. P. Richardson. 828. Cranium and spine from another case, in which the fissure extends to the sixth dorsal vertebra. The laminae of the cervical vertebrae are imperfectly developed, and co-ossified into two masses upon each side. The bodies of the same are very irregularly placed, and there are one or two more than usual; one, that connects with the three last laminae, upon the right side, and with that of the first dorsal, being not above the body that connects with the two first dorsal laminae upon the left side, but to the right of it. Labor at seven and one-half months, and the brow pre- sented ; the prominent ejms feeling like two bullets. Fe- male, and' still-born. Dr. W. W. Morland, who reported the case, found the renal capsules small, but the other organs of the thorax and abdomen well-formed. 1860. Dr. Stephen Ball. 829. Cranium and trunk of a foetus, in which the first is defi- cient, as in the above cases, and the fissure of the spine extends to the middle of the lumbar region. There is also an antero-posterior curvature of the cervi- cal upon the dorsal vertebrae, with some fusion of the lam- inae of the first.92 healthy anatomy. Age about seven months; and sex, female. No trace found of brain or spinal marrow; the nerves of this last last seeming to connect only with the membranes. Renal capsules very small, and united across the spine. Other- wise nothing unusual, excepting a fissure of the soft and hard palate. 1856. Dr. Alfred Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 830. Cranium and trunk; the fissure extends to the sacrum, and there is a strong antero-posterior curvature of the cer- vical upon the upper part of the dorsal portion of the spine. Ihe wings of the cervical vertebrae are extensively fused upon the left side, and the bodies of the vertebrae at the curvature are irregularly developed. Eleven ribs upon each side; extensively fused upon the left, and somewhat so upon the right side. Labor at about seven and one-half months, and the quantity of liquor amnii large. Weight of the foetus, 1 lb. 14£ oz., and length, 11£ in. 1864. Dr. John 0. Green, of Lowell. 831. Cranium and trunk; the fissure extending to the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Antero-posterior curvature such that the two halves of the posterior portion of the occiput rest directly upon the wings of the sixth dorsal vertebra. The bodies of the three last dorsal vertebrae are well-formed ; that of the ninth is triangular, with its apex upward, whilst those of the other vertebrae are formed in about equal and lateral halves, quite regularly in the dorsal por- tion, but being more imperfectly developed in the cervical. These lateral halves are then separated, and an opening is the result, that is half an inch in diameter. The three or four last of these divided bodies of the dorsal vertebrae are fused upon each side. The laminae of the cervical vertebrae are also fused, and almost throughout, upon each side. The mother had previously had four children, well- formed. Motions felt in the present case, as usual. La- bor at seven and one-half months. Quantity of liquor amnii very great. Knee presented, with the cord hanging from the vagina. Child a male, and still-born. During her pregnancy the mother was so much frightenedHEALTHY ANATOMY. 93 by a snake as to faint; felt at once that her child would be “marked” — tried to forget it, but could not, and “ often ” spoke of it to her friends. Weight of the child, 24 lbs. In the thickened pia mater, and toward the frontal bone, was a small serous cyst, and near it a trace of brain. Pituitary body, as usual. In the posterior mediastinum were several organs ; the stom- ach of an elongated form, receiving the bile-duct near one extremity, and the intestine arising from the other near the opening of the oesophagus ; the small intestine, about 13 in. in length, and of which a portion passed through the opening in the spinal column, and appeared upon the back of the child as a mass about as large as the top of the thumb; a diverticulum arose from this last portion of in- testine, 1 in. in length, and 4 inches from the stomach; the pancreas aud spleen, with a small mass accessory to this last. The oesophagus was, of course, quite short. Before the dissection the protruded intestine was invested b}7 a membrane about as thick as the spinal theca would have been, and to which it was somewhat adherent; there were also extensive adhesions to the mediastinum. The opening in the diaphragm, through which the organs passed, was near the spine, and small. Renal capsules exceedingly small. Large intestine 8 in. in length. Lungs small, and very imperfectly divided into lobes. Uvula slightly bifid. 1858. Dr. Isaac F. Galloupe, of Lynn. 832. The head and upper part of the trunk of a foetus, very similar to No. 822, but complicated with a double hare- lip ; in spirit. The spine being so nearly entire, the neck was well-marked.

Upon the base of the94 HEALTHY ANATOMY. skull, and overlying the spine to a considerable extent, was a mass of brain, which had the capacity, by measure- ment, of nearly one ounce and a half; convolutions marked, with some appearances of a cavity, but having no appreci- able connection with the spinal marrow. This last appeared in the form of two longitudinal, and moderately thick ribbons, each about one-third of an inch in width, and nearly or quite separated upon the median line ; the nerves being given off from it anteriorly, and along its whole length. For the appearances of the face, see next speci- men. Internal organs well formed, excepting the renal capsules, but these were hot so small as usual in the “acephalous foetus.” Sex, female. The left lower ex- tremity was much shortened and everted ; the head of the femur being dislocated, and lying near the ant. inf. process of the ilium; upper margin of the acetabulum entirely wanting, but its cavity was of considerable depth, though nearly filled with fat, of which there was none upon the other side.; round ligament considerably thickened. The left knee-joint was also partially dislocated ; the con- dyles of the femur projecting strongly backward, and the leg making an angle forward upon the thigh. 1860. Dr. J. Wyman. 834. Cranium of the above monstrosity; prepared by Dr. J. Wyman, who gave the following description of it, and of a median fissure that existed in the upper lip. Dr. N. C. Parker, of Farmington, N. H. “ The appearances presented b}r the cranium are such as are often met with in anencephalous foetuses, and in addi- tion, the following appearances were noticed. The eyes were' separated only by a very slight interval, so that the inner angles nearly touched. The lids having been arrested in an early stage of development, formed merely a narrow border, incapable of covering the globe. The nostrils were imperforate, though the nasal cavities were normally developed. The mouth was of a triangular shape, with a truncated apex; the upper lip consists of three portions, the right and left converging upwards, and a transverse portion above connecting them. In these particulars the95 HEALTHY ANATOMY. fissure is unlike a lateral one, where the two sides of it converge to a point. There was a deep notch in the re- gion of the incisive teeth, but no fissure in the roof of the mouth. “ The inner orbitar processes of the frontal bone had an unusual length; the nasal bones were wanting, and the ascending portions of the upper jaw met on the median line, thus closing the nasal cavities above. The alveolar border of the upper jaw contained on each side four cavi- ties for teeth, namely, two for molars, one for a canine and one for a lateral incisor, in all eight. The middle incisors were wanting, and their places occupied by the median notch. Behind each of the incisive alveoli are traces of the intermaxillary suture, but that on the right was most distinct. “ A fissure in the upper lip, on the middle line, is quite rare. Leuckart, Yrolik, and Von Ammon have each de- scribed one. The existence of it is admitted by Rokitan- sky, Meckel, and others. Leuckart and Vrolik believe it to be dependent upon, and always co-existing with, a defect of the intermaxillary bone, which opinion is supported by the specimen here described, where the bone in question is partly wanting. (See Vrolik Tabulae acl Illustrandum Embryogenum. Amst., 1849. Tab. xxxiii. Fig. 7.) “ In the close approximation of the eyes, in the absence of nasal bones, and in the partial deficiency of the inter- maxillary bone, this specimen shows a tendency to cj'-clop- ism. In cyclopian monsters, in addition to the fusion of eyes and closure of nostrils, there is always absence of the intermaxillary. “ The malformation hei’e noticed is not, properly speak- ing, a fissure in the same sense that the lateral fissures are. There is naturally no fissure on the median line, in any stage of development, since the intermaxillary bud occu- pies the middle and is single, and never subdivided into two portions. If, however, the intermaxillary bud is not developed, the maxillary buds, as the}" push towards the middle, if the}" do not reach it, will leave an unoccupied space between them, which will account for the so-called fissure.”96 IIEALTITY ANATOMY. 835 A blighted, anencephalous foetus. Preserved entire. Brain and spinal marrow wanting throughout. Head bent permanently toward the left shoulder, and directly contin- uous with it. Extremities malformed ; the upper half of each arm being fused with the side of the body ; each ra- dius is flexed nearly to a right angle, and apparently dis- located at the upper extremity, and one of the ulnae seemed to be wanting. The legs are permanently flexed upon the thighs, and the fingers and toes are deficient. The length of the specimen is 2% in., and the general appearance is characteristic of the “blighted foetus.” One child had been born, and Dr. B. was called to remove a diseased and adherent placenta. The mother considered herself as four or five months pregnant. 1862. Dr. John G. Blalce. 836. Cranium and trunk prepared. Differs somewhat from the common anencephalus ; and resembles Nos. 783-8 in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet. The frontal portion of the frontal bones is nearly as large as the thumb-nail, and bent down into contact with the body of the sphenoid bone. Behind the frontals are the parietals, of which the left is small, and the right not more than a line in width. The posterior portions of the occiput are also very small, and rest upon the extremities of the laminae of the upper dorsal vertebrae. The cervical portion of the spine is very much curved upon the upper half of the dorsal, so that the face looks directly upward, but with a very marked lateral inclination toward the right side of the cervical vertebrae. The bodies are very irregularly developed, and much fused, as are also the laminae on each side. The dorsal laminae are also somewhat fused. But the most striking point in this skel- eton is a union, Upon the median line, of the seventh and eighth dorsal laminae, whilst the rest of the spine is open throughout; those above and below, of course gradually approximating. The ribs upon each side are well-devel- oped, but considerably fused; eleven on the left side, and ten on the right; one of these last being probably lost. A seven months’ foetus. There were some appearances97 HEALTHY ANATOMY. of brain ; but, microscopically, Dr. Ellis found none of its characteristics. 1866. Dr. Royal S. Warren, of Waltham. 837. Skeleton and trunk, prepared by insects. Cranium very imperfectly developed. The frontal and parietal bones, however, are large enough to extend over the whole base of the skull, but so depressed as to touch the left, and nearly touch the right clinoid process, and to leave the cavity posteriori}7 very small; upper surfaces concave. The depth of the orbits, in consequence of the develop- ment of the frontal bones is quite marked, as compared with their shallowness in the more common form of “ aceph- alous foetus” (No. 821, etc.), in which last these bones are so. very narrow. The posterior portion of the occiput is formed in a single piece, with a thick and round- ed edge inferiorly, and arched upward so as to be only about one-fourth of an inch in width, on the median line. The lateral portions are well developed, as usual, but spread apart so as to make with the posterior portion an occipital foramen that measures 1 in. laterally, and f in. in the opposite direction. The palate is fissured to just be- hind the alveoli. The spine is open throughout, and curved sharply backward at the junction of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. Laminae of the four last cervical vertebrae upon each side fused, and upon the left with those of the three upper dorsal; an anomalous bone, and of some size, being also connected Avith the extremities of these last. Most of the ribs are more or less irregularly developed, and many of them are fused, posteriorly ; there being, besides the usual number, one upon each side, which is considerably developed, and must be regarded as cervical.. Age of foetus about seven months'. Motions quite strong until the last week or two. One foot presented, and the cord was wound around the other leg. Still-born. Quantity of liquor amnii large. There were several de- formed persons in her neighborhood, by whom the mother' was strongly impressed ; “ made herself nearly sick, wor- ryingi from a fear that her child would be deformed, and stated her fears many times to her husband.” > 798 HEALTHY ANATOMY. The foetus weighed 1 lb. 11£ oz., and was 11 in. in length. Diaphragm wanting upon the left side, and the stomach, spleen, small intestine, and large intestine, as far as the left side, were in the left thoracic cavity. Left lung small, and undivided. Right lung of full size ; one lobe, but with a fissure at base. Renal capsules very small. Fissure through whole of soft palate. 1866. Dr. H. C. Bickford, of Charlestown. 838. Foetus; in spirit. The cranial cavity is capacious; but, the spine being much bent, the whole head is thrown back- ward so that the occipital region is closely connected with the lower dorsal vertebrae. Over the lower part of the spine the cutis was to a considerable and definite extent nearly or quite wanting, though the cuticle seemed well developed. The amount of brain was large, but the spinal marrow was not distinctly seen. The deformity was great, from the shortness of the trunk, the protrusion of the chest, the entire absence of the neck, the throwing back of the head, and none the less from the fully developed extremities. Integuments of the lower part of the abdo- men were quite oedematous. The skeleton, if prepared, would probably resemble one (No. 788) that is figured in the Catalogue of the Med. Society’s Cabinet. The renal capsules, which were not so small as in the more common form of “ acephalous foetus,” were fused (See No. 839), as the kidneys also were. The ventricles of the heart com- municated, and the two branches of the pulmonary artery arose from the aorta. A few other malformations were noticed, but they were slight. 1856. Dr. John E. Hathaway, of Worcester. 839. Fusion of the renal capsules ; from the last case. 1856. Dr. Hathaway. St. Hilaire (Hist, des Anom. n. 543) quotes a case of fusion of the r. capsules, and remarks that there is no other on record; two, however, are reported in the catalogue above referred to (Nos. 762, 788), and another has been met with here (No. 829), besides those and the present case. — Feb. 1870, a fifth case.99 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 840.

Dr. E. Leigh. 842. An acephalous and rhinencephalous foetus. The upper lip has a contracted and somewhat cicatrized look ; and about an inch above it are two eyes fused; the iris of each is distinct, and the inner canthus is upon the median line. The nose, or proboscis, is ^ in.- above the eyes ; § in. long, J in. in diameter, and with an orifice at the extremity that opens into a cavity of considerable size. Ears bent per- manently forward; and neck quite wanting. The brain about equals a hen’s egg in bulk, and is covered by arach- noid. Spinal column open to about the lumbar vertebrae ; and with traces, apparently, of spinal marrow. Otherwise well formed, externally. Sex, female. Weight, 1 lb. 8£ oz. Upon the left side the diaphragm was wanting, and the greater part of the alimentary canal, with the spleen, was in the left pleural cavity. Left lung small. Renal capsules rather larger than usual in the acephalous foetus; and, otherwise, the organs seemed to be well formed. 1868. 843.

The patient was a male infant, that entered the Hospital (81,225) under the care of Dr. H. J. Bigelow. The tumor, that seemed to arise from the bridge of the nose by a sort of neck, and about which last the skin had its natural appearance, was about as large as a hen’s egg, at birth, but had increased100 HEALTHY ANATOMY. much in size. A double ligature was applied by Dr. B.; cerebral symptoms came on, and it died with the most in- tense meningitis on the fourteenth day. The anterior horn of the right ventricle extended down- ward in the direction of the tumor, and was lost in the re- mains of the base of it. The cranium, having been pre- pared by insects, shows a regular and nearly circular open- ing, corresponding to the site of the tumor, and resulting from a deficiency in the frontal bones, and a depression of the bones below the tumor; the nasals being broad and nearly horizontal in their position. The orbital cavities are large, and directed outward, and are quite distinct from the above opening; the nasal processes of the maxillary bones nearly uniting with the frontals to form the lateral margin of the opening. Orbital portion of the frontal bones quite prominent within the cranial cavity. The sphenoidal fissures are quite large, and there are some ir- regularities of development dependent upon the formation of the opening in the skull; but otherwise this last is well formed. 1859.

A cast, in plaster, of the back of the head of a foetus, and in which the membranes of the brain protruded through an opening in the upper part of the occiput, and upon the median line ; forming a deep red, shining, and fleshy mass, of a rounded form, and quite as large as the last joint of the thumb. On dissection, nothing unusual was discov- ered in the brain, so far as exposed by a separation of the sagittal suture ; but the continuity of the membranes into the external mass was quite distinct. The abdomen was unusually enlarged, and owing to the great size of the kid- neys. T^he other organs were well formed. Sex, female. Feet affected with varus.

It is sufficiently capa- cious, but rather flattened, and the bones are not fully'- developed. The opening in the occiput is about large enough to allow the thumb to pass. 1862. Dr. T. E. Francis, of Brookline. 848. Cranium of a foetus that most remarkably resembled the above, and that, by a singular coincidence, was also born in the practice of Dr. F. The tumor formed b}r the mem- branes, over the upper part of the occiput, was nearly as large as the top of the finger; and, having been lacerated, a probe passed readily into the cranial cavity ; the brain not being involved. From the very low and retreating forehead, the cranium somewhat resembles that of the Caribs. Lower edge of the opening in the occiput thick and rounded ; and the occipital foramen is also enlarged by a deficiency in the occiput upon the median line. The kidneys, in this case, also, were so greatly enlarged as to be distinctly felt before the abdomen was opened; one weighed 5^ oz., the other oz., and the measurements ' were in proportion. Great numbers of cysts, throughout, and about the size of mustard-seed. Dr. Ellis found, microscopically, “ healthy tubuli; tubuli of which the con- tents were granular, and dilated tubuli containing some granular matter. The walls of the cysts were fibrous, and the contents perhaps a little granular.” The pelvis and infundibula were small, but perfectly well marked ; and one of the ureters was easily inflated to near the bladder, where it was cut off. The bladder would not have held more than three or four drops of fluid. The foetus was quite plump, and measured 15^ in. ; im- perfect varus. Sex, female. (Med. Jour, lxxii. 82.) 1^65. Dr% T. E.

It is flattened, somewhat like a Carib’s, but there is no bone particularly malformed, ex- cepting the posterior portion of the occiput, which, upon the median line, is very deeply and broadly fissured poste- riorly or superiorly, and also, though less broadly, ante- riorly or interiorly.

A large pendulous tumor, that was successfully removed, • in a case of spina bifida. “The child was born on the 4th of January, at the full period, well developed, and well formed externally, except- ing the tumor and a slight varus of one foot. The tumor hung, like a pendulous polypus, from over the vertebral column, and about on a line ■with the crest of the ilia. It had a peduncle, which was about a foot in length, and about as large as the little finger, but enlarging somewhat just before it joined the body of the tumor. This last was nearly the size of two fists, of a rounded form, but taper- ing toward the peduncle, fleshy to the feel, and fluctuating, but not tense ; the surface had the smooth, shining appear- ance, and there was the absence of cutis, that is seen in spina bifida. Upon the peduncle the cutis was well developed, and it terminated abruptly where the body ofHEALTHY ANATOMY. 103 the tumor began. Immediately after the birth of the child a ligature was applied to the peduncle, as near as possible to its origin, and it was then divided ; but the ligature slipped, and there followed a hemorrhage which was very nearly fatal. It did well, however, and it has continued to thrive until the present time (May 20). The peduncle being found to have a large central cavity, a catheter was passed into it, but not into the body of the tumor, and a few teaspoonfuls of clear serum escaped, which, on being heated, coagulated to the degree of solidification ; a liga- ture was then applied to prevent any further escape. At first there seemed to be a considerable deficiency of bone at the origin of the peduncle ; and for the first two months the cicatrized surface bulged out quite perceptibly when the child cried. The opening, however, has gradually con- tracted, and an irregularity of surface is now onty to be felt upon pressing down upon the vertebrae; the remains of the peduncle being about one-fourth of an inch in length.” The cavity of the tumor contained a little dirty fluid, and was lined by a serous membrane. Parietes from £ to ^ in. in thickness, and many cysts were exposed upon the cut surface ; the intervening tissue being lax but tough. The long peduncle had shrunk to 2£ in. in length, and, having been cut open throughout, its inner surface presented no appearance of a lining membrane, but rather that of com- mon integument. The cavity of the peduncle was about one-sixth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and with con- siderable difficulty a small probe was passed down into the cavity of the tumor. The opening into this last was about where the tumor began to taper toward the peduncle ; and it was not direct, but just within the orifice of another adjoining canal, that was about three-fourths of an inch in length, and large enough to admit a probe about two lines in diameter. Upon the inner surface of the peduncle, and closely connected with it, by a lax cellular tissue, are two or three quite large nerves, and a large blood-vessel, which are gradually lost within the tapering portion of the tumor ; the hemorrhage above referred to being thus explained. 1829. Dr. Elisha Huntington, of Lowell.104 HEALTHY ANATOMY. Mr. T. I-Iolmes, in his late work on the Surgical Treat- ment of the Dis. of Infancy and Childhood, refers to this unique case, as it seems to be, and questions whether it was leaih one of spina bifida; but there can be no reasonable doubt in regard to it; and Dr. Hodges, who reviewed the work of Mr. H. (Med. Jour. July 1, 1869), and has ex- amined the specimen, coincides in this last opinion. Mr. II. thinks the C}Tst multilocular; but it was mainly one large cavity, and the cysts in the parietes were quite small. He also severely criticises the statement that the peduncle was “ about a foot in length” at the time of birth ; but I could sooner believe that it had shrunk to 2J in. after the depending weight was taken off, and it had lain for several months in spirit, than that so reliable a person as Dr. Huntington could have much overstated the fact. Unfortu- nately, Dr. H. is now not living, and I have been unable to get any further information in regard to the case. 853. Pelvis, with the integument, etc., from an unusual case of • spina bifida; in spirit. From a foetus, at the term; the arm presented, and it lived about half an hour. Over the lower part of the sacrum was a tumor, about half as large as a nutmeg, of a flattened form, and covered bjr health}' skin. A rounded, fibrous cord ran from this to the spinal canal; and, this last being cut open, the spinal marrow was found to be continued nearly to the tumor; as it is to the sac in a common spina bifida, where this last is below the formation of the cauda equina. As usually hap- pens in this variety of the malformation, the posterior laminae of the last sacral vertebrae were irregularly devel- oped. The penis was quite deficient, and the urethra terminated at some distance from the extremity. Stomach quite large, and the duodenum, terminating in a cul-de-sac just before it received the bile-duct, was distended to the size of a large nutmeg. Intestine well till it reached the bladder, when it opened into that organ, and then, standing off from it at a right angle, tapered off like an appendix, f in. long. Over the front of the sacrum were two thin, firm, rounded, serous cysts, i in. or more in diameter, and not105 HEALTHY ANATOMY. communicating with each other, nor with any of the organs. The right testis was in the scrotum, and the left in the ab- domen ; and a vas deferens joined that of the left, about midway, coming from what looked like, but was found mi- croscopically not to be, a third testis. Kidnej's about as large as usual, but the bladder was exceedingly small, and the urethra was scarcely pervious. Dr. James W. Dobbins, of Uxbridge. The above case was published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lix. p. 355), with nine others, more or less similar to it, that have occurred here, and six others that I have seen in the museums of Europe ; and to these may now be added the following case. 854. A second case. The sac was nearly, or quite as large as two fists, consisted of integument, lined by a serous mem- brane, and contained § x or xii of serum ; opening from spinal canal quite marked. The two elbows, and the or- gans of the abdomen presented; the child being most remarkably doubled up. The abdominal parietes were entirely wanting. The bladder was formed in two cavities, that communicated freely near the neck; and one of them communicated almost throughout with the rectum ; this last opening near the line of the integument. Eight kidney in a state of hydronephrosis, and very large, as well as the ureter, which ended in a cul-de-sac, near the bladder. Left kidney, and renal capsules normal. Upon each side, and at some dis- tance apart, was one-half of a uterus, with its tube, and one-half of a vagina, perfectly symmetrical; cut open upon one side, and shows the os tine®. Ovaries not found ; trace of external labia ; pubic bones widely separ- ated, as in extroversion of the bladder. Thoracic organs well. The preparation shows the sac, and the termination of the spinal marrow. 1854. Dr. D. M. Hodges. 855. Pelvic organs, from the above case. 1854. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 856-7. Photographs of the patient, showing a back and sideHEALTHY ANATOMY. 106 view of a tumor over the sacrum, that “ looked not unlike an immense hydrocele.” She was a little girl, born August 5th, 1857; and the mother states that the tumor, when first discovered, was not larger than the tip of the little finger. When the photographs were taken, in May, 1867, it measured 12 in. around the base, 20 J in. in its greatest circumference, and about 6 in. in height. July 2d, 1869, the base measured 14<t in., and the greatest circumference 25£ in. The skin, which is continuous over it, is generally so thick that the fluid is not seen through it; but in some places it is so thin and transparent that it looks as if it might burst at any time, and this thinness was more marked at the last date than at the first. When in bed, the tumor is less tense, “ and if she turns upon it for a moment the brain suffers.” She is a very largely devel- oped child, weighing 90 lbs. in May, 1867, and 120 lbs. in July, 1869. Menstruated when she was a little over eleven years of age, and the breasts are “ immense for a child.” The above facts were sent by the attending physician, Dr. James Orne Whitney, of Pawtucket, P. I. 1869. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 858. A fourth case; cast in plaster of the lower part of the back, to show the tumor. The patient was a healthy- looking girl, twenty-three years of age, and had always been more or less under the care of Dr. J. L. Chandler, of St. Albans, Vt. The tumor consisted of a solid mass of flesh, centring over the sacrum, ill-defined, irregularly rounded, and about 8 in. in diameter, and 3 in. in elevation ; the integument over it being perfectly healthy. At birth it was half as large as a goose-egg, and not, as it usually is, over the median line; integument at prominent part very thin, and toward the end of the first year it was punctured several times, and discharged a little fluid. It grew from that time with her growth, but for the past seven years had been stationary. There had always been partial loss of sensibility and muscular power, so that she was obliged to use crutches ; and until the last seven years the excretions had been involuntary. The lower extremities were of course much wasted; the feet were affected107 HEALTHY ANATOMY. with varus, and there had also been disease of the bones of the feet from childhood, and sores upon the hip for eight years. Occasionally she had pain in the tumor, and at the same time in the head ; and at any time in the head if she lay upon the tumor. About two years after this cast was taken, she fell from a horse, and received a severe blow upon the tumor, which enlarged to two or three times its previous size, and threatened to slough; and about four years after the fall she died. 1857. Museum Fund. 859. A fifth case; preparation of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, to show the wide separation of the sacral laminae. From a healthy little girl, seven years of age. Congen- ital tumor over the sacrum. Upon admission into the Hos- pital (115, 124) it was 16£ in. in circumference, at the base; projected 5 in., and was of an ovoid form; tense, fluctuating, covered by integument, but in some parts seemed almost ready to burst. Punctured by Dr. C., and about a pint of clear fluid drawn off, of the spec, gravity of 1.006, containing a small quantity of albumen, and re- sembling that of hydrocephalus. The tumor was then tied at various points with strong ligatures; intense pain fol- lowed, and the child died on the fourth day. See next specimen. 1864. Dr. H. G. Clcirk. 860. Tumor from the above case. Cavity formed by a dilata- • tion of the membranes. Spinal marrow removed, by cut- ting away the nerves ; of full size, and gradually lost upon inside of sac, about two inches from orifice. Some appear- ance of nerves in cavity of sac. Quantity of fat between sac and skin considerable. 1864. Dr. II. G. Clark. For a seventh case see No. 864. In the Transactions of the Patholog. Soc. of London, Yol. viii. p. 16, a case is related of extirpation of one of these tumors from over the sacrum ; the membranes of the spinal marrow being exposed, though not wounded. The patient was an infant, ten months old. The tumor was supposed to have arisen from the spinal canal, but I have103 healthy anatomy. seen nothing of the kind in the few cases that I have had ail opportunity to dissect. 861. A sixth case, that differs somewhat from the above in being situated over the junction of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae; covered with skin, and fluctuating. The patient was a very healthy infant,“three or four wee cs old. A double ligature was passed throuo-h the tu- mor by Dr. B., and tied; and it died on the ninth day. The membranes were inflamed at the seat of the tumor and the spinal marrow was continued down to it, as usual! The preparation of a part of the spine shows a separation of the laminae of the last lumbar vertebra, and the same was observed of the sacral; but these last were in part cut away in the removal of the specimen. 1856.

Extroversion of the bladder, etc.; in spirit. From a pa- • tient of Dr. Charles D. Cleveland. Child small, and lived a week. Labia separated to a considerable extent, and the pubic bones widely separated. Upon the surface of the bladderHEALTHY ANATOMY. 109 there open separately the small intestine, which is larger than natural, but only 3 ft. long, the large intestine which is only in. long, and three lines in diameter, and a well- developed and independent appendix cseci; the two last openings being traversed by bands. There is also a small and irregular offset from the large int. near its outlet. The uterus is in two widely separated portions ; the right about as large as the whole organ should be, with its tube, ovary, os tincm, and vagina ending in a cul-de-sac; the left was smaller and without a vagina, but otherwise the same. There is also the form of spina bifida above de- scribed (No. 853) ; the tumor over the sacrum being two or three inches in diameter, covered by integument and a very thin layer of fat, and discharging, when opened, a clear serum. 1860. Dr. C. Ellis. 865. A foetus, preserved entire. The liver, with a large portion of the small and large intestine, protrude at the umbilicus, and were in the recent state, as now, entirely uncovered. The placenta adhered to the top of the head ; and the cra- nial cavity, which was large, was mostly filled by serum, though there was also an undeveloped brain. The vault of the cranium was entirely wanting; the base being well developed. The left thumb is a mass of flesh, attached by a thread-like process, and this is the only other unusual external appearance. Labor occurred at the fifth month, and the breech presented. 1866. Dr. J.

The upper jaw, from its prominence, suggests the idea of the beak ol a bird ; the lower jaw retreating, and being ex- ceedingly movable. The tragus alone represents the external ear.HEALTHY ANATCXHY. 110 Trunk well formed, but tbe extremities (No. 868) were very deficient. The scapulas are narrow, and imperfectly developed. Each humerus is 2J in. in length, and con- nected by areolar tissue with the hands ; the forearms be- ing wanting. The right hand had three fingers; two fused, and one consisted only of a terminal phalanx. Upon the left was a thumb, a terminal phalanx connected with it, and one finger. The thigh bones are 3 in. long. The legs were strongly flexed upon the thighs, and quite short. Right tibia £ in. long, and, as well as the fibula, very broad, irregularly developed, and apparently quite cartilaginous. The foot had a truncated appearance, with- out toes, but with a well-formed heel; the skeleton con- sisting of a single, irregularly formed cartilage, and one small, second piece. Left tibia, If in. long, and well ossified, but quite broad and misshapen; lower third of fibula only formed, and consisted of a broad and thick cartilage. The foot was If in. long, with valgus, and a great toe, but no other. The tarsus consisted of a single cartilage, a well-developed toe, and by the side of it a sec- ond metatarsal bone, but nothing more. The internal or- gans were well-formed, excepting the heart. (No. 379.) Museum Fund. 867. Cranium from the above. A bone over each auditory meatus may be the malar, misplaced, atrophied, and fused with the temporals ; but, if not, there are no malars. In- termaxillaries very prominent. A trace only of the max- illaries exists, though the nasal processes are quite devel- oped. Orbital cavities quite open inferiorly, and the vo- mer very conspicuous. Palatine bones seem wanting. Large wings of sphenoid bone, and the temporals irregu- larly developed and fused; and of the zygoma there is hardly a trace. Two large cartilages, in the recent state, in the place of the nasal bones, and resembling them in form, though very much larger. Each half of the lower jaw is formed in two pieces ; the division being toward the front, and the malformation a very unusual one. 1859. Dr. N. C. Parker, of Farmington, A.

The second toe of each foot had become inflamed, and one of them was removed by Dr. C. All of the toes, also, are iuclined to the inner side of the feet. 1866. Dr. A. Cooliclge. 874-5. Casts, in plaster, by Dr. L., of the hands of a laborer, who was capable of doing as much work as any man. In the right hand one very broad metacarpal bone seemed to be common to the index and ring fingers, between which was a slnall nipple-like projection in place of a middle finger, and an open space toward which the fingers inclined. In the left there is the same open space, with two very imperfectly developed fingers, that were fused nearly to their extremities, and stiff, but having considerable motion upon a common metacarpal bone ; one of them has a nail. The other fingers, have, each, their own metacarpal bone. Both hands are very broad across the knuckles ; but, other- wise, they are well formed. 1849. Dr. E. Leigh. 876.

Malformation of the pelvis, and left lower extremity, in a five months and healthy-looking foetus; a ligamentary preparation by Dr. Hodges, and in spirit. The pelvis is compressed laterally, and distorted ; the sa- cium is open posteriorly, as in spina bifida, and the coccjtx turns backward. Upon the left side the body of the pubes is wanting, so that there is a deep notch from above instead of the thyroid foramen. The left acetabulum was situated very near to the spinous process of the ilium, and was so shallow that it could hardly be said to exist; the right was also very shallow, and allowed a very ready dislocation and reduction of the hip. The position of the right lower extremity was unnatural; but, as seen in the preparation, the skeleton is normal. The left femur is considerably shorter than the right. The fibula is one-fourth shorter than its fellow, broad and stout, and so curved that the sole of the foot, before dissection, lay close to the lower and inner part of the thigh. The tibia is represented by . its lower cartilaginous epiphysis only ; and this was con- nected, b}r a short fibrous band, with the inner condjde of the femur. Foot well formed. Patella wanting o The right hand was flexed to an acute angle upon the forearm; and the left forearm to a right angle upon the arm. Kidneys wanting. Renal capsules rather largely developed, and in their normal position. Bladder exceed- ingly small, and the rectum opened freely into it; there being no anus. 1867. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 878. The bones of the pelvis and lower extremity of a mon- strosity (Siren) ; in spirit, with some of the organs. The case was published in the Med. Jour. (Feb. 18th, 1869) ; and the following is a short abstract of the report. The lower extremities tapered as usual to a point; and the foetus, which was generally well formed, weighed about 3113 HEALTHY ANATOMY. lbs. On dissection, the diaphragm was wanting upon the left side, and the stomach and spleen lay in the chest. The right lung was well, but the left consisted of but a single lobe. A left upper vena cava opened into the left auricle; and in the heart was an interventricular opening. The aorta sent off two very small iliacs, and a large vessel that ran straight along the median line to the umbilicus. The rectum ended in a cul-de-sac (No. 682), and the left lobe of the liver and spleen consisted, each, of several . small lobes. Two renal capsules, and one small, encysted kidney. Uterus in two portions, and a cavity in each; with a Fall, tube, and ovary for each, and perhaps a rudi- mentary vagina. Bladder wanting. A little cutaneous excrescence was attached to the lower part of the spine, but had no connection with the spinal membranes. The ischia were fused throughout, as shown in the preparation, but leaving a pelvic cavity of considerable size ; pubic bones much depressed and elongated, and the obturator foramina very closely approximated; sacrum very irregularly de- veloped. The femur was 3J in. in length, and formed by a fusion of two; convex in front, and flat behind, with two distinct heads, two inner condyles and no intervening one, and two patellae upon the back of the knee-joint. In most respects the preparation resembles one of Cruveilhier’s (Anal. Path. liv. 40, pi. 6, fig. 6). Tibia 1^ in. in length, tapered suddenly to a point, and terminated in three little phalangeal cartilages. The muscles about the thigh were well-developed, and most of them wei’e distinctly made out, but some were wanting The case occurred in the practice of Dr. PI., and the child, though so small, was carried to the full period; and during the fifteen or twenty minutes that it gasped after its biith, the heart was felt beating strongly in the right side of the chest. Quantity of liquor amnii exceedingly small. Cord short, and the placenta very small; and both had a diseased look. The heart, aorta, and umbilical artery, spleen and lungs, are shown upon a bent glass rod, and iu the same jar with the pelvis, etc. The other organs are also preserved ; and for a cast of the liver see No. 689.

Two foetuses, united from the umbilicus to the upper third • of the sternum ; in spirit. The mother was forty-three years of age, and had had seven or eight well-formed children. In the present case the heads presented, and the children lived about fifteen minutes after they were born. A month afterward the mother was doing sufficiently well. Weight of the foetuses 5-LO- lbs. Each (A and B) had its oesophagus and stomach equally developed. At about an inch from the pylorus the duodena united, and the canal was single for 37 in. It then again divided, but first dilated into a cavity of a some- what triangular form, and nearly as large as the top of the thumb. Below this the small intestine of A was 23£ in., and of B, 32 in.; large intestine of A, 16^- in., and of B, 23 in. The intestine of A, 2% in. below the division, was obliterated by a thin septum ; and below this was smaller than the other, and contained only mucus. Dilatations just at the division of the intestine in double monsters, are de- scribed and figured in the Catalogue of the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet. As usual in such cases, the diaphragm formed one large arch. The livers were fused, and had two dis- tinct gall-bladders; and the following organs were found in each foetus, — the spleen, kidneys, and l’enal capsules, bladder, testicles, vesiculse seminales, lungs, etc. The two hearts were fused, and very broad for their length. The auricles formed almost a common cavity. The upper vena cava of A ran down upon the left side, but opened into the right auricle ; the course of the other v. cava being as usual. The pulmonary veins of each foetus, respectively, formed a common trunk; that of B opening into the right auricle. From the right ventricle of A a pulmonary artery arose, but there was no ductus arteri- osus. The left ventricle communicated pretty freety with the right, but not directly with the auricle. The aorta could be inflated, but a small probe could not be passed into it. Right umbilical artery wanting, and the iliac was, of course, very small; the left being very large. In B it was just the reverse. In B the pulmonary artery was normal. The left ventricle had no communication with the right, but was directly continuous with the right ventricle of A.HEALTHY ANATOMY. 116 Aorta normal excepting the left carotid, which arose from the innominata at its origin. The upper third of the sternum of each foetus was dis- tinct ; but, below this, each sternum was formed by a fu- sion of the right half from one foetus, and the left half from the other. 1859. Dr. D. J. Perlerj, of Oldtown, Me. 886. A second specimen, similar to the above, and preserved • in spirit. The feet presented ; labor was not very difficult, and the woman did perfectly well. Weight of the foetuses, 7| lbs. Sex, male. The muscles about the thorax vary somewhat, as the union of the foetuses is not exactly face to face ; and about the cord they are deficient to the extent of 1J in. Alimentary canal double to the duodena, where they unite, at the distances from the pylorus, respectively, of J in. and nearly 1 in. The intestine is then single for 44 in. ; aucl then divides again into 17£ in. of small, and 16 in. of large intestine for one foetus, and 18 of small, and 18£ of laro-e for the other. Livers fused. Two gall-bladders; one hepatic duct opening into the cystic near the intestine, and the other having apparently a separate opening, though very near to the cystic. The other organs of the abdomen are in two sets, and well formed, excepting the pancreas, in which last the two organs are united by the head. Dia- phragm as in the last case. The pleural cavities of one foetus communicated ; but, otherwise, the two sets of lungs, etc., were normal. Sternum as in the last case. The two hearts were intimately fused. The auricular portion consisted mainty of a fusion of the two right ami- des, and received the upper and two lower venae cavae. At each extremity of this common cavity was a left auricle, receiving the pulmonary veins respectively b}r a common trunk, and opening into the. ventricles; the lert auricle of A being quite small, and communicating largely with the general cavity, whilst that of B was more devel- oped, and so far separated as to show a foramen. The ventricular portion showed at the apex, externally, a tendency to fissure, and the two cavities communicated117 HEALTHY ANATOMY. freely toward the base. That of A was formed mainly by the ventricle that sent off the aorta; and the cavity from which the pulmonary artery arose was quite small, and communicated freely with it. That of B was much more equally divided into a right and left ventricle, which also communicated freely. Each ventricular portion had its separate aorta and pulmonary artery; and A had a long and slender ductus arteriosus, but B had none. 1847. Dr. B. E. Cotting. 886. f.

Organs examined by Dr. C., and mostly removed ; and the specimen was then dried ; its height about 16 in. The children were still-born, and the mother did quite well. Dr. C. was informed bjr the physician who attended the woman, and who had had a very extensive obstetrical practice, that, after one head was born, an evolution took place, and the breech came down, followed by the second head. Dr. C. found two stomachs, with a union of the intes- tines about six inches below ; a fusion of two livers ; two gall-bladders ; and one heart, which, with the blood-vessels has been partially injected, and is shown in situ, as well as the stomachs. 1850.

From this a double raphe, in the shape of a Y, extended backwards, each branch directed towards the coccyx of the same side. “ On the hinder face a third symmetrical arm was at- tached on a level with the normal ones. The hand was in the same plane with the other segments of the limb, namely,119 IIEALTIIY ANATOMY. from before backwards, the thumb pointing between the heads ; it had no palm, but two backs, and each finger had nails on the two sides. The thumb and index finger were connate. The spinal grooves converged downwards, be- tween which a third leg, symmetrical in structure, but somewhat distorted bjr pressure, arose on a level with the two normal legs, and was bent upwards, so that the toes pointed towards the back. The foot was compound, and provided with two groups of toes, of three each, one right and the other left, and a single large symmetrical toe arose from the middle of the back of the foot. This toe had a nail on each side. If this third leg is brought down to a level with the others, the heel is directed to the space be- tween the other two feet, and thus the legs together form a true tripod. “ Skeleton. — A general conception of the plan of the skeleton maybe formed by supposing two skeletons placed side by side, the arms nearest each other pointing back- wards and palm to palm, and the corresponding legs with the toes turned backwards, and then each skeleton cut in a plane extending from the median line in front outwards to the right in one, and to the left in the other, through the clavicle, glenoid cavity, lengthwise of the arm and hand, so as to separate the inner and palmar surfaces from the dorsal; also in the same direction through the ribs and acetabulum, lengthwise of the legs,, and through the second toe; this done, the portions of the skeletons nearest each other are to be thrown away, and the remaining ones brought together and fused. This, except with reference to a very few unimportant differences of detail, would give us a correct idea of the state of things in the skeleton here described. “ It will be unnecessary to describe any other parts than those connected with the third limbs, it being borne in mind that, seen in front, the two crania and vertebral col- umns, the thorax, pelvis, and limbs are formed as usual, except that the parts on the right side of the median line are connected with one head and vertebral column, and that on the left with the other. On the hinder side of the double thorax there is no sternum, except a small portionHEALTHY ANATOMY. 120 described below; the ribs are short, bent strongly down- wards, reaching nearly to the pelvis, and arc united by their cartilages. “ The arm is connected with the rest of the skeleton by means of a piece of cartilage, which is attached to the top of the sternum above described, and resembles a manubri- um, but has no connection with the ribs; it is directed backwards between the two necks, and supports a symmet- rical clavicle, which has the same direction. This has a deep fissure at either end, prolonged into a groove on theHEALTIIY ANATOMY. 121 bod}' of the bone. It is formed, as it were, of two clavi- cles so turned that their upper surfaces are pressed against each other, and their greater concavities directed upwards. The scapula is composed of two bones, united at the gle- noid cavity, having an acromion and spine on each side, but no coracoid processes. The bones of the arm, forearm, and hand are perfectly symmetrical; all the bones of the last two are arranged in a plane passing through the foetus from before backwards, the radius in front and the ulna just be- hind it. “ The pelvis, as seen behind, has neither pubic nor ischi- atic bones, but consists of two ilia, the left one of A and the right of B, united at the acetabulum, which last is on the median line. The femur is much compressed laterally, is slightly twisted, but otherwise symmetrical. The tibia and fibula are in the same plane with the arms, and each has a projecting point of bone, as if they had both been fractured. The tibia is the foremost of the two, and has a right and left tuberosity for the attachment of the right and left patella. The tarsal bones were not ossified, but the cartilage of a single os calcis was easily made out. The large and symmetrical toe had three phalanges, show- ing that it did not correspond with the great toe, contrary to what its great size would lead one to expect. “ Muscles.— Only such parts of the muscular system will require notice as are connected with the limbs described above, all the others being normal. “The left sterno-inastoid of A and the right of B have the usual attachments to the head, but both are inserted into one and the same symmetrical clavicle and the single sternal piece above mentioned. “ The left sterno-hyoid and sierno-thyroid of A and the right ones of B arise from a common sternum, but are in- serted into the usual parts belonging to the corresponding heads of the foetus. “ The two trapezii, one arising from each head and ver- tebral column, are inserted into their respective portions of the compound scapula and clavicle. “ The levator anguli scapulae and the rhomboidei are double.122 HEALTIIY ANATOMY. “ Neither pectoralis major nor minor were found. “ A serratus magnus, on each side, arises from the ribs, and is inserted as usual into the base of the scapula on the same side with itself. “ A right and left latissimus dorsi, supra and infraspi- natus, teres major and minor, are all inserted into their re- spective portions of the humerus on each side. The deltoid arises equally from the two portions of scapula and the end of the compound clavicle ; it is inserted sjunmetrically into the humerus. A subscapularis arises from each base of the scapula, but the two are inserted into each other by the union of the tendons, just behind the glenoid cavity. “ The triceps has two long heads, one arising from the edge of each half of the scapula, and twro short heads aris- ing from the side of the humerus, and is inserted as usual into the olecranon. “ In the place of the biceps and brachialis is a single muscle, arising from the humerus by a pointed head on each side of the deltoid, and in this respect resembling the brachialis; but, like the biceps, its tendon is inserted into the radius. There was no long head. Its action would be that of the biceps. “ The following muscles were repeated symmetrically on the two sides of this third arm : — “ Supinator longus and S. brevis. “ Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. “ Extensor carpi ulnaris. “ Extensor carpi digitorum communis. “ Extensor longus pollicis. “ Abductor longus. “ There were no flexors or pronators, nor any extensor proprius of the index or little fingers. “ Below the ribs and their cartilages on this side of the foetus, some ill-defined muscles occupied the place of the broad muscles of the abdomen, but could not be identified as such. “ A psoas and iliacus interims existed on each side, but both were inserted into the single trochanter minor on the front of the femur. “ A glutceus maximus arose from each side of the com-HEALTHY ANATOMY. 123 pound ilium, but both were inserted together into the back of the femur. “ A single median gracilis arose from the symphysis of the ilia, and was inserted into the tibia in front between the two tuberosities. “ The extensor muscles of the leg, namely, the rectus and vasti, were found in double series ; the recti arising as usual from the pelvic, and the vasti from the lateral por- tions of the femur ; each series was inserted into a corre- sponding patella, and by means of their respective liga- ments into the right and left tuberosities of the tibia. Thus each set of extensors became a flexor with reference to the other. A biceps on each side was inserted into the top of the fibula. Besides this last-mentioned muscle, there were no other proper flexors of the leg. “ On each side of the tibia was a tibialis anticus, but both were inserted into the top of the foot by a common tendon. “ An extensor communis on each side of the tibia was inserted into the three corresponding toes, and a slip was given from each to the symmetrical toe. “ A peroneus brevis was inserted to the outer sides of the foot. “ A single gastrocnemius was present, but no soleus. “ A flexor communis longus on each side was inserted into the toes in the same order as the extensors. “ Nerves of the Arm.—A brachial plexus, consisting of five pairs of nerves, is given off from each neck, namely, from the left side of A and the right of B, and, with the exception of the internal cutaneous nerves, the branches of the two sides keep separate. In the axilla each plexus gives off a circumflex and an external cutaneous nerve, the latter perforating the supinator longus at the lower part of the arm. The two external cutaneous nerves unite and de- scend the back of the arm on the median line. The re- maining branches of the brachial plexus pass on each side between the long head of the triceps and the humerus, de- scend on the sides of the arm, form the musculo-spiral, ray- dial, and ulnar nerves, which last two are distributed to the backs of the hand. No median nerve was found.HEALTHY ANATOMY. 124 “Nerves of the leg. — The sciatic nerve on each side as it passes from beneath the glutaeus consists of three por- tions, two lateral and one median ; each of the former, one to the right and the other to the left, passes along the edges of the external vasti and within the lower ends of the bi- cipites, then over the top of the fibula, forming the peroneal nerve, and finally to the back of the foot. The two inner branches, one from each side, unite on the median line, near the trochanter, into one, which descends as far as the pop- liteal space, where it divides into two branches, which de- scend behind the tibia, one on each side of the fibula and os calcis; the one going to the side of the foot belonging to B is the longest. The two form a right and left plantar nerve. “ The phrenic nerves on the front side were distributed separately to the diaphragm, descending on each side of the pericardium. The posterior pair united on the hinder face of the pericardium, but their distribution was not traced. “ The four vagus nerves, two from each head, were kept distinct throughout. The peculiar distribution of the recur- rent branches will be mentioned further on. “ Viscera. — A rather small thymus gland occupied the upper part of the cavity of each half of the thorax, and rose a short distance in the usual place at the base of each neck. Two complete sets of lungs existed, and between them a single pericardium enclosing two distinct hearts. These were entirely distinct from each other, but symmet- rically developed, or right and left. A single lower vena cava entered the pericardium from below, and then entered each venous auricle by separate branches; the same was true of the upper vena cava. The venous auricles of the heart were on adjoining sides, and the arterial auricles on the sides most distant from each other. The aorta of the heart of A descended on the right side of the vertebral column of A, and that of B on the left side of its vertebral column; in this case the right aorta, or that of A, was the one transposed, while that of B pursued the ordinary course. The innominate artery of A arose from the left side, and that of B from the right side of the arch. The recurrent branches of the vagus were in conformity with125 HEALTHY ANATOMY. this arrangement. The left recurrent of A and the right of B passed beneath the subclavian, while the right of A and the left of B passed beneath the arch of the aorta. “ A large opening was found in the diaphragm on the right side, and through this the right portion of the liver and some portions of the intestinal canal had passed. “The umbilical cord had one vein and two arteries as usual, the former entering the liver on the median line of the body. “ The liver was not quite symmetrical in its shape, hav- ing been distorted apparently by the forced position of a part of it in the cavit}’- of the thorax. It consists of three portions, a right and left lobe, each of which corresponds with the right lobe of a normal liver, but one of them is reversed. These unite on the middle line and form a third lobe, which corresponds with the left lobe of the two nor- mal livers fused. Each lateral lobe has a bile duct, gall- bladder and common duct; also a portal vein, symmetri- cally arranged. A vena cava inferior passes up on each side in the notch formed by the union of the median and lateral lobes, but the two unite before entering the pericar- dium. “ There were two stomachs, with their pyloric portions turned towards each other; the great cul-de-sac of that belonging to A was in the right liypochondrium, and there- fore reversed, while that of B had the usual position and was in the left. A spleen was connected with each. The right and left duodenums came together a short distance from the pylorus and formed a lateral communication, but afterwards separated, and though side by side continued distinct nearly to the ccecum, which, as well as the large intestine, was single. The length of the small intestine was 32 in. “ The urinary organs consisted of two compound kid- neys and an urinary bladder with a double cavity. Each kidney had its hilus turned from the median line, was strongly bent on itself, and had a renal capsule at each end, so that there were in all four renal capsules. Each kidney also had two ureters, one of them much larger than the other, one set opening into the upper and the other into theHEALTHY ANATOMY. 126 lower cavity of the bladder. This, excepting a constriction near its fundus, had the usual shape; but inwardly the mucous membrane formed a partial partition between the upper and lower portions. The two sets of ureters opened, one just above and the other just below this partition. “ There were two pairs of testes, — one resting on the kidneys or quite near them, and the other just at the en- trance of the internal abdominal ring on the front of the foetus. Each testis had an epididymis and vas deferens, but in neither case was it traced to its connection with the bladder. There were, however, to be seen just below the septum of the bladder, mentioned above, three openings, which probably belonged to the vasa deferentia, one pair entering the bladder separately, while the other united and entered through a single opening. “ The descriptions of double monsters by many different observers all show that the tendency is to symmetrical de- velopment, so that when an organ ordinarily single becomes double the two organs are always right and left. This is well seen in the specimen just described, in the existence of a right and left heart, right and left stomach, spleen, etc. In the cases where organs, commonly double, are increased in number, we may have either a third organ, or two entire ones. In the first case the law of sj’mmetry is manifest in a most striking manner. For all .such third organs, if not compound in structure, are divisible into right and left halves, and half from a different foetus, and repeating each other oppositely. If, however, they are made up of many parts, as a limb, then the individual parts repeat each other in a similar way. In the arm al- ready described, the muscles repeat and balance each other exactly throughout, and the same is mostly true of the legs. “ The force, whatever it be, which regulates the distri- bution of matter in a normal or abnormal embryo, always acts symmetrically, and if we look for anything among known forces, analogous to it, it is to be found, if an}r- where, in those known as polar forces. The essential fea- tures of polarity, as in symmetry, are antagonism, eitherHEALTHY ANATOMY. 127 of qualities or forms. Studying the subject in the most general manner, there are striking resemblances between the distribution of matter capable of assuming a polar condition, and free to move around a magnet, and the dis- tribution of matter around the nervous axis of an em- bryo. “In every complete series of magnetic curves there are two neutral lines, one extending lengthwise of the magnet, so that the curves formed are divided into right and left; secondly, a transverse one, the particles on each side of which are known as forming the north and south curves. In the right and left series, those which are on one side of the magnet are symmetrical with those on the other, but not in themselves ; and in the north and south series those on either side of the transverse neutral line are sym- metrical with each other, but not in themselves. Thus we have in the first case something analogous to right and left or bilateral symmetry, and in the second to fore and hind symmetry. “If two magnets are placed parallel to each other and at a distance, then two complete sets of curves are formed in the usual way ; but if they are brought so as to be within each other’s influence, the magnetic figure now becomes a compound one, the central portion of which consists of the united curves from the two adjoining sides of the magnet, and the particles from either series of the curves do not pass beyond the line where the forces of the two magnets are in equilibrium. “ If the magnets are now inclined towards each other so as to touch at one end, having a V-shape, then we shall have the particles arranged so as to produce a figure double in front but single behind. The ends which are separated will arrange the particles so as to form a double series of curves, independent of each other; but as the magnets come nearer together, the curves begin to press against each other, and an intermediate symmetrical figure is formed. “ The distribution of matter in animals having bilateral symmetry, both in normal and abnormal development, is analogous to the series of distributions just described.HEALTHY ANATOMY. 128 In normal development such distribution comprises, first, all that we designate as right and left; second, all that we designate fore and hind, with reference to the ends of the long axis of the bod}", or to what lias been called foi’e and hind symmetry. In the fully developed animal this last is less easily recognized than the first, but in the embryo it can be traced without much difficulty. “ 1st, in the nervous canal, enlarged at either end, the foremost enlargement for the brain, permanent; the hind- most, transitoiy, except in birds, where it forms the en- largement enclosing the rhomboidal sinus. “ 2d, the plates of the vertebral column first appear mid- way, and are then developed in opposite directions, extend- ing it backwards and forwards. “ 3d, in the intestinal canal, with its allantoidian sac, which is respiratory, antagonizing the pulmonary sac, also respiratory. “ 4th, in the limbs, which throughout all their earlier stages assume positions strictly antagonistic. “ If on one and the same yolk two nervous axes are formed on opposite sides of the }"olk, each will distribute the matter under its influence without coming in collision with that of the other, except near the umbilicus, so that two nearly perfect embryos will be formed. “ If the two nervous axes are formed near to each other, so that the particles under their influence come in contact, then at the line of contact a series of intermediate organs or limbs, as the case may be, under the influence of the two axes, will be formed, as in the specimen described in this paper. “ Furthermore, if the axes are inclined so as to form a Y-shaped figure, the two separated ends will have a head more or less complete ; but as the two converge, the organs become more or less fused, and at length the hindmost are reduced to the normal type, the intermediate ones having become obsolete.” 893.

The notes that were taken of the dissection having been lost, it can only be stated that between the scapulce there was an attempt to form another, as was shown by a small cartilage.

The aorta gives off not far above its origin a large and common trunk, that soon di- vides into the two carotids, and a common trunk for the two subclavians of A. About an inch beyond, it sends off another large branch, about three inches in length, and that divides into the two carotids for B. It then receives the ductus arteriosus, and, two inches beyond, it gives off a branch larger than the last, and more than three inches in length; sending off, then, the left subclavian of B, and soon afterwards two branches to the lung of B. These last must be considered as branches of the pulmonary artery, as this vessel is seen to give off branches that went to the lung of A, but none in the opposite direction. One of the pulmonary veins is seen, and the lower cava ; but as to the upper cava there is a question ; there must have been two, and one of them may have had an unusual termination. All of the above vessels were dissected in situ, and marked where there could have been any question about them. Museum Fund.131 HEALTHY ANATOMY. 900. A foetal cluck, entire; in spirit.

Dr. C. observed in more than one case that the action of the hearts in the double fishes was not synchronous. A large number of these double trout have been the progeny of a very prolific individual that is kept in a tank b}r itself, and has to be fed, as it is perfectly blind, and apparently from cataracts.

The following description of this well-known individual is a summary of one that was published, with a figure, in the third volume of the Philadelphia Jour, of the Med. &HEALTIIY ANATOMY. 132 Physical Sciences (1821), by Prof. John K. Mitchell, of Philadelphia, who, when a young man, happened to see Ake, and sent to the Journal, from Canton, a very full report of what he had observed. The description that is recorded in the Catalogue of the Hunterian Museum, and referred to more or less fully by Geoff. St. Hilaire, and others, was by Mr. Livingstone, Surgeon of the British Factory at Canton; but Mr. L. himself never saw Ake, and the artist who was employed to make the model that was sent to England, only made it after he had seen the individual, and, as he said, had carefully examined him. Mr. L.’s description was sent by Prof. M. to the above Journal not long before he sent his own, and was published in the second volume, p. 148. Ake was sixteen years old, 4 ft. 7 in. in height (Mr. Livingstone sa}rs 4 ft. 10 in.), and rather delicate in appear- ance, though he reported himself healthy. His mother had a tedious labor at the time of his birth, but did well. (Mr. L. saj's that she survived only two days.) His uncle, who, with him, stated that he was a vigorous infant, and that the parasite, as it has been called (and that may be desig- nated as P.), was nearly as large as himself at birth. It consisted of a neck, trunk, and four extremities ; the attach- ment on the part of P. extending to within 2 inches of the pubes, and on the part of A, from about 1J in. below the top of the sternum, to about 1 in. above the navel. Length of P. from neck to heel, 31 in.; neck, 2 in.; from base of scapula to top of sacrum, in.; bod}^ and neck, 12 in.; lower limbs, 19 in.; left foot, 5 in. ; upper extrem- ities, with hands, 18.J in.; penis, when flaccid, 3 in; cir- cumference of penis, 2£ in.; pelvis, 18 in.; body above pelvis, 10 in.; upper part of thigh, 11 in.; of arm, 7 in.; elbow, 6 in.; and middle of fore-arm, 3 in. Perpendicular height of adherent surface, 7£ in., and circumference of same, 17£ in. (In a foot-note to Mr. L.’s description in the Hunterian Catalogue, it is stated that Lieut.-Gen. Wood, on careful measurement, found the trunk and neck to be about 11 in., and the longest limb, 13 in.) Its gen- eral appearance was meagre, and the hands and feet were cold in the warmest weather (the usual temperature of133 HEALTHY ANATOMY. both being natural, according to Mr. L.) The limbs, though round and plump at first, became much attenuated toward their extremities. Union face to face ; but A could readily turn P. so as to bring its nates (Mr. L. says either side) into contact with his abdomen. These opposing sur- faces were excoriated, and required the constant interven- tion of a roll of cloth to prevent ulceration. There was but one scapula (Mr. L. says two), and that extended across the back to the left shoulder. The spines of three vertebrae were discoverable in the neck, and they were then lost beneath the scapula. Between this last and the pelvis, the back, which was quite soft, sank deeply in, and no ver- tebrae could be felt. There were the usual number of fingers, but they were very feebly developed. Right foot clubbed (according to Mr. L. they both were), and the left had but three toes. Scapula and humeri so loosely con- nected with the neighboring parts that they could be moved from the pelvis nearly to the top of its neck. All the joints of the upper extremities admitted of a limited mo- tion (Mr. L. says free). The lower extremities, however, were stiff, and the hips probably anchylosed. A. and his uncle said that when he was four or five years old he could move these ; and he could also move the upper extremities. His mother, however, passed a string about them, and over the neck, to protect them from injury ; and, the heels being- brought nearly into contact with the nates, excoriation en- sued, followed by adhesion of the calf of the leg to the back of the thigh, and loss of motion at the knee-joints. About two years before Prof. M. saw him, P.’s left humerus was broken, by a fall from a buffalo, but it had united firmly. The penis, 3 in. in length, as above stated, enlarged dur- ing erection, and the scrotum “ might have contained the testes of a vigorous adult.” No testes, however, were found in it; though there seemed to be one at the left ab- dominal ring, as shown by a tumor there, and the peculiar pain that was caused b}*- pressure upon it. (Mr. L. says that there was no vestige of the testes, and very little scro- tum.) There was a congenital phymosis, but the glans was in a natural condition, and a mucous secretion was134 HEALTHY ANATOMY. emitted guttatim. There was never, however, as the lad said, a discharge of semen or of urine. (Mr. L. says, however, that the kidneys of P. seem to perform their func- tion perfectly; and states that Gen. Wood examined the pair with great attention at his own house, and saw them urinate simultaneously. This last very important state- ment is recorded in a foot-note to Mr. L.’s description, as published in the Philadelphia Journal above referred to ; but in the note to the description in the Hunterian Cata- logue, and in which Lieut.-Gen. Wood’s measurements of Ake are given, nothing is said of the urine.) Erection of the penis took place when excited by imagination or irrita- tion ; but, when from this last, the penis of A did not be- come erect. The pelvis was large and well formed, the nates plump and prominent, and in the place of the anus there was a deep dimple. The nipples of P. were not more than If in. from the “ anter. super, spine of the ileum ; ” and those of A wrere on a line with the shoulders of P. This last had no vestige of a navel; in the case of A. there was an ap- pearance of its having been double, but that was owing, it was said, to the excoriation above referred to. The abdomen and thorax of P. seemed to form one large muscular sac, two-thirds of which were united on the sides to ridges, probably of bone, that arose from the front of A. “ Within the area bounded by this ridge, there appears to be a vacuity in the bony structure of the chest of Ake, and it seems probable that if the two chests do not form one cavity, they are only separated from each other by soft parts ; ” and “ when the lad coughs or breathes the sac of the parasite is puffed up like a bladder.” There was no sig» of a heart in P., and pulsation was only obscurely felt in one place; that was in the femoral artery, and it wras synchronous with the radial pulse of A.; 90 in the morning, and increasing gradually to 115 towards night. (Mr. L. says that pulsation had been dis- tinctly felt in the carotids ; but Prof. M. made a most care- ful search, and could find nothing of it.) Prof. M. says that the bod}', and especially the neck of P. is acutely sensible, but he strongly denies, on the au-HEALTHY ANATOMY. 135 thority of A., the statement of his keepers, that when any part of P.’s body is pinched, the corresponding part of his own feels a sensation. This seems altogether improbable, and yet Mr. L. says that the experiment was tried, and “ the statement most satisfactorily confirmed by an ingenious medical gentleman.” 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 905.

The lower part of the trunk of the dependant seems also to have been considerably developed. The child itself is 22 in. long, and otherwise well formed externally. So far as it can be ascertained, it came from Canada, was exhibited in New York in 1858, and died of pneumonia at the age of 4^ months. It was bright and vigorous, and the adventitious limbs had the power of motion. It was said that there was an anus, and a penis, with excretions, but this statement was contra- dicted. Case never published, so far as known. 1861. Museum Fund. 906. Photograph of a child, seven months old, that had a large congenital tumor attached to the cheek, and in which were found the organs of a second child. i Prof. Joseph Pancoast, of Philadelphia, who removed the tumor, and sent the photograph to Dr. W., stated to him in a letter, dated Dec. 7th, 1859, as follows : — “ I find a rudimentary bony pelvis and limbs, a large stomach and large intestine, the latter having striped mus- cular fibres at its lower end, and terminating in a cul-de- sac. The stomach and intestinal canal communicated by three orifices with the external air ; and a tubular process of the buccinator muscle of the perfect child (which is now well and hearty) seems to have been employed to pump the air through these orifices into the hollow viscera. The absorbent glands were numerous and large. It had an independent growth of its own, and was growing, at the time I removed it, at a faster rate than the perfect child.”136 HEALTHY ANATOMY. This case has never been published, though Prof. P.’s clin- lque upon the subject was reported in the Philadelphia Med.& Surg. Reporter, March, 1859 ; and from this last the follow- ing extracts are made : Tumor nearly a foot in length, and divides upon the surface into several globular masses, with fingers and a rudimentary forearm. Intestines covered by skin, but at birth by a membrane like the peritoneum. Parasite separated from the child by a peculiar, caul-like membrane. Pulsation distinct, from 40 to 100 per minute, and not synchronous with that of the child’s heart. Re- moved by the ecraseur. Weight nearly 2J lbs. In struc- ture, it looked like a fatty tumor, with the parts of a foetus superadded. A body, regarded as a heart, contained im- perfectly formed auricles and ventricles. Mesenteric ar- teries and veins large. About 18 in. of intestine, and end- ing in a cul-de-sac. Meconium mixed with a large amount of adipose matter. There was also a liver, a large nerve running through the mass, appearances of a bladder and urachus, a penis or clitoris, and externally an umbilicus. I860* Dr. J. Mason Warren. 907-8.

The upper edge is broken off, and perhaps all around, and lies now rather in front of the bod}7, as in No. 140 in the Med. Soc.’s Museum ; thus allowing a backward displacement of the body. The thickness of this last is very much di- minished, but, as it would appear, rather by an absorption than by a crushing down of the cancelli; and the same change seems to be going on in the body of the vertebra below. Antero-posterior curvature moderate. A dry specimen. The other half of the same, in spirit; to show the spinal marrow and membranes, which, so far as appeared exter- nally, were quite uninjured. From a woman, get. twenty-five years, who fell 15 ft., and seventeen days afterwards entered the Hospital (114, 82). Lower extremities paralyzed, and sensibility diminished.

The patient was a sailor, twenty-four years of age, who fell 50 ft. on board of a vessel, and lived nearly seven weeks after the accident, under the care of Dr. G., at the Marine Hospital.MORBID ANATOMY. 142 There was throughout a complete loss of the power of motion, and of sensation, excepting some indistinct sense of feeling toward the last. Urine retained for the first day or two, but ever afterward discharged involuntarily, as were the freces. Urine also strongly ammoniacal, and mixed with pus. The man only complained of pain in his back when he was moved, and then not urgently. Bed-sores soon began to form, and became large and numerous be- fore death; and the emaciation was very extreme. Four dorsal and one lumbar vertebrae having been removed, and prepared in connection, by Mr. Charles S. Wood, a student of Dr. G., it is seen that the bod}- of the eleventh dorsal is very extensively fractured, and the curvature is such that the body of the tenth must be within one-third of an inch, or less, of the first lumbar. There is much new bone about the bodies of the three last dorsal vertebrae anteri- orly, but scarcely any posteriorly. Laminae of the elev- enth broken away from transverse processes. Spinous processes in line, but that of the tenth is broken and com- minuted. Eleventh rib broken upon each side, near the spine, but partially united. 1869. Dr. J. W. Graves, of Chelsea. 941. Several vertebrae, separated by maceration, and showing an extensive fracture of the first lumbar. From a girl, aet. 19, who jumped 20 ft. from a building, when on fire, and struck upon the nates. Immediate pa- ralysis of the lower extremities and sphincters followed, with insensibility. Three weeks afterward, when she entered the Hospital (39, 132), there was sensibility, with some power over the sphincters, but a very marked projection of the vertebrae. Also much pain in legs from the time of the accident. Lived about nine months, and died of phthisis. The whole upper edge of the first lumbar vertebra was broken off, and, from the curvature that ensued, it has come nearly into contact with the body of the second. The body is almost split through vertically, from back to front; the anterior face is forced backward by the body of the last dorsal that lies upon it, and the back part of the body en-143 MORBID ANATOMY. croaches very greatly upon the spinal canal. The body of the last dorsal is also broken about two-thirds through from behind forward ; but without any diminution of its thickness. The different parts of the first lumbar are con- solidated ; but there is nowhere any new growth nor ap- pearance of inflammation. Prepared by Dr. Hodges. 1857. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 942-3. Two casts, in plaster, of the back, from a case of frac- ture of the spine, with final recovery. The patient, a sailor, aet. eighteen years, fell 60 ft. from the mast-head of a vessel, and struck upon his back. The accident happened Sept. 19th, 1866, and he was carried to the Hospital at once (127, 146). Back bowed as though the bodies of the vertebrae were broken anteriorly. He was in great pain, but could move his legs, and had sensibility in them. On the 20th the record was : “ Both extremities natural as far as motion and sensation are con- cerned.” Bladder not very full, but the catheter was used. 21st: “ Motion and sensibility of legs still good.” Urine normal. 22d: Same record of extremities. 2 dej. after enema, and one involuntary in night. 23d : Urine drawn much oftener, and as cloudy. 24th: Frequent desire to micturate, but is unable to do so. Catheter ; and left in. 25th : “ No apparent loss of power or sensation in lower extremities.” Tender between last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae. Oct. 4th : “ Can move himself about in bed.” Scalding: pain in urethra during micturition. 8th: Sits up with help. Distinct curvature from 3 in. below scapulae to up- per edge of pelvis, but without any distinct local depres- sion or prominence. No marked local pain on pressure. Urine ammoniacal.

On the 26th he was discharged, well. The case thus far was published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lxxvi. p. o90), by Dr. Geo. H. Gay, who had charge of the patient until the 1st of Nov. From the Mass. Gen. Hospital he went directly to the Maiine Hospital at Chelsea, where he was under the care of Dr. Graves. On admission he walked with crutches, but on the 10th of January he could walk very well with- out even a cane, and he continued to improve until he left the hospital, on the 23d of March. 1867. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 944-5. Two casts of the back, from the above case, taken after the man had been for some time at the Marine Hospital, and showing a great diminution of the curvature of the spine. As in the case of the two first casts, one was taken whilst the patient was sitting up, and the other as he was lying down; the curvature being most marked in the first. 1867. Dr. John W. Graves. 946. The fifth lumbar vertebra, from a Flat-Head Indian, show- ing an entire separation of each lamina from the body of the bone between the two articulating processes, and also of the laminae from each other, upon the posterior median line. The first is regarded b}r Dr. J. Wyman as the result of an old and undescribed form of fracture; and in the Med. Jour. (Aug. 12th, 1869), he has reported eleven cases of the same, that he has seen; to which might be added that of Dr. John C. Warren, the founder of the Museum. Dr. W. says that this fracture is “ often noticed in the preparation of skeletons,” that it has only been observed in the fourth or fifth lumbar vertebra, and that in one sub- ject he found it in both of these bones. He thinks that it cannot be a malformation, and the result of an arrest of development, as the separation of the fragments is not where it should be in that case ; and yet there is an uni- formity in the appearance of the bones, and an absence ofMORBID ANATOMY. 145 anything like comminution, that at once suggests the idea of malformation. In the present case we must suppose, if the laminae were broken upon the sides, that they were broken also, and most symmetrically, upon the posterior median line. 1862. Museum Fund. 947.

Hospital, 97, 62. 1861. Dr. George H. Gay. 949. Cranium of a man who lived twelve and one-half years after the passage of a large iron bar through his head. The subject of this case was twenty-five years of age, of a strong constitution, and in vigorous health, and was engaged in blasting rocks, when the charge exploded. The bar, with which he was ramming or tamping it down, having been driven through his head, was thrown high into the air, fell at a distance of some rods, and was picked up smeared with blood and brain. The accident happened in the State of Vermont, Sept. 13th, 1848, and an account of the case was first published by Dr. Harlow, in the Boston Med. & Surg. Jour, in Dec. (Vol. xxxix. p. 389). In a few minutes he recovered his consciousness, was put into an ox-cart, and having been carried three-fourths of a 10MORBID ANATOMY. 146 mile to his hotel, he got out with some assistance, and en- tered the house. Two hours afterward, when he was seen by Dr. Harlow, he was quite conscious and collected in his mind, but exhausted by a profuse hemorrhage from the top of the head ; the scalp being everted, the bones very exten- sively fractured and upraised, and the brain protruding. In front of the angle of the lower jaw, upon the left side, was a linear wound through which the bar had entered, by the pointed end. There was a protrusion of the left eye, equal to nearly one-half of its diameter ; and the left side of the face was more prominent than the right. With a view to the presence, possibly, of any foreign bodies, Dr. II. passed one index finger down its whole length into the wouud from above, and the other freely upward from be- low. Frequent vomiting of blood from the stomach. The pulse at this time was 60. On the 15th the hemorrhage had ceased; vision of the left eye was indistinct, and there was delirium. On the 16th a fetid discharge, with particles of brain, from the head ; with a discharge also from the mouth. 23d : More rational, stronger, and asked for food. Vision in left eye quite gone. Pulse 60-84 since the accident. On the 24th erysipelas appeared below the wound ; and for the next three days he was more comatose, with a large fungous growth from the upper wound, and a fungus from the inner canthus of the eye, that first appeared on the 19th. 27th: Discharge from the upper wound small, and exhalations from the mouth horribly fetid. The large fungous growth was excised, and § viii of pus were discharged by incision over the lower part of the frontal bone. Eye very promi- nent. The discharge after this was profuse and fetid. Oct. 6th he was better locally and generally, and sat up for a few minutes, but appeared demented. Nov. 8th he was in every way doing well, and went abroad. On the 14th he walked half a mile, exposed to dampness and cold, and there followed a febrile attack, with lancinating pain in the left side of the head and face. For this he was bled and purged; and on the 18th he was about the house again. On the twenty-fifth, about seven weeks and a half after theMORBID ANATOMY. 147 accident, lie returned home, a distance of about thirty miles. January 1st, 1849, the wound was quite closed. In April the left malar bone continued to be more prominent than the right. The eye, however, was less prominent than it had been; but the motions of the globe were lim- ited, and there was ptosis of the lid, with a partial paralysis of the left side of the face. Upon the top of the head was a quadrangular prominence, and behind this a deep depres- sion. No pain, but a queer feeling in the head. In regard to the state of his mind, he was very fitful and vacillating, though still very obstinate, as he always had been; and he was very profane, though never so before the acci- dent. After his recovery he travelled about with his bar, and exhibited himself in several of the large cities in this country; and in 1851 he got a situation, as a hostler, in a stable. In August, 1852, he went to S. America, and drove a six-horse stage-coach in Chili. In 1859 and ’60 his health began to fail, and early in 1860 he had a long sick- ness, but no particulars could be learned in regard to it. In June, 1860, he went to San Francisco, where his friends were residing ; and as his health improved, he went to work upon a farm. In February, 1861, he had a fit, and soon two or three others. He had b*en ploughing on the day that he was attacked, and had had no premonitory symp- toms. In a few days he was better, and did at different times various kinds of work. On the 20th of May he was attacked with severe convulsions, which recurred frequent- ly ; and on the following day he died. In July, 1866, Dr. Harlow ascertained that his patient’s mother was residing at San Francisco; and after a cor- respondence with her, and other members of the family who were with her, he not merely obtained the final history of the case, but in the most commendable spirit, and with a full appreciation of the scientific interest of the case, per- mission was given to have the cranium removed, and sent here for examination and preservation. In effecting this very desirable object, he was aided by D. D. Shattuck,148 MORBID ANATOMY. Esq., a brother-in-law of his patient, Dr. Coon, Mayor of the city, and Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, all of San F. The cranium arrived in this citjq with the bar, in 1868, and have been most generously presented, by Dr. Harlow, to the Medical College. On examination of the cranium, it is generally, though not always, possible to distinguish between the bones that are gone, as the result of the injury, and those that have crumbled' away and been lost since the man’s death; the. smoothness of the edges determining this point for the most part. The whole of the small wing of the sphenoid bone upon the left side is gone, with a large portion of the large wing, and a large portion of the orbital process of the frontal bone; leaving an opening in the base of the skull, 2 in. in length, 1 in. in width, posteriorly, and taper- ing gradually and irregularly to a point anteriorly. This opening extends from the sphenoidal fissure to the situation of the frontal sinus; and its centre is an inch from the median line. The optic foramen, and the foramen rotun- dum are intact. Below the base of the skull the whole posterior portion of the upper maxillary bone is gone. The malar bone is uninjured ; but it has been very percep- tibly forced outward, and the external surface inclines somewhat outward, from above downward. The lower jaw is also uninjured. The opening in the base above de- scribed is continuous with a line of old and united fracture that extends through the supra-orbitary ridge, in the situa- tion of the foramen, inclines toward, and then from the median line, and terminates in an extensive fracture that was caused by the bar as it came out through the top of the head. This fracture is situated in the left half of the frontal bone, but, inferiorly, it extends somewhat over the median line. In form it is about quadrilateral; and it measures 2£ x If in. Two large pieces of bone are seen to have been detached and upraised ; the upper one having been separated at the coronal suture from the parietal bone, and being so closely united that the fracture does not show upon the outer surface. The lower piece shows the line of fracture all around. Owing to the loss of bone, two openings are left in the skull; one, that separates the_149 MORBID ANATOMY. two fragments, has nearly a triangular form, extends rather across the median line, and is 4 in. in circumference ; the other, situated between the lower fragment, and the left half of the frontal bone, is long and irregularly nar- row, and is 2-| in. in circumference. The edges of the fractured bones are smooth, and there is nowhere any new deposit. 1868. Dr. John M. Harlow, of Woburn. For the bar above referred to see No. 3106. 950. A cast of the head of the above individual. Soon after Dr. H. published the case, Dr. Bigelow wrote to him, and made arrangements, at a very considerable expense to him- self, to have the man sent down to this city, and kept heie for a full examination. After he had satisfied himself that the bar had actually passed through the man’s head, and that he had essentially recovered from the accident, he was exhibited to the profession, the cast was taken, and a full account of the case, with illustrations, was published by Dr. B., in the American Jour, of Med. Sciences, July, 1850. 1856_ Dr. II. J. Bigelow. The very small amount of attention that has been given to the above wonderful case, by the profession in this country, as well as in Europe, can only be explained by the fact that it far transcends any case of recovery from injury of the head that can be found in the records of surgery. It was too monstrous for belief, and yet Dr. Harlow has at last furnished evidence that leaves no ques- tion in regard to it. 951.

The accident happened in the State of Ohio, May 14th, 1867, and the following is an abstract of the case, which was reported to Dr. Bigelow by the attending physicians, Drs. M. Jewett and F. W. Inman. The patient, a healthy and intelligent man, about twenty-seven years of age, wasMORBID ANATOMY. 150 blasting coal, when the charge exploded unexpectedly, and the pipe was driven through his head, entering at the junc- tion of the middle and outer thirds of the right supra- orbitary ridge, and emerging near the junction of the left parietal, occipital, and temporal bones. One of his fellow- miners saw him upon his hands and knees, and strueelino- • , « 7 DO O as if to rise; arid, going to his assistance, he placed his knee upon his chest, supported his head with one hand, and with the other withdrew the pipe. This last projected about equally from the front and back of the head; and much force was required for its withdrawal. On bein«- raised from the bottom of the shaft, which was about 100 ft. deep, he shivered as if he was very cold, groaned heav- ily, put both hands to his forehead, shook his head depre- catingly when spoken to, but moved his lips. Three hours after the accident Dr. I was called, and found him comatose, and in a state of collapse ; pulse 35, and weak ; respirations nine per minute, and eveiy breath seemed as if it would be the last. The right eye protruded half an inch, and blood, mixed with portions of brain, was oozing from the anterior wound, which was smooth, and about large enough to admit the index finger; the hem- orrhage, however, being inconsiderable, though free at first. Posteriorly the opening was much larger, and the bones protruded; the extent of the fracture being about 3 in. The gas-pipe (No. 3107.) was shown, and about one- half of it was smeared with blood and brain; 4 ft. 2 in. in length, and £ in. in diameter. Some spiculae of bone were removed from the back of the head ; the free use of stimuli was ordered, with cold to the head, and warmth to the extremities. On the 16th his breathing was stertorous, with a pulse of 40 ; and calomel with podophyllin was given, with beef-tea. On the 17th there was some reac- tion ; and as the medicine had had no effect, it was repeated, and, after an enema, free catharsis followed, with a taenia, 17 ft. long. On the 19th he was more restless, and, as it was difficult to keep him in bed, tart, antimony, with opium, was given. In a very few days he began to swallow what was put into his mouth ; about the twelfth day he began to take151 MORBID ANATOMY. food freely, and in about three weeks from the time of the accident he ate voraciously. A pint of whiskey was given daily for the first five days, and on the 19th reaction com- menced, with a pulse of 80. If he did not want food or whiskey, he would roll over and turn away. For six weeks the discharges from the bowels and bladdei vreie iiRolun- tary. In seven weeks he sat up, and in one moie he walked about a little. The right hand he used somewhat, but less well than the left. For about ten months after the accident his memory for some things was nearly lost, but during the next two months there was a considerable im- provement. When he was first seen, a probe, 4 in. in length, was passed into each of the wounds as far as it would leach, and without obstruction ; and the chief point in the treat- ment consisted in the frequent passage of the probe, with a view to keeping the openings perfectly free. During the first ten days the probe was passed its whole length, and daily. If the orifices, and especially the posterior one, were at any time obstructed by a plug of brain, the coma would very much increase ; and by shaving it off repeat- edly, and passing the probe, the relief would often be very o-reat. The discharge from the back wound was very con- siderable; and, as it became quite offensive, injections of chlorate of potash were frequently used. On the sixth day there was a slight ptyalism, and this Drs. J. and I. thought may have tended to prevent secondary inflamma- tion. Dr. Jewett visited Boston with the patient, at the invita- tion of Dr. Bigelow, and kindly presented to him the gas- pipe, and transferred to him the case, with liberty to make such use of it as he should see fit. Dr. B. exhibited the patient, with the gas-pipe, to the Mass. Medical Societ}*-, at their annual meeting in June, 1868, and then added the pipe to his collection in this museum ; the cast being taken subsequently. The man appeared to be in a good state of general health; and, though his mental powers were considerably impaired, there was nothing unusual in his expression, nor would there be noticed, in a few minutes’ conversation with him, any marked deficiency of intellect.152 morbid anatomy. . ° Jhad done 110 work> however, since the time of the acci- dent, and he had not fully recovered the use of his eye, nor of his right hand. Above the eye there was a small cica- tnx, and a slight irregularity to the feel of the surface of the bone. Posteriorly there was a depression, quite defined and nearly large enough to admit the top of the index inger, but without any elevation, or irregularity of the surrounding bone. Drs. Jewett and Inman delivered to Dr. Bigelow, with their report, the statements of different physicians who saw the man with them, and no one of whom had the slightest doubt of the main fact in the ease. Statements also were given by different non-professional persons. After Dr. J. returned to Ohio he sent to Dr. B. the hat that his patient wore at the time of the accident, and in it arc holes cor- responding to the openings in the skull. 1868. See No 31°7- Dr. II.

Quite conscious when first seen, without palsy, and with a pulse of 44; pupils acted. Several pieces of bone removed at the hospital (125, 164) by Dr. C.; and these, having been with the other fragments dried153 MOKBID ANATOMY. in place by Mr. John Green, one of the house-pupils, have been colored so as to be designated. On dissection, lymph and pus were found beneath the dura mater, but no lacera- tion nor inflammation of the brain itself. 1866. Dr. H. G. ClarJc. 957. A portion of the frontal bone, showing a very extensive fracture. The patient, a boy, mt. 13, fell from the roof of a house; and, when brought to the hospital (138, 88) there was great depression of, and just above, the nasal bones “ the nose seeming to have been driven into the face.” He was very nearly senseless, and otherwise se- verely injured. The depressed bone was raised by Dr. Hodges, and the patient lived until the tenth day; con- sciousness remaining, more or less, until the last thirty hours. The nasal, and small portions of the adjoining bones were found completely detached, but still connected together, as shown in the preparation. The body of the sphenoid is also seen to have been broken. The fracture extended through the base of the skull, to the occiput, and there was some separation of the lambdoidal suture, with a separate fracture upon one side of the head. Pus was found beneath the dura mater, along the longitudinal sinus ; and extensive softening of the cerebellum. 1868. * Dr. G. H. Gay. 9o8. Top of the skull, showing a very extensive and comminu- ted fracture, with fissure; and looking as if it may have been caused by blows with a hammer. Injury of the inner table very extensive. A hospital case (117, 234), and carried there at once. The man was perfectly conscious on admission, and de- scribed a muideious attack that had been made upon him. Scalp much bruised and lacerated. Brain oozing out above right ear. Pupils natural. Very cold and al- most pulseless. On the third day about the same; mass of brain discharged as large as the top of the thumb. Became unconscious that night, and remained so until he died, on the sixth day. Left side palsied, and pus issuing154 MORBID ANATOMY. from above the ear. On dissection, a large fragment of bone was found driven into the brain near the right ear ; this being replaced in the preparation. Some coagulated blood about the membranes ; and pus over the arachnoid. 1865. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 959. Fracture, with wound of the lateral sinus. The patient, a boy, fifteen years of age, had been struck by a heavy plank, and was carried at once (July 18th) to the hospital (132, 126). Scalp wound to the extent of 2 in. behind the right ear, with much hemorrhage; but he had his consciousness. Wound enlarged ; and, a depression being found upon each side of the occipital su- ture, one large triangular piece of bone was removed, and several smaller ones. The opening in the sinus was about £ in. in length, and the hemorrhage from it profuse. On the 29th there was a hemorrhage to the amount of §xij.; and another of gviij.; on the 30th one of §iij. or iv.; on the 31st one of §vj.; and on the 1st of Aug. he died with- out cerebral symptoms. The opening in the skull was of an irregularly triangular form, about 2 in. x 1£ in. The sinus traversed it horizon- tally ; and the opening in it, enlarged by inflammation and sloughing, was 1^ in. in length, contained no clot, and was smooth and perfectly healthy in appearance upon its inner surface. The dura mater, so far as exposed b}^ the frac- ture, was covered with pus and inflammatory deposits, but upon the inner surface it was healthy, though discolored. Some effused blood, however, was found upon the opposite side of the head, between the dura mater and the bone; an abscess in the muscles, at the lower part of the wound, and a fissure in the skull, an inch in length, extending from the seat of the fracture nearly to the foramen mag- num. In the preparation, the fractured bone with the dura mater, and the wounded sinus have been dried. 1867. Dr. 11. M. Uoclges. 960. Portion of the skull, fractured by a slung-shot. From a healthy man, set. twenty-one, who received the in-155 MORBID ANATOMY. jury on the 4th of May, and entered the hospital on the 7th (125, 236). On admission his pulse was 60. Pupils contracted ; and there was deafness, stupidity, inability to protrude the tongue, and a miscalling of words. On the 11th and 12th there was a convulsion, and he was then trephined. The fracture was beneath the temporal mus- cle, which was much lacerated. Bone depressed in a per- fectly regular concavity, outside of which there was no ra- diation of the lines of fracture, and within which there was much comminution. Inner table more extensively broken than the outer, and dura mater ruptured to the extent of | in.; a meningeal artery requiring ligature. The pulse rose during the operation from 48 to 135 ; and the pupils, that had been sluggish, acted promptly as soon as the com- pression was removed. On the 21st of June the man left the hospital; and on the 18th of July he resumed his work. 1866. Dr. R. M. Uoclges. 961. A skull, showing an extensive fracture of the left parietal bone, and extending through the temporal and sphenoid bones into the basilar portion of the occiput.

Portion of a skull, showing a very defined fracture, just upon the limits of the right mastoid process, very nearly an inch long, about half an inch wide, comminuted, and somewhat depressed. Inner table also comminuted, and the fragments somewhat driven in. A fissure also extends to the foramen magnum. The patient, set. forty-one, was accidentally shot, and entered the hospital at once (41, 170). Mind rather confused. External wound filled with blood, and pulsa- ting; with hemorrhage from the ear. An incision was made, and a flattened slug extracted ; considerable hemor- rhage from cranial cavity, and lateral sinus was supposed to be wounded. Died on the fifteenth day; having had delirium, with stupor most of time, and unhealthy inflam- mation about the wound. On dissection, the membranes at the seat of injury were gangrenous and inflamed, with some redness and softening of the cerebellum ; purulent infiltration of the muscles upon the right side of the thorax, and pus in the right pleural cavity. Nothing reported of the sinus. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigeluio. 966. A portion of the occiput, in which is a defined, circular opening, £ in. in diameter in the external table, and without the slightest fissure about it; the internal being broken up as usual in gun-shot fractures.

A man, mt. twenty-six, fractured his skull one and a half or two years previously; followed by epilepsy, periodic insanity, etc. Hospital case (19, 119). He remained nearly three months after the opera-MORBID ANATOMY. 157 tion ; and, when he left the hospital, his head was decidedly better, though he still became dizzy on quick motion. This, and the following cases, may be introduced here, though not cases of fracture. 1849. Dr. George Hayward. 969. A second specimen; bi-concave in form, and with a small perforation in the centre. A delicate projection of bone adhered to the dura mater, and was accidentally broken off after the operation. The patient was a clergyman, mt. forty-one, who had had epilepsy for nearly twelve years. The fits came on immediately after the healing of an ulcer on the head, and from which a piece of bone had been discharged. At first they were very frequent, and he always had a heavy and distressing sense of pressure, that was referred to the cicatrix as a centre. This last was just behind the coronal suture, upon the left side, and quite depressed. On the 17th of March, 1838, he entered the hospital, and on the 24th, Dr. H. removed the bone with the trephine; the re- lief from the feeling of pressure being immediate, and the recovery from the operation rapid, so that he left the hospi- tal on the 9th of April. The above account is from a full history of the case, by Dr. H., in the Med. Jour. (Vol. xvm. p. 325). In 1866, the patient died of an abdominal disease, from which he had suffered for several years, and on inquiry of his family the following facts were ascertained: that he began to preach about two months after leaving the hospital, contin- ued to for ten years, and was subsequently occupied in va- rious literary pursuits ; had seven or eight fits during the first ten years, and four or five subsequently, — the first in November, 1838, and the last about four years before his death; complained comparatively little of his head after the operation. 1849. Dr. Geo. Hayward. 970. A large portion of the parietal bone, with a portion of it that was removed by the trephine. This last is about two- thirds of an inch in thickness, and the parietal upon one side of the opening is seen to be much thickened.MORBID ANATOMY. 158 A hospital case (25, 64). The patient, a man set. twenty- six, fractured his skull nineteen years previously. Fol- lowed by palsy of right side for nine years ; and for some years past by epilepsy. Idiotic look, and gait shuffling. In the operation the pin could not be used, and this ex- plains the bevelled form of the cut. Patient died at the end of a week, and the dura mater was found sloughy, with pus in the membranes, and an abscess, about an inch in diameter, in the brain, beneath the seat of the operation. 1849. Dr. G. Hayward. * 971. Portion of parietal bone, from the superior anterior angle. Removed by the trephine. A hospital case (88, 57). A man set. twent37-five. Skull fractured by an axe when five years old. Epilepsy for fifteen years. Bone depressed about one-fourth of an inch. Died on, the sixth day. There is no irregularity upon the inner surface of the bone as from fracture. 1861. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 972. Top of the skull, showing an old fracture of the frontal bone, and its removal by the trephine. A hospital case (93,154). The patient, a man set. thirty- seven, met with the accident eighteen years previously. Epilepsy for the last six years. Semi-idiotic. A depres- sion at seat of injury would admit the first joint of the finger. Three pieces of bone were removed by the tre- phine ; one just above the eye, the frontal sinus being largely opened. The three openings were then connected by straight cuts; and the intervening piece of bone, the seat of the old fracture, was removed. On the eighth day cerebral S3rmptoms came on, and he died about five and one-half weeks after the operation. A cavity was found in the substance of the brain, be- neath the seat of the operation, 1^- or 2 in. in diameter, and probably recent; with some meningitis. The opening in the bone, resulting from the fracture, is about 35; in. in cir- cumference, with sharp edges, and a smooth, inner surface. The opening, resulting from the operation, is equal to 3 in. square. In the preparation, the pieces are shown in their original position. 1861. Dr. II. J Bigelow.159 MORBID ANATOMY. 973. A cranium, showing the effects of an old fracture. There is a deficiency of bone, in the right parietal, about 5^ in. long, an inch at the widest part, irregular in form, and horizontal in its direction ; anteriorly there extends from the opening to beyond the median line, something that looks like the cicatrix of a narrow fracture; the internal surface is much more irregular, and there is a peculiar ero- ded look to some distance beyond the external cicatrix. Posteriorly a cicatrized .line extends from the opening, downward into the occiput, and is much more marked in- ternally than upon the outer surface, with erosion and nmcli roughness. There is no deposit of new bone; the edges of the large opening having a smooth, cicatrized look, and the structure of the whole bone beincr quite healthy. & From a female, dissecting-room subject, about thirt}--five years of age. Corresponding to the large opening was a large and deep cicatrix externally; and anteriorly, there seemed to be a smaller one. There is a question whether this may not have been a case of burn, or of disease; but it, on the whole, appeared more like a fracture. 1859. Dr. Ii. M. Hodges. 97-1.

Portions of humerus removed for an ununited fracture; one is an inch in length, and the other about three-fourths of an inch. A hospital case (113, 220). The bone was fractured by a conical ball, in the summer of 1863, and “ considerably splintered.” About an inch was sawed off from each frag- ment, but union never took place. April 16th, 1864, Dr.164 MORBID ANATOMY. B. removed the pieces here shown ; first dissecting up and reflecting the periosteum, then drawing the fragments to- gether by a wire, and then replacing the periosteum. June 24th the man was doing well, and left the hospital. Sept. 17th he returned to have the wire removed; and the union then was quite firm. “ Dec. 16th, 1865 : The arm is per- fectly firm, and for some time the man has done a great deal of heavy lifting, such as wheeling coal, without favor- ing the injured arm in the least.” The wire is shown with the bones. 1865. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. The above was the first of eleven cases, in which Dr. Bigelow has done an operation for ununited fracture, which was original with himself, and in all of which the result was successful, excepting one (No. 1010) in which the bone was diseased. The principal points of the operation consist in a dissecting-up, and preservation, with the least N possible injury, of the periosteum, in consideration of its “ osteoplastic function; ” the drawing together of the bones, and securing them by wires, after the ends have been sawed off; and the removal of burrowing pus. These cases, all of which occurred at the Mass. Gen. Hospital, have been published by Dr. B., with remarks upon the history of the operation, and also a clinical lecture upon the subject, in the Med. Jour. Vol. lxxvi. pp. 297 and 325. 1006. A second case. The patient, a laborer, aet. twent}T-six, entered the hospital (121, 150) June 12th, 1865, and the accident happened a year before ; the fracture being com- pound, and caused by the passage of the wheel of a hand- car over his arm. At the end of six weeks it was again fractured ; and it never again united. On the 21st, Dr. B. made an incision upon the outside of the arm, turned aside the musculo-spiral nerve, stripped back the periosteum from each fragment of the bone, and sawed off1 £ in. from the lower, and ^ in. from the upper. The ends of the bone were then drilled on the outer side, and a silver wire passed through; and, the bones having been placed in apposition, the wire was twisted b}r four half-turns. The arm was then placed in an inside and out- side angular splint, and the wound closed by sutures.165 MOKBID ANATOINIY. Juty 28th an outside angular splint was applied. Aug. 7th there was slight stiffening at the seat of fracture ; and on the 22d only a slight motion could be detected. Nov. 4th, all soreness and discharge having ceased, and the humerus being perfectly stiff, the wire was cut away; and on the 29th of December he left the hospital well. The wire is shown with the bones. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 330.) 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1007. A third case. The patient, a carpenter, set. twenty-eight, entered the hospital (119, 124) Jan. 2d, 1865. There had been a simple fracture of the humerus a little below the middle of the bone, twelve weeks before, and that had been treated in the usual way by splints ; but there had never been any attempt at bony union, though the bones were found in apposition. On the 7th each fragment was drilled in three places, and an inside and outside angular splint applied; but on the 26th there was no union. Feb. 25th an incision was made along the outside of the arm, and after dissecting the ends of the bones from the periosteum, J in. was removed from the upper fragment, and an inch from the lower. Holes were then drilled, and a silver-plated copper wire was passed and twisted. The musculo-spiral nerve had been divided accidentally ; and the ends, having been brought together, were secured by a suture through the neurilemma. Several arteries were Lied ; and, after closing the wound, the arm was placed in an inside angular splint, firmly bandaged, and then upon a flat angu- lar splint, reaching from the shoulder to the hand. On the 26t.h there was great numbness over the dorsal surface of the thumb and index finger, and a general pa- ralysis of the extensors of the wrist and fingers. March 8th the wound was open throughout, with considerable in- flammation ; and the suture came away from the neurilem- ma. On the 31st there was considerable stiffness ; and on the 6th of May the arm was quite stiff. June 24th the wire was removed, and is shown with the bones ; sensibility had returned to the thumb and finger, but the extensors of the wrist and fingers were still powerless. On the 17th of March, 1866, he reported at the hospital that he had worked166 MORBID ANATOMY. at his trade since August, and without inconvenience. The arm was perfectly firm, and free from pain; and the extensors of the wrist and fingers had recovered the power of motion perfectly. The union of the musculo-spinal nerve, Dr. B. regarded as a point of great interest. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxvi. p. 329.) 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1008. A fourth case. Portions of bone removed at two differ- ent times. The patient, a soldier, received a gun-shot wound about the middle of April, 1862. The humerus having been shattered about midway, the fragments were at once re- moved, and the ends of the bones sawed off and approxi- mated. At the end of six months no union had taken place ; and the ends of the bones having been again sawn off, were wired together. In two weeks the wire was re- moved. There never was anj'- union, and when he entered the hospital (125, 22) Nov. 3d, 1865, there were several fistulae, the bone could be felt, and a few small pieces had been discharged. The arm swung freely in all directions, but there was no pain ; and the general health was excel- lent. Nov. 4th an incision was made over the lower fragment, upon the outside of the arm, and the sinuses were found xo extend down into the interior of the bone. The cavity in this last was then exposed throughout by the removal, by "the trephine, of three pieces of bone, and the interior was thoroughly scraped with a gouge. The periosteum was scraped back, and a portion of the lower fragment was removed. This last was 2£ in. in length, li in. in diame- ter, and changed in structure, as well as enlarged, by chronic inflammation; irregularly pointed toward the ex- tremity, and shows the course of the sinuses as they extended down into the interior of the bone. The perios- teum was then scraped back from the upper fragment, which was healthy, though not more than one-half its natural size, and quite pointed. A few points were nipped off; the end fitted into the cavity in the lower fragment, and the two wired together. Splints were applied so as to keep167 MORBID ANATOMY. the parts perfectly at rest, and the case seemed to be going well; but on the 20th of February the upper fragment was found to be dead, and was removed. March 31st, 1866, there was no union, and a second op- eration was performed. The cavity in the lower fragment was found to be filled up, and the wire was still firm ; but the upper fragment was free. The periosteum having been scraped back from both, a piece was sawn from the lower, If in. in length, and the same in diameter ; rough toward the end, and pointed upon one side. The portion sawn from the upper fragment was 1£ in. in length, £ in. in di- ameter, and quite pointed at the extremity. Holes were then drilled, and the fragments were wired together, but not tightly. On the 28th of April there seemed to be some stiffening; but on the 10th of June he fell upon his elbow, and broke his arm again ; and on the 15th of July he left the hospi- tal. Jan. 12th, 1867, he was readmitted; there being no union, and on the same day a third operation was per- formed. The ends of the bones were much roughened; and there was great difficulty in everting the fragments, and detaching the periosteum, on account of their shortened condition. One inch and three-fourths, however, were re- moved from the lower fragment, and it was 2 in. in diame- ter where cut across. The upper fragment was of normal size, but with fatty degeneration of the interior, and from this one inch was cut off1. The bones were then drilled and wired, and a towel was placed in the axilla to kee*p out the upper fragment. On the 13th there was almost complete paralysis of the extensors of the fingers, though no nerve was known to have been divided. The parts being kept in good position, there was slight stiffening on the 6th of February ; and on the 16th of April, the humerus being quite firm, the forearm could be flexed, and the arm raised freely from the side. The next week he left the hospital. July 3d he returned to have the wire removed, and the union was firm; but the paralysis continued. Dr. B. remarked that at the time of the first operation.168 MORBID ANATOMY. the lower fragment was reddish, dense, brittle, and amor- phous, as it is sometimes in the denuded walls of the cavity of sequestra; and that, at the end of about a year, and when dead bone could no longer be felt, the tissue was comparatively healthy, and the interior cancellated. The arm was seven inches shorter than its fellow. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 332.) The bones that were removed at the two first operations are shown ; with one of the wires. 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1009. A fifth case. The patient, aet. thirty-three, was wounded with a conical ball, at the battle of Gettysburg, July 3d 1863, and the result was a compound and comminuted fracture of the humerus. July 5th about 3 in. of the bone were removed, but the bones were not kept in apposition, and no union followed. In five months the wound healed, and never troubled him afterward; and, having resumed duty, he served out his full time with his resriment. On admission into the hospital, Jan. 26th, 1866 (125, 116), the extremities of the bone were felt, pointed and considerably absorbed; and the arm hung atrophied and useless. On the 27th the operation was performed for Dr. B. by Dr. Hodges, 1 in. being removed from one of the fragments, and 1J in. from the other; the bones, as seen in the preparation, being much atrophied. The ends were then drilled, and a silver wire was passed and twisted, allowing room for slight movement. The periosteum was returned to its place; the wound closed and dressed ; and an internal angular splint applied. Abscesses formed after the operation; but on the 31st of March the union was firm, and he left the hospital. May 23d he returned to have the wire removed ; and on the 30th of April, 1867, he wrote to say that his arm was strong, and that for months he had used it daily. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxvi. p. 331.) 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1010. A sixth case. The lower 2£ in. of the humerus, from a case of ununited fracture; the upper extremity of theMORBID ANATOMY. 169 specimen being rounded and smooth, excepting a very small cavity. The patient, a corpulent, flabby woman, ret. forty-five entered the hospital (117, 240) Nov. 10th, 1864; having- had a compound fracture eighteen months before. Seven months after the accident a seton was passed, and left in for a month ; and other means were used ; but the bone never united. The ends of the bone were drawn widely apart by the weight of the forearm, unless held in place by an apparatus that she had worn during the last seven months. On the 19th Dr. B. made an incision upon the outer back part of the arm; the ends of the bone were turned out, the periosteum dissected back from the lower fragment to the extent of about 1| in., and from the upper to that of 2 in., and the ends removed. The bones were so degenerated as to be easily cut with a knife, and the wire was therefore not twisted tightly. The arm beino- very unwieldy, it was placed upon a flat right-angled splint. ° Jan. 7th there was no stiffening, and the wire had appar- ently cut through. On the 1st of April the wire was removed ; on the 26th the arm was amputated, at the request of the patient; and on the 17th of June she left the hospital. (Med. Jour Vol. lxxvi. p. 328.) 1868.

When eight years old he injured the elbow severely ; and four or five years afterward noticed something movable in the joint, and which, in a certain position, prevented flex- ion. The elbow was quite natural in appearance, but there was something apparently bony, and about the shape of the inner condyle, between this last and the olecranon ; the condyle being much smaller than the outer one. The loose body was somewhat movable. The following record was made by Dr. B.: t£ An incision, made on the side of the olecranon, between that and the internal condyle, exposed the uneven surface of the loose body, which was removed without difficulty. It was about the size of a civet bean, and in parts quite as thick ; very rough, and almost spiculated on one side, and only unequal on the other, like the side of the olecranon itself, which it doubtless is, inasmuch as the substance is bony, and the surface here and there covered with what is, under the mi- croscope, true cartilage.

Dr. H. remarked that there are very few recorded cases of longitudinal fracture of the head of the radius ; and, of those 'that he had found, three were associated with the rare accident of fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna ; and the present specimen shows that this also might have been a fracture of the coronoid process, had the split which passed down the shaft of the ulna terminated ante- riorly' (towards which aspect it inclined, and came nearest) instead of posteriorly. 1766.

Dr. B. remarked that the bones of the wrist would act as a wedge upon the concave, articular sur- face of the radius; and that this case would explain the persistence of some cases of sprained wrist.

The upper fragment of the ulna was turned out, the periosteum scraped back, and about £ in. sawn off. About an inch onty of the lower fragment remained, but the periosteum was raised, and a very small piece of bone was removed. The ends of the radius were then sawed off (§ in. and 1£ in.), and the bones were drilled and wired. Dec. 3d the wire in the ulna broke through, and was re- moved. March 14th there was no union in either bone; and the wire was removed from the radius, with four small pieces of dead bone ; the patient having left the hospital on the 1st of February. 1868.

One ball is seen to have passed through the tibia just below the joint, which last is extensively fissured ; and for this injury the thigh was amputated on the eighteenth day. Secondly, a portion of the pelvis shows that another ball passed through, and shattered the tuberosity of the right ischium. It then traversed the pelvis, produced a deep but incom- . plete fracture of the left pubes, close to the symphisis, fell back into the cavity of the pelvis, and was afterwards ex- tracted from near the groin. The man lived twenty-two days from the time of the injury, and was found to have an extensive purulent infiltration of the cellular tissue of the pelvis, but without any injury to the peritoneum, blad- der, or any of the large vessels or nerves. (Hospital, 126, 242.) 1866 Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1053. A portion of the pelvis, showing a comminuted fracture through the acetabulum, from the great sacro-ischiatic notch to the obturator foramen, and an extension of the fracture along the upper portion of the acetabulum, that nearly separated the ilium. The whole posterior portion of the acetabulum is broken off in one piece. The head of the femur, a portion of which last is shown, is deeply in- dented upon its anterior surface, as the head of the hume- rus sometimes is in dislocation ; the outline being quite de- fined, as if it had struck against some sharp edge of bone. At the time of the dissection a portion of the pelvis was displaced backward, and the head of the femur followed it. From a man, set. thirty-six years, who fell from the roof of the barracks, at the Charlestown navy-yard, struck upon his right side, and died in forty-eight hours. A hospital case (88, /2). The limb was shortened, the foot inverted, the toes resting upon the instep of the other foot, the knee semiflexed, and he was unable to move the limb on account' of pain. Six of the ribs were also fractured, and there were several superficial lacerations of the liver. 1860. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 1054.

Loose bone was removed from the trochanter, and he died on the fourth day. A hospital case (106, 86). In the preparation the trochanter is quite gone, and the shaft of the bone is somewhat injured. The ischium is also broken, and a portion of the tuberosity has been car- ried away. 1864. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1055. A partial fracture or fissure in the neck of the femur, in a man forty-two years of age ; the upper half of the bone is shown. There wras also a transverse fracture of the same bone, midway, and a fracture of the spine. The patient, a laborer, fell through two stories of a building, upon a hard floor ; entered the hospital (67, 212), and died on the eighteenth day from the accident. The fissure involves about three-fourths of the circum- ference of the neck, the inner anterior portion only being spared ; and to a considerable extent it runs along very near to the head of the bone. It is quite closed, but there is considerable motion between the head and neck, when the head and shaft are grasped, and moved upon each other ; and the fissure would undoubtedly result in a per- fect fracture if much force were used. From the fracture of the shaft, midway, a fissure extends upward and toward the neck; but it does not meet the one above described. This case has been reported, and the specimen figured in a paper upon Fractures of the Femur, by Prof. R. D. Mussey, in the Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc. for April, 1857. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv.

The shell of the neck was driven into the head half an inch posteriorly, and the head is bent upon the neck so as to open the line of fracture in front nearly one- fourth of an inch. The central portion of the head of the bone was also driven three-fourths of an inch into the less compact, cancellated structure of the neck ; and altogether the impaction was such that considerable force was required to separate the fragments; these last being now perma- nently fixed in *the position in which they were before the separation, and with some eversion. From a woman, set. seventy-six, who fell upon the right trochanter, and two days afterwards entered the hospital (107, 84) under the care of Dr. Gr. There was eversion of the limb, with shortening of half an inch; and the pa- tient, who regarded the injury as nothing more than a se- vere bruise, died in two weeks of pneumonia.

The patient was a female, set. eighty-four years, and the accident happened from a slight cause. There was strong eversion, shortening apparently to the extent of 2 in., and such severe pain that etherization was necessary before she could be removed to her bed ; crepitus then was distinct. A weight was attached to the limb, and she became quiet; but pain, more or less severe, continued until she became unconscious, a day or two before death, which occuiied on the twentieth day ; large bed-sores forming from the irrita- tion of the urine with which she was constantly kept wet. 1gg9> Dr. B.

The patient was ninety-three years old, very feeble, and lived a month from the time of the accident, which was probably caused by her slipping from a rocking-chair. There was no crepitus, never any shortening, and but little pain ; but there was some swelling of the limb, and poste- riorly extensive ecchymosis. The fracture is very nearly at the union of the neck with the shaft; a large portion of the great trochanter is also broken off; and the trochanter185 MORBID ANATOMY. minor is so comminuted as not to be recognizable. Some new bone is thrown out in various places, but without union. The articular surface is somewhat eburnated ; and upon the neck is some caries, that was probably connected with a large effusion of pus and offensive matter, that was found amongst the muscles about the upper half of the thigh, and in the cavity of the bone.

Cast, in plaster, of the upper portion of the femur, show- ing a fracture of the neck of the bone, and in which there was osseous union; a case in which there has been much difference of opinion as to the seat of the fracture. This case was fully reported by the late Prof. R. D. Mussey, in the Amei’ican Jour, of Med. Sc. for April, 1857, with three figures; and copied, with the same, by Dr. Hamilton, in his work on Fractures, etc. The patient, a man seventy years of age, fell upon his left hip from a wagon, and Dr. J. C. Dalton, of Lowell, who saw him, le- ported eversion, crepitus, and shortening by more than an inch. Four or five days afterward he was carried home more than a hundred miles ; and eighteen days after the accident Prof. M. saw him. He found considerable ever- sion, very little pain, and no shortening. The man could support the limb upon the floor for a minute or two, as he stood erect, and Prof. M. thought that there was no frac- ture. In four months he could walk with a cane; and three years and eight months afterward (Dr. D.’s statment) he died of internal disease. The neck is much shortened, and the head more than half an inch below the top of the trochanter ; shaft rotated outward ; head £ in. from intertrochanteric line posteriorly, and If in. anteriorly. A section showed perfect consolida- tion by bone. The specimen has been examined by vari- ous surgeons in Europe, as well as in this country, and their various opinions are given by Prof. M. When this case was entered in the manuscript catalogue of the museum, in the year 1850, Dr. Dalton furnished a history of it, in which he described a shortening of at least 2£ in., a ready reduction, but an immediate return of the limb to its former position, and an entire loss ol power below the hip ; crepitus was not alluded to. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.187 MORBID ANATOMY. 1086. A fracture that, in the recent state, must have very closely resembled No. 1057, and strongly united by bone. From a woman, set. seventy, who fell upon her side, and was thought unequivocally by Dr. C. to have fractured the neck of the bone, when he saw her soon after the accident. He did not wish to distress the patient by making a crit- ical examination of the limb, but founded his diagnosis simply on the total loss of power that she had over it. For two and a half or three months she was kept upon her back, with the knee flexed, and two pillows beneath it; and then she began to sit up, with the limb extended. Crutches were afterwards used ; then a crutch and a cane ; and for the last two and a half years she used neither, though she was able to go about the house, and somewhat out of doors, limping a very little, but without any pain. There was, however, a great deal of pain during the first few weeks after the fracture. Her general health had been quite good; and she died, of internal disease, four years and seven months from the time of the accident. After her death there was a shortening of the limb to the extent of about three-fourths of an inch, but no eversion was noticed. The head of the bone is depressed, and bent obliquely downwards and backwards towards the lesser trochanter, with rotation outwards of the shaft. Anteriorly the neck projects somewhat beyond the margin of the head, whilst posteriorly it is impacted beneath it, and into the head; leaving a fissure, or separation of the fragments at the seat of fracture, as usual. A longitudinal section having been made through the middle of the head and great trochanter, and in front of the small trochanter, the cut surface shows throughout a most complete bony union. Upon the posterior half the cortex or outer shell of the neck extends quite across this surface. Upon the other half it extends nearly one-half across, from below, and beyond this the cancellated struc- ture is as continuous with that of the neck as if the bone had never been broken. This case, and No. 1057, have been reported by Dr. H. J. Bigelow, in his work on Dislocation and Fracture of the188 MORBID ANATOMY. I-Iip, and the specimens have been figured as they appear externally. The section was very much nearer to the posterior than to the anterior face, and, since the above was in print, a second has been made through the anterior half of the bone ; but the result is about the same. 1869. Dr. Benjamin Cushing. 1087-8. Fracture of the neck, within the capsule; section. The anterior half has been dried, and includes the whole cir- cumference of the neck at the seat of fracture ; the posterior parietes of the neck extending across the section as a com- pact line of bone. Along the external surface of this line the cancellated structure of the neck is united, firmly and throughout, though only to a limited extent; the head being thus immovably fixed upon the shaft. The neck is almost entirely absorbed. Upon the outer surface of this anterior half there is a deep fissure between the fragments, from which a dense fibro-cellular tissue was removed, in the preparation of the specimen, and that would seem to have been the result of eversion. The separation amounted, at the maximum point, to about half an inch, and the oppos- ing surfaces are rough. The other half of the bone is in spirit, and shows the dense tissue that closely unites the fragments, but there is no bony union, and the head con- siderably overlaps the neck of the bone. The following is an abstract of a history of this case, which, with remarks, and a drawing of the specimen, was published by Dr. W. in the Mass. Med. Society’s edition of Sir A. Cooper’s work on Dislocations and Fractures of the Joints. The patient was a gentleman, seventy years of age, who fell and struck upon the left trochanter as he was ascending the steps of the State House. He was able, however, to walk up to the Senate Chamber, where he remained an hour and a half, and took part in the debates, but was then obliged to go home in a carriage, and Dr. W. saw him. There was no change in the appearance of the limb, no crepitus, and only a moderate pain on strong outward rota- tion or strong flexion of the thigh upon the pelvis. Di.MORBID ANATOMY. 189 W. regarded it as a fracture within the capsule, but never thought it necessary to apply any apparatus. For some days the patient persisted in getting out of bed, as he could not believe that there was a fracture ; and he would also frequently, in the course of treatment, move the limb by moving his whole body for the sake of experiment, and in spite of remonstrances. There was no eversion nor shortening ; and as, at the end of eight or nine months, the pain on motion, and the tenderness had diminished, he was advised to move from the bed to the sofa ; but it was about two months before he would make the trial. From this time he improved so that he was afterward frequently able to drive out, though he had to be carried down-stairs ; and he could swing the limb freely, when supported, though he could not bear his weight upon it, nor use crutches. Death finally occurred two years and a half after the acci- dent ; and after an illness of three days. On dissection, the capsular ligament was thickened, and a slight rising of the bone, just at the edge of the articular surface, indi- cated the line of the fracture. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1089. Upper portion of the femur, from a case of old fracture. The neck is so far absorbed, that the head approaches the small trochanter very nearly, and at that part there is bony union to a considerable extent. Otherwise the upper frac- tuied suiface, close to the head, in its present macerated and dried condition, is rough ; whereas the lower or oppo- site surface is smooth, and the cancelli are covered over by a thin layer of bone. The two surfaces are but little sep- arated from each other. The whole bone is very light in structure, and shows that there had been outward rotation. 1 be following history of the case was received from Dr. Charles L. Ivnowlton, of Ashfield, after the death of his father, who sent the specimen to Dr. B. The patient was eighty-three years old, and fell at her door ; and, when seen I13 Di. K., Sen., shortly afterward, the fracture was recog- nized. There was very marked shortening, eversion of the foot, and much pain when the limb was moved, for about a }e.u after the accident. Her health then improved, and190 MORBID ANATOMY. there was little or no pain. Died in 1846, after a short sickness, seventeen months after the accident. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigeloio. 1090. Old and ununited fracture of the neck of the femur; a portion of the pelvis being preserved with the bone. Pre- pared by Dr. Cheever. In spirit, and described by Dr. Bigelow: — u rphis specimen shows in a remarkable manner the ilio- femoral or Y ligament, and the obturator internus muscle, in their relations to the displaced bone, in a case of old and unimpacted fracture of the neck of the femur. The neck is wholly absorbed, leaving within the socket, to rep- resent the head of the bone, a movable hemisphere, with a smooth, flat, external surface. In direct contact with this is the shaft of the femur, which, by attrition, has become excavated. The whole neck having been absorbed, the fe- mur slides upon the flattened head to the extent of an inch or two; the contiguous flbro-cartilaginous surfaces being quite smooth. . , « A point of great interest in this specimen is the mech- anism by which this motion is limited. The patient stand- ing in an upright position, the weight of the body was of course suspended by the ligamentous fibres. Upon careful dissection, these are found to consist, m part, of the cap- sule of the joint, and in part of the obturator internus muscle; each of which may be here separately described. The capsule of the joint, while thin upon its lower aspect, and contributing little to the support of the body, is quite thick at its upper part; the Y ligament being developed in a remarkable manner. Although the lower branch of the y usually described as the ilio-femoral ligament, and commonly the stronger of the two, is here comparatively atrophied, the outer and upper branch is hypertrophied to a remarkable degree, and has obviously been the princi- pal agent in suspending the weight of the body. cunous confirmation is thus afforded of the existence of this outer band which I have elsewhere described as playing so i - p" part in dislocations of the hip. The outer and upper part of the capsule is also somewhat developed.MOKBLD ANATOMY. 191 “ A second point of interest is the development of the obturator internus muscle, which is enlarged and elon- gated so as to form a posterior suspensory ligament. The body was obviously slung in this case between the exter- nal Y ligament in front, and the obturator internus muscle behind. And the tendinous material of the latter is so developed as to justify its description as a tendon inserted at its small extremity into the trochanteric fossa, while it is expanded at its large extremity into a firm fascia over- laid with muscle, and which covers the foramen ovale and adjacent bone. The important part performed by this muscle, in this specimen, corroborates the view I have elsewhere taken of its function in dislocation of the hip. “ Having described the agencies by which the body is suspended, it only remains to add that the inner and atro- phied branch of the Y ligament may have served in this case, and in default of other ligamentary fibres, to limit abduction, and especially extension of the femur.” 1865. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1091. A second specimen. Upper part of the femur ; in spirit. The neck, which is almost entirely absorbed, seems to Lave been broken within the capsule; and, the capsular liga- ment being thickened, and firmly adherent about the seat of injury, a close and firm fibro-cellular union must have taken place ; the motion being now inconsiderable. There is strong eversion, and the centre of the head is about 1* in. below the top of the great trochanter, which last is also partially broken.

Slight concavity where the neck should be. Most of the head remains as a de- tached piece ; and the opposing surfaces, as well as the original articular surface are smooth, though somewhatMORBID ANATOMY. 192 irregular; there being a considerable osseous deposit about the edges as from chronic arthritis. In the recent state the head was connected with the acetabulum, and also with the shaft by light and long bands of fibro-cellular tissue. 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1093. A fourth specimen. The patient, when eighty years of age, fell from a low chair upon the floor, and never walked afterward, except by pushing a chair before her ; being un- able to use crutches. Limb shortened 3 or 4 in. Little or no pain for two or three j7ears ; but, for two years before her death, which occurred five years and a half after the accident, the pain was extreme, and of a neuralgic char- acter. The bones having been macerated, there is seen to be a complete absorption of the neck, as usual in such cases; the new articular surfaces being very uneven, and with some eburnation, especially upon the shaft. Upon the original articular surface of the head is a considerable de- posit of new bone, as from chronic arthritis. 1860. Dr. H. E. Claj), of Wrenthcim. 1094.

The neck of the bone has been entirely absorbed, and the head rested and probably moved freely upon the shaft as far down as the small trochanter; there having been no attempt at union. The articular surface was somewhat eburnated, but mainly covered with a tissue that looked not very unlike cartilage, though the microscope showed it to be only a condensed fibrous substance. At the time of the dissection, a hollow was observed among the muscles above the femur, and into which this bone would crowd when the patient walked. From a man, over sixty years of age, and who, eleven yeais befoie liis death, was crushed down by a very lar«e and heavy weight, that fell directly upon him. There was. 13194 MORBID ANATOMY. not much motion between the fragments, but enough to show considerable comminution. A closely fitting swathe was applied, with such extension as wras practicable to keep the limb quiet, and after some weeks he was able to get up, and gradually move about on crutches. After a time he could get along with two canes, and this he did until his last sickness, — walking sometimes several miles at a time. He finally died with some affection of the heart and kidneys. 1869< Dr. B. E. Cotting. 1100.

A considerable quantity of new and .soft bone connects this upper frag- ment with the shaft above the inner condyle. From an intemperate man, oet. thirty-seven years, who slipped and fell with the whole weight of his body upon this limb. On entrance into the hospital (28, 331) Dec. 20th, 1844, there was a shortening of 2 or 3 in., consider- able swelling and emphysema about the knee, and a pro- trusion of the upper fragment nearly an inch, with great pain, and considerable bleeding. The fracture was re- duced, but the bones could hardly be kept in place; and on the third “day, the extension being discontinued, on account of the pain and swelling, the limb was simply laid in a fracture box. Suppuration and sloughing followed. Feb. 5th the limb was much shortened, and the upper frag- ment seemed to have penetrated the knee-joint beneath the patella. On the 11th of March it protruded below this bone, and on the 11th of April the man died. 1847. Dr. J. 0. Warren. 1119.

On laying the parts open, however, the finger could be passed freely about in the popliteal space; and the injury being evidently very extensive, the limb was amputated six or eight hours after the accident, and the patient did well. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1123. Comminuted fracture of the inner condyle, with a conical ball in the middle and back part of the knee-joint. The patient, an army officer, entered the hospital (106, 92) fourteen days after a wound, just above, and upon the inside of the knee. Two days after admission a large amount of pus was discharged through an opening upon the outside of the knee, and the inner condyle, which was found loose, was removed. Nine days after admission the limb was amputated by Dr. H.; and three or four days aftei waid severe chills came on, followed by dyspnoea, yellowness of the skin, and delirium. Six days after the operation he died. The ball was found tying in the joint; the patella was fractured ; and there was an extensive infiltration of pus into the soft parts. (Med. Jour.

A very marked, defined, and regular enlargement of the tibia, in its lower third, about 2 in. in extent, involving equally the whole circumference, and that may be called fusiform. Having been sawed longitudinally by Dr. Hodges, the walls of the bone, at the affected part, are dense as well as thickened; and the cavity, though not203 MORBID ANATOMY. perfectly obliterated, is filled with a denser cancellated ' structure than elsewhere. The bone is otherwise quite healthy; and, though the idea of a syphilitic node has been suggested, there can be no reasonable doubt that the bone had been fractured. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1154. Abrupt and very marked curvature of the shaft of the fibula; and possibly the result of fracture. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1155. Old fracture of the tibia, just below the middle of the bone, and followed by periostitis. Surface rough ; and the lower half much enlarged and porous. On section,’the cavity is seen to be obliterated, and the walls of the lower fragment are quite thin. The irregularity at the seat of fracture is slight, and externally hardly perceptible, in con- sequence of the extensive and very thick periosteal deposit, so that the existence of a former fracture would be very questionable, if the fact were not known. The patient was a healthy man, about forty-five years of age, and had his limb amputated in 1861. Twelve years previously he had a compound fracture of both bones, with extensive laceration of the soft parts, and never worked from that time. An ulcer formed, which never healed, and the whole limb became swollen, oedematous, and livid. Health quite good since the operation. 1864. Mr. J. H. Chandler, med. student. 1156.

A very interesting appearance in this specimen is the action of the absorbents upon the bone that is dead, showing that originally the separation was to have taken place lower down than where it was going on at the time of amputation or death. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1158. Fracture of the tibia and fibula; not old. A considera- ble quantity of new bone is seen upon the surface of the fragments ; and the fibula is united, but the tibia is not; a separation of dead bone is going on from both fragments of the tibia. 1858. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1159. Both bones fractured at about the lower third; from a young subject. Union irregular, and rather imperfect. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1160. A preparation, by Dr. H., showing the result of a neg- lected fracture. The foot is strongly flexed upon the leg ; the tibia is bent to a right, and the fibula to an acute, angle ; and the union, though very close, is not osseous. The patient, a healthy lad, sixteen years of age, was observed, when two or three days old, to have some trouble with his leg, and soon afterward the fibula was found to be broken. No treatment. At the age of two years the leg began to yield, and in six months it was bent to a right angle. When he was eight years old, the bones were re- moved at the angle, the tendo-achillis was cut, and for a time it was kept in proper position. The mother, however, entirely neglected the child, and the leg was soon nearly as bad as ever. Last year Dr. II. amputated the limb, and the lad has since done well with a Palmer’s leg. 1857. Dr. J. E. Hathaway, of Worcester. 1161. Cast, in plaster, of a foot and leg, that must have most remarkably resembled the last case. The patient, a little girl, eleven years of age (Hospital, 57, 102), broke her leg when six years old; and, her mother being a drunkard, nothing was done for her. The tibia seemed to have been broken about 2£ in., and theMOEBID ANATOMY. 205 fibula about iu. above the joint; and the union was firm. The lower fragments were bent strongly forward upon the dorsum of the foot, and the upper fragments were united to them at a right angle. The bones were forcibly broken down, the tendo-achillis was cut, and the parts kept in proper position, but the result was only partially satis- . factory. 1856. Dr. H. G. Clark. 1162. A third case, in which the fragments are bent upon each other, and the lower one upon the foot, precisely as in the two above cases. A ligamentary preparation. The patient was a delicate girl, twenty-two years of age, and one of the lowest prostitutes. The bones were broken when she was five or six years old, and her case was entirely neglected. In the spring of 1862, Dr. Carney, who was then the physician of the Bridgewater State Alms- house, cut out about 1 in. each of the tibia and fibula; the tibia being very sharply flexed, and closely united, though not by bone. (See next specimen.) The limb, which was sti aightened, was 1^- in. longer than before, and union was progressing well. Six weeks after the operation, Dr. C. lesigned his situation ; and his successor, finding the union incomplete, rubbed the ends of the bones together, with a view to complete it, and continued this treatment for three weeks. From the time that she left B. she walked without Clutches, and flat upon the sole of the foot; limb bowed outward, and very much shortened, but much less than before the operation ; considerable stiffness at seat of frac- ture. The union is seen to be very close, but it is not osseous. In January, 1866, the patient died at another almshouse. 1866. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 1163. Fragments of bone, from the last case. 1867.

Very extensive dislocation between the two first cervical vertebrae ; probably the result of chronic disease. A cast in plaster; the original having been purchased in Paris by Prof. R. D. Mussey. When the atlas is horizontal, the body of the axis is thrown backward at an angle of about 45°; the spinous processes being separated to the extent of hall an inch, and the odontoid, which is very much altered in form and position, approaching to within about one-fourth to one-twelfth of an inch of the arch of the atlas. Anteriorly, the body of the axis was considerably separated from that of the atlas, but the two were connected by deli- cate bony fibres. The articulating processes were anchy- losed. 1854.

Scapula, and upper part of the humerus, from the above case. A large amount of new bone has been thrown out upon the inner surface of the first, and just below the cora- coid process ; and the articular surface thus formed is con- cave, irregular and porous, but solid in structure. The surface of the glenoid cavity is cpiite irregular, but not re- duced in size. The coracoid process is large ; and the un- der surface, which is irregular, and with a trace of eburna- tion, had formed a part of the new articular surface. The upper part of the scapula shows a recent fracture, and the body of the bone seems to be atrophied. The great tuber- osity of the humerus is entirely effaced ; the head is large and misshapen, and the whole surface is irregular, with only a trace of eburnation. A small portion only of the head had been in contact with the new articular surface; and upon the back part a groove is formed by the throwing out of new bone, and corresponding to the edge of the glenoid cavity. In the recent state the head of the bone Liy quite free in the new cavity ; covered for the most part 'with a soft, red, fleshy tissue, and without cartilage.

The false joint upon the inner surface of the scapula is strongly marked, and about on a level with the glenoid cavity, which last is about one-half destroyed; mostly rough, but in part eburnated. The coracoid process, which is broad, and upon the upper surface rough, is upon the under surface continuous with the false joint, and eburna- ted almost throughout. The head of the humerus is large and misshapen, and without any appearance of the gieat tuberosity or neck ; surface partly eburnated, but elsewhere quite irregular. The capsular ligament, which has been preserved, shows several deposits of new bone. Prepaied by Dr. H. 1858. Dr- R- M- Hodges. 1174.

Bones of the upper extremity, from a case, probably, of old dislocation inward of the elbow. The outer portion of the humerus, with the condyle, is entirely destroyed, and in their place is a rough and irregular surface. The inner condyle seems to have been absorbed ; and the olecranon cavity is being obliterated. The coronoid and olecranon processes are very much thickened, and the whole articular surface of the ulna much reduced in size, — the inner por- tion being quite beyond the limits of the humerus. The head of the radius is enlarged, the margin broad and pro- jecting mei the neck, and the whole is inclined outward. About, the centre of the lower surface of the humerus is a shallow cavity for the head of the radius ; and a portion of the art. surface remains for a portion of that of the ulna.210 MOItBID ANATOMY.

It was entirely separated from the radius ; the radial artery and nerve, and the extensor tendons of the three first fingers being se\- ered. On the 1st of February it had quite healed, with anchylosis upon the radial side ; and the patient Anally got a very fair use of the hand, though it never could be fully extended. 1865. Dr. George J. Arnold, of Roxbury. 1179. A dislocated semi-lunar bone. From a man, who fell eight or ten feet, put out his band to save himself, and struck his wrist upon some loose stones. A wound upon the palmar aspect, about 2 in. in length, was the result, and the bone, which lay in the wound, was retained only by a few shreds of tissue. The cuneiform bone was loosened, but easily replaced, and two small fragments of it are seen attached to the semi- lunar. The other bones were uninjured, and none of the tendons were ruptured, but there was an unnatural mobility of the wrist-joint, and the void left by the dislocated bone was easily detected, especially upon the back of the wrist; there being neither swelling nor deformity. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. C., and the bone was removed by Dr. Hodges about four hours after the acci- dent. On the sixth day swelling and inflammation com- menced; suppuration of the cellular tissue as high as the shoulder was the result, and the man died on the tenth tU Dr. H. remarked on the rarity of compound dislocation of a single carpal bone, except as the result of gun shot oi machinery wounds; the accident being caused in the few cases that he quoted, and with one exception, by a fa upon the palm of the extended hand ; and the semi-lunaiMOEBID ANATOMY. 211 bone being generally the one that was dislocated.

The os calcis, just behind its articulation with the cuboid bone, shows a large and very marked articular surface, and there is a corresponding one upon the very lower extremity of the fibula. There is a little twist of the tibia, induced by the inward revolution of the astragalus. Lower extrem- ity of the fibula much enlarged, and directly in front of its articulation with the os calcis is a growth of new bone as large as the last joint of the finger.

Enlargement of the jaw soon com- menced, increased from that time, and, on admission, ex- tended from the right coronoid process to much beyond the median line upon the left side ; but with no pain after the first three or four months. The bone was removed at once by Dr. B. from the articulation upon the right side to the first molar tooth upon the left, and in about five weeks the patient was discharged well. This year (1867) she has been heard from, and there has been no return of disease. The bone is regularly enlarged, excepting the coronoid process and the articular portion ; structure compact, but rather coarse ; surface rather rough, but nowhere carious. A wedge of bone was sawed out at the time of the opera- tion, in order to ascertain the character of the disease. 1^7. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1197.

The left humerus and the greater part of the right femur, showing a separation of the epiphyses, etc.; the result of acute inflammation of five weeks’ duration. The patient was a delicate lad, eleven years of age, and on the 15th of August, 1834, the disease commenced. On the T8th, there were active constitutional symptoms, with pain in the right thigh and some in the joints. On the 20th, he was seen by Dr. James Jackson, and of his detailed report of the case the present history is an abstract. There were then the indications of periostitis about the femur; swelling with some hardness, heat, and extreme tenderness. On the 31st, Dr. J. found him greatly reduced ; thigh about the same, and a similar affection of the right arm, with some extension to the forearm. On the 5 th of Sept., the arm was better and the thigh less swollen, but with signs of deep-seated suppuration below the trochan- ter. On the 8th, suppuration about left shoulder-joint, with a projection as from dislocation forward of the bone; swelling of thigh greatly diminished, as from an absorption of the pus ; pain urgent; greatly reduced ; punctured left shoulder, and discharged two ounces of healthy pus ; theI 216 MORBED ANATOMY. swelling of right elbow having returned, this also was punc- tured and discharged the same amount of pus. Death on the 19th. On dissection, the shaft of the left humerus was found separated and thrown forward. No disease in the joint, though there was a cavity between the head and the shaft that contained thick pus. The condyles were also sep- arated, and between them also and the shaft was a cavity containing pus. Periosteum separated from some parts of the humerus. Forearm dislocated toward the inside, and the olecranon somewhat denuded. Upon the right side, pus was found between th^ acromion and the humerus; also about an inch below the joint, and there the periosteum was removed. The elbow was very much as it was upon the other side. The trochanter major was separated from the shaft, and between the two was a cavity that contained pus, and that extended to where the fluctuation was felt on the 5th of Sept. Hip-joint healthy, excepting some discol- oration. Periosteum extensively separated from the shaft. Upon the left side the great trochanter was also separated, though less perfectly than upon the right, and there was a smaller quantity of pus between it and the shaft. The lungs contained numerous small purulent deposits, with some acute pleurisy upon the left side. The two bones above referred to have been dried and show the trochanter separated, but the head of the femur still attached ; neck carious and surface generally rough as from inflammation. The surface of the humerus is less dis- eased. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1199.

Began with “ fever,” and two weeks afterward severe pain in knees and feet, extending to right hip ; the thigh becoming very much swollen and the pain intensely severe. On dissection, a bloody fluid was found in the hip-joint, and the cartilage mostly gone, though in some parts it was quite healthy, and lay like a loose flap upon the subjacent bone. Head of femur to some extent destroyed. Both knee-joints were similarly affected ; the bone being of a deep-red color just below the surface, the deeper parts in- filtrated with a yellowish serum. A large collection of pus was also found between the muscles and periosteum above each knee. The upper third of the head of the femur seems to have been destroyed by caries, with some exten- sion of disease to the neck. Cancelli exposed, and with- out a trace of new deposit. 1859. Dr. 0.

The lower portion of the bone, to the extent of 4 in. or more, is diseased, except the posterior walls, which are healthy. There is a very marked enlargement, roughness, and irregularity of the surface; and, having been sawed longitudinally, the parietes are seen to be cancellated.

Swelling, pain, ulcers, and sinuses for eighteen months.224 MORBID ANATOMY. The whole limb was found much swollen ; and, to the feel, the bones were much enlarged. The boy, previously, had become much reduced'and died a month after admission. On dissection, the organs were found pale, and the liver large, light-yellow, and very fat. Tissues about the bones condensed, with numerous abscesses. The bones, having been prepared by Dr. Ellis, the whole femur, excepting the articular portions, is seen to be much enlarged and mis- shapen ; surface rough and irregular, with large foramina for the nutrient vessels ; several cloacae, at the bottom of which small portions of dead bone are generally seen, but of which one only is loose ; structure generally rather light. It appears as if a large periosteal deposit may have taken place; and just above the condyles, anteriorly, this is de- tached from the surface beneath. The tibia is much less diseased than the femur ; healthy toward upper extremity, and lower half most diseased. Posteriorly there seems to be caries to the extent of several inches, but nowhere to any great width. The fibula, which is not preserved, was slightly enlarged toward the lower extremity- 1859.

From a man mt. twenty- seven, who injured his leg nineteen years before entrance into the hospital (126, 274). Inflammation followed, and for the first six years there was an occasional discharge of bone. Had done no work for the last six months. On ad- mission, the knee was bent to a right angle ; bone enlarged and bowed inward ; skin tense, discolored and cicatrized ; discharge profuse, and through the openings dead bone was felt. Dr. H. amputated above the knee, and in seven weeks the man was discharged, but with some inflammation of the stump, and dead bone; his general health havino- never been good. The bone is enlarged throughout. Upper half mostly diseased, and especially toward the back; being very rough from caries, and with small pieces Of dead but not loose bone. 1867. Dr, R, M% Eodges 1239. Old disease of the tibia, from a man set. fifty-eight, who entered the hospital Feb. 14th, 1868 (134, 184). When about twelve years old he injured his leg, and there was swelling from that time. Twelve years before entrance he had compound fracture of both bones of the leg, and at the seat of injury, which was about the junction of the middle and lower thirds. In four years the limb was sound, but thiee years afterwards a small sore formed, and kept open fiom that time. Five weeks before admission the lea- became much swollen, painful, red, and (edematous; and iee days afterward the sore increased and the discharge became abundant; the leg, on admission, being twice the size of the other, and with a foul ulcer upon it, of which the diseased tibia formed the base. On the 15th, Dr. B. removed the diseased bone, some of W 11C ~essively hard ; and on the 12th of March the man left the hospital.

Re- covered in two years, but subject to inflammation from that time, though he never again had any openings until a year before, when they appeared in various parts of the leg, with discharge of bone. When seen, the bone was very much enlarged, and the openings very numerous. Dr. U commenced an operation for necrosis, but finally amputated at the knee-joint. Condyles of the femur diseased, and were removed with the patella. Discharged well m ax. weeks and a half; but soon returned with ulceration of the stump, and four months after the operation died with typhoid fever. . ' The bone is very much enlarged and misshapen, veiy rough and porous upon the surface, and partly from caries , some dead bone in two or three places, with cloacte 1 struc- ture light; articular surfaces diseased. On transverse sec- tion, the bone consists throughout of a coarse, cancellated structure; being nowhere compact.

The structure of the bone around the cavity is compact to a considerable extent; and the central cavity commences lower than usual. Externally, and corresponding to the cavit}7, the bone is rough from a new deposit; head flat- tened, and the neck shortened and much more in a line with the shaft than usual.

Where it has been cut across, the cavity is oblit- erated, but upon the surface is seen the defined, round opening of a fistulous canal, that extends downward through the substance of the bone, and opens upon the posterior surface just above the condyles. It may have originated in such a cavity as is shown in the last spec- imen. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1284. Chronic inflammation of the tibia. From a man, set. twenty-four years (Hospital, 106, 64). Thirteen years before entrance he struck his ankle, and within a few days had pain, swelling and abscess. Several months afterward pieces of bone began to come away from about the ankle, and along the spine of the tibia, and so on for two or three years, but not since. The ulcers, how- ever, remained open, and the leg had been woi’se. When seen, his general health was impaired ; leg and ankle much enlarged, and the surface diseased. Amputation 3 in. be- low the knee ; followed after a time by chills, hemorrhage, and an appearance of sloughing; and at the end of three weeks by death. The tibia is uneven, and deformed as from chronic un- healthy inflammation. Anchylosed to astragalus, and low- er end of fibula. On long, section, a cavity is seen in the very lower extremity of the tibia, rough upon the inner surface, and capable of holding § i or ij ; and a smaller one is seen in the astragalus.

A portion of the lower jaw, showing the effects of chronic ostitis ; including in extent the right canine, and the first molar tooth upon the left side, and probably removed dur- ing life. The disease is situated almost entirely upon the outer surface of the bone, and consists of an enlargement of its substance, and a change of structure; forming a tu- mor equal to 1£ in. in diameter. Upon the inner, and along the under surface, the bone generally looks compact and healthy, though there is some enlargement toward the mouth. On transverse section, the compact wall has for the most part disappeared, and the mass is seen to consist of a pretty hard bone, mixed with the dried remains of a dense, fleshy substance; this last being intimately con- nected with the surrounding soft parts. Rather in front of the left canine, and which, with the adjoining incisor, has been removed, is a cavity of some size in the substance of the bone ; the opening from this having a fistulous ap- pearance before the specimen was dried. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1287. Lower portion of the femur, with the surrounding soft parts ; in spirit. The bone is enlarged, and to some extent consists of little more than a mere shell; being occupied by a cavity that, about in the situation of the condyles, communicates freely with another in the soft parts, and which last extends about 7 in. along the front of the bone.236 MORBID ANATOMY. The bone appears healthy where sawed across. Knee-joint probablj7 bent to an acute angle during life, as the articular surfaces, to some extent, look directly backward. These last are generally sufficiently healthy, though partly con- nected by cellular adhesions. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1288. Chronic inflammation of the femur. From a man, forty- two years of age. Disease of fifteen or sixteen years’ du- ration. Lower portion of thigh enlarged, with an offensive, sanious discharge. General appearance of necrosis, though no bone had been discharged. The enlargement begins just above the middle of the bone, and extends to the condyles ; the surface being quite rough posteriorly. About 3 in. above the condjdes, ante- riorly, is a defined opening, about three lines in diameter, and leading upward into a cavity within the bone; the structure of the bone being generally health}'. 1855. Dr. W. N. Lane, of Charlestown. 1289. Extensive necrosis of the femur. From a man twenty- seven years of age. (Hospital, 110,130, and Med. Jour. vol. lxxii. 129.) At the age of fifteen he jumped from a wall, and the shock was followed by severe inflammation, ab- scesses and discharge of bone during the first year. Dur- ing the same year the femur broke in its lower third but united again with a shortening of 3 or 4 inches. Con- fined by attacks of inflammation during one-half of the time since disease began ; and for some years the knee-joint had been involved. Amputated Feb. 27th ; convalescence slow, but in Oct. he was seen by Dr. W. in fine health and spirits. In the lower back part of the femur is a large and per- fectly loose sequestrum, 5 inches in length, with a cloaca leading from the cavity that contains it, and opening upon the front of the femur. The cavity of the bone, where sawed, is obliterated. Appearances of former fracture nearly effaced. Knee-joint disorganized. Dr. W. remarked, in connection with this case, upon the very few cases of extensive necrosis of the femui that had been relieved by operation, so far as he had seen ; and als.oMORBID ANATOMY. 237 upon the very abundant hemorrhage from the smaller ves- sels where there had been much previous inflammation in the amputated limb. 1865. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1290. Necrosis of the femur, with disease of the knee-joint. From a man set. thirty-five, who entered the hospital Sept. 9th, 1869 (141, 197). Eighteen years previously he broke the lower third of the femur, and for a year small pieces of bone were occasionally discharged. A stiff knee was the result. Eleven months before entrance he fell through a barrel, struck the knee, and sharp pain followed. Three months afterwards an opening formed upon the in- side of the knee, and subsequently behind the joint, with free discharge. On the 15th Dr. G. amputated the limb, and there was much hemorrhage, with great exhaustion for a day or two. On the 27th there was a sudden and copious hemorrhage that made it necessary to open the wound and tie the bleeding vessel. After this the man did well, and on the 25th of October he left the hospital. The portion of femur removed is rather more than 4 inches in length, much enlarged, closely cancellated throughout upon the amputated surface, and without any appearance of central cavity. Surface irregular, and with spiculse. In the back part of the bone is a cavity, more than an inch in diameter, that opened largely into the knee-joint, and that is just seen upon the amputated sur- face ; not very rough within, and contains a sequestrum, 2£ in. in length that is smooth upon the outer surface, and in- volves a large portion of the circumference of the original O bone. The knee-joint contained pus, and the cartilage was to a great extent destroyed; the patella resting upon the outer condyle. 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 1291. Extensive necrosis of the tibia. A sequestrum, 9^ in. in length, rough upon the surface, quite thick and perfectly loose, lies along the front of the bone, and so perfectly ex- posed that it might be removed at once, if it were not for its connection with a second that lies deep in the substance of the bone, and toward its posterior face. The whole shaft of the bone is enlarged, misshapen, curved, and rough or granulated upon the surface anteriorly.

A cavity, that extends throughout its entire length, contains a sequestrum in. long, and to a large extent smooth upon the surface. The shell of bone that remains is thin for the most part, with very large deficiencies, light in structure, and everywhere irregularly nodulated and granulated upon the external sur- face. The upper and lower articular surfaces seem to have been healthy. From a young subject. The specimen belonged to Dr. P.’s father, and its history is unknown. 1869. Dr. C. B. Porter. 1293. A radius from which a large portion of the shaft would probably have in time been discharged as a sequestrum. Having been cut across at the time of the dissection, it is seen that the bone itself is not enlarged, though to some ex- tent rough upon the surface. It is surrounded, however, by a very thick and recent periosteal deposit. In this last, toward the carpus, is an opening into a cavity from which a portion of the old bone may have been discharged ; and toward the upper extremity are three smaller openings through which a sequestrum is seen. The extremities of the bone are healthy. See No. 1408. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigeloio. 1294. A femur, upon which an operation for necrosis had been performed. From a man thirty years of age (Hospital, 34, 167). Wrenched his knee twenty years before; fol- lowed by pain, suppuration, and discharge of bone for the first five years, but none since. Health not affected. Lower part of thigh considerably affected, with four open- ings about it. The outer part of the thigh was cut down upon, toward the front, and a large portion of bone was re- moved, but no sequestrum was found. The operation lasted more than an hour, and was followed by violent inflamma- tion and death in forty-eight hours.239 MORBID ANATOMY. The greater part of the shaft is enlarged. Posteriorly quite rough ; and toward the lower part is a small seques- trum, 2£ in. long, and situated in a broad, superficial, and rather smooth cavity. The excavation, the result of the operation, is in. long, £ in. wide, and generally about an inch deep. The bone is very heavy, and the central cavity filled up, as in cases of chronic inflammation; but a sinus is seen extending from it to the cavity that holds the sequestrum. 1856. Dr. H. J.

Dr. J. C. Warren.MORBID ANATOMY. 240 1299. Extensive necrosis of cancellated structure of the upper part of the tibia. From a man twenty-four years of a^e. (Hospital, 89, 208.) For the last fourteen years he had been subject every three or four years to attacks of pain, swelling, abscess, and discharge of bone. Ten days before admission one of these attacks came on, and the pain was intense, with delirium ; dead bone felt; discharge free and offensive. A piece of bone 2£ by f in. was removed, and he died five days afterward. The upper half of the tibia becomes, gradually, much en- larged near the head ; the surface is destroyed to a con- siderable depth, and exposes a large portion of the cancel- lated structure that is nearly separated as dead bone. This last and the surrounding bone is very light and delicate. The outer surface of the tibia is slightly rough and porous, but without any appearance of periosteal deposit. 1861. Dr. Geo. H.

He had been in the cavalry service, and his disease was attributed to the hard duty that be performed. During the last week of May, 1866, severe pain came on, followed by swelling; treated as phlegmonous erysipelas, by inci- cisions ; pus evacuated with relief, but the sinuses remained. Dead bone was felt on his admission into the hospital, July 8th (126, 138) ; and an opening near the elbow hav- ing been enlarged, the whole articulating extremity of the ulna was found loose and was removed. A long incision was then made, and the entire shaft of the bone, with the241 MORBID ANATOMY. lower articulating extremity, were drawn out without force ; the new bone being cut with the knife. The shaft is quite compact, and smooth externally ; but the extremities are in several delicate pieces, showing that the greater portion of them had been destroyed by caries. Aug. 26th, the wound had nearly healed, and there was an extensive development of new bone. Neither articulation showed any disposition to inflame, and the motions were already very good. Sept. 17th, the limb was doing as well as possible, and he was discharged. 1866. Dr, R. M. Hodges. 1303. The bones of a finger that was amputated for felon.

Case published in full by Dr. G. in the Med. Jour.

Dr. Johnson Gardner, of Providence, R. I. 1308. A sequestrum about 1£ in. in length, that was retained for several months after it was detached, and then coughed up. From a young man twenty years of age, who had had ulceration about the palate, with exposure of the bones, eighteen months before the report of the case by Di. B. The bone being at last suddenly detached, was supposed, by the attending physician, to have slipped into the larynx. This was followed by cough, which lasted until about six weeks before the report was made, when the bone was thrown off, enveloped in pus, and of a very offensive odor. Meanwhile the patient had not thought of the bone being in the air-passages, though he had a harassing and pecu- liarly loud and loose cough, with mucous rales over one lung, and at one time a severe attack of pneumonia upon the other side. After the discharge of the bone, the cough wholly left him ; and six weeks afterward, when the report was made, he was in perfect health. It was questioned whether the bone had lodged in the fauces, or had passed down the larynx. 1860. Dr. II. J. Bowditch. 1309. Thin exfoliations of bone from the forehead, following a rhinoplastic operation. The patient, a girl, set. twenty-two, had lost her nose from a scrofulous form of lupus. Dec. 15th, 1866, Dr. B. brought a piece of skin down from the forehead, and with it the periosteum, with the hope that this last might form a substitute for the nasal bones that had been destroyed by the disease. No such result, however, followed. On theMORBID ANATOMY. 243 2d of March the exfoliation took place, and on the 30th of April the forehead had healed. (Hospital, 129,126.) 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1310. A sequestrum that involved the whole anterior portion of the lower jaw. From a healthy man. Disease of two years’ duration, and attributed to mercurial salivation. Bone quite loose and removed at once. Jaw otherwise sound. 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1311. A second, that involved almost the entire front ol the lower jaw. From a healthy infant, about two years old. This patient, and the last, were both brought to the hospi- tal as out-patients on the same day. Duration of disease in this case for several months. Cause unknown. Bone loose, and removed at once. 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1312. The lower and upper maxillary bones, very extensively necrosed; from a man who had been engaged in making friction matches, and was thus exposed to the fumes of phosphorus, which at last caused the disease. When first seen by Dr. B., in March, his lower jaw was immensely swollen, and his tongue and gums highly inflamed. The following January he died of acute meningitis. Some of the bones of the nostrils, and the sella turcica were also necrosed. 1856. Dr. ID J. Bigelow. 1313. Sequestrum, from the side of the lower jaw, 2| in. in length, and about 1 in. in diameter. Infiltrated with a de- posit from the saliva, and consequently very compact and heavy. From a hospital patient, set. forty-nine (36, 228). Dis- ease of nearly one and a half years’ duration ; and came on as an acute inflammation, after exposure to cold ; side of face much swollen, and presented the appearances so often seen in necrosis. The sequestrum had been loose for two months, and was removed from the inside of the mouth. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1314. A sequestrum from the humerus, 6} in. long, and from the articular surface upward it comprises a very consider-MORBID ANATOMY. 244 able part of the bone, so far as it extends; the surface being partly smooth, though mostly rough. From a healthy boy, fifteen years of age. (Hospital, 41, 198.) One year previously the arm was badly broken, and he had compound dislocation of the elbow. The fracture did well; but four months after the accident two small pieces of dead bone came from the wound at the elbow, that had never healed, and afterward the lower extremity of the humerus began to push out. Fistulous openings formed along the shaft, and for the last two months the upper extremity of the sequestrum had protruded. The arm was found shortened, much enlarged, and very hard ; and the elbow immovably flexed. The lower end of the sequestrum had become black, and the bo}r had “ amused himself from time to time, by whittling off the end with his jackknife.” The bone having been removed, he was discharged in a few days; and, when heard from four or five years afterward, he had a good arm, and sufficient motion at the elbow. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1315. Necrosis of the clavicle. The separated portion is more than 2£ in. in length; and, to some extent, the whole thickness of the bone is involved. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1316. Sequestrum, If in. long, from the interior of the hume- rus, and involving to some extent more than one-half of the circumference of the bone ; also a smaller one, 1^ in. long, with some of the pieces of new bone that were remo\ ed with the sequestra. From a young man, nineteen years of age. (Hospital, 111, 119.) Two years previously he had had “ rheumatic fever; ” followed by an abscess about the middle of the arm, that opened some weeks afterward, and had contin- ued to discharge. Pain sometimes severe, though gener- ally slight. Bone removed at once, and the patient did well. 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1317. Portion of bone removed from the tibia, in case of ne- crosis. One, which must have been loose, is nearly 6 in. long, and includes the central cavity almost throughout, though with only a comparatively small part of the whole245 MORBID ANATOMY. thickness of the bone. Of four others, from 2£ to 3£ in. in length, two are partly dead, and two consist of new bone that had confined the sequestra. The marks of a trephine and catting instrument are seen. From a soldier, ast. twenty-one years. About a year previously a rifle-ball struck the leg at about the junction of the upper and middle thirds, and glanced down the bone. The wound remained open; and in the space of about 6 in. there were seven sinuses, with a foetid dis- charge. Did well after the operation. (Hospital, 111, 136.) 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1318. Sequestrum, about 2 in. long, and apparently from the femur. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1319. Sequestrum, 3f in. long, and slender; from the interior of some long. bone. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1320. Necrosis of the head of the first metatarsal bone; prog- ress of disease very rapid. From a healthy lad, seventeen 3rears of age, who inflamed his foot by wearing a pair of new brogans, fron the 6th to the 10th of November. Dec. 14th Dr. B. found swelling, and extensive suppuration, with several fistulae, and easily removed the dead bone. 1857. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 1321. A portion of the pelvis, showing a large and deep cavity along the articular portion of the pubes, and that contained a sequestrum. It is smooth, though very irregular upon the inner surface; and there is very little disease of the bone about it. — The surface, external^, was red, with fistulae ; and the disease appeared to be superficial. 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiv. 1322. A femur, that had been the seat of necrosis for about forty years. — From a man, fifty years of age. (Hospital, 69, 103.) Suppuration almost from the first, with occa- sional discharge of bone. Eight openings about lower part of thigh. Health feeble. Amputated, and did well. In the interior of the bone is a cavity, about 6 in. long, with large openings from it upon each side, but no dead bone ; several small pieces having been removed before the operation, and a large one before his entrance into the hospital. The bone shows the effects of chronic inflamma-MORBID ANATOMY. 246 tion, so far as the disease extends ; but above and below this it is quite healthy. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1323. Lower half of the femur, showing the effects of former inflammation and necrosis. From a man, set. twenty-seven years. (Hospital, 125, 106.) About twenty years before, he had typhoid fever, followed by “ fever sores ” about the lower part of the thigh, that kept open for about seven years, with occasional discharge of bone. He then got well, and remained so until 1861, when he went into the army, and after much exposure there came on disease of the knee-joint; for this last amputation was performed Feb. 10th, 1866, and on the 29th of March he died of pyemia. The shaft of the femur, which has been sawed longitudi- nal^, is moderately enlarged, rough and porous upon the surface ; and just above the condyles, anteriorly, shows a defined cavity in, and almost extending through, the sub- stance of the bone, large enough to admit the end of the forefinger, smooth and cicatrized for the most part upon the inner surface. The central cavity of the bone is mostly obliterated. 1866. Dr. R. M. Hoclges. 1324. Great disease of the femur ; the result of chronic inflam- mation and necrosis. The lower 5J in. of the bone is hol- lowed out into a large cavity, and surrounded incompletely by a thin shell of diseased bone. Amputation having been performed immediately above, the bone is seen to be mis- shapen, and the site of the central cavity is occupied by a solid, bony formation, for the closure of the cavity below; the structure of the bone around this solid portion being cancellous. Knee-joint flexed; anchylosis, partly bony. The tibia is healthy ; but, from a change in the articular sur- face, the bone is inclined outward. The patient was nineteen years of age ; and the disease, which was of eleven years’ duration, came on as an acute and very severe inflammation. In ten -weeks dead bone was felt, and the knee was very strongly flexed. A year afterward the bone was removed, the limb was straight- ened, and for three years small pieces of bone only came away. His general health was good after the first fewMORBID ANATOMY. 247 months; but, in the spring of 1866 it failed, and in Jan., 1867, when he entered the hospital (129, 144), it was very much impaired. The knee was anchylosed, and slightly flexed, with several openings, and a discharge of foetid pus. The limb was removed by Dr. B., and in three weeks he was discharged well. 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiu. 1325. Cast, showing the external appearances in the above case before amputation. 1868. 1326. A portion of fibula, 6 in. in length, light and earthy, with fusiform enlargement. A great part of the calibre has been destroyed, and there remains in its place a cavity from which a sequestrum had undoubtedly been discharged ; a small piece of dead bone being still adherent, though the inner surface is generally smooth. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1327. Lower half of the femur, of which the cavity is hollowed out, and the inner surface smoothed as if it must have con- tained a sequestrum ; with a large opening upon the ante- rior surface. The upper portion of the specimen is en- larged, very rough as from a new deposit, and terminates in a short and very irregular edge, but without any appear- ance of fracture. In structure it is extremely light. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1328. A portion of the shaft of a long bone, and probably the femur. Somewhat curved, much flattened, and altogether small and atrophied. The parietes are very thin, and leave a free cavity within, that terminates in a marked cul- de-sac, and is bounded in part by the internal, light, retic- ulated tissue of the bone. The cavity looks like one that had contained a sequestrum, though there is no appear- ance of inflammation of the bone. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1329. Almost the entire length of the femur, from below up- waid. The canal opens midway, and above this the bone gi adually becomes narrower, and at last tapers almost to a point; the edges being smooth. Very little enlargement, or roughness of the surface. Structure light; and the central canal is smooth, and hollowed out, as if it had con- tained a sequestrum. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.248 MORBID ANATOMY. 1330. Transverse section of a femur, removed by Dr. W., in an operation for necrosis. Bone very much enlarged ; struc- ture light, and in a cavity in its substance a small seques- trum is seen. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1331. A portion of the femur, apparently ; 6 in. in length, and about lj in. in diameter. Where it has been sawed across there is no trace of a cavity, but a uniform and rather light bony structure ; the very surface only being compact. No periosteal deposit. The other extremity terminates in two long and strong bony projections, or prongs they may be called ; with a considerable amount of caries upon the inner surface, though the longest one has for the most part a smooth and cicatrized appearance. Perhaps from a case of necrosis ; and not certainly human. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1332. The seven cervical vertebrae of an adult. Bodies and articulating processes extensively fused, with considerable deposit of new bone, and a strong inclination of the atlas toward the left side. Bones quite solid. 1863. Dr. 0. W. Holmes. 1333. Eight dorsal vertebrae; bodies anchylosed along the front, and toward the right side, by the growth of new bone from the edges of the bodies. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1334. Five dorsal, and two lumbar vertebrae; exostoses from the edges of the bodies, with partial anchylosis. From a laborer, about sixty years old. When eighteen years of age he fell down the hold of a vessel, and ever afterward had trouble in his back, with general rheumatism; dying at last of cardiac disease. 1866. Dr. J. S. Jones. 1335. Three lumbar vertebrae ; a thick mass of new bone unites two of the bodies upon the front, and toward one side. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1336. Specimen very similar to the last. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1337. Two lumbar vertebrae ; bodies anchylosed as in the above, but interesting on account of the extensive fusion of the articulating processes upon one side. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.249 MORBID ANATOMY. 1338. Two lumbar vertebras; articulating processes broadly expanded, thickened and rough. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. 1339. Two lumbar vertebrae ; partial anchylosis, etc., of bodies. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1340. Last dorsal, and three upper lumbar vertebrae. The bod- ies are diminished in thickness, and in the case of one of them very greatly so; with exostoses from the edges. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1341.

The sacrum is unusually straight. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1344. A scapula, that shows the effects of chronic arthritis ; and prepared by Mr. G. W. Pease. The acromion process is considerably lengthened by the addition of three pieces of new bone, that are as yet quite separate ; and upon the undei suiface of these, and of the process, is a very marked and ebuinated articular cavity. The coracoid process is enlarged ; and eburnated at the extremity ; and the glenoid cavity is enlarged, though scarcely eburnated. The aiticular surface of the head of the humerus (No. 257) is enlarged anteriorly and definitely, so as to involve the true neck of the bone, and the two tuberosities; and this was the only part, Mr. P. thinks, that came in contact with the articular surface of the scapula. From a male dissecting-room subject; the fingers seem- ing to be deformed as by rheumatism. 1863. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 1345. Bones of the elbow-joint, showing the effect of chronic aithiitis, a growth of new bone about the articular sur- face of the humerus, and almost a filling up of the olecra-250 MORBID ANATOMY. non fossa. The lower extremity of the other humerus is also shown, and is in very much the same condition. From the dissecting room. See next specimen. 1860. Dr. E. M. Hodges. 1346. A portion of newly formed bone, nearly or quite half an inch in diameter, and that was said, by the student who dissected the subject, to have been lying free in the cavity of the joint in the last case; though more probably it was in the capsule. The articular surface of the humerus, toward the outer condyle, is somewhat irregular, though not at all grooved, but there is no corresponding appear- ance upon the head of the radius. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1347. A second case. Bones of the elbow-joint, prepared in connection, by Dr. H., with their ligaments. A very con- siderable amount of new bone is thrown out about the artic- ular surfaces ; and there are also several pieces of new bone in the capsular ligament, the largest of which almost equals in bulk the tip of the little finger. The articular surface of the humerus looked well, excepting a somewhat grooved appearance. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1348. A third specimen. New bone about the articular surfaces, with eburnation of the outer portion of the humerus. Upon the articular surface of the head of the radius, anteriorly, is an appearance as if a considerable piece of the bone may have been broken away, and, though strongly united, may have caused subsequent inflammation. This surface of the radius, and the corresponding one of the humerus, are some- what eburnated. Bones otherwise healthy, as were the wrist and shoulder-joints. From an old subject. 1859. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1349. An entire pelvis, with anchylosis of each sacro-iliac syn- chondrosis. Otherwise quite well. 1847. Dr. J. C. Wapren. 1350. A second pelvis, rough upon the surface, and light in structure. The right ilium and sacrum are fused. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1351. Very remarkable change in the head and neck of the fe- mur ; none of the first remaining, and a small portion only251 MORBID ANATOMY. of the last. The articular surface is altogether below the trochanter, and inclined at an angle of about 45° with the shaft of the bone ; it is broad, somewhat convex, and some- what porous, but not rough ; edges everted, and irregular. The whole femur having been preserved in the present case, it is seen to be as solid and as healthy in structure, as in any adult. From Paris, and introduced here, though marked “ fausse articulation.” 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1352. Upper portion of the femur, showing the interstitial atro- phy, and the very great change of form in the head of the bone, that sometimes occurs in chronic arthritis. From the same patient as No. 1117. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1353. Os innominatum, and upper part of the femur, showing the effects of “ chronic rheumatic arthritis.” The head of the bone is much enlarged and misshapen, and moderately depressed. A large part of the smooth surface is worn away superficially, leaving it rough and porous. Corona much enlarged by the growth of new bone, and shelving over the neck. This last is not much if at all shortened, but shows the new deposit. Acetabulum not much if at all deeper than natural, though there is a considerable addition of new bone to the edge ; the bottom of the cavity being very much thickened, the pit at the bottom obliterated, and the edge continuous so as to form an opening in the place of the notch ; inner surface coarsely porous, and nowhere eburnated. Traces of new deposit upon os innom. in va- rious parts. 1860. Dr. R. M. Hodges. Photographs from the Albany College Museum. 1869. Dr. G. H. Lyman. 1354-5.

Eburnation of the condyles of the femur. “There was no apparent external deformity, nor any deficiency in the motions of the joint. Eburnation existed on the whole of the anterior portion of the articulating sur- face of the external condyle. The patella, also eburnated and worn thin by attrition, was displaced outward, so as to be disconnected with the internal condyle. The two sur- faces were marked with furrows in the direction of the movements of flexion and extension, accurately fitting together, and sliding upon each other like pieces of polished ivory. They were entirely free from cartilage, which else- where existed in a normal condition. The joint was sur- rounded with deposits of irregularly shaped new bone (stalactites ossenses), and a single point, pediculated, but253 MORBID ANATOMY. firmly attached, of the size and shape of a lentil, existed on the cartilaginous surface of the internal condyle.” 1856.

The two last phalanges of a horse, strongly anchylosed, with a branching and most exuberant growth of new bone over the surface. This and the two last specimens were presented in 1860. Messrs. Robert T. Edes and John Homans, Jr., med. students. 1370. All of the cervical, with the first dorsal vertebrae. This last is reduced by caries to a thin plate, anchylosed to the first rib and to the seventh cervical vertebra. Spinous processes of the first dorsal and last cervical widely sep- arated. The body of this last projects into the spinal canal, and is carious. Bodies generally in front quite rough, with growths of new bone from the edges. From a man who died from erysipelas. More than two years before, he had abscesses, resulting apparently in dis- location of the cervical vertebrae, and followed for a year by entire loss of power of motion in the limbs ; but this last was gradually restored. There was, also, perforation of the oesophagus, through which his drinks often escaped. 1849. Dr. F. S. Ainsworth. 1371. Skeleton of a young adult subject affected with Pott’s dis- ease.

From Paris; articulated, but not in proper position. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1372. A second adult skeleton, similarly affected. Body of the eighth dorsal almost entirely destroyed by caries ; and those of the four last curved somewhat forward and anchylosed. Articulating processes and laminae partially anchylosed. Bodies of the upper dorsal and two upper lumbar vertebrae somewhat carious. Bones generally quite healthy. From Paris, and formerly articulated like the last speci- men. Thorax and spine taken apart by Dr. N. B. Shurt- leff, and properly rearticulated. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1373. Ten dorsal and one lumbar vertebrae preserved in connec- tion and sawed lengthwise. The bodies of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth dorsal are more or less absorbed, and two of them almost entirely so ; the curvature amount- ing nearly to a right angle. Bodies fused, but not continu- ously. Laminae anchylosed, and also the heads of the ribs. Between the last dorsal and first lumbar there is more recent disease ; the intervertebral substance being entirely destroyed, and the adjoining bodies considerably necrosed, with caries about the dead bone. In the intervertebral substance, also, between the tenth and eleventh, and between the eleventh and twelfth verterbrae, was a small cavity that contained a little curdy matter, and was formed inde- pendently of the bone.

The lung adhered strongly to the carious vertebrae ; and, on tearing it away, there was an escape of pus. Some tubercles in one lung, and with pus in the kidneys. Speci- men prepared by Dr. E. 1859. Dr. C. Ellis. 1375. Destruction by caries of the whole body of the seventh dorsal vertebra, almost the whole of the eighth, and about one-third of the sixth. Curvature marked, but not great; there being quite a large open space in front, and anchy- losis between the spinous processes of the sixth and seventh vertebrae for the support of the column. The theca is ex- posed to a large extent, and the general appearance is that of an old and arrested disease. The bodies of the two upper lumbar vertebrae are also extensively carious ; more than one-half of the body of the second being destroyed, and the whole of the first, excepting the very upper portion. This last disease appears recent and progressive, as com- pared with the above; and the curvature is sufficient to have brought the diseased surfaces nearly into contact. Between these two portions of the spine the bodies are somewhat diseased superficially, and the intervertebral substance between two of the lower dorsal vertebrae is de- stroyed ; but otherwise the spine, the whole of which is pre- served and has been prepared by Dr. J., is healthy. The patient was a German woman, set. twenty-six years, and accustomed, as her countrywomen are, to carrying heavy weights upon her head. In Nov., 1847, having always be- foie this time had robust health, she was in a steam-car, that was thrown off the track and demolished, about a mile and a half from this city. Several persons were killed, and she was half buried by the ruins of the car that she was in. On her arrival in this city she was able to walk, with assistance, to a carriage, and from the carriage into a house. An hour or twro afterwards she was seen by Dr. J., who did not think her dangerously injured. On re- moving her corsets she complained of considerable dyspnoea, and of much pain about the middle of the dorsal vertebrae ; saying that she felt as if she had been “ twisted off.” There wras also tumefaction of the integument at the same part, with projection of the spinous processes, and in a few256 MORBID ANATOMY. days extensive ecchymosis. The pain and tenderness in the loins was more complained of afterward. In about three months she was able to move about the room with the aid of a chair; but in less than a week she was obliged to go to bed again on account of pain ; and subsequently a lumbar abscess formed. About this time she was found to be pregnant; and just nine months after the accident labor threatened, but she was not confined until three weeks afterward. The child was unhealthy, and lived eighteen months. The mother lived one year and nine days from the time of the accident, and from first to last there never was any loss of sensibility or muscular power, nor any affection of the sphincters, though there was a drawing up of the lower extremities with very great pain. The abscess discharged freely so long as she lived ; and, on dissection, was found to extend from one diseased portion of the spine to the other. Dr. J., who attended the patient throughout, and who has given the above history of the case, supposes that the spine was broken in two places at the time of the accident, and that caries supervened ; but there is certainly nothing now in the dorsal portion to show that it had ever been fractured. The lumbar portion looks more as if there may have been such an injury, but there is no appearance there of any attempt at reparation, though there is an anchylosis of the transverse processes upon one side. 1866.

There had been pain in the back for six months, and over the sacrum for three; Ins previous health having always been quite good. An abscess was opened; after which he became feverish and delirious, and died on the 8th of January. Much caseous matter, with large and extensive collections of pus, was found about the vertebrae; a miliary deposit roughout both lungs, tubercular meningitis, and the same disease in both testicles. 1868.

From a man, thirty-six years of age, who died of internal disease (Hospital, 210, 3) ; and “ for three years has had occasional pain in each shoulder, with some in the other joints.” The appearances are not at all those of “ chronic rheumatic arthritis.” 1857.

In the head of the ulna the most striking appearance is the great develop- ment of the ridge that is usually seen upon the art. sur- face ; and this ridge fits into a deep fissure between what may be called the inner and outer articular portions of the humerus. No appearance of recent disease, nor of old fracture, excepting a small piece of bone that is connected with the coronoid process by fibrous substance, and that is quite as probably a new formation. Bones quite compact, but slender from atrophy. From a middle-aged subject. The elbow was very much and almost permanently bent. 1857. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1399. Bones of the elbow-joint removed by excision ; 3 in. of the humerus, and 2 of the ulna, with the head of the radi- us. The articular surfaces are superficially carious; and externally to the joint the bones are rough from the ex- uberance of the new deposit. The patient was a healthy farmer, set. twenty-four years, and injured his elbow in February, 1855. In May acute inflammation came on, with suppuration. Excision Dec. 29th. In February, 1856, there were appearances of phthi- sis, and in May he was discharged; the elbow having beeu occasionally inflamed, and more or less troublesome” since the operation. (Hospital, 67, 71.) 1856. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1400. A second case. The patient was a man, twenty-nine years of age, and of scrofulous appearance. (Hospital, 77, 54.) In 1852 he struck his elbow violently, and from that time had more or less trouble. In July, 1857, fistulse began to form. In October, bone was felt, and in March, 1858, a portion of the olecranon was removed. His health failed, and in June the joint was excised. After this he impioved, and in September he was discharged. In the preparation the humerus is seen to have been re- moved just above the olecranon fossa, with the head of the ladius, and 2^ in. of the ulna ; this last showing the cavity262 MORBID ANATOMY. that resulted from the first operation. All of the articular surfaces .are carious, and externally the bones are rough from new deposit. Structure light. (See No. 1401.) 18o9. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1401. A portion of the humerus, and of the bones of the fore- arm ; from the last case. The patient returned to the hospital in about two months, with several fistulous openings, and a cavity in the former situation of the joint. Amputated Nov. 20th, and he was discharged well in Feb. The bones, prepared by Dr. Hodges, and shown in the adjoining figure, are con- nected by a fibro-cellular band, that, in the recent state, was 1 in. broad, and 1£ in. in length. The hume- rus, for 2 in. above where it was originally sawed, is enlarged, rough, and some- what carious. From the lower extremity, anteriorly, there project two defined conical processes of bone, curved forward and inward like horns, and arising, one from the inner, and one from the outer margin of the bone; their length being three-fourths of an inch, and their diameter about one- fourtli ; and there are also similar, but smaller, processes posteriorly. l’he ^ the forearm are less diseased tl.au the humerus, hut with Considerable growth of new bone bes des . senate piece that seemed to have been formed m the soft pa.ife This case has been published by Dr. . in • Vol txvvi. p. 345.

Dr. Hodges has remarked upon the reproduced condyles in this case, in his monograph on Excision of the Joints (p. 71), and he has copied for the Museum, a drawing of one of Mr. Syme’s cases (London Lancet, March 3d, 1855), in which a somewhat similar formation was observed. Dr. B. states, in his published account of the above case, that the patient died of phthisis about a year after the amputation ; there having been indications of the disease before the operation, and the disease of the arm not having- been arrested by it. 1859.

Feeble through the summer, but previously healthy. Disease of left ankle, wrist, and elbow, of eleven weeks’ duration ; result of a sprain ; inflamma- tion quite acute at first, with active constitutional symp- toms, and in two weeks suppuration about all the joints. Ankle quite painful; and bone was felt. Elbow much en- larged, and permanently flexed. Toward the last of the month the first record appears of the hip, and of which, with the knee, he then chiefly complained ; abscess opened at elbow. Gradually sank, with great suffering, and died on the 30th of July. On dissection, the head of the femur was found partially anchylosed to the acetabulum; the cervix broken, but probably after death, as the bone crumbled on the slightest handling, and the cavity of the joint was filled with the reddish, softened debris of the broken-down bone. ISo tubercular disease in any part of the bodjr. After macera- tion there was found some caries of the acetabulum, and a very finely marked periosteal deposit to a consideiable ex- tent along the inside of the femur, and upon both suifaces of the ilium.

Pain for the last two years, and first felt in the knee, with discharge of pus about the hip during the last year. As the local symp- toms were urgent, and his strength was failing, the opera- t'on was performed on the 30th. Abscesses, however continued to form ; but, toward the last of October, he was able to sit up, and to be carried out of doors ; and on the 14th of November he left the hospital with his health much improved. The head of the bone is in a great measure destroyed by caries, and irregular, but scarcely rough upon the surface. he neck is also absorbed superficially, upon the anterior surface, to some extent, and very definitely ; and there is some new bony deposit about it. Otherwise the bone is compact and healthy. The acetabulum, however, was much c lseased, and portions of bone were removed at the time of the operation. 1869. Dr, Bm M Hodg^ 1412. A second case. - The patient was fifty years of age, and entered the hospital Aug. 6th, 1869 (127, 98). Two years previously he injured his hip, was laid up for two months, and had complained of it from that time. In March, of n„! gaV7T, WOrk; 111 June there was a discharge of pus, and the pain had been very great. He was veiy anmmie; and the limb was quite cedematous, with three off ^^ ab°Ut the hip ; dis^rge free from day 0f entra ^ deUUded bone was felt. On the of the dis n 311 lnC1Slonwas made> and a large portion of the diSeaSed bone was removed ; but it was found to be bone and 0Cyt!nfiltrated ^ pus’ and the head of the decided upcn° 7°^ S° diSeaSed tbat excisioa was the natien 1 \ r°l ab°Ut tW° Weeks after the operation the patient had very much less pain ; but he then began to fall off and on the 7th of Sept, he died.

The whole of the trochanter, a portion of the neck, and a large portion of the shaft are gone, and were probably removed at the time of the operation. Head of the bone of full size, but quite rough and denuded. Whole surface rough, as from inflammation, but without much new deposit, and without thickening of the parietes . of the shaft. The interior of the bone looks as if there may have been a suppurating cavity there, and upon the anterior surface the remains of a cloaca are seen. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 1413. Disease of the os innominatum and femur; from a fe- male, dissecting-room subject, 60-65 years of age. “Previous to dissection, the subject exhibited the fol- lowing appearances:—There were adduction and flexion of the thigh, inversion of the foot, prominence of the tro- chanter, scars of old sinuses about the gluteal region, and four or five inches shortening. Motion, excepting rotation, tolerably free. “ Os innominatum very thin and light, diaphanous to a remarkable extent; clorsum ilii convex instead of concave. - The cotyloid cavity has lost its regular rounded shape ; its smooth, circular lip is in a measure absorbed ; its place, together with the cavity itself, is marked by bony excres- cences that have partly obstructed the latter; and an ex- tremely dense, fibrous tissue in the recent state completed this obliteration. Superiorly, and somewhat posteriorly to the acetabulum is a smooth, articulating surface, half an inch in width b}r an inch and five-eighths in length, which, when the specimen was fresh, was covered by a smooth cartilage. “ The femur is also atrophied. The head of the bone has disappeared, and but about seven-eighths of an inch of the neck remains, irregularly rounded at its extremity ; covered, where recent, on the prominent points with smooth carti- lage. The lesser trochanter exists merely as a small spicu- lated process, and the space between it and the neck of the bone is transformed from its normal character to a smooth surface in the recent state, coated with cartilage, from which, here and there, fibrinous bands were thrown ofT. This surface articulated with that described as existingMORBID ANATOMY. 267 about the acetabulum, whilst the lesser trochanter was con- nected by long fibrinous bands with the dense tissue filling the cotyloid cavit}'-. The smooth surface terminating the neck of the bone, extended 14 in. beyond the border of the acetabulum ; but no new cavity or articulating surface exists where it rested on the dorsum ilii. “The specimen is interesting in connection with Dr. March’s statement, that spontaneous dislocation of the hip seldom or ever takes place.” 1856. Dr. B. M. Hodges. 1414. The upper third of the femur, of which the articular por- tion is most remarkably affected; from Paris. There are the remains of a neck for the most part; but it almost at once enlarges or flares out, and terminates, as it were, in an irregularly and somewhat convex surface, about 2f in. in diameter. This surface, which veiy much overlaps the neck, has to a considerable extent a somewhat smooth and cicatrized appearance ; but in it are many little holes that look like the result of caries ; and in a cavity just beneath the surface, and nearly as large as the tip of the little Auger, there was found, when the specimen was soaked in watei, preparatory to being sawed, a curdy, opaque sub- stance. Otherwise the bone is quite compact and healthy in structure. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1415. A portion of the os innominatum and femur of an adult, showing a very remarkable destruction of the bones from old disease. The acetabulum is deep and much enlarged ; inner surface quite irregular; two large, and, for the most part, smooth openings through the bone, with a piece of dead bone still attached in one of them, and a third open- ing that is still closed by dead bone. The head and neck of the femur are entirely destroyed, with a deep cavity in the substance of the bone ; surface rough from new deposit. Structure of both bones very light, as from interstitial atrophy. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1416. Section of the hip-joint of a child, showing complete dis- organization from chronic disease.

The deformity was so great that the body was hung up, and a back view taken of the whole subject for Dr. B.’s collection of Surgi- cal Illustrations. A slight depression only remains in the place of the acetabulum, and the bone here has a singularly reticulated appearance. There is also an opening through the bone, at this part, about half an inch in diameter. Just above and behind the acetabulum the femur was anchylosed to the ilium b}r a very narrow neck, but, having been acci- dentally broken off, it has been lost. The ilium is for the most part very light, though very thick, and upon the inner surface numerous little pits are seen, but not, apparently, the result of caries. The head of the femur was destroyed ; and the lower end of the bone was exceedingly thin, and filled with a clear yellow oil. 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigeloio. 1418. Pelvis, with the upper half of both femora; from a case of former disease and dislocation of both hip-joints; pre- pared by Dr. C. From a middle-aged woman. There was shortening of both extremities, and great prominence of the trochanters, but no suppuration. The appearances of the bones upon both sides are about the same ; neck reduced in length about one half, standing off from the shaft at a right angle, and ending in an irregularty rounded surface rather than a proper head. The acetabulum is quite shallow and irregular; and there is an irregularity upon the outer surface of the ilium just above it, but with no marked ap- pearance as of an attempt at a false joint. 1863.

Sequel of hip disease four years previously. The femur was flexed and adducted ; the knee contracted, and the foot several inches from the ground and everted. On the 1st of June, 1869, the sar- torius, tensor vaginse femoris, and adductor longus were divided, and the adhesions within the joint ruptured by “ brisement force;” and about the last of Sept, the boy went home with a wonderfully improved limb. The.femur was perfectly straight, and on a line with the body; the symmetry of the two sides being nearly if not precisely alike ; and with a fair motion of the hip-joint; knee straight. The whole limb one inch shorter than the other, but the shortening was chiefly between the knee and ankle, and is fully accounted for by arrest of growth. 1869. Dr. Buckminster Brown. 1421. Bony anchylosis of right hip-joint. From a young man, mt. twenty, who died of leucocy- themia at the hospital (273, 96). About five years before, he was kicked upon the hip by a horse, and had been lame from that time. The thigh was strongly inverted, and car- ried toward the left side, and the hip was quite prominent. Shortly before his death he had severe pain in the hip, and an abscess afterward opened there ; abscesses being found, on dissection, upon each side of the lumbar vertebrae, and pus beneath the psoas muscles, as far as the groins. The head of the bone is about of full size, but drawn somewhat upward and strongly anchylosed. Besides the general displacement there is a strong inward twist of the lower end of the bone. 1868. Dr. J. Romans. 1422. A fracture of the left femur just below the great trochan- tei. Union strong, but very irregular, and not complete. The bone is flexed upon the pelvis nearly at a right angle, and inverted ; and there is bony anchylosis of the hip-joint. From a man who died at the hospital (280, 114), of in- ternal disease. The thigh was 4 in. shorter than its mate. I he bones overlap to that extent or more ; and, a very con- siderable absorption having taken place of each of the fragments, it appears as if it majr have been originally a very oblique fracture. 1869.

Disease of the knee-joint. — From a man thirty-four years of age. (Hospital, 114, 86.) Sprained his knee twenty- eight years before, and it was not until two years after- ward that he could get about with a crutch. In four years abscesses formed ; but these healed, and he was able to walk six miles to his work. In Dec., 1863, there was severe pain, and in March an abscess formed that continued to discharge. In August the pain was still very severe, and the limb was amputated. In Sept, two profuse hemor- rhages occurred, and the femoral artery was tied. Oct. 26th he died of hospital gangrene. On dissection, metastatic abscesses were found in the lungs, with very severe inflammation of the throat, phle- bitis, and a large abscess in the thigh. The knee-joint, when removed, showed fleshy anchylosis, with permanent flexion ; the patella being connected with the inferior surface of the outer condyle ol the icmiu. The bones having been macerated, there is seen to be a great enlargement of the inner condyle of the femui, with ii- regularity and acute caries of the inner articulai suiface, and of the corresponding portion of the head of the tibia. Upon the very back part of the outer condyle is a smooth surface, and a corresponding one upon the outer head of the tibia, showing where the two were connected; this last being to a considerable extent absorbed. 1864. Dr. li. M. Hodges. 1427. Lower portion of the femur, from a case of amputation at the knee-joint. From a man, ret, thirty years, who for several years had been subject'to hemorrhages, but was otherwise healthy.271 MORBID ANATOMY. Having had a large, obstinate, bleeding ulcer over the shin, the leg was amputated below the knee ; but the hemorrhage from the tibia was so profuse that disarticulation at the knee-joint was immediately performed. The wound never healed ; and a jrnar afterward, on his admission into the hospital (126, 256), there was a large hemorrhagic ulcera- tion. Amputation was performed at once at the lower part of the thigh, with no more loss of blood than usual; but the next morning there were ecchymoses about the upper part of the thigh, with prostration, and the patient died about twenty-four hours after the operation. On examination of the end of the bone, the cartilage was found to a considerable extent smooth and unabsorbed, though united to the soft parts by slight adhesions. This may be inferred from the prepared specimen, though it has unfortunately been dried. Med. Jour. Vol. lxxv. p. 384. 1867- Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1428.

In Jan., 1857, he was in the hospital with fracture of the right patella, and in Nov., 1858, he re-entered with a fracture of the left; (No. 1129), the separation of the fragments of the right, at this last date, amounting to 3£ in. In August, 1859, he again entered (85, 128) ; the right knee having become swollen and painful, with suppuration four weeks before. Excision on the 7th of Sept. The condyles were suffi- ciently healthy, though there were old adhesions with the patella ; one-half of the articular surface of the tibia, how- e\ei, was much diseased. The patient was much reduced b} the opeiation, but on the 6th of Dec. the anchylosis was tolerably firm, and on the 2d of Jan. he was discharged well. (See next specimen.) 1860. Dr. II. J.

Dec. 13th, 1861, the man again entered the hospital (96, 138), with a fracture of the left thigh, and died on the 16th. A long, section having been made, there is seen to be a con- tinuous and healthy cancellated structure between the bones ; anteriorly, the surfaces are continuous, though with slight flexion, but posteriorly the head of the tibia projects about three-fourths of an inch backward. The half of the patella that remained after the excision has been attached to the board, upon which the other is displayed, and is the smallest and least compact of the two. 1862. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1431. A second specimen of excision of the knee-joint. The condyles are shown, to the outer of which the patella is an- cltylosed, and upon the cancellated surface of which a de- fined cavity is seen ; this last, which was cut through in the operation, is about 1 in. in diameter, and the surround- ing bone appears healthy. One large and two small slices from the tibia are also shown, the articular surfaces of which are irregular, but scarcely carious. The patient was a woman, mt. twenty-four 3'ears. (Hos- pital, 123, 126.) When four years old she struck her knee, and was laid up for a year ; but afterward used the limb freely till the age of eighteen, though with occasional pain and swelling. She then became worse and used crutches for three jmars, with formation of abscesses. The limb was nearly straight, but with the condyles upon the anterior edge of the head of the tibia. Motion very slight. No pain ; and no discharge for the last year. Operation Nov. 10th; silver wire passed through the bones and twisted; and a straight splint applied. Profuse discharge followed, with fever and chills, and the patent died on the eighteenth day. 1866. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1432. A third specimen. Condyles of the femur removed.

A fifth specimen. Excision of about 2 in. of the lower end of the femur. The patient (Hospital, 115, 62) was fifteen years of age, and sprained his knee when he was three years old. Four years afterward he had acute inflammation of the joint, and from that time had been unable to walk upon the limb. The knee was fixed at an angle of 110°, painful and sensi- tive on pressure, considerably enlarged and distorted, and with an open sinus upon the inside of the leg. The general health being good, excision was performed May 21st, 1864. A transverse incision was made, and carried well down upon the sides for the escape of the pus that might subse- quently form. The bone was then removed with the patella, which was consolidated with it, and also a small portion from the tibia; the caries being rather deep, though limited. Considerable force was required to break down the false anchylosis that existed. Hamstring muscles di- vided. Diseased synovial membrane cut away with the scissors. The rigidity of the nerve and vessels in the. popliteal space rendered the straightening of the limb con- siderably difficult, even after the removal of the bone. Dur- ing the first forty-eight hours there was a strong tendency to displacement, which was overcome by straps and firm compression ; but four weeks after the operation, there was some stiffening of the bones, suppuration had diminished and after a very long convalescence, he was discharged well, June 14th. 1865. Dr. R. M. Hodges.MORBID ANATOMY. 274 1435. A sixth specimen. Condyles of the femur excised, with the patella, to which they are firmly anchylosed. The patient, set. twelve years, entered the hospital Feb. 19th, 18G8 (134, 188). Five years before, he received a cut near the knee with a hatchet. Considerable inflamma- tion followed, and a year afterward the joint was stiff at an angle of 45°. On admission, the knee was not enlarged nor painful, but firmly anchylosed. On the 22d, the operation was performed; the head of the tibia not being interfered with. One large and one small thin slice of bone were, however, removed from the femur, in order to bring the bones into good apposition. Holes were drilled in these last, which were sufficiently healthy, and silver-plated wires were passed through and twisted. On the 26th of April the wires were removed. On the 12th of May there was firm union, and on the 12th of June he left the hospital. IS68. Dr. H J. Bigelow. 1436. A seventh specimen. The tibia and the posterior portion of the condyles of the femur are extensively, and for the most part deeply carious ; and there is caries of the under surface of the patella. From a man, ®t. twentj'-six years. Disease of two and a half years’ duration. Knee bent at an angle of 40°, and immovable, as well as the patella. Head of the tibia drawn back under the condyles of the femur. Very little enlarge- ment, and no external opening, but considerable pain. General health good. The operation was done Sept. 30th, 1868 ; suppuration followed, and the thigh was amputated Feb. 12th, after which the man did quite well. (Hospital, 135,258.) 1869. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1437. Portions of the femur and tibia, from the above case after amputation. The opposing surfaces of the bones are denuded and carious, and in some parts there is a consider- able loss of substance. 1869.

The leg was dislocated backward, arid permanently flexed so that the toe just touched the ground when she was erect. Oct. 11th, the femur was sawn through above the condyles,MORBID ANATOMY. 275 and a portion of the tibia, three-fourths of an inch in thickness, was removed, besides a second thinner piece; and, on the following day, as the bones were not in proper position, the wound was opened and two silver wires were passed through them. Some suppuration, with discharges of small pieces of bone, continued so long as she remained in the hospital, but she was otherwise doing quite well when she left on the 9 th of Dec. In the preparation the fagettes by which the bones are connected are small, but quite marked, and situated far back, in accordance with the position of the limb before the operation. The original articular surfaces are otherwise effaced. 1865. Dr. 11. M. Hodges. 1439. Bony anchylosis of the knee-joint. — From a man, set. fifty-nine years. (Hospital, 54,135.) At the age of twenty- four years he cut into the knee-joint with a broad axe, and nearly lost his limb. Two or three years afterward an ulcer formed upon the leg, continued from that time, and at last required amputation. Died with albuminuria, etc., about two months after the operation. . The bones of the leg, and particularly the fibula, are affected as usual in cases of old ulcer; enlarged, mis- shapen, solid, and rough upon the surface from spines and bony growths of various forms. 1852. Dr. 8. D. Townsend. 1440. The same between the patella and femur; with old dis- ease of the articular surface. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1441. Knee-joint flexed to an acute angle, showing an extensive and bony anchylosis between the patella and the under surface of the condyles of the femur, and also between the inner condyle and the tibia. Between the tibia and outer condyle the union is close, but probably not bony. The outer condyle is mostly absorbed, and there is a consider- able growth of new bone from the upper and outer portions of the patella. On section several large shot are seen, moie or less battered, in the substance of the bone, and some project into the cavity of the joint; others, that were removed when the specimen was prepared, being shown in a phial. The structure of the bone is sound.MORBID ANATOMY. 276 The patient, £et. nineteen, entered the hospital (125, 32) Nov. 8th, 1865. Four years before he was shot in the knee, and for the next year kept his bed, with much swell- ing and profuse suppuration. No motion in joint for three years, though there was but little pain. The knee was bent to an acute angle ; the leg was much atrophied, and the bone could be felt through an old sinus. Amputation on the 11th. On the 21st the bone protruded ; much pain followed; and on the 29th of Dec., 5 in. of the femur were removed. To the extent of about 4 in. it was sur- rounded by new bone from ^ to § in. in thickness ; and on section, in the recent state, it showed finely the appear- ances of osteo-myelitis.

Upper half of the astragalus, from a woman about forty- five years of age, “ and of a decidedly scrofulous diathesis.” In June, 1865, she complained of having sprained her ankle ; and, when first examined, some weeks afterward, there was considerable swelling, with tenderness, and pain on motion; the pain being generally slight. In Dec.277 MORBID ANATOMY. several openings formed, and the patient died, worn out by the disease, on the 1st of March ; there seeming to be no time when, from the state of the system, amputation could have been performed. In the recent state a large portion of the articular sur- face was not merely entirely denuded of cartilage, but as polished as glass, and this appearance is still quite well shown; the remainder being superficially ulcerated, and covered by a thin opaque deposit. The polished portion seemed to consist of a very thin and delicate lamina of bone that might have been broken through with the thumb- nail, and without any of the solidity beneath that exists in a case of eburnation ; the bone being very light. The whole corresponding surface of the tibia resembled the ulcerated portion. 1849. Dr. George Faulkner, of Jamaica Plain. 1445.

Cast of a foot, from which the tarsal bones had been ex- tensively removed. A man, thirty-one years old, seven weeks previous to his admission to the hospital (118, 216), wounded the dorsum of his left foot deeply with an axe. Abscesses, extensive suppurative inflammation of the soft parts, and disease of the tarsal bones followed. His general health depreciated in consequence. July 22d it was found that the finger could be passed through the tarsus to the sole of the foot. By a transverse incision across the instep, the proximalMORBID AXATOMY. 278 beads of all the metatarsal bones, the three cuneiform bones, and the cuboid, all of which were diseased, were removed. A large incision was made longitudinally through the thickness of the sole, to permit the escape of pus. In making the dorsal incision, the extensor tendons were disregarded, as their usefulness had already been destined by the primary injury and the subsequent inflam- mation. Aug. 17th the patient sat up. Aug. 27th he began to walk by the aid of crutches. Sept. 1st the wound was entirely healed. “Sept. 11. — Having been about the hospital grounds for ten days, the cicatrix being perfectly sound and firm, and his health entirely re-established, the patient was discharged. The foot was somewhat shortened, though otherwise but little deformed.' Its plantar aspect was convex instead of concave ; the bulging being due to the flexion caused by ap- proximating the surfaces of the gap made in the skeleton of the foot. The pressure of further use promised to remedy this. For walking, the stump was preferable to aity which could have been left by an amputation of a portion of the foot, the only alternative of the operation performed.” 1865. Dr. B. M. Hodges. 1448. Cast of a foot, from which all of the tarsal bones had been excised, with the ends of the tibia and fibula. The patient, a little boy five and a half years old, was run over July 14th, 1865, and three hours afterwards entered the hospital (120, 74). The right foot was very extensively lacerated, but without fracture or dislocation ; and the left was similarly, but less, injured. On the 15th numerous punctures and incisions were made, to relieve the tension, which was very great, and with much relief. On the 18th there was a mild attack of scarlet fever, but with prolonged convalescence; and, meanwhile, all active inflammation of the feet subsided, and the left got quite well. Over each malleolus of the right there was broad ulceration, and dead bone could be felt. Sept. 6th, the general health being sufficient^ improved, the foot was examined, and it was found that there was general necrosis of the tarsal bones, and that the ends of the tibia and fibula were also involved. About 1 in. of279 MORBID ANATOMY. these last were therefore removed, and all of the first; an effort being made to leave behind all the periosteum possi- ble. Oct. 6th the wound had healed, the foot had regained its shape, and differed only from its fellow in length and the want of prominence at the heel. The patient could raise and hold it out himself, and wore only a small tin splint, with a foot-piece for support. Oct. 13th he began to walk; and, though the foot was considerably shortened, it furnished a remarkably firm and hard-padded stump, promising advantages over an artificial substitute. Gen- eral health and flesh entirely restored. At the end of six months these patients were both doing quite well; the man doing full work as a ship-carpenter, and the boy playing about as freely as any one, though limp- ing somewhat. 1865. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1449-50. Great deformity from an old injury. Casts of the foot, before and after operation. The patient, a boy, set. nine years, entered the hospital June 11th, 1867 (132, 96). When two years old he wounded the foot; abscesses followed, and in about five months bone was removed. For nine months the wound did not heal, and the foot did not grow. Ankle had always required support; and for the last two years the foot had been turning out, so that, on entrance, the boy walked upon the inside of the foot and end of the tibia. Foot much smaller than its mate. On the 12th about 1^ in. of the tibia were removed, and about £ in. of the fibula. No liga- tures required. Splints were applied, and subsequently a dextrine bandage. Occasional discharge of small pieces of bone; but on the 30th of Sept, the boy was discharged well. Nov. 30th, he reported at the hospital. Could walk quite fast and without support, but with a slight limp. Ankle quite healed, and much smaller than when discharged. 1867. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1451. Bones removed from the above case. 1868.

Disease of one year’s duration, and cause unknown. Gradually increasing swell- ing, but without much inconvenience until the last three months, when an opening formed, and he gave up his work. On admission, the ankle was about twice its natural size, and denuded bone was felt. On the 28th the joint was cut down upon ; and, after forcible dislocation, the bones were removed ; the tendons being preserved, and two ligatures only being required. Oct. 16th the parts were not doing well, and the leg was amputated. Still further the stump did not do well, and on the 15th of Feb. li in. of the bone were removed. March 24th he left the hospital. Oct. 26th he was readmitted; Dec. 12th bone was again removed, and on the 23d of Feb. he was discharged well. 1867. Dr. R. M. Iloclges. 1453.

Photograph of a case of ivory exostosis of the frontal region. The patient, a healthy farmer, ret. twenty-four, entered the hospital under the care of Dr. IE, Oct. 18th, 1864 (114 244). Three years previously, he fell upon the ice, struck Ins forehead, and just afterward a tumor appeared, that, on admission, extended from the left temple to just beyond the median line, and from the roots of the hair downward into the orbit. The eye protruded, and was dis- p aced downward and outward. The tumor was 5 in. by “ dloaraeter’ and protruded 2£ in. Integument not affected. Surface uniformly smooth, but with an imper- fectly marked division into a frontal and an orbital por- lon. e t bony and immovable, except at one or two points where there was an elasticity, as from a thin, bony cyst. Not sensitive, though at times very painful. VisionMORBID ANATOMY. 282 impaired ; and attempts to raise the lid caused severe pain in the e3^eball. Never any cerebral s)rmptoms. The man stated that the tumor had a bony feel from the first, but that, at the end of a year, a fluctuating spot appeared toward its inner border, was punctured, and dis- charged a sanious, watery, purulent fluid ; the tumor be- ing then, and subsequently, exceedingly painful. Some months afterward it was punctured again, in the same spot, and with a similar result. At that time, July, 1863, he had typhoid fever; and the tumor afterward increased with great rapidity. Oct. 19th an operation was performed, when a thin shell of bone, deficient at various points, was found expanded over the tumor ; and, between the two, a quantity of degen- erated pus. Two slices of the tumor were removed by an amputating saw; and then, with the mallet and chisel, the remaining portion was cut down to a level with the fiontal bone, and gouged out from the orbit, so that the eye could be restored to its natural position. Of four chisels that were used, the edge of but one could act upon the dense ivory structure. There was not the slightest sign of vas- cularity in any part of the tumor. After the operation he did perfectly well till the 11th of November; eating steak, etc., with great relish. Then oedema of the forehead came on, followed by severe head- ache ; but on the 16th he was doing well again. On the 20th he was less well, and had severe pain; on the 21st, delirium ; on the 23d, coma ; and on the 24th he died. On dissection, the tumor was found to project internally, as it did externally, and to compress the left anterior lobe of the brain, the whole of which last had been converted into an abscess. The right hemisphere, where, in contact with the left, was sloughing and purulent for the space of a square inch, but the meningeal inflammation was slight. In structure, the internal, like the external portion of the tumor was uniformly dense throughout, and nowhere cancellated; but, from its color and general appearance, it would seem to have undergone necrosis, though, being so devoid of vessels, this could not easily be determined. It283 MORBID ANATOMT. was loose in the framework of the frontal bone ; whereas, when operated upon, it was perfectly fixed. There was also a bony shell about the internal portion, as about the external, but without the intervening puriform substance ; and the tumor itself was invested with something like a membrane, that was easily wiped off, and that was not ob- served upon the external portion. The nasal cavities were invaded; and the whole posterior part of the orbit was filled with a series of small lobules connected with the main tumor.; but there were no isolated formations. The growth had nowhere separated nor distorted the bones; but seemed to have its origin in the frontal sinus, or the diploe of the frontal bone ; the bony shell about it being probably the expanded inner and outer tables of the bone. In a published report of this case (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxi. p. 415), Dr. H. refers to a similar operation having once been done successfully ; and also to the treatment by caus- tics, by means of which the tumor dies, and is cast off. 1864- Dr. R.

In the cancellated structure of one section, that has been preserved in spirit, are seen three or four soft, whitish, crumbling, rounded, tubercular- looking deposits, of the size of small peas ; and confut- ing the plastic deposit of tertiary syphilis, as described by Ricord in the bones, liver, and heart (Clinique Iconograph- ique cle VHop. des Venenens). The lungs, in this case, were perfectly free from tubercles ; and the other organs were healthy, excepting the liver, which was hard, granu- lated, of a dark yellowish or brownish red color, rather dry, and having a peculiar waxy, amyloid translucency. In two of the ribs, however, and in one of the clavicles, there was an opaque, curdy deposit, with caries, or some- thing like it. For the history of the case see No. 1292 P- 226‘ 1852‘ Dr. H. J.

The tumor, which was of several years’ duration, was painless, immovable, had an elastic hardness, and was regarded by Dr. B., before the removal, as enchondromatous, but afterward as a biusa, oi something very much like it. 1860. Dr. H. J. Bigeloio. 1485. Myeloid disease of the head of the tibia; and a section having been made through the tumor, and into the bone below, the soft parts have been removed, and the investing bone dried. From a man, twenty-six years of age. (Hospital, 87, 160.) Eighteen months previously he fell, and a tumor soon appeared over the inner part of the head of the bone ; pain never severe nor sharp. An opening had been made not long before, as for an abscess ; and at this part a cir- cular fungus had formed, about 2 in. in diameter. Ihe whole upper part of the leg, as far as the knee, was the seat of a very large, and strongly fluctuating tumor. Mo- tions of the joint not impaired. The thigh was amputated ; and the man did well for a time ; lie then got worse, startedMORBID ANATOMY. 287 for Montreal, and died in the cars. Dr. Ellis found the microscopic appearances of myeloid disease; but unfortu- nately no record was made of the gross appearances of the interior. The head and upper part of the bone are distended into a large, rounded cavity, the parietes of which are gener- ally thin, and in some parts destroyed. Inner surface rough and somewhat reticulated. The articular surface looks healthy, and the tibia below the tumor is perfectly so ; the limits being remarkably defined. In the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet is a perfectly similar speci- men (No. 1282), in which the gross appearances of the interior were highly characteristic of myeloid disease, but no microscopic examination was made. The ischium is the bone affected. See Mr. Gray’s paper on Myeloid Tumors of Bone, with figures of the microscopical appearances, in the Med. Chir. Trans. Vol. xxxix. p. 121. 1863. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. I486. A model in plaster, of the femur, from a case of gelatin- iforrn disease of the bone. I rom a man, twenty-two years of age. In April he had in- flammation about the left knee, and abscesses soon followed • gelatinous masses, of a reddish color, frequently escaping . with the pus. He sank from pain and suppuration ; and the limb was amputated in July. The stump did well, but he died with purpura, etc., in about seven weeks. The periosteum around the lower half of the femur was thickened and granulated with the gelatiniform substance; and, where the tissues were most diseased, the thickness amounted to an inch and a half. Just above the condyles, posteriorly, the femur was largely perforated, as seen in the model; and the substance of the bone was found to be died with the soft gelatiniform material. The knee-joint was healthy. 1858. Dr. Alfred Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 1487 Knee-joint; in spirit.

The knee-joint and the femur appear healthy, and the cartilage remains in a pretty entire state. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1488. Metacarpal bone of the index finger, and the adjoining phalanx ; in spirit. The first, sawed longitudinally, shows an enchondromatous deposit in the substance of the bone, just behind the anterior extremity, nearly half an inch in diameter, and rising somewhat above the surface. A sim- ilar but much smaller deposit projects above the dorsal surface of the phalanx, and close to its posterior articu- lating surface. These two bones are otherwise healthy, but upon one of the bones of the middle finger was a similar deposit. 1856. Dr. li. M. Hodges. 1489. A large epithelial, cancerous growth, from about the middle of the tibia. From a man, set. thirty-eight, who entered the hospital April 17th, 1838 (19, 19). About seventeen years previ- ously he had fever; and boiling water was poured upon his legs to produce vesication. Extensive ulceration fol- lowed, and continued till 1837, when the left leg healed. In 1836 the right leg assumed a fungous appearance. In Jan., 1838, the growth was removed, and the bone scraped ; but, on admission, it was larger than ever, very painful, occasionally bleeding, and exceedingly offensive. He had kept his bed for about two years, taken laudanum freely, and was greatly reduced in health. On the removal of the limb, below the knee, he lost a great deal of blood ; and two weeks afterward the femoral artery was tied for sec- ondary hemorrhage. July 14th he left, much improved. The limb having been very fully injected with size and Vermillion, the fungous growth assumed at once, and very nearly, the appearance that it had before the operation ; as of a mass of exuberant granulations, 6 in. in length, 3 or 4 in width, and rising abruptly 2 in. or more above the surrounding surface, which was quite healthy. A section having been made through the limb, the growth was found to consist of a coarse, fibro-cellular structure; the fibres radiating toward the surface, from an opening in the tibia.morbid anatomy. 289 and being mixed with a more opaque and softer material but without any marked encephaloid appearance.

Dr. Benj. Cushing, of Dorchester. 1493. Cancerous disease of the femur, with fracture of the bone ; commencing just above the condyles, and being most advanced about 5J in. above the joint. Periosteal deposit very abundant, and upon the surface very irregu- lar ; structure coarse. Fractured extremities irregular, and generally rough ; but at one part, and where the bone probably finally broke, the appearance is like that of a recent fracture. To a considerable extent the parietes of the bone are quite gone; and in their place is a small sequestrum. Internal cavity of the upper fragment filled with an amorphous earthy deposit to the extent of about an inch. From a man set. forty-three years, who entered the hospital Oct. 29th (141, 242). Had been in the U. S. Navy, and was quite healthy, until about fifteen months ago, when, in S. America, he had intermittent fever, and about the same time began to have a pain beneath the right patella, shooting down the leg. The pain he attributed to passing shot on board the vessel. Last July he arrived in New York, and whilst he was in the Brooklyn Hospital there was discovered a very considerable swelling below the lower ribs upon the left side ; and this he still has, though it is very much diminished. There had also been an occasional pain there since the first of his sickness, on taking cold. The thigh was broken when he entered the hospital; but he knew nothing of the accident, and said that he had walked up-stairs only a week before. There was free motion between the fragments ; and at the seat of disease the limb was 2£ in. larger than the other; there having been swelling for the last few weeks. There was, also, much pain there on motion, but there never had been any at any other time. Leg oedematous. Health much impaired; and he had done no work since the first of his sickness. Nov. 6th the thigh was amputated about 104- in. above the joint; and the wound is now (Dec. 7th) doing well. In the recent state there was a whitish and not very soft,291 morbid anatomy. but malignant-looking growth at the seat of disease ; and to a considerable extent the periosteum could be traced' ovei it. In bulk it was larger than the fist. 1869. ■ A second specimen, prepared by Dr. Thomas DwHit i., and that contrasts remarkably with the last; the two cases having occurred at about the same time.

In the recent state a large, soft, cancerous growth was found situated over the diseased portion of the bone, with bony particles scattered through it, and walled in by the periosteal deposit. (Died March 29th.) 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 1495. A cast, in plaster, of a large part of the lower extrem- ity, in a case of cancer of the upper part of the tibia. The patient, a young man, nineteen years of age, had pain, with some swelling, at the junction of the middle and upper third of the tibia, in March, 1849. This sub- sided in a few weeks, and in six months he had another attack. In January, 1850, a third attack ; and from this time the swelling went on increasing; pain dull and heavy, and at last lancinating. His general health wras good, until 1850, and he worked upon a farm. In 1852-3 his health failed; and in September, 1853, the thigh was amputated. The tumor was then 25 in. in circumference, irregularly hard and soft, and in some parts boggy to the feel; enlargement regular and fusiform. The patient was then exceedingly emaciated, and rapidly sinking. On dissection of the tumor, it consisted of “ bone, flesh, pus, and blood.” Bone spongy, and lamellated throughout, and without any trace of its natural shape or structure. Fibula either involved, or partly absorbed by the pressure of the tumor. The patient’s father had his foot amputated, at the age of twenty-nine years, for disease of the bones of the foot, and the appearances were “ precisely like ” those in the present case. The grandfather also died, of cancer ot the bones of the face, at the age of fifty-six years. 1858. Dr. A. Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 1496. Section of one of the ribs, showing a defined, rounded, encephaloid mass, about 2 in. in diameter, arising from the bone, and projecting upon the inner surface.

The knee-joint is for the most part quite healthy, as is the femur where it was sawed across, and also the head of the tibia. Specimen in spirit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1499. Long, section of the ulna, about which are formed two tumors, that are undoubtedly cancerous, though they did not present the characteristic appearances microscopically. One, just below the middle of the bone, was, in the recent state, 3 in. in length, and 2 in. in diameter ; marbled, pearly white, with vascular points, some xanthoid, and one small bony deposit; not soft; surface of bone somewhat absorbed, though there was no morbid deposit in the inte- lior. The second was about the lower extremity of the bone, and not far from the size of a horse-chestnut. Removed, after death, from a man thirty-six years of age. Thirteen weeks previously he struck his elbow, and one of the tumors soon appeared. The lower one fluctu- ated so distinctly, that at one time it was about to bepunc- tuied. Pleurisy came on three weeks before death, and carried him off. On dissection, several pints of blood and seium were found in the right pleural cavity, and a soft, cancerous mass, of the size of the fist, hung from the294 MORBID ANATOMY. lower lobe of the lung, besides numerous deposits on the pleural surface. There was no disease, however, in any other part of the body. The above is from notes by Dr. Ellis. 1854. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. The six following Thibert’s models were given in 1847. . I)r.

The new bone is generally rather earthy in struc- ture. From a hospital patient, twenty-two years of age (75, 246). Pain in head began about three years before death, and there was gradually developed an increase of pain, throbbing in the left temple, protrusion of the left eye, with failure of vision, and finally an elastic, pulsating tu- mor in the temple; her general health being good. Dr. B. punctured the tumor; subsequently tied the common carotid, and ten days afterward, as the tumor threatened to burst, the other common carotid was tied. This last operation was followed by wakefulness, delirium, coma, hemiplegia, and on the fourth day by death. (No. 1748.) On dissection, a defined and very soft encephaloid tumorMORBID ANATOMY. 295 was found situated about equally within and without the cranium, and containing about four ounces of thick liquid blood ; the brain remaining, after removal, permanently depressed.

From a little girl, thirteen years of age. Duration of the disease eight or ten months. There was a general and haul swelling of the whole thigh, with very severe pain; skin white, and subcutaneous veins enlarged. Three months before death an opening was made in the popliteal space ; and her death was finally caused by erysipelas, and extensive sloughing about this part. The internal organs were healthy. 1857.

A peculiar form of disease of the cranium, connectedMORBID ANATOMY. 296 with a disease of the dura mater, that was probably malig- nant. From a young man, set. twenty, who applied to Dr. W. for exophthalmos of the left eye, on the 19th of June ; vision then perfect, and no cause found for the disease. On the 5th of July he went out in the evening to see the fireworks, and from that time his disease progressed until his death, which occurred on the 8th of August. Discomfort about the eye, with great dimness of vision, followed the expos- ure ; and on the 8th the ophthalmoscope showed haziness of “ outline of disc, with slight hemorrhagic effusions near macula lutea ; ” the right eye being also somewhat affected. On the 10th there was some deafness upon the left side. The eye protruded so that it could not be covered by the lids; the hemorrhage greatly increased ; the pain in the eye and head was such as to require morphine ; and during the last week there was a wandering of the mind. On dissection, by Dr. J. Homans, nothing was found in the orbit to explain the exophthalmos, but behind the left eye there was a rather soft growth from the dura mater, about the size of an English walnut. Toward the vertex the dura mater was very greatly thickened to the extent of 2 or 3 in.; and a vascular, flocculent growth upon the external surface penetrated the diseased bone. Otherwise -the membrane was healthy, as was the brain. Externally there were also flattened morbid growths between the fascia and the pericranium, and that penetrated the bone. Micro- scopically, all of these growths presented appearances that much resembled those of malignant disease. The calvaria, having been removed in the usual way, was found to be diseased throughout the greater part of its extent, internally and externally, but mostly upon the internal surface. A growth of bone arose from this last, in thin laminae, from a line to a line and a half in height, compact in structure, of a pink color, and very finely con- voluted so as to give a somewhat coralloid appearance; the disease being for the most part defined, and commenc- ing with a roughness of the surface. There were also innumerable foramina, and many of them were quite large ; but otherwise they resembled those usually seen in chronicMORBID ANATOMY. 297 ostitis. ^ There were, however, none of the usual appear- ances of inflammation ; and, altogether, the bone was of about the usual thickness. Externally, the foramina ex- ended as far as the soft parts were diseased ; and they were arge, but less numerous than upon the inner surface ; there was also some roughness, as from inflammation. 1869. 1519 Po) . , .

It was at first hard and immovable, but during the last few months softened in spots ; skin not dis- colored ; exquisitely sensitive to the touch, and with severe pain over the whole head. When first seen by Dr. C., in Oct., there was great intolerance of light, with con- tracted pupils, constant nausea, and vomiting of all food ; but these last symptoms were relieved by diet. Dec. 3d, there was reported diarrhoea or constipation alternately; the dejections when loose being involuntary, and also the urine. Mind clear, but slow. Left pupil sluggish and slightly dilated. Jan. 15th, the tumor was about 3 in. in diameter, and projected about 2 in. Vision in left e)re dim. Semi-conscious most of time. Feb. 9th, vision in left eye quite lost, and very dim in right; left pupil permanently dilated. Confined to bed, but sometimes quite bright. She afterward became totally blind, and died April 24th. On dissection, the tumor, which was 2 or 3 in. in di- ameter, was decidedly cancerous in appearance, though not encephaloid ; connected with and extended to the brain ; feeling externally elastic rather than fleshy. Cancerous tumors were also found in the liver and lungs. 1866. Dr. II. L. Chase, of Cambridge. 1514. Section of a rib and of a portion of the ilium that were affected with a very peculiar form of disease. The ster- num and ribs would bend by their own weight; the bony matter having in some parts entirely disappeared, and been replaced in the interior by a soft reddish growth, which, forming in the interior, gradually approached the surface, and reduced the bone to a mere shell, or entirely destroyed it. The whole spine and the right ilium were simi- larly affected. Microscopically, a delicate fibrous struc- ture was found, almost obscured b}r granular corpuscles of about the size of the nuclei of the renal epithelium, which , they resembled very closely; the addition of acetic acid revealing nothing more. Dr. E. supposed that a new material was formed in the bone, and that it was of a cancerous nature, though the disease was entirely limited to the bones. He has seen recorded but one similar case (Virchow’s Archiv. Vol. xxi. p. 407).MORBID ANATOMY. 299 The specimens here shown were from a man forty years of age, who had had severe pains in various parts of his body for several months, and that could never be explained. Gradually lost flesh, and died after a week’s sickness of acute pneumonia. (See Med. Jour. ,Vol. lxvi. p. 67.) 1863- Dr. C. Ellis. 1515. The upper seven inches of the femur removed at the hip- joint. A dried specimen. The patient was thirty-one years of age, and entered the hospital May 29th, 1868 (138, 35). Two }rears previously the thigh had been amputated for “ osteo-sarcoma ” of the leg. About five months before entrance the stump began to discharge and to feel heavy; and, on admission, the whole end formed a very large and hard tumor, that became smaller above, but seemed to involve the bone as far as the joint. The end was covered with small, red, rounded granulations, and feeling like bone covered by a very thin pellicle of skin. Health rather poor for the last three months. On the 2d of June the operation was performed ; and, a tourniquet having been applied over the abdominal aorta, there was but little hemorrhage. Forty-eight ves- sels were tied, and .the flaps required twenty-six sutures. August 1st he was doing well and left the hospital. After that time he improved rapidly, but in Nov. the cicatrix began to be troublesome, and in February the disease had evidently returned. In Dec., 1869, however, his brother states that he is in a fine state of general health, and with- out much, if any, increase of the local disease for some time. On section, the morbid growth is seen to be of a rounded, mushroon-like form, and -completely surrounds and over- hangs the end of the bone; regular and comparatively smooth upon the surface, excepting the granulations at the extiemity, but somewhat laminated, as appears upon sec- tion, and exceedingly irregular where it looks toward the head of the bone. In structure, it consists almost entirely of a piett} compact bone. The disease extends along the surface of the bone to within about an inch of the intertro- chanteric line, in one direction ; and the bone itself, where not involved, looks quite healthy. 1868.

Long, section of a portion of the femur, showing a large cancerous tumor investing the bone ; in spirit. From a lad, sixteen years of age. (Hospital 80, 219, and Med. Jour. Vol. lx. p. 329.) An immovable and slightly painful tumor was first noticed seven months before en- trance, and increased slowly. When seen, the thigh was , flexed, and the upper half occupied by a firm and painful tumor, which was distinct and somewhat nodulated in front, and in contact with Poupart’s ligament; indefinite behind ; the circumference being 7 in. greater than that of its mate. There was some motion in the joint, and the lad, though very lame, could walk with support. Amputated at the hip-joint, March 28th, 1859, and the artery having been first tied, and the aorta being compressed, scarcely any blood was lost. Secondary hemorrhage occurred on the twenty- fourth day, but the patient rallied from the effects of it, and was discharged well on the 10th of May. He died, how- ever, some months afterward, with pain in his back ; and nothing more is known of the final result. The diseased growth surrounded the bone, arose from its surface, and extended from the middle of the shaft to the neck ; being cancerous in its general appearance, and also miscroscopicalty. In structure there were some spieulm of bone, but it consisted mainly of a firm, coarse, fleshy substance. Parietes of the bone somewhat thickened mid- way, and the central cavitjr mostly obliterated ; but other- wise there was nothing remarkable. 1861. Dr. J. 31. Warren. 1518. Long, section of the upper half of the femur, which was surrounded by a cancerous growth ; in spirit. From a man, thirty-nine years of age. Entered the hos- pital April 3d, 1858 (78, 48). Struck the thigh about thirteen months previously, and about ten months before admission, pain came on with hardness, and subsequently some external inflammation ; pain at last excruciating, with constitutional affection. On the 17th a piece of the tumor was removed, and found microscopically, by Dr. Ellis, toMORBID ANATOMY. 301 be partly fibro-plastic and partly cancerous. Death on the 27th. The tumor, which was 8 inches in length and about 5 in. in diameter, was lobulated externally, firm, and con- sisted of a yellowish-white, coarse, fibrous structure with some cretaceous deposit and infiltrated with a glairy fluid. The fibres stood off perpendicularly from the surface of the bone, which was quite rough, with some absorption ; and the interior was filled with a very dense ossific matter as far as the tumor extended. Microscopically, “ nothin** was noticed,” by Dr. Ellis, “ but a fibroid material con- taining globules like those of fat.” 1858. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1519. Long, section of the lower half of the femur, and showing a cancerous growth connected with the back part of the bone; in spirit. From a lad, fifteen years of age. (Hospital, 78, 196.) The disease was of three months’ duration, and began with swelling and moderate pain. Whole popliteal space filled with the diseased growth, and amputated at once. The tumor was 4 in. in extent, and adhered to the bone thioughout; structure fleshy, and microscopically cancer- ous ; cavity adjoining the bone, and where the disease is most advanced. Bone soft and gradually merged in the tumor, which is supposed to have arisen from it. At the hospital is a colored drawing of the recent specimen. 1850. Dr. S. D. Townsend. Io20. A drawing in water-colors, showing the appearances, on a recent section, of a case of osteoid cancer of the upper part of the tibia. The patient, a delicate little girl, eleven years of age, was iicked on the shin by a schoolmate seven months before entrance into the hospital (74, 178). In four days pain and swelling came on, and increased daily. The pain was constant, deep, generally dull, and often severe. Amputa- tion in, above the condyles ; bone diseased, and for some Vf6 „le s*umP did Rot do well. She remained in the hos- pital for some weeks; and, meanwhile, a tumor, of the size o a ien s egg, formed about the sternal end of the clavicle.MORBID ANATOMY. 302 After she left, all that is known of her case is that she lost the sight of her left eye. The upper half of the bone was enlarged, increasing from below upward, and measuring 3£ in. across the cut surface at the largest jiart. Structure almost entirely osseous, but with some mixture of a coarse fibroid substance. No un- usual vascularity, nor other appearance of inflammation. Neither were there any of the usual appearances of cancer, though the microscope left little if any doubt of the nature of the disease. See the two next specimens. 1857. Museum Fund. 1521. One-half of the above tibia thoroughly macerated and dried; and showing how very large a portion of the tumor is osseous. The new growth which had formed about the bone is light and fragile, so that several small portions were lost in the preparation ; somewhat lobulated upon the external surface in some parts, and very slightly radiated in some others upon the cut surface. The outline of the original bone is distinctly traceable through the tumor; not enlarged, but the walls are for the most part light and earthy; and the cavity is filled up with the morbid osseous growth to the extent of 2 in. below where the disease begins externally, as appears in the next specimen. 1857. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 1522. The other half of the above tibia, macerated for a few dajrs in water, then in spirit, and then dried; seeming to consist almost wholly of bony matter.

Osteoid cancer of the bones of the forearm. A longitu- dinal section having been made through the tumor, aud to some extent through the healthy bones above it, one-half has been macerated, dried, aud separately mounted; and the other half (No. 1524) has been preserved in spirit. The tumor began at the lower extremity of the bones, ex- tends upward about 4 in., and was nearly half as large again as the first. The form was rather oval, and the sur- face smooth, but deepl}r grooved by the tendons. The sur-303 MORBID ANATOMY. rounding parts, being quite healthy, have been removed. The structure is mainly osseous, light, brittle, and fibrous ; many parts externally suggesting the idea of some kind of coral or of sponge; some of the spiculae being very delicate. Nowhere foliated, compact, nor at all pulverulent. The fleshy portion of the tumor consisted of a white, dense, fibrous tissue. The two bones were firmly connected by the morbid growth ; the outline of the ulna being through- out sufficiently distinct; and the very lower extremity quite healthy. The radius, in which the disease seems to have commenced, is traceable to a considerable extent, but be- low this it is quite lost in the tumor; the bones not being enlarged so far as they are traced, and their cavities being obliterated so far as the tumor extends. In the present dried specimen a large section has been made near the sur- face, to show the structure, and some fragments are seen that were detached by maceration. A piece is also seen of the size of a large nutmeg, but of a flattened, oval form, and that in the recent state was entirely distinct from the main tumor, though in close apposition with it; this piece being movable as a distinct mass, before the amputation. From a healthy young lady, twenty-four years of age. In 1857 she sprained her wrist. Six or eight weeks after- ward a tumor appeared on the radius, and slowly increased ; and subsequently others on the ulna. In 1860-1 portions were removed at three different times. In April, ’62, when she entered the hospital (101, 174), the tumor was 12 in. in circumference, having doubled in size the previous year ; regarded beyond question as enchondroma, from its some- what knobbed form and densely elastic feel. The limb was amputated 4 in. below the elbow, on the 12th, and she wras discharged May 12th. At the end of a year or more there was no return of the disease. 1863. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 1524.

From the dissecting-i’oom ; and, having been injected, the arteries about the seat of disease were found obliterated. Upon the right side a portion of the ramus remains, but otherwise it is destroyed nearly to the median line. Upon the other side the structure of the bone is light where it terminated in the disease; but there is very little deposit upon the surface, and none of the delicate spiculae so often seen in encephaloid disease. 1858.

Dr. W. has met with this form of atrophy in three other cases, and does not think it due to the action of the tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle, as some have sup- posed. Cases are also referred to by Mr. Humphry in his work on the Skeleton (p. 142).

A second skeleton, greatly deformed. Dr. W. reported, in the Med. Jour. Vol. xxvi. p. 171, of this case as follows: “ The subject of this skeleton was an Indian, one of the Six Nations, and died at the age of twenty-one. His mode of locomotion was by a large wooden bowl, in which he sat and moved forward, by advancing first one side of the bowl and then the other, by means of his hands. He was very unhealthy, and had the characteristics of a rickety subject. I always considered the adventitious joints as the result of imperfect ossifica- tion ; or, in other words, of motion before ossification was completed.” The long bones of all of the extremities are very greatly distorted, and the pelvis still more so. Spine sufficiently well; and also the head, except that the loss of the teeth gives the appearance of advanced age. The whole skeleton, ’ excepting the head, is more or less atrophied, or deficient in earthy matter ; and many of the bones, when soaked in water lor preparation, were very soft. The “ adventitious joints are very numerous in the long bones and ribs, and piesent the usual appearances of partial fracture in a young bone, nodosity, without displacement. In the original preparation the muscles were preserved ; but some years ago they were removed, and most of the skeleton was articulated by Dr. N. B. Skurtleff. 1847.MORBID AX ATOMY. 308 1546.

The line of the spinous processes is much straighter than that of the bodies. Structure as in the above case. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. For the external appearances in case of lateral curvature, see next series. 1550. The whole spine, as low as the sacrum, with the thorax. Curvature of spine both lateral and backward.

The three following specimens have been described and figured by Dr. J. Wyman, in his “ Observations on Cra- nia,” —1868. 1551. A deformed cranium, “from a somewhat aged subject. The sagittal suture is wholl3r, and the coronal, lambdoidal, and squamous sutures are partially closed. The index of the foramen magnum is 43.9, showing that the head has been lengthened forward more than backward.” The long.MORBID ANATOMY. 309 diameter of the cranium, according to Dr. W.’s method of measurement, being considered 100, 43.9 represents the distance from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum to the most projecting part of the occiput. In the crania of twenty whites, Dr. W. found the mean index of the fora- men magnum to be 45.6. “ A third articular surface ex- ists in the middle of the fore edge of the foramen magnum, and corresponds with the apex of the odontoid process of the axis. It is a smooth, oval depression, with slightly raised borders, and has the appearance of having been covered with an articular cartilage; it is supported by a very slight elevation of bone, as in the cases of condylus tertius, described by Dr. Halbertsma. When viewed from behind, this cranium is remarkable for the manner in which the lateral walls slope toward the vertex.” 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1552. A second specimen. “ Supposed to be from a subject about three years old. The sagittal suture is wholly ob- literated ; the median ridge and the vascular openings, with a peculiar radiated appearance, as also the appear- ance of a median centre of ossification, exist here in a marked degree. This cranium is remarkable for its great length; the index of breadth being only 62.6. The fora- men magnum is central; the increase in length having taken place equally forwards and backwards. This also appears from the equal protuberance of both forehead and occiput. The occipital region presents outwardly, as it were, a cast of the cerebellum ; two bulgings, corresponding with the lateral lobes, project downwards beyond the tips of the mastoid processes. The hinder lobes of the cere- brum can also be traced in a similar way, and form a third bulging in the outer surface of the occiput.” 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1553. A third specimen. Cranium of a foetus, in which the de- formity from elongation of the head was, in the recent state, very strongly marked. “ The lengthening of the head is almost wholly for- wards ; the index of the foramen magnum being only 32.2. The anterior fontanelle i§ largely open, and is prolonged between the frontals, by a space with parallel sides, twenty310 MORBID ANATOMY. millimeters in breadth, extending nearly to the nasals. The sagittal suture is completely obliterated in the middle portion, for the space of nearly an inch; for the rest of its extent it is open, the two parietals approaching each other quite closely ; in the fore part the edges are smooth and straight, and in the hinder somewhat serrated, but do not touch. The frontals are very protuberant, and on the inside of each, corresponding very nearly with the frontal eminences, are two marked depressions, causing the bone to appear diaphanous in some parts ; but, in others, extend- ing quite through ; each of these is surrounded by a ridge of dense bone, quite unusual in a foetal cranium. These deformities may be compared to the digital impressions of the adult crania.” 1867. 1554. A fourth skull; deformed, but less so than the above. 1555. A fifth ; cast in plaster. 1556.

At the age of two and of four years, the ankle and knee joints enlarged ; and from this last period she was confined to her bed; the lower extremities being drawn up upon the abdomen, and the upper extremities distorted. There were occasionally slight spasms lasting through the day ; sometimes intense pain; a gradual loss of muscular power, and during the last month much dyspnoea. Mind quite bright. On dissection, there was found strong lateral curvature of the spine. Shafts of all of the long bones, so far as examined, very slender and thin, and the epiphyses greatly enlaiged ; or, at least, by comparison. Muscles generally in a state of fatty degeneration.

The stump did not heal for a long time, was very painful, and he had never been able to wear an artificial leg. Feb. 12th 1868, he entered the hospital (134, 180), with much pain at the end of the stump, and a firm attachment of the cicatrix to the ends of the bones at that part. On pressure between the ends of the bones, the limb was instantly thrown into violent convulsions. A year previously a sequestrum had been removed. On the day of his admission the bones were removed, and on the 11th of March the man was dis- charged well.

Dr. J. C. Warren. 1601. A transverse section from the extremity of an amputated femur. The original bone is thin, rough upon the surface, as usual in sequestra, and shows at the extremity the smooth cut of the saw. Loosely surrounding this is a thick, coarse, and almost earthy-looking periosteal deposit. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1602. Exfoliation from the femur, after amputation, 6 in. in length and rough upon the surface, but involving almost throughout the entire circumference of the bone. From a man who entered the hospital (33, 162), Nov. 27th, 1847, with a recent wound of the femoral artery, and for which the vessel was tied by Dr. IL, Dec. 18th. Mortifi- cation soon followed, and the limb was amputated by Dr. Parkman on the 10th of Jan. On the 20th the end of the bone was exposed, and the following June it had become loose; the whole stump being enlarged and indurated as by a new osseous deposit around the sequestrum. This last was removed on the 22d of June, and considerable foice was required. August 5th, 1848, the stump was doing well, and the man was discharged. This specimen and the two last form, together, an inter- esting series, as showing the progress of exfoliation from an amputated stump. 1848. Dr. Geo. Hayward. 1603. Upper two-thirds of the femur, removed after death, and about seven weeks after amputation. (See No. 1439.) The stump healed rapidly and thoroughly, except at one point, from which a discharge was almost constant until death. On dissection, the periosteum was found inflamed, and the cavity of the bone closed at its extremity by a soft substance. Artery plugged up to the extent of 4 in.; and the sciatic nerve was larger than usual, but not bulging v lune divided. In the prepared specimen, a small exfolia- tion is seen to be going on from the end of the bone; and the sui face of this last shows the effects of inflammation. Dr. S. D. Townsend.316 MORBID ANATOMY. 1604. A portion of femur, 3£ in. in length, removed from a stump, and showing the effects of inflammation ; enlarged, rough upon the surface, and with a sinus in its substance, containing a delicate sequestrum. From a man, set. twenty-five, whose limb was amputated by Dr. H. J. Bigelow, for disease of the knee-joint, Nov. 12th, 1864. A flap was taken in front, and a direct cut made down upon the bone behind ; the periosteum was then scraped up ; and, after sawing the bone, it was brought down and secured by a suture ; after which the anterior flap was brought down. The stump never healed, and the end of the bone came away, with, occasionally, smaller pieces. On readmission into the hospital (127, 224), the bone was enlarged and very prominent; the soft parts being closety attached, and the whole very tender. Ampu- tated by Dr. H., Dec. 8th, 1866, and the man was dis- charged well Jan. 11th. 1867. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1605. Inflamed bone from a stump; and a very fine specimen. From a soldier, ret. twrenty-three, whose thigh was ampu- tated July 21st, 1866, for a recent injury. The wound never healed, and he entered the hospital June 15th, 1867 (132, 102), very much exhausted, with swelling of the stump; protrusion of the bone, and a copious and very offensive discharge. July 17th, about 2J in. of the bone were removed, and on the 19th of August the man was discharged well. The bone is very much enlarged, and shows the result of chronic inflammation. By the side of it is a pretty thick semi-cylindrical sequestrum, from the cavity of the bone, 5 in. in length, and that was sawed across midway at the time of the operation. 1867. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1606. Exfoliation 3£ in. in length, from the end of a stump; four and a half months after amputation of the femur, for a railroad accident. From a man, set. thirty-two years (Hospital, 85, 220) ; discharged well in about six months. Whole circumfer- ence of bone involved inferiorly. 1860. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1607. About 2 in. of the femur removed from an amputated stump.MORBID ANATOMY. 317 From a healthy man, aet. forty-two. (Hospital, 39, 80.) Thigh amputated for necrosis, May 30th. Extensive sup- puration followed ; and, after a time, about 2 in. of bone were discharged, including the entire circumference where it had been sawed. (No. 1608.) July 21st, the end of the bone was removed ; surrounded by a thick mass of fleshy vegetations. The patient, having previously been much' re- duced, recovered rapidly after the operation. 1849. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1608. Exfoliation from the above case. 1849. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1609. Longitudinal section of a portion of the femur after am- putation ; dried. From a boy, set. thirteen j^ears. (Hospital 118, 224, and Med. Jour. Yol. lxxiii. 218.) A horse-railroad accident. Amputated at once; and there was profuse hemorrhage from the medulla. On the 9th day a portion of the stump was ununited ; and a large fungous growth, protruding from the medullary cavity, was removed. On the 13th day tetanus came on, and on the 18th the boy died. A very exuberant growth of new bone surrounds the femur about a third of an inch above ■where it was sawed; and above this, to the extent of about 3 in., is a thin periosteal deposit. The very extremity of the bone is smooth externally, and was preparing to exfoliate. The medulla, so far as the bone was removed, was of a dark chocolate color, infiltrated with lymph so as to render it firm and resistant; filling the medullary cavity tightly as if swollen, and bulging out from the end of the bone in the form of a flattened button. No pus was anywhere found. Dr. H. remarked upon the hemorrhage from the medulla, the late period at which the tetanus appeared, and their , pathological connection with the osteo-myelitis ; referring to Dr. Allen’s paper upon this last subject in the American Journal of the Med. Sciences, Jan., 1865. 1610. The other half of the femur, from the above case; in spirit. 1865. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1G11.

A long, section having been made, one- half has been preserved in spirit, and the other half dried ; showing that the union is not by bone, though there is a small cretaceous mass adjoining the line of fracture. This last is probably due to the age of the subject, as the same change is seen in the cartilage at a distance from the frac- ture." 1855. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1616.

There was no explanation for the rupture; and one or two other similar cases have been observed here. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1618. Extensive rupture of the tendinous - portion of the • diaphragm upon the left side. From a man who was run over by a loaded wagon, and died just after his arrival at the hospital (69, 43). The greater part of the stomach and omentum, with the spleen and a large portion of the descending colon had passed through into the left pleural cavity ; these organs, excepting the colon, being preserved in connection with the diaphragm. The left kidney also is seen to be very extensively fractured, and almost torn away from its attachments ; the pancreas was nearly torn across, and there were several pints of effused blood, with other minor injuries. 1855. 1619. The last phalanx of the thumb torn off, and the whole of the long flexor drawn out; a dry specimen. From a boy, who made no complaint of the forearm, ex- cepting a slight tenderness for the first two or three days ; and who returned to his work on the nineteenth day after the accident. Dr. M. remarked upon this case as showing how the re- parative processes are carried on in wounds that are entirely excluded from the air, and its bearing upon the safety of subcutaneous incisions. Several similar cases have occurred here, and the same remark might be made of all of them. 1854. Dr. Henry 0.

Locomotion was effected on the anterior extremity of the os calcis, and the proper superior surface of the os cuboides ; or, in other words, upon the top of the feet. As shown in the casts, there was a longitudinal doubling, or complete folding inward of the soles, forming a deep groove, by which the great and little toes were brought almost in contact. The prominence of the head of the astragalus upon the dorsum of each foot is also shown. The other was similarly affected. 1863. 1645. The same foot, twelve years afterward. The man, mean- while, had been a sailor, and stated that he had never ex- perienced any inconvenience from his feet; and, when he exhibited himself at one of the meetings of the Society for Med. Improvement, there certainly was very little, if any, trace of the former distortion. The accompanying figures give a perfect idea of the two casts, except that it is the left foot that has been represented. 1863. 1646-8. Varus of left foot, before treatment. Tendo-achillis, tib. ant. and post., and the flexor long, pollicis divided twice. The same, immediately after treatment; and again,thir- teen years afterward.

An index finger, amputated by Dr. Bigelow ; and show- ing a tumor connected with the extensor tendon, that he regards as a “ hypertrophy of its investing membrane.” From a man, aet. forty-two, who entered the hospital Nov. 11th (141,253). Tumor around the metacarpo-phal. articulation, of the size of an English walnut, extending somewhat towards the palm ; painless, and feeling like an enchoudroma. Integument not affected; and motion of the joint good. Duration five years. In the spring it had been incised; and about a drachm of fluid, like the white of an egg, was discharged. On the 13th Dr. B. removed the finger, with nearly the whole of the metacarpal bone. The tumor extended nearly to the carpus, was about the size of a pullet’s egg, white, dense to the feel, somewhat knobbed, and discharged, on incision, a yellowish, gelatinous substance, that was con- tained in fine meshes of a white fibrous tissue. The ten- don, beneath the bone and the tumor, seemed to be merged in this last. The man did well, and left the hospital on the 26th. 1869. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1670.

Three years before he entered the hospital (79, 226) ; the knee was inflamed for a time. Two months before entrance it got worse again, and a red and tender spot appeared over the inside of the tibia, and 3 in. below the joint. On pressure there, a fluid re- treated as if into a cavity behind; and, on making an opening, a clear, synovial fluid was discharged, and there were pressed up, apparently from behind the external head of the gastrocnemius muscle, about a pint of a buff-colored, feebly organized lymph. Inflammation and suppuration of the joint followed ; five weeks afterward the thigh was amputated, and the patient did well. In the upper back part of the tibia was a small excava- tion, connected with the original cyst; and at that part this last was supposed to have communicated with the cavity of the joint. 1859. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1673. A cyst, that contained a large quantity of “ melon-seed bodies,” and that was removed by Dr. Bigelow, from over the shoulder. From a man, ret. thirty. About a year before he entered the hospital (83, 241), the tumor appeared; and, when seen, was as large as a cocoa-nut, soft, rounded, quite fluctuating, and with little or no pain. About two ounces of fluid having been drawn off, the movement of the bodies within was felt; and, on incision, about § x. of them were removed. The finger was passed under the deltoid, and about the head of the bone. Cavity lined by a light- colored, serous-looking membrane, with bands in the pari- etes of the cyst; soft, velvety red masses adhering and covering the outer surface of the bone and capsule, whilst the smoother parts were lined by flakes of recent false membrane. The cyst was dissected out, and the patient was dis- charged well in three weeks and a half. The loose bodies,MORBID ANATOMY. 331 the largest of which were from one-half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter, were formed of concentric layers; several sometimes adhering together; and having a com- mon envelope; much larger than those that adhered to the capsule, and not vascular as they were. 1859.

Severe inflammation followed, but passed off in three or four weeks, and for six months he had no further trouble. The knee then swelled, and the loose body was first felt. From that time he had frequent attacks of pain and swelling, but complained mostly of the loose body slipping between the femur and tibia.

When recent the articular surface was as smooth and denuded as it now appears, except to a small extent around the circum- ference, where there was a thick, red, pulpy structure, that it was thought might be the remains of a diseased synovial membrane. The periosteum also was thickened, red, and friable for 3 in. or more above the joint; and there was a free external opening into the cavity of the joint, with a large abscess in the neighboring parts. From a sailor, set. fifty-two (Hospital, 55, 40), who had had an ulcer on the penis a year before, aphonia with dys- phagia for three months, connected with ulceration of the larynx and disease of the cartilages, and a node upon the tibia; general health poor.

From a lad, set. seventeen. Attacked five weeks before death with pain and great dyspnoea. On the third day these symptoms disappeared and never returned ; but there came on at once violent nervous symptoms, —delirium, strabis- mus, etc. Dr. Bowditch saw him six daj^s before death, and found signs of “ pericardial effusion to a considerable extent,” but without the nervous symptoms.

A second specimen. — From a man, aet. fifty, who had been previously healthy, but had suffered for eight weeks before his death from pulmonary symptoms and occasional palpitation, after sleeping in a cold, damp room. There was also a cardiac murmur. Death at last sudden, and in an exceedingly severe paroxysm of dyspnoea. The cavity of the pericardium contained § iij. of fluid blood. The rupture was 1$ in. from the apex, anteriorly, nearly over the septum, five lines in length, looked like an incised wound, and was found to communicate with the cavity of the right ventricle ; a stream of dark blood issu- ing from it when the heart was raised. The organ itself weighed 17£ oz.; and all of the cavities were dilated, with disease of the aortal valves and of the aorta. The patient had been in the hospital (271, 64) under the care of Dr. S. 1867. Dr. G. C. Shattuck. 1705. Extensive laceration of the interventricular septum.

Interventricular opening, — congenital or the result of rupture; with an aneurism, at the origin of the aorta, that projected and finally burst into the right ventricle. The patient was a robust and perfectly healthy youno- man, nineteen years of age. About five months before hit sickness he arrived in New York harbor in a war-vessel; and, to escape from it, jumped overboard, swam about one- 61° 1 ° a m^e’ anc* ^ien walked to his home, a distance of about two hundred miles; and all this he bore perfectly About Dec. 1st, 1860, when liftin suddenly seized with a sharp and 22 g a heavy stone, he was severe pain across the;MORBID ANATOMY. 338 lower front part of the chest and extending around to the back ; the pain lasting through the day with slight cough and hemoptisis ; and from this time he had dyspnoea on any unusual exertion. When Dr. Gage saw him on the 21st, a very distinct purring thrill was felt over almost the whole front of the chest, — very strong over the heart, and most intense over the aortal valves. Dulness over the heart to the extent of 4 in. Systolic and diastolic bellows murmur very superficial, and heard 1 or 2 inches from the chest; most marked over aortal orifice, and heard along the aorta and great vessels from the arch. Impulse increased, and strong in the subclavians.' Pulse about 80, small, thrilling, and occasionally intermitting. On the evening of Jan. 20th he went, as a spectator, to a dance ; was out late, and drank somewhat freely. After his return home he had great dyspnoea, and vomited severely. On the 21st he had frightful paroxj'sms of suffocation, with cold perspiration and great lividity ; and during the follow- ing night he was in extreme agony. On the 22d he was kept quiet by opiates, but he died that night. On dissection, a serous effusion was found in the cavities of the thorax and abdomen. The heart was more than twice its usual size; the right ventricle being relatively thicker than the left. The interventricular opening had * the form of a half circle, and would easily admit the little finger ; the crescentic edge toward the septum being thick and rounded. The pulmonary valves were nearly or quite normal. The aneurism, which arose from one of the pouches just at the aortal valves, was extremely delicate and thin, and would just admit the last phalanx of the fore- finger and about one-fourth of the next. These points are, nearly all of them, shown in the preparation. Dr. G. supposed that the aneurism dated from the lift- ing of the stone, but that the interventricular opening was congenital. It appeared to me, however, that both of these conditions were due to the lifting, insufficient as the cause may seem to have been, — in consideration of the pre- viously perfect health, the date of symptoms*- from that time, the condition of the pulmonary valves, which seem to be so very generally abnormal in one way or another in339 MORBID ANATOMY. case of interventricular opening, and the existence of the aneurism, which must be exceedingly rare if it ever occurs as a complication of interventricular opening, and which would therefore predispose one to look upon this case as not one of common interventricular opening. The rupture of the aneurism, of course, occurred a day or two before death. The question must have been between a congenital opening and rupture ; for there was no appearance of disease at the opening, though there was the aneurism quite near to it. In May, 1869, the case was submitted to Dr. Thomas B. Peacock, of London, who has written a very full and ex- cellent work upon Malformations of the Heart; and his answer was that he “ should feel disposed to think that the opening must have resulted from disease or accident, and this mainly in consequence of the absence of any evidence of congenital defect of the pulmonary artery.” See Med.

Two months previously, and being then as well as usual, he had rheumatism, which in two weeks left him, and car- diac symptoms then came on, that obliged him to give up his business. There was dyspnoea, but scarcely any palpi- tation ; a systolic bellows murmur over the mitral valve, and a slight aortic souffle after the second sound. Death very sudden on the third day after admission. The heart weighed 17£ oz. and was universally thick- ened and dilated. Aortic valves thickened and retracted ; with a soft, whitish deposit upon the under surface of one, and also upon the mitral valve and the inner surface of the left auiicle. The laceration in the valve would admit the last joint of the little finger, when recent. There was also a laige serous effusion in the cavities of the pericardium and right pleura; with disease of the spleen. (Series XL.) In the preparation the mitral and aortic valves are shown. 1860.

On dissection, there was found old and very extensive adhesion of the pericardium, some dilatation and thickening of the left ventricle, with considerable disease though no ossification of the mitral valves. The passage through the aortal valves was not greatly obstructed; the portions that were not ossified not being particularly diseased.

A fibrinous mass from the heart of a right whale ; dried. It is of a flattened, pyriform shape, 6 in. in length, 4|- in. across the widest part, and 1|- in. in thickness. Dr. G-. received it from an experienced whaler, who said that the animal whs an old one, and in good condition, though it had been previously harpooned, and that it was taken last year, near the Azores. The growth was attached by its small extremity to the adherent edge of one of the valves ; and in another cavity of the heart was a perfectly similar formation. Dr. J. C. White, who examined the specimen, found, externally, a very dense, organized, fibrous material, about & in. in thickness; and within this shell a very loose, spongy substance, somewhat fatty, and containing a large quantity of inorganic matter, with carb. and phosph. of lime. 1867. Dr. Alfred C. Garratt. 1738. Aneurism of the heart. — A portion of the organ pre- served, and shows a circumspribed dilatation of the left ventricle at its apex ; the parietes at this part being thin, white-opaque, fibrous, and inelastic. Rupture had taken place into the pericardial cavity, which last contained, in the lecent state, a large quantity of blood. Otherwise, the organ was healthy. Fiom a man, set. fifty-nine, who had had cardiac S3mip- toms for two or three years. During the last month he was seen by Dr. W.; and the chief symptoms were urgent d} spnoea, a severe pain beneath the sternum, and occasion- ally an irregular pulse. He was sitting up, and talking quite cheerfully, when he fell back and died instantly. 1856‘ Dr. Charles E. Ware. 1739. Heart entire.

A small portion of the heart, from a man who died from Addison’s disease. It shows a defined aneurismal pouch, about the size of a filbert, at the very upper part of the septum, opening largely from the left ventricle, and pro- jecting into the cavity of the right. The parietes are formed b}r a distension of the thin, fibro-cellular tissue that is found at this part of the septum ; and, if it had rup- tured, the #ase might have been regarded as one of con- genital opening. 1860. Dr. C. Ellis. 1741. The heart of a sheep, completely and thickly enveloped in fat, externally. The muscular substance is infiltrated with the same, and upon the right side has nearly disap- peared ; thick masses of fat standing out into the cavity of the right ventricle, and covered only by the lining mem- brane. Organ altogether much enlarged. Valves healthy. Foramen ovale open. The animal was slaughtered for the market, and had not been thought of as in any way remarkable. 1852. Dr. Samuel ParTcman. The bearing of the above case upon that of fatty degen- eration of the heart in man, and to which so much impor- tance is generally attached, deserves a remark. 1742. Thibert’s model.

A preparation, to show the state of the arteries four years after the left subclavian had been tied. Case pub- lished by Dr. J. C. Warren, in the twenty-ninth volume of the Med. Chirurg. Trans. (London, 1846), after the per- formance of the operation; and the final result by Dr. F. S. Ainsworth, in the American Jour, of Med. Sciences, Jan., 1850. The patient, a man, set. thirty-five, entered the hospital Dec. 23, 1843 (27, 281). The left shoulder had just been dislocated and reduced ; but there was great swelling and pain, with ecchymosis; and the axillary artery was sup- posed, without question, to have been ruptured. He be- came worse; the radial pulse ceased, and a tumor in the axilla opened on the 28th of January, and discharged a thin, bloody fluid, after which a feeble pulse returned. Oozing of blood continued; and, a copious hemorrhage having occurred on the 7th of February, the artery was tied on the following day, above the clavicle, by Dr. W. The pleural cavity was accidentally punctured during the opera- tion, but without any bad consequences. On the thirteenth day the ligature came away ; and on the twenty-third and thirty-third days hemorrhages took place to the amount of a pint and a half; but these were checked by a sponge tampon, and from that time he had very little trouble with the wound above the clavicle. The swelling in the axilla, however, continued to discharge pus, and was very pain- ful ; and on the 23d of March a large coagulum came away, with a copious discharge of pus, and relief to pain. From this time, until he left the hospital in September, 1845, he gradually improved ; but the axillary abscess con- tinued to discharge, and the shoulder-joint was immovable. Some months after his discharge he entered the almshouse, and there acted as a ward-tender until he died of dysentery in Oct., 1848. Having given up his body for dissection, the arteries were injected by Dr. Ainsworth, and the preparation made by him ; one-half of the thorax, with the scapula, being349 MORBID ANATOMY. preserved. The subclavian, where it issues from between the scaleni muscles, is reduced to a mere cord, but regains nearly its natural size at the distance of three-fourths of an inch. The collateral circulation was carried on by the intercostal branches of the int. mammary artery, and the thoracic branches of the thoracico-acromialis; and by a large inosculation between the suprascapular artery, and a branch of the subscapular. A communication was also traced between some small muscular branches of the trans- verse cervical, and the thoracico-acromialis. The dense cellular tissue that invested the axillary artery was not entirely removed when the preparation was made ; but Dr. A. having recently (1866) done this, after thor- oughly softening it, the artery is seen to be continuous, and of full size. It must, then, have been some large branch, only, that was ruptured at the time of the accident. 1849. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1751. A portion of the aorta, showing the coeliac artery com- pletely closed by old fibrine; the clot projecting slightly into the cavity of the vessel, and having a ragged look, as if a “ prolonged thrombus,” as Virchow calls it, may have been broken off. Rather more than an inch above this is a second old clot, £ in. long, and less than two lines in width. This last is attached by one extremit}r, and hangs off into the cavity of the aorta, but no vessel can be seen from which it has protruded. A portion of the femoral, and of one other artery from the left lower extremity is also shown, filled with fibrine. The aorta, generally, was very much diseased, as shown by the specimen. From a lady, set. sixty-eight, who had been much sub- ject to headache for many years ; also to cardiac symp- toms for about three years, though no disease of the heart was found. About three months before her death she was attacked with a very intense pain in the region of the left kidney, and which Dr. M. connected with the disease of the coeliac artery. In the course of a week this had sub- sided ; but the large amount of opium and of chloroform that was required to relieve it caused a great deal of nau- sea and vomiting, that lasted for some time, and that never entirely left her. Two months before her death she began350 MORBID ANATOMY. to have pain and numbness in the left lower extremity; the pain being mostly below the knee, and gradually in- creasing until it became very intense. Three weeks before death the left foot became gangrenous, and the outer half of the foot and leg at last sphacelated; the inner portion never becoming affected. A line of demarcation having formed below the knee, Dr. M. amputated the thigh, but onl}r as a palliative ; the branches of the profunda bleeding freely, though the femoral was closed. The operation quite relieved the pain in the leg, and the patient died on the sixth day. The right external iliac arteiy was filled with recent fibrine ; and, upon the left side, some of the arteries below the knee, as well as the femoral, were filled with old fibrine. (See Med. Jour.

A very great, and apparently uniform dilatation of the aorta, from its origin to the vessels at the arch ; one small sac only being engrafted upon it. The cavity must have been large enough to have contained a foetal head, and the parietes are greatly diseased. Just beyond the arch the vessel contracts abruptly to its natural size, and is per- fectly healthy. The heart, which is also preserved, has been cut open into the left ventricle, and with the aortal valves is seen to be healthy. In spirit. 1849. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1763. Aorta greatly enlarged and diseased, and the art. innom- inata three times its usual size. Every one who had examined the patient from whom this specimen was taken, felt confident that there was an aneurism of one of these vessels ; and the surgeons of the hospital (134, 237) unan- imously advised a distal ligature upon the right carotid and subclavian; but no trace of an aneurism was found. There was a distinct and strongly pulsating tumor above the top of the sternum, with souffle; and from this tumor the car. and subcl. seemed to arise. There was also cough with dysphagia and dyspnoea; and toward the last these symptoms became very urgent. The ligatures were therefore applied; and the patient died, on the eleventh day, apparently from exhaustion. Dr. H. has fully re- ported this case in the Med. Jour. Aug. 6th, 1868. 1868. Dr. R. M.

Two or three ounces of blood were found in the pericar- dium ; and the aorta was ruptured just above the valves, and to the extent of about two-thirds of its circumference. The internal coats had given way, and the‘blood had dis- sected a passage for itself as far as the internal iliacs, where the inner coat of the right iliac again ruptured, and the blood had returned into its proper channel. The branches from the arch were also dissected. This dis- section of the aorta involved mostly the posterior parietes of the aorta, and nearly or quite one-half of its circum- ference ; the fibres of the middle coat being seen upon both surfaces along the false passage. The tissues of the artery were nowhere much diseased ; and apparently quite healthy at the place of rupture, though there was an ap- pearance near it as of an old laceration that had been cica- trized. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., Oct. 1848, p. 300.) 1848. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1766. A third specimen. This cage and the last occurring • within thirteen days of each other. From a patient of Dr. B. E. Cotting; sixty years of age, and a liealthy-looking man, though dyspeptic. Ate heartily of ham at breakfast, to which he was not accustomed, and again at noon. In the evening he had nausea, and took an emetic; but noth- ing unusual occurred until about 2 a. m., when his wife was awoke by his oppressed breathing, and he soon died. The cavity of the pericardium contained about six ounces of fluid and blood ; and in the aorta was a lacera- tion, about half way between the valves and the arch, through the entire thickness of the vessel, and extending spirally so as to more than involve its circumference. The pericardium is stripped up from the anterior face of the aorta, and forms a large cavit}^ that was filled with blood, and finally burst. In structure the asc. aorta was almost perfectly healthy, and the desc. portion only mod- erately diseased ; the edges of the laceration being as smooth as if cut with a knife. The heart and other organs353 MORBID ANATOMY. were well. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., Oct. 1848, p. 301.) 1848. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1767. A fourth specimen. The laceration commences 2 in. • beyond the left subclavian artery; and the blood was mostly between the outside of the thoracic aorta and the spine, though to some extent the parietes of the vessel have been dissected apart.

Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1768. A fifth specimen. At the arch, posteriorly, is a longi- • tudinal laceration, 2 in. in length, and extending through the inner and middle coats. The blood had forced its way between the middle and external coats as far as the iliacs, upward into the right subclavian and carotid arteries, and down toward the heart, near which is a small opening into the pericardium ; the cavity of this last containing a large amount of blood. Ill the arch of the aorta were two or three small atheromatous spots, but not along the rupture ; beyond this there was more disease, but nowhere much. From Dr. H., oet. fifty-nine, and always healthy. His death at last was instantaneous; but five days before, he had what seemed to be an attack of apoplexy, and to which he seemed predisposed. He complained, however, just as the attack was coming on, of a “ disagreeable” feeling in the left breast, and, on the daj^ before his death, of an “ uneasiness’ in the chest. The laceration was supposed to have occurred when he was first attacked, and the open- ing into the pericardium at the time of death. (Med. Jour. Vol. lii. p. 418.) 1855. Dr. C. Ellis. 1769. A sixth specimen. — The laceration commences just above the valves, and extends an inch and a half upward, posteriorly, and through the inner and middle coats. Mid- dle and outer coats separated to the extent of about one- half of their circumference, and as far as 4 in. from the iliacs; portions of the middle coat being separated with; 23MORBID ANATOMY. 354 the outer, as shown in the next specimen.

Fell and died immediately. The pericardium was filled with blood; and a short dis- tance above the aortic valves, posteriorly, was a vertical laceration from two to three-eighths of an inch in length, extending through the middle coat, and separating this from the outer, around two-thirds of the circumference of the vessel, and upward to within an inch of the art. iunom- inata. The cellular tissue toward the lungs was also infil- trated with blood. Aorta dilated, and atheromatous. 1861. Dr. G. Ellis. 1772. An eighth case. — The patient was a clergyman, mt. fifty- • five, and a large powerful man, though not healthy. An attack of pain along the back came on, that was over- powering in its severity; but some relief was got from opiates and ether. At last, and for the first time, severe pain came on in the front of the chest, extending through from the back; an hour afterward he started up, groaned heavily, and fell back dead, not quite four days from the first attack of pain. The left pleural cavity contained about six pints of blood and serum ; and near the lung was a large, ragged opening through into the surrounding tissues. Just beyond the subclavian artery there is, as seen in the preparation, aMORBID ANATOMY. 355 raffeed laceration, more than an incli in length ; and from this point the blood had worked a passage for itself between the middle and outer coats of the aorta as far as the iliacs, into one of which it had burst through again into its proper channel. There was atheromatous disease of the artery ; and considerable hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart, though without valvular disease, or previous symp- toms. Here, again, the rupture of the aorta must have taken place when the pain came on, and that into the pleural cav- ity at the time of death. (Med. Jour. Vol. nxxn. p. 80.) 1865. Dr. C. Ellis. 1773. A ninth case. — From a patient of Dr. Minot; a man of • delicate health, and about forty years of age. He had been sick' for a week with very obscure constitutional symptoms, and died at last, suddenly. In the back part of the aorta is a longitudinal rupture of the internal and middle coats, and commencing from one- half to tkTee-fourths of an inch above the valves. The blood had forced its way between the middle and external coats as far as the right renal artery, where it re-entered the natural channel, as it had also in the thoracic aorta. There was also a rupture into the right auricle, by a slit au inch in length, as seen in the preparation. The heart was universally hypertrophied and dilated ; pericardium uni- versally adherent; and there was considerable atheroma- tous disease of the aorta. The hypertrophy of the heart, and disease of the arte- ries in this and in the last case were thought to sufficiently explain the rupture. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxii. p. 81.) 1865. Dr. C. Ellis. The coincidence in the occurrence of rare cases has been observed here as well as elsewhere ; but in none has it been more remarkable than in these of dissecting aneurism : Nos. 1765-6; 1769 and 1771; 1772-3, — these two last patients having died within less than four days of each other. 1774.

The patient was a woman, set. twenty-six. In May, 1861, she received a violent blow on the chest, aad shortly afterward had acute pain across the upper part of the chest and shoulders, with slight cough. In September she had a deep-seated “smarting” beneath the upper part of the sternum, with dyspnoea, hoarseness, and dysphagia. In May, 1862, a tumor appeared, and her disease progressed. In December (Hospital, 246, 146) a double pulsation was quite marked over the tumor; aneurismal bruit below the right clavicle, and over the carotid, but not in the tumor. Respiration loudest over right side ; and over the left it was somewhat bronchial. Occasional, hollow, hard, hoarse cough. April, 1863, she raised a few ounces of aerated blood, and died in about ten minutes. The left primary bronchus was much flattened, and closely adherent to the sac ; an opening having undoubt- edly taken place there, as blood was found in the bronchi upon both sides. The right lung was distended and healthy. The left pleura was adherent, except at the lower part where was a cavity containing about a pint of pus; and the lung was small, compressed, and contained numerous small purulent cavities. (Med.

Nine weeks before death a pulsating tumor appeared in the upper sternal region, and rapidly increased, so as to meas- ure before death in. transversely and 6| vertically. A distressing cough and frequent sense of suffocation were constant symptoms toward the last; and the slightest pres- sure upon the tumor caused severe cough and d}'spnoea. She, however, maintained herself, b}7 work, until the last six weeks ; but for the last two weeks was confined to her bed, and suffered much. On dissection, the tumor extended from just above the line of the second ribs to the lower edge of the larynx upon the right side, and from the anterior extremity of the sec- ond rib upon the left side to be3rond that upon the right. The aorta was dilated immediately above the valves, and the asc. portion and arch formed an immense sac. Pos- teriorly the vessel wras wrinkled and atheromatous ; and, anteriorly, the sac was formed by the eroded sternum and expanded pectoral muscles; the cavity containing much old and recent coagulum.

The larger one, as seen in the preparation, encroached upon the oesophagus, the inner surface of which was discolored. An additional portion of the aorta shows a third sac just above the valves, one-third of an inch or more in diameter, and of the true variety. The vessel itself is considerably dis- eased. From a gentleman, set. twenty-nine. Cough for seven or eight months, and urgent for the last three or four; not much expectoration. Some dyspnoea ; and about a month before his death spoke of pain in the region of the heart. He was considered, however, as a healthy man. Went to his room to smoke a cigar; and about two hours afterward was found dead. 1866. Dr. E. J. Bigeloiv. 1784. A poition of the aorta, showing a defined, rounded aneu- lism, 7 in. in length, and just above the diaphragm; ori- fices very defined. The sac seems to be formed, mainly, bjr a dilatation of the artery ; the inner surface of wdiich is much diseased, but not ossified. The aorta, otherwise, is moderately diseased, but of the natural size. Fiom a man, about fifty 3rears of age, who had had for more than two years pain in the lumbar region, became much emaciated, and died from a rupture of the sac into the left pleural cavity; this last containing about six quarts of blood.

The heart, with a large portion of the aorta distended, dried, and cut open, to show two aneurismal sacs. One of these last is situated at the passage of the artery through the diaphragm, defined and regular in its outline, and larger than the two fists. The other is about half as large, more irregular, situated just above the first, and connected with it. The openings from the aorta are quite abrupt, but not large ; and between the two sacs is a larger and very de- fined opening. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1786. Aneurism of the aorta where it passes through the dia- phragm ; of the size of two fists.

A similar plastering-up, as he would call it, is shown by Curveilhier. (.Anat. Path. liv. xxyiii. pi. 3.) From the lower part of the sac the coeliac artery arises; but at its very origin there is a linear obliteration, and so complete that no trace of it was seen upon the inner sur- face of the sac. A portion of the vessel is preserved, and shows that it was smaller than usual. The sup. mesenteric artery also arises just within the sac, and is very much contracted at its origin, as if undergoing obliteration. Directly by the side of this aneurism was another, as large or larger than the two fists, and that burst into the left pleural cavity. The patient, a negro, set. thirty-three years, and a strong laboring man, entered the hospital (275, 118), with obscure pains over the abdomen, that he had had for two weeks; having, previously, been quite well. A few days afterward there came on an effusion into the left pleural cavity, the result of a verjr moderate amount of inflamma- tion ; and about three weeks after admission he died almost instantly. There had been pulsation in the left epigastric region, and his chief complaint was of the left hypochon- drium ; but aneurism had not been suspected. A large amount of blood was, of course, found in the chest. 1868. Dr. J. Homans, Jr. A complete and linear obliteration of a large artery, wheie it arises from an aneurismal sac, X have met Avith three times (Med. Jour.

A strongly pulsating tumor was then first felt in the abdomen, continued ever afterward, and was re- garded as an aneurism by his brotherf who was a physi- cian ; but he never had the slightest trouble from it, ex- cepting a pain in the corresponding part of the back. Death occurred in about an hour and a half after a rupture of the sac into the general cellular tissue ; this last being attended with severe pain and great pallor, though the amount of effused blood was small. 1861.

A second cast taken March 20th. 1857. Dr. J. M. Warren. 1796. Cast in plaster, by Mr. G., showing the tumor in a case of subclavian aneurism. The patient was a man, set. twrenty-eight, who, four months before entrance into the hospital, on the 15th of August (264, 134), fell down a hatchway. Ten weeks be- fore entrance a tumor appeared behind the right clavicle. After lifting a heavy weight pain came on ; and this, with the tumor, increased from that time. On admission, the tumor was of the size of a goose-egg, and pulsating; with a marked systolic souffle and a distinct aneurismal thrill. Pain pretty constant, quite severe, and extending down the arm, and into the chest. Arm somewhat swollen, and radial pulse very faint. On the 26th the tumor was gently kneaded, with a view of breaking up the contents ; pres- sure was afterward applied, and the patient was kept upon the lowest diet. Under this treatment the tumor di- minished somewhat in size; but on the 15th of Sept, two ulcers had formed under the apparatus that had been ap- plied. On the 17th a small slough appeared, and on the 20th he left the hospital. The whole limb subsequently gangrened, and he died within a few weeks after his dis- charge. The cast was taken by Mr. J. O. Green, one of the house-pupils. 1866. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1797. Aneurism of the left subclavian artery. From a woman, set. thirty-five. (Hospital, 75, 118.) There had been some numbness of the extremity for eleven months; and a tumor, which was 3 in. in diameter, had ex- isted for seven months. Operation by Dr. B. The artery was dilated just outside the scalenus ; and, to get at the sound part, one-third or more of this muscle was divided, and one-half of the mastoid. Instead of tying the ligature, a string of beads was run down upon it, so that the pressure365 MORBID ANATOMY. might be graduated. Pulsation returned in twenty-four hours, hut the patient died four days after the operation from a rupture of the artery at the point of the ligature. The sac is 4 or 5 inches in length, 1 or 2 in diameter, and was fdled with recent coagulum. There was also a firm, rounded, and older coagulum, as seen in the prepara- tion, toward the distal extremit}'- of the sac, and resulting, it was thought, from the distal circulation. The ligature has been left about the vessel; and the rupture of the ves- sel is seen. 1857. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1798. Thibert’s model; aneurism at the elbow. 1847. Dr. Geo. Ilayivard. 1799. An abscess between the oesophagus and left subclavian artery, and opening into each. From a man, about thirty-five years of age, who, whilst eating his dinner, Nov. 13th, was seized with a sense of constriction in the oesophagus, at about the level of the up- per edge of the sternum ; and, though not conscious of having swallowed any hard substance, he was convinced that something was lodged in his throat. Probangs were passed with perfect ease, and again on the following dav, with a sense of relief. On the 22d copious hemorrhage came on from the stomach and bowels, with faintness and great prostration ; and, after having recurred a number of times, he died on the afternoon of the 24th. From the 14th he complained much of numbness, and loss of power in the left arm, and especially of the two middle fingers. The abscess was 2 in. in length, with dark, loose, offen- sive walls; and contained, besides an offensive fluid of the same color, a shaving of wood, about three lines in length, one in breadth, and exceedingly thin. The opening into the oesophagus was J in. in length, and £ in. below the lower edge of the thyroid ; the one into the artery being two lines in diameter, and about an inch from the aorta. Ihe abscess and the openings from it are marked by colored glass rods. Dr. L. was quite sure that there had never been a bone in the throat, and could not account for the bit of wood that was found. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxiii. p.403.) 1868. Dr. G. II. Lyman.366 MORBID ANATOMY. 1800. Cast in plaster, showing the external appearances in a case of circumscribed, traumatic aneurism just below the elbow. The patient, who was forty-one years of age, and always healthy, was shovelling coal, when a large lump fell from his shovel as he was in the act of lifting it. Severe pain at the elbow instantly followed, obliging him to quit work; preventing sleep, and followed in ten days by swelling and discoloration. When this last subsided, at the end of three weeks, a tumor was discovered, as large as a small egg. On admission into the hospital (122, 74), Oct. 25th, and seven weeks after the accident, it was as large as a man’s fist, and slowly increasing; the transverse diameter being double that of the longitudinal. It was elastic, but not fluctuating, sensitive, nor movable; pulsating feebly, and only on its inner side, with an aneurismal thrill, when ex- amined with the stethoscope ; not compressible, and not modified by compression of the artery above, except as to pulsation. There was no pulsation at the wrist, and the hand was sublivid, cold, and numb. On the 28th the _ tumor, was exposed by an incision, and was found to con- sist wholly of recent coagula, contained within a circum- scribed sac. These were turned out; and the artery, which lay superficially upon the tumor, was tied above and below an oval opening which involved about one-half the calibre of the vessel, as though a transverse rupture had occurred, the edges of which had subsequently separated. A small fibrinous clot protruded from each end of the artery at its point of rupture. The collateral circulation being in part established, there was a little bleeding from the sac of t ie aneurism; but, otherwise, no blood was lost. - ov. t the wound was granulating finely, and the ligatures came away, though pulsation had not returned at the wrist; and on the 12th he left the hospital. 1866.

The patient, a weigher and gauger, forty-nine \eais o aae and a brother of Dr. O., was thrown from a wagon about the month of June, 1861, struck his left knee, and was laid up for two days. To this accident he always re-3G7 MOKBID ANATOMY. ferred his disease, though he was quite well until Oct., 18G5, when he first had pain in the left popliteal region. Early in Dec. a pulsating tumor was found there, about the size of a hen’s egg; and by the end of the month it had increased to the size of a fist. About the first of Jan., Dr. O. commenced a system of compression of the femoral artery, and it was continued until the 20th of May, when all pulsation had ceased in the tumor. The compression was never entirely stopped but once, and then he suffered severely. The tumor, which seemed to be distended almost to bursting, began to subside in April, and did not exist in any marked degree during the last year, though the popliteal space remained filled out and the knee bent. Different means were used, but Dr. O. thought that digital compression, which was used during the last three weeks, v as decidedly the best. Pain in .the ham and down to the foot was very considerable before compression was used, and much more severe afterward, so that opiates were re- quired ; but there was none in the ham after the pulsation ceased, though it continued in the foot. There was swell- ing of the foot soon after the treatment was commenced, and it continued till Sept. In April, sloughing of the foot came on, but this at last did well. The patient was reduced from one hundred and forty to ninety pounds ; lost a great deal ol strength, and kept his bed until Sept., 1866, when he was able to get about on crutches ; and even during the last year he was obliged to use a crutch and a cane. In Jan., 1868, he died of pneumonia. In the preparation the sac is seen of a regular, elongated form, about 5J in. in length and 2£ in. in diameter, and completely filled with decolorized, and rather crumbling fibrine. The femoral artery is somewhat diseased, and to the extent of about l£ in. above the sac there is complete obliteration. At the lower extremity of the sac, and with- in the cavity, some pus was found at the time of the dis- section ; there having been great pain in the part for three weeks before the pneumonia began. 1868. lorui fnr , ®r- John P- Orclioay. 180i.

They involve, generally, a portion only of the circumference; and, to some extent, the sacs were situated regularly along one side of the vessel.

A cast in plastm of the hand and greater part of the upper extremity, from a case of varicose aneurism. The patient, a girl, set. nineteen, entered the hospital (76 54) Oct. 21st, 1857. When two years old the palm of the hand was injured by a stone, and very shortly after- ward a small pulsating tumor appeared there. About five years before entrance, and when first seen at the hospital, a laro-e tumor seemed to be held in and to fill the palm of the hand ; firm at some points, and soft and pulsating in others, with a strong aneurismal thrill on compression ; the blood seeming, in some parts, to be contained in large aneurismal sacs, and in others in arteries as large as the carotid. There was also quite a firm tumor along the whole front of the forearm, under the muscles, but without pulsation. Amputation was advised, but refused; and a cast of the hand and forearm that is m the Med. Soc. s Cabinet (No. 1425) was then taken. When seen the sec- ond time, the tumor in the palm and forearm had more than doubled in size, with a distinct aneurismal thrill along the brachial artery, a highly varicose state of the surrounc ing veins, and a sound like that of machinery m the palm The arm was quite unwieldy, very painful at times, and the disease was rapidly increasing; the cast here shown being taken at this time. Amputation was performed N ov. 7th,'about the middle of the arm, and nearly twenty ves- sels were tied ; it being soon found that the veins carried arterial blood ; a tourniquet, however, being applied quite hicrh up and very tightly, an extremely small quantity of blood was lost. After a long convalescence the patient was discharged well, Dec. 24th, 1857 ; there never having been any hemorrhage nor any evidence of remaining eiec ile tissue. (See nest specimen.) «». ,. * Wm 1812 The limb (see last specimen) was injected by Dr. II. J- Bigelow; the «* having been thrown in by the vents and returned by the arteries; and it was then dissected a prepared by Dr. R. M. Hodges. The muscles had disap-MORBID ANATOMY. 371 peared, and nothing remained but the blood-vessels and a very dense fibro-cellular tissue. The whole of this last, however, was removed with very great care and skill, and the preparation now consists of the bones of the extremity and of the vessels only. The vessels are placed in their proper relation to each other and to the bones, which last are surrounded by the veins, as in a piece of basket-work; and the large and free communication between the arteries and veins is well shown upon the back of the hand and near the first metacarpal bone. The arteries and veins, gener- ally , are only moderately enlarged ; but, where they” com- municate, they are considerably so, though only for a short distance. Dr. Bigelow imported Brescliet’s Memoir on Aneurisms (Paris, 1834), with reference to this case, and found that it would correspond to his “ Varix arterielle; ” the com- munication with the vein being a complication. 1858. iqi9 mi *, Dr. J.

The tumor was of the size of a lS-o-e hen’s egg directly over the right eye, projecting upon the fore- head and dipping beneath the orbit; surface convoluted, of a brilliant red, pulsating heavily, and filling to its ut- most capacity in about three seconds after the blood had een pressed out of it as from a sponge. It was painless, of about twenty years’ duration, gradually increasing, and ongmally near the hair, from which situation it seemed to gravitated to its present position. Numerous dilated ai teiies radiated from its circumference. At the operation, the arger trunks were secured by ligature, but the tumor continued to fil with blood until nearly the whole periphery d been included in successive ligatures. With a view to is ladical extirpation, it was then rapidly excised within he ligatures, when the exposed surface bled obstinately and even after the use of the actual cautery.

The vena cava was filled throughout with fibrine or more recent coagulum ; and also the femoral veins, as far as they were examined, to the middle of the thigh. Along the course of the vessels, and apparently external to them, were three or four abscesses. From a man, aet. forty, who entered the hospital (66, 8) July 30th, with a severe wound of the elbow, followed by delirium tremens. Aug. 19th, active constitutional symp- toms came on, and he died on the 25th of Sept. There was great swelling from the first, and pitting on pressure,MORBID ANATOMY. 374 but with scarcely ever any tenderness along the veins. 1856. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1830. The upper vena cava and its great branches dissected out and showing the effects of former phlebitis ; the following appearances being noted in the recent state. Vena cava, very nearly from its termination in the heart, vena innomi- nata, and left subclavian filled with a soft, pultaceous fibrine. Left jugular, to the extent of J an inch, reduced to a cord £ of an inch in diameter, and filled with whitish, crumbling fibrine. The common trunk of the right jugular and subclavian was reduced to a cord J of an inch in diam- eter, and filled with dense fibrine. The right subclavian, to the extent of § of an inch from its origin, was more dis- eased than any other part, and so completely atrophied that it was with difficulty found, but the cavity was at last traced and laid open. Beyond these parts there was in the vessels coagulated blood and fibrine. Two veins upon the right side of the neck were most remarkably adherent to some extent by the inner surface, and formed a thick flat band, but without a trace of fibrine within. The fibrine had in several places more or less of an ochre-3 elloiv coloi ; but it could generally be separated from the inner suiface of the vessels, and left this last with its natural polish. The parietes of the veins were generally thick and opaque, and blended with the surrounding cellular tissue, where they were reduced to a cord. The vena azygos is seen cut off just at its termination in the great vein, and of full size, though a portion of fibrine lies loosely across its ori- fice. There was also recent coagulum and fibrine in the rio-ht ext. iliac vein and fibrinous deposits upon the inner surface of both auricles of the heart. From a woman, set. thirty-nine, who died at the hospital (133, 131), of general tuberculosis, after about a years sickness; phlebitis having never been thought of. Theie was .considerable oedema of the face and all four of the extremities ; but this may have been owing to Bright s dis- ease, which was well marked. 1849. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 1831.

Cast, m plaster, of a lower extremity, in which the lymphatics and the veins were enlarged. From a man, mt. twenty-two, who entered the hospital (o ,16) Feb. 5th, 1853. For twelve years he had had swelling of the limb, with varicose veins, and. frequent at- ac cs of inflammation. Four and a half years before, he egan to have an oozing of a milky-looking fluid from the skin, over the lower part of the leg. This last continued lor a few days, with subsidence of the swelling, and during the following year it recurred every few weeks, but never afterward. Three years before entrance the inguinal glands egan to be mucb swollen during the acute attacks, withMORBID ANATOMY. 376 discharge from the popliteal space, which last continued from that time at intervals, and was increasing. The last acute attack was a year before; and he had kept his bed from that time. On admission, the discharge amounted in three or four days to a pint, and was found to be coagulable. The limb was very much enlarged, flabby, and shrivelled about the knee, and covered with perspiration that had a sweetish odor; temperature considerably increased; lower two- thirds copper-colored. On several parts were clusters of bullae that were but little elevated, and had a deep cavity beneath, so that they could be inverted ; reappearing slowly when pressure was removed, and discharging a milky fluid when pricked. The discharge oozed guttatim, from a discolored spot on the ham a few lines in diameter; the surface of the skin not being indurated, elevated, nor bro- ken. The inguinal glands were considerably enlarged, and the knee anchylosed. As to his general condition, the man looked bright, and reported himself as quite well, excepting the limb. In a few days spots appeared like those of erythema nodosum, and continued for some time ; and in July red lines along the thigh were noted. In De- cember, the thigh being very stiff, the adhesions were broken down; and he afterward exercised more freely about .the wards. In June, 1854, he left the hospital, and in April, 1855, he returned ; having had, meanwhile, about a dozen discharges from the limb. On the 19th of May the thigh was amputated at the upper third. The hemorrhage from the enlarged veins was so great that several of them were tied, and the patient died on the 31st, with tetanic sjmp- toms. On dissection, the whole limb was very OBdematous ; and enlarged lymphatics were seen, as before death, and espe- cially upon the inner and posterior surfaces, and about the popliteal space. The bullae, above referred to, marked the points where the lymph was confined, only by a thin, trans- parent cuticle, the rupture of which exposed its interior to the depth of a fourth of an inch in some cases. These cavities communicated with adjoining and similar ones by minute orifices in a dense and fibrous tissue, and theseMORBID ANATOMY. 377 again communicated with others ; the whole forming a cav- ernous tissue like some old erectile tumor; the disease here being probably of the oldest date. The deeper lym- phatics, and chiefly along the blood-vessels, were also di- lated, and very regularly tortuous. The superficial veins were extensively varicose ; and also, and to a very marked degree, the deep venae comites (Nos. 1821-2). There was no inflammation of the limb, nor any other disease found after death. (See the four next specimens.) 1856. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 1836.

A specimen that was formerly in spirit, and then described as a heavy, defined, subcutaneous mass, of the consistence of hardened putty, but without any distinctly earthy de- posit, 3f in. in length, by nearly 2 in. in diameter; and looking like the result of some former tubercular disease. Having been dried, it was described by Dr. J. Bacon as organic in its composition. Dry and hard, but rather fria- ble, and having a granular appearance. Color, dull grayish- white. Burned with the odor of burning ham, and left a minute white residue. A little phosphate of lime, after treatment with hydrochloric acid. In hot nitric acid it assumed a lemon-yellow color, and gas was evolved. No appreciable amount of fatty matter shown by ether. The chemical reactions were those of fibrine, or some proteine compound. Microscopically, it was seen to be wholly com- posed of nucleated cells, arranged in regular layers, in the manner of pavement epithelium. The cells were more or less distorted, probably from drying, but appeared to be epithelial in their character. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1856.

The tumor had existed for a year, and grown very rapidly the last month ; without any tendency to soften, but beginning to cause dyspnoea by pressure upon the nerves and trachea. It was as large as the two fists; extending from the ear to be- neath the clavicle, and from the median line to the trape- zius. Lobulated, movable, and feeling like a chain of glands ; skin not adherent. It was found to be situated mainly beneath, and partly behind, the mastoid muscle ; and every where very strongly adherent. Microscopical^, it was composed of uniform380 MORBID ANATOMY. cells, about two-thirds the size of the blood corpuscle, and filled with from four to six granular nuclei. There were a few spindle-shaped fibrous cells; but no larger cells, nor evidence of any malignant disease. The boy recovered well, and it was thought that the dis- ease would not return. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxviii. p. 259.) Eight months after the operation, however, the disease did return, and at the end of a year the tumor was two-thirds as large as before. Other glands were enlarged, with a failure of the general health, and the patient probably soon died. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxii. p. 20.) 1863. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 1858-9.

Always quite healthy until a severe burn on the chest a year and a half before. Soon after recovery a tumor appeared just below the left ear, and steadily increased. He was anaemic, with two or three “ scrofulous sores” on the head, and two irregularly lobu- lated, and quite movable tumors in the neck, — one just below the ear, and the other just above the clavicle. Spleen somewhat enlarged, and easily felt. Number of white corpuscles in the blood very little if at all increased. At the time of removal the glands were found in large num- bers, extending in all directions, and even beneath the sternum ; from the size of a pea to that of a pigeon’s egg ; and a few were left, as, from the loss of blood, and the pa- tient s condition, it was not thought safe to prolong the operation. On the 26th the wound had nearly healed, and the boy left the hospital. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 1862-3. Ambrotypos of the above case. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow.381 MORBID ANATOMY. SERIES XXIII. —NERVOUS SYSTEM. I. Brain. 1864. A portion of the brain, showing the effects of a gun-shot injury. From a soldier, who was wounded Aug. 30th. For the first three days he was about the wards during a part of the time, perfectly conscious, with a good appetite, and with- out pain ; and insisted that a ball had not entered his head. Sept. 3d he was found comatose, and on the morning of the 5th he died. A defined fracture of the frontal bone was found half an inch above the centre of the right supra-orbital ridge ; and in the brain, where the ball entered, an abscess of the size of a walnut, with bits of bone. The ball had evidently traversed the whole length of the lateral ventricle, and en- tered the posterior hemisphere, from which last it dropped when the brain was removed. The parietes of the ventri- cle were considerably abraded, and infiltrated with pus, as was the brain along the track of the ball. It was sup- posed that the ball penetrated no deeper than the anterior portion of the brain at first, but that it subsequently grav- itated to where it was at last found. 1863. Dr. Francis H. Brown. The following nine models by Thibert were presented in 1849. Dr. John Ware. 1865. Brain congested, with small drops of blood upon the cut surface. 1866.

A defined, chronic abscess in the posterior portion of the brain. The patient, a lad, thirteen years of age, entered the hospital Sept. 18th, 1843 (27, 132). In May, of the same year, he had “ typhoid fever,” and headache from that time; pain mostly in the forehead, and not severe until the last of June. In June there was dimness of vision, and ever afterward. From July 10th till Aug. 9th he was in the country, and able to play about somewhat. About the middle of July he was struck upon the back of the head by an andiron. The accident was a slight one, but in about a week a swelling appeared over the occiput, and on the 13th of September it was opened and dis- charged slightly. During the last three or four weeks he had daily attacks of general tremulousness, with much ex- citement, and commencing with pain in the back of the neck. Never any loss of consciousness, convulsions, or paralysis. Stomach sufficiently well. Death almost in- stantaneous the morning after his entrance into the hos- pital. The abscess is in the very posterior part of the l<?ft hem- isphere of the brain, of a regular circular form, and con- tained § iv. of healthy-looking pus. A sort of cyst, that lined the cavity, is most remarkably distinct, and was readily separable from the surrounding parts ; about half a line in thickness, moderately firm, not fibrous, not generally opaque, a little reddened in some parts, without any trace of lymph, and somewhat resembling a mucous surface, as Lallemand remarked that it ma3r be in such cases after some years. The cerebral substance, anteriorly, was somewhat gelatiniforra, and in some parts, just around the abscess, it was very soft and disorganized. The brain, generally,883 MORBID ANATOMY. was swollen and rather firm. ' Ventricles large; with serous effusion; membranes remarkably free from mois- ture ; strongly adherent to dura mater,' over the abscess, to the extent of about lines, with a direct opening through the bone (No. 1279), between the abscess within and the one external to the bone. 1847.

The patient, rnt. sixty-five, received a severe blow upon the back of the head and neck, in July, 1857, and had pain from that time. July 14th, 1858, he entered the hospital (217, 188), with his memory much impaired, but having never had paralysis nor anything like an apoplectic attack. His health had been rapidly failing for the last few weeks, and he died comatose, July 26th. The cysts, which extended nearly from the longitudinal sinus to the base of the brain, were thick, firm, and opaque. One upou the right side contained about two ounces of thin blood, and soft, blackish coagula, with some yellowish fibrine adhering to the inner surfaces. Within about an inch of the periphery, and all around, the two walls united, and then, as a single layer, became thinner until they were gradually lost in the dura mater. Upon the left side, the walls of the cavity seemed to have been in contact. Both hemispheres were flattened beneath the cysts, which ad- hered very slightly, if at all, to the arachnoid, but pretty firmly to the dura mater. The brain was healthy.384 morbid anatomy.

From a patient of Mr. B. ; and the following facts in the case were obtained by him, chiefly from the mother, but partly from his own observation. “ Tlie child, a female, was three years old, to within a month, at the time of its death, which was occasioned by a slight diarrhoea of a week’s duration. The head was about twice the natural size at birth, and the anterior fontanelle very large ; the enlargement increasing gradually, so that about a week before death it measured in its greatest cir- cumference 27f inches. It was never able to sit up and support the head, nor even to turn it from the left side, upon which it always lay. It never spoke, and seemed to have no intelligence. The vision was alwaj^s very imper- fect, and occasionally quite lost; and there was also a slight stiabismus from birth. For a time there was slight deafness, but this increased, so that it could only hear when the mother spoke in a very loud tone of voice. It slept generally not more than one and a half in twenty-four hours; and was very restless, moaning much of the time, as from distress, and requiring a free use of opiates, but not crying out as from sharp pain. Never convulsed. Faeces generally passed involuntarily, and sometimes the urine. In regard to its general health, it was feeble, thin, and pale, but sufllciently warm ; nursed its mother heartily until the time of its death, and took cow’s milk, but never any solid food. “ On examination, which Mr. B. made alone, he found the cranial cavity filled with serum, and the cerebellum sufficiently natural in appearance; but of the cerebrum he found very little remains. “ The specimen, which is an uncommonly fine one, and was very finely prepared by Mr. B., shows all the charac- teristics of a I13 drocephalic skull, — the great dispropor- tion between the facial portion and the vault of the cranium, — the thinness of this last and the great deficiency of bone in place of the anterior fontanelle, — the disappearance of the supra-orbital ridge, and the numerous Wormian bones, one of which is of large size. Sutures deeply serrated. 25386 MORBID ANATOMY. The greatest circumference is 27 in.; and from one audi- tory meatus to the other, over the top of the head, and allowing for the deficiency at the anterior fontanelle, it measures 20J in. Internal capacity 257 cubic inches.” 1866. Mr. Walter C. Blaisdell, vied, student. 1889. A third specimen, with the following history of the case by Dr. S.: “ It was the cranium of a girl born in this city. Becom- ing an orphan at a very early age, she was admitted to the House of Industry, where she was instructed in the usual branches of knowledge taught in our common schools, until at length, such was her capacity, she was entrusted with the teaching of the other pauper children. She was of excellent character for intelligence and moral worth, and gave much satisfaction to the officers of the House. Being fitted, as was thought by the Directors, to earn her own support, she was discharged from the House, and found employment in a private family in the city. Here, from exposure incident to her situation, she contracted a cough. A decline soon followed, and she was compelled to return to the House, where at last she died of consumption, at the age of sixteen. “ The skull measures 24£ in. in its circumference, and over the head, from one auditory meatus to the other, 17£ in. There is nowhere any deficiency of bone, and yet it is in no place more than £of an inch in thickness. Its great- est diameter is from the centre of one parietal bone to the other, but presents no unseemly deformity. “ On examination after death, tbe brain was found float- ing, as it were, in a large collection of water, throughout which many patches of lymph apparently were diffused. “ She died peacefully, and retained her consciousness as long as she was able to respire.” Internal capacity 176 cubic inches. 1866. Dr. Charles H. Stedman. 1890. A fourth specimen; bones of the vault separated, and imperfectly developed. The head was very large, and felt like a loose bag; the fluid being in the lateral ventricles, which formed one enormous cavity.

From a man, who was an exhibitor of wild animals. At about the age of two years the top of his head was severely burned, and bone came away, leaving an opening about an inch in diameter. From that time there was a constant discharge until about seven years before his death, when a grizzly bear tore his scalp down over his eyes. His head then healed, and continued so until two years before death, when a “ man-monkey ” clawed, bit, and tore it open again. The epithelial disease then appeared, rose an inch above the surrounding surface, and looked like the crest of a fowl; the extent being 4 by 3£ in. Pain, hemorrhage, con- vulsions, and at last hemiplegia were the consequences. The bone was extensively destroyed (No. 1525) ; and an abscess was found in the brain beneath the seat of the disease.

A portion of the lower jaw, removed from the articulation to about one-fourth of an inch beyond the angle, in a case of very intense neuralgia. The patient was a man, thirty-two years of age, who had suffeied the greatest agony from the disease, for twelve 01 thiiteen years. About the year 1860 the infra-orbital and one other nerve of the face were divided. In 1861 and again in 1863 a portion of the lower jaw and of the nerve were removed at the hospital; and in 1864 the facial nerve was freely divided. June 24th, 1869, he again en- tered the hospital (140, 183). On the 30th the bone was removed; and the nerve, as nearly as possible, to its exit, from the base of the skull; the hemorrhage being very co- pious. There was a loss of motion and sensibilitv in the side of the face ; and on the 3d of July, and again on the 4th, there was a return of very severe pain. There was no more, however, after this last date, and on the 13th he was discharged. The surface of the bone is somewhat irregular, but healthy, and the opening that resulted from the former operations is about $ by | in. Dec. 9th, the man reports no pain since operation, but face continues paralyzed. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1909. Neuromatous tumors about a stump. The patient was a young man, eighteen years of age, who had his arm amputated when he was nine years old. For the first two years he had a good stump, and then the bone began to project. On admission into the hospital (115, 54), the integument was thin, and shining over it to the extent of an inch, but the cicatrix was not involved. There was severe pain, and the tumors were easily felt. Two inches and a half of the bone were removed, with a part of the integument, — the bone tapering to a point. All of the nerves terminated in large bulbous tumors ; and a bursa over the end of the bone contained a great number of minute loose bodies. The relief was perfect. Di. H. regarded this, not as a common conical stump, but as a case in wrhich the bone grew with the lad’s growth ;390 MORBID ANATOMY. and he referred to several such cases in-his work on Excision of the Joints. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxx. p. 499.) 1864. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 1910-11. A neuralgic stump. Aug. 24th, 1867, the patient fractured his arm and fore- arm, and amputation was performed below the elbow. Nov. 10th he entered the hospital (134, 84), with pain shooting up from the stump, anteriorly and posteriorly; and on the 7th of Dec. a second amputation was performed at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the hume- rus. The wound suppurated ; and on tbe 28th of January, when it had nearly or quite healed, he reported that he had had for some days a deep-seated pain in the middle of the humerus, which was the seat of the fracture. This pain continued to be so severe, that on the 22d of Feb. a third amputation was performed at the upper part of the bone ; and the musculo-spiral nerve was found caught between the fragments of the broken bone, so that it could not be withdrawn, as shown in the second specimen. Both speci- mens are preserved in spirit, and show the connection of the nerves with the cicatrix below the elbow, and with the fractured humerus. 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow.

M. Warren received from old Dr. Souberbielle, of P., a history of this case; and, having translated the manuscript, it was published for the first time in the American Jour, of Med. Sciences, Jan. 1851. The patient was eighty-two years of age ; the horn had been growing for six years, and was readily removed by Dr. S. A small one is seen upon one of the cheeks ; and she had formerly had one removed from the hand. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 1996. Cast, in plaster, of a horn that grew from just above the eyebrow of an old woman, ninety-two years of age, and that was of six years’ duration. The form was conical, and the extremity curved downward ; length, along its convex- ity i °i Base soft, and bulging; the circumference being 4|- in. The rest of the growth was hard to the feel, fibrous in appearance, and grooved upon the surface. Sev- eral similar growths existed upon different parts of the face, elsewhere, but none of them projected more than a line or two ; two of these are shown upon the cast. A few398 MORBID ANATOMY. months after this last was taken, the inflammation that pre- viously existed about the growth, increased; and, after poulticing it for some weeks, the dense portion was thrown off. (See next specimen.) Ulceration of the base fol- lowed ; and, at the end of a year from the time when the patient was first seen, it had extended over a large portion of the forehead, and had all the appearance of an epithelial cancer. The grandmother of this patient was said to have had a cutaneous horn in the same position as in the above case, and that terminated in cancer. The above history is from a detailed account, with a figure of the case, by Dr. D. in the Med. Jour. Vol. lxxiv. p. 9. 1866. Dr. Silas DurTcee. 1997. The horn above described. 1866. Dr. li. L. Hoclgdon, of W. Cambridge. 1998. Horn removed from a cicatrix. From a man, thirty years of age, who had had both of his hands amputated through the metacarpal bones when he was six years old. At the age of twenty-five years the horn began to grow from one of the stumps; and, as the man thought, from the irritation of a strap that he wore. About a year before his admission into the hospital, on the 11th of August (140, 232), the horn was removed; its dimensions being then 3 in. or more by 1 in. In four or five months it reappeared; and, when seen by Dr. H., it was about 2 in. in height, 1£ in. transversely at the base, £ in. at the apex, and curving towards the radial edge of the hand. The cicatricial tissue over both stumps was very tense; and at the base of the horn it was inflamed, and occasionally ulcerated. After the horn was removed, the investing membrane was dissected off from the stump, the ends of the metacarpal bones were sawed off, and the man left the hospital on the 26th. For some years before the formation of the horn this man had supported himself as a clerk, and held his pen between the two stumps as he wrote. Since the above was in type, a note has been received from the patient, dated Dec. 28th, and saying that the horn has once more returned. The note was written in a399 MORBID ANATOMY. flowing, flourishing hand, and was accompanied with speci- mens of his writing, which will be preserved in the mu- seum. “A more formal handwriting it takes him much longer to write.” 1869. Dr. A. M. Hodges. 1999. A horn, removed by Dr. C. from near the chin of a half- witted lad, nineteen years of age. Duration of the growth eight years. The following description was given of it by Dr. Ii. J. Bigelow: — “ The growth is a blunt cone, 2 in. long, by an inch and a half at the base, and split into two parts, with a third smaller division at the root. It is roughly striated, length- wise, hard at the point, and softer at its insertion, emitting also the foetor of epidermic secretion. “ On section, a limited, epidermic, columnar structure is seen sprouting from a dense fibrous tissue beneath the base. The structure is irregular, and broken at intervals, but is harder and drier as it approaches the surface and summit. Microscopically, the whole is a mass of epidermic scales and nuclei, originally arranged in papillary form, of the piobable growth of which the following will give an idea. A central body of nuclei in each papilla grows out from the skin, its top .and sides developed into concentric scales, by which it is, as it were, shingled and slated. This outer layer is raised by another beneath, which in its turn is ele- vated by a third, so that the section of a papilla resembles a pile of inverted cups, of which the centre is occupied by nuclei, and the sides by more developed scales. “ Drynig as it grows, the hardened extremity of this so- called ‘horn’ consists almost wholly of epidermic plates, while the interior of its soft base is filled with papillary &iowth, containing nuclei. At the line of insertion of the w ole mass, nuclei are abundant, entangled in fibrous tis- sue. his epidermic structure has some affinity to that of °in, i'1 its papillae and columnar arrangement more resembles epitheloid cancer, without the globes character- istic of that growth.” 1862. Hr. H. O. Clark. 2000. A horn, removed from the prolabium of the lower lip ; it400 MORBID ANATOMY. is about 1 in. in length, and £ of an inch in diameter; and by its side is a second, about as long. The patient was a man, thirty-one years of age. Dura- tion of the disease nine years. At the end of three years it had reached its present size, and was removed for the first time. The rest of the lip was healthy. (Hospital, 116, 18.) An aunt of the patient had had a horn removed from her side ; and Dr. II. remarked upon the fact, as adding con- firmation to the relation between horns and epithelial can- cer, as has been pointed out by Mr. Paget. 1864. Dr. 11. M. Hodges. 2001. Cast of a leg affected with elephantiasis; taken after death. The limb, removed at the knee-joint, weighed fifty- two pounds, after losing much of the serum, with which it was infiltrated. At the largest part it measures 16\ in. transversely ; but just above the ankle, and also below the knee, it very suddenly diminished, and the foot is of the natural size; not much extension above the knee, —the greater part of the mass by far being upon the back of the leg. The surface, to a large extent, was rough from the collection of sebaceous matter or epidermis, cracked, in some parts excoriated, discolored, and brawny to the feel. The skin gradually became very greatly thickened, but blended with the immense amount of fibrous tissue that mainly constituted the mass. Upon the outer ankle is a similar little mass about the size of a nutmeg and very de- fined. The microscope showed a fibrous structure, and nothing more. Muscles separated from it, apparently, by a layer of adipose tissue; and blood-vessels seen in all parts. The patient was a man, about forty-seven years of age, who died in the spring of 1867 ; a Virginian by birth, but a resident of this State from childhood. When six years old he injured his foot; swelling of the leg came on at once, with a shooting pain in the limb, and the disease pro- gressed from that time. At the age of thirteen he went on a whaling voyage; and the leg that had before been smooth became rough, tubcrculated, and cracked, with a serous discharge, which continued more or less abundantMORBID ANATOMY. 401 so long as he lived. At the age of twenty-one he entered the hospital (24, 93) to have the limb removed; and a cast of it was taken at that time, which is now in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet (No. 415) ; the greatest circumference then being 28 in. For many years he was subject to violent at- tacks of fever, with severe pain in the limb, though it gen- erally troubled him only by its weight. He had also been subject to severe headache, hemorrhage from the bowels, derangement of the digestive organs, pulmonary symptoms, and for two years to dyspnoea, which last seemed to wear him out; there being found, on dissection, disease of the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. 1867.

There were four dusky red spots, from 4 in. to 2 in. in diameter ; and dui- ker the last two years they had increased in size, and be- come so sore that he was obliged to hold his dress off when walking. They were hard to the feel and very tender ; and at one spot they were so, without discoloration. Ice and salt were applied to produce cold ; but the part was frozen. Free subcutaneous incisions were afterwards made, and the patient was discharged March 20th, very much relieved, though the discoloration remained the same. Cast taken bv Mr Wm. N.

Disease of nine years’ duration. One of the patches extended across the upper front of the sternum, and measured 3 by 2 in. The other, over the lower extrem- ity of the bone, was more prominent, and an inch in diam- eter. This last was excised by Dr. C., after the cast was taken; and was found by Dr. Benj. S.

One scald healed well. The other suppurated freely, was frequently touched with lunar caustic, and finally healed. The cicatrix, how- ex ei, afterward enlarged, and became exceedingly painful, — the pain darting up and down the arm, and feeling as if a knife were thrust into it. About £ an inch above it another patch of cheloides appeared, and the two enlarged to- gether. After the operation the pain was quite relieved, and at the end of a year the disease had not returned. 1847, Dr. J. M. Warren. 2017.

Pain through the organ, with redness and soreness from the first; vision gradually affected, and none for the last six months. Swelling began six months before ; and when Dr. B. saw him there was a disorganized mass, of the size of a small apple, red, firm, and covered at the lower part by the everted conjunctiva. Aftei lemoval the mass had an ovoid form, was some- what knobbed upon the surface, and measured upon incis- ion, anteio-posteriorly, a trifle over lj£ in., and. transversely 1^ in. The outline of the globe upon this surface was distinct throughout, had somewhat the form of a chestnut, and was completely filled by a uniform, black mass, but not enlarged. Upon one side the sclerotic appeared quite healthy. A trace of the cornea was seen, but not of the lens nor anterior chamber. Just outside of the globe was a large and similar black mass. The remain- der, which constituted a majority of the whole, varied much in color, and consisted partly of a uniform, close, compact white structure, without any trace of discolora- tion, though by far the greater part was more or less dis- colored, and passed almost gradually into the black por- tion. These differently colored portions were distinct, and seemed almost composed of separate lobules. From the posterior extremity of the mass to the globe of the eye the distance was 1^ in.; the optic nerve being nowhere distinctly seen. Di.

Both nostrils obstructed for less than a year ; and a small poly- pus was seen upon one side. The forceps were applied so as to embrace the neck of the large tumor that was sup- posed to exist; but, after many unsuccessful attempts to extract it, the operation was abandoned. The man went to the back of the room to wash his face, the tumor de- scended into the throat, was hawked up, and he came for- ward with it in his hand. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxx. p. 62.) 1864. Dr. H. J.

Dr. S. D. Townsend. 2069. A very large fibroid polypus, the removal of which re- quired the removal of the upper jaw. The patient was a healthy man, twenty-three years of age, who entered the hospital Nov. 17th, 1866 (127, 204), with a polypus in the left nostril, of six years’ duration. Portions had been occasionally removed; and, in 1863, thirteen operations had been performed, with free hemor- rhage each time. Two years before admission a tumor appeared in the left cheek, painless, and of slow growth. On the 17th Dr. B. cut down upon the tumor; and, having ascertained the extent and depth of its connections, heMORBID ANATOMY. 415 decided to remove tlie bone; which was done at once, and with very little hemorrhage. The form of the bones was somewhat changed by the pressure of the tumor, but they were not diseased. The tumor adhered strongly to the na- sal walls, and was at last deeply imbedded in the sphenoid cells, from which last it was entirely removed. On exam- ination, after removal, it appeared to be a benign, fibroid growth, dense and white, but in some places traversed by vessels, so as to give some appearance of a cavernous structure. Its length was about 3£ in. ; its weight, after having been for some time in spirit, 2 oz.; and in form it was very much lobulated. Dec. 19th he was discharged well.

Photograph of a man who had the left upper maxillary bone sawed through, and depressed in order to get at a polypus. The lip was cut through from the left nostril; the flap dissected back from the maxillary bone, and the section of this last was made just below the floor of the orbit. The two upper maxillaries were then divided upon the median line, without involving the soft palate, the left maxillary was depressed, and the polypus having been torn away from the ethmoid bone, the maxillary was restored416 MORBID ANATOMY. to its place, and secured. • Six weeks after the operation a sequestrum was discharged, about 1 in. by ^ in.; but two days afterward the man left the hospital (132, 190), with- out any tenderness of the teeth upon the left side when he chewed. On this date the photograph was taken ; there being no deformity, excepting, of course, a very slight cic- atrix in the hip. 18G9. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2075.

Had had the disease from the first of her recollection, though her mother hadMORBID ANATOMY. 417 told her that it was not congenital. Had often had gum- boils, and was subject to nasal catarrh. Deglutition diffi- cult, and speech thick; and she was obliged to breathe with her mouth open when she took cold. The gums were hypertrophied in each jaw, and upon each side of the teeth, though not uniformly. Two large masses in the roof of the mouth came together in front, but not posteri- orly. There was a dull pain in the jaws most of the time ; and the growths had quite a hard, cartilaginous feeling. On the 26th Dr. J. M. Warren removed all of the upper teeth, and most of the disease in the palate. In October she returned to the hospital, and on the 9th Dr. Hodges removed the disease in both jaws with the scissois, gouge, and saw ; the hemorrhage being considera- ble. On the 18th the entire surface was granulating, and on the 21st she was again discharged. (See two next specimens.) In connection with this case, Dr. H. referred to one that is reported by Dr. Gross in his work on Surgery, Vol. n. p. 534, and one in Mr. Holmes’ System of Surgery, Vol. iv. p. 18. Dr. Hodges also reports that he saw some years ago a very strongly marked case of this disease in a woman who was covered with hair, and exhibited as the “ Bear woman ; ” there being an unusual development of hair in the case reported in Holmes’ Surgery. 1868.

The patient, a negress, set. forty-one, reported that she had never had any permanent molars upon the left side in the low- ei jaw ; and she thought that she had never had any molars there of the first set. About ten years before entrance a tumor formed in the place of the molars, and five years afterward was removed, but soon returned. During the last six months it had grown more rapidly, and was so painful that she was ready to submit to any operation for relief. On in- spection, a dense, lobulated, and very tender tumor was found, about as large as the thumb, and 1£ in. in length. The mass being removed, the tooth was found beneath it, lying horizontally, and entirely surrounded by a delicate fibious C3rst, in which it lay quite loose. The crown was coveied by a pulpy capsule, and this is^hown in the prep- aiation. The cut surface of the mass above it was white, dense, and fibrous, with some spiculfe of bone. The woman did well, and was discharged in about three weeks. 1868. .Dr. R. M. Hodges.MORBID ANATOMY. 420 2092.

This has been noticed particularly in the upper teeth, and about the period of the second dentition ; and with it there may be other indications of disease. Dr. W. has given two other casts to the Med. Soc., and has met with many cases of the affection. 1869. Dr. II. W. Williams. 2093.

From a man, forty years of age, who for some months had had severe neuralgic pain, with a considerable drawing down of the right side of the face; an external swelling then appeared below the lower jaw upon the right side, and it was thought a fistulous opening would form. In about a week, however, this subsided, and a corresponding swelling came on, internally, about opposite the canine tooth. In a few days the calculus appeared at a small opening, and was readily extracted by the forceps, with entire relief to the pain, and improvement of the general health, which had previously declined. 1860.

There was swelling, equal in size to that of a large hen’s egg, with a great deal of pain; and he suffered from it for six weeks. The second was discharged in 1865, and with less pain; the swelling being even with the jaw, and attended with some suppuration, which the first was not. The duration of his second sickness was three weeks. 1868. Dr. Amos B. Bancroft, of Charlestoion. 2096. A sublingual calculus, 1 in. in length, and in. in diame- ter.

When seen, she was very feeble, and had not slept for four days; great dysp- noea, with long, stridulous, and convulsive inspirations; and with acute pain in the ears on swallowing. The trachea was opened, and a canula left in, through which the patient ever afterward breathed freely. The dysphagia, however, increased, and for the last eighteen days she was wholly unable to swallow; fluids passing out at last through the canula. She became extremely emaciated, partially delirious from the want of food, and died fourteen weeks after the operation. Miliary tubercles were found in the lungs, but there was no softening. 1854. Dr. Jas. Deane, of Greenfield. 2106. Contraction of the fauces, so extreme, that a catheter will hardly pass. Parts thickened and condensed, but perfectly cicatrized. The remains of the soft palate upon each side, and the whole epiglottis, so far as can be seen without cutting quite through the stricture, are closel} and strongly adherent to the base of the tongue; the entrance to the larynx being so drawn upon that what was a mere chink has come to be a long and deep fissure. From a woman, set. thirty-seven, who was in the hospital, for a short time, for what appeared to be a syphilitic ulcer- ation of the leg, and who died a few days after her discharge, probably from brutal treatment by her husband. In re- gard to her throat, she reported that five years previously the greater part of the soft palate and tonsils was de- stroyed by ulceration, that had only recently cicatrized, and was still liable to break out. Denied any syphilitic taint; and reported her health as previously good. Appe- tite good ; took solid, as well as liquid food, and was well nourished. No dysphagia, but sometimes choked when asleep. Breathing always labored and stertorous, and particularly on exertion. Voice sufficiently loud, and not hoarse, though hollow and peculiar. She would take in a full breath, and then speak so long as she expired. (Amei. Jour, of Med. Sc., Oct. 1850.) 1852.MORBID ANATOMY. 423 Case of enchondromatous tumor in the palate. No. 3025. 2107. Cancerous disease of the pharynx, extending to the up- per part of the oesophagus, and to the larynx. From a woman, set. thirty-two years. Disease of ten months’ duration. An aching pain constantly in the throat, with a feeling as if there was a large hollow there, beyond which the food did not pass. Strangled on swal- lowing, toward the last, and had to be supported by ene- mata. Much salivation. Hawked up a bloody fluid for some weeks before death. Voice clear, though feeble, until the last week; and afterward spoke in a whisper, though with effort she could speak aloud, even to the last. Some swelling of the cervical glands from the first; and at one time much swelling of the throat, externally, with much dyspnoea. Breathing otherwise easy until the last two or three weeks, when, on swallowing, it would be extremely difficult. Became much emaciated, and was confined to her room the last two months. On examination of the specimen, in the recent state, the whole interior of the pharynx was in a state of open, can- cerous ulceration, as high as where it was cut off. Interi- orly, the disease extended to just below the cricoid carti- lage, which was in the process of being detached by slough- ing. The inner surface of the larynx, posteriorly, was cancerous ; and there projected into the upper back part of the trachea, as seen in the preparation, an encephaloid mass, half as large as a nutmeg. No appreciable contrac- tion of the passage at the seat of disease. The organs of the thorax and abdomen were healthy. 18 19. Dr. John Randall. Sequestrum from the palatine bone; retained for some months, and, as it was supposed, in the air-passages, though more probably in the pharynx. (See No. 1308.)424 MORBID ANATOMY.

The air-passages laid open, and showing a bean*in the cavity, and partially imbedded in the substance of the right primary bronchus ; the walls of this last being soft- ened and deeply eroded, but without the usual signs of in- flammation. A limited portion of the lung was partially hepatized. From a little girl, who was playing with beans, eight da}rs before her death, when she was attacked very sud- denly with urgent dyspnoea, and stretched herself out as she gasped for breath ; but in half an hour she was entirely relieved. After being better and worse for the first three days, she was in such a condition upon the fourth day that it was thought hardly possible for her to live many hours. But as there was pneumonia, and no positive evidence that a bean had been swallowed, the trachea was not opened. For several days the case had been regarded as one of croup. In the evening she became more comfortable, and the symptoms of inflammation afterward subsided. She died, however, very suddenly while sitting up, and appar- ently convalescent. Dr. II. J. Bigelow remarked, upon this case, that it is comparatively safe to leave a hard body; but if, on the other hand, it is one that can swell, the operation should not be delayed. 1863. Dr. G. Ellis.425 MORBID ANATOMY. 2111. A second, and almost precisely similar specimen. The bean, which was tightly wedged into the right primary bronchus, had swelled so as to distend its calibre. The right lung was collapsed and solidified, so as to sink in water ; and the left was infiltrated with lymph. From a little girl, two years old, who had been playing witli beans, and fell as she was running down hill. She was picked up, choking and gasping, and it was thought that one of the beans had passed down the larynx. Twen- ty-four hours afterward Dr. H. saw her at the hospital as an out-patient, with moderate dyspnoea, sublividity, a feeble pulse, anxious countenance, and an occasional cough ; but at no time had there been any paroxysm of cough, or of sudden d}rspnoea. On percussion there was a greater dulness upon the left side of the chest than upon the right. On auscultation the air seemed to enter both lungs with a strong tubular sound ; and over the left, where this was most marked, there was a hoarse, croupy murmur, so that the foreign body was thought to be upon that side. An opening was then made into the trachea, and up into the larynx ; but no foreign body was expelled, nor was any felt by the curved forceps. Inversion, and slapping smart- ly upon the back, were also tried without effect. After the operation the child gradually sank, and died thirty hours after the accident. Dr. H. remarked upon the error of diagnosis in regard to the position of the bean, in conse- quence of the pneumonia, which came on so rapidly, and had been overlooked. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxix. p. 298.) Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2112. A silver half-franc piece, that was accidentally swal- lowed. Six weeks afterward Dr. O. saw the patient, who was a frenchman ; and, though the man was very sure that the coin was somewhere in the larynx, Dr. O. could not, on the most careful laryngoscopic examination, detect it, noi were the symptoms at all urgent. The patient was placed upon a couch, with his head and chest hanging over the side, so that his body was nearly in a perpendicular position; and in this position he coughed forcibly, and was struck several times upon the back. The cough be- came suffocative, and something was felt to move in the426 MORBID ANATOMY. larynx. This experiment was repeated twice; and after the third and last trial, on regaining the upright position, he coughed out the piece of money, with perfect relief. 1869. Dr. H. K. Oliver. 2113. An irregular piece of bone, about 1 in. by £ in. in diam- eter, that was removed from the larynx. The patient was a man, thirty-five years of age ; and the bone, which is a portion of the lamina of a vertebra, was swallowed at 6 p. m. At 11 p. m. the upper part of the tiachea was opened, and the bone was removed. Thei’e had been a hissing sound with the respiration, but much less distress than would have been expected. The man did well, and was discharged in two weeks ; the wound not ha'' big quite closed, though no air passed through it. (Hospital, 135, 200.) 1868. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2114. A tiacheal tube, removed from the right primary bron- chus ; -j&j in. in diameter, and 2 in. along its convexity. The patient was a man, set. forty-five, who had had the operation of tracheotomy performed three times within eight years, and for the last time in December, 1864. The same tube had been worn since the last operation, and for two months it had not been removed. On the morning of Oct. 26th, 1868, he found that it was detached from the plate that was secured about his neck, and at noon he entered the hospital (135, 201) ; as there was, however, very little irritation, he was left until the next da}'-, when the tube was easily removed with the poly- pus forceps, and on the 31st he was discharged, with a new tube. In connection with this case Dr. II. referred to another, in which the tube simply became unsoldered; and to a third, in which fragments of the tube became detached, and fell down into the air-passages. 1868.

Dilators were used to keep the sides of the opening apart; and a double canula was also used. The child, a little girl, five and a half years old, was much relieved by the operation, but died, on the twelfth day, of pneumonia. An abundance of tymph, however, was found, as seen in the preparation ; some of it being a primary formation, and some being formed where a deposit had already been thrown off. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., July, 1853.) The dilators are shown; but, being of iron, they rusted the preparation, and silver ones have been put in their place. 1853. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2118. Thibert’s model.

On the 6th of February he took charge of one of his friends, who had what seemed to be an acute tonsillitis, of moderate severit}7', with a whitish exudation on the fauces, and who died very suddenly on the 10th; Dr. A. endeavoring to resuscitate him by clearing the throat, and by attempted inflation of the lungs. Having had a severe cold, and been subsequently exposed from the 5th to the 10th to much vicissitude of weather, he re- turned from the country on the 11th with sore throat. On the 13th he attended the funeral of his friend, but felt quite unwell on his return, and sent for Dr. M. The dis- ease was then established, and he died on the morning of428 MORBID ANATOMY. the, 17th> in a sud<1™ fit of strangling. The tonsils and m ula were much swollen, with an exudation upon the sur- face, and a copious secretion, which he was constantly hawking from his throat. On the afternoon of the 16th he threw up, with much effort, and symptoms of strangling’ a membrane that looked like a piece of white kid ; 5 in. long, 1 in. broad, and tubular in two places; and during the night two smaller pieces were raised without diffi- culty. (See next specimen.) There were external swell- ing, hoarseness, and sometimes aphonia. Respiration labored at times during the last night; but, previously, no dyspnoea. Dysphagia from the first, but not enough to prevent him from taking liquids freely to the last. Pulse 84 to 108, but during the last night rose to 132. Through- out his sickness he was cheerful, and retained his strength so far as to be able to walk about his room without effort the day before his death. The treatment consisted of stimulants, nourishment, and tonics; and, locally, the use of nitrate of silver, and of chlorate of potash. On dissection, the neck was much swollen ; the epiglot- tis and upper orifice of the larynx swollen, and a false membiane extended from the fauces to the secondary bron- chi. This last was somewhat ash-colored ; and in the tra- chea quite firm, and about ■j-’g- in. thick ; easily separated, and without any very marked change of the subjacent sur- face. (Med. Jour.

Extensive ulceration of the larynx, and probably of syphilitic character. From a man, set. thirty-eight, who had been under the care of Dr. J. for five years before his death, and had been treated for the same disease for one year previously. There was extensive ulceration of the nostrils, with occa- sional discharges of bone, and a falling in of the septum ; and every portion of the throat was successively attacked; the velum, uvula, and tonsils becoming curiousty joined together by cicatrized bands. The voice was husky, and there was considerable pain, with dysphagia. The disease would be apparently arrested for some months, but would reappear upon the suspension of treatment. During the last year he had severe cough, with loss of flesh and appe- tite ; and died finally from acute pneumonia. The inner surface of the pharynx looked as if cicatrized after a burn. Upon the edge of the epiglottis, and as low down as the vocal cords, are little, smooth, rounded nod- ules ; with an appearance of cicatrization between them. The cords themselves are ulcerated ; and the lower portion of the larynx is nearly surrounded by a ragged, burrowing ulcer, the surface of which was covered with pus. Below this the mucous membrane was sufficiently healthy. 1856. Dr. J. S. Jones. 2137. A warty-looking growth from about the ventricle of theMORBID ANATOMY. 431 larynx, upon the right side ; with ulceration and roughness of the membrane upon the left. From a little boy, ten years of age, who for several years had had frequent attacks of what was thought to be croup. After one of them, in Nov., 1850, he lost his voice, and never recovered it. In May, 1851, he was seen by Dr. J. CrosbJr, of Manchester, from whom this history of the case was received. He was then pale and emaciated, with an anxious expression, great dyspnoea, and making strong voluntary efforts during inspiration. Larynx not enlarged nor tender. Cough and expectoration slight; with no physical signs of disease of the lungs or heart; and Dr. C. regarded the case as one of low inflammation, and thickening of the mucous membrane of the larynx. The symptoms increased, and the patient died the following winter or spring. Dr. M., who made the dissection, re- ported a soft, polypoid growth, of a pinkish color, about the size of a chestnut, conical in form, attached by the apex, and nearly filling the cavity of the larynx; so that the patient died from suffocation. The specimen was sent to Dr. W., who had seen the case during life. 1859. Dr. J. Ware. 2138. A well-defined, rounded, fleshy growth, rough upon the surface like a syphilitic wart, and attached broadly just below the ventricles of the larynx. Having been cut through when the larynx was opened, it had a fibro-cellular appearance ; and, microscopically, was found to be epithe- lial in structure. From a man, aet. about fifty years, very fleshy, and in robust health, excepting his local disease. For twelve yeais, oi more, there had been hoarseness, with wheezing, and for the last two or three years complete aphonia. Theie was also much dyspnoea on over-exertion ; and, when asleep, a distressing noise, as from impending suffocation. Death at last was rather sudden, and seemed owing to con- gestion of the lungs. 1850. Dr. Augustus Mason, of Brighton. 2139. A polypoid growth from the trachea. It was described by Dr. F., in the recent state, as firm in consistence, of a rosy color, and about the size of a small grape. The ped-MORBID ANATOMY. 432 icle being attached to the trachea, at the entrance to the right primary bronchus, it had acted as a ball-valve, allow- ing expiration, but forbidding inspiration. Dr. Ellis, who examined it microscopically, found it composed of small granular corpuscles, and with nothing like lobular struc- tuie, though to the naked eye it appeared to sepai’ate into many minute and very loosely coherent lobules. From a young married woman, who had a violent attack of asthma in May, 1859, relieved by the inhalation of ether, and followed for some days by profuse expectoration of thick mucus. The attacks became more frequent and more severe ; and from March, 1860, till August, she never lay down in bed. She then had measles, after which she rapidly grew better, and remained in tolerable health dur- ing the winter and spring. About the 1st of July she was compelled by poverty to give up her only child ; a severe attack soon followed, and she died about a fortnight after- ward. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxv. p. 309.) Dr. F. remarked that he had consulted many authors, but had found no allusion to polypus of the trachea. 1861. Dr. Win. C. JB. Fifield. II. Lungs. 2140.

Improvement, was from the same subject, and the following history of the case is from the catalogue. Near- ly the whole left lung was almost coal-black, and uniformly so. It felt, also, as if it contained tubercles, but none were distinguished; though about midway, posteriorly, there was a small cavity filled with pus. On the right side the middle lobe was similarly affected, the lower somewhat so, and in the upper there was a cavity as large as the fist. No black matter was found in the other organs. Fiom a man, about forty years of age, who died of ‘‘phthisis;” the expectoration being generally character- istic, but for two months unusually dark. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren.

Entered the hospital May 31st (197, 168), with “lung fever.” The acute symptoms soon subsided, but on the 2d of July she had a paroxysm of cough, with hsemoptisis. The cough, which had not been at all urgent before, in- creased. On the 6th the expectoration became quite pro- fuse, purulent, and tinged with blood ; and so continued for some days, but finally diminished. Great prostration followed, with dyspnoea, and she died on the 20th. There was subacute inflammation of both pleurae. The base of the left lung was compressed ; and in its substance was a cavity about 3 in. in diameter, containing a brown- ish fluid, communicating freely with the bronchi, and trav- ersed by delicate bands; inner surface fiocculent, and formed by the pulmonary tissue. In the ant. inf. portion of the right lower lobe was an abscess about the size of a hen’s egg, and similar to the one upon the other side. There was no appearance of pneumonia about these cavi- ties ; and, excepting the remains of former tubercular dis- ease at each apex, the lungs were otherwise healthy. (Med. Jour. Vol. liii. p. 367.) 1855. Dr. C. Ellis. 2151J.

A section of one of the lobes of the lung of a dog, minutely injected by Mr. John Arthur, of the University of Edinburgh, and given by him to Dr. J. in 1851. There was a mass of disease larger than a hen’s egg, consisting of an infiltration of an opaque, whitish, crum- bling material, and within this a compact, uniform, earthy structure, so that the greater part of the mass would be described generally as “ ossified.” This last does not appear in the preparation, which is in spirit; but was well shown in the other half, which was dried. The disease is tolerably defined ; and the structure of the lung is other- wise healthy. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2153.

It is traversed by a firm band, but the inner surface is regular, and the parietes are in part thin. From a man, get. thirt}r-seven, who had active hgemopti- sis, violent cough, and hectic in 1853. In March, 1854, he was seen by Dr. Bowditch, who found the respiration quite obscure over the upper two-thirds of the left lung, and with some rale, but without bronchial respiration or bron- chophony. The symptoms continued, and in April he raised a pint and a half of blood, but was at work on the following day. In Oct. he was able to walk to the office of Dr. B., who then found dulness on percussion in front, upon both sides, and with coarse crackling over the upper two-thirds of the left. Failed rapidly, and died in Feb., 1855. One or two small cavities were found in the upper left lobe, besides the large one ; and numerous miliary granula- tions throughout both lungs. The point of interest in the case is, negatively, the want of correspondence between the actual disease and the phys- ical signs. 1856. Dr. C. Ellis. 2154. A cretaceous mass, from the lung, about £ in. in diame- ter, and surrounded by a dense cyst. Cut open and dried. 1859- Dr. C. EUis. 2155. A few minute cretaceous bodies, that were expectorated by a middle-aged man, who had an acute tubercular attack aftei measles. He was a physician, and was sick for sev- eral months, but fully recovered; the whole amount of the concretions that were thrown off being about a tea- spoonful. 1869. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2156. Echinococci. Ihe apex of the left lung is shown, upon the surface of which is a white, dense, fibrous tissue, about an inch in diameter, and 1 or 2 lines in thickness; with other thin patches of the same near it. Beneath this was a layer of pulmonary tissue, of about the same thickness; and be- neath this a cavity § in. or more in diameter, filled with serum, and lined by a thin, bluish-white membrane, which wras ever}7where studded with yellowish-white points. Most of the serum was lost; but that which remained was of a436 MORBID ANATOMY. yellowish color, and contained a large number of echi- nococci, detached hooks, and a few concentric corpuscles. The lining membrane was covered with the same parasites ; and presented the usual striated appearance. The lungs, otherwise, were quite healthy. From an old man, who died of disease of the bladder. (Med. Jour. Vol. Lvn. p. 218.) 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. 2157. A portion of thick, false membrane, dissected off from the lung; the result of former pleurisy. No. 1575 was from the same patient. 1868. Dr. 0. Ellis. 2158. Pneumothorax. A portion of the upper back part of the right lower lobe, showing a cavity, about the size of a large nutmeg, and from this a perforation into the pleural cavity, about 2 lines in diameter ; with another small cavity near it, and a small, old tubercular mass. There was another small cav- ity, also, at the apex of the lung ; the whole disease being evidently of long duration, and in a state of arrest. The lung was much compressed ; the cavity of the pleura con- taining nearly a quart of pus, and the whole surface being thickly covered with recent lymph. From a young sailor, who had had cough, and was seen by Dr. B. a week before his death, with much dyspnoea, great prostration and suffering, and a very rapid pulse. The right side of the chest was very prominent, resonant, and without respiratory murmur ; and metallic tinkling had been heard. 1852. Dr. H. I. Boivditch. 2159. Empyema. —The patient, set. twenty-three years, had been sick about five months, and entered the hospital July 4th (237, 162). There was pointing between the ribs, upon the left side, and in two places. On the 5th four pints of pus were drawn off, and on the 22d four more; and on the 17th of August he died from copious hemorrhage into the pleural cavity. The whole left pleural surface was covered with a firm, thick, false membrane, and in many places the costal pleu- ra and parietes were deeply eroded ; the ribs being de- nuded at several points. The lung was tubercular. A portion of the parietes of the chest shows the appear-437 MORBID ANATOMY. ances well, and also an opening between the ribs, about l in. in diameter ; air entering freely into the chest before death. 1863. Dr. C. Ellis. 2160. A cyst between the lung and the diaphragm of one of the cattle that was killed during the summer of 1861, and when the “ cattle disease ” was prevalent. It is about 6 in. in diameter; the parietes are thick and dense ; and the contents, which have been removed, consisted of a yellow fibrinous material, and calcareous matter. (See Report of the Mass. Board of Agriculture, for 1860, p. 68.) 1862. Dr. C. Ellis. 2161. A thick, cretaceous plate, that in the recent state almost lined the whole inside of the chest upon the left side.

A small plate of cretaceous matter, about 2 in. in length, and that was situated in a thick layer of condensed fibro- cellular substance, that bound the right lung to the costal parietes. From a man, set. sixty-five; the result, probably, of a disease that occurred about fifteen years before death, and that lasted about a year. The resemblance between these formations, that result from inflammation of the pleura, and those that are found in the bronchial and mesenteric glands, as the result of “tubercular” disease, is often very striking, and tends to show an alliance between this last and the process of “ inflammation.” 1853. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2163. A third specimen ; mostly in one piece, and altogether larger than the palm of the hand.

There is, also, a great degree of shortening, and consequently a strong in- clination toward this side. The situation of the former punctures is seen. The following history of the case was obtained by Dr. C. Ellis, who purchased the specimen for the Museum in 1851, in London ; and who, at the same time, visited and examined the child. She was then eight years old. When three years of age she had what was thought to be “ fe- ver.” At the end of six weeks the side was much enlarged, and was punctured, with great relief, at the London Hos- pital ; and during the next twelve months the operation was repeated five times. Finally, a spontaneous opening took place near the cartilage of the seventh or eighth rib, and the discharge continued until the last eighteen months or two years. Contraction of the side began immediately after the first operation; and the mother thought that it was still going on. Dr. E. found the respiration puerile upon the right side, and absent upon the left. The child was then perfectly well, and was attending school regularly. 1852. Museum Fund. Large fibro-nucleated tumor in left pleural cavity. (See No. 3002.) 2165. A portion of the parietes of the chest, showing numerous cancerous growths upon the pleural surface. From a woman, set. seventy-two years, who had a large encephaloid tumor removed from the thigh by Dr. G. H. Gay, in Sept., 1858. (Hospital, 79, 250.) The disease, which was of five or six months’ duration, was removed a second time in Nov., reappeared in Dec., and she died on the 9th of Jan. From the 23d of Dec. she complained of a sharp pain in the left side of the chest, and some cough ; and, on examination, there was found dulness on percus- sion, with diminished respiration over the lower half of the side. On dissection, the left pleural cavity contained five pints of serum. Lung partially adherent. Upon both pleural surfaces were many bright red, smooth nodules, from a line to 2 in. in diameter ; most numerous, and largest over the439 MOEBID ANATOMY. diaphragmatic and lower part of the costal pleura, where they were almost continuous. Among these were a few small, whitish, semi-gelatinous, pediculated growths, and entirely different from the above. There was no disease of the kind in the other pleural cavity ; but in both lungs were soft, whitish, encephaloid masses, and the same was found in the bronchial glands, and in the liver. Micro- scopically, there were found elongated cells, and many of them were quite long ; in these were elongated nuclei, some with distinct and large, but more with indistinct nucleoli. All were more or less granular. A few large, round or oval bodies were seen ; probably free nuclei, and some con- tained -well-marked nucleoli. The tumor upon the thigh showed cells that contained many granules, or minute glob- ules, and which were evidently degenerating, though to the naked eye the color did not indicate it. There were also a few large and well-developed nuclei and nucleoli; and in the tumors removed during life there was a marked differ- ence of appearance in different portions. 1859. Dr. C.

Hemorrhage into the oesophagus, from the subclavian artery. (See No. 1799.) 2169. Cut-throat. From an insane woman, aet. fifty-six years, who had pre- viously attempted suicide. A cut was made, with a very dull carving-knife, down to the spine, between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and completely divided the oesopha- gus ; the carotid, jugular vein, and par vagum, as after- ward appeared, being uninjured. An elastic tube was car- ried into the stomach ; and the divided extremities of the oesophagus were brought into perfect contact by a suture upon each side, and 6ne in front. The larynx and trachea were then brought together by a strong suture upon each side, and the integuments by two stitches; leaving an opening through which the patient could breathe. The patient was very tractable, seemed to suffer but little, and died within twent}',-four hours. On dissection, the cellular tissue between the oesophagus and spine was perfectly infiltrated with thin pus from the wound to the diaphragm, though the patient lived so short a time ; and the two portions of oesophagus, though gaping posteriorly, are otherwise in perfect contact. In the prep- aration this last is shown, but the stitches in the larynx, and in the integument have been cut away ; and a glass rod has been passed into the carotids. The knife and tube are also shown. (American Jour, of Med. Sc., Jan. 1853, p. 95.) 1854. Dr. B. E. Cotting. 2170.

SeveralMORBID ANATOMY. 441 ineffectual attempts had been made to pass an instrument; and shorty- before death considerable force was used. “ The stricture commences quite abruptly about opposite the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage, is about 1 in. in length, and not more than 3 or 4 lines in circumference upon the inner surface, at the narrowest part. The pari- etes are firm to the feel, consist of a homogeneous, pearly white, condensed tissue, without any appearance of muscu- lar structure, and, at the time of the dissection, cut like gristle. The mucous membrane, however, is continued over it, and seems to be very little altered in structure. Just above the stricture is something like a small uloer, but confined to the mucous membrane ; and a little higher up is a small opening, leading downwards into an irregular abscess in or about the thyroid gland, capable of holding about a drachm, and containing some moderately thick pus. Immediately above the stricture, and upon the right side, there is a fresh laceration, leading downwards, and evidently made by an instrument. There was no dilatation of the fauces, but the mucous membrane just above the stricture was a little red, and perhaps excoriated.” 1861. Dr. B. E. Cotting. Of several cases that I have examined, and that had been regarded during life as stricture of the oesophagus, all, excepting the present one, have proved to be some form of malignant disease ; and the same remark may be made of the rectum, but in this case without a single ex- ception.

The opening into the trachea is about £ in. in diameter. From a woman, set. forty-two, who reported that she had had “stricture of the oesophagus” for twenty-four years, and that it was owing to her having swallowed a chicken bone. For the first two or three years she could take only very small quantities of food, and her health was greatly reduced. She was then relieved by bougies; and from that time her disease gave her very little inconven- ience until about three months before death, when the ob- struction increased, with soreness and pain, and toward the last most distressing dyspnoea. Swallowing of food be- came almost impossible ; and the paroxysms of dyspnoea resembled the spasmodic croup of infants. There had been cough from the first, but no expectoration until the last few daj^s; there being, at last, occasional gushes of puru- lent matter, and in considerable quantities. (Med. Jour.

From a woman, forty-two years of age, who, for five or six years before death, had had dysphagia, and been dis- turbed in her sleep by a peculiar sonorous sound about the larynx. About ten months before death the dysphagia increased, so that she could not take her usual food; with a cough, to which she had been subject, and great irritation about the larynx. By the use of a probang the passage was enlarged, and deglutition became so much easier that she left the city on a journey ; but, on her return, four or five weeks afterward, she was worse than ever, and there was a great deal of pain in the back of the neck, and through the ears. From this time she sank, with very lit- tle pain or cough ; but suffering mostly, toward the last, from the accumulation of viscid mucus in the throat. The disease was remarkably limited ; extending as high as the top of the arytenoid cartilages, and as low as the lower edge of the thyroid. Posterior and lateral portions of the canal affected, but the anterior portion was through- out quite healthy. The diseased structure was from one-443 MORBID ANATOMY. fourth to more than one-half an inch in thickness, white, soft, and upon the inner surface uneven ; the passage through it being sufficient^ free. Just above the limits of the dis- ease was the opening of a dark and offensive cavity, that burrowed down between it and the larynx, and that would have held about two drachms.

He worked, how- ever, as usual through the day, though he did not eat very well at noon. In the evening, as he appeared to be sick, Dr. Stickney was sent for, and was with him until midnight; there being pain in the abdomen, with eructations of flatus. About 4 a. m. he became very much worse, and at 8 a. m. he died. On dissection, not far from a bushel of undigested food was found in the stomach and peritoneal cavity.

An ulcer in the small curvature, midway; and about 1 • in. by f in. in diameter; parietes about it very greatly thickened, indurated and contracted. From a woman, set. thirty-two years, who had had symp- toms of the disease for eighteen years. 1852. Dr. 0. G. Mann, of Newton. 2190. An ulcer, more than 2 in. in diameter, very defined, with- out thickening or other change of its edges; and through- out its whole extent the base was formed b3r the pancreas, as in a case figured by Cruveilhier. The following facts in the case were received from Dr. James Jackson, the attending physician for many years: — “ The patient was eighty-one years of age ; had always been an active merchant, and continued to attend some- what to business until the last year of his life. General health good, until the spring of 1858, when he began to complain of pain in or near the epigastrium, passing through to the back, and recurring frequently every day. He also felt weak, and was troubled by his food. In July, he vomited a large quantity of blood, fainted from the effects of it, and was enfeebled, so that he was upon his447 MORBID ANATOMY. couch for one or two weeks. Dr. J. then regarded the case as one of chronic ulcer of the stomach. The pain was immediately relieved, and there was no return of it until December. It then came on again, and was rather increas- ing, when, in January, 1859, he fell, and injured his hip. In consequence of this accident he kept his bed for a month, and the house for two months; and during this time his stomach was much better than it had been before, — showing the effect, as Dr. J. supposed, of entire rest, and a rigidly simple and abstemious diet. For some months he continued better, and went on tolerably well, until towards the latter part of the summer of 1860, when he began to have dyspeptic symptoms, with loss of flesh and strength; the pain returned about midsummer, and in- creased in severity, so that, during the last few weeks, opiates were required. The appetite failed in November, and never returned ; food caused great distress, though he was very cautious as to the quantity, and generally as to its quality. Vomiting came on, and by this the distress was temporarily relieved ; the matters vomited consisting mainly of the food, though, towards the last, mixed with a dark matter, probably the secretions colored by blood. The bowels were sufliciently well, until he began to use the opiates; and no tumor was ever felt in the epigastrium. Finally, in January, he became limited to very small quan- tities of nutritious liquids and stimulants ; being confined to the house, and mostly to his couch. He sat up, how- ever, more or less, until a week before his death, enjoying his friends, and being able to go up two flights of stairs to bed, every night. An acute pulmonary affection then came on, and under this he sank.” (Med. Jour. Vol. lxiv. p'. 307.) 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2191. Llcei from a man, get. forty years, who had been subject for several years to constipation and nausea; the latter never severe, and generally relieved by vomiting his food. Died at last from perforation, after an illness of about thirty-six hours. The stomach adhered toward its right extremity, to the under surface of the liver, and the pari- etes there were vere very much thickened to the extent of448 MORBID ANATOMY. two inches and a half. In the centre of this thickened portion an old ulcer, about § in. by £ in. in diameter, with bevelled edges, and extending through to the liver; and at the lower edge perforation had taken place. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxii. p. 21.) 1861. Dr. T. E. Francis, of Brookline. 2192. The ulcer here commences at the pylorus, and involves the entire thickness, and almost the entire circumference of the organ. Parietes very little thickened or indurated; but beneath the ulcer is a cavity larger than itself. The base of the ulcer, or rather of the cavity beneath it, which is formed by the pancreas, is perfectly smooth, with a free opening upon one side, into the peritoneal cavity. From a gentleman, aet. seventy-two years, who had been subject to pain in the epigastrium for about twenty years, coming on two or three hours after taking food, and pass- ing through to the back. He suffered also from dyspepsia, flatulence, foul eructations and constipation. About a month before his death he was in bed, with a' very morbid countenance, and was supposed to have a malignant dis- ease of the stomach; there being a vomiting of blackish matter, and a very distinct tumor in the epigastrium. This last, however, disappeared in a week or ten days ; and as the patient was otherwise relieved, the diagnosis was then doubtful. The symptoms of perforation were less marked than usual; and the patient had been out, and about as well as usual, a few days before. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2193.

Oliver. 2196. A shallow, ovoid, chronic ulcer, in the small curvature midway, about 1^- in. by -fa in., and in the base a perfora- tion about three lines in diameter. Almost directly oppo- site, and in the posterior parietes of the organ, is a second ulcer, deeper and more defined, and in extent 1£ in. by | in.; perforation being only prevented by external adhe- sions. The organ was collapsed, and otherwise healthy. The peritoneal cavity contained a large amount of pus, and of offensive gas ; and the liver was pushed very much upwards and backwards. The patient was an ice-dealer, get. twenty-six years, and of good general health. Served in the civil war for four years, and was well during that time, excepting an attack of intermittent fever. Had also occasional cramps in the stomach, with vomiting of a greenish fluid. About two years ago, while pushing a large block of ice up an inclined plane, it slipped; and, as he caught it with his pole, the end of this last came against the pit of his stom- ach, or near there. He was obliged, on account of the in- jui}, to stop work; and, § ij. of senna having been pre- scribed, he took, by mistake, the same amount of the tincture of arnica. Soon after this he vomited a dark substance that is said to have looked like blood ; and from that time he was never well, though he attended to his busi- ness until the fatal perforation occurred. There was generally free vomiting of a yellowish fluid, about two hours after eating; without the food, but with relief, and usually without much nausea. Sometimes a day or two would pass without vomiting ; and several times lie thought he saw blood in the matters vomited. Oppres- sion at the stomach was nearly a constant symptom, and there was quite often a pain that he compared to the « cut- tin0 with a dull knife,’ with an occasional cramp for an lioui oi two , and, when going about in his wagon, he would lean forward and press upon the epigastrium. His appe- tite was quite good, and his bowels rather costive. In his 2d450 MORBID ANATOMY. general appearance be did not look sick, though he had lost fiesh. Early in the night of Feb. 9th perforation took place, and he died on the 28th at 7 p.m. The pain at first was intense, and was very greatly increased by motion ; after- wards it was very considerably diminished, but occurred in paroxysms, and towards the last it was rather dull. Pressure, however, was very tolerably borne, and as well over the epigastrium as elsewhere. At first there was great pain, also, in the left shoulder, but this gradually subsided at the end of a week. To relieve the pain, there was given throughout about three grains of morphine daily, by enema. Tympanites was slight at first, but became very great after the ninth day, and so continued till death, causing great dyspnoea. Respirations from 30-50 per min- ute ; and the pulse, which was about 70 at first, rose at last to 120. The very unusual time that the patient survived the perforation in this case was remarkable, as death usually occurs within forty-eight hours. And it may be a question whether the external injury above referred to, or the arnica, could have had anything to do with the formation of the ulcers, inasmuch as there were some gastric symptoms before these suspected causes occurred.

Two ulcers in the small curvature, and toward the pylo- rus, about half an inch in diameter, very defined, with firm, smooth, sharply cut margins, and firm bases that seemed formed by the submucous cellular coat. From a man, set. thirty-eight years, who had had diar- rhoea for about nine months, and commencing with dysen- tery. On admission into the hospital (71, 241) he had a feeling of oppression and pain after taking food, that led Dr. Minot, the attending physician, to suspect chronic ul- cer of the stomach.

From a woman, set. twenty-six }'ears, who died at the hospital (89, 144) of disease of the breast, with pleural effusion. She had had vomiting for four months, and it was urgent toward the last, with great distress, and a gnaw- ing sensation at the stomach rather than pain ; there was also much thirst, which she freely indulged. 1860. Dr. C. Dllis. 2199. A defined ulcer, about 1£ in. by § in. in diameter; and from the base there projects the open orifice of a vessel. From an intemperate man, who entered the hospital (277, 68) with albuminuria, and had been subject to jaun- dice and constipation. Not long afterward vomiting of clotted blood came on to the amount of one or two pints; and two days afterward, when it recurred, he died. 1868. Dr. G. C. Shattuck. 2200. The entire stomach is preserved. Just at the pylorus, and extending into the stomach, is an irregular chronic ulcer, equal to about ^ in. in diameter; not deep, without thickening, and having a brownish base. The pyloric ori- fice is extremely contracted, and led to a most prodigious distention of the organ, so that it occupied the greater part of the cavity of the abdomen. The stomach con- tained several pints of a homogeneous, blackish, soft- solid substance, that had undoubtedly been accumulating there for a long time. From a woman, set. twenty-eight years, who had had gastiic symptoms as long as she could remember, and very uigent vomitbig during the last eighteen months; her emaciation during the last few months being perfectly ex- treme. (Hospital, 250, 216.) An enoimous dilatation of the stomach is reported and figured in the Proc. of the Pathological Soc. of London, Yol. iv. p. 137 ; but the organ was certainly no larger than it was in the present case. 1863.

From an old woman, who had had symptoms, for some months, that led to the suspicion of scirrhous pylorus. 1854. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2204. A very large, fatty, and fibrous tumor in the parietes of the stomach. From a woman, set. forty-two years, who had been grow- ing very corpulent during the last year of her life, but was quite healthy until the middle of September, 1866 ; having always had a good appetite, and never made the slightest complaint of the stomach. About the time referred to she felt some discomfort on active exercise, and this gradually increased, but was attributed to her corpulence. Nov. 5th, Dr. R. first saw her. She had been attacked in the night with pain in the abdomen, and what was reported as diarrhoea, though it was undoubtedly hemorrhage from the bowels. Under treatment, the discharges ceased for twenty-four hours, and then returned, with great pain, and a great feeling of discomfort in the bowels; described as tarry, black, offensive, and scybalous. With the looseness, there was noticed pulsation of the carotids, a waxy com- plexion, and slight oedema of the face, but none of the extremities. On the 9th there had been no discharge from the bowels ; but she complained very much of a noise in her left ear, which was audible at a distance of two feet453 MORBID ANATOMY. from her head, and was like the chirping of a bird, or the sound of the hair-spring of a watch. During the following night the looseness returned, and before the next day she had had five or six discharges that were evidently bloody. Vision began to fail, was soon quite lost, and never re- turned so long as she lived. Pupils completely dilated, but became strongly contracted under the use of opiates. Two dejections only after the 11th. ' Gradually sank, and died on the 17th. The stomach, which has been preserved entire, shows the tumor “ confined to the anterior parietes, of a regular and flattened oval form, and sufficiently well defined. It measured 6J in. in length, 4J in. in width, and 1£ in. in thickness, and did not approach within 3 in. of either ori- fice. The mucous surface over it was the seat of extensive ulcerations ; one of these measured about 4 by 3 in., two others from § to 1 in. in diameter, and there were others that were quite small. The edges of these ulcers were neither thickened, indurated, nor at all reddened : though the mucous membrane in the neighborhood of some of them was, in the recent state, ecchymosed. The substance of the tumor was fully exposed, so as to form the base of the three largest ulcers ; and the appearance was that of a white, flaccid, tough structure, neither fibrous nor fatty, though, on incision, it seemed to be composed of these two last elements. An incision having been made into it through the serous surface, it seemed to consist of a fatty mass, with no more than the usual amount of fibrous tis- sue. With regard to position, it was shown to be between the mucous and the muscular coats. The stomach, which was otherwise quite healthy, weighed, since the examina- tion, 2 lbs. 2J oz., and a healthy one 6jjr oz. No appear- ance of a malignant character in the tumor.” The intestines were full of disorganized blood. Cavity of the abdomen and anterior parietes loaded with fat; and, microscopically, fatty degeneration was shown to have taken place to a great extent in all of the tissues. Dr. R. suggested the possibility of the tumor becoming enucleated, as fibroid tumors of the womb occasionally are, if the patient had survived the hemorrhage.454 MORBID ANATOMY. For a more detailed history of this case see Med. Jour. Vol. lxxvi. p. 141. 1867. Dr. William Reed. 2205. A large fibroid tumor in the parietes of the stomach. From a woman, mt. fifty-six years, who died at the hos- pital (217, 176) of disease of the heart and kidneys. There were no symptoms referable to the stomach during the last two weeks that she was there, though she had a little nausea, on entrance, that was attributed to the motion of the carriage, in which she was carried to the hospital. A tumor, however, was felt on the left side, on a line with the crest of the ilium, between that and the umbilicus, and traceable down deep into the iliac region ; nodulated on its surface, and yielding under pressure. On dissection it was found to occupy the large curvature and anterior wall; and it was an exceedingly firm, irregu- larly oval, nodulated tumor. A small portion of the exter- nal surface was of a yellowish-white color, and had an almost cartilaginous appearance. The mucous membrane of the stomach extended over the part, which projected internally. At several points were cavities, caused by a loss of substance. The largest of these, about half an inch in diameter, contained a brownish slough, and extend- ed quite deeply into the tumor. On incision, the growth was found to be very firm, of a whitish color, and presented an indistinct fibrous appearance. Examined microscopi- cally, it proved to be purely fibroid in character. The mucous membrane of the stomach was everywheie of a bright red color, and particularly over the tumor. The other organs were examined and found health}'. In the preparation, a large portion of the stomach is preserved, and the structure of the tumor is shown. (Med. Jour. Vol. ux. p. 83.) 1859. Dr. G. E. Ware. 2206. A fibrous tumor, from the stomach of a tiger. The ani- mal was from a menagerie in this city, that was destroyed by fire. Altogether there were six of these tumors, and they were scattered throughout the body of the organ. They were quite defined, of a nearly circular form, from about three-fourths of an inch to an inch and a half m diameter, and projected very prominently into the cavity of the organ, but not at all externally ; nor were there any455 MORBID ANATOMY. peritoneal adhesions about them. Three of them having been cut through, were white, very dense, apparently fibro- cellular in structure, and without the slightest appearance of malignant disease ; the others had the same feel. The}'’ were evidently formed in the submucous cellular tissue, though the muscular and mucous coats had become attached in all excepting the smallest, and which was undoubtedly the one last formed. The most remarkable peculiarity in these tumors was the formation of a deep, defined central cavity, of considerable size, existing in four, with an ap- parent indication of it in a fifth, in the form of a dark-gray line; in the smallest tumor there was no distinct trace even of such a line. The cavity opened always upon the summit or centre of the tumor; and in two the orifice w*as so small, though the cavity within was of considerable size, that the idea of a follicular origin was suggested, though altogether precluded by the general character of the formations. The two smaller tumors certainly seemed to show that the cavity was a secondary formation. In the centre of one of the two largest was a deep, defined old cavity, about three-fourths of an inch in diameter ; and in the hard base of it was a small opening leading into another cavity that was still deeper, and of considerable size. Another curious fact was the crowding of the cavity of three of the tumors with some kind of small parasite, in accordance with the well-known tendency that some spe- cies have to crawl into any opening that they may happen to find in the parietes of the alimentary canal. Upon the surface of one of the largest tumors were four small ulcers just penetrating to the dense mass beneath ; but otherwise the mucous membrane over the tumors generally was quite healthy, as it was elsewhere. 2207. A second tumor, from the same stomach, cut open to show the cavity within. A small portion only of the or- gan is preserved with the tumors. 1862. Boston Soc. of Nat. History. 2208. A very large and anomalous tumor in the parietes of the stomach. It was situated in the posterior parietes, about equidistant between the orifices, and extended lengthwise to the organ 3 in.; the diameter was about in., and itMORBID ANATOMY. 456 projected abruptly into the cavity from five-eighths of an inch to an inch; outline smooth, but form slightly lobula- ted. Externally, it also projected very abruptly into the peritoneal cavity ; the form was more rounded than that of the internal tumor, and there projected from it several well-defined little tumors, the largest of which was about the size of a nutmeg. The diameter of this external por- tion was about 2 in. As the muscular portion was very distinctly traceable to a considerable extent over this last portion, and the mucous membrane was continuous over the internal tumor, it was evident that it was situated in the submucous cellular tissue. The structure was most remarkable. At the very ex- tremity of the external portion was a mass, nearly the size of an English walnut, and which looked like the result of an old tubercular deposit; being quite firm or tough, pearly, with a large number of small, opaque, white spots, and a trace of cretaceous matter, but without any soft deposit. This mass was for the most part well defined, and there was nothing like it seen in any other part of the tumor. The mass above referred to, as being of the size of a nut- meg, was of a dark-red color, uniform in appearance, and as soft as a quite soft spleen. The remainder of the external portion looked not very unlike this last, but it was firmer and very much coarser in structure. The internal por- tion was firm at one extremity, but less so than a fibrous tumor would be. Towards the other extremity it was quite soft, as if the structure beneath was similar to that of the exter- nal portion, and in two places it looked as if the surface was about to give wa}\ The interior of the tumor was occupied by a cavity of some size, well defined, but rather disposed to branch, having two free openings upon the mucous surface, and extending nearly through to the old tubercular-looking mass. The other organs were healthy. The patient was a woman, sixty-seven years of age. For about a year before death she had nausea, gastric pain, and anorexia. Vomiting very rarely occurred, al- though nausea and a distressing faintness existed nearly all the time for the last four months. Rising in bed, or turning from side to side, would increase these symptoms.457 MORBID ANATOMY. Just before death there was vomiting of glairy mucus, with minute ‘ coffee-ground ’ particles, and for three months before death a movable tumor could be felt in the epigas- tric region. 1862. Dr. Alfred Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 2209. Colloid disease, from a very healthy-looking woman, forty-five years of age, who had been dyspeptic for about a year; with frequent vomiting, distress at the stomach, and loss of appetite for five or six weeks. Tumor in epi- gastrium when Dr. S. first saw her, two weeks before death. Her appearance of health was preserved to the last; and she was out as usual within a month of her death. The disease was strongly marked anatomically; involv- ing the whole pyloric portion, to the extent of 4 or 5 in., and just encroaching upon the duodenum. The mucous membrane was first affected, and afterward the muscular; the submucous cellular being but little if at all implicated. Maximum thickness two-thirds of an inch. Surface slightly ulcerated. From the anterior face of the organ there pro- jected externally a mass of the same disease, of consider- able size ; and from the posterior face a similar, but small- er mass. There were also two or three small masses near the small curvature, with traces of the same in the omen- tum near the large curvature; but not elsewhere. The stomach was large; and the mucous surface, where not diseased, was uniformly red, but without any other change. In the preparation one-lialf of the pyloric portion is pre- served ; the other half being in the cabinet of the Soc. for Med. Improvement (No. 957). 1850. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2210.

The preservation of a portion of healthy tissue between the stomach and duodenum, and sometimes when the dis- ease was extensive, has been observed here in other cases, and seems as if it may be a provision of nature to aid the stomach in the performance, however imperfect, of its functions. 2214.

Cast of a well-marked, well-defined, and quite thick mass of soft encephaloid disease, extending about 4 in. from the pylorus, and involving the whole circumference of the organ. The pancreas was somewhat involved ; but, other- wise, the organs were healthy. The patient was a man, about fifty-three years of age, who had been under the care of Dr. H. E. Davidson, of Gloucester, and had been sick about two years. The first symptoms were pain in the epigastrium, coming on about two hours after eating, constipation, and occasional vomit- ing. Sept. 1st, 1863, he had a severe attack, and from that time his health steadily declined. Oct. 10th, 1864, Dr. D. was called to attend him, and found him much emaciated, anaemic, and sallow ; had kept his house for some weeks ; was using milk as causing less distress than any other food ; rejection of all solids ; much dizziness on standing ; bowels very costive, — the discharges being attended with great distress, and sometimes followed by blood. To the left, and a little above the umbilicus, a tumor, of the size of a large hen’s egg, was quite evident. The case was fully diagnosticated by Dr. D., as one of cancer of the pyloric portion of the organ, and the patient, gradually sinking, died on the 28th of the following March. 1866.

In December, when Dr. F. first saw her, there was a peculiar sense of distress on first taking food, and which was generally re- lieved by its rejection. The case was regarded as one of stricture of the oesophagus, from the fact that sbe persist- ently felt and said that the food stopped at an exact spot, about half way down the oesophagus. She was then tak- ing liquids and pap nearly all the time, and vomiting nine- tenths of it within ten minutes. Instruments, however, were passed without resistance.

The entire stomach, showing a soft, and very dark en- • cephaloid mass, projecting into the cavity of the organ. It arises from about the small curvature, and toward the anterior face is of an oval form, perfectly defined, and as large as the fist. Otherwise the organ is perfectly healthy; the disease being so limited to the inner coats, that the muscular is, to a considerable extent, quite healthy beneath it, and, upon the corresponding surface externally, no trace of the disease is to be seen. There was, however, some disease of the glands near the small curvature, and in the liver extensive encephaloid disease. (See the next specimen.) From a man, set. fifty-five, who died Nov. 28th, 1857, and apparently from exhaustion. In 1856 he began to have oppression at the stomach after food or drink, lasting for two or three hours, and sometimes amounting to severe pain ; and this symptom continued throughout his disease. In Sept., 1857, there was a constant uneasiness at the epi- gastrium, with constitutional symptoms ; but he continued to work, as a stove-maker, until the last of Oct. Nov. 10th Dr. A. first saw him ; and food was then relished, though the appetite was small. The liver formed a large tumor, but at the end of a week was still larger. The most striking fact in this case was the absence of vomiting, and even of nausea, throughout the whole course of the disease. 1858. Dr. F. S. Ainsworth.4G2 MORBID ANATOMY. 2227. Colored cast of the stomach, above described. 1858. Museum Fund. 2228. The entire stomach, showing an unusual form of enceph- • aloid disease ; and of which the following description was given, in the recent state. The disease is not continuous, but in separate patches, circular or irregularly oval, about £ in. to rather more than 2 in. in diameter. Altogether there may be about a dozen of them ; but those that seem to be the most recent are indicated by little else than an opacity of the mucous mem- brane, though their outline is sufficiently ■well defined, as is that of the pdtches generally. The larger patches, of which there are four or five, are raised from two to three lines above the surrounding surface, soft in appearance and to the feel, and of a dull yellowish opaque color, with some small dark-red ecchymoses over the surface of two or three. The whole surface of one of these last is deeply ulcerated, but without any induration about it; and there may be a trace of the same in one of the others. Other- wise the stomach is perfectly healthy; there being no dis- ease within some distance of the orifices. There was a tumor, however, externally to it, and closely connected with the stomach and duodenum, which was nearly as large as the fist, and in structure a marked soft encephaloid, with traces of effused blood. From a lad, fifteen years of age, wrho had had intermit- tent fever in the West, but was regarded as perfectly wrell until the 7th of Sept., when he jumped from the back of a wagon, and fell with considerable force upon his “face” or front of his body; followed by an occasional and par- oxysmal pain in the epigastrium, and which would be quite severe on exertion. About four weeks afterward he was running behind a buggy ; and, as the horse was going very fast, when he let go his hold, he again fell upon his “ face,” and with great violence. It was with great difficulty that he walked home ; and, on his arrival, threw himself upon a sofa, very much exhausted, and with great distress at the epigastrium. He, however, recovered so far as to go to school for two weeks; and, at the end of that time, to go to Boston, where he walked about most of the day, seeing463 MORBID ANATOMY. the sights of the city, and eating pie several times in the course of the day. On the following day he vomited after his dinner; and from that time was sick with what was re- garded, by Dr. Dearborn, of Saugus, as typhoid fever; death occurring on the 16th of Nov. During this last sickness there was a disgust for food, and he vomited three times. The youth of the subject, the short duration of the dis- ease, presuming that it did not exceed ten weeks, its com- parative latency, and, anatomically, its peculiar form, are very remarkable points in this case. A comparative latency of the disease is not unfrequently noticed in cases of common encephaloid, as distinguished from “scirrhus of” the organ; this last affecting particu- larly the pyloric portion, and involving more or less the pylorus, whereas the encephaloid is often found in a large, single, defined circular patch in the small curvature, and not far from midway between the two orifices ; the rest of the stomach being sometimes perfectly healthy, and the latency complete.

Encephaloid disease of the pyloric portion of the or- gan. From a man, set. forty-five, who discharged blood from the bowels, and vomited the same, eight months before death; but did not vomit, otherwise, until the last three weeks. There was loss of flesh and strength, and a tu- mor was felt in the abdomen. The disease involves the whole circumference of the organ, and to the extent of about 3 in. from the pylorus ; excepting a small portion of this last. The edges are much elevated, rounded, opaque white, as compared with the rest of the organ ; and, on section, £ in. to 1 in. thick, quite firm, and having a pearly, translucent look, with many, small, yellowish spots. The surface was exten- sively, though not deeply ulcerated ; and where it was not, it resembled the edges. The disease seemed to begin in the submucous cell, tissue ; but this and the mucous wereMORBID ANATOMY. 464 2233. Encephaloid disease of the pyloric portion of the stom- very soon merged, and the muscular, which seemed at first healthy, was quite lost about half an inch from the com- mencement of the disease.

From a woman, set. sixty-three, wrho had been sick about a yeai\ The food was regurgitated as soon as it reached the stomach, and very frequently, but with scarcely any nausea or vomiting; and this wTas her chief symptom. Pain and distress at the epigastrium ; appetite very strong ; habitually very costive, and became very much so toward the last; loss of flesh and strength, with cancerous hue. Death at last seemed owing to a serous effusion into the pericardium. 1868. Dr. Wm. Reed. 2232. Encephaloid disease of the last 4 or 5 in., and whole cir- • cumference of the pyloric portion of the stomach; limits sharply defined; surface irregular and deeply ulcerated, and communicating with a large abscess in and beneath the left rectus muscle. From a man, set. fifty, wrho had been subject for about a year to nausea and occasional vomiting ; and with the gen- eral appearance of one who was suffering from great anae- mia. Three months before death a slightly movable tumor appeared beneath the ribs, and upon the left side. (Med. Jour. Vol. lix. p. 143.) 1858. Dr. G. Ellis.465 MORBID ANATOMY. ach. The diseased mass is well defined, of a circular form, about 4 in. iu diameter, and rises about half an inch above the surrounding surface, in soft, regular masses, that pro- ject beyond the base; situated mainly in the posterior parietes, and within an inch of the pylorus. The organs of the abdomen were matted together as by former peri- tonitis ; but there was no other cancerous disease. From a bootmaker, set. forty-eight years, who had long been subject to dyspepsia and constipation. Gave up his work in Feb.; kept his bed from July, and died in Dec. Dysphagia was an urgent symptom, though the disease was far away from the cardiac orifice. Vomiting one or two hours after taking food; never much pain; great emaciation. Tumor in the epigastrium during the last three weeks. It may be questioned whether the pressure that he must have been in the habit of making, in the exercise of his tiade, may have had anything to do with the development of his disease. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., April, 1852.) Dr. Wm. C. B. Fifield, of Dorchester. 2234. Cancer of the stomach, terminating in perforation. From a man, sixty-eight years of age, who for eighteen months had been subject, a short time after eating, to pain in the epigastrium. Never any hemorrhage or vomiting. The difficulty was attributed to ordinary dyspepsia. The night before his death he was attacked with severe pain just below the epigastrium, and this continued until his death, which took place suddenly on the following morn- ing. On examination about two pints of serous pus were found in the peritoneal cavity. Slight redness of the ex- ternal surface of the upper part of the intestines. In the small curvature of the stomach was a deep excavation, occupy ing the greater part of a soft, whitish growth, be- tween 2 and 3 in. in diameter, which extended nearly to the pylorus. The margin of this was elevated and under- mined. In the centre of the diseased portion was a circu- lai opening, about four lines in diameter, into the perito- neal cavity. There was the acute peritonitis, but no other- disease. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxii. p. 324.) 1860. 30 Dr. C. Ellis.466 MORBID ANATOMY. 2235. Epithelial cancer of the stomach. The pyloric extrem- • ity of the stomach is nearly surrounded by a soft, white growth, which extends inwards 2 or 3 in. from the valve. Its margin is undermined, and somewhat elevated above the surrounding surface, but the remainder of the growth appears to have lost a part of its substance ; the base being sunken and irregular, and formed by the exposed disease, long shreds of which floated up, on placing the part in water. There was no disease elsewhere. Dr. E. found that on microscopic examination, the dis- ease was composed of cells and nuclei, more or less granu- lar, but not larger than those of cylinder epithelium. They were round, more or less elongated, some being fusi- form, or pointed at one end only. A few had a decided columnar arrangement. From a gentleman, set. fifty-nine, who died after eleven months’ sickness, and whose previous health had been per- fectly good. The disease began with “ cholera-morbus,” fol- lowed by loss of flesh and strength, some nausea and dis- tress after eating, and occasional diarrhoea. As it ad- vanced, the vomiting occurred at intervals of from ten to twenty days, not violent, nor preceded by nausea, but sud- den, and followed by extreme exhaustion. No tumor ever felt. (Med. Jour. V-ol. lxiv. p. 546.) 1861. Dr. G. Ellis. III. Intestines. 2236. Small intestine, torn entirely across, and mesentery to the extent of 3 in., as shown in the preparation. From a man, set. twenty years, who was jammed be- tween two railroad cars, and died, in twenty-one and a half hours, in great agony. There was a prominent tumor in the left side of the abdomen, with some ecchymosis, and hematuria. . A lar<re amount of blood was found in the peritoneal cavity, and there was free escape of air.

The appearance of external injury, in case of rupture of the organs of the abdomen by external violence, seems to be very exceptional; and, as the fact is so different from what would be expected, it deserves especial notice in refer- ence to diagnosis. 1849. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2237. A portion of the rectum, showing the mechanical injury • that was done by the passage of a bougie. From a gentleman, set. sixty years, who died after a short sickness, with symptoms of obstruction, connected with an annular stricture, 15£ in. from the anus. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. The above is only one of several cases that I have ex- amined, and in which the passage of some instrument into the rectum has been the immediate cause of death. 2238.

This affection I have met with very frequently in the large intestine, but never in the small; excepting two ca- ses (ISo. 2242 ; and No. 486, in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet) ; but these two were otherwise exceptional. Others, how- ever, have found it only in the small intestine ; and a case has been figured by Sir A. Cooper, in his work on Hernia. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2241. A second and very remarkable specimen ; the arch of the colon being the part affected. The sacs are much larger than they are generally seen, and so numerous in some468 MORBID ANATOMY. parts as to be crowded together. The fat, with which the whole intestine was perfectly loaded, having been removed by a laborious dissection, the intestine has been inflated and dried; the sacs being extremely thin. No. 1017, in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet, was from the same individual, has been similarly prepared, and shows the sacs scattered along as far as the rectum.

Sacculated dilatation of the intestine; cut open and preserved in spirit; and a second, inflated and dried, with a portion of the intestine. From a farmer, set. seventy-two years, who died, after a sickness of twelve hours, with “coffee-ground” vomit- ing. Nine or ten hernial protrusions of the mucous membrane were found, as large, or larger than the intestine itself; and nearly all of them were in the upper part of the jeju- num, though one or two were nearer the ileum. There were also several quite small sacs. Some of them were within 2 or 3 in., and others some feet apart. Some were on the attached portion, as in Sir A. Cooper’s case, above referred to, and others upon the free portion of the intestine. 1856. Dr. Jas. R. Wellman, of Fitcliburg. 2243£.

(See No. 945, with a figure, in the Catalogue of the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet.) 1869. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2244. A portion of intestine that, protruded from the anus, after much straining, on the sixteenth day of dysentery, and was cut off with a pair of scissors ; a few drops of blood only following the incision. The patient, set. six months, had prolapsus daily for the first six days, and occasionally afterward, but in the course of three months was quite well.MORBID ANATOMY. 469 The specimen is about 4 in. in length; and was found by Dr. J. Wyman to consist of mucous membrane, ves- sels, and areolar tissue. He also found what he supposed to be circular muscular fibres under the microscope ; and in the preparation he has passed bristles into an artery, and a vein. It was stated that, two or three days after the removal of this portion, a second was expelled by the nat- ural efforts, about an inch in length. 1855. A similar case, with recovery, is recorded in the Proc. of the Pathological Soc. of London, Vol. m. p. 370; all the tissues of the intestine being included. 2245.

Intussusception, at the junction of the small and large intestine. The first has passed onward, and the caecum retains its place ; the appendix projecting from the neck of the invagination. 1847. Dr. J. Q. Warren. The fatal, as distinguished from the simple form of Intus- susception, is found, according to some authors, some- times in the small intestine, sometimes in the large, and sometimes at the junction of the two. In every case, however, that I have examined, excepting one, and in which it was confined to the rectum (No. 509, in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet), I have found it at the junction of the small and large intestine ; and, further, the inverted caecum has inva- luably been found at the extremity of the invaginated por- tion, excepting one case (No. 492, in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet). 2248. Intussusception, from a child five months old. Taken sick on Sunday evening, but no alarm felt until Tues- . day, at 4 a. at., when it passed clotted blood from the bow-470 MORBID ANATOMY. els, and moaned with pain. From 2 until 8 p.m., on that day, there was no further discharge ; but from that time until Wednesday, at 5 a. m., when it died, there were fre- quent and small discharges of fresh blood and mucus. The invaginated portion is 8 in. in length ; and, upon the middle portion of the intestine, there was a thinly scat- tered deposit of lymph, with some mucus, but no blood. The orifice of the appendix caeci is indicated in the prepar- ation, by a glass rod. 1866. Dr. A. H. Johnson, of Salem. 2249. Intussusception, from a child, set. three years. April 2d it had a short attack of colic; and on the 3d the same, with vomiting. On the 14th the pain at the navel became fixed ; but until the 18th it ate and played as usual. All the symptoms then increased ; and on the 19 th there was constant vomiting. The abdomen was not distended ; but a tumor was felt in the- iliac fossa. Nothing felt within the rectum. On the 21st, at 3 a. m., the child had a natu- ral dej.; and in the afternoon some bloody serum was passed. On the 22d an enema was given, and rejected with a good deal of force ; and the intestine was then seen as well as felt, at the anus. On the 23d it was carried to the hospital (133, 225), where it died about eight hours after admission. The large intestine was completely doubled upon itself; so that, in the preparation, the orifice of the appendix crnci is seen at the very extremity of the protruding mass, and just above it the opening from the ileum, the opening of the appendix being marked in the preparation by whale- bone, and that of the ileum by a glass rod. (Med. Jour., Aug. 6th, 1868.) 1868. Dr. B. J\L Hodges. 2250. Strangulation of the intestine, by the appendix caeci. From a woman, set. forty years, and a patient of Dr. H. M. Lincoln, of Westminster. Two months before her death she was thrown from a vehicle, and injured so as to be confined to her bed for four or five weeks. About six weeks after the accident, and when still quite feeble, she rode two or three miles over a rough road, and in a wagon of which the body rested directly upon the axletree. After this she took to her bed, and never again left it.MORBID ANATOMY. 471 Her symptoms were those of peritonitis, with some colicy pain, but no more vomiting than would have been caused by the active cathartics she took ; the effect of these last being very partial. The appendix caeci adheres strongly to the mesentery by a fibrous band that arises from its extremity, and that is not larger than a knitting-needle. The very lower extrem- ity of the ileum, to the extent of 4 or 5 in., is the portion strangulated ; but the strangulation was by no means tight, even in the recent state. The intestine was, as usual, much distended above, and contracted below the strangu- lation. Peritonitis considerable in amount; and it was a very unusual complication, so far as has been observed here. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., July, 1853.) 1854. Mr. J. L. White, rued, student. 2251.

Some have an opening at the summit, through which the contents are seen ; but over the rest the mucous membrane is continuous. 1867. Dr. H. 0. Marcy, of Cambridgeport. 2253. Follicular enteritis. The patient was a little girl, three years old, who was taken with vomiting after eating heartily of pigs’ feet for hei breakfast, on the morning of Dec. 10th; the vomiting continuing until she died, on the 15th, at 3 a. m. Toward the last it was very urgent, and partially digested blood was thrown up. On the first day she took a cathar-472 MORBID ANATOMY. tic without effect; but after enemata she had dark and slimy discharges, and afterwards several that were green- ish. And these were all the discharges that she had dur- ing her sickness, though cathartics and enemata were given. Pain in the abdomen, and of a colicy character, was a nearly constant symptom throughout, with tender- ness. There was some pain in the epigastrium, and some tenderness over the abdomen, but otherwise this last was natural. On the evening of the 14th she was in a state of collapse, constantly restless, and crying out, with her hand on the epigastrium ; the abdomen not tympanitic, but full and hard about the caecum ; laudanum was ordered p. r. n., and two enemata were given, containing ol. terebinth, but without effect. The disease was almost continuous throughout the upper half of the large intestine, so that its follicular character would not have been suspected ; the surface being rough, of an opaque whitish color, and abraded, with very con- siderable thickening. Healthy patches of mucous mem- brane, however, soon began to appear, and these gradually increased until the disease had for the most part disap- peared ; but as low down as the rectum, the surface was everywhere more or less scattered with follicles, about the size of mustard seed, singly or in small groups, and evi- dently the commencement of the more advanced disease. In the lower part of the small intestine, also, were numer- ous isolated follicles, similar to the above, and, like them, not ulcerated nor abraded upon the surface. Peyer’s patch- es in the lower part of the intestine were much raised, rough upon the surface, and opaque as if thinly coated, and even infiltrated with lymph. Blood and some bile were found in the stomach and upper part of the small intestine ; and the intestines otherwise were healthy. 1869. Dr. Samuel G. Webber. 2254. Thibert’s model.

These last were opaque, of a dirty white color, stained by the faeces, about a line in thickness, and, microscopically, appeared to consist of a granular and fibroid substance, with epithelium. The mucous membrane of the last'two or three feet of the ileum was much inflamed, in strongly marked trans- verse folds, and covered by a slight deposit of lymph.

The patient was a lady, aet. thirty-seven years, who, having been indisposed for a few days, was attacked sud- denly and violently with pain in the abdomen, and died on the ninth day. There was more or less pain throughout; some vomiting; no free dej.; pulse nearly imperceptible from the first. On dissection, there was found extensive peritonitis. The first half inch of the appendix was quite healthy; but the rest was inflamed upon the inner surface, and tending to gangrene. In the cavity were very numerous masses of faecal matter ; and one much larger than the rest, protruded from an opening through the parietes of the appendix, and476 MORBID ANATOMY. near its origin ; the opening being two and one-half lines in diameter, and the edges quite sloughy. 1849. Dr. C. G. Putnam. 2275. A second specimen. From a gentleman, about thirty- five years of age, who sank gradually, and died in eleven days ; a patient of Dr. Bowditch. Great pain and tender- ness, with fulness over affected part. Vomited' freely eight or nine times the day before death. Bowels gener- ally loose, or kept so. A large cavity was found in the cellular tissue, behind the ascending colon, and containing a blackish and very offensive fluid ; a very similar fluid being found in the colon. The preparation shows a small portion of the ileum and large intestine ; the inner surface of the cavity ; the appen- dix cseci cut off abruptly 2 in. from its origin, and opening directly into the cavity ; but otherwise healthy ; and direct openings into the cavity from the caecum. The neighbor- ing muscles were to some extent dark green, and contained thick pus. The pleura was also inflamed at the base of each lung. In the cavity was a calculus, that probably es- caped from the appendix, and was the source of the whole trouble. 1858. Dr. C. Ellis. 2276. A third specimen, from a patient of Dr. D. H. Storer; a man who had had great pain in the back and right hip, extending down the thigh ; with tenderness in the groin, and afterward fulness there as from suppuration; the fulness subsequently disappearing. The whole duration of the disease was short. An extensive abscess was found in and about the right iliac region, and it communicated freely with the caecum and the appendix caeci; the opening into the caecum being evidently from without inward, and explaining the subsi- dence of the fulness observed during life.. No foreign body was found ; but there may have been one that escaped into the caecum. Some of the bones were denuded. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxv. p. 61.) 1861. Dr. C. Ellis. 2277. A fourth specimen. The appendix caeci is sloughy, and perforated at its extremity. From a college student, set. twenty-one, who had been illMORBID ANATOMY. 477 for two weeks. Daring the first half of his sickness he was confined to his room for three or four days, but with- out any marked symptoms. Then there came on a'severe rigor, followed by colicy pain, and relieved by a discharge from the bowels. The case was particularly characterized by a recurrence of such paroxysms once or twice every twenty-four hours ; the chill lasting about twenty minutes, and being followed by heat, and an active pulse ; the pain lasting for three or four hours ; and each attack being re- lieved by a copious dej. During the intervals he kept his bed, but was quite comfortable, and with a pulse of 65. On the day before his death he was particularly comfort- able, and asked for steak; but, at 4 p.m. a very severe rigor came on, followed by prostration, and he died the next day, at 10 a. in. On examination, a general peritonitis was found, espe- cially in the right iliac fossa; and in the appendix three or four masses of old faecal matter, with some mixture of the triple phosphate. The case, which occurred in the practice of Dr. Ezra Palmer, was further remarkable for the absence of nausea, vomiting, and constipation. (See No. 2331.) 1867. Dr. J. Homans.

One is about two-thirds of an inch in length; the base is formed by the pancreas, and at one point it approaches very near to the peritoneum. The other is less deep, and smaller. From a child, five years of age, that had acute pleurisy ; and at the end of a week died with symptoms of internal hemorrhage, after three hours’ continuance. — A large amount of blood was found in the stomach, and throughout the intestines ; and on moving the body after death, blood escaped from the mouth and anus.

Ulceration of the small intestine. The ulcers extended throughout this intestine; and were shown, microscopi- cally, not to be formed directly in the old tissues, but in a new material that was first formed in them ; this last being “ composed of fibroid tissue, some fibro-plastic elements, and many small nuclei with small nucleoli.” Perforation took place six or seven feet from the pylorus. From the same case as No. 2197. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxxi. p. 241.) 1864: Ev. E. Ellis. 2286. Ulceration of the small intestine, from the same patient • as No. 2185. The ulcers were scattered throughout the whole of the small and large intestine, and resembled those in the stomach; largest and deepest in the jejunum, where some of them were perhaps two-thirds of an inch in diam- eter ; dark gray and cicatrizing in the large intestine.

Ulceration of the large intestine. About midway the mucous membrane was almost entirely destroyed to the extent of 6 in.; and throughout the whole of this intes- tine there was more or less ulceration; the base of the largest, and many of the smaller, ulcers being covered with large, grayish granulations. From a very corpulent woman, set. sixty-eight years, who had had diarrhoea for six weeks and a half, but yielding readily to treatment, so that on two or three occasions her physician, Dr. Salter, discontinued his attendance ; charac- ter of the disease dysenteric at first, with constitutional sjunptoms. Death at last rather sudden. There was some valvular disease of the heart, diseased liver, gall-stones, and fibrous tumors of the womb; there having been some corresponding symptoms, though her general health had been good.

Superiorly very defined, and burrowing ; the muscular coat below this look- ing as if clearly dissected. For the last inch and a half it is not so much an ulceration as an irregular abscess, bur- rowing between the rectum and the vagina. Above the seat of disease the mucous membrane was quite healthy, excepting a fistulous opening into a portion of the large intestine, that adhered to the rectum, as seen in the prepa- ration. 1861. .Dr. J.

There were two in the caecum, and four or five others in the ascending colon. All had pedicles ; and the largest was of the size of an English walnut. From a woman, about sixty years of age, who died of pneumonia. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxiv. p. 211.) 1861. Dr. D. W. Cheever. 2300. A second specimen. From a hospital patient, who died of cardiac disease very soon after entrance. “ Attached to the posterior wall of the rectum, at a point 7 in. from the anus, by a pedicle upward of half an inch in diameter, was a soft, highly vascular, lobulated and villous, cauliflower-like excresence, about 2 in. in diameter, rising from half an inch to an inch above the surrounding surface. It apparently involved the mucous coat alone. “ Microscopically, it was composed of much elongated, granular, nucleated cells, some of which resembled long columnar epithelium, and were arranged, like the last, in close juxtaposition. Others, though elongated in the same manner, had more irregular outlines, and resembled cells found in a variety of morbid growths.” 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. 2301. A portion of the large intestine; distended and dried, and showing a stricture 15 in. from the lower extremity. It was strictly annular, and looked almost as if girt by a string ; firm, but not of scirrhous density, and not adherent externally. The large intestine above the stricture was, throughout, greatly distended, and contained an immense quantity of soft faeces ; the small intestine was also very much distended by thin faeces and gas. Below the stric- ture, the intestine was of about the usual size. The parts having been removed and washed out, a portion of the in- testine above the stricture was filled with water, but not a drop passed through; it was then inflated, under water, but it was not until several trials had been made, and with 31482 MORBID ANATOMY. considerable force, that a little air could be made to pass through ; nor was this last result obtained subsequently. The intestine having been inverted, there was found, at or just above the stricture, a well-defined, somewhat deep ul- cer, not more than one-fourth of an inch in width, and not at all remarkable in its character, but involving the entire circumference of the intestine. Otherwise the dilated in- testine was quite health}'', though the muscular coat was much hypertrophied. The other organs were also healthy, excepting the uterus, which contained two fibrous tumors, that were felt during life through the vagina. From a woman, set. thirty-four years, previously healthy, and who died on the 22d of November. In April she had an attack of obstinate constipation, pain in the abdomen, and vomiting ; relieved by cathartics. In June a similar attack. During the last week of July a still more severe attack, and from that time she was never relieved. Hard- ened scybalse were occasionally brought away by active cathartics and enemata; but for some weeks before death these last only were used, and for the last seventeen days nothing whatever passed the bowels. The abdomen was very greatly distencjed, and generally very tense ; portions of the intestine sometimes feeling like solid tumors, and in a few moments relaxing under the hand, as the muscular spasm yielded. Vomiting was an urgent symptom. 1857. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. The above case was published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lv. p. 448), with a brief analysis of five other and similar cases that I have met with. 2302. A portion of the ileum, about 3 feet above the valve, • very greatly contracted, and to the extent of about 2 in. Inner surface for the most part superficially ulcerated ; but without thickening of the parietes, or any appearance of malignant disease. The intestine above was much dilated, and somewhat ulcerated ; but otherwise healthy, as it was below the seat of disease. Three or four feet higher up, also, the intestine was contracted ; and again in the duo- denum, 2 in. below the pylorus. From a patient of Dr. Stone, Jr., of Walpole; set. fifty-483 MOKBID ANATOMY. seven years, and bad bad diarrhoea, with constant pain in the abdomen for two years. 1861. Dr. C. Ellis. 2303. A portion of small intestine, thickened by encepbaloid * infiltration. Many portions of this intestine were simi- larly affected; and particularly the duodenum at its origin. Also the caecum. From a woman, set. twenty-three years, who bad occa- sionally bad difficulty of digestion for some years; and constantly the last six or seven months. Pain, with sense of fulness in epigastrium, constant. No vomiting until Quite late in the disease. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxvi. p. 233.) 1862- Dr. C. Ellis. 2304. Disorganization of the caecum, commencing at the valve, and affecting the whole circumference, to the extent of 2 in. It had a foul and very malignant look, though there were none of the usual appearances of cancer. From a lady, about fifty years of age, and who had been sick about eight months. A silver-coated, and unmistaka- bly assafoetida pill that had been taken about six weeks before, was found at the seat of the disease. 1850. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2305. A portion of the arch of the colon, and of the sigmoid flexure, firmly adherent by encephaioid disease, and°com- municating freely with each other. There was, also, the same disease in the liver. From a gentleman, jet. sixty-seven years, who was at- tacked about a year before his death with pain in the abdo- men, followed by vomiting and ‘emaciation ; and a tumor m the left iliac region. He improved afterward so as to attend to his duties in the Legislature ; but died at last exhausted by his disease. (Med. Jour. Vol. nxv. p. 271.) 186L Dr. C. Ellis. 2306. Cancer of the large intestine. At the junction of the sig- moid flexure and the rectum the canal was closely constricted by a c‘rcular g1-owth, which involves from 1 to 2 in. of the wall, the thickness of which is increased to a quarter of an inch. I he mucous surface is red, but apparently smooth. Hie submucous cellular coat was thickened, firm, and of a whitish color. Muscular coat thickened and striated for484 MORBID ANATOMY. the most part, hut in the centre the coats are all blended in the morbid tissue. Ou microscopic examination of in- testine, there were seen some large but indistinct nuclei, like those belonging to malignant formations ; but the fatty degeneration was so extensive as to make it impossible to pronounce with accuracy upon the exact chaiacter of the elements. —The liver weighed nearly nine pounds, and contained very numerous cancerous masses. From a woman, who had been for a long time consti- pated, oppressed after her food for about a year, with more or less nausea, pain, and fulness in the abdomen. About ten days before death she took an active cathartic, but she had no discharge from the bowels from that time. There was vomiting, with much pain and oppression, and she gradually sank. Her mother died ol cancer of the womb, and her grandmother of the same disease in the breast. (Med. Jour. Vol. LXin. p. 343.) 1860. Dr. C. Ellis. 2307. Colloid disease of the whole rectum ; with an opening at the upper part into the bladder, which last was greatly con- tracted and coated with a phosphatic deposit. From a gentleman, seventy years of age, who had been perfectly healthy until within a few years of his death. His principal trouble was an almost constant desire to evacuate the bowels, with discharges of a highly foetid substance. Gradually sank under his disease, but never had a moment of what could be called pain. For the last week or two there wa§ a discharge from the rectum thiough the urethra. (Med. Jour. Vol. lex. p. 283.) 1858. Dr. J. M. Warren. 2308. A second specimen. — Just above the anus is a vei}r nai- row strip of healthy intestine, though at the orifice is a considerable mass of the disease, that seemed to be seated in the hemorrhoids, that occasionally protruded during life. The principal disease is nearly 3 in. in extent, and involves nearly the whole circumference of the intestine ; perfectly well marked, and not complicated with an} othei form of disease. From a woman, about fifty years of age, and who had485 MORBID ANATOMY. been suffering from the disease for three years ; her chief symptoms being an intense, paroxysmal, and increasing pain, passing up through the rectum, and as high as the top of the sacrum. Very little hemorrhage ; and no vesi- cal nor uterine sj'mptoms. (Med. Jour. Vol. xlvi. p. 86.) 1862. Mr. Albert Wood, med. student. 2309. Scirrhus of the rectum, from a lad about seventeen years of age. The disease was of eleven months’ duration, and came on with pain in the umbilical region, followed by vom- iting, indigestion, and constipation. Eight months after- ward, and when first seen by Dr. H., there was emaciation, with much pain, and especially on defecation. The pain, however, was never referred to the rectum, but always to the region of the transverse colon. On examination, the intestine felt very irregular, and as hard as a scirrhous breast. A month before the lad’s death, the obstruction gave way, and he had free dejections, but the pain contin- ued. On dissection, the disease was found to commence an inch or less from the anus, and to extend upward about 3 in. ; involving the whole circumference of the intestine, and being deeply ulcerated almost throughout. The intes- tine was very closely adherent to the walls of the pelvis. The bladder was involved ; the ureters nearly obliterated, and higher up greatly distended ; and there were very slight traces of disease upon the peritoneum. The age of the subject in the above case was very re- markable. 1861. Dr. Anson Hooker, of E. Cambridge. 2310. Cast, in plaster, of a cancerous rectum ; colored. From a farmer, sixty-eight years of age, and of robust health. He had been treated for piles for about a year, when, about ten months before death, he came under Dr. T.’s care. The sensation in the rectum he described as of weight, fulness, or distention; and there was frequently a slight discharge of mucus or blood, but without much actual pain until about a month before death, when both the pain and the discharges were considerably increased, with an almost total loss of control of the sphincter. The discharges had been constantly offensive, and toward the486 MORBID ANATOMY. last were more so. Tenesmus was frequent, but never very- distressing. Throughout the disease, the bowels acted pretty regularly, but always with pain; this last being se- vere during the last week, but it -was apparently rather from tympanitic distention than from the disease itself, and •was readily relieved by small doses of opium and conium. The appetite, which was alwaj^s sufficient, was sometimes craving, and his food seemed to be well digested. He gave up work about a year before his death, but frequentl}1, rode short distances without pain or inconvenience, though walk- ing caused an aching pain so long as he was under Dr. T.’s care ; during the last three months he kept his bed. The pallid, straw-colored complexion of cancer was well marked ; but the emaciation was less marked than would have been expected. The disease commenced about 2 in. from the verge of the anus, and extended upwards 4 in. The whole circumfer- ence of the intestine was involved, the limits of the disease were perfectly defined, and the general appearance showed unequivocally its malignant character, though there was nowhere any encephaloid, scirrhous or colloid deposit to be seen. No trace of the original tissue of the intestine could be distinguished upon the cut surface, but the whole had a soft, opaque, thickened, and perfectly disorganized look; the structure was loose or coarse, and infiltrated with fluid, with many quite small, superficial sloughs upon the sur- face. In one place the diseased structure was destroyed to the extent neai’ly of an inch, and at the bottom of the cav- ity was a large slough. The intestine immediately above the seat of the disease Avas health}^, excepting a number of quite small and superficial ulcerations ; there being very little if any thickening or dilatation. Dr. T. found the diseased portion of the intestine so adherent to the sacrum that it was removed with some difficulty. The other or- gans he found healthy. Microscopically, it Avas regarded by Dr. Ellis as a malig- nant disease, though it did not show the usual elements of cancer, — as the gross appearances did not to the naked eye. (Med. Jour.

The largest is about 3£ in. in diameter, and weighs 2 lbs. 3£ oz. ; form very regular ; rounded, with some flattening, and with one marked facjette. The smallest is between 2 and 3 in. in diameter, weighs 9J oz., is not rounded, and has very marked fa^ettes; having been sawed, the concentrically laminated structure is strongly marked, and for a nucleus there is seen a piece of iron, a few lines in diameter, as it appears upon the cut surface. The third specimen weighs 18£ oz., and is intermediate between the two others in re- gard to size and fa^ettes ; on section, it resembles the sec- ond in structure, and in having a piece of iron for its nu- cleus. In all of the three the color is a pale brownish, with a mixture of gray; the structure of the two that have been sawed is rather coarse than otherwise ; and the lam- inated structure of the largest is perfectly well marked ex- ternally. Dr. James C. White found them to consist mostly of the triple phosphate of ammonia and magnesia; a little phosphate of lime, and a trace of carbonate of lime.

A portion of small intestine from a hog, inflated and dried, with the mesentery, and showing a sub-peritoneal emphysema that was quite extensive. The specimen was sent to Dr. B., who referred to Mr. Paget’s description of the affection, under the head of “ Gaseous cysts ” (Surg. Path. p. 309) ; to Mr. Hunter’s figure of a similar case; to the remark of Mr. H. that hogs are subject to ulceration of the alimentary canal; and to that of the butchers that this appearance of air-cells is not of rare occurrence. In connection with these last statements, Dr. B. further referred to the same form of emphysema that he had seen in a case of ulcer at the pylorusand I have seeu the same in a case of perforation of an ulcer of the duodenum. Dr. B. supposed, in his case, that the air was forced into the cellular tissue from the stomach, and through the ulcer. In the present case the stomach was not sent with the intestine ; but the animal was said to be healthy, excepting the emphysema. 1854. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2339.

In Dec., 1862, he was very much jarred and bruised by a fall upon the ice; and, besides general pain and soreness, he had great pain and tenderness across the abdomen, just below the umbilicus. On account of this last, he was often obliged to lie down, and finally to give up his business. His general health also failed ; and he soon noticed a fulness of the abdomen, that went on increasing. On the seventh of February, when Dr. R. first saw him, he was quite feeble, with an anxious countenance and difficult respiration, but without the look of a very sick man. The abdomen was full and tense, and felt below the umbilicus as if it would burst. The diagnosis was ascites, with peritonitis, as the result of the fall. April 13th, about six quarts of an oily-looking sub-MORBID ANATOMY. 494 stance, with a great quantity of fibrous matter, were drawn off; and showing, microscopically, innumerable cells, mostly degenerated by fatty metamorphosis. It was thought after this that there must be a cyst. In May and June he was tapped five times, and after the 20th of June the canula was left in ; the fluid varying more or less at the different operations. Sinking was gradual, with great emaciation, great pain, and tenderness of the abdomen, oedema of the lower extremities, vomiting at last, and death on the 8th of July. On dissection, the parietes of the abdomen, the omen- tum, and the interior of the abdomen generally contained a great amount of colloid deposit, in which the microscope showed an abundance of fat; the organs being healthy. There was also an extensive and recent peritonitis. 1866. Dr. W. Read. 2347. A peculiar and probably malignant disease of the omen- tum. The following account of the case was from Dr. Asa Millet, of Abington, with whom Dr. J. saw the patient. She was thirty-nine years of age; had been sick nine weeks when Dr. M. first saw her, and had been treated for ascites. Health previously good. Dr. M. found some ascites, with a tumor, three or four inches in diameter, near the left iliac region ; and he felt tumors by the vagina and rectum. She was much emaciated, and complained chiefly of exhaustion, but not much of pain. The tumor and the ascites increased; and she died three weeks afterwards. The omentum, which was sent to Dr. J., was very greatly thickened, with rounded edges, smooth upon the surface, and dense to the feel. On incision, it was uniformly white, and quite tough, as if composed of a fine and compact fibro- cellular tissue. The uterus, which wras also sent, wras com- pletely invested with the same material, and its substance was more or less infiltrated by it; the'inner surface being nearly white. Dr. M. found similar formations along the large intestine and the edge of the liver, but none upon the abdominal parietes, nor in the organs. There were also six quarts of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. 1857. Dr. John Jeffries.MORBID ANATOMY. 495 The above disease very much resembled that of two children, whom I examined several years ago, except that the structure was more compact.

Firm adhesion of the small intestine at the internal ring, from which it had almost escaped ; with perfect strangula- tion in the recent state. From a man, set. sixty-five. On the 18th of May, strangulation of an old hernia came on, without any violent symptoms, and on the third and fourth day the tumor dis- appeared. He, however, gradually got worse, with great uneasiness and occasional retching, and on the 26th he was seen by Dr. C. He was then in a collapsed state, and vomited at long intervals a thin “ stercoraceous ” fluid; abdomen tympanitic, and he had had no free dej. since the attack. On the 28th he died. Dr. C. thought the case remarkable from the fact of the continuance of the strangulation after the apparent reduc- tion and from its slow progress. 1859. Dr. H. G. Clark. 2357-8. Thibert’s models.

The patient was fifty-one 3rears of age, of intemperate habits, and had been .ruptured since the year 1844. In Sept., 1853, strangulation occurred, followed by slough- ing ; and from that time the faeces were discharged alto- gether at the groin. In June, 1854, Dr. J. commenced a series of operations upon him, the result of which was an improvement, and finally an entire closure of the open- ing in the intestine, though there was an occasional dis- charge of pus until the last; a small cavity being found, on dissection, in the integument. The hernia was inguinal, and involved the intestine497 MORBID ANATOMY. about 20 in. from the caecum. The ileum extended about 14 in. below Poupart’s ligament, and then doubled sharply upon itself. The canal seemed quite free, though it con- tained a few grape-seeds; and neither upon the external nor upon the internal surface was there the slightest ap- pearance of a cicatrix. Toward the cul-de-sac, however, a band traversed a portion of the calibre of the intestine, two or three lines in width midway, but broader at each end, and covered by mucous membrane. The upper por- tion of the intestine is larger than the lower; and just above the junction of the two, the upper sends off some- thing like a diverticulum about § in. in length, closely ad- herent to the intestine, and of a white opaque color exter- nally, though without thickening or induration. Whether this was a true diverticulum, that may have had something to do with the descent of the intestine, is uncertain. 1867. Dr. J. S. Jones. 2361.

A man, set. forty-four, had an old, partially adherent, intestinal, scrotal hernia and, as if to prevent any further descent of it, there was stretched across the cavity of the pelvis a strong, defined band, 3£ in. in length and one and one-half lines in diameter; one end of it being attached to the large intestine just where it enters the pelvis, and the 32MORBID ANATOMY. 498 other to the mesentery of the ileum about where it entered the hernial sac. And this was the only peritoneal adhesion that existed. The very means, however, used to oppose the hernia, caused, at last, the patient’s death, by produc- ing an internal strangulation of the intestine; several similar attacks having previously occurred, as so often happens where a permanent cause exists. In the preparation the band only has been preserved, with a small portion of intestine at one end and of mesen- tery at the other. 1863. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2366. Photograph of an old man who was the subject of a large ventral hernia. Eight or ten j^ears before his death he had extensive suppuration in the front of the abdomen, and it continued for several years. For the last three or four years the contents of the abdomen had been protrud- ing, until the mass became “ larger than a ham,” occu- pying nearly the whole space from the pubes to the costal cartilages, “ wagging up and down during respiration,” and covered so thinly that the motion of the intestines ■was plainly seen.

The liverMORBID ANATOMY. 499 was large ancl fatty, and there was a pint of thin blood in the peritoneal cavity. Other injuries were also found. 1864. Museum Fund. 2369. An abscess in the right lobe of the liver, about three inches in diameter; filled, in the recent state, with a dirty brown, and very offensive liquid, coated with a dirty-white lymph, and at one point threatening to burst into the peritoneal cavity. The organ was generally of a dull red color, but blackish about the cavity. No gall-bladder was seen ; but the hepatic duct contained a very large calculus (No. 2403), and in the ducts within the liver were some minute ones. From a hard-working man, set. forty-eight, who had been always subject to attacks of bilious vomiting, but otherwise health}'-. Being unwell at the time, in conse- quence of a local injury, he was attacked with feverish symptoms, and sharp pain, with tenderness about the liver, followed by a pain in the right shoulder, chills, and heat, diminished appetite, and occasional nausea, skin dry and hot, or bathed in perspiration. After the nineteenth day, the skin, etc., were colored by bile; and during the last two days there was a very marked failure, with dul- ness on percussion and absence of respiration over the lower back part of the right lung. To explain this last, there was found more than a quart of offensive purulent serum in the pleural cavity, with lymph. The whole dura- tion of the acute symptoms was thirty days, and they led Dr. A. to a correct diagnosis of the case. (Med. Jour. Vol. liii. p. 232.) 1855. Dr. Zdbdiel B. Adams. 2370. An abscess in the substance of the organ, about 2 in. in diameter. The disease was supposed to be of about six weeks’ duration, and for some time there had been an external opening just below the sternum, but without jaundice. From a sailor, who had been on the coast-of Africa. There was a profuse discharge of offensive pus; and he finally died from an opening into the peritoneal cavity. 1868* Dr. J. W.

The organ weighed 5 lbs. 10 oz., and contained great num- bers of recent abscesses, from the size of a pea to that of a peach-stone, and giving it, in some parts, quite a honey- comb appearance. The spleen weighed 2 lbs. 3 oz., and in it were large gangrenous abscesses. There were also acute peritonitis and sloughing of the stump. 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 2372. The greater part of the liver, showing a cavity that held, • by estimate, four pints of thick pus; the interior being being thinly coated with opaque lymph. From a man, set. forty-eight, who came from England in Sept., 1867 ; went directly to Chicago, and eight days afterward was taken sick. His symptoms were diarrhoea, and constant pain in the epigastrium, with chilliness and general pains at first, and a considerable loss of flesh and strength. Entered the hospital Dec. 5th (276, 52), having recently arrived from the West, and kept his bed, most of the time until his death, which occurred on the 26th of January. There were tenderness, very severe pain, and extensive dulness on percussion in the region of the liver; and fulness in the right half of the epigastric region ; but there was no fever nor yellowness of the surface. Anteriorly the abscess had approached very near to the surface of the liver ; and, superiorly, the diaphragm formed the parietes to the extent of two or three inches, and bulged into the pericardial sac. This last was coated with fibrine, and contained about two pints of fluid; and in the right pleural cavity was a pint of serum. Otherwise, the liver was healthy, except a commencing abscess about one and one-half inches in diameter, and not far from the large one. (Med. Jour., Ma}^ 14th, 1868.) 1868. Dr. C. Dllis. 2373.

It resembles three specimens (Nos. 1459-61) that were examined at the Fort Pitt Museum, near London, in 1851, as perfectly as if it were from the same subject. In the catalogue of that Museum, the liver is described as having a peculiar cribriform or honeycombed appearance, from small cavities in its sub- stance ; the cavities not lined by a membrane, and con- tained no fluid ; structure soft and homogeneous, and had, in the recent state, a bluish or leaden hue; disease of the liver not suspected during life. — From Mr. John Arthur, of the University of Edinburgh. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2380. Peculiar disease of the liver, from a little boy, set. six years, who had had ascites, drowsiness, etc., for some months. (Hospital, 237, 128.) The organ weighed two pounds ten ounces. “ Of an olive-brown color, through which ran irregular white lines of fibrous tissue. Very firm, and required considerable force to make an incision. Externally studded with small granulations, which were less marked on cut surface; but, on pressure, the latter was seen to be studded with minute502 MORBID ANATOMY. granulations, evidently resulting from the pressure of the fibrous material upon the soft hepatic substance.” The spleen was much enlarged. 1863. Dr. C. Ellis. 2381. Syphilitic disease of the liver. Several opaque, yellowish- white compact masses were found in the substance of the organ, perfectly defined, uniform in appearance, and from half an inch in diameter to the size of a hen’s egg. The liver was rather large and quite firm; acini remark- ably distinct; and upon the anterior surface were several depressed cicatrices about four or five lines in diameter and in depth. There was also disease of the dura mater, brain, and kidneys, which Dr. T. supposed to be of a syphilitic character. From a man, set. forty-nine, who had syphilis tweifiy-six years before his death, and subsequently various secondary manifestations of the disease.

In structure they were whitish, opaque, very generally soft, and in the centre completely broken down. Some yellow, xanthoid material, and some effused blood. Intervening substance healthy. Weight of the organ 3 pounds 6£ ounces. The stomach was also very extensively cancerous. The patient, a man aet. sixty-nine years, had had diarrhoea for nearly two years, had done no work for nine months, and failed rapidly the last few weeks. There had been frequent nausea, occasional vomiting, and toward the last with much distress. In October he was seen casually by Dr. J. F. Wakefield, of South Malden, and by whom the organs were presented; there being then great503 MORBID ANATOMY. uneasiness at the epigastrium, with oedema of the lower extremities. Dec. 23d, Dr. W. was called to him profession- ally, and found sufficient evidence of malignant disease. The liver was very distinctly felt, and had a stony hardness, with dulness on percussion. There was nausea, such that scarcely a teaspoonful of water could be retained; great pain on pressure over the epigastrium; some jaundice, with great oedema and dyspnoea ; and he died on the 27th. The d}rspnoea may have been connected with a large effu- sion of serum that was found in the pericardium. 1869. Museum Fund. Three Thibert’s models. 1849. Dr. J. Ware. 2383.

A portion of the liver, containing echinococci. — From a man, set. twenty-four years, who died at the hospital, of phthisis (202, 211). “ Upon the convex surface of the organ, near the right edge, was a low, yellow, fluctuating protuberance, more than an inch in diameter, and surrounded by a zone of delicate, pink blood-vessels. On incision, there escaped a slightly opaque fluid, which had filled a syst about 1£ in. in diameter. On further examination, there was found, closely attached to the healthy substance of the liver, a thin, bluish-white membrane, within which was a second, nearly white, quite brittle, about half a line in thickness, and which fell away from the first, and lay in wrinkles at the bottom of the cavity. Upon its inner surface were an extremely thin layer of brown, pulpy matter, and many small prominences. No secondary cysts were seen.” “ With the microscope, numerous booklets of the echi- nococci were detached in the fluid above mentioned; and in the pulpy layer the animals themselves were found in • large numbers, mingled with scattered booklets and fat-504 MORBID ANATOMY. globules. The white, brittle membrane presented a finely striated appearance, as if made up of concentric layers. Neai the cyst, and in the substance of the liver, was a small effusion of blood.” In the preparation the thick opaque cyst that contained the booklets is shown, and to some extent the thin outer membrane.

Dr. Amos B. Bancroft, of'Chelsea. 2399. Gall-bladder, with the ducts, and a portion of the intes- tine ; in spirit. Ihe parietes of the first are diseased. The cystic duct, in the recent state, when cut open, measured at the largest part, ljin. transversely ; the hepatic If in. ; and the com- mon duct 2 in. ; but this last contracted gradually to its natural size, before it opened into the intestine. Upon the inner surface of the intestine, and commencing J in. from506 MORBID ANATOMY. the pylorus, is a defined and recent ulcer, 1^ by f in. in extent, and corresponding to an adhesion that existed be- tween the intestine and the dilated hepatic duct. In the gall-bladder and ducts were about .a dessert-spoonful of small, round, smooth calculi. The patient was a large, fine-looking man, forty-nine years of age, who had been subject to colic. Five weeks before death he had an attack of pain across the upper part of the abdomen, followed by jaundice ; kept his bed for a few days, but was soon about his business. Nine days before his death he was attacked in the street with violent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The nau- sea soon subsided, but he had pain in paroxysms, with ten- derness till the last. During the last five days he had hemorrhage from the bowels, and under this he sank. The small intestine contained blood ; and from the ulcer in the duodenum there hung off a large coagulum. (See Arner. Jour, of Med. Sc., July, 1852.) 1852. Dr. John Homans, Sen. The ulceration of the duodenum, in the above case, when there was none upon the inner surface of the hepatic duct, is interesting in connection with a case of aneurism of the arch of the aorta in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet (No. 373), and in which the inner surface of the oesophagus is ulcera- ated, but that of the sac is not; and with an aneurism of the arch of the aorta, that is figured by Cruveilhier (liv. 3, pi. 4) that burst into the oesophagus, and in which the inner surface of the trachea is ulcerated, but the corre- sponding part of the sac is not. The ulceration does not go on continuously from the diseased surface, or commence upon the inner surface of the cavity that contains some- thing that is to be> got rid of, but it commences, indepen- dently, upon the healthy inner surface of the canal, into which an opening is to take place. 2400. Opening between the gall-bladder and duodenum, suffi- ciently large to admit the fore-finger; besides a smaller one. The two organs are firmly adherent, and the gall- bladder is much contracted and thickened. The opening had recently given issue to a large gall-stone (No. 2405) that was found in the ileum, one foot above the ctecum;MORBID ANATOMY. 507 several ineffectual attempts at a passage having previ- ously been made. From a woman, set. forty-three years. In 1856 she com- plained frequently of distress at the epigastrium. Jan. 17th, 1857, she had violent colic, with much retching and vomiting, but was relieved in a few hours. On the 26th of Jan., the 5th of March, and the 29th of April, she had similar attacks, and each was more severe than the pre- ceding. On the 2d of May the pain was relieved by ether- ization ; five copious, thin, yellow discharges followed, with much prostration, and she died the next morning. There was no jaundice. (Med. Jour. Yol. lvi. p. 367.) 1858. Dr. G. EUis. 2401. Gall-bladder opening into the duodenum, 3 in. from the pylorus. The organ, which was firmly adherent to the in- testine and to the colon, was contracted, thickened, looked upon the inner surface like an old tuberculous cavity, and was distended with blood, the source of which last was not found. The opening into the intestine was about mid- way between the fundus and the neck, and was perhaps two lines in diameter. In the cavity of the organ was a large gall-stone (No. 2402) ; and the cystic duct seemed to have been obliterated. From a woman, set. sixty-five years, who had been well until the 1st of March, when she had an attack of bilious vomiting ; followed by deep jaundice, which continued un- til her death on the 9th of July. There was also pain in the hypochondria; nausea, thirst, a burning sensation in the epigastrium, and an irregular, knobby feel to the edge of the liver. (Hospital, 197, 206 ; and Med. Jour. Vol. lii. p. 498.) 1855. Dr. G. Ellis. III. Biliary Calculi. Many of these specimens have faded, more or less, since they were collected, from exposure to the light, so that their color will not often be referred to. 2402. A calculus, 1£ in. long, oval, and finely granulated upon surface. (See No. 2401.) 1855. Dr. G. Ellis.MORBID ANATOMY. 508 2403. A calculus, from the hepatic duct, 2 in. in length, and 8 or 10 lines in diameter. (See No. 2369.) 1855. Dr. Z. B. Adams. 2404. A calculus, about £ in. in diameter, and with marked fagettes, that was taken from the duct just within its open- ing into the intestine. The ducts generally were dilated, and the gall-bladder nearly obliterated. The patient was a woman, fortj^-three years of age, who had been under the care of Dr. D. D. Thayer, and subject for about twent}' years to attacks of pain, that were relieved by vomiting; these attacks being perhaps owing to the passage of calculi, as the present specimen was the only one found, and its form showed that there must have been others. The orifice of the duct also readity allowed the passage of a common blow-pipe. In Nov., 1866, she was taken more sick, and never again did any work, though not confined entirely to the house. Through the winter she had frequent chills and heat. Pain in the epigastrium, and extending to the region of the gall-bladder, was from the first, and so long as she lived, a constant and often severe symptom. In January, 1867, she became jaun- diced, and remained so ever afterward, and sometimes very deeply so. In Feb., 1868, she had epistaxis for three weeks, that threatened her life ; and in Nov., 1868, another severe attack that proved fatal about the fifth day. No trace of coagulum was found on dissection ; but the blood was very thin and pale, and a portion of it that was re- moved in a phial showed on the following da}r a yellow serum onl}', with a small amount of l’ed sediment. The tendency to hemorrhage has been shown in many other cases of jaundice that have occurred here, and in not a few has been the cause of death. In regard to the calculus, it was thought that it may have passed down into the common duct in Nov., 1866, as there was never after that time any one great change in the course of the biliary symptoms. 1S68. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2405. A dark-brown and nodular calculus,more than an inchin diameter. It passed into the intestine, and caused fatal obstruction. (See No. 2400.) 1858. Dr. C. Ellis.MORBID ANATOMY. 509 2406. A gall-stone from the ileum, about a foot from the csecal valve. It is of a dark-brown color, about 1£ in. in length, an inch in diameter, and worn, as b}^ attrition, at one extremity. In Oct., 1866, Dr. Buckingham saw the patient, with pain in the epigastrium, tenderness along the lower edge of the liver, nausea, and diarrhoea; and, a week before, there had been excessive pain in the same region, with yellow- ness of the skin. Twenty years before he had had an attack that was thought to be connected with a biliary cal- culus. April 24th, 1867, the spermatic vein was tied for varicocele by another physician; and on the 27th he died. A few inches from the gall-stone there was a diverticu- lum : and opposite to this last, upon the inner surface of the intestine, an irregular ulcer. The gall-bladder was destroyed ; and, corresponding to it, an irregular, discol- ored opening from the duodenum, about £ in. in diameter. In connection with the recent operation, there was found recent, though not extensive, peritonitis. 1868. Dr. C. W. Swan. 2407. A calculus, that is broken upon one side, but was origi- nally of a cylindrical form, about § in. by from f in. to 1 in.; very marked fa^ette upon each end. From a woman, set. sixty-six years, who discharged the calculus from the bowels, after an attack of severe colic, vomiting, great constipation, and collapse. This was the only attack she ever had ; and fourteen years afterward she was in excellent health. 1860. Dr. E. II. Clapp, of Wrentham. 2408. A barrel-shaped calculus, 1£ in. by 1* in. ; light-colored, remarkably compact, and smooth upon the surface. — From a lady, over eighty-two j-ears old, who was suddenly at- tacked with severe pain in the epigastric region, followed b3r nausea and vomiting. The symptoms continued for six days, but gradually diminished ; and on the 7tli the calcu- lus was passed from the bowels, with two or three smaller ones, and with very severe pain. Convalescence rapid. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxvi. p. 452.) 1862. Dr. Francis Collamore, of Pembroke.510 MORBID ANATOMY. 2409. A mass nearly as large as the last joint of the thumb, and consisting, apparently, of a fusion of several cal- culi. It was passed from the bowels by a patient, who was seen by Dr. S. in consultation with Dr. David S.

From a woman, over seventy years of age, who walked out a few days before her death, and was supposed to have died of old age. The liver, however, was much enlarged, and contained a great amount of encephaloid disease; .neither this nor the gall-stones having been suspected. 1869. Dr. J. B. Little, of Jamaica Plain. 2413. Forty-two calculi; generally about three lines in diame- ter ; color, grayish. From a woman who committed suicide.

Found by Dr. J. C. White to consist wholly of cholesterine, but that it required a little more oxygen to produce crystallization. From a lady, aet. fifty, who died of apoplexy, and had had symptoms of the passage of a gall-stone four or five years before, with an occasional bilious attack afterward. 1862. Dr. Geo. IF. Pierce, of Leominster. 2416. Section of an ovoid calculus, 1£ in. in length; highly crystalline, and must consist mainly of cholesterine. (See Iso. 2391.) 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. 241/. A very unusual form of calculus. “Composed,” ac- cording to Dr. White, “ mostly of cholesterine, with some fatty acids, and a trace of inorganic matter. Colored be- tween crystalline plates by inspissated bile.” It is of a rounded form, and nearly half an inch in diameter. On section, it is somewhat radiated in structure ; and the con- trast between the brownish-red portion, and the white and brilliantly crystalline plates is very striking. The exterior is everywhere irregular, and curiously reticulated by the plates, which are quite prominent above the surface; the intervening and depressed portions being of a brown color, and the whole dull in appearance as compared with the brilliant interior. 1869. Dr. J. S. Jones. 2418. A compact, light-colored calculus, of a somewhat cylin- drical form, smooth upon the surface, or coarsely gran- ulated, and measuring 1£ in. by 1 in. It filled the gall- bladder, and no other disease was found. From a lady, aet. sixty-two, who had been dyspeptic for many years, with much uneasiness in the region of the gall-bladder, and occasional yellowness of the surface. When Dr. S. saw her, two years before death, there was a tumor in the region of the gall-bladder, with tenderness there; and he diagnosticated a disease of that organ. Became at last extremely emaciated, feeble, and sallow. L)r. D. II. Storer. 2419. A very dark, pear-shaped calculus, 1§ in. in length, and 1 in. in diameter at its large extremity.

The gall-bladder was filled with the calculi, and contained nothing else excepting a white mucus. 1864. Dr. G. J. Arnold, of Roxbury. The number of cases in which biliary calculi have been found in females, rather than males, and particularly in fleshy subjects, has been quite remarkable. Their latency, also, has been very frequently observed here, as else- where. 2448. A very large collection of biliary calculi, pretty uniformly about 1 to 3 lines in diameter, and measuring alto- gether giiss. — From a female, set. eighty-two, who had disease of the heart. The gall-bladder was 6 in. in length, the same in circumference, and contained much bile, be- sides the calculi, some of which last were just within the cystic duct. There had been nausea and vomiting the last two weeks, but no cardiac symptoms. 1869. Dr. John Homans. 2449. Calculi, discharged from the umbilicus. The patient was a woman, eighty years of age, and had had a burning sensation in the right side for six or seven years, with thick and very fetid urine; but her general health was good. In Dec., 1868, a severe pain came on over the liver, and continued about three weeks. About two weeks afterward, a tumor of some size appeared over the gall-bladder, without pain ; and about the 1 st of March it opened at the umbilicus, and discharged a calculus. From that time one or two calculi were discharged every two or three days, until the 23d of October, when, after516 MORBID ANATOMY. severe pain for three clays, eight calculi were discharged at once ; and none have been seen since, though the opening remains. The calculi were about the size of a common pea, and generally angular. The friends think that the number altogether may have been a hundred. Since the spring, when Dr. D. first saw her, her general condition has been comfortable, but failing. Stomach and bowels well, except for about two or three weeks in Sept., when her appetite failed, and the dej. were claj’-colorcd. Burn- ing sensation in right side relieved since the discharge of the calculi. As has been observed in similar cases, there was no discharge of bile with the calculi. — (See Med.

Laceration across the organ, to the depth of ^ to ^ in. There was a large effusion of blood about it, but none in the bladder. From a man who jumped from a railroad car, when it was in motion, and lived about forty-eight hours after the accident. (Hospital, 65, 96.) 1855. Dr. G. Ellis. 2452. Encysted disease of the kidney. Both organs were much enlarged, so as to be very conspicuous when the abdomen was first opened, and had a cparsely granular, colorless, and almost gelatiniform appearance. The organ has been cut open, and there is seen to be no trace of the cortical or tubular portions. The cysts are generally one or two lines in diameter, but some would have held from one to four fluid ounces ; the517 MORBID ANATOMY. fluid was generally clear, but in some of the larger cjrsts rather dark and turbid. Pelvis and infundibula rather small,'and did not communicate with any of the cysts. Cysts were also found in the liver. The other kidney is in the Cabinet of the Society for Medical Improvement, — No. 589. From a young man, nineteen years of age, who always had great thirst, and passed large quantities of urine, so that the disease of the kidneys, it was thought, might have been congenital. (See No. 2455.) During the last mouth the respiration was hurried and panting; and two weeks before his death, when he was first seen by his physician (Dr. John Ware), dyspnoea was the most prominent symp- tom. His countenance was then pale, and had sometimes a deathly aspect. There were also pains in the limbs, pal- pitation, cough, and at last cerebral symptoms. The urine was copious, clear, frothy, of a light-straw color, and mod- erately coagulable. Dr. Ware attributed the peculiar respiration to the de- terioration of the blood,' and this last to the disturbed function of the kidneys. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2453. A second specimen, entire. Weight, when recent, 26 oz., and length, 12 in. It seemed to be a complete trans- formation ; the cj^sts varying in size, and the thin fluid within them being more or less colored. The other organ, which was about as large, having been cut through, showed, besides the cysts, several large cavities which were nearly filled with a white substance, like soft putty, and much resembling the material occasionally found in the kidneys and other parts, as the result of “ tubercular ” disease. This substance was found bjr Dr. Bacon to contain pus globules, epithelium cells, much fatty matter, and, he thought, tubercular corpuscles. The ureter of this second kidney was obliterated near its origin. The urine, taken from the bladder after death, Dr. B. found to be turbid and faintly acid; density, 1.018. Proportion of urea very small; and as the urine had not become ammoniacal by standing, but little urea could have been destroyed by decomposition. Albumen in moderately large amount. From a man who had suffered for some months, and as it518 MORBID ANATOMY. was thought, from an affection of the liver; the kidneys not having been suspected. (Aruer. Jour, of Med. Sc. April, 1854.) 1854. Dr. E. Leigh, of Townsend. 2454. A kidney, consisting of a collection of cysts, from £ in. to more than an inch in diameter. It is between 4 and 5 in. in length, very irregular in its outline, much shrunken ; and, though not cut open, feels as if there might be a great deal of tough fibrous tissue with the cysts. The parietes of a number of the cysts in the recent state were quite stiff, like parchment, and some portions were com- pletely ossified ; of a bluish color externally, and con- tained, apparently, a thin serous fluid. From a little girl, set. twelve years, who had always been sickly, but without any urinary symptoms. — For the other kidney see No. 2476. (Med. Jour. Vol. liv. p. 402.) 1856. Dr. C. D. Homans. Cruveilhier has figured a very similar specimen (Anat. Path. liv. 6, pi. 4.), and regarded the disease as con- genital. 2455. An encysted kidney, from a monstrosity (No. 846) ; pre- served entire, and perfectly resembled, externally, the other, which was fully examined. This last weighed 6 oz., was deeply lobulated upon the surface, though no investing membrane could be detached, and contained throughout immense numbers of cysts, about one-half of a line in di- ameter. The ureter consisted of a whitish, condensed, impervious cord, not a line in diameter; and the pelvis was merely an enlargement of the same tissue. Internally no trace of the natural structure of the organ was visible to the naked eye. The following microscopical examina- tion was made by Dr. Jeffries Wyman: “ Ihere weie only traces of the natural structure of the kidney. A few uriniferous tubes, with their epithelial linings, were seen, but no unequivocal Malpighian bodies, though there were some rounded masses covered by a capsule that might have been such. No connection was traced between the cysts and the uriniferous tubes. The contents of the cysts con- sisted of a transparent fluid, in which were floating numer- ous rounded cells, with a central nucleus similar to thoseMORBID ANATOMY. 519 figured in Jones and Sieveking’s Pathological Anatomy (Am. Ed. 1854), p. 555, fig. 254, a. In one of the cysts an octohedral crystal, probably of oxalate of lime, was found.” The bladder was tolerably developed. 1862. Dr. T. E. Francis, of Brookline.

The right kidney is immensely en- • larged, and very thin ; and though the mucous surface had formed a great quantitj'- of pus, it is in every respect almost perfectly healthy in appearance. The patient was a milkman, set. thirty-three years, and had considered himself as well until ten weeks before his death, when he gave up his work. On the fourth day Dr. H. was called, and found him with typhoidal symptoms, pain in the right hypochondrium, and a hard tumor that filled the whole right side of the abdomen, and extended 3 iu; beyond the median line, so that he was as large as a woman in the seventh month of pregnancy. The tumor was not tender, and the patient knew nothing of its exist- ence. In two weeks there appeared to be pneumonia upon the right side, but during the fifth week he seemed fairly convalescent. Severe rigors then came on, with loss of strength ; the tumor began to soften ; and this went on until the beginning of the seventh week, when fluctuation was fairly established. It was then punctured, and two quarts of pus were drawn of; one pint being discharged daily for about two weeks, when it materially lessened. With this discharge there was neither pain nor soreness. In a few days he began to expectorate from §ij. to iv. of pus daily; and, in three weeks after the opening of the tumor, he died. An opening through the diaphragm allowed the pus to pass from the kidney into the right pleural cavity; the quantity of fluid in the chest and abdomen amounting altogether to six quarts. There was also extensive and recent peritonitis. The right lung was compressed, but the other organs were healthy. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxii. p. 124.) Dr. Jacob Hayes, of Charlestoivn. 2463. Infundibula of the kidney dilated into cavities about 2 in.521 MORBID ANATOMY. in diameter. Two of these contain calculi; and the surface of one of these last is for the most part covered with a fibrinous substance that may have resulted from a for- mer effusion of blood. In the pelvis, which is not dilated, is a third calculus, about 2£ in. in length, £ in. in diam- eter, and sending branches into the infundibula. Each of these calculi adhered closely to the mucous surface, though to a small extent, and so caused a dilatation of the organ, bj' preventing the flow of the urine. From a large, fleshy man, tet. fifty-eight years, who died of apoplexy. Intemperate in regard to eating and drinking. Disease of the kidne3rs had not been suspected ; but, after his death, his wife reported that he had long been subject to pain in the loins, and some incontinence of urine. A portion of one of the calculi was found by Dr. Bacon to be composed of the oxide of lime, phosphate of lime, phosphate of magnesia, and organic coloring matter; no uric acid nor urates. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2464. Calculi in the bladder, kidneys, and ureters. The patient was a man, aged thirty-seven years, who had had urinary symptoms for twelve years, and under- went lithotomy in 1862. In June, 1868, he entered the hospital (138, 48), greatly reduced, and died in a few days. Pain severe; and the urine, which was passed every ten or fifteen minutes, was loaded with pus. The right kidney was greatly enlarged, and the left sacculated. In the pelvis of each was a calculus, about 3 in. in length, and f in. or more in diameter; also in the right ten, and in the left five calculi, about f to f in. in diameter. One small calculus was also found in the left ureter, and two in the right. The calculus in the bladder was oblong, flat, and smooth, 2 J in. in length, and If in. in width. They are all of a yellowish color, and consist, according to Dr. White’s analysis, of about equal parts of oxalate, and phosphate of lime, with a little carb. of lime. In the preparation the organs have been dried, and the calculi are shown in situ. 1868. Dr. B. M. Hodges.522 MORBID ANATOMY. 2465. A kidney, ulcerated, but rather less extensively than No. 2467 ; and containing, within it, an irregular white calculus. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2466. The left kidney, reduced to a dense mass of fibrous and adipose tissue, so that its outlines are only faintty trace- able. In the remains of its cavity is a compact, yellowish white calculus, an inch or more in length, and about I in. in diameter; and, connected with this, undoubtedly, though the connection was not fully traced, is a fistula that opened upon the surface of the body. From a woman, set. forty-five years, who fell down stairs thirteen years before her death, and had pain in her side from that time. Three years before death the pain increased ; an abscess formed between the last rib and the ilium, was opened, and a fistula ever afterward remained. There was much pain, and it was thought that dead bone was felt; but no bone was found either dead or denuded, and it was probably the calculus that was felt. (Hospital, 78, 242.) 1859. Dr. C.

Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 2485. Immense distention of the bladder. From a woman, set. forty-five years, and of robust health. About five years before her death she was examined for a tumor of a few months’ duration, and that was supposed to be an encysted ovary. For three or four years she had occasionally had slight dysuria, but no further symptoms until two weeks before death, when, after a retention for twenty-four or thirty-six hours, the catheter was passed with much difficulty, and about half a pint of quite healthy urine was drawn off. From that time her distress was very great and constant. The urine was passed only in the lithotomy position, and with great pain and straining ; for the last three days it was strongly ammoniacal, but it never contained mucus, pus, nor blood. I he bladder, which was the “ tumor ” felt during life, rose to about two inches above the umbilicus, pushing the peritoneum before it, and contained more than four quarts of dark-brown and intensely ammoniacal urine. The parietes were dense, but not thickened, and the inner sur- face a little roughened, but without any trace of inflam-MORBID ANATOjNIY. 526 matory product; a very striking appearance being a pretty uniform brownish and greenish discoloration of the mu- cous surface, as occasionally seen in the intestines. The muscular fasciculi were not visibly enlarged; and the ureters were not dilated. In the substance of the fundus and body of the uterus and on the left side, is a defined, fibrous tumor, about four or five inches in diameter; and in the left side of the neck a second, of an oval form, about a third as large; the uterus being apparently pushed to- wards the right side. The smallest of these tumors, which is preserved with the bladder, is quite dense, and pos- sibly may have occasioned the distention of the bladder. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxiv. p. 251). 1861. Dr. C. II. Walker, of Chelsea. 2486. Mould in plaster of the interior of the bladder, and of two hernial protrusions of the mucous membrane.

Sacculated bladder.— From a gentleman, mt. sixty-three • years, who, for the last twenty years, had had frequent and difficult micturition, with pain and uneasiness in the lower part of the abdomen. Symptoms much increased toward the last, but he finally died of typhoid fever. The organ filled the wdiole pelvis, extended as high as the umbilicus, and contained about 2£ quarts of urine. The proper bladder was very much enlarged, thickened, and the muscular fibres strongly developed. At the fundus and toward the left side was an orifice about 1£ in. in diameter, and leading to a sac that was considerably larger than the bladder itself. This sac, which contained the greater part of the urine, was quite thick, and the muscular coat well marked, showing that it was not a mere hernia of the mucuous membrane. The prostate gland was much enlarged, chiefly in the centre, with a band from side to side, as usually seen. The ureters and pelvis were dilated, but the kidneys were healthy. (Med. Jour. Vol. lvi. p. 343.) 1857. Dr. C. D. Homans. 2488.

Mucous surface uowliere smooth, and in many parts covered with shreds, and rough eleva- tions from the thickening of the submucous"coat. The sac is, perhaps, half as large again as the bladder itself; and the opening between the two is from two to three inches in diameter. The left ureter opens into the sac, half an inch from the bladder, and is considerably dilated, as is also the pelvis of the kidney, which contains a dark, irregular calculus. From a hostler, set. thirty-five years, who had had dys- uria for a month or more before he applied for medical ad- 'ICC> Pain iu tl3e region of the kidneys was severe, with tenderness over the bladder, and occasional retching and vomiting; and he died not long afterward of peritonitis. , Dr. M. M. Hodges. Calculus in the bladder in situ. (See No. 2464.) 2489. A tumor projecting into the cavity, and from the fundus the bladder, is perfectly defined, of a circular form, about 4 in. in diameter and 2 in. in elevation; the mucous membrane stopping abruptly around the base. It had a dead-white color, a fibrinous consistence, and consider- able friability, so that it had been broken into in some places by handling. The external surface was rouo-h, but the general form rounded. In structure it was uniform, nowhere at all vascular, and showed nowhere any of the usual appearances of cancer. Under the miscroscope, Di- Ellis found no cancer cells, nor, indeed, any definite ap- pearances. Not very far from the tumor was a white deposit in or beneath the mucous membrane, and about a me in diameter; and otherwise the bladder appeared quite healthy being neither fasciculated nor remarkable as o is size. Upon the peritoneal surface, corresponding to the tumor, there was no appearance of morbid deposit. e patient was a shoemaker, of good general health, and fifty years of age. When first seen by Dr. C., about two years before his death, he had had frequent and irre- sistible calls to urinate for about eight years, and until f aS i^°?e?1S tPis llacI been the only symptom ; but, afterward he had had considerable pain during micturition with constant uneasiness, and sometimes a smarting, cut-528 MORBID ANATOMY. ting pain along the urethra and in the glans. The urine, then, and so long as he lived, averaged about two quarts daity, was often bloody, and sometimes offensive. The blood was often in clots, and during the last few months he lost a great deal, with much straining and distress; a pound or more being sometimes passed daily and for several daj^s. The urine always contained blood, albumen, pus, large quantities of mucus and of epithelial scales, casts of tubes, and sometimes oxalate of lime. The pas- sage of a sound caused veiy acute pain along the urethra, and especially at the prostate. When first seen there was some constitutional affection ; and for about a year before his death there was a decided failure of his health, though he worked at his trade until the last seven months. (Med. Jour. Vol. lx. p. 203.) 1859. Dr. Benj. Cox, Jr., Salem. 2490. Cancer of the bladder. In the recent state the organ was contracted, and a well- marked encephaloid growth arose from its inner surface, posteriorly, in the form of soft, luxuriant, polypiform vegetations; the disease was between 2 and 3 in. in extent, pretty well defined, and rose above the surround- ings surface about one-half or two-thirds of an inch. Othei'- wise the bladder was healthy, excepting a discoloration of the inner surface, and a slight deposit, apparently from the urine. The ureters and pelves were dilated, and there was some acute inflammation of one of the kidneys; but there was no cancer in any other part of the body. In the head nothing was found but a little serous effusion. From a woman, set. sixty-two years, who entered the hospital, Dec. 23d, 1856 (210, 32), and reported, as fol- lows : Two and a half years previously she had ridden two hundred miles in the cars, in the course of nine hours, and within a few hours, if not immediately on her arrival, had hsematuria; this symptom continued for three weeks. Ardor urinse was quite severe at first, but had not been present for the last three months. There had been also soreness, and a sense of weakness of late about the hjqpo- gastrium; but very little if any marked pain ever in the bladder. There had been slight pain in the region of the529 MORBID ANATOMY. kidneys for the last few days; also, incontinence of urine, complete during the night and nearly so in the day, for the last two months. The urine had been pale and offensive for the last three months. The patient gave up work when the disease commenced, but was not confined to the house. She retained considerable flesh and strength, but was pale; and, her complexion being naturally dark,* she had the hue that is so often observed in cases of cancer. On examination, the bladder was found to bulge into the vagina, and to have a thickened, fleshy, but not firm feel, as. from a mass of soft vegetations, in its cavity. The urine was sufficient in quantity, but was very pale, exceed- ing^ offensive, contained a great deal of pus, and had the density only of 1.011; a catheter that was passed became at once very deeply discolored. Jan. 6th. —The patient became dull; and from the fol- lowing day until the 10th, when she died, she was almost entirely unconscious,-breathing about eight times in a minute, but without convulsion or any sign of distress Some of the interesting points in tiffs case are,-the long journey, as an exciting cause of the disease, —the occurrence of hemorrhage as the first symptom, as it some- times is in phthisis, — the very mild character of the symp- toms, considering the usual irritability of the bladder the feel of the bladder, —and the mode of death, as’ in .Bright s disease, and in connection with which the low specific gravity of the urine is to be remembered. (Med. Jour. Vol. lv. p. 526.) 1857. I he “peculiar hue of cancer” is often wanting in this t isease, as it is often enough met with in other cases; and it may not unfrequently be explained as the effect of pal- lor upon a naturally dark complexion. 9TQi Jackson. - - The posterior portion of the bladder, showing an openino- through into the vagina or uterus, and large enough to admit the last joint of the fore-flnger. - From a ease of 2432 VnTo "'°rab- 1855- Dr' J■ B- S- 2492; Villons oanoer. - In the recent state, the bladder was 4 in n t lameter; ,ts walls being half an inch in thickness, and the flbies of the muscular coat much hypertrophied. Upon530 MORBID ANATOMY. many parts of the inner surface were small, dirty-white patches of lymph, some of them roughened by a deposit of salts, from the urine. Rising from one-fourth to one- half of an inch above the surface, just within and a little to the right of the meatus, was a soft, highly vascular vil- lous growth, 3 in. long, and from an inch and a half to 2 in. wide. The vessels were parallel to the villi, which were very distinct, and in water presented very much the same appearance as the villosities of the chorion. The disease was confined to the surface, and resembled soft encepha- loid. The microscopic characters were those of villous cancer ; namety, villi and large cells of various shapes and sizes, — some of them containing large nuclei and nucleoli. The left kidney and ureter were inflamed, and both ureters were dilated. From a healthy farmer, set. forty-five years. For ten years he had complained of his back, and for four years of an occasional burning and throbbing in the urethra after micturition. During the last five months he had passed blood with his urine. Occasionally, during micturition, there was such a pressure downward as to cause involun- tary discharges from the bowels ; there being a difficulty both of passing, and of retaining the urine. Between two and three months before death, he passed from the urethra white bodies, of the size of a common bean. When first seen, seven weeks before his death, he complained chiefly of his back, and the burning in the urethra, but his gener- al appearance was healthy. Ten days afterward Dr. Bacon found the urine turbid, colored by blood, alkaline from car- bonate of ammonia; density, 1.013. There was a large deposit, composed chiefly of whitish ropy mucus, with blood corpuscles and phosphates, and a few pus globules, granular exudation corpuscles, and epithelial cells. The mucus was probably in part a result of the decomposition of pus by the alkaline urine. Considerable albumen was found, which was due to the blood and pus present. Fail- ure gradual, with vomiting and irritability of the bowels the last week. (Med. Jour. Vol. lv. p. 311.) 1857. Dr. C. Ellis.531 MORBID ANATOMY. 2493. Extensive cancerous disease of the bladder, and of a peculiar form. There projects from the lower half of the posterior wall a fungous, lobulated growth, about the size of an English walnut. In the recent state the cavity of the organ was not more than 3 in. in diameter, and empty. The verumontanum, with the prostate gland and neigh- boring tissues are also affected. The rectum was involved ; the pelvis was mostly filled with a morbid growth; the lumbar glands were most extensively diseased, and there v as disease of one of the lower ribs. The growths every- where were of considerable consistence; of a dull or yel- lowish vhite color; here and there vascular or ecchymosed, and contained much milky fluid. On mici oscopic examination, there were seen many gran- ular nuclei of the size of, or smaller than, blood globules. Some contained large nucleoli, but most were without them. A few nuclei, with large, well-marked nucleoli, were here and there seen ; but, with these exceptions, there was noth- ing Tvhich could by any one be considered as characteristic of cancer. From a literary gentleman, sixty-six years of age. In May, 185G, he asked advice for difficulty of defecation; and, on examination, a tumor in the region of the prostate was found pressing in upon the rectum. A tumor was also felt, extending 2 in. above the pubes. For the first two months there was much pain, but afterward none at all. Micturition throughout very frequent. Became extremely emaciated, and died Dec. 29th; having had no dej. for two weeks, and having passed no urine for three days. (Med. Jour. Vol. lv. p. 512.) 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. III.

A smooth stone, £ in. by about a in., removed from the bladder, by the forceps, and found by Dr. Bacon to be a “rolled pebble of argillaceous rock;” four or five others having been removed within a few weeks. From a respectable married woman, about thirty-five years of age, and whose propensities, otherwise, were in no way remarkable, so far as was known. She had been practisingMORBID ANATOMY. 532 the deception for one or two years; with very severe pain, and a constant desire to urinate ; much blood and muco- purulent matter being mixed with the urine, which was very offensive. She indignantly denied the charge of hav- ing introduced the stones, as usual; but at last acknowl- edged the fact, and assigned as a reason, an intention of suicide. (Med. Jour. Yol. lx. p. 78.) 1859. 2495. A lead pencil, removed from the bladder of an unmarried woman, thirt}r years of age. The two halves were separa- ted in the bladder, and separately removed. 1869. Dr. J.

The patient was an unmarried woman, about thirty-eight years of age, and professed to have used it to relieve her- self of dysuria. It was in the bladder about twelve hours, and caused no great irritation. 1863. Dr. E. 31. Hodges. 2497. Two pieces of gutta-percha bougies, removed from the urethra by perineal section. The patient was forty-five years of age, and had been in the habit of passing bougies of his own manufacture. One of the pieces had been broken off four months, and the other two days, before he entered the hospital (118, 203). On the eleventh dajr no urine escaped from the wound ; and in two weeks he was discharged. One of the pieces is coated with phosphatic deposits. The bougie, from which a piece had been recently broken, is shown with this last. 1865. Dr. E. 31. Hodges. 2498. A portion of gum-elastic catheter, 9 in. in length, re- moved from the bladder. — The patient was a laborer, set. forty, who was injured by a bank of earth falling upon him, and for sixteen days was obliged to have the catheter used daily. The instrument was at last broken off, but nothing was done about it, as he was told that it would melt and come away.

About six weeks after the original in- jury, the bladder was injected with warm water, and the catheter removed by means of a lithotrite, there being a considerable deposit of the salts of the urine upon it. 1868. Dr. II. G. Clark. * IV. Calculi. One hundred and twenty-three of the following speci- mens were sent to Harvard University, from England, in the year 1800, by Dr. John Nichols ; and, as the Medical School then existed, and they were undoubtedly intended for its use, they will be entered as a donation to the Muse- um. Not man)'- years ago they were removed from Cam- bridge to the Medical College. In 1856 they were exam- ined by Dr. James C. White ; and the results were given in a tabular form, with some remarks, in the Med. Jour. (Vol. liv. p. 459). Since then one of the specimens has unfortunately been lost. Forty-eight other specimens were already in the Muse- um when it was presented to the College by Dr. J. C. War- ren ; and these were analyzed by Dr. White, in 1858, and the results published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lix. p. 329), in tabular form, and with extended remarks upon the for- mation of calculi. In both cases Dr. W. used the micro- scope, as being much more exact than the test tube. In the Nichols collection he says: “In each case the entire smface of a section through the centre has been carefully and equally scraped ; by which means we not only obtain all the constituent parts, but their relative proportions also. In the Warren collection he says: “ In every in- stance the nucleus and each layer have been separately examined, etc. In his second article Dr. White gives the following tables, — the four first in reference to Dr. War- len s collection, and the two last to show the result of the analysis of both collections :534 MORBID ANATOMY « U Table I.

Removed from the bladder after death. The patient was an old man, seventy-eight years bf age, who had been under the care of Dr. J. Homans, Sen., and who had great dysuria for a short time, six years before his death. After this subsided he had as good health as most persons of his age, until the last eight months, when the disease returned, so that he was confined to his house; the urine being small in amount, and the character unnatural. The pain, however, was only moderate in amount; and he died at last from a slight cause. The bladder was thickened and contracted about the calculus. 1867. Dr. J.

A material that looks not unlike the fragments of a cal- culus, that bad been broken up by a litbotrite, and in bulk about four fluid-drachms. From a gentleman who was first seen by Dr. G. about a year and a half ago. Two and a half years previously be passed about a teaspoonful of fine red sand after con- siderable pain. After this be was relieved for a time ; but in a few weeks be began to have discomfort in passing tbe urine, and for tbe next two years this went on, gradually increasing. When Dr. G. saw him, be was passing bis urine every hour, or oftener, during tbe nigbt, and perhaps every fifteen minutes during tbe day; and always with great pain. Just before this time, a catheter having been passed, it was found almost impossible to withdraw it. Tbe obstruction was without doubt owing to tbe calculi; and, when it was at last withdrawn, tbe pain was excruci- ating. There was some loss of flesh, and of tbe appetite, but tbe patient’s general appearance was sufficiently well. Tbe urine bad generally been fetid, and bad a dirty look ; and once or twice some blood bad been passed. On passing an instrument there was felt something like tbe remains of a disintegrated calculus, or as if it were passing into a sandy beach. A series of operations was then commenced for the removal of the fragments. A very large and per- fectly straight catheter, that was made for tbe purpose, and with a very large eye, was passed two or three times a week for several weeks. Tbe bladder was always first in- jected with tepid water ; tbe instrument was then passed ; and, on withdrawing the stoker, more or less of the frag- ments were forcibly discharged. Since the last of them were got rid of, the relief has been complete, though a catheter has always been required. Tbe fragments that have been preserved, are not quite one-lialf of tbe whole amount that was passed. Most of them are very irregular, like bits of dried mortar, and on an average smaller than a dried pea. Many were smooth, rounded, and sometimes hollow ; and many were surrounded by a secondary deposit. When recent, they were generally lemon-colored, and several of them still have a yellowish543 MORBID ANATOMY. or buff tint, but otherwise the}'' are grayish or clay-col- ored, from having been in a bottle containing an alkali. Analyzed by Dr. D. H. Hayden, and found to consist of the ur. of ammonia, with a trace of triple phosphate. 1870. Dr. G. H. Gay. 2561. A calculus, with fragments, removed by Dr. Clark. From a young man, eighteen years old, from Provi- dence, R. I., and who entered the hospital March 2d, 1868 (135, 76). “Bladder always weak,” but had suffered severely for the last five months. Urinated every hour or two, with a scalding pain afterwards from the neck of the bladder to the end of the penis. The stream would some- times stop abruptly, and then commence again. Great pain in the bladder on active exercise ; less when up than in bed, and most when on the back or right side. On examination of the urine, it was found ammoniacal, alka- line, with a small amount of albumen, a very abundant, white, ropy sediment, and an immense number of pus cor- puscles, and crystals of triple phosphate. On the 7th the operation was performed ; and, the stone being large, it was necessary to break it up somewhat, and to cut the prostate, right and left. The bladder felt quite hard and contracted. On the 13th, fragments continued to come away, on syringing the wound. On the 24th, urine passed through the urethra for the first time. April 10th he was up and walking about; and on the 3d of July he left the hospital, with a fistulous opening not quite closed, and occasionally a slight discharge of urine from the wound. rLhe stone is of a flattened, oval form, and measures upon the cut surface about 1J by 1^ in. Structure, com- pact. A small nucleus of uric acid is surrounded by lay- eis of ox. of lime; followed by a la}7er of triple phosph., about vV on broad, and this by layers of the ox. of lime, with a small quantity of uric acid; this last portion con- stituting the largest portion of the calculus. Surface cov- ered with a highly laminated deposit of phosphate of lime, and the fragments consist of the same, with some coloring matter. The surface of the stone, exposed to a considera- ble extent, is of a pinkish color, and finely granulated.MORBID ANATOMY. 544 Weight of the stone and fragments, when first removed, 13 dr. 2 sc. and 4 gr., Troy.— The analysis was made by Dr. D.

Lithotomy was performed January 23d, 1868, and he left the hospital well, March 7th (107, 4). The external appearance of the calculi was very nearly the same ; about lj by 1 in.; form somewhat triangular, flattened, and with the angles quite rounded ; surface smooth, and of a yellowish color; one, on section, is for the most part dark, very irregular in structure, and with something like a central cavity ; cortex, £ to £ in. thick, is 'white and compact.

Hodges. 2618. A calculus that distended the pelvis of the left kidney, and extended into the infundibula and calices ; so that its . irregular form suggests the idea of some kinds of coral. Weight 1 oz., and diameters about 2J by 1J in. Extrem- ities of some of the branches cup-shaped, so as to receive other calculi or the papillae of the pyramids. Surface rough, and fawn-colored. In the other kidney were several small calculi. Of these last, of which the largest are shown, one or two are about as large as the tip of the finger; one is irregularly covered over with large, sharp ciystals, and another partially with the same. Around the calculi there was a puriform fluid, and the renal substance was grangrenous. The same fluid was found in the ureters and bladder ; and the mucous membrane of this last was dis- eased. The third lobe of the prostate also was enlarged ; the membranous portion of the urethra showed the results of old inflammation, with contraction of the canal and fis- tuloe, of which one opened externally. — Dr. White found the large calculus to consist of urate of ammonia in large amount, uric acid in small amount, carb. of lime, phosph. of lime, and triple phosph. of ammonia and magnesia. The large and peculiar crystals upon the surface of a portion of the large calculus, and that seem to entirely compose two of the small calculi, are ox. of lime. The patient, who had been under the care of Dr. J. S. Green, of Dorchester, was a carpenter, sixty-six years of a<m, who had had dysuria, with failure of the health, for six years.

Vol. lxxvii. p. 330.) 1867. Dr. J. Homans. 2619. Calculus, removed by the lateral operation. The patient was a little boy, six and a half years old, who had always resided in Boston, and had had symptoms of stone for four years. The operation was performed April 20th, 1857. The urine did not pass wholly through the urethra until the 9th of May, at which time the wound was fairly cicatrized. On the 26th, without assignable cause, the wound opened, and urine began to pass through a fistulous orifice, which, by report, was preceded by a little boil. There was no sur- rounding inflammation. Although the urine passed freely by the urethra, and only by drops through the fistula, it was not until June 9th that this last was obliterated by re- peated applications of nitrate of silver. The stone was oval, flattened, g- in. in length, and weighed eighty-two grains. The following is the result of Dr. Bacon’s analysis ; the powder removed in sawing the calculus, and a few crystals from the outside being examined : “ The constituents are, — oxalate of lime, phosphate of lime, triple phosphate and carbonate of lime ; with small proportions of urate of ammonia, urate of soda and uric acid. Comparing the analysis with the appearance of the section, it is evident that the nucleus and several surrounding layers consist of oxalate of lime chiefly. The outer layers are mostly com- posed of earthy phosphates. Small crystals of oxalate of lime cover the exterior. This deposition of oxalate of lime upon earthy phosphates is an interesting point in the structure of the calculus.” 1858. Dr. R. M. Hodges. The next nineteen specimens were given in 1800, by Dr. J.

(Hospital, 79, 94 ; and Med. Jour. Vol. i,vm. p. 362.) —The patient was thirty-two years of age, and from the western part of this State. “ For five weeks preceding her last confinement, two years and seven months before entrance, she had painful micturition for the first time in her life. Her labor lasted seven days, and the physicians in attendance attributed * the delay to the presence of a stone in the bladder. The child was delivered without instruments. In ten days she was up and about the house, and for five ueeks had no trouble. She then began to have offensive and thick puru- lent urine ; and, finally, at the end of seven weeks, took to her bed from inability to walk about or sit down. She was confined to it for eleven months, and during this period passed calculi from the bladder, sometimes as many as four at a time, and varying from the size of a pea to that of a walnut. She had passed none for a year. A catheter detected the existence of a calculus, and, on examination per vaginam, a large vesico-vaginal fistula was found, ad- mitting the finger, which came in immediate contact with the calculus. The vagina and inside of the bladder felt rough to the finger, like sand-paper, from the deposit of phosphates. A pair of lithotomy forceps, introduced through this aperture, crushed a very soft stone, and five drachms of fragments were removed. Great relief followed the operation.” The calculus was found by Dr. White to consist of the triple phosph., phosph. of lime, and ur. of ammonia. “ The laminae are arranged in an irregular, concentric manner, and are mostly made up of large, loosely arranged crystals of triple phosphate, undoubtedly a hasty and secondary559 MORBID ANATOMY. formation, depending upon inflammation produced by the fistula.” 1858.

From a mechanic, of this city, set. fifty-one, who had severe urinary symptoms, and had had them, more or less, as long as he could remember. In 1858 a large calculus was lemoved. Oct. 25th, 1859, another stone was felt by Di. B., and on the 25th of Feb. the operation was per- foimed. The calculus broke, and the specimen here shown foimed the nucleus ; about a teaspoonful of fragments be- ing also scooped out. The patient finally did well. (Hos- pital, 87, 6.) 1860. Dr. II. J.

A rough, dark-brown calculus, 2 J lines or more, in diam., and passed from the urethra. From a man, about thirty-two years of age, who had “bilious fever” in Aug. and Sept., 1866, and that lasted for ffve weeks. This was followed by attacks of pain in the stomach, umbilicus, pubic or right iliac regions, with retraction of the scrotum, but not of the testicle; some- times preceded by pain in the lower part of the spine ; oc- casionally with priapism ; and always followed by a sense of constriction to the right of the pubes, extending down the right side of the penis, and into the thigh. In March, 1867, he went abroad, and had no trouble except an occa- sional sense of constriction about the pubes. About the first of July, after his return, and whilst feeling perfectly well, the uneasiness in the pubic region returned, with fre- quent desire to urinate, and very slight hematuria, and in the night the calculus was passed. Examined by Dr. J. C. White, and found to consist of the ox. of lime. 1867. Dr. C. Ellis. 2666. Urethral calculus, about 3 by 5 lines; dark, very hard, and somewhat irregular.

Fiom a man, about seventy-five years of age, who had had perineal fistula for some weeks, and, when Dr. C. first saw him, an infiltration of urine. Incisions were made; and m the course of four or five operations, subsequently, the calculi here shown, with many more, were removed from somewhere, as it seemed, anterior to the bladder. The fistula then closed, and the patient did well. Dr. D. PI. Hayden analyzed the calculi, and found them to consist of the ox. of lime. 1870. Dr. II. G. ClarJc. 2670. Spherical.

Intelligen- cer, March 2d, 1824, by Dr. J. Lummus, of Lynn. — For two years the patient had had pain in each side, and par- ticularly in the left; but, until a few weeks before her death, nursed a young infant, and attended to her domestic du- ties. Ten -days before death Dr. L. found her prostrated, greatly emaciated, and with a distinct, hard, unyielding tumor in the seat of the pain. “ All the viscera seemed healthy, except the kidneys. The left ureter was impervi- ous ; the right I was prevented from examining. I re- moved the tumor on the left side, weighing 4 lbs.; con- taining the kidney, thickened peritoneum, and a calculus weighing 19 oz., avoirdupois ; an end of it broken, and presented a smooth fracture ; another calculus weighing ^ oz., and six others, weighing together g oz. The calcu- lus in the right side I felt through the thickened peritone- um ; and I judged it was but little smaller than that of the left; I was not allowed to remove it. The body of the large calculus is of an ovoid form, and upon one side regular in its outline. From the other side there project five masses, more or less pedunculated, as usually seen in renal calculi, and varying from the bulk of a chestnut to that of a pullet’s egg. The color is whitish, and the surface rough. Weight, 1 lb., l£ oz. Diameters of the body of the calculus, 5£ in., 2fg in., and 2fe in. The small'calculi weigh 1J- oz.; vary much inform, and in size, from about £ in. to 1J in. in diameter. In 1858 the specimen was examined by Dr. J. Bacon: “ The portion analyzed was from one of the external nod- ules, which presented, on section, numerous concentric layers, mostly of a yellowish-white color. A friable nucle- us composed of ox. of lime, with a very little phosph. of lime, occupied the centre. Around this was a series o hard layers, consisting of phosph. of lime, chiefly; witt a little ox. of lime, triple phosph. and carb. of lime. T outer layers, of a nearly white color, and rather fna e, were composed of phosph. of lime, with considerable tripleMORBID ANATOMY. 563 phosph. and a little carb. of lime.

Calculi, passed from the urethra. The patient was a single woman, set. fifty-five years, and severely troubled by lheumatism for about sixteen years. For about a year sh'e had had uneasiness in the region of the bladder, with increased turbidity of the urine ; there having been a mu- cous deposit for some time before. These symptoms in- creased, and about the last of July the calculi were passed at once, and without pain. For a few weeks previously she had kept her bed, but her health afterward improved, and the urine became nearly free from mucus. Dr. White found the calculi to consist, principally, of phosphate of lime, with the ox. and carb. 1868. Dr. James S. Greene, of Milton. 2679. Fragments of a calculus, with fine debris, from a case of lithotrity; and amounting altogether, in bulk, to about 3vij. The patient, a man aet. thirty-eight years, entered the hospital July 26th, 1869 (140, 218); had had symptoms of disease for four years, and was constantly getting worse. ^ Pain in the bladder, and especially after micturi- tion. Urine passed frequently ; and with a sudden stoppage ol the flow, when he strained violently. On admission, there was a dull pain in the bladder most of the time ; very severe pam in the end of the penis after micturition ; and an occasional mucous sediment. A stone was felt, and on the 28th it was crushed by Dr. Id. ; the operation being followed by chills. Aug. 9th, a second operation; but nothing of any amount came away. A severe chill fol- lowed, and the man died on the 12th ; a fine sand having been passing more or less every day from the time of the first operation. The bladder was contracted into a firm ball, of a dark ash color, upon the inner surface, and contained fragments of the calculus; but these last were mostly in a pouch, that was anterior to the prostate gland, and ulcerated upon the inner surface.564 MORBID ANATOMY. Composition of the calculus, according to Dr. White: phosph. of lime chiefly, with some ox. of lime, and a trace of triple phosph. of ammonia and magnesia. 18G9. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2680. A large ovoid calculus, and another much smaller; re- moved from a sac in front of the bladder. The patient, a laborer, thirty-three years of age, had stricture nine years before, and that was relieved b} dila- tation ; but from that time he had been in the habit of passing, occasionally, an elastic catheter (about No. o). Nov. 5th there was difficulty of micturition, and a small swelling appeared in the perineum. On the 7th, after a cold ride, the swelling became painful, and from that time increased. On the 14tli he was seen by Dr. J. Spalding, of Lowell. The swelling was then larger than the fist, and the whole scrotum and penis were infiltrated with urine. On the right side there was a urinary fistula, that had existed foi nine years, and upon the left side the cicatrix of one that had healed. The bladder was not distended; and every hour or two the man drew off a considerable quantity of urine by the catheter ; the flow being quite free when the instrument was passed down to near the membranous por- tion of the urethra, and it being evident that it did not enter the bladder. The strength and pulse were fair. An incision along the raphe, and just below the scrotum, was followed by a gush of about §iij. of urine ; and the cellular tissue was found extensively gangrenous. The calculus was then felt firmly imbedded in fibrous tissue; and, the anterior wall of the sac in which it lay being incised, it was with considerable difficulty separated from the walls and withdrawn. At least a pint of urine immediately escaped. A fagette, showing that there was a second cal- culus this last was felt and easily removed. The largest calculus measured 6* in. in its largest, and 4£ in. in its smallest circumference; diameters of cut surface, I4 m. by H in. Weight, 740 grs., Troy. Structure compact; and of a light-yellowish color. Distinctly, though no strongly, laminated upon the cut surface; the laminae being darker than the rest, and quite hard. External surfaceMORBID ANATOMY. 565 generally granulated; but at one extremity there is a smooth, highly polished, and concave surface, being the fagette above referred to, and at the other a smooth but convex surface, which was explained by the frequent pas- sage of the catheter. The smaller calculus, of which one- half only is preserved, measures -if in. in length upon the cut surface, and must have been somewhat pyriform in shape. The nucleus was ox. of lime ; color the same as the largest, and the external surface was granulated. The larger calculus consisted mainly of the phosph. and carb. of lime (bone earth), with a considerable mixture of ox. of lime, as shown in the laminae. Analyzed by Dr. D. H. Haj^den. In a note, dated Feb. 7th, 1870, Dr. G. says that after the operation, all of the gangrenous tissue came away, and the wound granulated rapidly ; elastic catheters being kept in the bladder for some weeks. About a month ago a small stone was felt in the situation of the former one ; very friable; and the fragments, that were removed, not equalling in size a cherry-stone. The man is now in better health than for several years, and able to work. A small fistula remains in the perineum, through which all of the urine passes ; but he can retain it for five hours; the stream is of full size, and he only suffers during its evacu- ation from this mode of passing it. There is still, how- evei, another stone that can be felt by passing a probe into the fistula 4 or 5 in., and that is to be removed by operation. I ebruary 22d, Dr. G. presented the fragments of this last, which were removed on the 20th. They were con- tained in an irregular sacculated cavity, and weigh, now that they are dry, one hundred and twenty grains. 1870. Dr. J. Orne Green. 2681.

H., who sent the specimen, with a full history of the case, to Dr. Bigelow, was consulted, and found her in a most distressing and loathsome condition ; greatly re- duced in flesh and strength, and confined to the bed, which was saturated with urine. On pressure over the bladder, a stream of urine, with mucus, could be forced upward 6 in. from the fistula in the groin. Vagina, and external surface for some distance much inflamed, and very sensi- tive. The calculus was perfectly immovable, under the arch of the pubes, and seemed to occupy the greater part of the pelvic cavity. Feb. 25th, 1861, an attempt was made, under ether, to remove it, when it broke, and the large mass was easily extracted. The small calculus was then felt in the bladder; and, the finger being passed through the dilated urethra, it was removed; there being no other opening between the bladder and the vagina. After the operation the inflammation very soon subsided, the fistula had closed on the ninth da3r, and on the twenty- third day she walked three-fourths of a mile without in- convenience ; and the following November she was quite fleshy, in perfect health, and entirely relieved of her former troubles.

Some exhibit indis- tinct concentric layers, but no crystalline structure occurs in anjr. On chemical analysis, by Dr. Bacon, they are composed of silicic acid chiefly ; with a little animal mat- ter, partly fat; a little chloride of potassium, and traces of other potash and soda salts. Boiling nitric acid slowly penetrates the calculi, and dissolves out the organic and saline matters, rendering them translucent. After this treatment, they retain the original form and hardness ; and when washed and dried are quite white, and consist of pure amorphous silex. The specimens in the tube-vial exhib- ited have been thus treated. — Traces of silex occur in the normal urine of the ox and various other animals, and have also been found in that of man ; but genuine siliceous calculi are of exceedingly rare occurrence.” 1857.

It is slightly tuberculated, and is mostly covered b}^ a thin, smooth crust, like a glaze. This has a peculiar semi- metallic or iridescent lustre, and is made up of several very thin laminae. The interior, so far as exposed, is com- posed of thicker layers, of a whitish color. “ Portions from the shining crust, and from layers near the surface, were analyzed. They consist of carbonate of lime chiefly, with silicic acid, phosphate of lime, and or- ganic matter. The silica forms the principal constituent of some of the laminae, and is not found in others.” 1860. Dr. J. H. Blake, of N. Auburn, Me. In the Med. Jour.

The largest bone con- tains seventeen teeth, and the smallest thirteen; and they are arranged in each in two compact groups.MORBID ANATOMY. 575 The sac, which has been distended and dried, shows an extensive cretaceous deposit in the parietes. In the recent state it weighed 2 lbs., and contained 20 lbs. of a dark, thick, chocolate-colored liquid. There was mainly one cyst, but with some divisions. The patient was a single woman, thirty-one years of age; had known of the disease for about ten years, and had been as large as at the ninth month of pregnancy for a year or two. She was generally healthy, had never been tapped, and bore the disease well.

A quantity of hair that was very positively stated to haAe been taken from the urinary bladder ; lying in it quite free, and the organ itself being perfectly healthy. When received it wras in a liquid that wras removed with it, and that resembled a thick mucilage, with a mixture of a sub- stance, that resembled, but was shown by Dr. Bacon not to be fat. The patient, an unmarried woman, sixt}r-two 37ears of age; died of a chronic peritoneal disease, of ten months’ duration, and the bladder had never been suspected. The uterus and its appendages were apparently in a healthy condition.” In the Cabinet of the Soc. for Med. Improvement there is an ovarian sac containing a very large mass of hair ad- herent to its interior. The case was published as one of development of hair in the urinary bladder; and there can be no reasonable doubt that a similar mistake was made in the above case; and, still further, these are probabty not solitary instances. 1869. 2717. Both ovaries encysted and acutely inflamed. From a woman, get. forty, and previously healthy. On the morning after her marriage she had symptoms of se- veie inflammation ; and in three weeks (Nov. 19th) entered the hospital (99, 416) with a firm, painful, tender, fluctuat- ing tumor, that almost filled the left side of the abdomen.576 MORBID ANATOMY. The whole of the right side was tender and tympanitic. Constitutional sj’mptoms grave. One pint of fetid pus was drawn off from the left ovaiy on the 22d ; three and a half pints from the right on the 24th; and on the even- ing of that day she died. Pus, with recent lymph, was found in both cysts. 1862. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 2718. An ovarian cyst, that was supposed to have ruptured several times, and at last filled the peritoneal cavity with a secretion from its inner surface. The patient was unmarried, fifty-four years of age, and had always been quite healthy, though of very sedentary hab- its. About five years before death the catamenia ceased, and she very soon afterward had the first of several attacks which were thought to warrant the above diagnosis. A rounded, hard, smooth tumor would appear in the region of the left ovary, without tenderness or pain, but with a general feeling of indisposition. In the course of a week or two the tumor would suddenly disappear; a soft, dif- fused swelling across the hypogastric region would follow ; and she would almost at once be seized with universal cramp-like pains and retching. The pains were so severe, that she would sometimes fall upon the floor when the attack came on, but in the course of three or four hours they would subside. The retching would continue for about the same time, but with little or no vomiting, and the hypogastric swelling would gradually subside; the whole attack lasting from about two to four weeks. At first the tumor was about the size of a small apple, but it enlarged somewhat with each attack. About three years before death, having altogether had six or seven attacks, the character of which was very sim- ilar, she had the last, and this was by far the most severe. The tumor enlarged to the size of a pint bowl, and it did not burst for two or three months, but the exact time at which the rupture took place was most satisfactorily indi- cated. She was awakened from her sleep by a sensation as if she had been slapped with the hand upon the tumor, and at once this last disappeared. She then awoke her sister, told her the circumstances, and said that she felt as577 MORBID ANATOMY. well as she ever clid. In a few minutes, however, she was •attacked with the usual symptoms, which, as above stated, were more severe than ever before, — the swelling of the abdomen continuing for some weeks. In the autumn of 1857, enlargement of the abdomen commenced without the precursor of an attack, and from that time it went on increasing ; but it was only during the last few months that it would have been noticed when she walked abroad. She lost flesh and a great deal of strength ; but she was able to do some work as a tailoress, was never confined to her bed, and walked out within three or four weeks of her death, which occurred in Dec., 1858. There never was any return of the general pains, and over the abdomen her only complaint was of a sense of weight. Ihe appetite was good to the last, except during °the attacks; bowels generally well; urine scanty and turbid. CEdema of feet for the last two months. An hour or two only before her death she said that she felt very sick, but made no especial complaint, and had then only just left her sitting-room. She was never tapped. On dissection, the peritoneal cavity contained, by esti- mate, six or seven gallons of a very viscid substance, that was compared, at the time, to soft soap. A stout, muscu- lar man, who was in the habit of lifting heavy weights undertook to remove the tub that contained this substance,’ but found it too heavy; and on setting it down, said that he should estimate the weight at 200 lbs. In the place of the left ovary, was a mass of disease that appeared very satisfactorily to consist of a cyst about as large as the two hsts. This cyst had been lacerated throughout the greater pait of its extent; the edges of the laceration apparently cicatrized, and being quite distinct. Its interior was made up of cysts, generally from 2 to 4 lines in diameter ; arid from ^ie ^ung'C°ff a secretion which was somewhat clear, u a ogether too viscid to be removed without great diffi- culty Ihe serous surface of the cyst had, in some parts, a dark-brown discoloration; and, in others, a brilliantly g is cning and silvery appearance, which Dr. Ellis found o e owing to cholesterine.

The tumor weighed 2£ lbs.; but, with the fluid that was removed from it, it was estimated at 8 lbs. It consisted mainly of two or three large cysts, the inner surface of which was everywhere covered with a soft fibrinous sub- stance, mixed with a thick puriform fluid. The appear- ances were suspicious, but “ nothing decidedly cancerous” was found microscopically. (See Med. Jour. Vol. lxx. p. 89. For more than a year the patient was quite well, and gained 40 lbs. of flesh, with disappearance of the ascites and oedema. In the spring of 1865 she was much chilled by exposure to a cold rain, sickened from that time, and died in Jan. 1866. The ascites returned, and she was tapped four times ; for the first time in July, after which a tumor was felt, that proved, on dissection, to be a large and well-marked cancerous development of the right ovary, ■which was healthy at the time of the operation. The ute- rus and other organs were healthy; and the peritoneum much more healthy than at the time of the operation. 1866. . Dr. II. G. Clark. 2723. Fibrous disease of the ovary.

Sept. 25th Dr. S. saw her, and found her in bed, much emaciated, with an anxious countenance, and two distinct, firm, and movable tumors in the lower part of the abdomen, one upon each side of the median lme. There was also ascites. As ballottement was very distinct, he regarded it as a case of pregnancy ; and, having decided upon premature delivery, a sound was passed, and the ute- rus found empty. The diagnosis was then uncertain ; but, upon the presumption of extra-uterine gestation, and with the full'sanction of Dr. J. M. Warren, the tumors were re- moved on the 3d of October by abdominal incision. The operation was done with great ease, and scarcely an ounce of blood was lost. For thirty-six hours the patient did well- but peritonitis then came on, and she died on the third day. (Case published in full, with remarks, in the Med. Jour. Vol. lxi. p. 325.) 1860. Dr. D. H.

The patient was married at the age of nineteen, had one child within the year, and about two or three months after- ward discovered a protrusion of the organ through the vulva. Menstruation gradually became very profuse, and, in the course of three years, she became so reduced that Dr. S. did the operation as a means of saving her life. For the first year her health decidedly improved ; but after a while it began to fail, with symptoms of suppression of the catamenia, and she died five years after the operation, of tubercular disease. Dr. Wm. H. Thajmr, of Keene, N. H., examined the body, and published the result, with a general history of the case, in the Berkshire Med. Jour. (Mass.), Sept., 1861. A portion of the cervix remained ; and the Fallo- pian tubes, that arose from a single point, were entirely obliterated to the extent of a few lines from their origin.

When first seen, two days before the operation, she was perfectly blanched and very weak ; and the globular, inverted organ was felt in the vagina.

The patient, a negress, had her first child in 1835 ; her second in 1838, and two months afterward the tumor pro- truded from the vagina. In 1845 a miscarriage at the fifth month. In 1846 a child was born at the full term, though the tumor was external during the entire term of pregnan- cy and parturition. In 1848 a miscarriage at five months ; and the next year two in the third month. In 1860 she came under Dr. M.’s care, with severe and increasing dysmenorrhcea; the tumor being about three- fourths as large as at the time of operation. After trying various expedients, a linen bag was found to be the most serviceable, and this she ever afterward wore ; any attempt to return the tumor within the vagina causing great dis- tress. During about a third part of each year she was obliged to give up work, keep her bed, and use opiates, etc. Dr. M. intended to remove the protruding mass when menstruation should cease, but it was found impossible to delay the operation, and it was therefore done on the 29th of May, 1861. The protrusion then was from 4£ to 5 in. beyond the labia, and the diameter of the mass about 33- in. ; a catheter passing in 8^ in. Around the os were five large ulcers. The ecraseur and the knife were both used, and the mass was removed about 2g in. from its extremity. The hemorrhage was not great; and after the operation the cut surface, within the vagina, resembled a hollow cone. The patient did quite well, and was soon up and about. Three months after the operation, however, she had a very severe attack, owing to a closure of the uterine canal, and a retention of the catamenia. An opening was made ; and twice afterward it was necessary to repeat the operation. At the date of Dr. M.’s report of the case (Oct. 26th, 1862) the length of the uterine cavity was 4£ in., and the patient was quite comfortable. Menstruation regular ; and ceased about the year 1867, at the age of 60 years. The large size of the os uteri shows how impregnation must have been effected. — Med. Jour. Yol. lxvii. p. 349. />/•.

An abscess in the broad ligament, opening into the ute- rus, and causing death three weeks after labor. This last was natural; but there was hemorrhage before the head descended, and several times subsequently, and under the loss of blood she sank. During the first few days she had pain in the right iliac region, and after the 12th a tumor there; but the indications of disease were very little marked ; and it was thought possible that the disease may have existed before labor. Dr. Cheever, who attended the patient, and sent the specimen to Dr. B., found the abscess upon the right side, and with an opening that would admit the finger half an inch inside of the os uteri. The cavity contained much pus, fresh blood, and was 3 or 4 in. in extent, with other, circumscribed sinuses in the broad ligament, and an infiltration of dense lymph in the sur- rounding cellular tissue.

In March, 1861, her husband was sick, and she nursed himMORBID ANATOMY. 585 constantly for eight weeks. Menstruation at this period ceased on the second or third day; and immediately after- word a tumor appeared quite suddenly above the pubes, with very little local or constitutional disturbance. April 25th Dr. P. saw her, in consultation with Dr. C. D. Cleave- land. The tumor was then of a globular form, about the size of a small foetal head, slightly elastic, and not hard, nor tender on pressure. A soft tumor was felt in the up- per part of the vagina, and upon the back of it the os uteri appeared as a semilunar slit. The appetite was good, and she did not look sick. July 13th there was moie local and constitutional disturbance; the vaginal tumor was about 6 in. in diameter, and more prominent; and, being opened, discharged about gviii. of thick, yel- low, inodorous pus. Aug. 29th the tumor above the pubes like a foot-ball.” Opened per vag., and discharged four quarts of pus, of rather disagreeable odor; the pari- etes of the abscess collapsing so as nearly to efface the cavit}r. From this date the discharge of pus was constant until her death in Nov. 1862 ; menstruation being regular during nearly the whole time. The abscess was very defined and regular; and, though ernpt}7, was capable of holding from one to two pints ; parietes dense; inner surface quite dark and knobbed, and looked as if an adventitious mucous membrane were form- ing; a minute opening, from the puncture, is seen in front of the uterus, which is considerably enlarged.

The patient was an unmarried, light-mulatto woman, ret. thii ty-three years, and resided in the West Indies. In 1856 she had “typhoid fever” twice. During convales- cence from the second attack she was very much frightened by a lunatic, had excessive uterine hemorrhage, and the abdominal tumor was then discovered. From that time she was confined mostly to her bed or a couch, and became greatly reduced in flesh and strength, with nausea and vomiting. Catamenia suppressed at first, but throughout her sickness she had an irregularly recurring menorrhagia,MORBID ANATOMY. 586 with a continuous, excessive, and peculiarly offensive dis- charge. In 1858 she was tapped as for ovarian dropsy. In July, 1860, she arrived in this country, much exhausted. Jan. loth, 1861, she became suddenly worse ; on the 17th she was tapped — the distention being enormous ; and on the 19th she died. The cavity of the abdomen contained about sixty pints of fluid. The tumor, which rose as high as the umbilicus, and adhered to the anterior parietes, was made up of ex- ceedingly delicate cysts, from the size generally of a wal- nut to that of a foetal head, and filled with a gelatinous or thin serous fluid. The uterus is about 4 in. in length, and the tumor arises directly from the fundus; the parietes between its cavity and that of the cysts being as healthy as in any other part, though diminished by one-half in thickness. To a considerable extent the parietes are con- tinued over and gradually lost upon the surface of the cysts ; and in some places small c}rsts are developed in this expanded portion of the uterus. There is no appearance of cancerous disease, nor any fibrous tumors in the womb. Ovaries large, but otherwise not remarkable. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxiv. p. 305.) 1861. Dr. A. W.

The last labor, which occurred in 1850, was preceded by dangerous hemorrhage, as the pla- centa was over the mouth of the womb. From this she recovered well, but some months afterward hemorrhage came on, and continued more or less at intervals until her death in 1854. During the last fifteen months she was under the care of Dr. G., perfectly blanched, and mostly confined to her bed. Examinations always caused hem- orrhage ; but the tumor was never painful nor tender, and caused no sense of bearing-down, nor dysuria, so that the patient was hardly conscious of its presence. The cata- menia were regular, and entirely without pain, though sometimes attended with hemorrhage; the most severe hemorrhages generally occurring a week or two after the flow had ceased. 1857.

A tumor from a married woman, who had had hemorrhage, - at intervals, for four years. Suddenly, and after a long- walk, a dense, heart-shaped, pediculated mass was forced down, so as to protrude externally. A ligature was ap- plied, and on the fourth day it came away; the weight being 2^ lbs. The apex was marked by a smooth circle, and probably due to the pressure of the os uteri. No hemorrhage followed the operation; and, though there was prolapsus of the organ, the patient’s health was greatly improved. The mass looks and feels not unlike the com- mon fibrous tumor of the womb. 1859. Dr. James Ayer. 2752. A tumor, from a woman, set. thirty^, who was in labor with her first child, at the full period, and had had no symptoms of the disease. Dr. C. found the tumor below the child’s head, and it descended with it. After the deliv- ery it remained external to the vulva, and seemed to arise from the whole anterior lip of the uterus. A double lisa- ture was at once passed about it, and it was then cut away ; but, as it bled considerably, a second ligature was used, and the patient then did well. The tumor was about twice as large as a hen’s egg, and resembles a very dense fibroid tumor of the womb. 1856. Dr. B. Cushing. 2753. A tumor, about li| in. in diameter, of a rounded form, and mostly smooth over the surface, but in part torn, and showing the mass to be made up of small, fibrous tu- mors. From a woman, set. forty-six years. The tumor had been pressing down for thirteen years ; and she had had, mean- while, two children and two or three miscarriages. There had been hemorrhage for a week before Dr. S. saw her, but never before; nor had there been an}r return when he reported the case three months after the operation. The tumor was twisted off at the os with the fingers. 1859. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2754. A tumor, larger than the last; of a rounded, and some- what flattened form, and smooth upon the surface; the590 MORBID ANATOMY. peduncle being § in. in diameter, and of a coarse fibrous structure. From a woman, set. foity-one years, who had had one miscarriage and six children. There had been constant pain in the back since the last in 1847, with increased cat- amenial flow from that time, and frequent hemorrhages from 1857 till 1859, when the polypus was removed, and, as in the last case, from within the os. The case, however, was complicated with a tumor in another portion of the organ, and the hemorrhage continued. 1859. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2755. A tumor, 5 in. in length, 10 in. in circumference, and with a pedicle half an inch in diameter. Structure fibrous. From a woman, set. forty-one years, who had had one child, twenty-one years before. Flowing for the last nine years ; chiefly at the menstrual periods, but at other times on exertion ; one quite unusual symptom being an accumu- lation of the coagula between the tumor and the walls of the vagina. Latterly she had been much reduced by the loss of blood, and was confined to her chamber. Dr. Channing passed a ligature by means of Gooch’s canula, and the tumor came off on the fifth day. 1856. Dr. C. G. Putnam. 2756. A polypus, 2 in. in length, 1£ in. across its free extrem- ity, and 1£ in. at the pedicle. Form not unlike that of a pear. The most remarkable peculiarity, and that which constitutes it as belonging to a very rare variety, is the existence of three or four cavities, opening largely upon the free extremity, as in the case of some small sponges, and of which two communicate, though the others are sep- arate ; these cavities resulting from the formation of the polypus, and not from disease. In the recent state it was as large as a goose-egg, of a very deep and rich purple or crimson color, soft to the feel, and thickly covered with very viscid mucus. From a widow, set. forty-four years, who had had several children; and who, for three years, had had a constant discharge of mucus and blood, with pain in the back, and a sense of bearing-down. She had become quite antemic,MORBID ANATOMY. 591 and had been treated by various physicians for prolapsus ; the tumor was at the orifice of the vulva, and the largest cavity felt not unlike the os uteri. Dr. M. at once removed the tumor from the upper part of the cervix, with complete relief; and a year and a half having now elapsed, the pa- tient’s health is quite robust. Dr. M. refers to Scanzoni as having met with and de- scribed a single case of this form of polypus. Dr. Old- ham also describes and figures two specimens, and calls it the channelled polypus. (Guy’s Hospital Reports for 1844, p. 115. — Med. and Surg. Jour., June 11th, 1868.) 1868. Dr. II. A. Martin. 2757. A uterus, from which a polypus had been recently removed. A circular depression is seen upon the inner surface, just above the cervix, quite defined, and about £ in. in diameter. The lower part of the cervix is considerably dilated, and the organ, otherwise, is suffi- cientty well. From a woman, ast. forty years, who entered the hospi- tal April 23d, 1853 (184, 268). She was quite anaemic; having had menorrhagia for about twenty years, following two miscarriages, and frequent hemorrhages for the last two years. A large, soft tumor filled the upper part of the vagina, and a ligature was applied by Dr. J. M. War- ren, on the 10th of June. On the 20th it came away; being 2 in. in length, 1£ in. at the broadest part, and hav- ing a long pedicle. The patient died with inflammatory symptoms on the 2d of July ; and, on dissection, the case was found to be complicated with a large ovarian cyst. 1854. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2758. A firm mass upon the inner surface of the fundus of the uterus ; 1£ in. in diameter, and forming the remains of the pedicle of a polypus, that was removed six months before death. The organ was tubercular, as were the peritoneum, lungs, etc. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxv. p. 474.) 1862. Dr. F. Minot. 2759. Three or four fibrous tumors, about as large as the fist, besides several small ones. The large ones project into the peritoneal cavity, and one of them is to some extent592 MORBID AX ATOMY. entirely broken clown in structure. Cavity of organ not enlarged, and cervix not involved. 1847. . Dr. J. C. Warren. 2760. Several large, dense, pedunculated tumors bang off into • the peritoneal cavity ; and two or three of them, of the size of the fist, are ossified. Cervix and os small. The whole mass weighs 7| lbs. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2761. A fibroid tumor, attached to the external surface of the • organ by a few fibres only, though there were firm old adhesions to the neighboring parts. It is about as large as the two fists, of a regularly ovoid form, and strongly marked fibrous structure, and is shown to have been of long duration, by its opacity, and a certain amount of ossi- fication upon the surface. From a woman, aet. fifty-nine years, who died of cancer. The existence of the tumor was known for twenty years before her death, but it seemed to have given her but little if any trouble. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxi. p. 242.) 1859. Dr. C. D. Homans. 2762. A single tumor, 2£ in. in diameter, and projecting into • the cavity of the womb, which is considerably enlarged; structure flaccid, and imperfectly fibrous. Uterine pari- etes flaccid, and quite thin over the tumor. Neck not in- volved. The specimen resembles very strikingly one of Dr. Baillic’s figures. (PI. III. fig. 2.) 1854. Dr. Charles Gordon. 2763. A tumor, about as large as a marble, and projecting into • the uterine cavity from the fundus. Incision through both. From a negress, set. foi^-five years, who was estimated to weigh 350 lbs. She had had three children, and ten miscarriages; the last time about two years before her death, when, as she said, “ she nearly flowed to death.” 1855. Dr. Wm. E. Toivnsend. 2764. Forty-two tumors, from about \ in. to 2 in. in diameter. There were also two large tumors that were ossified through- out. (Nos. 1308-9 in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet.) From a negress, aet. fifty-nine years; a feeble-mindedMORBID ANATOMY. 593 woman, who had had incontinence of urine, but no other marked symptoms. 1857. Dr. G. L. Collins, of Providence, R. I. 2765. The uterus perfectly buried in tumors, which vary in size generally from 1 to 3 in. One of the largest is in the cervix, and seems to have originally formed in this unu- sual situation. Another of the largest hung freely into the peritoneal cavity; and a third, 2 in. or more in diameter, projects into the cavity of the fundus, with a small pedicle. The uterine cavity is much dilated, but the parietes of the organ are comparatively thin ; and the blood-vessels are enlaied as usual. The whole mass weighs 3 lbs. From a widow, set. forty-six years, who had had profuse menstruation for years, but without much pain; and no other pelvic symptoms. 1861. Dr. C. G. Putnam. 2766. Several small tumors in the womb, which last is much atrophied ; the most interesting point being the formation of a fibrous tumor, about half as large as an English wal- nut, in or rather below the broad ligament, and quite be- yond the limits of the uterus. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2767. A large uterine tumor, that was spontaneously dis- charged. The patient was forty-one years of age ; and being then in her ninth pregnancy, had in May, 1855, a considerable em or i'll age. Sept. 24th Dr. S. was called, and found that she had been flowing for a month. A very firm tumor was felt in the right iliac region, but he was not allowed to make an examination. Dec. 23d the child was born, pre- senting by the bieech, with the head exceedingly com- pressed upon one side, as by the tumor, and weighing 6 bs. 1 he placenta, to some extent, was strongly adherent; and, on separating it, the tumor was distinctly felt. Dur- ing the following night and day she had severe after-pains ; ant forty-eight hours after delivery, the tumor, weighing 2 lbs., was thrown off. Recovery rapid. In May, 1857, she was again delivered of a large, healthy child ; but she recovered slowly, and died the fol- owing January from a large intra-thoracic tumor. In the; 38MORBID ANATOMY. 504 body of the uterus was a fibrous tumor, of the size of a pea, but upon the inner surface nothing peculiar was no- ticed. 1856. Dr. D. II. Storer. 2768. The fundus and body of the womb, considerably enlarged, aud very much elongated by fibrous tumors. Cervix not affected. 1861. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2769. Portion of a tumor, to show the change of structure that may take place after a long while. The patient was eighty-four years of age, and had had swelling of the abdomen for more than thirty years. There is no appearance of fibrous structure to the naked eye, though it is marked enough microscopically; but it is per- fectly white, very flaccid, though tough, moist in appear- ance, and irregular rather than smooth upon the cut sur- face. Altogether it formed a semi-spherical mass, 6 in. in diameter, and 3 in. in thickness; and the convexity was surrounded by a thick, cretaceous covering (No. 2773) — there being no ossification of the substance of the mass. 1852. Dr. Daniel Huntington, of Rochester, Vt. 2770. A single tumor, developed in the fundus of the organ, very defined, of a regular, rounded form, and measuring on the cut surface about 5 in. in diameter. Structure quite dense, for the most part, but with great numbers of small cavities, in which is a cellular tissue, and which last is very soft and relaxed, and, when recent, so infiltrated as to gn e a gelatiniform appearance. The uterus is quite small; and the expansion over the tumor is well shown. From a woman, set. forty-five years, who had known of the tumor for at least five years. During the last year she was as large as at the sixth month of pregnancy ; and died at last worn out by pains. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2771. A tumor in the anterior parietes ; single, perfectly globu- • *lar in form, nearly as large as the fist, very dense, and partially ossified. Uterus elongated, very much as in No. 2768. The subject was about seventy years of age. 1857. Dr. Ii. M. Hodges. 2772. A tumor, If in. in diameter, quite defined, surrounded by a cretaceous shell, and has throughout a dead, opaque,MORBID ANATOMY. 595 dryish, yellowish-white appearance, with some brownish discoloration. It is quite as dense as any fibroid tumor, though the peculiar structure is less marked than usual. As in No. 2769, the tumor had ceased to grow, had degen- erated, and the patient may have lived for many years without any further trouble from it. The ovaries are shown with the uterus. The left has been transformed into a thin, serous cyst, nearly 2£ in. in diameter. The other consists mainty of a collection of cysts, nearly twice the size of an English walnut, and upon which the remains of the atrophied ovary are spread out. From a woman, set. forty-five years, who died of pulmo- nary disease, and had no uterine symptoms. Her last labor occurred six years before her death, and she then had twins. Menstruation was said to have been regular until the last; occasionally very scanty, and, when this was the case, she had hsemoptisis. 1852. Dr. Charles II. Stedman. 2773. Ossific envelope, from the surface of a fibrous tumor. (No. 2769.) 1852. Dr. D. Huntington. 2774. A tumor cut open and dried; and showing cretaceous matter scattered throughout. It was about f in. in diam- eter, and hung off from the fundus into the peritoneal cav- ity by a slender pedicle. In the substance of the body of the organ was a second, smaller tumor, not at all ossified. — From an octogenarian. 1855. Dr. C. Ellis. 2775. Tumor, ossified throughout. A dried section. 1£ in. by liin. 1862. Dr. C. Ellis. 2776. Three irregular, cretaceous masses, and altogether about twice the size of the fist. From a tumor that arose from the posterior portion of the cervix, and weighed 14 lbs. The soft parts, which have been dissected away, had a lax, coarse, fibrous structure. From a lady, aet. sixty-five jmars. The abdomen had been gradually enlarging for about forty years, until the cavity was filled. 1866. Dr. F. F. Tursaith, of Weymouth. 2777. A tumor, hanging by a very marked pedicle from theMORBID ANATOMY. 596 fundus of the uterus, and into tlie peritoneal cavity. About the size of a hen’s egg; and, having been cut open, it shows a complete breaking-down of the substance for the most part, but with the intervening fibrous .structure un- changed. The uterus, otherwise, is healthy. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2778. A tumor, 5 in. in diameter, and attached to the fundus • of the organ. In its substance is a large, and irregular, but perfectly defined cavity, containing portions of the mass, that have been detached apparently by the process of sloughing; these free portions being deeply discolored when recent, though still veiy dense. Several folds of the ileum adhered to the tumor, and one of them opened into its cavity ; and it must have been a rupture of this cavity into that of the peritoneum that caused death. The patient, oet. thirty 3rears, was about as usual, when S3Tmptoms of perforation came on, and she died considera- bly within twenty-four hours ; about two quarts of a thick fluid, and having a strong fiecal odor being found in the peritoneal cavity. (Med. Jour. VoI.lxxiv. p. 425.) 1867. Dr. Wm. Reed. 2779. Uterus, in the posterior parietes of which a large tumor • had become separated from the surrounding substance of the organ, by a process of sloughing, so that it lay there as free as a polypus that had been detached by a ligature. The tumor itself is in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet. (No. 970.) The uterine cavity is cut open, and is seen to be healtlty, though much elongated; and in the parietes of the organ are other fibrous tumors. 1861. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2780. The uterus cut open, and showing a fibrous tumor in the substance of the fundus, about the size of an English wal- nut. This last formed a tumor in the hypogastrium as large as the fist; but, under the use of the bromide of po- tassium, it diminished so that in two months it could not be felt. Three years afterward the patient died of fever. 1866. Dr. II. R. Storer. 2781. A large tumor, mistaken for an encysted ovary, and re- • moved during life. (Hospital, 32, 164.)MOKBID ANATOMY. 597 The patient was a healthy, unmarried woman, set. twenty- seven years. Duration of disease about one year; and growth of tumor rapid the last six months. It extended to the epigastrium, was not painful, seemed to be distinctly lobulated, and had an elastic feel as if encysted. With the full sanction of the surgeons of the hospital, and deter- mination of the patient, Dr. P. removed the tumor, after applying ligatures about what seemed to be the pedicle. A few ounces only of blood were lost; and the patient was quite comfortable until the evening, when she suddenty fell off, and twelve hours after the operation died ; nearly a quart of blood being found in the peritoneal cavity. The tumor weighed nearly 9 lbs.; and, even after re- moval, the sense of fluctuation was such that it was impos- sible to realize, until it had been cut through in different directions, that it was not encysted. This feeling was owin^ to the structure, which, instead of being dense, as in most cases, was soft and compressible, with large meshes, and a very considerable amount of serous infiltration. There was also in the centre of the mass a considerable amount of effused lymph. It arose from the fundus of the womb, and was invested by a thin layer of uterine tissue. The uterus is preserved with the tumor, and is seen to have been cut through near the fundus. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., April, 1848.) 1848. Dr. Samuel Parkman. 2782. The uterus, greatly enlarged by fibrous tumors, and re- moved, successfully, during life; the weight of the mass being 8 lbs. Both of the ovaries are seen ; and the cavity of the uterus is exposed by incision. The patient was forty-seven years of age, and had known of the existence of a tumor for five years. Con- valescence was uninterrupted; and on the thirty-seventh day she returned home, a distance of about four miles. Before the uterus itself was removed, a tumor that was attached to the broad ligament was removed, and that weighed 16 lbs., after thirteen pints of fluid had been drawn from it. * ibis case has been published in the Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., Jan., 1866, with numerous quotations, and a full dis-598 MORBID ANATOMY. cussion of the subject of the removal of the organ. 1866. Dr. Horatio R. Storer. 2783. The greater part of the uterus, with a large fibrous tumor • connected with the fundus ; removed during life. The patient was a widow, fifty-two years of age, who had suffered from the disease, more or less, for nine years, and particularly for the last two. The chief symptom was pain in the pelvis and lower extremities, as from pressure upon the sacral nerves; with partial loss of power and sensibility toward the last. Bowels much constipated, and faeces flattened ; but dysuria not urgent. General health impaired, and for the last two or three months she had scarcely been up. The case was diagnosticated by Dr. C. as one of fibrous tumor of the womb ; and the operation was performed by him in May, 1867, at the earnest solicitation of the pa- tient, and with a full understanding as to the probable result. The mass, here shown, was removed with the ecraseur, and afterwards the other ovary with the same. Seven silver wire ligatures were applied to the vessels, and the actual cautery was also used; §ij. or more, only, of blood being lost during the operation, which lasted about five hours. The patient lived twenty-three hours after the operation, and until the last three or four hours looked as if she might recover. On dissection, no inflammation was found, nor effused blood. The uterus has a rounded, knobbed appearance, and is about the size of the fist; containing numerous fibrous tu- mors, and almost entirely in the anterior parietes. From the fundus there hangs off, and by a long pedicle, a very dense tumor, of which the diameters are 6J, 5£, and 4 inches. The whole mass weighs now 3 lbs. 12J oz. 1869. Dr. Charles M. Carleton, of Norwich, Conn. 2784. A membrane that was expelled from the uterus, and has the appearance of a decidua, excepting its unaccount- able length. One surface is throughout quite smooth, and the other rough; and ill one place at least the characteris- tic punctated appearance is quite marked. To the extent of about 3 in. it is tubular, and probably large enough toMORBID ANATOMY. 599 admit the finger. The width varies at different paits , and the length is 15 in. From an unmarried woman, thirty-eight years of age, who discovered a tumor, about five years ago, upon the right side, half way between the umbilicus and pubes, and about the size of an egg. During the menstrual periods there has always been great flowing, but without pain, and, since the tumor was first known, with three exceptions, a membranous discharge at each period ; the length of the membrane varying from 6 to 24 in. The woman has the appearance of full health, and the tumor, which is in the right side of the abdomen, and extends rather beyond the median line, is of a rounded form, dense to the feel, and apparently about 6 in. in diameter. Microscopically, Dr. J. Collins Warren found the mem- brane transparent, filled with spindle-shaped cells, and perforated with holes; with villi thickly attached to the rough surface. 1870. Dr. C. E. Buckinfjham. 2785. Tubercular disease of the inner surface of the body and fundus of the womb; cervix, as usual, not affected. From a woman, ®t. twenty-nine years, who was exten- sively tubercular. 1855. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2786. Scirrhus of the womb. The os and cervix are destroyed, with the whole upper part of the vagina ; ulcerated surface dense. No cancerous disease elsewhere. The patient was thirty-nine years of age, had had the disease for a year or more, and the case was remarkable for the entire absence of pain. (Med. Jour. Yol. xlv. p. 394.) 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2787. Encephaloid disease. — Organ cut open, and shows a de- struction of the os, cervix, and great part of the body; with some superficial ulceration of the vagina, resulting from the irritating discharge, and a threatening of rupture into the peritoneal cavity. An encephaloid mass, about the size of a nutmeg, is also seen to project into the blad- der, which, though small, is otherwise healthy. The appen- dages of the uterus are adherent; and tlie ureters (No. 2481) were dilated. As usual in cancer of the womb, the other organs were not affected.600 MORBID ANATOMY. From a married woman, ast. thirty-two years, who entered the hospital April 14th, 1851, and died Nov. 28th (169, 154). Duration of the disease uncertain, as she had been out of health for three or four years. Leucorrhcea for some years ; with a constant and offensive discharge whilst she was in the hospital. The “ catamenia,” which had previously been regular, was very profuse, and present during more than half the time, for about ten months pre- ceding Feb. 1851, but afterward became scanty. Much pain ; and especially during defecation, though no dysuria. Became very pallid, and much reduced, with universal ana- sarca for some months before death. (Amer. Jour, of Med.

After several ineffect- ual attempts with forceps, etc., Dr. T. removed it with a corkscrew, as he would a cork from a bottle. It had been in the vagina for about an hour, and no inflammation resulted. 1852. Dr. Wm. E. Townsend. 2790. Wound of the vagina by a hay-hook (No. 3116). The bladder and intestine were also wounded ; and, the per- forations not having closed, a glass rod has been passed through, and indicates the course of the hook. 1857. Dr. J. P. Maynard, of Dedham. 2791. A superficial, lacerated wound of the nympha, that, in the recent state, was 14 or 2 in. in length, with some extrava- sation of blood into the surrounding tissues. The vagina was perhaps also lacerated near the meatus ; but it was thought that the parts may have been cut during their removal. From a healthy woman, in the seventh month of preg- nancy, who was found by Dr. A. lying upon the floor, in aMORBID ANATOMY. 601 pool of blood, and immediately after falling from a bed upon which she had been standing; there being no certain evidence that she struck anything as she fell, though the post of a crib was suspected. All efforts to arrest the bleeding were of no avail, and she died in about three- quarters of an hour. The above is only one of several cases that have been reported to the Soc. for Med. Improvement, of violent hemorrhage in case of wounds of the external genital organs during pregnancy. 1851. Dr. Z. B. Adams, of Framingham. 2792. A large and continuous portion of “ epithelium,” dis- charged from the vagina. The patient, who had been under the care of Dr. J. T. G-. Nichols, of Cambridge, was a servant girl, set. twenty-six years, who had had a moder- ate leucorrhoeal discharge for some time ; and profuse men- struation, though regular, and with very little pain. The membrane was thrown off toward the close of a menstrual period ; and there had been similar discharges previously. Dr. J. Wyman. 2793. Bodies discharged from the vagina, and that look very much, in regard to form, as if they might be casts of the cavity of the fundus and body of an enlarged uterus. They are about 2J to 3 in. in length, 1£ in. in width, and from £ to £ in’, in thickness. One extremity is smoothly and regularly rounded, and the other is ragged. The sur- faces also are nearly regular, and to the feel they are fleshy. In structure they are foliated like packages of thin membranes, closely compressed; this being well shown on section of one of the specimens. Microscopi- call), Dr. B. S. Shaw found them “composed of epithe- lium, such as is found lining the vagina, namely, large nucleated scales.” The patient was a pallid, fleshy, bloated-looking'woman, about forty-four years of age, and subject to a great variety of distressing complaints. Married a few years, but had never had sexual connexion on account of a contracted state of the vagina. Some time after her marriage she was treated by an empiric for about eighteen months; used602 MOKBID ANATOMY. occasionally strong vaginal injections, and during this time mainly the epithelial bodies were discharged. For the first three months they came away regularly once a month ; but afterward more frequently ; and at last several were passed in a week; the number altogether being ninety-six. The specimens here shown are opaque, and of a reddish color, from the injections that had been used, as the patient thought; the appearance generally being pearly and semi-transparent, according to her report. Menstruation began at the age of nineteen, was generally irregular, and had ceased about two years before the dis- charge of these bodies commenced. Much dysuria for many years, with bearing-down pain, but not much leu- corrhcea. 1857. Mr. T. H. Gibby, med. student. 2794. A cyst removed from the vulva, and about the size of a large filbert. It has been turned inside out, stuffed, and dried ; and, there having been two ducts, these are marked by bristles. Prepared by Dr. B., who regarded it as a dis- tended Cowper’s gland. 1869. Dr. II. J- Bigeloiv. 2795. Two cysts beneath the mucous membrane of the vagina, from £ in. to 1 in. in diameter, and filled apparently with serum. One is just below the os uteri, and the other near the vulva. From the same patient as No. 2791. 1857. Dr. C. Ellis. 2796. A soft and extremely flaccid tumor, that arose from the internal labium by quite a small pedicle, and hung donn 11 in. between the thighs when the patient stood erect. Cuticular covering very delicate, and healthy in appeal - ance. The patient was about twenty jrears of age ; and the o-rowth had been forming about three years. 1856. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2797. A slender, but firm little polypoid excrescence, about an inch in length, and removed from the internal labium of a married woman.

A fibrous tumor removed from the right labium of an unmarried woman, set. thirty-five years. It was of fifteenMORBID ANATOMY. 603 years’ duration, larger than a hen’s egg, hard, movable, painless, increasing slowly, and troubling her chiefly by its size. The patient did well. 1861. Dr. J. M. Warren. 2799. Elephantiasis of the external and internal labia, removed by Dr. J. M. Warren from a girl set. eighteen years. The disease had existed for two years, began in the ext. labia, and formed a rather large tumor; inflamed and painful, with considerable discharge from the surface, though there was no ulceration. Its erectile tendency was shown at the menstrual periods. Clitoris not involved. Hemorrhage not great at the time of removal; and the parts healed well without much contraction. The patient was married afterward, but was soon divorced upon the suit of her hus- band. Dr. W., being then again applied to, found the hymen thickened, and very tough; and, having divided it, the flaps were removed, and the passage was then quite free. She was afterward married again, bore a child in the course of a year, and died in twenty-four hours ; labor not extremely difficult. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2800. Enlargement and thickening of the internal labia, with almost a warty appearance upon the surface. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2801. A small, but highly characteristic specimen of elephan- tiasis of the labia; lobulated, warty, dense, and discol- ored. A tumor, weighing 1£ lbs., and of fifteen years’ duration, had been'removed (No. 672 in the Med. Soc.’s Cabinet), but returned in a year and a half; and when the Moman died, about twelve years afterward, there was a mass upon each side of the vulva as large as a sausage. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2802. An enlarged copy by Mr. B., of a photograph of a Jap- anese woman, who had a tumor of immense size hanging down between her thighs, and that resembled, so far as a poor photograph shows, a case of elephantiasis of the labia. Ihere is no appearance, however, of the vulva ; and, though it may have been an elephantiasis that originated from and chiefly affected the clitoris, it may perhaps have formed about the pubes, and descended as it enlarged.MORBID ANATOMY. 604 The woman was about forty years of age, and the tumor, that had been forming gradually for several years, became at last too heavy for her to carry about, and it was cut off. Weight after removal about 50 lbs. The operation was done in Japan; and the woman was said to be doing well some mouths afterward. The photograph, with these few facts in the case, was sent to Dr. S. Cabot. 1870. Mr. W. P. Bolles, med. student. 2803. Model in wax, by Guy, of Paris, showing a most exuber- ant growth of syphilitic vegetations along each external labium. 1847. Dr. J. C.

The animal was-expected to calve in a few weeks ; and, though the disease was very extensive, and a portion of it was left, when the mass was removed, the animal did well. Dr. B. S. Shaw found the nodules to be “ composed of large epithelial scales, such as are found in epithelial dis- ease of the human lip.” 1867. Dr. G. C. Tower, of S. Weymouth. 2813. A large, unilocular, simple cyst, removed from the breast of a lady sixty-two years of age. It began three years before as a small, painless tumor, and at the end of two years was as large as a goose-egg. From that time it in- creased more rapidly; and particularly the last three weeks, when the summit became discolored. It appeared as a large, globular, fluctuating tumor, and occupied the whole breast; the skin upon the summit thin, tense, shin- ing, and of a greenish color; the nipple pushed to the outer side, and the whole mass perfectly free. It was exceedingly troublesome by its bulk and weight; and the patient did quite well after the removal. The whole mass weighed lbs.; and the cyst contained H pints of a thin, bloody fluid, with shreds of dirty, soft coagula. There were also, apparently, some adherent, film coagula; and some looser, tuft-like masses, from which floated loose shreds of tissue. Otherwise the inner sui face of the cysts was smooth and shining. Dr. G. explained the rapid growth toward the last, and the discoloration by hemorrhage into the cyst. 1863. Dr. T. II. Gage, of Worcester. 2814. A tumor, of an oval form, about the size of a fist, and quite defined, though no proper cyst is generally to be seen. The cut surface, which is very remarkable in appear- ance, might perhaps be described as coarsely and loosely foliated, and as suggesting the idea of a section of the central portion of a cabbage. There seem, also, to be two small tumors, beside the large one. Near the nipple the milk-tubes are seen, somewhat distended. 1847. Dr. J. G. Warren. 2815. Glandular hypertrophy. — From a healthy married lady,606 MORBID ANATOMY. • set. sixty-two years. (Hospital, 71, 125 ; and Med. Jour. Vol. lv. p. 39, with remarks by Dr. Bigelow and others.) Disease of twenty-eight years’ duration, and was at first a small, hard, painless lump. Soon afterward she nursed a child, and from that time it increased gradually until the last year, when the growth was very rapid. The breast ■was at least three times its natural size, and weighed, after its removal, 2^ lbs.; axillary glands not affected. The mass consists of lobes and lobules of various sizes, and very loosely connected ; with a round cretaceous mass in the centre, about 1£ in. in diameter, and not unlike an ossified fibrous tumor of the womb. Microscopically, Dr. Ellis gave the following as the result of his examina- tion : — u Fragment of tumor contained much fibrous tissue, and many lobules, which looked like masses of small nuclei. In the latter no nucleoli could be distinguished. Numer- ous small, round, or oval free nuclei were, however, seen, containing one or two small nucleoli. Tubuli, lined with epithelium, also were noticed. The disease was evidently glandular hypertrophy.” He adds, “ I examined it also with reference to the exist- ence of cysts. On puncturing many parts of the external surface, there exuded a somewhat milky fluid, which had been contained in fissures or flattened cavities of no great extent. The fluid contained numerous cells and free nu- clei of an epithelial character. Projecting into the fissures, from various parts of their walls, were warty vegetations, some of which had a linear or laminated arrangement. One of the largest of these cavities contained a yellowish fluid, somewhat resembling olive oil. In this, in addition to the epithelium, were found many fat globules, and laige spherical corpuscles, apparently formed by the aggiega- tions of the same.” 1856. Dr. II. G. Clark.. 2816. A coarse, irregular, cretaceous mass, about 2£ in. in diameter, and removed from the interior of an encysted breast; dried. From a woman, forty-eight years of age. Eighteen years before her entrance into the hospital (136, 106), the breast became “ caked” after labor, and remained so from607 MORBID ANATOMY. that time, with abscesses twice. During the last three months it had been enlarging rapidly, with severe pain, but without tenderness, and on admission it was about as large as the patient’s head. After the removal, which was attended with much hemorrhage, it was found to be about 6 or 8 in. in diameter, and to consist of a mass of cysts, varying from the size of a pea to that of an orange, and containing a coffee-colored fluid. The patient did well, and left the hospital in about a month. 1869. Dr. It. M. Hodges. 2817. An ovoid tumor, about 3 in. in diameter, quite defined, and with some appearance of a cyst about it. The struc- ture is white, compact, tough, somewhat lobed and lobula- ted, and having a coarsely granulated look upon the cut surface. Glandular hypertrophy, without doubt. 1847. Dr. J. C. War ren. 2818. Another tumor, apparently of the same kind, though not cut through. Size of a hen’s egg; of a rounded and rather irregular form, and with a marked cyst about it in part. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2819. The same. Nearly the size of two fists ; of a rounded and somewhat flattened form. No cyst about it, though very defined. Quite lobed upon the surface, and somewhat so within ; cut surface smooth; but, on handling, it ap- pears reticulated, like fine sponge. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2820. The same. The tumor, which is cut through midway, is of a rounded form, nearly 5 in. in diameter, knobbed upon the sui face, and with a fibro-cellular investment about it. The sti ucture is firm; the cut surface uneven or coarsely gianular, with some appearance of lobes, and generally an inteiveiling dense fibrous tissue. Just below the surface, at one part, is a very marked cyst, into which there pro- jects a tumor larger than an English walnut. Ihe patient, aff. twenty-eight years, had a phthisical look, and died five days after the removal of the mass; tubercular disease being found in various organs. (Hos- pital, 89, 32.) The tumor was of two years’ duration, and increasing ; with considerable pain, movable, and uniformly608 MORBID ANATOMY. hard, except at one part, where it was as hard as scirrhus. 1861. Dr. C.

It was as large as a cocoa-nut, firm, and without fluctuation, but showing an inflamed spot upon its anterior face.

From a gentleman, aet. eighty-six years ; a large, fleshy man, and a high liver. Duration of the disease twelve or fifteen years. About five days before his death an attack came on, similar to those that he had often had, but more severe than usual; bladder distended to above the umbili- cus ; several attempts at catheterism, but blood only came away. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2867. Lateral lobes about equally enlarged, and form a regular, rounded mass, about two-thirds as large as the fist. Canal not cut through, but evidently not enlarged. 1847. Dr. J. C. War ren. 2868. Lateral lobes uniformly enlarged to more than half the . size of the fist, with a transverse ridge, but no third lobe ; the passage being quite free. Bladder dilated, thickened, and remarkably sacculated. Between this last and the rectum was an abscess that contained about two ounces of thick yellow pus, with infiltration of the cellular tissue. From a professional gentleman, set. seventy-five years, who was in the hospital in February, 1854, for about two weeks (64, 8). Within ten years he had had three attacks of retention of urine, and that were relieved by the cathe- tex ; and for the last two years there had been great dysuria. In Ao\., 1853, he had an attack of fever, with great pain at the neck of the bladder, and severe dysuria; and, on admission into the hospital, the fseces could not be retained when the urine was discharged. During his stay there, he was very irritable, but did not suffer greatly from the prostatic disease ; and, as bearing upon the abscess, there was no pain in the perineum, so far as was known. A few days belore leaving the hospital, however, there was inflam- mation of one epidydimis, with discharge of pus from the urethra. After leaving he gradually failed, and died on the 4th of the following month. 1857. Dr. Edward B. Peirson, of Salem. 2869. Lateral lobes enlarged, with some enlargement of the middle lobe, and altogether, about four times the usual614 MORBID ANATOMY. size. Tumors developed in the substance of the gland, as often seen, and suggest strongly the idea of the uterine fibroid tumors. Before it was cut through, the canal readily allowed the passage of the forefinger from the bladder, so that the tip could be felt upon the other side ; though be- tween the bladder and the canal of the urethra there is a high transverse barrier that seemed to completely separate the two. The bladder rose to the umbilicus, and carried the peritoneum with it three-fourths of the distance from the pubes ; organ much thickened and remarkably fasciculated and sacculated; the cysts that rose from the fundus being so thin as to resemble the intestine. The ureters and pelves also were considerably dilated. From a gentleman, set. seventj^-eight years, who had re- tention of urine for the first time five years before death, and used the catheter for two or three months. From that time he strained very much when urinating, his health was much impaired, and he finally died three weeks after a fracture of the neck of the femur. 1855. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2870. A general enlargement of the organ ; and the third lobe, also, stands out prominently, of the size of a large marble, and about as round. From a man who died of pleural disease of about five weeks’ duration. Slight dysuria for about a year and a half. Considerable hematuria for four days after the pleural attack ; and some dysuria, with a tickling sensation, from that time. Passed urine six times in twenty-four hours, but stream never suddenly stopped. Much given to sexual indulgence. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2871. Third lobe enlarged ; and the bladder somewhat thickened . and sacculated. 1847. Dr. J. C. Warren. 2872. The third lobe is about as large as a marble, and stands directly up against the orifice of the urethra; the lateral lobes being not much enlarged. The bladder rose nearly to the umbilicus, and contained §xv. or xx. of clear urine ; muscular coat much thickened and fasciculated ; also three or four herniae of the mucous membrane, near the opening of the ureters, and about as large as the top of the finger.615 MORBID ANATOMY. One of the most striking points is a very defined, smooth, thick band, of a somewhat crescentic form, about an inch behind the prostate and near the extremities of which the ureters open. In front of this band the surface is perfectly smooth, but immediately behind it there is quite a sac, reticulated upon the surface, and in which a calculus might form and lie undetected. Ureters and pelves much dilated. The kidneys were small and dense, and one is shown in the preparation. Several phlebolites about the ves. seminales ; the connection with the veins being very marked. The patient was eighty years of age, and had been fail- ing for about a year and a half, with involuntary urine in the night until six weeks before death. No pain, and no suffering from retention. He had had, however, a “ tumor” in the lower part of the abdomen, that became smaller after urination, but never disappeared, and of which the nature was never suspected. 1852. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. 2873. A very marked and regular enlargement of the middle lobe ; the lateral lobes being somewhat enlarged. Fiom an old man who had been subject to retention of urine. About ten days before Dr. B. saw him, a catheter had been used, and from that time the urine dribbled away. The bladdei was felt as a soft tumor, and of moderate size, above the pubes. Several instruments were tried without success ; and, as the obstruction in the region of the pros- tate was abrupt, and there was no deviation of the catheters to one side or the other, Dr. B. made an attempt to trans- fix by force the projecting lobe of the prostate. The patient, however, was already exhausted, and died within an houi. The preparation shows the puncture made by the instnunent, and that very nearly reached the bladder. 1859- Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 28/4. A moderate, but quite irregular enlargement of the gland ; tluee or four pyriform masses or lobes being formed upon the light side, with the blunt extremities toward the blad- der.

Nineteen days before his death he was exposed to intense cold, and kept his bed from that time, with paroxysms like those of fever and ague, and a great aggravation of the urinary symptoms. Pain in the bladder, but not in the back ; and with pus in the urine. On dissection, there was found suppuration in the cellu- lar tissue about one kidney, and pyelitis in both organs. The bladder, which is shown, was contracted, red upon the inner surface, and contained some pus, besides three small calculi. Phlebolites in abundance, and they are seen in the preparation. 1849. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson. Within a week or two of the above case 1 examined another, in which there was extensive sub-peritoneal inflam- mation, with pus; connected evidently with an enlarged prostate, and immediately excited by exposure to intense cold. 2875.

Jackson. 2876. Abscesses in the prostate gland. From a man, set. forty-six years, who entered the hospital Dec. 9,1867 (134,122). Gonorrhoea thirteen years before, and followed by stricture, but not much troubled by it. Two weeks before admission he found that he could not pass his urine, though it did afterward pass in drops, or in a very small stream ; the scrotum and penis becoming swollen and painful. On admission, the scrotum was enormously swollen, inflamed, and sloughy ; with phymosis, and great oedema of the prepuce. This last was at once divided by Dr. B.; and on passing a catheter, a large calculus (No. 2688) was found in the urethra, and removed by external incision ; an exten- sive incision was then made through the scrotum, the cavity was well washed out, and a catheter was passed into the bladder and retained. Death on the fifth day. On dissection, an abscess was found in each lobe of the prostate, about § in. in diameter, and upon the left side it617 MORBID ANATOMY. opened freely into the urethra. In the cavities were found several prostatic calculi, and others were felt in the sub- stance of the gland. The urethra was sloughy near its origin, and at that part the urine had escaped; but this is not shown in the preparation. 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2877. Prostatic calculi, from the above case. 1868.

I860. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2880. A slough from the urethra of a soldier, who entered a hospital in New Orleans under the care of Dr. H. — On admission, Feb. 20th, he reported a discharge for three ■weeks after impure connection, and for which he had used an injection of two grains of chloride of zinc to an ounce of water. This caused considerable, but not severe pain ; and he had continued it for five days, when the mass sud- denly began to protrude. By gentle traction 7£ in. of the slough were drawn out, and it then broke off. It was of a grayish color, tough though flaccid, tubular in form to some extent, smooth and shining upon the inner surface, with longitudinal folds, and upon the outer surface rough. On the 1st of April he was discharged well, and, so far as was known, without any contraction of the canal. The specimen was examined by Dr. Ellis, who thought “ it was probably a real slough.” It was afterward sent on to Washington to Dr. J. J. Woodward ; and Dr. Curtis having “ made a number of sections,” both he and Dr. W. were “ of the opinion that the specimen is a true slough of the mucous membrane (a part of which is pseudomem- brane). The sections showed blood-vessels with their coats,618 MORBID ANATOMY. and contained blood, connective tissue cells in various stages of multiplication, etc., etc.” 18G5. Dr. John Homans. 2881.

Stricture near the membranous portion of the urethra; . an old cavity in the prostate of the size of a nutmeg; chronic disease of the bladder, and perfect disorganization of the kidney. 2889. Penis and bladder laid open, and showing toward the membranous portion of the urethra a false passage about two inches in length, apparently the result of stricture. Bladder thick and very much dilated. 2890. Urethra laid open, and showing a false passage, but no , appearance of stricture. Bladder very much contracted. 2891. A very close stricture, about two inches from the glans, and two or three lines in extent. The integument beneath the penis has been very extensively destroyed, but was beginning to cicatrize. There are also irregular, shreddy619 MOKBID ANATOMY. cavities, and the same are seen in the parietes of the bladder. 2892. A close stricture, about i in. in extent, and about 3 in. from the glans. A false passage commences just in front of the stricture, and extends to where the penis has been cut off near the bladder. 2893. Sloughing about the membranous portion of the urethra, . but with no appearance of stricture. Bladder thickened, and rectum prolapsed. 2894. The urethra laid open, and shows a defined ulcer at the bulbous portion. It extends through the mucous mem- brane, and is £ in. in extent and 1^ in. transversely. 2895. The prepuce almost entirely detached, and standing off from the organ at a right angle; the glans being com- pletely uncovered and shrunken. Urethra laid open, and shows the lacunae enlarged, but no stricture. — From a gentleman of very dissipated habits, and who died perhaps thirty years ago. 2896. The inside of the prepuce covered b}^ venereal warts. There being a complete phymosis, the prepuce was slit up, and then cut off. A few detached warts in the bottom of the jar were from the glans. — The patient had had gonorrhoea about a year before. 1857. Dr. II. J. Bigeloiv. 2897. Penis amputated for extensive epithelial cancer. The patient, set. fifty years, had had dysuria for sixteen weeks, and an external sore for four. Upon the body of the organ was an elevated, ragged, and partially ulcerated growth, from 2 to 2 J in. in width; the organ being bent upon itself, so that the glans was directed upward. Urine passed frequently, and with scalding; and altogether through an opening in the prepuce for the last two weeks. Patient kept awake by pain, but looked pretty well. (Hos- pital 77, 194.) 1859.

Warren. 2902. Cancer of the glans. The patient was fifty years of age, otherwise healthy, and entered the hospital June 7th (38, 234). In Feb. the . glans was slightly enlarged and indurated; and the orifice of the urethra was somewhat obstructed. As the disease increased, the prepuce became oedematous, with phymosis ; and toward the last of April ulceration began. On admis- sion, the whole glans was hard, irregular, nodulated, super- ficially ulcerated, and about one-third larger than natural; myriads of minute vessels running over the surface, from the dorsum of the penis, and bleeding on the slightest pressure. The prepuce was drawn back with difficulty, and the urine was still discharged in a very fine and twisted stream, and with much effort. — After the removal of the organ, the glans was found to consist of a uniform, pearly, white, dense, coarse structure, with some encroach- ment upon the corpora cavernosa; the fibrous envelope of these last being much thickened, and quite dense so far as the disease extended. Microscopically malignant.—Pa- tient recovered well from the operation, but showed him- self at the hospital the following winter with a return of the disease. 1849. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 2903. Epithelial cancer of the glans. From a man forty-four years of age. (Hospital, 79, 50.) Disease, which was of three years’ duration, began at the base of the glans, and was followed by paraphymosis. On admission, a foul, deep ulcer encircled the penis from the base of the glans toward the pubes, for more than an inch in extent, and with a ragged collar of exuberant granula- tions along the upper edge. Great pain. No marked en- largement of inguinal glands. — After removal, on the 17th of April, the structure appeared of a dull white color, and the epithelial character was well marked, microscopically.621 MORBID ANATOMY. Corpora cavernosa involved. — May 20th, there was an infiltration of urine, followed by erysipelas and sloughing. He recovered, however, well from this attack, and left the hospital on the 2d of August, but with a nodule in the groin about twice the size of a hen’s egg. 1858. Dr. IT. G. Clark. 2904. Disease of the prepuce, regarded by Dr. W. as cancerous. The patient was twenty-five years of age, of robust health, and had had complete phymosis for a long while. About six months before Dr. W. saw him, it became ulcerated upon the inner surface, and gradually swollen, hard, and somewhat painful. After removal, it appeared as a uni- formly white and firm stricture. 1850. Dr. J. C. Warren. V. Breast. 2905. Non-malignant disease. From a physician, aet. thirty-eight years, who first felt in Sept., 1856, and without known cause, an itching, burn- ing, and stinging sensation in the nipple ; with a lancinat- ing pain in the base of the same, and for about two inches around it. Early in the disease he scratched off a scab, but this never formed again, and the nipple was otherwise healthy. In the course of the first month a tumor was felt, and this, with the pain, etc., gradually increased. In Feb. it was removed, and, after the operation, appeared as a de- fined, somewhat oval mass, l£in. by 2J in., and about ^ an in. thick in the centre ; surfaces convex and edges thin. It was closely connected with the nipple, but quite free from the skin, — both of which were healthy. In structure it was fleshy to the feel, and consisted of a whitish, fibro- cellular tissue, with numerous minute, transparent, firm granulations within a line and a half of the external sur- face. Microscopically, Dr. Ellis found fibrous tissue mainly, and no appearance of carcinoma. In 1869 the patient was in robust health, and reported that he had had no further trouble with the breast. He served, however, during the Civil War, and while at the South had swelling with considerable irritation of the other breast, but this, after a time, entirely subsided. 1857. Dr. J. B. S. Jackson.MORBID ANATOMY. 622 2906. Scirrhus. 1847. Dr. C. J. Warren. 2907. The same; a typical specimen, microscopically, and to the naked eye. From a gentleman, set. sixty-nine years. Disease of four or five years’ duration. The tumor had doubled its size during the last year ; and, at the time of removal, was half as large as a horse-chestnut. Dr. B. reports this as the third or fourth case that he has met with. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigeloio. 2908. The same. From a man, set. forty-nine years. (Hospi- tal, 91, 174.) Disease began three years before, with a hard tumor in the breast, of the size of a pea. This in- creased slowly ; and in a year and a half pain began, and became very severe, piercing and shooting toward the axilla. When seen, the tumor was 1£ in. in extent, scirrhous to the feel, with the nipple in the centre, and adherent to the skin. During the removal the pleural cavity was acci- dentally punctured, but no bad consequences followed. SERIES XXXVII. — UTERO-GESTATION. in. Decidua strongly marked. The ovum is in the light tube, measured 2 in. by 1£ in., and the foetus is plainly seen, about as large as at two and a half to three months. The tube is extensively lacerated, but the fimbriated extremity, through which the membranes protrude, is not involved. Both ovaries were very carefully examined, but no corpus luteura was found. The peritoneal cavity was, as usual, filled with blood. . Thn occurred at the State Almshouse at Monson. 1861. Dr. G. H. Gay. I. Parts concerning the Mother. 2909. Tubal pregnancy.

On the morning of the 13th she had a very severe attack of pain, after a dejection, and this continued ; but at 2 P. M., having got relief, she arose, dressed herself, and went down stairs. There she became faint and vomited, and the pain returned with increased severity, and symptoms of collapse. She rested quietly, however, through the night, but the next morning fainted on going to stool, and died at 10 A. M. 1857. Dr. S. D. Brooks, Sup. of the Almshouse at M. 2910. A second specimen. The uterus is seen cut open, with the tube, and the corpus luteum. The woman was twenty-seven years of age, and about ten weeks’ pregnant. Four or five weeks before death a discharge came on, supposed to be catamenial; this ceased after continuing for three weeks, but reappeared a day or two before death. Attacked in the morning with agonizing pain, and she died in six hours, with the symptoms of internal hemorrhage ; the nature of the case having being recognized by Dr. S. On examination, three pints of blood were found in the peritoneal cavity. The ovum was in the outer half of the right tube, 1J in. in length, and no part of it had es- caped from the tube ; the rent in this last being irregular, and J in. in length.

From an unmarried girl, twenty years of age. Pain in abdomen came on at 6 A. M., followed by faintness and great distress, and she died at 5J P. M. The cavity of theMOKBID ANATOMY. 624 abdomen contained three quarts of fluid blood, besides a large coagulum, in which last was an ovum. The uterus is about twice its usual size, and lined by decidua. In its substance a cavity is seen that, in the recent state, was about as large as a small hen’s egg, and into which the right Fall, tube opened, though the cavity did not open into the general cavity of the organ. The rupture of the cavity that contained the ovum into that of the peritoneum was about an inch in length. (See No. 2921.) 1855. Dr. C. H. Stedman. 2913.

A foetus, of which the bones are fully exposed, and only held together by the adipocere into which the soft parts are changed; the whole being very compactly doubled upon itself. From a woman, mt. forty, who had had six healthy chil- dren. She died insane, and nothing was known of an " extra-uterine gestation. The sac (No. 2915) that contained the foetus was in the lower part of the abdomen, upon the left side, with strong external adhesions in part, varying in thickness, but com- pact in structure, cretaceous to a small extent, and with- out any appearance of a placenta. The foetus lay free in the cavit}'; and from its wTeight (4 lbs.), and the size of the bones, had probably reached the full term. A few loose bones, and some faecal'matter were also found in the sac, which communicates with the rectum by two small openings ; and one or two small bones were found in the intestine. The ovaries and Fall, tubes are normal. 1865. Mr. Robert L. Dryer, med. student. 2915. Sac from the above case. 1865. Mr. Dnjer. 2916. The greater part of the bones of a foetus, that was not far from the full term; discharged from the rectum, and displayed by Dr. R. M. Hodges upon a black-board. The patient, about thirty years of age, consulted Dr. S. in Sept., 1861, for a pain that she had had in the lower part625 MORBID ANATOMY. of the abdomen for several months, and that was some- times very severe. There was a slight fulness upon the right side of the abdomen, and, after a vaginal examination, she was thought to be pregnant. Twenty daj^s afterward she had for twelve hours violent pains, like those of labor; and these she had occasionally afterward in a less degree! Early in November she had diarrhoea for ten days, and the discharges were exceedingly offensive ; there being, also, a dark, sanious, vaginal discharge, with vomiting. For sev- eral weeks her situation was exceedingly alarming; and during this period of prostration the bones began to be discharged. The discharge continued until the following July, and the assistance of Dr. S. was often required. From July, 1862, she gradually improved, and in the autumn took charge of a large boarding-house. 1865. Dr. D. II. Storer. 2917. A collection of fcetal bones, which were found “imbed- ded in the fat below the kidneys ” of a sow. Some of them are loose, but they are otherwise intimately fused into a mass about three-fourths as large as the fist. Upon the surface are seen very distinctly a scapula, humerus, several ribs, and an upper jaw with four teeth protruding from it. Dr. M. having sawed the mass before he sent it, there is seen a large cavity, that appears to be that of the cranium, and within it a basilar bone, a portion of a vertebra, and of a pelvis, the crowns of teeth, and a quantity of hair. Be- tween this cavity and the external surface of the mass is an irregular and much smaller cavity, in which are seen portions of long bones; and, upon the surface of what appears to be a cranium, there is hair, and some appearance as of a scalp. Over a large part or the whole of the ex- ternal surface of the mass, also, there seems to have been a thin membrane, with short hairs upon a portion of it. 1869. Dr. 1V. II.

Attended bjr a mid- wife ; and had been in labor ten or twelve hours when Dr. S. saw her. The foetus, which had escaped into the abdom- inal cavity, was turned, and delivered by the feet without much difficulty; there being a cessation of pains, and some collapse. Peritonitis came on in one or two days; and the patient died on the eighth day. — On examination, a thin layer of lymph was found ; but no other effusion, and no blood. The uterus had contracted, so as to close the opening. 1857. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2920. Contraction of the vagina, with obliteration of the uterus. The patient had a difficult labor in the winter of 1845-6, followed by inflammation of the vagina, and, as the patient thought, by a total closure of the canal; there being com- plete amenorrhoea, but without swelling of the abdomen. In Oct., 1850, she died of phthisis. The contraction was an inch within the vulva, and dur- ing life would only have admitted a large goose-quill; but, when the specimen was received by Dr. B., it readily ad- mitted, before being cut open, the handle of a scalpel. Cicatrization commences just behind the orifice of the urethra, and the surface is indurated and somewhat irregu- lar. The whole circumference is affected, but the extent is quite limited ; and the vagina, above, is sufficiently large, and quite healthy. The uterus is small, and the cavity completely obliterated, except perhaps to a small extent in the cervix. 1850. Dr. H. I. Boivditch. t II. Product of Conception. 2921.

A foetus, from a case of extra-uterine gestation. The patient, set. twenty-four years, was first seen by Dr. Willis, of Waltham, on the 4th of Jan., with intense pain in the abdomen ; the uterus being slightly depressed, and very tender. She kept in bed mostly for four or fiveMORBID ANATOMY. 627 weeks, but was at last able to sit up for several hours. On the 12th of March symptoms of internal hemorrhage came on, ancl she died in eleven hours, — in the fourth month of pregnancy. On examination, a large effusion of blood was found in the peritoneal cavhy: and in that of the pelvis an entire ovum, that appeared to lie between the Fall, tube and ovary, but the exact connection of which, with the sur- rounding surface, was not ascertained. The foetus is well- formed, and 6£ in. in length. The uterus was 4 in. in length, changed as usual in pregnancy, and lined by a decidua. 1863. Dr. C. Ellis. 2923. A foetus that was sent from the country to Dr. S., as having been carried twenty-two months beyond the full period of gestation, but which was without any reasonable doubt a case of extra-uterine gestation. The patient, set. forty-two years, had had several chil- dien and miscarriages, and had good reason to suppose that she had reached the full period of pregnancy in April, 1858. Labor pains then came on, but not very actively, and they soon subsided. Menstruation had occurred two or three times before April, and continued to afterward so long as she lived, though irregularly and scantily. A tumoi lemained in the hypogastriuin; but the woman en- joyed good health until Oct., 1859, when she fell down stairs. This was followed by great pain in the abdomen, nausea and vomiting, and four weeks after the accident by copious, loose, and very offensive discharges from the bowels. In Feb., 1860, she died. On dissection, the fundus of the uterus was found very extensively adherent to the small intestine, and also to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. In the cavity that contained the loetus there was no trace of a placenta, but about a pint of thick yellow fluid, with feculent matter, which last was explained by an opening from the cavity into the colon, and through which the left hand and fore-arm of the foetus had passed. —The foetus now weighs (1868) 2 lbs. 13 oz.; and the length of the spine is nearly 7 in.

Dr. D. II. Storer. 2924. Cystic disease of the ovum, from a woman who had been flowing at intervals for several months, and who thought herself pregnant. The mass was about three times as large as the fist. Cysts generally quite large, and connected by portions of the foetal membranes; the cavity of the amnion being quite distinct, with traces of a decidua, though there was no trace of an embryo. 1863. Dr. Wm. Mason, of Charlestown. 2925. A second specimen. — The foetus, which is quite plump and healthy in appearance, weighs 1^ oz., and measures 4£ in. in length. The cord, amniotic cavity, and a con- siderable portion of the chorion, are also quite healthy; but with these are seen numerous C}’-sts, of variable size, and there were discharged with the ovum about two quarts of them. The patient was thirty years of age, had had two chil- dren, and the diseased ovum came away at the end of the third month. There had been more or less, and some- times considerable, flowing during the last six weeks ; and vomiting was an urgent symptom during the whole period of pregnancy. ’ 1863. Dr. G. H. Gay. 2926. A third specimen. — The whole mass was about half a pint in amount; the cysts varying from a pin’s head to half an inch in diameter. Decidua distinct, but no trace of a foetus. For the first three months after menstruation ceased, there was pain in the back, with bearing-down, leucorrhoea, etc. At the end of the second month the uterus was en- larged, but it had subsided at the end of the third. Hem- orrhage occurred at the middle of the fourth month, and increased, with pain, for a week or more, and the “ hyda- tids ” then came away. The woman had had one child, or more, and did not think herself pregnant. Dr. Waldo J. Burnett examined some of the cysts, microscopically, and “ found the parietes to consist of a629 MORBID ANATOMY. simple aggregation of minute granules, such as constitute the primary cell membranes, but neither fibrillae, fibres nor vessels ; the structure being quite different from that of cysts in general. The liquid contents were hyaline ; and, in the larger ones, the granules Avere suspended for precip- itation upon the internal surface; the action of acids showed the presence of albumen.” 1850. Dr. Clias. G. Putnam. 2927. A blighted ovum, about 2 in. in diameter, with a large portion of the decidua vera, but not a trace of an embryo. 1861. Dr. Anson Hooker, of E. Cambridge. 2928. A second specimen. — The foetus is about as large as at the sixth week ; the membranes forming a thick, fleshy, opaque mass, knobbed upon the inner surface, and about 3£ in. in diameter. Menstruation ceased on the 15th of June, and was followed by symptoms of pregnancy. About the 1st of August, the patient lost a child very suddenly; and from that time the morning sickness ceased, the breasts became flaccid, and after one or two hemorrhages, pains came on, and the ovum was expelled on the 21st of Octo- ber. 1849. Dr. M. S. Perry. 2929. A third specimen. — The ovum, which was retained for thirteen months, is of an oval form, about 4 in. in length, and consisted of a whitish, opaque, ilhdefined tissue, with traces of chorion, the remains of effused blood, and numerous little cysts. There were also numerous little cavities, from 1 to 4 lines in diameter, and that had a serous-looking surface within, though they were unlike the other cysts ; and in some of them were small, granular, cre- taceous bodies. From a woman, set. forty-two years, who had had pro- lapsus uteri for three years. In Dec., 1850, menstruation ceased, and in February there were symptoms of pregnan- cy. In May the swelling of the breasts subsided. Some fulness in hypogastrium; but there was no increase after the fourth month, and about the sixth it subsided. During the first six months there were more or less bearing down pains ; in June, September, October, and November, slight, dark, and quite thick discharges from the uterus, which630 MORBID ANATOMY. was enlarged and tender. During the latter half of De- cember two very considerable hemorrhages. About the 1st of Jan. severe and increasing pains came on, and on the 22d the ovum was expelled. 1852. Dr. E. Leigh. of Townsend. 2930. A fourth specimen. — The membranes are about 1^ in. in diameter, and have the usual opaque look, and stiffened feel, without any appearance of villosities. The foetus and cord are, each, § in. in length; and the umbilical vesicle appeared, as usual in abortions at the sixth week, like a yellowish, opaque, compressed, albuminous mass, about a line in diameter. The woman had had a child four j^ears before, followed b}' ulceration of the os uteri, and, meanwhile, four mis- carriages. Toward the end of May she became pregnant. About the middle of July-flowing came on, and continued until after the middle of November, when the ovum was expelled. 1861. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2931. A fifth specimen, rather smaller than the last, but the same in regard to structure, and the umb. vesicle. Inner surface botryoidal, as it so generally is. Frotus rather shorter than the last, and very nearly ovoid in form. Cord | in., and constricted midway. The woman, having had the usual signs, etc., of preg- nancy, had a slight discharge of blood at the end of the third month. At the end of the fifth, the abdomen had ceased to enlarge, and she had various nervous and other symptoms. At the end of the seventh month, and having been quite well for the last few weeks, she made a sudden effort, and the ovum came away. 1861. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2932. A sixth specimen. — A thick, condensed, pyriform, dis- eased ovum, that was sent to Dr. S. as a polypus that had been expelled. The cavity is distinct, but there is no trace of embryo nor cord. 1862. Dr. D. H. Storer. Cases of blighted ova are sufficiently common here, and show that we ought not always to persist in an attempt to prevent miscarriage. The ovum is diseased, and ought to come away, as a worm-eaten apple drops from the tree. In regard to the diagnostic marks of a blighted and re-631 MORBID ANATOMY. tainecl ovum, there are often occasional, slight hemorrha- gies, as in some of the above cases, and pregnancy, that had been supposed to exist, comes to be questioned ; and so the case may go on for months. 2933. A blighted foetus, 7f in. long, and weighing 3£ oz. The surface was tattered, and it had the usual flattened and macerated look; the vessels in the cord being no larger than the smallest sewing thread, and looking as if no blood had passed through them for a long time ; and yet, as usual in such cases, there was no sign of decomposition. The inner surface of the amnion was roughened by a pasty or crumbling deposit. From a case of twins, — the other child weighing 12 lbs. When the mother was four and a half months pregnant, she had a diarrhoea for twenty days, but was well from that time. 1861. Dr. D. H. Storer. 2934. A foetus, 3£ in. in length, and having the flattened, bloodless look above referred to. The different parts are sufficiently distinct, but confused by a very delicate mem- brane, that partly and immediately invests the surface. The whole is quite soft; and, the surface being broken near the umbilicus, there was seen a trace of the deep- yellow discoloration that is so common in blighted foetuses (kirronosis, of Lobstein). One child was born at the full period; and, after the placenta came away, the second foetus was found in the vagina, and enclosed in its mem- branes. These last were collapsed ; and the placenta was thin, compact, granulated, and bloodless. 1852. Dr. E. D. G. Palmer. 2935.

It appeared first above the clavicle, and of the size of a shag- bark ; in six months it was of the size of a hen’s egg ; and when the woman entered the hospital (55, 194), it was larger than the fist, translucent, fluctuating, painless, and extending under the trapezius muscle. Most of the sac was removed; and the portion that extended under the muscle and clavicle was tied; §vj. of fluid being dis- charged, of the color of coffee and milk, with cholesterine and inflammatory products. — The patient was discharged on the tenth day, doing well, though the wound was still discharging. 1858. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. Cyst in posterior nares. (See No. 2068.) 2946. Daguerreotype of a case of hydrocele of the neck. The subject was an infant, six months old. The tumor, which was congenital, was soft and fluctuating, extended fiom the angle of the lower jaw, beneath the clavicle, to the third rib, and disappeared on strong pressure. Nov. 7th, 1863, Dr. B. punctured it, and removed §vj. of serum. A sound was then passed down within the cyst, and to a point just below the axilla; a second puncture was made at this point; a thread was carried through, and the ends tied. On the 17th this last was removed ; the tumor grad- ually disappeared ; and Dec. 15th the child left the hospi- tal well (111, 98). 1868. Dr. II. J. Bigeloio. 2947-8. Daguerreotype of a case of oil C}rst, below the ear. The patient was a man, forty-five years of age, and the tumor that had been forming from the age of three years, was first noticed after the healing of an abscess in the ear; this gradually enlarged until the last two years, and then more rapidly. At the time of the operation it was of the634 MORBID ANATOMY. size of a hen’s egg, immovable and painless; the integu- ments being healthy. Adhesions everywhere intimate, and even to the styloid process. It was, however, dissected out entire, except at one point, where at the summit of the cyst was a hole, large enough to admit a probe, passing through the cartilage of the ear, and appearing beneath the skin, within the concha, and near the meatus; and from this, as a point of departure, Dr. B. thought that the whole cyst had expanded. The inner surface of the cyst was mostly red and shining; but, microscopically, an im- perfect epithelium was seen, and particularly toward and within the perforation. The contents were very remarka- ble ; §ij. of a limpid yellowish oil, perfectly resembling common lamp-oil, and congealing soon after its discharge, at a temperature of 65°; followed by about a dessert- spoonful of what appeared to be a ceruminous and epi- thelial substance, in the form of whitish, opaque, floccu- lent masses. A small seton was passed through the perforation in the cartilage; and the patient did n ell. 185g_ Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2949. A meliceric cyst, removed from beneath the chin of a healthy lad, fifteen years of age. (Hospital, 79, 52.) The tumor began seven j^ears before, on the median line, increased slowly, and only troubled the boy mechanically. Extended to the left angle of the jaw, and looked like a double chin ; fluctuation perfect. The sac contained §iij. or iv. of thick, gray, meliceiic matter, and was lined apparently by skin.

At the operation, it was found to be almost wholly contained in a cavity that it had formed for itself in the substance of the parie- tal bone; the edges of the cavity being sharp, and the depth more than \ in. The aperture allowed but a small portion of the tumor to project above the surface of the surrounding bone ; and this portion alone was felt before the operation. The bottom of the cavity was formed by the internal table of the parietal bone, and was so thin as to spring under pressure. The patient was a young man, oet. twenty-six, and re- ported. the tumor as of three months’ duration; but Dr. H. thought it in all probability congenital, and that the depression in the parietal bone was analogous to the de- pression that is sometimes seen in congenital, circumorbital, encysted tumors.

From a woman, forty-nine years of age, who had had the tumor over the upper part of the scapula for more than thirty years. Occasionally it inflamed, but generally it only troubled her mechanically. The parietes of the cyst were thick; and its interior was lined by a thick, rough, irregular, foliated cuticle, with many raised, crater- like points, as from follicular origin.

The patient, set. nineteen 37ears, entered the hospital (81, 111) with a prominent, fluctuating, deep-seated, pain- less tumor, filling the space between the symphysis, and the angle of the jaw upon the left side, and protruding into the mouth; aud it was as large, she thought, when first noticed eight months before. Integument not affected. Discharged about §ij. of a yellowish, cheesy material. The cyst, inverted and stuffed, shows the epidermal char acter. 1859. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2964. A cast, showing a cyst about the middle of the sole of the foot. The patient was a boy, twelve years old, and his parents thought that the disease was congenital. It was increas- ing in size, but there was no pain nor other trouble from it, unless he wore a tight boot. On admission into the hos- pital, under the care of Dr. H. (125, 140), it was appar- ently about as large as an English walnut, — about one- half projecting above the surface, smooth and clastic, or imperfectly fluctuating. Skin adherent but not discol- ored. No pain on pressure. It was situated between the fascia and the muscles ; and was easily removed ; with a copious discharge of white, cheesy material, consisting of epithelial scales, fat, and cholesterine. Considerable in- flammation followed the operation, but in rather over two weeks the wound had quite healed. — The cast was taken by Mr. C. Pratt, house-pupil. 1866. Dr. B. M. Hodges. 2965. A cyst from the palm of the hand. The patient was a middle-aged woman, and had had a tumor for ten or twelve years near the anterior extremity of the second or third metacarpal bone, but with scarcely any trouble from it until the last two or three months, ■when inflammation appeared upon the corresponding part of the back of the hand. The cyst, which had a fluctuat- ing feel, having been opened by Dr. B., discharged about §ss. of pus and pultaceous matter; and it was then dis- sected out; not connected with the tendon. The parietes are quite thick, firm, laminated, and capable of holdingG3 8 MORBID ANATOMY. from a sixth to one-fourth of a drachm. An abscess seemed to be forming in connection with the cyst, and toward the back of the hand. The patient did well. Cast taken by Mr. R. P. Lincoln, one of the house-pupils. 1867. Dr. E. J. Bigeloiv. 2966. A tumor from the groin, that before removal was nearly or quite as large as a hen’s egg; hard, defined, not dis- colored, and with an opening at the summit; adherent closely to the skin and surrounding parts. It consisted of an opaque, crumbling substance, with an appearance of cholesterine, but had mostly undergone a calcareous degen- eration, and was surrounded by a cyst of condensed cellu- lar tissue. The patient was seventy years of age, and first noticed the swelling in 1827. In 1837 it suppurated, and remained open from that time. In Nov., 1868, the mass was re- moved, and the man did well, though the operation was followed by an enlargement and suppuration of the ingui- nal glands. (Hospital, 139, 97.) In regard to the nature of the disease, Dr. B. could not say whether it was originally glandular or encysted. 1869. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2967. A congenital tumor, and probably an epithelial cyst, that had become cretaceous from the effects of inflamma- tion. Removed from over the tuberosity of the ischium, of a man thirty years old. About two years before the opera- tion, it became tender, opened, discharged a chalky mat- ter, and then healed; but it enlarged from that time. When seen by Dr. B., it formed a projecting tumor, of the size of a filbert, and rested upon a distinct, flattened base, about an inch in diameter. This last, as well as the tu- mor, proved to consist of a number of lobulated, creta- ceous masses; the material being in some parts hard and brittle, like chalk ; and in others pasty. 1859. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2968. A very unusual growth, removed from just below the eyelid. Before the operation the tumor was about the639 MORBID ANATOMY. * size of a walnut, rather soft, though not fluctuating, and not discolored nor adhei’ent. The patient was a healthy boy, sixteen years of age, and the disease was of about a year’s duration, though it had been stationary the last six months. Never tender until the last month, when the skin ulcerated, and a gush of blood followed. After removal, the mass appeared light-colored, dryish, friable, and curiously granular; particles rolling off be- neath the finger, and feeling calcareous. No calcareous mat- ter, however, was found microscopically, but partially de- veloped epithelial cells distributed uniformly throughout the mass. This last was perfectly homogeneous on section, though in certain directions it could be torn in non-con- centric laminae. There was no marked cyst about it, and the surrounding tissues were healthy.

About twenty years before, he scratched off a “mole” from over the rectus muscle, and just above the patella. Four or five years afterward the tumor appeared; and for the last ten years there had been regular, periodic pains in it, but the motions of the part were not interfered with. The tumor was rather smaller than a hen’s egg ; and upon the surface, and near the centre, was a small and faintly brownish mole. The excision was followed by extensive inflammation, sup- puration, and gangrene, but the man finally recovered. 1866. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 2975. Thibert’s model.

It had recently ulcerated upon the surface, and that led her to speak of its existence, which she had kept entirely to herself until the day before the operation. Previously she had been troubled only bjr its weight, which, after removal, was found to be 2| lbs. 1855. Dr. S. D. Townsend. 2979. Eleventh specimen. The tumor weighed about 2 lbs.; and was removed from the scrotum by Dr. Kimball, of Lowell.MORBID ANATOMY. 641 The patient, an Irishman, ret. twenty-three years, had had occasional and sometimes severe pain in the testicles for about five years, with occasional dysuria. About a year after the pain began, the tumor was felt in the lower Part of the scrotum, and the man was pretty sure that it had not descended from above. (See Med. Jour. Vol. lxv. p. 222.) 1861.

Its geneial form is that of a flattened mass, about 22 in. in its two largest diameters, and 6 to 8 in. in thickness. It was composed of many lobes, some of which were quite firm, and others so soft that they fluctuated. Two irregular masses of bone were also found, of which one was larger than an English walnut, and the other about as large°as the top of the finger; situated in a dense fibrous tissue, and containing laminae and true bone corpuscles. Por- tions of the surface were quite vascular ; but the prevail- ing color was white or yellowish-white. In structure, some of the lobes had a fibroid appearance, though a large por- tion of the tumor showed an intermixture of adipose sub- stance. The fat in some parts was of a whitish color, but contained, like the yellow portions, the usual adipose cells. The soft, fluctuating lobes were composed of a delicate, moist, fibrous tissue. In the centre of one of the largest lobes was an irregular cavity, surrounded by brownishtis- sue, and evidently softening. ( The patient, who had been under the care of Dr. Geo. C. Lincoln, of S. Malden, was a sailor, twenty-five years of age, and rather slightly built, though healthy until Nov., 1859, when he first noticed an enlargement of the abdomen. He did not give up his work, however, until he arrived home toward the last of December. For the next two months he kept about, but was considerably troubled iy ins increased bulk. In March he entered the hospital (230, 8), and was there for a short time; the abdomen being enormously swollen, tense, and inelastic, like stiff leather, imperfectly fluctuating, and very slightly tender at 41MORBID ANATOMY. G42 some-points. There was then a considerable amount of ascites, and afterward some oedema of the lower extremi- ties. In April, 1861, the abdomen measured 52 in. in cir- cumference, and was smooth and symmetrical. In May general convulsions came on, and in two days he died. On dissection, the peritoneum contained a little serum, but was quite he'althy. The diaphragm was pushed up to the fourth rib ; the arch of the colon lay above the tumor, and was firmly adherent to it; and the ascending portion, with the whole of the small intestine, lay behind the tumor, and in the right lumbar region. The origin of the tumor, which was extensively adherent, seemed to have been from the sub-serous cellular tissue upon the left side. — The spleen, and a portion of the arch of the colon are shown in the cast, to indicate the different parts of the tumor. 18G1.

An enlarged and admirable drawing, in India ink, of a woman in whom there was formed a tumor that was pei- haps as large as any that has ever been recorded. The estimated weight of the tumor, alone, at the time of her death, was not far from 275 lbs.; and the weight of the patient, without it, was probably not 100 lbs. The sketch . was copied by Mr. Bolles from a daguerreotype, which is also shown. A history of the case, with a wood-cut, was published in the Ohio State Medical Society’s Transactions, in 1851, by the late Dr. Phillip J. Buckner, of Cincinnati, who went two hundred and twenty miles to see the patient, and who took with him a daguerreotypist, in order that he might have a drawing to accompany his report of the case. The patient having died in 1854, the late Prof. John Delamater, of Cleveland, who had seen the patient during life, pub- lished in the Cleveland Medical Gazette, Aug. 1st, 1859, a full history of the case, with a wood-cut similar to Dr. B.’s ; and, in his report, he incorporated portions of Dr. B.’s, with the written statements of Drs. C. II. Beach and D. I. Johns, who were the principal attendants upon the patient, and of Dr. J. W. Smith, who had charge of her643 MORBID ANATOMY. during the last years of her life. The following is a sum- mary of Prof. D.’s report: — The age of the patient, at the time of her death in 1854, was thirty-six years. In 1838, and being then in the sixth month of her first pregnancy, she was kicked in the right iliac region by a cow ; and to this accident she always re- ferred her troubles. She, however, went her full time, and was confined in June ; suffering afterward habitually from soreness of the side, and weakness in the loins. In Sept., 1840, a secoild child was born. Six weeks be- fore labor she lifted a heavy kettle, swooned, and, on recovery, found a small tumor protruding from the vagina. Health delicate for the next eleven months. In 1841 she aborted at the third month, after a fright. Three days afterward she took cold, and had tenderness and fulness of the abdomen; the right side becoming so sensitive that the bedclothes were oppressive. In 1843 a dead child was born at the full period, and after a severe labor. The vaginal tumor at this time pro- jected 3 or 4 in. beyond the labia, was 1£ to 2 in. in diam- eter, and its attachment was beyond the reach of the finger. Subsequently to this labor the whole tumor sloughed off. Difficulty of passing the urine also followed, and the cathe- ter was used for some months. During this attack a soft, immovable tumor was felt, a little to the right of the linea alba, and almost filling the right side of the abdomen; and from that time the abdomen enlarged pretty rapidly for a year. About four years after the tumor appeared in the abdo- men, another showed itself in the right labium, extending to the nates. This last was soft and elastic, and for a yeai or two it could be returned within the pelvis or abdo- 1 men ; but, subsequently, it enlarged pari'passu with the abdominal tumor, and both fluctuated so distinctly that the case was thought to be one of dropsy. The tumors were tapped or incised eight times, but no fluid was dis- chaiged. The abdominal tumor had produced the most distressing dyspnoea, so that she could scarcely breathe except when on her hands and knees. As the tumor of the hip enlarged, however, the dyspnoea was relieved, as well as644 MORBID ANATOMY. the general anasarca, and a numbness of the lower extrem- ities that she had suffered much from. At the urgent solicitation of the patient, the tumor upon the hip was opened, and the finger passed in, but a soft tissue only was felt, and very much like the omentum. After the relief above referred to, the patient’s health improved, she again became pregnant, and in 1848 was delivered at the full period ; artificial means being re- quired, and the child dying during the labor. When this was over she returned to her former condition. Before this last pregnancy, when she was in a sitting posture, which she sometimes attempted, the abdominal tumor rested upon her thighs, and as far as her knees; there being no marked increase of size before delivery, nor diminution afterward. The tumor of the hip was 15 in. long, 10 in. in diameter at its longest part, and 4 in. in diameter at the point of its connection with the perineo- ischiatie region. About 1850 the patient weighed on a platform scale 269 lbs. Her greatest weight, before marriage, and when in full health, was 108 lbs.; and her flesh being very much reduced, her own weight was estimated at the above date at 90 lbs., and that of the tumor at 179 lbs. From this time, or from the year before, she was confined entirely to her bed as long as she lived. In June, 1851, when Dr. Buckner saw her, the circum- ference of the abdomen was 7 ft. 8 in., and the distance from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes, 3 ft. 6 in.; the form of the abdominal tumor being regular and very prom- inent, so that the outline, if continued, would be rather ovoid than round. The tumor of the hip extended along the thigh, and measured 2 ft. 6 in. in length, and 18 in. transversely. The circumference, longitudinally, was 4 ft., and that of the neck of the tumor was 2 ft. 2 in. It was of a regular, elongated form, and considerably larger at the upper extremity than the lower. Some slight mamil- lary elevations, however, existed upon the surface; but these were subsequently found not to differ from the rest of the tumor in structure. During the last year of the patient’s life, there was fre-MORBID ANATOMY. 645 quently a pustular eruption upon the surface of the poste- rior or ischiatic tumor, and leading to superficial ulceration ; but this would in time dry up and heal. With this excep- tion, and those already referred to, her general health was usually good, and her functions were well performed; menstruation being regular as to time and quantity, though painful during the last few years. Toward the close of 1853 the cutaneous affection increased, her health failed, and she died in Jan., 1854. An autopsy could not be had ; but Dr. Smith, in order to get the body into something like a coffin, removed the ischiatic tumor in the presence of the husband. Within it was a cavity into which he passed his arm to above the elbow. The arm was then passed to about the same ex- tent upward into the pelvis and abdomen; and, with the other hand upon the tumor, externally, Dr. S. satisfied himself that the abdominal viscera were intact, and that the tumor was external to the peritoneal cavity. The two cavities contained 8 pints of fluid; the one in the ischiatic tumor being evidently, in the opinion of Dr. S., a process from that of the peritoneum ; and the two tumors, though entirely distinct externally, being portions of one and the same growth. The communication between the peritoneal cavity and the prolongation from it he believed to be through the sacro-sciatic notch; but to this view of the case Prof. Delamater thought that there were objections. The ischiatic tumor consisted mainly of a soft, adipose structure, interspersed with delicate layers of fibrous tis- sue ; and, in bulk, the tumor was large enough to fill a common wash-tub. After the removal of the tumor the genital organs and the anus, which were fully in view, were found to be somewhat drawn to one side, but other- wise unchanged. The abdominal tumor was not examined ; but there can be no doubt, as Prof. D. remarked, that it was mainly adipose. Prof. D. finally remarks that “ the continued growth of these tumors was unabated to the end,” and basing his computation on the above estimated weight of the tumor, he says “ we shall get 268| lbs. as the ultimate of the solid and fluid constituents of these abnormal productions.MORBID ANATOMY. 646 Drs. Johns and Beach estimate the entire weight at 275 lbs., which I have no doubt is within the truth.” 1870. Mr. William P. Bolles, med. student. 2983.

The patient entered the hospital Jan. 3d, 1864 (113, 38). He was forty-two years of age, and the disease was of one year’s duration. The tumor, which had the general aspect of a very large h}^drocele, consisted chiefly of slip- pery lobes that eluded the grasp, and was supposed before the operation to be either fattj' or fibro-cellular. Behind and near the anus the insertion of the scrotum had a brawny feel, and the termination of the tumor was there undefined. On the 30th it was removed. The first lobe that was exposed declared the fibro-cellular character of the tissue; and, after a dissection, which was rendered tedious by the adhesions, the tumor resolved itself into two principal masses. Each of these was somewhat lobu- lated, six or more inches in length, three or four inches in diameter, and smallest at the neck. The dissection was carried downward and backward between the bulb of the urethra and the rectum, each of which was exposed, and through the triangular ligament. Their insertion was dis- covered, fan-shaped and expanded, high up somewhere be- tween the prostate gland and the rectum, where ligatures were passed around the two pedicles and the masses were cut away. These tumors, Dr. B. remarked, are interesting for their insertion high up in the ischio-rectal fossae, which was doubtless their point of origin. The microscope showed647 MORBID ANATOMY. them to consist of a fibroid structure, with some attempt at an elongated cell-growth; and lying free within the skin and not involving it, they differ from a similar structure which is occasionally found attached to and corrugating the skin itself. The tumor reappeared soon after he left the hospital; and when he was readmitted, Jan. 3d, 1867, it was of the size of a large cocoa-nut, and weighed, after its removal by Dr. B., 3£ lbs.; the structure being the same as before. It was dissected from the rectum and about the prostate as high up toward the peritoneum as it was safe to go. The patient recovered well from the operation, and was dis- charged on the 2d of February. 1864. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 2985. A large, fibro-cellular outgrowth of the skin from over • the left buttock.

The surface was discolored as in elephantiasis, wrinkled, perfectly flaccid, and knobbed to the feel as in lipoma. Confinement to the bed for a few dajrs rendered it smaller and softer; the structure after removal being succulent from serous infiltra- tion. A second quite distinct mass was removed from the subcutaneous tissue ; well-defined, somewhat rounded, and about an inch in diameter. Microscopic appearances as in the last case. The wound after the removal of the mass was 13 by 17 in., and the patient became much prostrated, but finally recovered. The disease, however, returned before she left the hospital, near but not in the cicatrix; and, seven or eight years afterward, when Dr. B. saw her, it was about one-third as large as before the operation. !857.

From a negress, about thirty years of age. About three years before Dr. H. excised the tumors, she lent her ear-rings that she wore habitually, to a woman “ who had a humor.” They were worn for two or three hours, returned to the owner in the evening, and at once replaced. In the night she awoke with swelling and intense pain in the ears, and the rings were removed at once. The symptoms, however, continued; and the tumors were soon as large as at the time of their removal. — At the end of five months there was no return of the disease. 1856. Dr. James F. Harlow.

On admission into the hospital (73, 212) it seemed to arise abruptly just below the ham, and was there about the size of a foetal head ; extending downward, and being gradu- ally lost upon the back of the leg. Severe pain in the leg during the last week, and especially about the tumor, which was tender and fluctuating. Foot cool and numb. Dr. Bigelow punctured the fluctuating portion, which discharged a few ounces of bloody serum, and then removed the tu- mor, which was fibrous. The patient did well, though with diminished muscular power in the foot. 1862. Museum Fund. 2997.

As soon as the tumor was removed the patient was instantly seized with intense pain in the region of the kidney of the same side. The pain, howrever, subsided, without any particular pain in the wound itself, and the wound healed well. At the end of twro years there had been no return of the disease. The diagnosis was based upon the severe sympathetic pain that followed the operation. 1862. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. Neuromatous tumors. (No. 1909.) Fibrous tumors in the stomach. (Page 452-4.)

Photograph, before operation, of a case of tumor in the parotid region. The patient was a negress, set. fifty-nine years, and the disease was of twenty years’ duration. No pain at first. The tumor began behind and below the angle of the lower jaw, and extended upward upon the cheek, and down- ward and forward among the muscles of the neck. After removal (Aug. 6th, 1866) it was about as large as the two fists, somewhat lobulated, quite defined, uniformly dense, not vascular in appearance, and presented under the microscope a mixed fibrous and glandular structure. The side of the face was slightly paralyzed after the operation; but the woman is now (Aug., 1868) in good health, and there is no evidence of any return of the disease. 1866. Dr. W. G.

In May, 1858, she was delivered of a large, healthy child, and recovered slowly, but was not well from that time. In Oct. she came under the care of Dr. S., with pain on the left side, cough, some dyspnoea, an inability to lie upon the right side, and with physical signs of effusion into the left side of the chest. Gradually got worse, and died on the 15th of January. On examination by Dr. Ellis, the left side was found greatly distended by the tumor, which weighed, with the652 MORBID ANATOMY. lung, 9 lbs., and measured 13£, 7J, and 4J in. ; the lung being very small, spread out over tho tumor, and entirely deprived of air. Exterhally the mass was deeply lobulated, of a yellowish color, and resembled a fatty tumor. Inter- nally it was moist, of a dull white color, smooth and uni- form in some parts, but decidedly fibrous in many others, the fibres diverging as in the fibrous tumors of the womb. Projecting from the surface, and throughout the whole sub- stance of the mass, were numerous thin cysts, from J in. to 3 in. in diameter, containing a bloody fluid, with some grumous matter in the largest. They were lined by a smooth, bluish or reddish membrane, and some of them com- municated freely. Microscopically, the external portions were composed of elongated corpuscles, quite granular, free, or so closely packed as almost to give a fibrous ap- pearance to the part, but without distinct nucleoli; re- sembling those figured in Paget’s Surg. Pathology, fig. 61. In the deeper seated and more fibrous portions the appear- ance was decidedly fibrous; but, on the addition of acetic acid, numerous elongated nuclei became visible. In the left lung were two similar masses, and in the right lung one, of the size of peas. There was also some effusion in the different serous cavities. (Med. Journ. Vol. Lvm. p. 182.) 1858. Dr. D.

(Page 281-4.) 3007. Cast of the upper part of the body, and showing a very large enchondromatous tumor of the scapula. The patient, a farmer, twenty-six years of age, entered the hospital Dec. 10th, 1863 (111, 186) under the care of Dr. H. J. Bigelow, and remained there long enough for examination. He was a healthy-looking man, and said that the disease began six years before ; that at the end of , four years it was of the size of an orange, and during the last two years had grown much more rapidly. Its antero- posterior, transverse, and vertical diameters were 14 in.; and its circumference at the base 45 in. The form was irregularly rounded; and the hardness almost bony, but with numerous little, hard or elastic projections upon the surface. Skin movable over it, except where inflamed. Skin from the axilla, with the hair upon it, displaced by the growth, and was seen upon the outer and upper part of the tumor. The clavicle was lost beneath the mass ; and upon the arm were two knots that will be again referred to. The case was published by Dr. B. in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lxx. p. 109), with a wood-cut, and in which the patient is represented as standing before' a mir- ror, so that two views of the tumor are shown. In January the man visited the medical schools at New York and Philadelphia. Hemorrhage came on, and he died in eighteen days after he returned home. Dr. B., having been notified of the patient’s death, and that an autopsy could be had, made an arrangement with Dr. Charles M. Carleton, of Norwich, Conn., who had always shown a strong interest in the case, and in whose neigh- borhood the patient lived; and, with his assistance, the tumor was removed, and brought here for examination. The weight of the tumor was 31 lbs.; and in structure it was, to a great extent, as pure an enchondroma as would, perhaps, ever be seen. The lobules were well defined; and the interstices were traversed, as usual, by an abundant fibrous tissue. Where it was firm, or rather dense, the lobules were closely compressed ; but in other parts, and especially at the lower part of the tumor, theyMORBID ANATOMY. 654 were considerably softer, and there they hung more loosely together. To some extent there were no formed lobules, but the mass had an amorphous though somewhat granular appearance ; and here it was still softer, though it nowhere had the gelatiniform consistence that enchondroma some- times has. To a small extent the firmer portion of the tumor had a rich reddish tinge; but there was nowhere any extravasation of blood. At some depth from the sur- face, and where the structure was quite firm, there existed an irregular cavity that would have held §ij. or §iij.; it contained a brownish synovial-like fluid, and the defined parietes were formed by the enehondromatous structure itself. A smaller and similar cavity existed near the above; and in several of the lobules there was a central softening, brownish discoloration and serous infiltration, as if in preparation for a cavity. The amount of cretaceous matter was quite large ; and it was generally scattered irregularly throughout the mass as a creamy-white amor- phous deposit. In very many of the nodules, however, it appeared, on section, as a narrow, defined line, and in the form of a more or less complete ring ; and, on further ex- amination, this ring appeared, in some of them, to be a section of a more or less complete little sphere. After removing typical specimens from different parts of the tumor, the remainder of the mass was macerated to show the cretaceous transformation. The clavicle (No. 3017) was perfectly healthy, though surrounded b}' the morbid growth, except at its outer ex- tremity, where there arose from its upper surface a bony tumor, equal to 14 in. in diameter, or more. This last was of a somewhat reddish color and cancellated structure, and was, in fact, an exostosis, as distinguished from the cretaceous deposit above referred to ; it arose from the outer parietes of the bone, which last, though intimately con- nected with it, was continuous and healthy in appearance, as appeared on section. In this cancellated growth was one small enehondromatous deposit, and its upper extrem- ity was directly continuous with a large mass of the same. The shoulder-joint was entirely disorganized. The headMORBID ANATOMY. 655 of the humerus was in part covered by cartilage ; but one half of it or more was denuded, and to a considerable ex- tent it was pretty deeply carious. The deltoid was quite well marked, and there were the remains of some other neighboring muscles ; but the head of the bone lay loosely in a broad, shallow cavity, lined by a soft, red, cellular tissue, and in which no traces of the original joint were to be seen. The humerus, having been removed, showed the two knots” above referred to (No. 3018). One of them is about as large as the top of the little finger, acumi- nated in form, and shown, on section, to be simply an out- growth of perfectly healthy cancellated structure ; the thin shell of bone that surrounds it, and the parts external to it, being also perfectly healthy. The other is considerably larger, situated rather lower down, and about the middle of the bone, but in other respects similar to the one de- scribed, except that, instead of standing directly out from the bone, it was bent down upon it; and, on section, the cancelli seemed to be filled with an opaque, yellowish- white cerate-looking substance; it contained, however, nothing like an enchondromatous structure. The rest of this bone was healthy ; the reddish color of the cancellated portion contrasting strongly with the interior of the “ knot ” last described. The existence of a pure exostosis, apart and by itself, in a case of enchondroma, is certainly an interesting pathological fact in relation to the nature of this last disease. The right subclavian artery was considerably larger than the left; and, with the nerves, ran along the surface of the tumor, but without being imbedded in it. rLhe separation of the mass, at the time of its removal from the body, was readily effected, and the parietes of the chest were left in a perfectly healthy condition ; a very important fact in reference to an operation, if one had been attempted during life. The internal organs of the thorax and abdomen were also healthy externally; excepting a slight enlargement of the vertebral extremity of one of the middle ribs upon the right side, and which ought to have been, but was not, examined.656 MORBID ANATOMY. The patient’s mother, who is a woman of intelligence, stated that the tumor had been forming ten or twelve years ; but grew slowly until the last three years; then its growth became very rapid, and during the last year it about doubled its size. There had been pain in the “ cords of the neck ” and down the arm occasionally for years ; and sometimes it extended below the elbow. But the patient had no pain in the tumor, and it troubled him only by its weight. His general health had been as good the last ten years as it was the ten preceding. After the hem- orrhage the ulcers upon the surface of the tumor enlarged, and became deeper and sloughed; so that after death a cavity was found not far from 7 or 8 in. in diameter, and 1 or 2 in. in depth, with much of the calcareous matter exposed upon the inner surface. The pain in the arm in- creased, but still there was none in the tumor. He was also unable to move his fingers or the forearm, and there was much numbness, though of this last there had been some before. Meanwhile he was confined to his bed, with loss of flesh, strength, and appetite. ‘(See No. 3019.) 1863. Museum Fund. 3008-10.

The patient is the mother of the subject of the above case (No. 3007) ; seventy years of age, and healthy. The tumor has existed from the age of twelve years, and for the last two has been very painful. Stepping upon a rolling stone strains it, and causes it to swell.—Her son, she says, “had one knee like her own, though not so bad.” Nothing, however, was known of this at the hospital. She also states that her daughter had a similar disease of the wrist; commencing when she was three years old, and increasing steadily until she died, at the age of fifteen years, of fever; the tumor being hard and irregular, and, at the time of her death, larger than her mother’s fist. There was “no length of arm from her elbow down” and for several years she had had no use of her hand. 1867. Dir. C. M. Carleton, of Norwich, Conn. 3020. Cast of an enchondromatous transformation of the whole thumb. The patient was a female, eighty-two years of age, and the disease of three years’ duration. Cause unknown. An elastic, translucent tumor was first seen over the inside of the last joint of the thumb. This enlarged gradually, until a year before the operation, when it involved the whole thumb, and formed a rounded, elastic tumor, about 4 in. in diameter; integuments inflamed, and pain consid- erable. At the time of the operation it had nearly doubledMORBID ANATOMY. (558 its size, and was still somewhat elastic; being 8 in. by nearly 5 in. in diameter, and in circumference 13 in. Its weight, after removal, was about 21 oz. The integuments were thickened from inflammation ; with a foul ulcer nearly 2 in. in diameter, in the situation of the nail; and a slough, midway, 1£ in. in diameter, and an inch deep ; the pain being urgent enough to keep the patient awake. Having been removed with the metacarpal bone, a single longitudinal section was made through the mass, and ex- posed an almost uniform, translucent, bluish-white tissue, minutely and irregularly divided into lobules, averaging in size a split pea, and each invested by a distinct fibrous tissue. The mass varied, as to density, in different parts ; being greatest toward the centre, where there were some cartilaginous-looking lobules, with considerable traces of the caneellar structure of the first phalanx. Toward the extremity, the structure was gelatiniform and more vascu- lar, though still lobulated ; the same soft lobules being interspersed throughout the whole tumor. The skin and a thin layer of cellular membrane invested the mass, and could be readily separated from it; all trace of the origi- nal structures within having disappeared, excepting an extensor tendon, and the remains of bone above referred to. At the time of the operation, one quite defined lobe was found to extend into the ball of the thumb. Metacar- pal bone healthy, though imbedded for one-half its length in the overlying tumor; anteriorly covered by healthy cartilage ; and, the sjmovial membrane being reflected over the corresponding surface of the tumor, a proper articular cavity still remained. Upon the back of the thumb one of the extensor tendons was to some extent deeply imbed- ded in the tumor, but was afterward inserted b3' a broad and very thin expansion in a mass that appeared to repre- sent the last phalanx. Microscopically, the soft parts showed cells from one to two thousandths of an inch in diameter, and containing one or more nuclei, with considerable granular matter. In these parts a structureless or fibrous tissue was found, in which naked nuclei were imbedded, and interspersed with the above cells. The cartilaginous-looking portions showedMORBID ANATOMY. 659 x a. tendency to the formation of irregular, cartilaginous corpuscles; but there were none seen that were well marked. The patient recovered well from the operation ; and some years afterward there had been no return of the disease. (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., July, 1853, p. 84.) 1858. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3021.

The tumor ap- peared over the gland nineteen years before, was painless, and grew slowly, but had doubled in size the last year. On admission, it was as lai’ge as a child’s head ; extending from the malar bone to 4J in. below the mastoid process,662 MORBID ANATOMY. and from this process forward to the larynx. It was knobbed, and mostty hard, but some parts were soft and fluctuating. Skin tense but unbroken. Larynx pushed to one side, but moved independently of the mass. On the 21st the entire tumor was removed ; and, though the mucous membrane of the mouth was pushed before it, and the pharynx and oesophagus wrere to a large extent in close contact with it, no opening was made into these cav- ities. There was much venous hemorrhage, and conse- quent depression ; but no large vessel was cut. The ramus of the lower jaw was bent inward by the growth of the mass, and it was necessary to divide it at the angle. It was also necessary, for the command of the tongue, to use the forceps and a double ligature. On examination of the tumor, Dr. B. found it sufficiently hard and smooth, as if invested by a fibrous capsule ; with very marked lobes and fissures, and in the deepest of which had lain the ramus of the jaw. On section, it appeared to be a well-marked specimen of the mixed cartilaginous tu- mor of Paget; surface flat, with small, honeycomb cham- bers, and anfractuous and discolored cavities, traversed by bands, and filled with bloody serum. Portions of the mass were dense, opaque, white, and finely mixed with a bluish, enchondromatous tissue. Other portions were more uni- formly cream-colored, and softer, without the enchondioma. The enchondromatous portions showed unequivocal carti- lage cavities, somewhat imperfect in their structure, and marked with tough and branching fibre. T.he cream- colored tissue wras more distinctly cellular and granular. The cells were extremely irregular; mostly caudate and fusiform, or with processes; but they showed none of the rounded cells of some cancerous growths, to which last the tumor bore no resemblance. In regard to the nature of the tumor, Dr. B. thought that until the last few years it might have been regarded as benign ; but that its late rapid growth would suggest the idea of its return. On the 13th of Feb. the wound was healing fast, and the man left the hospital; the hearing in his right ear, which had been lost for many years, having been restored.MOKBID ANATOMY. 663 In September, 1863, the disease returned ; and in Febru- ary, 1864, when he re-entered the hospital, there was one tumor, of the size of an egg, and another smaller one. On the 27th these were removed, and were found to extend to the mucous membrane of the fauces. Sloughing and hemorrhage followed, and on the 7th of March he died. On dissection, the organs were found healthy. The tumor was found by Dr. Ellis to consist, microscopically, of closely aggregated cells; irregular, as if shrivelled, and without distinct nuclei or other marked characteristics. 1864. Dr. H. J.

It was situated in front of the ankle-joint, and appeared like an enlarged bursa, though painful; firm, rounded, elastic, and about 2 in. in diameter. — The patient was a woman, fifty-five years of age, and had had the disease for several years. (Hospital, 78, 197.) The tumor was of a dark-reddish color, slightly vascular, rather soft, and. bound down by fibrous bands. On section, it seemed to consist of three or four lobules ; structure compact; surface smooth; generally of a dull, light brownish-red color, but with numerous small spots of a bright orange-red. Upon the external surface this last color was more extensive. Microscopical examination by Dr. Ellis. 1859. Dr. S. D. Townsend. Myeloid disease of tibia. (See No. 1485.) 3034. Cast of the side of the face, and showing a tumor in front of the ear.664 MORBID ANATOMY. The patient, a female, set. thirty years, entered the hos- pital June 26th, 1852 (53,100). Disease of fourteen years’ duration. Removed in three years, as a fibrous tumor, and it was then of the size of a pigeon’s egg. Three years afterward it returned. Removed again in April, 1851 ; size of a hen’s egg. In October two tumors appeared, but afterward united. On admission, it had a regularly rounded form, measured 44 by 3 in., and dipped down behind the ramus of the jaw. Had grown more than one-half since April. Surface smooth, but lobulated and dense, though not elastic to the feel; quite movable; neither painful nor tender, but with an occasional tingling, and for a long time after the last operation, numbness, though no loss of muscular power. Tumor removed by Dr. H. G. Clark, June 30th, and found to be fibro-plastic. Operation followed by some paralysis of face. In the autumn the disease again re- turned, and in May, 1853, Dr. C. removed a mass about the size of a filbert; composed, according to Dr. Bacon, “ partly of fibrous tissue, and partly of fibro-plastic ele- ments in various stages of growth. No cancer cells found.” Cast taken in June, 1852, by Mr. Albert F. Sawyer, one of the house-pupils. 1852. Dr. H. G. Clark. 3035. Photograph of a man, thirty-nine years of age, whose orbit was filled by a hard tumor; the eyelids being adhe- rent, and protruding nearly an inch. Twenty-three years before, a tumor formed in the orbit, and in about two and one-half years it was removed with the eye. In seven years the disease returned, but for eight or ten years had been stationary. Removed by Dr. Bige- low ; but a portion of the tumor was left, as it grew from the posterior part of the orbit, and it was thought unsafe to <ro any further. Some serious symptoms followed ; but the man finally did well, and left the hospital (138, 222) in about four months. 1869. Mr. B. S. Kent, Jr., one of the house-pupils. 3036. A tumor between the flexor tendon of the middle finger and the bone.MORBID ANATOMY. 665 The patient was a boy, nine years of age, and had had the disease for seven years. The tumor centred about the second joint, and was quite prominent; form oval, with flattened sides. The whole joint was enlarged; and for about two years there had been inflammation, with a fluid ’ discharge, but without pain. One surgeon had diagnosti- cated tubercular disease of the bone. Amputated at the first joint; and, in the preparation, a long, incision has been made through the bone and tumor. This last looked like a fibro-cellular tissue, with some mixture of fat; but, microscopically, was found to be “ fibro-plastic.” 1856. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3037. Three colored lithographic views of a specimen of epulis, removed from the lower jaw; as seen from above, from the outside, and on section.

From a man, mt. fifty-eight years, who, in 1840-1, froze the right side of his face severely. Uneasiness and dry- ness in the right eye followed, and continued until April, when he had iritis. In six weeks this was relieved, but with slight eversion of the eyeball. In 1847 a small tumor appeared below the eye, but varying in size at dif- ferent times. In 1850 he was treated for an inflammation of the eye, but without any effect upon the tumor; and the same in 1854. In 1860 the tumor protruded the ball, and everted the lower lid; and, being punctured, gave issue only to blood. For the next three years it steadily increased. Juty 9th, 1864, he entered the hospital (114, 24), and the exophthalmia was then hideous ; the tumor being apparently somewhat larger than a hen’s egg, and protruding the eye forward, with slight eversion. Upper lid very much distended. Conjunctiva thickened, ulcer- ated, and suppurating over the everted lid. Traces of the iritis remained, and the sight was impaired in consequence. The tumor was elastic, somewhat movable, rounded, and without lobules; not pulsating, and feeling, as the man said, perfectly “ dead.” General health robust.666 MORBID ANATOMY. July 10th the tumor was enucleated without difficulty, and without hemorrhage; the eyeball falliug back, and requiring a stitch to keep it in proper relation to the lids. It was as large as an egg, smooth and ovoidal in shape, and on section consisted of a cavernous structure, filled with blood, easily evacuated by pressure and washing, by which processes it was reduced in size one-half, and was then seen to consist exclusively of cells, analogous to those of the corpus cavernosum penis, and capable of inflation with a blow-pipe, so as to reseinble the section of an em- physematous lung. Under the microscope there were no signs of any vessels, or of any other structure than a cav- ernous one. The tumor was enclosed in a tough capsule, into which no vessel could be seen entering. Aug. 8th the overstretched lids had contracted, and the motion of the eye was almost equal to that of the other. Sight better than for seven or eight years past. On the 12th he left the hospital; and a month later the lids had shrunk to their natural proportions, and there was no longer any appreciable deformity. Dr. H. remarked upon the perfectly encysted character of the tumor, and the absence of any vascular connection, of appreciable size, with the surrounding parts, though its active vascular character still remained. Yon Carrion, he said, had described this disease (Lelirbuch der prahtisclien Augenheilkunde, Vienna, 1861, p. 506) ; and Dr. H. re- ferred to a tumor, in man}*' respects similar to his own, that was removed by Mr. Liston from the popliteal space.

Microscopically, Dr. B. found it epithelial; and, as a whole, something that he had not before seen. 1860. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3040. Photograph of a case of large cancerous tumor in the neck.I MORBID ANATOMY. 6G7 The patient was a man, thirty-one years of age, and the disease had been forming between two and three years ; not directly painful, but much pain in the back and side. The tumor extended from the clavicle to the angle of the jaw, anteriorly to the median line, and posteriorly to with- in 2£ in. of the spine. It had a very lobulated feel; elas- tic in part, but over the lower half hard, knobbed and slightly reddened. Upon the other side of the neck was another small tumor. The diseased mass was removed by Dr. C.; a small portion of it being left behind. The carotid art., which passed through it, was tied and divided. On the eighth dajr the patient fell off, and in three days more he died. (Hospital, 111, 32.) 1865. Dr. H. G. Clark. 3041. Cast of the knee, showing externally an encephaloid tu- mor in the popliteal region, and of the size of a large orange. The patient was fifty-five years of age, and the disease of four or five years’ duration. The tumor, when first noticed, was of the size of an acorn; and there had been no increase nor trouble from it until the last four months, from which time it had grown rapidly. It was hard and fixed, and the skin of a reddish color, at the prominent part; with dull pain, and slight aflection of the motion of joint. Amputation by Dr. W. On the ninth day the man began to sink, and in about four weeks more he died with pyemia and pneumonia. (Hospital, 120, 218.) Cast by Messrs. J. Collins Warren, and A. S. Nichols, house- pupils. 1866. Dr. J. M. Warren. 3042. Cast, of the trunk and head of a little girl, taken after death, and showing an immense encephaloid tumor. It arises from the right shoulder, and side of the neck, as high as the ear, extending nearly to the spinal column, down upon the scapula, as low as *the axilla, and in front to about the second rib. Its vertical diameter is about 13 in., and the transverse 9-J in.; the summit rising to about the level of the head, which is pushed to one side by the great mass. Sent to the Museum by Dr. H., at the request of Dr. J. M. Warren, and with the following account of the case.MORBID ANATOMY. 6G8 The patient was fourteen years old, and entered the New York Hospital Nov. 17th, 1847. The tumor had been first noticed four months before, over the clavicle, and was then of the size of a pigeon’s egg. Growth very rapid for some time past, but without pain, until it was of considerable size. Itwrent on increasing, with d}rspnoea and dysphagia, and such severe and lancinating pain as to require a free use of opiates. The surface at last opened and discharged a reddish fluid ; and the child died, greatly emaciated, on the 29th of June; the whole duration of the disease being only about eleven months. On dissection, Dr. H. found the humerus detached from the scapula; and the clavicle, with the three upper ribs softened, but not infiltrated with the disease. Weight of the tumor, with the arm, 33 lbs. The right lung showed traces of the disease ; and in the upper lobe were miliary tubercles. Otherwise the organs were healthy. Upon the front of the right arm was a very curious con- genital affection, — as shown in the cast, — a flabby and pendulous condition of the skin and integument, extending from the elbow nearty to the acromion process, involving nearly one-half of the circumference of the arm, and growing with the child’s growth, but causing no inconven- ience. This may have been a form of disease described by Dr. Mott, as pachydermatocele. (Med. Chir. Trans. Vol. xxxvii. p. 155 — with two figures.) 1848. Dr. Alexander E. Hossack, of New York. 3043-4.

The patient was a man, forty-seven years of age, who had had a tumor there for twenty-four years; and, two years before his entrance into the hospital (77, 189.), a mass, weighing 2 lbs., had been removed. The disease having returned, Dr. B. amputated the arm at the shoulder- joint. The ulnar nerve entered the upper part of a laro-e cancerous tumor, and just before it was lost in it bulged out to the size of a sparrow’s egg. This last was felt very distinctly before the operation; and also a firm cord, running down into the tumor from the axilla, and which was very painful on pressure. The man recovered well from the operation, but died four months afterward. (See Nos. 1530 and 2037.) 1858. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 3048 Thibert’s model.

Daguerreotypes of a case of disease of the antrum. The patient was a farmer, aet. sixty-three years, who had had pain in the jaw for six months. (Hospital, 61, ISO.) Three or four teeth were extracted without relief and swelling followed. The antrum was opened from below, and about §ss. of a material like boiled sago was removed ; the grains, however, being smaller, and hanging m bunches; microscopically glandular. The cavity°was syringed with water; and on the third day the man left the hospital. The swelling, however, still further in- creased, and he died nearly a year after the operation — The daguerreotypes were taken some months after he left the hospital. The disease.

From a man, forty-one years of age, who sometimes ate pork three times in the week, and occasionally ate it raw. Health good till 1854, when he had vertigo, sinking at the stomach, and a strong craving for food. Symptoms con- tinued, and in Aug., 1856, he passed about six feet of the worm. After strict abstinence for a week, he took a ca- thartic, and passed 17 ft. 9 in. more. In December there was a recurrence of the symptoms ; and after kousso, fol- lowed by a cathartic, he passed 20 ft. more ; one extremity being very slender, but without the head. Theie vas thirst, irregular appetite, pain in the stomach, and geneial debility. In Jan., 1857, he passed two small pieces at different times. In March the symptoms were quite press- ing ; and, after a dose of kousso, he passed 21 ft. of the worm, with the head here shown. Altogether the frag- ments amounted to 71 ft. 3 in. In the course of three months his health was restored, and in 185S it continued good. 1858. Mr. T. H. Pinkerton, med. student. 3061. A second specimen, and regarded by Dr. J. C. White, as T. mediocanellata ; head very distinct. The patient was a healthy little girl, nine years old, who passed about 9 ft. of the worm, March 3d, 1863, after the tinct. of rhubarb ; having had an inordinately strong appe- tite for the previous six months, and especially for meat. On the 23d' of the same month, after a full dose ol pump- kin seeds, followed by active cathartics, she again passed 9 ft., and afterward another portion, with the head. 1867. Dr. Stephen Salisbury, of Brookline. 3062. A third specimen. — The patient was nineteen years of a^e, and had passed a taenia a year before. When Dr. L. saw him, he had had for two -weeks general malaise, con- stant headache, aberration of mind, anorexia, constipation, and Qli(rht fever. Under the use of active cathartics, and a blister to the back of the neck, he was much relieved, and thought himself nearly well; but at the end ol two weeks joints of the worm were passed. Half an ounce of kousso was then given, after he had fasted for twelveMORBID ANATOMY. C73 hours; in three hours he had a second dose, and 8 ft. of the worm were afterward passed, with the head ; but this last was unfortunately lost. Dr. L. remarked that Dr. Weinland had recorded cere- bral or cerebro-spinal symptoms in sixty-eight out of one hundred cases of taenia; but he questioned whether the headache, etc., were due to the worm, in consideration of the great relief before this last was expelled. (Med. Jour Vol. lxxv. p. 426.) 1867. Dr. G. H. Lyman. 3063. A fourth specimen ; remarkable for the shortness of the joints. From a gentleman, who had often passed frag- ments of'the worm, and whose health was much affected. Discharged after the use of powerful cathartics for several days; turpentine having been previously tried without effect* 1848‘ Dr. G. Hayward. 3064. A fifth specimen ; about 22 ft. in length. —From a me- chanic, who had been out of health for a long time, but had never passed any fragments of the worm, so far as he was aware. Dr. G., who is a medical electrician, gave him a charge (100 cups — Daniel’s battery), and the worm was expelled before the man left the house. His health was restored ; and no more wras passed. 1863. Dr. A. C. Garratt. 3065. A sixth specimen ; the head, with a small portion only of the worm being shown. Examined by Dr. J. Wyman, and found to be a T. mediocanellata. From a painter, rnt. twenty years, who had served for three years in the War of the Rebellion, and often, from choice, ate his beef half cooked. For the last few months he had lost his appetite, was costive, felt generally sick, with diminished flesh and strength ; no pain. Small pieces of the worm had passed the last month. Dr. P. gave a dose of salts, then milk diet for twenty-four hours, and then 1 oz. of kousso in gxiv. of water. This last was taken in three doses, and at intervals of fifteen minutes; and in ei<dit hours the worm (about 12 ft. in length) came away.°— Di. P. insisted strongly upon the preparatory treatment. ^8^8’ Dr. Luther Darks, Jr. 3066. A seventh specimen. — From a man, thirty-eight years 43 JMORBID ANATOMY. 674 of age, and of intemperate habits. In April he had pneu- monia, and passed about 4£ ft. of the worm. Joints passed occasionally during the summer; and, about the last of November, on account of an oppression at the epigastri- um, he took medicine, and passed a considerable piece. A few days afterward Dr. I. was called, and found him with ascites. Castor-oil and turpentine were given, and 7 ft. of the worm were expelled. General dropsy supervened, and he died very shortly afterward. — On dissection, a granulated liver was found ; and, about the middle of the small intestine, 3 in. of the taenia, lying free, though buried in mucus. Dr. Gould examined this last, and found the club-shaped head, the four oval orifices, and in the centre a minute pit, but no marked orifice, and certainly no trace of a coronet of booklets. His drawing, which is shown with the specimen, proves it to be a T. mediocanellata. 1852. Dr. II. B. Inches. 3067.

Appetite voracious ; pain at epigastrium; and some loss of flesh. After kousso, fol- lowed by turpentine, portions of the worm were passed, that amounted altogether to 22£ ft. 1856. Dr. Z. B. Adams. 3070. A second specimen. — From a young gentleman, ast. sev- enteen, who had been in Europe for three years, and foi the last few months in Switzerland. Some months after his return he passed a few joints of the worm ; and, after a cathartic, about 10 ft. In the course of the following year other portions were discharged; and, after a dose of the male fern, and an active cathartic, 8J- ft. more wereMORBID ANATOMY. 675 discharged. Both specimens are preserved, and a head is said to have come awajr with each, though it cannot now be shown. Several years have now elapsed, and there has been no further trouble. 1867. . Dr. II. J.

Dr. J. Wyman. 3072. A second specimen. — From a rather young adult, male, dissecting-room subject, and in whom no organic disease was found. Great numbers of the parasites were found throughout the muscles of the limbs and trunk, some in the integument, and many were seen as well as felt just beneath the skin.

The patient was a lady, thirty-five years of age, who had had foi se\eial jears pain and uneasiness in the right hypochon- drium. In the spring of 1856 an obscure tumor was discov- ered there ; “ feeling like a watch,” and deeply seated be- neath the integuments. In April, 1857, a large tumor was rap- idly developed in the same spot; excessively painful and tender, and compressing the lung so that the resp. murmur could only be heard at the upper part. One night she had several discharges from the bowels, of a clear, colorless, and exceedingly fetid fluid. The tumor disappeared almost wholly, and at once; and there was extreme prostration, with much fever, from which she slowly recovered. About the 1st of June she began to cough, and expectorate frothy mucus ; and about the first of September she began to cough up the hydatids ; two or three being discharged676 v MORBID ANATOMY. at a time, and about twice a week, with a sensation as if the}7 came from the lower part of the right lung. In Oct., 1857, the tumor could no longer be felt. The health steadily improved ; and in Sept., 1859, when the case was reported, she was quite well, and had not coughed up any of the hydatids for three months. 1859. Dr. F. Minot. 3075. Echinococci from the thigh. The patient was a woman, thirty-five years of age ; and upon the front and middle of the thigh was an oval, and very defined tumor, 7 or 8 in. in length, painful, solid to the feel, and prominent above the surface, which was smooth, tense, and shining. Removed by Dr. Jordan, of S. Reading, who found that it dipped down between the bellies of the rectus muscle, and was firmly adherent, so that a portion was left behind ; the surrounding tissues be- ing healthy. There was a large, white, enveloping cyst, containing one to one and a half pints of serum ; and, by estimate, about sixty of the hydatid cysts, which were free in the cavity, varied from about -J- in. to 1 in. in diam- eter, and presented the usual appearance of cysts contain- ing echinococci. Microscopically, the characteristic, stri- ated appearance of the cysts was found; and upon the inner surface the parasites themselves. — The specimen, which consists of two of the hydatid cysts, and a portion of the envelope, were sent by Mr. J.

A second and similar cast; from a case of leucocythe- mia. — The patient was a widow, forty-two years of age, and the enlargement had been known to exist for about two years. The tumor could be seen as well as felt be- tween the cartilages of the ribs and the umbilicus. Through the vagina, also, it could be felt, soft, and as if containing fluid. The woman was very pale, with loss of flesh and strength, a rapid pulse, variable appetite, constipation, dyspnoea, and during the last }7ear, amenorrhoea. There was epistaxis for the last six months, increasing in fre- quency, and often severe; and diarrhoea during the last week. The nature of the case was misunderstood ; and the patient was to have been operated upon, as for ovarian drops}7, if she had not sunk under the constitutional effects of her disease.—The organ weighed 4 lbs. 14 oz., and measured 12£ in. by 5J in.

This case occurred about the time that leucocythemia was being made known to the profes- sion. 1847. Dr. E. Leigh. 3096. Portion of the spleen, showing the yellowish masses that are occasionally met with in connection with organic disease of the heart. The patient had frequently had intermittent fever, and died from disease of the heart (No. 1707). The organ weighed 1^ lbs., was generally firm, and some lighter colored portions were particularly so. The opaque, yellowish masses were moderately firm, and sharply defined; one being an inch in diameter, and the other, 2 in. by 1 in. They came quite to the surface, as usual, so as to be at once seen ; and there were some remains of false membrane upon the peritoneal surface, as is so often the case. Microscopically, the masses con- sisted of small granules, about the size of blood-globules. In the preparation the color has much faded.

A mass of glandular substance, that contained three cysts that were filled with blood, and that was removed from the thyroid gland. The patient was an unmarried woman, aet. twenty-five years ; and the disease was of twelve years’ duration. It began upon the median line, increased slowly until the last year, and then rapidly. On admission into the hospi- tal (114, 248), it occupied the whole front of the throat, and extended from side to side, 12 in. ; uniform in aspect and in its elastic feel, aud but little movable. It was supported by a net, on account of its weight, but caused no other discomfort. The patient was rather anaemic, and lepoited that her grandmother had cancer. — The mass was easily removed, but the hemorrhage was profuse, and the blood seemed to ooze from the whole surface. The patient soon rallied from the operation, though the swelling caused gieat dysphagia for a time; and in about a month she was discharged well. Di. H. lemarked that in two other cases the tumor was peeled from a bed of healthy thyroid gland, and the hem- onhage from the whole surface was such as to require liga- tures to be applied en masse.

From an unhealthy woman, set. thirty-seven years, whose skin had been discolored for eight months before her death. Under the care of Dr. Fogg, of Dedham, for the last four or five weeks, who found the face and hands of a dark-682 MORBID ANATOMY. brown color. Debilit}' was the chief complaint, but she kept about until the last two clays, when she had nausea ; appetite craving; costive. Both capsules were very much thickened, and one was several times larger than natural. The right was mostly converted into a firm yellow material, with considerable calcareous matter. The left consisted throughout of a yel- lowish, firm, caseous, or calcareous material, with a consid- erable amount of thick, puriform fluid. 1867. Dr. C. Ellis. 3103. A second case; the first that was observed here, and very fully reported by Dr. G. in the Med. Jour. vol. lvi. p. 480. The patient was a farmer, set. forty-four years. Health robust, but had been failing the last year. Loss of flesh, strength, and appetite; frequent nausea and vomiting; pain in abdomen on stooping; irregularity of bowels; coldness, rigidity, and insensibilit}'- often in the fingers ; dizziness, failure of memory, and listlessness. Gave up work about two months before death. Complexion, during the last eight months bluish, or almost purple, so that dis- ease of the heart was thought of. May 22d, 1857, he ar- rived here from the eastward, and on his way to the West for his health. He had been very sea-sick ; and was found in the morning in his berth insensible, -with irregular breathing, a very rapid and feeble pulse, hiccough, inability^- to swallow, firm closure of the eyelids and contraction of the pupils; hands very cold, and fingers rigidly flexed. In this condition he was carried to the hospital (211, 50), where he died in six hours. The skin looked as if there might be a mixture of Indian and Negro blood, which, however, was not the case ; and the discoloration was not confined to the exposed parts. The cheeks were decidedly bronzed. For some weeks a discoloration had been ob- served within the mouth; and it was seen, bordering the lips, as a circle of dark, but not livid spots. Dr. Ellis found the renal capsules adherent to the sur- rounding fat. The left was much thicker than usual, very firm, and of a bluish-white color, though much of it was occupied by soft, yellow deposits, resembling tubercular683 MORBID ANATOMY. matter or concrete pus. The deposit consisted of minute globules or granular corpuscles, varying in size from those of tubercle to those of pus. The firm portion was fibrous. The right capsule was smaller than usual, though thicker at one part, and nowhere flat as usual; disease as in the left, but much less extensive. There was, also, some old disease of the brain, ecchymoses in the lungs, and a large quantity of blood in the heart, that was fluid, and contin- ued so after removal from the body. 1857. Dr. A. A. Gould. 3104. A third case. —The patient, a female, set. thirty-one years, had been under the care of Dr. B., for about a year, with debility, a bronzed skin, and other anomalous symp- toms ; the discoloration terminating near the margin of the hail, and leaving a narrow white line between the two. Occasionally there were attacks of indigestion ; and during her recovery from one of these, she indulged very grossly in indigestible food, and died in consequence. Both re- nal capsules were greatly enlarged; texture firm; and studded thickly with irregular, tubercular-looking deposits, from the size of a small shot to that of a chestnut.

Dr. Bigelow mentions (April 1st, 1870) some important facts in regard to this case, and that were not referred to in the papers from which the history (p. 149) was drawn up. He says : “ When addressed, his expression was in- telligent and singularly pleasant. He evidently appre- hended what was said to him, but rarely replied in words. His habitual reply on such occasions was ‘ mais, oui; ’ and this, with the word ‘ tabac,’ of which article he was very fond, seemed to constitute his vocabulary. There could be no question that this was a case of what has been called aphasia. As far as could be judged, his intellectual functions were not disturbed. Being brought to a new city, he showed within a few days a singular faculty of finding his way home, through the streets, and from long distances, unaided.” Dr. B. has also handed to me a letter from Dr. Jewett, that I had not before seen (dated April 29th, 1868), and in which he says : “ To my request that he would go home with me, and work in my garden, he replied, ‘ No, sir-ee,’ — the largest number of words I have heard him connect since the injury.” — Dr. B. has heard nothing (1870) of the man since the middlo of last sum- mer, but he was then in fine health, and in regard to speech he had decidedly improved. There has never been, he says, any paralysis. . 1868. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiv. 3108. A wrought-iron spike, 3| in. in length, that projected 2 in. from a barn floor, and upon which a man fell head fore- most, 16J ft. The case occurred (Dec. 1868) in the prac- tice of Dr. C., who gave the following histoiy of the case; and, at the request of Dr. J. B. Upham, presented the spike to the museum. (Med. Jour., March 24th, 1870.) The patient was a laborer, twenty-eight years of age. The spike passed through the upper posterior part of the right parietal bone, and carried a portion of it, an inch square, into the substance of the brain, to the depth of about 2 in.; the fracture extending, also, downward nearly to the ear. The man was “ firmly buttoned down to the floor ” by the head of the spike, which measured 1£ in. across ; and, in their attempts to extricate him, two strong685 MORBID ANATOMY. men bad raised the body, and pulled upon it with much force, but in vain. Finally, he was released by splitting away the plank in which the spike was fixed, with an axe and crowbar. When Dr. C. saw the patient, an hour and a half after the accident, the spike was still in the head. This was removed, with the fragments of bone that had been driven into the brain, and others were raised to their proper posi- tion. Immediately the man was able to converse rationally, but there was a complete loss of sensibility and motor power throughout the left side. About seventy-two hours afterward severe pain came on in the left arm and leg, and lasted for half an hour, when almost instantly the sensi- bilitjr returned, though the power of motion never did. The pain subsided, and he continued in a rational state until the ninth day, without inflammatory symptoms, and with a pulse that never rose above 70. On that day por- tions of brain were discharged ; the man sank rapidly, and on the following day he died. On examination after death the brain was found com- pletely broken up, to the extent of 4 in., and to the depth of 2 in. A portion of a two-inch plank, from which the spike pro- jected, has been sent with this last. 1870. Dr. Sherman Cooper, of Claremont, N. H. 3109. The iron portion of a pitchfork, one of the prongs of which passed through a man’s head. The patient was an Irishman, about sixty years of age, who fell, feet foremost, through a barn loft, and upon the fork, Sept. 12th, 1860. One prong entered the right cheek, passed under tbe malar bone, came out a line or two above the coronal suture, about £ in. to the right of the median line, and protruded about 2 in.; the man’s feet barely touching the floor. The concavity of the prong was for- ward and somewhat outward. After the extraction of the prong, which required some force, he walked to a carriage, rode in a drenching rain two miles, and, unaided, alighted and went up one pair of stairs. Dr. Francis A. Howe, of Newburyport, who sent the pitchfork to Dr. Bigelow, and who gives this account of the case, was called, and foundMORBID ANATOMY. 686 him seated in a chair, extremely pallid, bathed in a cold perspiration, conscious, but dull, and with a pulse of 52 and feeble. “ The man did not speak until some time after the fork was withdrawn, and then onty to answer imper- fectly a question, and when pressed for a reply; and he remained exceedingly stupid until he became unconscious.” "Wound in the cheek ragged, and readily admitted the little finger to beneath the arch of the malar bone. The wound in the scalp was small, but bled freely; skull broken, and pushed upward prominently; and a probe was passed downward 2 in. The lower wound was closed, the upper one dressed with cold water; and he was then helped to ascend another flight of stairs. Before he could be got into bed he vomited freely, became greatty prostrated, and shortly afterward almost completely unconscious. “ At midnight violent reaction came on, and he was thought to be dying. His face was much swollen ; respiration stertorous ; eyes injected ; pupils contracted ; surface of the body hot and dry. Pulse 40, hard, and very ‘jerky ; ’ and it was impossible by any effort to arouse him. After vene- section, to the amount of §xxx., the pulse became softer and more frequent, and the breathing less stertorous ; and there were slight indications of returning consciousness.” Pounded ice was ordered to his head ; a large saline cathar- tic was given, and half a grain of Tart, antimony every two hours. The next moi'ning he was much improved, and recognized Dr. H. as he entered the room. Respiration nearty natu- ral. E}res still more injected, and intolerant of light. Pulse 70, but rather hard. Complained much of pain at the top of his head, but said that he was otherwise comfort- able. The cathartic had operated quite freely, and the antimony had caused no nausea. The ice was continued, and the antimony in smaller doses, and less frequently for five days ; and the case was then left in the hands of nature. At the expiration of two weeks he went downstairs, and in three weeks he was able to do light work about the house. The sense of sight and smell were not affected; but,MORBID ANATOMY. 687 having been always a little deaf, he became so much so after the accident that he was unable to hear common con- versation. In August, 1861, Dr. H. saw him again, and when he he was on his way back to Ireland. The hearing was un- improved ; and he was incapacitated, mentalty, from earn- ing a livelihood. He could do very plain work, by the side of another laborer, as shovelling or hoeing; but, if left to himself he would seem to forget his work, and quit it; and he would often wander listlessly about, up and downstairs, out and in doors; often stopping abruptly and for some time, as if in doubt which way he should go. 1861. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 3110. A chaise-hook that was driven through the orbital plate of the frontal bone. A gentleman was driving himself in a buggy, when his horse took fright, and he was thrown out with great violence. His head struck the hook, which was strongly attached by screws to the hard wood frame of the top of the buggy, above and in front, and whicli was driven into the left orbit rather toward the median line. In a few minutes he recovered his consciousness, and, with'a little assistance, walked about one-eighth of a mile, to a house where he was very soon seen by Dr. B. The hook was almost immovably fixed, and nearly or quite three-fourths buried in the orbit; the flat plate, by which it was attached to the frame of the buggy, lying firmly pressed against the front of the orbital ridge, and with the screws projecting from it. An incision was made to the extent of about an inch, and the hook was extracted without any great diffi- culty, though considerable force was required ; after which he was removed to his home in the country, a distance of about five miles. For the first few days there was much pain and swelling about the wound, with some delirium ; and for some weeks a general headache. He was confined to the house only for about ten days, and in about four weeks returned to his business. He suffered more or less from his head, however, for some months, and even now, after the lapse of about eight years, he would not dare, he says, to tax his mind too far. — The point of the hook is688 MORBID ANATOMY. quite blunt, and Dr. B. supposed that it penetrated the frontal sinus, but not the cranial cavity. 1867. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3111. The point of a penknife, | in. in length, that was ex- tracted from the temporal bone. The patient was a little boy, six years old, who fell, with the open knife in his hand, and the point entered the right temple. He ran into the house, with the knife stand- ing off at a right angle ; and, after great force had ineffect- ually been used to extract it, an Irish girl gave a powerful wrench, and broke it off. The whole knife being shown, as well as the point, the blade is seen to be considerably twisted. When Dr. B. saw the child, three hours afterward, there was a puncture in the skin just large enough for the pas- sage of the blade ; and, the bone having been exposed, an opening, and no larger one, was seen in the bone. The bone was then pared away ; and, the blade being exposed, was seized with a pair of wire pliers, and extracted. A jet of blood immediately followed the extraction ; and, after about half a teacupful had been allowed to flow, it stopped spontaneously. The child was about in three or four weeks ; and from first to last never had a bad symptom. 1857. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiv. 3112. The breech-pin of a gun, that was driven deep into the substance of the brain ; recovery, after its removal, rapid and complete. The following history of the case was given by Dr. S., with the specimen, Nov. 16th, 1869 : — “James Getchell, Jr., set. seventeen, was lying on his belly shooting at sea-fowl. The gun at the shoulder, and the eye, as usual, glancing along the barrel. At the dis- charge the pin was blown out, and penetrated the forehead about an inch over the right eye ; the screw by which it is secured to the stock, through the shoulder or process, going in with it. Ho was brought to his home across our harbor, about half a mile, in a semi-conscious state. No part of the pin was visible, and it could be felt only by introducing the finger nearly its whole length ; the projection by which it is attached to the stock lying next the surface. It was extracted with difficulty, and partly owing to theMORBID ANATOMY. (189 screw. It was estimated that about two large spoonfuls of blood and brain followed. The fragments of bone were extracted by forceps ; and he soon recovered, with little suffering; vision in the eye, however, being lost, though the shape of the globe and its motions were preserved. Nothing was required or done except one bleeding, and cathartic. (In those days we bled for everything.)0 The accident happened about the year 1820 or 1821; a year ox- two after, he was lost at sea.” 1869. Dr. Joseph L.

The small end of the pin entered first, and projected immovably about a fourth of an inch near the ear. The iron could not be seen m the socket; but, on passing in an instru- ment, it was seized and extracted. »It required three or four men (Dr. T. says) “ to hold the patient while he was ndei the operation of extraction, and nearly all my strength, winch is not small, to remove the iron.

Dr. Henry Tuck. 3114. A thu d case. Cast of the breech-pin of a gun, that was removed from the right upper maxillary bone, after it had been there for eight years. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. James N. Fra- 44690 MORBID ANATOMY. ser, of St. Johns, Newfoundland, and a full report of it was published in the Med. Jour. (Yol. lxvii. p. 471). The patient was a robust fisherman, thirty years of age ; and the accident was occasioned by the bursting of the gun in his hands on the 14th of Oct., 1848. Violent in- flammation followed, with excruciating pain, and he was confined to the house until the following March, with a constant fetid and purulent discharge from the cheek and nostril, and general debility. In May, 1849, the external wound closed, and so remained until November, 1854, when an opening took place, and discharged pus, with powder and rust. In January, 1855, he had violent hemorrhage from the nostril, and it continued occasionally until April. During all this time he was subject to severe headache, and there was a complete loss of the sense of smell, an occasional dimness of vision, and pain in the right eye, with very serious impairment of his health. In August, 1855, an abscess formed in the cheek, and the pain was more intense than ever. On the 17th of June, 1856, he was seen by Dr. F., and the iron was felt through the opening in the check ; but the mouth could not be opened more than a quarter of an inch, so that the interior could not be examined. The foreign body, the presence of which had never been suspected, was then removed; the screw being imbedded in the antrum, and the part that had been screwed to the back of the stock being in close contact with the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. The length of this last portion was 2| in., and the circumference of the screw 2-] in. After the operation the wound did well, the pain almost wholly subsided, the sense of smell was restored; and, six years afterward, when Dr. S., to whom the cast was sent by Dr. F., heard from him, the man still continued in excellent health, though the action of the lower jaw was still very limited. 1863.

On his admission into the hospital (144, 6), he stated that fom months befoie, whilst standing near a circular saw, a piece of wood flew against his face, inflicted a wound an inch or two in length, and then, as he supposed, fell to the ground. The wound soon very nearly healed ; but an abscess formed behind the ear and discharged ; and there was once a discharge of pus from the meatus. On admis- sion, the cheek was a little thickened, and the foreign body was indistinctly felt. Pain chiefly in the mouth, with a dischaige into it, and a sinus in the cheek and behind the ear. . On the following day the piece of wood was removed, and in a few daj^s he left the hospital quite relieved. During the operation there was a discharge of blood from the ear, and also from the sinus behind it. 1869. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 3116. An iron hay-hook, by which a little girl was transfixed. It was purchased of the family by Dr. Stimson, who was called to the child at the time of the accident, and who removed the hook. The case was attended by Dr. J. P. Maynard, of Ded- ham, and fully reported by him in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lvii. p. 29), with a figure. — The child, eleven years of age, was sliding down a hay-mow, May 9th, 1857, when she fell upon the hook, the point of which passed through the perineum and bladder, and made an external wound, f in. in width upon the left side of the umbilicus. The hook measures from the point to the extremity of the barb, 54 in.; transversely at the barb, nearly 2 in.; and it was supposed to have entered the body to the extent of 11 in. Di. M. saw the child just after the withdrawal, and found her in a state of collapse ; but in the night she began to icdl\. Uigent vomiting protruded a portion of omentum, which was returned with difficulty ; and, the opening being closed, it did not again escape. For a time the urine passed altogether through the wounded bladder, and with it what appeared to be fcecal matter from the small intes- tine ; but this gradually diminished. Small sloughs of cel- lulai tissue, also, for a time came away. On the fifth day violent peritonitis ensued, but this soon subsided ; and on the twentieth day there was severe pain. On the 11th ofMORBID ANATOMY. 692 June the opening in the bladder was touched with the ni- trate of silver; and from that time the urine and fteces passed by the natural outlets. On the 21st she walked and rode out without inconvenience ; and Dr. M. discontinued his attendance. About the 14th of Juty diarrhoea came on, followed by vomiting, and she died on the 23d. On dissection, the laceration of the perineum and the cicatrix near the umbilicus were found, externally. In the upper and anterior part of the vagina was a direct and perfectly cicatrized opening into the bladder, which, when forcibly dilated, was not more than 2 lines in diameter (No. 2482). Upon the vaginal surface it appeared as a marked indentation ; but, upon the vesical, it might readily have been overlooked. The bladder contained a calculus (No. 2689), that seemed to have formed about one of the sloughs from the wounded parts ; also a puriform secre- tion, but no urine nor foeces. The organ was thick and muscular, and upon its inner surface of a dull red color. At the fundus it adhered to the ileum about 3 ft. from the caecum ; and between the two was an opening about 2 lines in diameter. Beneath the cicatrix in the skin a portion of omentum was found (No. 2344), about 4 in. in diameter, and closely adherent to the rectus muscle, through which it had passed, and to the integument. There were no peri- toneal adhesions, except immediately about the wounded parts, and no acute inflammation ; though there were traces of a carbonaceous discoloration of the membrane, that were probably the result of former inflammation, and a trace of pus in the cellular tissue of the pelvis. In connection with the above case, Dr. M. referred to the collection of “ hay-hook cases,” published by Dr. Z. Howe in the Med. Jour., March, 1840 ; to the very remark- able case published by Dr. Sargent, of Worcester, in which a rake-handle passed through the body from the perineum to the clavicle (Amer. Jour, of Med. Sc., Oct., 1853) ; and to the cases of impalement by various means, that Dr. Coale collected from the journals, etc., and published in the Med. Jour. (Vol. lv. p. 387.) 1857. Dr. Jeremy JStimson, of Dedham. These cases of impalement from the sliding down from aMORBID ANATOMY. 693 hay-mow are by no means veiy rare here in New England ; and, though recovery seems to be the law, rather than the exception, the liability to their occurrence cannot be made too generally known in the country. 3117. The iron portion of a hay-hook, similar to the one above described. In this case a boy, about ten years of age, slid from a hay-mow, with his thighs bent upon his body ; and the hook, entering the back part of the thigh, midway, passed through the muscles, under Poupart’s ligament, through the ileum, behind the liver, through the diaphragm, behind the lung, and between the seventh and eighth ribs. The barb, however, caught on the eighth rib, and the point did not penetrate the skin. The boy died in three and a half hours ; and there was found a hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity from a wound in one of the ext. iliac veins. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. God- ding, of Winchendon ; and the hook, which was removed after death, was sent by Dr. H. who assisted at the exam- ination. 1862. Dr. A. Hitchcock, of Fitchburg. 3118. The iron portion of a pitchfork, by one of the prongs of which a boy was transfixed. — He was fourteen }Tears old, and was ascending a hay-mow, with the fork in his hand, when he fell; and, as he slid down the mow, the fork went first, and he came down upon it; the prong entering the perineum, and coming out about an inch to the left of the umbilicus. The prong had been broken and mended, and, not being very strong, it was somewhat bent at the time of the accident. The fork was at once withdrawn; and a small piece of omentum, that protruded, was returned. The boy did perfectly well; and, when the fork was sent to the museum, he was a stout, healthy young man, twenty- three years of age. 1860. Dr. Edward F. Barnes, of 3Tarlboro’. 3119. A rake-handle that entered a man’s scrotum upon the left side, passed in front of the pubes, along the abdominal parietes, and came out at the right hypochondrium, oppo- site the space between the tenth and eleventh ribs. The patient was a laborer, twenty-nine years of age ; and the accident, which happened May 7th, 1860, was caused by his slipping down from a hay-mow upon the rake below.MORBID ANATOMY. 694 Considerable force was required to extract it. Hemorrhage slight. The testicle was completely turned out, and almost denuded ; but was put back, and the wound did well. On the following day there was extensive ecchymosis, and at the end of a week an abscess formed over the wound mid- way ; but the man’s recovery was rapid and complete. (Med. Jour. Vol. lxii. p. 479.) 1860. Dr. II. B. Burnham, Epping, N. II. 3120. An upright round, from the back of a broken chair, upon which a man was pushed down. It entered 1 in. behind the anus, passed through the thyroid foramen, and pro- truded beneath the skin near the pubes ; the extent of pen- etration being about 9 in. The diameter of the stick is §■ in., and from the extremity that entered the body a piece had been slivered off. The patient was carried at once to the hospital (134, 262), and the stick was withdrawn b}^ Dr. II., without any hemorrhage. The accident happened on the 15th of April. On the 17th a piece of cloth was removed, and is shown with the stick. On the 19th large incisions were made in front; the parts beneath being inflamed and sloughy ; and on the 22d he died. — The peritoneum was quite healthy ; but there was erysipelatous cellulitis, and in one lung nu- merous pyemic deposits. (Med. Jour., Aug. 6th, 1868.) 1868. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 3121. A thick, sharp-pointed splinter of wood, 14 in. long, and a slender piece § in. long ; removed in an operation for fistula in ano. The patient was a man, twent3r-eight years old. Three mouths before, a board, upon which he was lying, broke, and sharp pain was instantly felt. Three weeks afterward the part was lanced, and there had been a discharge from that time. No opening was found by Dr. B. into the intestine ; and the patient was soon well. (Hospital, 75, 24.) 1857. * Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3122. A piece of rough pine stick, 3$ in. long, and nearly £ in. wide at the largest part. From a little boy, seven years old, who complained that he had fallen and hurt his hip. His mother, who was a woman of sufficient intelligence, examined it carefully, butMORBID ANATOMY. 695 found nothing, — no blood and no wound ; and be was not kept from his school or play. Five weeks afterward the stick was felt beneath the skin, just above and parallel to the groin ; the child having complained of soreness there. Dr. H., being consulted, removed the foreign body, and the child did well; but he was as unable as the mother had been to discover the point of entrance. 1859. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 3123. An irregular mass of rock, weighing 2 lbs. 5 J oz. ; diam- eters about 7J in., 4J in., and 2 in. Driven into the front part of the thigh of an Irishman who was blasting rocks ; and so buried in the flesh as not to be seen. Dr. C. en- larged the opening and removed the stone. Bleeding very slight, and pain not very great; no collapse. 1861. Dr. Benj. E. Cotting, of Roxbury. 3124. Portions of several needles that were removed from the calf of the leg of a hysterical girl; some before, and others after her entrance into the hospital (95, 252). There were points upon all of them ; and they were undoubtedly intro- duced by the patient herself. 1868. Dr. II. G. Clark. 3125. A musket-ball, and probably a round one, removed suc- cessfully from the frontal sinus, June 26th, 1863, by Dr. H., when he had charge of the St. James Hospital, in New Orleans. From a soldier, who was wounded in an assault on Port . Hudson on the 14th. There was an opening, large enough to admit a director, over the eyebrow, and a scar near its outer extremity. A small portion of bone is imbedded in the ball. 1867. Dr. J. Homans. Rifle, or musket balls, that were collected by Dr. B., who served in the army during the greater part of the Civil War. 1863. Dr. Henry Bryant. 3126. 1. A shapeless mass of lead, from the cavity of the hip- joint, after death. The ball struck the middle of the thigh upon its outer face, split the shaft of the femur throughout, and then apparently followed up the bone, which was entirely comminuted for 6 in. below the head. Both tro- chanters were broken off, and the head and neck split into696 MORBID ANATOMY. pieces, some of which were larger than the ball. This was the worst case of gun-shot injury that Dr. B. saw during the war. 3127. 2. A conical ball, very little bruised. It entered the outside of the left thigh, about 2 in. above the knee-joint, and passed out on the inner face, about an inch lower down ; then entering the right thigh upon its inner face, and a little above the centre of the condyle, it passed be- tween the integuments and the patella, across the joint, and was taken out near the head of the fibula, with four pieces of cloth, which are shown with the ball. Result, fatal. 3128. 3. A shapeless mass of lead. The ball entered the upper back part of the right arm ; fractured the head of the hu- merus, acromion process, and outer third of the clavicle, passed behind the mastoid muscle, and'in front of the tra- chea, and was extracted from the left shoulder, just beneath the integument. 3129. 4. A round ball, quite bruised to about one-third of its extent. Extracted from the left shoulder. Fracture of the acromion and head of the humerus. Recovery. 3130. 5. A ball, considerably bruised ; and to the part that is most so a piece of bone is still firmly adherent. It entered the thigh upon its outer face, about 2 in. above the knee, and was extracted from just behind the outer ankle. Re- covery. 3131. 6. One-half or more, of a round ball; the flattened surface being nearly smooth. It entered near the great trochanter, and was extracted from the back of the thigh, midway. 3132. A buck-shot, considerably flattened, with three thick- nesses of flannel, removed by Dr. W. L. Bond, of Charles- town, from just above the elbow of a soldier, who was wounded at Port Hudson. 1868.

The following table gives the measurement of most of the above specimens. To get the internal capacity of the skull, it was filled with shot (No. 2 b), and these were then transferred to a tin canister; the shot being well shaken and rammed down in each. The space that 45MISCELLANY. 706 they occupied was then indicated by a wooden cylinder, that was fitted to the canister, and graduated to half an an inch. No. 3169 was measured with rice. The lonsritu- o dinal diameter shows the distance from a point about 1 in. above the fronto-nasal suture, to the most prominent point of the occiput, upon the median line. The next column gives the distance from this last point to the anterior edge of the foramen magnum. To get- this measurement, and to which Dr. Wyman attaches so much importance in his “ Observations on Crania,” the two points that indicate the long, diameter were brought very nearly, if not exactly, into a horizontal line ; plumb lines were then dropped to the ant. edge of the foramen and the post, point of the occi- put, and the distance between the two was measured. This was the method used by Dr. W. for the occipital region; and by a very simple and ingenious contrivance, he made his measurements with great accuracy. It was very desirable to get this measurement in the case of the casts that were sent by Dr. Morton to Dr. Warren, as typ- ical specimens; and it was taken, as the position of the condyles showed pretty exactly where the anterior edge of the foramen would have been. The last column shows the distance, over the top of the skull, from the fronto- nasal suture to the posterior edge of the foramen magnum. Int. Long. Occiput. • No. capac- ity. diame- ter. vertex.

Jan. 15th, 1870, and two weeks after it had been amputated for caries of the wrist-joint. A saturated solution of the chloride of sodium, in pure glycerine was made without heat, and with a little of the chloride in excess. The hand having then been dissected, every part of it was very thorougly washed with the solu- tion, and it was then laid away for three or four weeks, in a cloth saturated with the same ; the process being repeat- ed more or less thoroughly once or twice, at intervals of730 appendix. about a week, and the tendons being wet with pure glycer- ine if they became at all dry. The above is one of several processes that are original with himself, and with which Dr. D. is now experimenting in the preparation of the soft parts. 1870. Dr. Thomas Dwight, Jr. 3642.

Carpenter, of Mansfield. 3645. A drawing in water-colors, of a new-born child, and showing a black discoloration of the left upper extremity. From a photograph. The mother was a half-witted, Irish girl, and nothing was known of her situation until shorty before her confine- ment. The case occurred in the practice of Dr. G. J. Arnold, of Roxbury. (Med. Jour. Yol. lxxiv. p. 371.) The discoloration began not far above the wrist, and extended upwards as far as the neck, over the whole scap- ular region, and somewhat upon the chest. The color was an intensely dark-brown ; and to a very considerable ex- tent, and especially upon the arm, it was as black as the skin of the blackest negro. Upon the back of the elbow, only, the color was less intense. Where the color was theAPPENDIX. 731 darkest the surface was uneven, more or less nodulated, and felt, on pinching it up, thickened and quite firm. The margin between the discolored and natural skin was almost continuously of a light-brown color, quite definite in ex- tent, generally about 2 lines, or more, in width; but upon the chest, and to a small extent, it was about two-thirds of an inch in width. About the top of the shoulder there was quite a development of soft hair. Upon the back of the pelvis, and left side of the trunk, there was a patch equal to an inch or more in diameter, as black as the above, and with hair upon the surface ; also a patch upon the right thigh, about half as large. Over the trunk and limbs were scattered numerous spots, of a comparatively light-brown color, generally 2 lines, or more, in diameter, and that, individually, would have been called moles. Only one of these last was found upon the head, and that was upon the upper lip, and very pale. 1870. Mr. W. P. Bolles, med. student. 3646. A second collection of double trout, recently hatched, and from the establishment, in Barnstable, already referred to (No. 903). On comparing them together, the following varieties were observed : In one there were two heads and two tails, but the bodies are fused. — In six the two individuals were connected only by the umbilical vesicle. In one of these, one was very much atrophied, and the other largely devel- oped ; in another there was also a very considerable dis- proportion, and the same was observed, more or less, in some of the other varieties. In another specimen of the above variety, one was single, but had no eyes ; the other divided anteriorly, and one head had two e}res, but the other had none. — One had two heads, with four eyes, but was otherwise single. — Six were united by the posterior portion of the body, or by the tails only, and otherwise separate or double. In one specimen one is very large, and the other much atrophied. In another specimen of the last variety, one head has two eyes, and a central one between them. In three other specimens of the same vari- ety, one head has two eyes, and the other four.—In one specimen the body is single posteriorly, but with two cau-732 APPENDIX. dal fins; anteriorly, it is triple, and each of the three heads has two eyes. In another, of the same variety, one of the heads has one eye only. In another of the same the central head has two eyes ; one of the others has a ru- dimentary eye, and the third has none. — In another variety the head and body are single, but the tail is double. — One specimen shows a very strong curvature, as was the case with several that were received with the first collection. The different varieties are shown in separate tube phials. 18 Dr. A. Coolidge. 3647.

A piece of bone, removed from the cranium, by trephine ; and connected with it a broken fragment, nearly as large as the thumb-nail. From a man, set. twenty-seven years, and who entered the hospital Aug. 13th, 1867 (77, 2), in a state of insensi- bility and collapse, with a contusion over the left temple, and a small punctured wound in the centre ; the accident having probably happened during the previous night. On incision, a defined opening was found in the skull, with a discharge of brain. A piece of bone having then been removed by the trephine, there was found, after some examination of the part, the small fractured portion pro- jecting inward, and hinged to the inner surface of the bone. At the time of the operation, and subsequently, there was much hemorrhage, with much discharge of brain, and much motion of the left lower extremity, but none of the right side of the body ; and on the evening of the 15th the man died. — On dissection, an extensive effusion of blood was found into the membranes. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3649. Cast of the forearm and hand, to show the appearancesAPPENDIX. 733 in case of transverse fracture of both bones, just above the wrist-joint. The patient was a man, fifty-two years of age, who entered the hospital Oct. 21st (141, 235). There were other serious injuries, and he remained until the 3d of Feb. The cast was taken, just before he left the hospital, by Mr. Henry T. Boutwell, one of the house-pupils ; the deformity, at that time, being of course, much less than at first. 1870. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3650. Fracture of the neck of the femur, with inversion. The following history of this case, with remarks upon it, is from Dr. Bigelow’s work of Dislocation and Fracture of the Hip (1869) : — “ This accident is of rare occurrence. Smith and Ham- ilton each cite but one case. Indeed, the structure of the bone, as has been shown, is such as to insure an almost uniform eversion of the shaft. A specimen from a dissect- ing room has enabled me to examine this rare lesion, and to identify the conditions under which it probably occurred. In this subject, an old woman, the limb was flexed a little, shortened to the extent of 3 in., and inverted so that the patella faced inward; the limb was in slight abduction, and could be neither everted nor brought to the median line. The trochanter was felt to be much thickened. Upon examination of this exceptional specimen, the neck of the bone was found to be firmly united at right angles with the shaft, which was split open, and spread so widely as to receive the whole impacted neck, leaving a fissure an inch or more long, and a quarter of an inch wide between the anterior wall and the neck, and extending nearly to the outer wall of the shaft, while another similar fissure exists behind the neck. The principal posterior fragment com- prised the two trochanters, with the intertrochanteric ridge, and also a large fragment of the external portion of the shaft, — while above, the region of the great trochanter seemed to have been comminuted, and driven downward and inward. Anteriorly, the fracture had occurred, as usual in impacted fracture, along the oblique spiral line, although differing from that injury ; the neck being deeply driven in behind this wall, from which it had slipped,734 APPENDIX. instead of turning upon it as a hinge. The whole upper part of the bone, above the trochanter minor, seemed to have been bent inward, so that the posterior intertrochan- teric line, instead of inclining obliquely to the axis of the shaft, was vertical. The inversion was due to the extent of the comminution, which had separated the walls of the shaft so as to receive in the interval the -whole neck, in- stead of the posterior wall only, as commonly occurs, thus producing an anterior as well as a posterior impaction. The shortening resulted both from the horizontal position of the neck, and from an additional upward displacement of the shaft, caused by the comminution. A good deal of callus had been thrown out in various directions, and the movements of the limb must have been quite restricted. A curious spicula stood at right angles with the shaft, near the lesser trochanter, and may have been a displaced frag- ment, or the ossified insertion of the psoas tendon. The same bony spicula exists in another specimen before me, and is not uncommon. “In examining the accompanying illustrations (of which there are two), it will be seen that the intertrochanteric ridge is split off, as often happens, but in this it has carried with it the outer and posterior walls of the shaft, with the two trochanters. “ Smith (Treatise on Fractures, etc., Dublin) cites a similar case of inversion (Case xlvi.), which the accompa- nying figure shows to have resulted from a similar cause. The posterior intertrochanteric ridge, with the greater part of the two trochanters, has been detached in a mass, and so widely that the neck of the bone has slipped from its anterior hinge. In both specimens the impaction is arrested near the outer wall of the shaft. The entire neck in my specimen can be seen through the lateral fissures, while in that of Smith its extremity is detected through an interval of the fragments, near' the great trochanter. A similar specimen, numbered 248, in the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia, shows neither inversion nor eversion.” 1870. Dr. H. J. Bigeloiv. 3651. Fracture of the neck of the femur, within the capsule.

From an old man, seventy-five years of age, who fell down two steps on the 9th of Nov., 1858. On the follow- ing Christmas he could go from one room to another; and he was afterwards able to walk an eighth of a mile, with the aid of two canes, and until he lost his eyesight.

A patella, fractured transversely, and very closely united by fibrous fissue. —From a gentleman, fifty-three years of age. When nine years old he was thrown from a wagon, and struck his patella upon a stone with great violence. The knee was always perfectly stiff, and appeared, after death, to be completely anchylosed. 1870. Dr. William Ingalls. 3653. Nearly one-half of the outer portion of the right astraga- lus, broken off vertically, and removed. From a man, thirty years of age, who was thrown from a wagon in Dec., 1857. When Dr. G. saw him, there were pain and swelling about the ankle, with slight crepitus. The foot was bent forcibly inwards, as in varus, and the toes pointed downwards ; depression over the dorsum of the foot; and over the external malleolus an opening of the size of a pea, from which blood issued. The lower end of the tibia was broken, but the fibula was uninjured. In front of the lower end of the tibia, anteriorly, there was felt to be a cavity, and about over the cuboid bone was felt the dis- placed portion of astragalus; the integuments being stretched and thin. The bone was at once removed; and though he had, within a fortnight, two attacks of inflammation, that went on to suppuration, he finally did well, and has for some years moved about as freely as any man. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3654. A portion of the pelvis, with the upper part of the femur, from a case of old dislocation into the foramen ovale. I rom a man, who fell from a great height, whilst intoxi- cated, and was subsequently under the care of Dr. A. B.736 appendix. Bancroft, of Chelsea. About three months after the acci- dent Dr. Gay saw the patient, and found the thigh flexed, the knee flexed, abducted and everted, and the limb lengthened at least 2 in. The great trochanter was de- pressed, with a hollowing in that region ; and there was a visible roundness between the perineum and the small trochanter, with tension of the muscles of the inner and upper part of the thigh. The reduction was effected with much difficulty , the knee springing up a little, on pressure downwards, after the operation, and the limb being length- ened about half an inch. After the operation the bone was not kept in place ; and a few weeks afterward the man died with a large abscess upon the back of the hip and thigh. The parts having been removed, entire, were brought to Dr. B. for examination. The head of the femur lay behind the acetabulum, and upon the pyriformis muscle. The obturator int. was lacerated, and had about disappeared. When the head of the bone was placed in the thyroid fora- men, it was beneath some of the fibres of the obturator ext., and also beneath the pectineus. The inner band of the Y ligament remained, with a small portion of the external band, and was very much thickened ; and, other- wise, the whole capsular ligament was torn through, so that only shreds of it were to be seen. The ligamentum teres had disappeared; the whole inner surface of the acetabulum was more or less abraded, and the lower mar- gin was in a great measure destroyed. One third or more of the head of the femur is also destroyed as by caries, and the remainder of the articular surface is smooth, but entirely denuded of cartilage. The indications of an attempt to form a new socket are very marked ; there being a very thick mass of fibrous tissue, with some ossific deposit along most of the margin of the thyroid foramen, toward the rami of the pubes and ischium, and some rough ossific deposit upon the body of this last, with more or less of the same elsewhere. There is no deposit of new bone, however, upon the head or neck of the femur. Upon the dorsum of the ilium, and where the head rested, the737 appendix. smface of the bone is slightly roughened. — Specimen in spirit, and prepared by Dr. H. H. A. Beach. 1870. Dr. H. J. Bigelow. 3655. A large portion of the calvaria, very curiously and ex- tensively eroded upon both surfaces, and, to more or less extent in different parts, continuously. At some points the bone is perforated. Very little proper caries; no thickening, and nowhere any deposit of new bone. The dura mater was somewhat adherent, but there was no other disease. 1869. Dr. II. H. A. Beach. 3656. A portion of the spine, showing extensive caries of the two last dorsal, and two first lumbar vertebrae; from a case of aneurism. (Hospital, 287, 33.) Dissected by Mr. James J. Putnam, one of the house-pupils; and prepared Dr. T. Dwight, Jr., to show the prominence of the intervertebral substances, with very little shrinking. 1870. Dr. F. Minot. 3657. The humerus in two portions, with extensive caries, and necrosis of the lower portion. biom a man, set. twenty-six years, who entered the hos- pital July 15th, 1858 (79, 168), with a large abscess about the shoulder. Five weeks before, after working hard, he was attacked with constitutional symptoms, and inflamma- tion followed. He had had an abscess in the same part fi\ e 3 eais before, but no further trouble from it after it had discharged. On the 17th an opening was made, and the discharge was profuse. On the 20th pain came on about the elbow, and became afterwards excruciating, with swell- ing. Aug. 6th a deep incision was made; very offensive pus was discharged, and the bone was felt entirely denuded as far us the finger could reach. On the 26th, the bone gave way; and on the 28th the limb was removed at the shoulder joint. The hemorrhage was considerable; but the man did well, and was discharged on the 27th of Octo- ber. The upper fragment is 7£ in. in length, extensively absorbed towards its lower extremity, rough from caries, and tapering almost to a point. Otherwise it is irregular upon the surface, with numerous- large pores, but without 47APPENDIX. 738 much caries, though an opening of some size leads into the interior of the bone, which looks hollowed out as if by the abscess. The head of the bone is sufficiently healthy. The lower fragment is 4| in. in length, and a large portion of it is exfoliating, though still firmly connected. Surface of the dead portion1 partly quite smooth and unchanged, but partly porous as from preliminary inflammation. Ar- ticular surface, and the bone just above the joint, exten- sively carious. 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 3658. Disease of the radius. — The bone, midway, is very much enlarged, rough upon the surface, and shows several open- ings that communicate with a central cavity, in which is a sequestrum that must be about 3 in. in length. The en- largement is fusiform, and the whole bone is more or less enlarged, excepting the very upper extremity. The ulna and lower part of the humerus are healthy; but Dr. L. found some disease of the carpal bones. From a healthy man, fifty-five years of age, who in Feb- ruary, 1868, had a very severe attack of inflammation of, or about, the bone. In May, Dr. L. saw him, and opened the parts freely, with great relief; but extensive necrosis took place. In December, 1869, there was a verj' copious hemorrhage, and on the 20th the limb was amputated above the elbow. On examination, it was found greatly swollen, and infiltrated with serum and blood ; and near the wrist the radial artery had been completely severed by the sharp and pointed extremity of the sequestrum. Re- sult successful. 1870. Dr. G. H. Lyman. 3659. About If in. of the upper extremity of the femur, removed during life. Head of the bone nearly destroyed by caries ; surface rough, as is the neck in part. Structure very light; no new growth. From a delicate little boy, nine years old, who entered the hospital April 22d, 1857 (75, 95). Duration of disease three years; and abscesses the last eight months. Limb drawn up and flexed, and extension gave great pain. Oct. 26th, shortening about 3 in.; several extensive fistulae; and the head of the bone was felt denuded. The general739 APPENDIX. health, however, wa9 better. Oct. 31st the bone was removed, and on the 16th of Nov. the boy died. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3660. Photograph of a little girl, seven years of age, and show- ing the thigh bent to a right angle, the effects of hip disease. When Dr. B. saw her last November, there seemed to be anchylosis ; but, under ether, there was just a perceptible motion. The disease began about four and a half years before. For about two years it was active, and afterward a subsidence, so that there had been no pain for several months, and she was able to go about on crutches. Gen- eral health always delicate. The rectus, tensor vaginae femoris, sartorius and adductor longus were divided, and immediately afterward the adhesions were broken down, so that the angle of flexion was reduced to about 45°; and this was the only operation that was performed. For the next two or three months an apparatus was kept applied ; and, at the end of that time, the limb was perfectly straight. For some weeks past (April 12th) she has been able to walk without either crutch or cane, and there is consider- able motion in the joint. Photograph of the above case, after treatment; and in this figure, as well as in the last, the dress has been removed so as to show the exact condition of the limb. 1870. Dr. Buckminster Brown. 3661. A sequestrum, from a femur, that had been amputated; 9 in. in length, and involving a large part of the circum- ference of the bone. 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 3662. Excision of the knee-joint; the patella adhering to the outer condyle. — The patient, set. eleven years, entered the hospital Aug. 23d (142, 13). Duration of disease one year ; and knee bent to an angle of about 45°. Operation Oct. 20tli; followed by incessant "Vomiting, and death in about forty-eight hours. The whole joint was perfectly disorganized. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3663. One of the small cuneiform bones from the foot, that is extensively and deeply carious ; and, being perfectly loose, was readily picked out. The disease, which was chronic,APPENDIX. 740 was confined to this bone; and the patient (a man in the hospital) was at once relieved. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3664. Portion of the rib of an ox, from Texas; with a hole through it, about 2£ in. by 1 in. in extent. Outline regu- lar, and no appearance of a former injury. 1870. Dr. J. Wyman. 3665. A portion of the lower jaw, removed for what was supposed, before the operation, to be an encephaloid disease. From a woman, set. sixty years, who entered the hospi- . tal Nov. 29th, 1856 (73, 200). When eighteen years old she had a disease of the jaw ; a fungoid mass as large as a hen’s egg was removed, and the bone was scraped. From that time she had no further trouble until Jan. 1st, 1856, when she felt a sudden snap or tearing sensation along the under and posterior surface of the chin. In a day or two a small tumor appeared, and became as hard as bone; and in August it appeared in the mouth. On examination, a rounded and very defined tumor was found in the place of the incisor teeth, of a deep red color, exquisitely tender, and looking like an abscess that was ready to burst. Externally, there was a slight ful- ness ; and the tumor appeared behind the jaw, but not in front. On being opened, it discharged blood very freely, but nothing more. The bone was then (29th) removed between the canine and bicuspid teeth, on each side, and the hemorrhage was profuse ; but on the 16th of Dec. the patient left the hospital, and several years afterwards, when she was heard from, nothing was said of any return of the disease. The bone is enlarged upon each side of the median line, and looks as if it had been absorbed by a tumor that had formed in its substance. A large cavity is the result, of which the inner surface is irregular, but well defined, and of good consistence. Superiorly, it is uncovered ; lateral parietes thin, and to a large extent deficient; base thin, and below it is a second cavity, of considerable size, and almost but not quite opening into the one above. Beyond741 APPENDIX. the disease the bone looks quite healthy ; and there is no- where any new deposit. 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 3666. A hollow shell of bone, about the size of an English walnut, and that enclosed a tumor, that was removed from the upper jaw. The parietes are very thin, deficient to a considerable extent, and for the most part coarsely cribri- form. Structure compact. The patient was a perfectly healthy man, forty-five years of age, and entered the hospital March 25th, 1857 (75, 74). Tumor upon the outside of the gum, and above the first upper bicuspid tooth ; well defined, smooth, rounded, hard and painless. It had existed for two and a half years, “ felt like gristle,” and enlarged very slowly. About six weeks before entrance, on exposure to a cold wind, he felt a sharp pain in it, and four teeth were removed, but with- out relief. On the day of his admission the tumor was removed ; in two weeks he left the hospital, and he now (1870) reports that he has never had any return of the disease. The tumor was regarded as fibro-plastic. 1869. Dr. G. H. Gay. 3667. The lower 6£ in. of the femur, that looks as if it had been surrounded by some malignant growth, to the extent of about 5 in. The surface is rough, and superficially absorbed ; and to some extent posteriorly there is the short, bristly growth, perpendicular to the surface, that is so often seen in malignant disease. Above and below the seat of disease there is a periosteal deposit, that is raised from the surface, as if it had been continued over some morbid growth; and to a considerable extent the bony fibres are arranged with great regularity perpendicular to the surface of the bone, as those are that arise from the . bone itself. 1869. Dr. G. II. Gay. 3668. Cast of an amputation at the right ankle-joint, performed by the method of M. Soupart (A. Guerin. Elements de Chirurgie Operatoire, fig. 105 ; 3d ed. Paris, 1864). The patient was forty years old ; and the operation was performed for an incurable ulcer of the foot, of eleven years’ duration. Cast taken eight weeks after the opera-APPENDIX. 742 tion. In a case already reported (No. 1626) the same amputation bad been performed. 1870. Dr. E. M. Hodges. 3669. A portion of the heart, showing a clot adherent to the mitral valve, and that was the cause of instantaneous death. From a woman, set. fifly-eight years, who was recovering from a mild attack of pneumonia, and had had no cardiac affection previously, so far as known. She awoke in the night, and apparently as well as she had been ; asked what o’clock it was, and died instantly. The clot was about as large as the top of the thumb; and acted, as Dr. E. thought, like a ball valve, to prevent the passage of the blood. It had evidently formed before death, though only recently ; surface partially decolorized, and the interior, on incision, resembled the lees of red wine. The mitral valve was somewhat diseased ; but the heart was otherwise healthy; and the lungs, though not hepatized, showed that they had been inflamed. 1870. Dr. C. Ellis. 3670. A large mass of a white, dryish, crumbling material, and partly cretaceous, in the place of the bronchial glands. Cut open and dried; with a portion of the trachea and bronchi. From a woman who had disease of the heart. 1869. Dr. H. H. A. Beach. 3671. Photograph of a case of elephantiasis Arabum, for which amputation was performed by Dr. S., at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the thigh. The patient was a woman, fifty years of age, and the disease had been coming on for a little more than sixjTears ; having commenced with an attack of erysipelas in the foot, after working very hard in a damp cellar. There was ulceration upon the inside of the leg, with a watery dis- charge ; and last July a large abscess formed upon the upper part of the leg, that nearly proved fatal. The limb was generally much congested, and very sensitive, so that opiates were required. At the time of the operation, which was done at the request of the patient, the ankle measured 2 ft. 1J iu. in circumference; the calf of the743 APPENDIX. leg, 3 ft. 14 in.; two inches above the knee, 34 ft., and at the line of amputation, 2J ft. Weight of the limb after removal, 100 lbs. Very little blood was lost, and the oper- ation was well borne; but soon after the woman was placed in bed, a sudden pallor came over her, and she died in an instant. Dr. J. Collins Warren, of this city, examined a portion of the fresh tissue, and found the cutis vera and subcuta- neous tissue blended and very much thickened by a dense fibrous tissue, that seemed to arise from the outer coats of the blood-vessels, which were very numerous and large. There were also vessels that appeared like enlarged lym- phatics. The papillae were much enlarged, but the hair follicles and sebaceous glands were not seen; and there were only traces of the sweat glands, with one duct, so far as seen. The case will be published, in full, by Dr. S., in the Amer. Jour, of Med. Sciences. 1870. Dr. Isaac Smith, Jr., of Fall River. 3672. The trachea dried, and showing a piece of bone, as large as the top of the little finger, impacted in the right primary bronchus. The patient was a farmer, sixty-seven years of age, and quite healthy, though with an occasional cough. On the 14th of Febi’uary he suddenly choked whilst eating, and coughed violently. Through the day the cough was almost incessant, and it continued more or less so as long as he lived ; being much worse when lying down, and less during the day. Breathing short, difficult, and rattling; but he did his usual work, and, on the 27th, walked to church and back, — a distance of two miles. On the 2d of March he gave up his work, and on the 6th he died. Dr. A. saw him on the afternoon of the 5th, and found him in a state of approaching collapse, and with dyspnoea, but no hoarse- ness. Over the whole of the right side there were subcrep- itant rales, except below the scapula, where the air did not seem to enter; and over the whole right back there was dulness on percussion. — On dissection, there were found quite a number of small tubercular-looking deposits in the right lung, and most of them softened ; but, as there was744 APPENDIX. nothing of the kind in the left lung, the disease may have been recent, and connected with the obstruction in the bronchus, as in the cases described by Dr. Ellis. (Med Jour. Vol. lv. p. 356.) 1870. Dr. Z. B. Adams, of Framingham. 3673. A stone from the stomach of a fish, that was taken in a harbor on the west coast of Mexico. Its length is 12 in., its greatest width 6 in., and its thickness, 2£°in.; weight,’ 6 lbs. 14 oz. (avoir.) Surface generally smooth, but to a considerable extent and deeply eroded by shell-fish. The fish was taken about the year 1854, on board the U. S. Ship Portsmouth, and “ was about 4 ft. long, stout and thick, with small teeth, and scales as large as the thumb- nail ; name not known.” Dr. B. did not see the fish opened, but the stone was brought to him as soon as it was iemo\ed. The condition of the stomach was not observed. To explain the fact Dr. B. states that the stones upon the shelving coast, where the fish was taken, were covered with soft star-fishes, and the stone was probably swallowed with the food. 1870. Isaac Brinckerhoff, M. D., Surgeon U. S. JV. 3674. Photograph of a child, set. three years and three months, showing the abdomen immensely distended, and with great general emaciation.'—I he enlargement was first noticed last June, and it died in February. There was no pain, and no vomiting nor loss of appetite until the last few days. On dissection, a defined, rounded tumor was found, that weighed 15 lbs. Upon the surface a considerable portion of one of the kidneys was seen, and from this organ the morbid growth seemed to have originated ; the organ, so far as it appeared, being perfectly healthy, but soon entirely lost in the tumor. The structure of this last varied in different parts, but it generally had a cancerous appear- ance, and in some parts this was strongly marked. Micro- scopically, however, there was some difference of opinion. (Med. Jour., April 7th, 1870.) 1870. Dr. Charles Goodwin, of Wakefield. 3675. A large, rounded, urinary calculus, nearly covered with745 APPENDIX. very prominent and pointed groups of small nodules, and removed by the lateral operation, Dr. Bigeloiv. It measures about 2 in. by If in., and weighed 43£ dwts., — nearty 2J oz. avoir. On section, an oval nucleus is seen, £ in. in length, and with regular, concentric laminae. The rest is also laminated, but the lines are very irregular and wavy, as in the mulberry calculus. The color is a reddish brown, the structure compact, and the internal surface of one-half has been polished. Dr. White reports the chemical composition as follows : “ Nucleus and greater portion of bulk, uric acid. Oxalate of lime the greater proportion of external layers, and to some extent throughout body of calculus.” A thin and comparatively light-colored deposit over a large part of the external surface also consists of uric acid and oxalate of lime. The patient was a healthy old man, about seventy-three years of age. For three or four years he had had some urinary symptoms, and for the last few months they had increased so that, as his wife finally said, he would die from his pain if he was not relieved. On passing the sound, Dr. B. recognized a'mulberry calculus, by the hard- ness and the asperities upon the surface ; but it was only felt when the point of the instrument was brought into contact with the anterior parietes of the bladder. The stone was removed, by the lateral operation, about the last of March, and the patient died, from the shock to his sys- tem, in eighteen hours. Examination of the body not allowed. Upon the surface of the stone is a pretty well defined an- nular depression, that divides it into nearly two equal parts, and of which one was probably contained within a pouch, whilst the groove was formed by its neck. As the stone was so very rough, Dr. B% thought the acute symptoms would have been of longer duration, if it had been free in the bladder. 1870. Dr. II. J. Bigelow. 3676. A calculus, removed by the lateral operation. It is of a regular, elongated form, in. in length, and f in. in diam- eter. On section, the structure is mainly laminated and746 APPENDIX. compact; but upon more than one-half of the surface there is an addition of a coarse deposit, not laminated, quite defined, and varying from about * to J in. in thickness. Dr. TV hite finds the body of the stone to consist of uric acid and ur. of ammonia, with a little ox. and phosph. of lime. The outgrowth consists of carb. and phosph. of lime, with triple phosph. of ammonia and magnesia. The external surface is rough or granulated, corresponding to the outgrowth, and the rest is smooth. The patient was a little boy, six years old, who was sent to the hospital Feb. 23d, from an almshouse in the country, with club foot (142, 121). March 19th it was reported that from the time of admission he had wet his bed in the night; and a woman who brought him to the hospital stated that he had had the same trouble so long as he had been at the almshouse. Urine passed frequently, with con- sideiable pain, and sometimes it stopped ; turbid in appear- ance, and contained pus, with the triple phosphate. On the 27th the calculus was felt, and on the 30th it was removed. April 13th: since the operation the urine has passed almost wholly through the wound, but since yester- day almost wholly by the urethra. 29th: the child is in every way doing well. 1870. Dr. R. M. Hodges. 3G77. A prolapsed uterus, of which casts have been taken. (No. 2/h6.) It has been prepared by Dr. B., according to the method of M. Van Vetter, of Boulogne, and seems likely to retain its natural suppleness, and without decom- position. The organ having been drawn up so as to fairly expose the fundus and body, a probe is found to enter about 5 in. from the os, and shows that there is elongation as well as prolapse. The relations of the organ to the bladder, and also to the peritoneum, anteriorly and posteriori}', are perfectly represented in one of Cruveilhier’s figures (Anat. Path. Liv. xvi. pi. 4) ; and a considerable portion of each of the peritoneal protrusions, and also of the blad- der, would have been removed, if a transverse incision had been made directly through the upper part of what would generally have been called the prolapsed uterus. ThereAPPENDIX. 747 seem to be two small fibroid tumors of the womb, but they are probably of no account. The preparation above referred to, consists of glycerine 7 oz., brown sugar 1 oz., and nitrate of potash £ oz.; but, as Dr. B. finds that the specimen is liable to mould, he adds of pure carbolic acid, §ij. The specimen is saturated with this preparation for ten or fourteen days, and then hung up to drip in a loosely covered jar, and in a warm and dry place. 1870. Dr. H. II. A. Beach. 3678. Cast of the thumb, showing an enchondromatous tumor in front of the last phalanx, and about the size of a large nutmeg. — The patient was a woman, twenty-five years of age, who entered the hospital Jan. 7th (143, 112). Tumor of two and a half years’ duration; of a regular, rounded form, translucent, soft, though not fluctuating, painless, and only interfering mechanically with the motion of the joint. Growth slow at first, but more rapid the last year. It was very easily removed by Dr. Cabot, and the patient left on the 13th, with the wound nearly healed. — Cast taken by Mr. T., one of the house-pupils. 1870. Mr. Frederick H. Thompson, tried, student. 36/9. Eight and a half inches of the humerus, removed at the shoulder-joint, for neuralgia. The patient was an active and powerful man, seventy- one years of age, and served as an artillerist in the Civil M ar. In 1864 his hand was severely injured by the pre- mature discharge of a cannon, and was amputated at the wrist-joint. Subsequently the forearm was amputated twice, and the arm twice, for the intense and almost con- stant pain that he suffered, not in the limb that remained, but in the hand and fingers that had been removed ; eight or nine grains of morphine being injected subcutaneously and daily, before Dr. H.’s operation, — and the left arm being scarred from the deltoid to the wrist. Since the last amputation of the arm, the nerves, also, had been dissected out from near the deltoid attachment; and, on dissection of the stump, since the last operation, the only nerve that Dr. II. could find, was the musculo-spiral. About a year after the first operation the humerus was748 APPENDIX. fractured ; and Dr. II. supposed that some nervous filament may have been involved between the fragments, and been the cause of the neuralgia. After the fracture, also, there appeared a pulsating tumor below the clavicle. Dr. H. found it to be ill defined, not far from the size of a small lemon, and situated beneath the pectoral muscle, but not rising above the clavicle. He regarded it as an aneurism, and thought that it might perhaps explain the pain. On the 5th of April he removed the stump, according to Baron Larrey’s method. Twenty ligatures were required; the wound was washed with alcohol, and dressed with dry charpie. Hardly a drachm of pus was formed, and on the sixth day the edges of the wound had united, except where the ligatures hung out. On the day after the operation, seven grains of morphine were required for the pain, and taken by the mouth ; afterwards onty one grain daily, and rather from habit than on account of pain ; and at the end of three weeks there had been no return of this last. The aneurism, meanwhile, has diminished in size and pulsa- tion. Dr. H. having sawed the bone lengthwise, there is seen to be a very marked interstitial atrophy; the parietes being very thin, and the cavity closed by a light cancel- lated structure. The fracture has united regularly, though not exactly in line. 1870. Dr. J. Romans. 3680. Ossified crystalline lens. The patient, a girl, eighteen years old, was hit in the eye, with a stick, four years ago. For the first two years there was much pain, with failure of vision ; and, at the end of that time she had lost all perception of light. The pain, however, then subsided, and she had not much after- wards, until a short time previous to the operation. For a year past the lens had been opaque, and seemed to be in the anterior chamber ; with occasional inflammation of the eye. When seen at the City Hospital, on the 25th of March, by Dr. W., the cornea was somewhat cloudy, and the size and tension of the globe a little diminished; iris atro- phied ; lens in the anterior chamber, and evidently hardened749 APPENDIX. and shrunken. Immediate removal advised, to obviate danger to the other eye from sympathetic inflammation, in case it should become displaced, and irritate the ciliary nerves. After section "of the lower part of the cornea, an attempt was made to grasp the lens ; but it slipped into the poste- rior chamber, and disappeared in the softened vitreous humor, rendering it necessary to search for it with a curette. Upon removal, it was found completely cretaceous, and diminished in size about one-third. After the operation the incision in the cornea closed at once, and without any increased opacity ; the globe retained its size, notwithstanding a discharge of some of the vit- reous humor, and the girl went home in a few days. The contrast between this cretaceous transformation, to which the lens is liable, and a true bony growth that may form in the bottom of the globe, as shown in No. 2046, is very striking. 1870. Dr. H. W. Williams. THE FOLLOfVING CASE TFAS ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED: — 3681. Deep and extensive excavation in the tibia. The patient was a feeble man, sixty years of age, and entered the hospital Dec. 2d, 1866 (127, 222). When a boy, and without known cause, there came on a swelling over both tibiae, followed by abscesses, and there had been a discharge ever since, with an occasional discharge of small pieces of bone. For the last five years he had done no work, as his health failed. One year before admission the skin over the right leg became red and tense ; an ulcer soon formed, and in a few months there sprang up from its surface an exuberant and rapidly increasing growth. When seen, it had a spongy and vascular look, and was elevated 1^ in. — overlapping the base, and measuring in extent 6 by 3 in. The limb was amputated by Dr. H. below the knee Dec. 8th ; and the patient, sinking from inflammation of the stump, and increased trouble in the other leg, died Jan. 10th. The outgrowth, which was not regarded as malignant,750 APPENDIX. and showed no such appearances microscopically, was easily torn from its attachments, and left a rather defined cavity in the upper, anterior part of the bone, 5 in. in length, and involving almost its whole width and depth. The affected surface is rough, but the structure is generally sufficiently compact; and, otherwise, the bone is but little affected. 1867. Dr. R. M. Hodges.INDEX. Abscess.

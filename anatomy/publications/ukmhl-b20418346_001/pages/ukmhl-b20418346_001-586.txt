344 COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. Fig. 255. Fig. 255.—Dissection of the Right Side of the Neck to show the Muscular Triangles, the Carotid and Subclavian Arteries, &c. (from R. Quain). £ a, angle of the jaw and masseter muscle; b, parotid gland ; +, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle ; c, submaxillary gland ; d, upon the mylohyoid muscle below the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, and above the front of the hyoid bone ; e, upper belly of the omohyoid muscle; e', lower belly ; /, sterno-hyoid muscle ; g, sterno- thyroid; 1, upon the sterno-mastoid muscle, points by a line to the upper part of the common carotid artery ; 2, upon the scalenus anticus muscle, points to the third part of subclavian artery ; 3, upon the scalenus medius, points to the superficial transverse cervical artery crossing the axillary nerves ; 4, points to the posterior scapular artery, passing under the levator scapulae muscle ; 5, placed upon the clavicle, points to the supra- scapular artery ; 6, external carotid artery ; 6', internal carotid aitery ; 7, upon the thyro- hyoid muscle, points to the superior thyroid artery giving superiorly its hyoid branch ; 8, is placed upon the hyo-glossus muscle within the arch of the lingual artery; 9, placed on the stylo-hyoid muscle, indicates the facial artery ; 10, origin of the occipital artery, from the root of which the small sterno-mastoid artery is given off; between the occipital and the facial arteries, +, upon the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, points to the continuation of the external carotid artery before entering the parotid gland. The absence of branches from the trunk of the common carotid is connected with

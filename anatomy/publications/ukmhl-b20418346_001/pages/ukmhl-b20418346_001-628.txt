386 BRACHIAL ARTERY. Fig. 271. In all cases of the high origin of one or other of the arteries of the fore-arm the extent in which the two vessels thus formed run separately must vary according to the height at which the main artery divides. The point of division in the entire number of cases, without reference to the particular branch given off, is most frequently in the upper, less so in the lower, and least so in the middle third of the arm. But the early division of the main artery of the upper limb may, as mentioned in connection with the varieties of the axillary artery, take place within the axilla, in which case it follows that the brachial portion of the vessel is replaced, throughout its whole extent, by two separate trunks. In 94 cases out of 481 observed by R. Quain, or about one in five and one-ninth, there were two arteries instead of one in some part or in the whole of the arm. The position of the two arteries, in these cases, is of much surgical interest. We shall here con- sider only their position in the arm, and subse- quently trace them in their irregular course in the fore-arm. Usually they are close together, and occupy the ordinary position of the brachial artery ; but there are some peculiarities in their position which require to be particularly noticed. The radial artery, when thus given off in the arm, often arises from the inner side of the brachial, then runs parallel with the larger vessel (the bra- chial or ulnar-interosseous), and crosses over it, sometimes suddenly, opposite the bend of the elbow, still covered by the fascia. It has been found, but in a very few instances only, to perforate the fascia, and run immediately under the skin, near the bend of the elbow.

When the ulnar is the branch given off high from the brachial, it often inclines from the posi- tion of the brachial, at the lower part of the arm, towards the inner condyle of the humerus. This vessel generally lies beneath the fascia as it descends, and superficially to the flexor muscles.

THE HEART. 306 and are retained in position within the ventricle by the chordae tendineas, which are attached to their ventricular surfaces and free margins. Fig. 230.â€”Views of parts op the Semilunar and Mitral Valves, as seen prom within the Ventricle. A, portion of the pulmonary artery and wall of the right ven- tricle with one entire segment and two half segments of the semi- lunar valves ; a, half the sinus of Valsalva of the anterior segment; b, the same of the left posterior seg- ment ; c, the entire right posterior segment (see Fig. 231, A, in which the lettering is the same as in the present figure) ; d, d', inner sur- face of the ventricle; 1, the attachment of the extremities of the segments to the inner wall of the artery ; 2, the middle of the attached border of the segments ; 3, the middle of the free border marked in two of the segments ; upon the middle segment especially the direction of the bands of fibres strengthening the valve, as repre- sented by Pettigrew, is shown. B, portion of the aorta and wall of the left ventricle with one entire segment and two half segments of the semilunar valve, and the right or anterior segment of the mitral valve; a, half the right anterior sinus of Valsalva and segment (marked b in B, fig. 231) ; b, the same of the left side ; c, the posterior sinus of Valsalva and segment entire; in a, and b, the apertures of the coronary arteries are seen ; d, d', the inner surface of the wall of the ventricle to the right of the auriculo-ventricular orifice; 1, 1, the attachments of the extremities of the segments ; 2, the middle of the attached borders; 3, the middle of the free border with the corpus Arantii shown in the middle segment; e, e\ the base of the right or anterior seg- ment of the mitral valve; /, its apex; between e, and ef, and /, the attachment of the branched chordaa tendineas to the margin and outer surface of the valve segment; g, the posterior principal niusculus papillaris ; h, the anterior principal musculus papillaris : the cat chordae tendineas are those which belong to the left or pos- terior segment and the small or intermediate segments. During the contraction of the ventricles, the segments of the valves are applied to the openings leading from the auricles, and prevent the blood from rushing back into those cavities. Being retained by the chordse tendinese, the expanded flaps of the valve resist the pressure of the blood, which

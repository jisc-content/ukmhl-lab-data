FLEXOR MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 195 This muscle is placed deeply : in its lower part it is crossed by the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, and in its whole length it is traversed by the phrenic nerve passing obliquely from above downwards and inwards. The subclavian vein and artery pass respectively in front and behind its inferior attachment. The nerves of the brachial plexus emerge from behind its outer border above the subclavian artery. The rectus capitis anticus major arises on its inner side, the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery lies in the groove between that muscle and the scalenus, and in front is the internal jugular vein. The scalenus medius is attached superiorly to the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the last six cervical vertebrse ; and inferiorly to a rough elevation on the first rib, extending for an inch and a half forwards from the tubercle. In front of this muscle, between it and the anterior scalenus, are the cervical nerves and the subclavian artery; behind it are the posterior scalenus and levator anguli scapulae muscles. It is sometimes attached to the transverse process of the atlas. The scalenus posticus, smaller than the other scaleni muscles, is attached above by two or three small tendons to the transverse processes of as many of the lowest cervical vertebra?, and inferiorly by an aponeu- rotic tendon to the second rib, in front of the attachment of the levator costse.

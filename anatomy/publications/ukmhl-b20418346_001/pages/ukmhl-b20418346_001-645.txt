403 INTERCOSTAL ARTERIES. is separated from the pleura by a fascia ouly, but further outwards it lies between the two layers of intercostal muscles. Extending forwards in con- Fig. 281.â€”View of the Thoracic and Upper Part op the Abdomi- nal Aorta, &c. \ For the general descrip- tion of this figure, see p. 334. The following numbers in- dicate the branches of the aorta; 1, placed between the origins of the right and left coronary arteries; 2, innominate ; 3, left carotid; 4, left subclavian; 5, bron- chial; 6, 6, oesophageal; 7, 7, intercostal arteries (sixth and seventh); 8, inferior phrenic; 9, coeliac axis; 10, below the superior mesen- teric and opposite the origin of the renal arteries ; 11, 11, two of the lumbar arteries. tact with the rib above, it finally anastomoses with one of the anterior intercostal branches de- rived from the inter- nal mammary artery, and with the thoracic branches of the axillary artery. The first of the aortic intercostal arteries has an anastomosis with the superior intercostal pro- ceeding from the sub- clavian artery; and the last three are prolonged into the abdominal mus- cles, where they com- municate with the epi- gastric artery in front, with the phrenic arteries at the side, and with the lumbar branches of the abdominal aorta lower down. Each intercostal ar- tery is accompanied, as it runs outwards be- tween the ribs, by a corresponding vein, and by one of the dorsal nerves ; the vein usually being uppermost, and the artery next below it.

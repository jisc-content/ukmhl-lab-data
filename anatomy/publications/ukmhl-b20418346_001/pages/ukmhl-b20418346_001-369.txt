ARTICULATIONS OF THE ATLAS AND AXIS. 127 Fig. 115.—Transverse Section similar to that represented in flg. 113, with a smaller portion of the occipital bone, the Crucial Ligaments being removed. 4, alar or odontoid ligament; 5, accessory atlanto-axial ligament ; 6, 7, capsular liga- ments of the occipito-atlantal and the atlanto- axial articulations ; 9, placed on the head of the odontoid process ; 9, 9', superior or median occipito-odontoid ligament. The ligamentum suspensorium dentis or middle odontoid ligament consists of fibres which pass directly upwards from the summit of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magnum. Fig. 115. Fig. 116. B Fig. 116.—The Ligamentous Structures which surround the Articulations of the Occiput and two Upper Vertebrae. £ A, the lower part of the skull sawn transversely through the basilar process, with the atlas and axis, viewed from before. 1, the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament; 2, the middle thickened part or accessory occipito-atlantal ligament; 3, the anterior atlanto- axial ligament. B, the lower part of the skull, with three adjacent vertebra?, viewed from behind. 1, the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament; 2, the posterior atlanto-axial ligament. C, the occipital bone sawn transversely through the foramen magnum, and a part of the arches of the atlas and axis removed posteriorly, so as to show the thickened prolonga- tion of the posterior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebras with the apparatus ligamentosus.

355 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. between the jaw and the internal lateral ligament of the temporo-maxillary joint, then passes obliquely forwards and upwards on the outer surface of the external pterygoid muscle (not unfrequently beneath and within it), and opposite the interval between the two heads of that muscle, bends inwards to the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it ends by division into a number of branches. To facilitate the arrangement of its numerous branches, this artery may be considered in three parts, viz. : 1, the part between the jaw and internal lateral ligament ; 2, the part in contact with the external pterygoid muscle ; and, 3, the part in the spheno-maxillary fossa.

Fig. 258.â€”Deep Dissection op the Head and Face, to show the Internal Maxillary Artery and its Branches (from Tiedemann). | The right half of the calvarium, the zygomatic arch, and the upper part of the lower jaw have been removed ; the external pterygoid muscle and some of the superficial muscles of the face have been divided, and the internal pterygoid and buccinator muscles are exposed: ], facial artery, rising over the edge of the lower jaw; 2, inferior labial branches ; 2', deep mental branch of the inferior maxillai-y artery; 3, facial artery con- tinued ; 4, superior coronary of the facial ; 5, lateral nasal brauch ; 6, frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery, giving descending twigs to communicate with the angular branch of the facial and with the dorsal nasal; 7, internal carotid artery; 8, external carotid artery at the place where it passes through the parotid gland, which has been removed; 9, division of the external carotid artery into superficial, temporal, and internal maxillary arteries; 10, superficial temporal; 11, masseteric branch of the external carotid artery ; 12, superiorly the trunk of the internal maxillary or deep facial artery, and inferiorly its inferior maxillary branch ; 13, placed on the zygoma, points to the middle meningeal branch, and above on the dura mater to its distribution ; 14, placed on the lower part of the temporal muscle separated from the coronoid process of the jaw, indicates the deep temporal branches of the artery; 15, pterygoid branches ; 16, buccal artery ; 17, posterior superior dental, and deepest part of the internal maxillary artery where it enters the spheno-maxillary fossa ; 18, branches of the infra-orbital artery issuing upon the face.-

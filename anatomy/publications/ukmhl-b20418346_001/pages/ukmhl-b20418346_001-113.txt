The animal basis is here, however, of a totally different nature from that of the bone crusta petrosa which is contiguous to the dentine or to the enamel, is marked over with spheroidal bodies having, in decalcified specimens, very much the appearance represented in Fig. XLVIII., but most of them with one or more lacuna-like cavities within. They look very like distinct globules, and have been described by Czermak as calcified cells containing lacunse; but on carefully viewing the decalcified layer in profile-sections and otherwise, I am led to the conclusion that they are mammillary elevations of the surface, continuous by their (sometimes contracted) bases with the general substance. The enamel is destroyed in the decalcification, but the surface of the dentine of the cervix and root from which the mammillated layer of crusta petrosa has been detached, is found to be excavated in a manner to correspond with it; an arrangement well calculated to secure their mutual connection. 9 2

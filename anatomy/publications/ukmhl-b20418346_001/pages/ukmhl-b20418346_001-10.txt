vi ADVERTISEMENT. illustrative of the objects, and many additional figures have been introduced. The duty of selecting these figures and superintending their execution has been performed by Dr. Thomson. All those of the bones, and most of those of the joints have been drawn from the natural objects. Many of the figures of the muscles were also drawn from nature, and most of the others, though founded on approved published prints, have been modified and finished from actual dissections. When figures are not original, the sources whence they have been taken are faithfully indicated. Of those borrowed from the works of Kolliker, Sappey, and Frey, a certain number are impressions from electro-type copies, obtained through the courtesy of the authors and publishers of these works. The new cuts have been executed chiefly by Messrs. Kobert Tennant and Stephen Miller, of Glasgow ; the former as draughtsman, the latter as engraver. Several of those new to the General Anatomy are by Mr. W. H. Wesley, of London. The Section on Surgical Anatomy has been reprinted as ori- ginally written by Professor R. Quain, with only a few verbal alterations. Instead of the paragraphs headed " dissection," distributed through the work in former editions, it has been thought preferable to supply a systematic but concise set of directions for dissection at the end of the book. Whilst it is hoped that this chapter will add to the utility of the work, it is by no means intended that it should supersede the use of special Manuals of Practical Anatomy.

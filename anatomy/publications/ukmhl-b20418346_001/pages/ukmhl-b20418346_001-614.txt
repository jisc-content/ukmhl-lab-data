SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 372 muscle ; it then crosses the subclavian artery, and continues transversely outwards behind and parallel with the clavicle and subclavius muscle, and below the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle. Approaching the upper margin of the scapula, under cover of the trapezius muscle, it inclines Fig. 264.

BRACHIAL ARTERY. cover of the triceps, and perforating the external intermuscular septum, reaches the external and anterior aspect of the bone. There the artery lies deeply in the interval between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus muscles, considerably diminished in size by having given off several branches, and descends to the elbow, where it anastomoses with the recurrent branch of the radial artery.

The superior profunda gives off branches in its first part to the deltoid, coraco-brachialis, and triceps; and many to the last-named mus- cle, whilst it is between it and the bone. In this position it also gives one long branch, which descends perpendicularly between the muscle and the bone to the back part of the elbow-joint on the outer side, where it anasto- moses with the interosseous recurrent branch ; and another which anastomoses on the inner side with the ulnar recurrent and the anasto- motic or the inferior profunda. (b) The inferior profunda artery (col- laterals ulnaris prima), of small size, arises from the brachial artery a little below the middle of the arm, and is

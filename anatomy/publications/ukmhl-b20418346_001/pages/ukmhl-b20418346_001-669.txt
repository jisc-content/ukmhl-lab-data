427 BRANCHES OF THE PUDIC ARTERY. superficial fascia, between the erector penis and accelerator urinae muscles, supplying both. In this course the artery gradually becomes superficial, and is finally distri- buted to the skin of the scrotum and the dartos. It not unfrequently gives off the following branch. Fig. 293.

(c) The transverse perineal artery, a very small vessel, arises either from the pudic artery, or from the superficial perineal, near the transversus perinsei muscle. It lies across the perinaeum, and terminates in small branches which are distributed to the transverse muscle, and to the parts between the anus and the bulb of the urethra. (d) The artery of the bulb, is, surgically considered, an important vessel. It is very f f 2

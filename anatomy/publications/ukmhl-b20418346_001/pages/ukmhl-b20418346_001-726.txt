DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEINS. 484 the heart. Each is formed by the union of a superior and an inferior vein, named the primitive jugular and the cardinal. The primitive jugular vein receives the blood from the cranial cavity by channels in front of the ear, which are subsequently obliterated; in the greater part of its extent it becomes the external jugular vein ; and near its lower end it receives small branches, which grow to be the internal jugular and subclavian veins. The cardinal veins are the primitive vessels which return the blood from the Wolffian bodies, the vertebral column, and the parietes of the trunk. The inferior vena cava is a vessel of later development, which opens into the trunk of the umbilical and omphalo-mesenteric veins, above the venae hepaticEe revehentes. The iliac veins, which unite to form the inferior vena cava, communicate with the cardinal veins. The inferior exti-emities of the cardinal veins are persistent as the internal iliac veins. Above the iliac veins the Fig, 32P. A x c Fig. 329. â€” Diagrams illustrating THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UREAT Veins (after Kblliker).

In C, li, in dotted lines, the trans- verse branch of communication between the jugular veins which forms the left innominate vein ; ri, the right innomi- nate vein ; ca', the remains of the left cardinal vein by which the superior intercostal veins fall into the left in- nominate vein ; above p, the obliquely crossing vein by which the hemiazygos joins the azygos vein. cardinal veins are obliterated in a considerable part of their course ; their upper por- tions then become continuous with two new vessels, the posterior vertebral veins of Eathke, which receive the lumbar and intercostal twigs. As development proceeds, the direction of the ducts of Cuvier is altered by the descent of the heart from the cervical into the thoracic region, and becomes con- tinuous with that of the primitive jugular veins. A communicating branch makes its appearance, directed transversely from the junction of the left subclavian and jugular veins, downwards, and across the middle line to the right jugular; and further down

RADIAL ARTERY. D D 2 turns round the outer border of the wrist ; and descends to the back of the space be- ^ tween the metacarpal bones of the thumb and forefinger : there it passes forwards into the palm of the hand, and crosses to- wards the inner side, so as to form the deeper palmar arch. In consequence of the changes in its course, the direction and connections of the radial artery may be separately described in the forearm, on the wrist, and in the hand. Fig. 277.â€”Deep Anterior View of the Ar- teries op the Arm, Forearm, and Hand (from Tiedemann). ^ The biceps brachii, the pronator teres and mus- cles rising from the inner condyle, the supinator longus, the lower part of the flexor longus pol- licis and flexor profundus digitorum, the anterior annular ligament of the carpus and the muscles of the ball of the thumb have been removed ; n, pronator quadratus muscle ; 1, lower part of the axillary artery continued into the brachial; 2, superior profunda branch; 3, inferior pro- funda; 4, anastomotic; 5, upper part of the radial artery and radial recurrent; 5', lower part of the radial artery giving off the superficialis voire branch ; 5", the radial artery emerging from be- tween the heads of the abductor indicis muscle ; 6, 6, the upper part of the ulnar artery with the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent branches ; 6', the ulnar artery approaching the wrist and descending into the superficial palmar arch which has been cut short; 6", the deep branch of the ulnar artery uniting with the deep palmar arch ; 7 (marked only on one), three interosseous branches from the deep palmar arch joining the palmar digital arteries 8, 8, 8, which have been cut away from their origin from the superficial arch to near their division into the collateral digital arteries; the ulnar collateral of the little finger is represented as rising in this instance from the deep ulnar ar- tery ; 9, placed between the princeps pollicis and radialis indicis branches of the radial artery ; 10, lower part of the anterior interosseous artery passing behind the pronator quadratus muscle; 11, anastomosis of the anterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries with recurrent branches from the deep palmar arch. In the forearm the radial artery, com- mencing at the point of bifurcation of the brachial opposite the neck of the radius, descends at first somewhat obliquely out- wards in a line with the brachial artery, and then nearly vertically along the outer part of the front of the forearm to the styloid process of the radius. Its course may be indicated by a line drawn from

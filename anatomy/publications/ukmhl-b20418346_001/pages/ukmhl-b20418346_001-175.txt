clxi SYMPATHETIC NERVE. altogether of the grey kind, consisting of gelatinous fibres, with, as usual, a very few- white or tubular fibres mixed with them ; and this observation has since been con- firmed by Beck. The other cord either is entirely white, or more commonly, as appears to me, is made up of a white and grey portion running alongside each other. It seems highly probable that the white cords and the white fasciculi of the mixed cords contain the cerebro-spinal fibres which the spinal nerves contribute to the sympa- thetic, and that the grey cords and fasciculi are contributions from the sympathetic to the spinal nerves. In corroboration of this view, Mr. Beck observes that the grey cords on leaving the ganglia give small branches to the neighbouring vessels, and are reduced in size before joining the spinal nerves. Another interesting fact respecting these communications has been pointed out by the last-named observer somewhat similar to that previously noticed in the frog, namely, that whilst the grey and white connecting cords are in the thorax of nearly equal size, the grey one relatively increases lower down, and in the pelvis constitutes the sole communication between the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic and the spinal nerves, the white branches from the latter to the sympathetic passing over the sacral ganglia without joining them, to enter the sympathetic plexuses sent to the pelvic viscera. The tubular fibres of each white communicating fasciculus can be traced back to both the anterior and the posterior root of the spinal nerve, and pale fibres from the grey fasciculus may be traced up into the anterior root, and as far as the ganglion of the posterior root, which root has also pale fibres above the ganglion. Whether these central pale fibres proceed from the sympathetic to the spinal cord (possibly to be dis- tributed to its vessels), or are sent from the cord and spinal ganglia to the sympathetic, or pass both ways, is as yet uncertain. As to the further progress of the cerebro-spinal fibres conveyed to the sympathetic by the communicating branches, Valentin has endeavoured to show that after joining the main gangliated cord or trunk of the sympathetic, they all take a downward direction, and after running through two or more of the ganglia, pass off in the branches of distribution, leaving the trunk considerably lower down than the point where they joined it. He conceives that this arrangement, which he calls " lex progres^us," is proved by experiments on animals, in which he found, that on irritating different parts of the cerebro-spinal axis, as well as different branches of nerves, the visceral movements which followed bore a relation to the point irritated, which corresponded with the notion of such an arrangement. Volkmann and Bidder, on the other hand, show that this opinion cannot be reconciled with the observed anatomical disposition of the fibres, for there are fasciculi from the communicating branches which obviously pass upwards; nor will the experimental evidence in its favour apply to the upper part of the sympathetic, where, as Valentin himself admits, motorial fibres must be supposed to run in an upwrard direction to account for the contraction of the pupil which follows section of the cervical part of the sympathetic. From what has been stated it seems reasonable to conclude that nerve- fibres take their rise in the ganglia both of the cerebro-spinal and sympa- thetic nerves, and are in both kinds of nerves mixed with fibres of cerebral or spinal origin ; that the ganglia are nervous centres which may probably receive through afferent fibres impressions of which we are unconscious and reflect these impressional stimuli upon efferent or motor fibres : that per- haps, even, certain motorial stimuli emanate from them, the movements ex- cited by or through, the ganglia being always involuntary, and affecting chiefly the muscular parts of the viscera, the sanguiferous, and perhaps the absorbent vessels ; and that, in fine, the chief purpose served in the animal economy by the ganglia and the ganglionic nerve-fibres, whether existing in acknowledged branches of the sympathetic, or contained in other nerves, is to govern the involuntary, and, for the most part, imperceptible movements of nutrition, in so far at least as these movements are not dependent on the brain and spinal cord ; for it must not be forgotten that there is unques- tionable evidence to prove that the visceral and vascular motions are influ- enced by nerve-fibres connected with the cerebro-spinal centre.

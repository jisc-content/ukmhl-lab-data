MUSCULAR TISSUE. cxxii connection differs when the muscular fibres are continuous in a direct line with those of the tendon from that which is observed when the former join the latter at a more or less acute angle. In the first case, the two are directly continuous, the muscular fibre being distinguishable from that of the fibrous tissue by its striation alone. In the second case, the muscular fibres terminate in conical processes, which are received in corresponding Fig. LXVI.—Frog's Muscular Fibre, showing Interstitial Granules, magnified 350 diam.

(from Kolliker). depressions of the tendinous structure, to which they cling ; the connective tissue of the one being continuous with that of the other. Weismann, who adopts this view on later observations of his own, states that the sarco- lemma surrounds the ends of the fibres, which are not continuous with but rather, as it were, cemented to the tendon. Mr. Ellis, on the other hand, describes the connection of striated muscle with tendon as taking place in all cases in the following manner. When a muscular fibre is about to end in a tendon, its component fibrils are collected into bundles of different lengths and sizes like the roots of a tree. Around each bundle tendinous tissue is collected, forming a sheath which appears gradually to cease as it is continued backwards on the undivided fibre. The muscular fibrils of a bundle in approaching the tendon gradually cease, each having probably its own tendinous thread to fix it. The central bundles of fibrils reach further than the circumferential, and thus when the latter are broken off by attempts made to detach a fibre from its neighbours, the fibre appears to have a pointed ending. In this case also Weismann maintains that the sarcolemma intervenes between the muscular substance and the tendon. Fig. LXVI. Fig. LXVIL

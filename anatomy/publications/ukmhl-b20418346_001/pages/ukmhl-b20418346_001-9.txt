ADVERTISEMENT. The successive Editions of Dr. Jones Quain's " Elements of Anatomy " were, up to the fourth inclusive, published under the superintendence of the Author. The duty of editing the fifth edition was undertaken by Mr. Richard Quain, then Professor of Anatomy in University College, and Dr. Sharpey ; the several parts being apportioned between them, as follows, viz. :â€”The General Anatomy to Dr. Sharpey, with the Descriptive Anatomy of the Brain, the Heart, and of the Organs of Respiration, Yoice, Digestion, Urine, and Generation ; and to Mr. Quain the remaining portion of the Descriptive Anatomy, comprehending the Bones, Muscles, Articulations, Fasciae, Vessels, Nerves, and the Organs of the Senses, together with the Surgical Anatomy of the different regions. On that occasion extensive changes were made through- out the work, and a great part was entirely re-written. The increasing claims of professional duty having prevented Mr. Quain from continuing his services in preparing the Sixth Edition, his place was taken by Mr. Ellis, his successor in the Chair of Anatomy at University College, who was accordingly associated with Dr. Sharpey, and edited that portion of the work which had previously fallen to the share of his predecessor. In the present edition the General Anatomy, entirely re-written by Dr. Sharpey for the fifth edition, has been again revised by him, and has undergone extensive changes, adapting it to the present state of the science. The whole of the Descriptive Anatomy has been edited by Dr. Thomson and Dr. Cleland.

New figures have in most cases been substituted for those of former editions, drawn on a larger scale, or deemed otherwise more

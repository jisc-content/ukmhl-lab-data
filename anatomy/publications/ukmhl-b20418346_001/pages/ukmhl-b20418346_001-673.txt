EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY 431 EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. The external of the two arteries resulting from the division of the common iliac forms a large continuous trunk, which extends downwards in the limb as far as the lower border of the popliteus muscle, but, for convenience of description, it is named in successive parts of its course external iliac, femoral, and popliteal. The external iliac artery, larger than the internal iliac artery, is placed within the abdomen, and extends from the division of the common iliac to the lower border of Poupart's ligament, where the vessel enters the thigh, and is named femoral. Descending obliquely outwards, its course through the abdominal cavity may be marked by a line drawn from the left side of the umbilicus to a point midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. This line would also indicate the direction of the common iliac artery, from which the external iliac is directly continued. The vessel is covered by the peritoneum and intestines. It lies along the upper margin of the true pelvis, resting upon the inner border of the psoas muscle. The artery, however, is separated from the muscle by the fascia Fig 295.

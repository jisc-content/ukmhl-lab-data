D, compound tubular gland. connective tissue and vessels, forms one of the next size, which, too, has its larger branch of the duct, formed by the junction of the ramuli be- longing to the ultimate lobules. In this way, the whole gland is succes- sively made up, the number of its lobules and of the branches of its duct depending on its size ; for whilst some glands of this kind, like the parotid and pancreas, consist of innumerable lobules, connected by a large and many-branched duct, others, such as the duodenal glands of Brunner and many mucous glauds, are formed of but two or three ultimate lobules, or

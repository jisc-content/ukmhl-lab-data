ULNAR ARTERY. may give origin to the posterior circumflex artery, and that its own origin is sometimes transferred to a branch arising from the axillary artery. The inferior profunda is likewise occasionally absent, and on that account has not been recog- nised by some anatomists as a regular branch of the brachial artery. The anastomotic artery is sometimes much reduced in size, and in that case the inferior profunda takes its piace behind, the humerus.

ULNAR ARTERY. The ulnar artery, the larger of the two vessels into which the brachial divides, ex- tends along the inner side of the fore-arm into the palm of the hand, where, joining a branch of the radial, opposite the mus- cles of the thumb, it forms the superficial palmar arch. In this course it inclines at first downwards and inwards, describing a slight curve, the convexity of which is directed inwards, and passes under cover of

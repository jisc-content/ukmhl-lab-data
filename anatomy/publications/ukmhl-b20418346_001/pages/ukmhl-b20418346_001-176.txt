clxii NERVOUS SYSTEM. Among various physiologists of consideration, who adopt this view in a more or less modified shape, some have been further of opinion that the fibres of ganglionic origin differ in structure, size, and other physical cha- racters from those which arise in the cerebro-spinal axis. As regards this question, I must confess, that there does not seem to me to be conclusive evidence to show that peculiar anatomical characters are distinctive of the fibres of different origin. It has been already stated that both dark- bordered and pale fibres may be connected with ganglion-cells, and for aught that has been proved to the contrary, all three varieties of fibres spoken of, large tubular, small tubular, and grey, may arise both in the cerebro-spinal axis and in the ganglia ; although it is certainly true that the two latter kiiids largely predominate in the sympathetic, and abound in other nerves, or branches of nerves, which appear to receive large contributions from ganglia. VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. The fibres of nerves are endowed with the property of transmitting im- pressions, or the effect of impressions, from the point stimulated towards their central or their peripheral extremities. One class of fibres conduct towards the nervous centres and are named "afferent," their impressions being " centripetal;" another class of fibres conduct towards their distal extremities, which are distributed in moving parts, and these fibres are named "efferent," whilst their impressions are "centrifugal." Impres- sions propagated centripetally along the nerves to the brain give rise to sen- sations, varying according to the nerve impressed, and the objective cause of the impression ; stimuli transmitted outwardly, on the other hand, are conveyed to muscles, and excite movements. Motorial stimuli thus passing along efferent nervous fibres may emanate from the cerebrum as in volun- tary and emotional movements, or possibly from some other central part, as in the case of certain involuntary motions ; or such stimuli may be applied in the first instance to afferent fibres, by these conducted to the brain or some other central organ, and then "reflected" by the central organ to efferent fibres, along which they are propagated to the muscle or muscles to be moved ; and in this case the intervention of the central organ may give rise to sensation or not, the difference in this respect probably depending on the part of the nervous centre where the reflection takes place. The property of conducting a stimulus or propagating its effects in a deter- minate direction, belongs to the fibres of the nerves, and in all probability also to the fibrous part of the nervous centre, while it is probable that to the cells or corpuscles of the grey matter of the central organs, is assigned the office of receiving impressions conveyed from without, and presenting them to the conscious mind, of mediating between the mind and the efferent fibres in excitation of the latter by mental stimuli (as in voluntary and emotional acts), of transferring to efferent fibres stimuli conducted to the centre by afferent fibres in the production of reflex movements, and, pos- sibly, of originating purely corporeal stimuli in certain involuntary motions. In addition to these endowments, the nerves are concerned in controlling and regulating the molecular changes and chemical actions which occur in nutrition, secretion, and other allied processes. It may no doubt be fairly questioned, whether the effect justly attributable to the nerves in such cases is not produced merely through the influence which they exert over the motions of the minute vessels and contractile tissues concerned ; but the tendency of late observations on the nerves of secreting glands, and the experiments on the luminiferous organ of the fire-fly, referred to in a

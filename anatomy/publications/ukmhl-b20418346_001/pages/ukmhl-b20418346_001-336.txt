94 BONES OF THE LOWER LIMB. formation of which they all take part; and the os pubis and ischium also meet on the inner side of the obturator foramen. Fig. 85.â€”Eight Os Innominatum PROM THE DORSAL ASPECT, 3 1, anterior superior spinous pro- cess ; 2, anterior inferior ditto ; 3, posterior superior; 4, posterior in- ferior spinous process ; 5, crest of the ilium ; 6, surface occupied by the gluteus medius muscle above the superior curved line above 3, is a rough surface to which the gluteus maximus is attached ; 7, surface between the superior and inferior curved lines occupied by the gluteus minimus ; 8, groove above the acetabulum, occupied by the posterior tendon of the rectus femoris ; 9, superior ramus of the pubis and pectineal eminence ; 10, crest and spinous process of the pubis ; 11, place of meeting of the descending or in- ferior ramus of the pubis with the ascending ramus of the ischium 13, tuberosity of the ischium ; 14, cartilaginous surface of the aceta- bulum ; and 15, synovial depres- sion and pit for the round ligament; 16, thyroid, or obturator foramen ; 17, greater, and 18, lesser sciatic notches ; between the acetabulum and the ischial tuberosity is seen the groove occupied by the obtu- rator externus muscle. The ilium constitutes the superior expanded portion of the bone, and forms a part of the wall of the acetabulum by its inferior extremity. Above the acetabulum it is limited anteriorly and posteriorly by margins which diverge at right angles one from the other, and superiorly by an arched thick and extensive border, the crista ilii. The crest is curved like the letter /, the anterior extremity pointing slightly inwards and the posterior out- wards ; its surface is broadest in its anterior and posterior thirds, it is rough for the attachment of muscles, and on it may be distinguished an external and internal lip and an intermediate space. The anterior extremity of the crest forms a projection forwards called the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and, separated from it by a concave border, and placed immediately above the acetabulum, is another eminence called the anterior inferior spine : the projecting posterior extremity of the crest forms the posterior superior spine, and separated from it by a notch is the posterior inferior spine, below which the posterior border of the bone is hollowed out into the great sciatic notch. The external surface, or dorsum of the ilium, concavo-convex from behind forwards, presents, close to the posterior extremity of the crest, a roughness of some extent, to which the gluteus maximus muscle is attached, and is traversed by two rough arched lines, one of which, the superior curved line, beginning in front at the upper border of the bone, about an inch and a half from its anterior extremity, arches backwards to the upper part of the great sciatic notch, while the other, the inferior curved line, shorter

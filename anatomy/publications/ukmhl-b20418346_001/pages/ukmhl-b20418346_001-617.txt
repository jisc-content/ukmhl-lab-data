375 INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. Those placed nearest to the mammary gland supply that organ, and in the female they are of comparatively large size, especially during lactation. Some offsets ramify on the sternum. Fig. 265â€”Dissection of the right side OP THE ANTERIOR THORACIC AND AB- DOMINAL Wall, to sfiow the Anasto- moses op the Internal Mammary, Intercostal, and Epigastric Vessels (slightly altered from Tiedemann). j The pectoral part of the serratus mag- nus, the external and internal ob- lique, and the rectus abdominis muscles, have been removed ; 1, upon the subclavius muscle, points to the first part of the axillary artery above the pectoralis minor muscle, giving rise to the acromio-thoracic artery, -which is cut short ; 2, upon the pectoralis minor, points to the lower part of the axillary artery and vein ; 3, the long thoracic artery ; 4, on the cartilage of the first rib, marks the upper part of the internal mammary artery ; 4', the lower part of the same artery giving its abdominal branch behind the cartilage of the seventh rib; 5, in the fourth intercostal space, marks the anastomosis of the internal mammary and intercostal arteries ; 6, anterior branches of the internal mam- mary artery ramifying over the front of the sternum ; 7, on the transversalis muscle immediately above the internal inguinal aperture, points to the last part of the ex- ternal iliac artery, from which are seen rising, 8, the deep epigastric artery, and 9, the deep circumflex iliac ; 10, the anas- tomosis of the epigastric with the abdomi- nal branch of the internal mammary artery ; 11, the spermatic cord and sper- matic twig of the epigastric artery; 12, the femoral artery giving small twigs to the groin and the superficial pudic vessels ; 13, the femoral vein ; 14, a lymphatic gland closing the femoral ring. (e) The musculophrenic artery, the outer of the two branches into which the internal mammary artery divides, in- clines downwards and outwards behind the cartilages of the false ribs, perforating the attachment of the diaphragm at the eighth or ninth rib, and becoming gra- dually reduced in size as it reaches the last intercostal space. It gives branches backwards into the diaphragm; others, which pass outwards to form the anterior iutercostals of each space, and are dis- posed precisely like those which are derived higher up from the main internal mam- mary ; and some which descend into the abdominal muscles. (/) The abdominal branch or superior epigastric artery of the internal mammary, descending into the wall of the abdomen, lies behind the rectus, between the muscle and its sheath; and afterwards, entering the muscle, terminates in its substance, at

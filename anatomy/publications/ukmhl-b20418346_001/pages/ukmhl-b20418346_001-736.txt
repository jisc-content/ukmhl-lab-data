THE ABSORBENTS. 494 Fig. 335. Fig. 335.â€”Diagrammatic Outline of the Prin- cipal Absorbent Vessels and Ducts. \ a, junction of the right jugular and subclavian veins in the right innominate ; 6, the same on the left side ; 1, the thoracic duct, show- ing a division in its upper part; farther down a se- paration into two vessels enclosing a space between them, and at its lower ex- tremity, 1', the receptaculum chyli ; 2, the principal cer- vical lymphatic vessels with the larger glands near their terminations; 3, 3', the principal axillary lymphatic vessels and glands, joined by those from the shoulder and lower part of the neck; 4, 4', the right and left internal mammary and anterior medi- astinal lymphatic vessels (re- presented as more widely se- parated than natural); on the right side, 4' and 4", mark the junction with the internal mammary of the superior hepatic and anterior superior phrenic lymphatics ; 5, some deeper mediastinal and peri- cardiac lymphatics; 6, 6', deep mediastinal lymphatics passing into the right lym- phatic trunk and thoracic duct; 7, the bronchial and pulmonary ; 8, oesophageal ; 9, posterior diaphragmatic lymphatics; 10, the inter- costal and neighbouring lym- phatics of the posterior tho- racic wall represented chiefly on the left side ; at 10', is shown a small collateral trunk formed by the union of a number of the inter- costal lymphatics; 11, 11, short trunks leading into the lower part of the thoracic duct, which receive some of the principal lymphatic ves- sels from the spleen, stomach, and pancreas, and the lacteal vessels from the intestines ; 12, 12', several main vessels, which collect the principal lymphatic vessels of the right and left lumbar plexus, and carry their contents into the thoracic duct ; 13, 13', right and left renal lymphatics ; 14, 14', right and left spermatic lymphatics ; 15, aortic plexus, which farther down is continuous with the sacral; 16, 16 , right and left lumbar plexus, which receive the principal lymphatics of the pelvis and lower limbs.

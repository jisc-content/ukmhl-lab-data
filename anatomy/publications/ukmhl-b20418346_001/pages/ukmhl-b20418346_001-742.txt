500 THE ABSORBENTS. cranium, descend obliquely in the course of the facial vein, and join the submaxillary glands, from six to ten in number, which are placed beneath the Fig. 338. Fig. 338.â€”Principal Lymphatic Vessels and Glands of the Head and Neck on the Right Side (after Bourgery in part). ^ The inner half of the right clavicle and part ot the sternum have been removed so as to expose the arch of the aorta, and the innominate artery and veins : the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle is removed ; and the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno- thyroid muscles, and a part of the external jugular vein have been divided so as to expose the deeper parts. a, the right innominate vein at the place where it is joined by the principal lymphatic trunk ; a', the left vein ; b, arch of the aorta; c, common carotid artery ; d, thyroid gland crossed by the anterior jugular vein ; e, cut surface of the sternum ; /, outer part of the clavicle ; 1, submaxillary lymphatic vessels ; 1', sublingual ; 2, temporal, facial and parotid ; 3, occipital and posterior auricular ; 4, deep or descending cervical close to the great vessels ; 5, transverse cervical; 6, deep pectoral and axillary ; 7, on the vena cava superior, some of the right mediastinal ; 8, on the innominate artery, some of the deeper cardiac and bronchial; to these last are seen descending some of the lymphatics from the thyroid gland and lower part of the neck. base of the lower maxillary bone ; a few of them in their descent pass through some glands situated on the buccinator muscle. The deep lym- phatics of the /ace, derived from those of the temporal fossa and the cavities of the nose, mouth, and orbit, proceed outwards in the course of the internal maxillary vein ; and, having reached the angle of the jaw, they enter the glands in that neighbourhood.

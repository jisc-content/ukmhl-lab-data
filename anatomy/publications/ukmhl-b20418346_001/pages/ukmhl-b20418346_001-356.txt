BONES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 114 Fig. 106. Fig. 106.â€”Ossification of the Bones of the Foot. A, right foot of a foetus of six months. The metatarsal bones and digital phalanges have each their shafts ossified from their primary centres; the tarsus is wholly cartila- ginous, excepting the os calcis, in which the nucleus of bone has just appeared. B, foot of a foetus of from seven to eight months. The astragalus shows an osseous nucleus. C, from a child at birth ; the cuboid has begun to ossify. D, from a child about a year old, showing a nucleus begun in the external cuneiform. E, from a child in the third year; ossification has reached the internal cuneiform. F, from a child between three and four years old, showing ossification in the middle cuneiform and scaphoid bones, and in the epiphyses of the metatarsal bones and phalanges. Gr, from a person of about the age of puberty. Ossification is nearly complete in the tarsal bones ; an epiphysis has been formed on the tuberosity of the os calcis, and the epiphyses of the metatarsal bones and phalanges are shown separate. 1, nucleus of the os calcis ; 1* in Gr, the epiphysis of the os calcis ; 2, nucleus of the astragalus ; 3, of the cuboid ; 4, of the external cuneiform ; 5, of the internal cuneiform ; 6, of the scaphoid ; 7, of the middle cuneiform ; 8, metatarsal bones ; 8*, distal epiphyses of the four metatarsal bones ; 8', proximal epiphysis of the first ; 9, first range of digital phalanges ; 9*, proximal epiphyses of the four outer of these phalanges ; 9', that of the first phalanx of the great toe ; 10, second range of phalanges ; 10*, the epiphyses of these phalanges; 10', epiphysis of the terminal phalanx of the great toe; 11, four terminal phalanges ; 11*, their epiphyses.

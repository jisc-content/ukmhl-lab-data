272 MUSCLES OF THE LOWER LIMB. The psoas magnus arises from the upper and lower lateral parts of the bodies of the last dorsal and of all the lumbar vertebrae, from the interposed fibro-cartilages, and from the anterior surface and lower margin of the- transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae near their bases. It forms a thick elongated muscle, and is inserted into the small trochanter of the femur by means of a tendon, which is placed at first within the substance of the muscle, and afterwards at its outer side, receiving in this manner the fibres of the iliacus as well as those of the psoas.

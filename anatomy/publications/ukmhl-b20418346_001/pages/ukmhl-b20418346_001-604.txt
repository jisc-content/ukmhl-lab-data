INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 362 pierce the sclerotic within a line or two of the margin of the cornea. All these ciliary arteries anastomose together within the eyeball, their distribution in which will be particularly described with the anatomy of the eyeball. (e) The muscular branches, subject to much variety, usually arranged in an upper and lower set, supply the muscles of the orbit. (/) The ethmoidal branches are two in number, a posterior and an anterior. They pass through the posterior and anterior internal orbital foramina, the latter in company with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve; and both arteries, having furnished branches to the ethmoidal cells, enter the skull, supply the adjacent dura mater, and send branches through the cribriform lamella to the nose. {rj) The two palpebral branches, superior and inferior, arise near the front of the orbit, usually together, but soon diverge, one lying above, the other below the tendon of the orbicularis muscle at the inner angle of the eye; they form arches, one in each lid, and send branches to the caruncula lachrymalis and the lachrymal sac. (h) The nasal branch courses forwards above the tendon of the orbicularis muscle to the root of the nose, where it ramifies, maintaining a free communication with the nasal and the angular branches of the facial artery. (i) The frontal branch runs close to the preceding, but on reaching the margin of the orbit turns upwards on the forehead, where it anastomoses with the supraorbital artery.

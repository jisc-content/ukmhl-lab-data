THE HEART. 322 It was shown by Clendinning that the heart continued to increase in weight up to an advanced period of life, but at a comparatively slower rate subsequently to the age of twenty-nine years. Subjoined is a tabular statement of some of the average results derived from the observations of these authors. CLENDINNING. REID. PEACOCK. Weight in oz. Weight in oz. and drachms. Age in years.

The greatest increase was detected in the substance of the left ventricle and the ventricular septum. (Eeid, in the Lond. and Edin. Monthly Journal of Med. Science, April, 1843; T. B. Peacock, in the same journal, in 1846, and reprinted separately, with additional observations, in 1854 ; Clendinning, in the Medic. Chir. Transact., 1838; Bizot, Mem. de la Soc. Mgdic. d'Observation de Paris, torn. i. p. 262. 1836.) Capacity of the auricles and ventricles.—To determine with precision the absolute and relative capacities of the four cavities of the heart, as they exist during life, is impossible; and their capacity is so much influenced by their different states of distension, and also by the different degrees of contraction of their muscular walls at the moment of death, that no constant numerical relation in this respect can be looked for between them. Hence the most opposite statements prevail, especially with regard to the size of the ventricular cavities. The auricles are generally admitted to be rather less capacious than the ventricles. The right auricle is also said to be larger than the left, in the proportion of 5 to 4. (Cruveilhier.) The capacity of the left ventricle has been stated by different anatomists as variously as at 1^ fluid ounces and 4 oz.; it probably does not exceed 2 oz. The right ventricle is asserted by some to be larger than the left; by others (Lower, Sabatier, Andral) the two are stated to have an equal capacity; Cruveilhier, judging from the effect of injections, has found the left to be the larger of the two. In the ordinary modes of death, the right ventricle is always found more capacious than the left, which is probably owing to its being distended with blood, in consequence of the cessation of the circulation through the lungs : the left ventricle, on the other hand, is found nearly empty, and thus becomes more fully contracted. There are reasons for believing, however, that during life scarcely any difference of capacity exists between the two cavities. Size of the ventricular openings.—The right auriculo-ventricular opening, and the orifice of the pulmonary artery, are both found to be somewhat larger after death than the corresponding openings on the left side of the heart. Their circumference is thus stated by Bouillaud. (Traite des Malad. du Coeur, torn. i. p. 52. Paris, 1835.) Auriculo-ventricular orifices Arterial orifices .... Inches and Lines. Max. 1H ed. Min.

Without denying that there may be a modification or variety of the non-striated muscular fibres not divisible into singly nucleated cells, I neverthe- less think that the existence of such contractile cells must now be admitted as fully established, and that the fibres and bundles of the plain muscular tissue are commonly made up of these cells. The plain muscular tissue is for the most part disposed between the coats of the membranous viscera, as the stomach, intestines, and bladder, in the parietes of the air tubes, excretory duct3 of glands, and the like. It is generally collected into larger and smaller fasciculi, which in many cases cross one another and interlace. The fasciculi are connected at their ends with tendinous tissue, and are thus inserted into the membranous and

RADIAL ARTERY. the middle of the bend of the elbow to the narrow interval between the trapezium bone and the tendons of the extensors of the thumb, which can be readily felt on the outer border of the wrist. Fig. 278.—Arteries op the Outer and Back Part op the Arm and Hand, Superficial View (from Tiedemann). £ a, deltoid muscle ; b, external humeral head of triceps; c, biceps brachii ; d, brachialis anticus ; e, supinator longus; /, extensor carpi radialis longior; g, brevior; h, extensor communis digi- torum and extensor minimi digiti; i, extensor carpi ulnaris; h, anconeus; I, flexor carpi ulnaris; m, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis; n, extensor primi internodii pollicis ; o, tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis; 1, 1, branches of superior profunda artery appearing between the triceps and brachialis anticus, and descending on the outer supracondyloid eminence to anastomose with the branches of the recurrent radial artery; 2, above the posterior annular ligament points to the posterior carpal branch of the interosseous artery ; 3, posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery ; 4, radial artery taking its course between the outer lateral ligament of the wrist-joint and the tendons of the extensor muscles before passing near 5, between the two heads of the abductor indicis : beneath the extensor tendons is seen the posterior carpal arch, giving the third and fourth dorsal interosseous arteries ; 6, the inner dorsal artery of the thumb ; 7, the outer dorsal artery of the index finger, and between 7, and 7', the remaining dorsal digital vessels in the spaces between the heads of the metacarpal bones, near their communications with the palmar digital vessels. The radial artery is nearer to the surface than the ulnar, and is covered only by the common integument and fascia, except where it is overlapped by the fleshy part of the supinator longus, which must be drawn aside in order to bring the vessel into view. At first it is in contact with the tendon of the biceps, and is supported by the fatty tissue contained in the hollow in the front of the elbow, which separates it from the £ short supinator muscle. It then rests in succession on the insertion of the pronator teres, the thin radial origin of the flexor sublimis, the flexor pollicis longus, the pronator quadratus, and the lower end of the radius. It is at this last point that the pulse is usually felt during life. To the inner side of this vessel lie the pronator teres in the upper part of its course, and

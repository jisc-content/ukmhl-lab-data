Fig. LII.—Thin Longitudinal Section of Ossifying Cartilage from the Humerus ©f a Fcbtal Sheep. a, cartilage cells uniformly diffused ; b, cells nearer the boundary of the ossification, collected into piles and inclosed in oblong areolae of the clear matrix ; c, dark lines of ossification extending into the matrix and forming the primary bony areolse. Magnified about 70 diameters. Fig. LIII.—Transverse Section of the Ossifying Cartilage represented in Fig. LII., Made a little above c, along the surface of ossification, and including part of the new bone, magnified 70 diameters. The circular sections of the groups of cells and of the osseous areolas are seen ; and the dark bone extending into the clear intercellular matrix. It thus appears that the bony tissue, as it advances into the cartilage, has at first a sort of alveolar structure, made up of fusiform areolce or short tubular cavities, with thin parietes, which are formed by calcifi-

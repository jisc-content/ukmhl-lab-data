cxxxix NERVE-CELLS. Fig. LXXVIL number of fine fibrils, it has been by some anatomists suggested, by others maintained, that they are really bundles of immeasureably fine filaments ; moreover, it is asserted that the fibrillar structure may be actually observed in pale sympathetic fibres ; but this view, however probable, stands in need of confirmation. Pale fibres are also met with (in the sympathetic nerve especially) which appear as fine simple filaments with fusiform enlargements, often finely granular in substance, and possibly of the nature of nuclei, but placed in the continuity of the fibre, and not merely attached to a sheath. Nerve-cells, sometimes called Nerve-vesicles. —These, as already mentioned, constitute the second kind of structural elements proper to the nervous system. They are found in the grey matter of the cerebro-spinal centre and ganglions, constituting a principal part of the last-mentioned bodies, and thence often named ganglionic corpuscles or ganglion globules; they exist also in some of the nerves of special sense at their peripheral expan- sions, and, here and there, in the course of cer- tain other nerves. The nerve-cells may have a spheroidal, oval, or pyriform shape (fig. lxxvii) ; and such for the most part is their form in the ganglions ; but many, and espe- cially those from the grey matter of the spinal cord and brain, are of an angular or irregular figure, and send out processes, Fig. LXXVII. — Ganglionic Nerve-Cells, magnified (from Valentin), Fig. LXXVIII.

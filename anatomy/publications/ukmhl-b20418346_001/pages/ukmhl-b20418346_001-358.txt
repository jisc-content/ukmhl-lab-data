116 BONES OF THE LIMBS. particularly unhappy, as it is difficult to conceive how any substantial homology, or a resemblance other than fanciful, can be traced by imagining half of a bone to cor- respond with one structure, and the other half with a structure totally different. Equally artificial is the proposition of Vicq D'Azyr to compare the upper limb of one side with the lower limb of the other side of the body. The assumed correspondence of the olecranon and patella, which has led to those theories, is not borne out by a comparison of the development of the two structures. The patella is formed, distinct from the tibia, as a sesamoid bone in a tendon, while the olecranon is mainly derived from the principal centre of ossification of the ulna, and is formed only in part by the superior epiphysis of that bone. In support of the more probable view, that the ulna corresponds with the fibula, it is to be noticed that in the echidna the head of the fibula is prolonged upwards into a process which much more closely corresponds with the olecranon than does the patella. It may also be observed that in certain mammals, such as the bear or other plantigrades, in which there is a power of partial pronation, the radius crosses the forearm obliquely, and its upper end is brought somewhat in front of the ulna; while in the greater number of mammals, in which there is no power of pronation or supination, the radius is placed entirely to the front and internally, and the ulna is thrown to the outside and behind, in the same manner as the fibula is to the outside of and behind the tibia ; and the resemblance between the respective bones in the fore and hind limbs is made the more striking that the radius and tibia are in these animals generally the principal bones, while the ulna and fibula are in many species only partially developed. An examination of the fore limb in a series of animals shows that the articulation of the radius with a separate portion of the humerus external to that with which the ulna articulates is quite exceptional, the most common arrangement being that the ulna forms the posterior and the radius the anterior part of one great sigmoid cavity similar to that formed by the ulna in the human subject. In comparing the humeral with the femoral region it may be well to have regard to the apparent twist inwards which is seen in both femur and humerus, but especially in the latter bone. This appearance of twisting is given to the humerus by the direction of the musculo-spiral groove, and by the obliquity in the direction of all the ridges of the bone. In the femur the twisted appearance is very slight, and is most obvious below and in front of the small trochanter. In the humerus the appearance of twisting is much more marked, and is more especially obvious at the spiral groove. If, while the forearm remains unmoved, the lower end of the humerus were turned outwards a quarter of a circle, so as to undo the twist of the bone, the inner condyle would then overhang the flexor aspect of the forearm, and the outer condyle the extensor aspect, and the flexor and extensor muscles would pass directly downwards from the condyles to their terminations. Assuming this mode of viewing the position of the humerus to be correct, we may proceed to compare the limbs by considering the hand and foot, and also the forearm and leg, as having their flexor surfaces directed towards the mesial plane of the body (the position in which they are developed), while the condyles of the humerus and femur continue to be external and internal in position, and the anterior or flexor surface of the humerus corresponds with the anterior or extensor surface of the femur. From this it follows that one of the propositions maintained by those who regard the tibia and ulna as homologous, viz., that the quadriceps extensor femoris obviously corresponds with the triceps brachialis, must be erroneous, and that the biceps femoris may more justly be viewed as corresponding with the triceps brachialis, while the rectus femoris is homologous with the biceps of the arm, and the vasti and crureus with the brachialis anticus muscle, which in some animals extends up to the neck of the humerus; so also the space between the lips of the linea aspera of the femur (which in most animals is much broader than in man) will correspond with the posterior surface of the humerus below the musculo-spiral groove. The detailed comparison of the bones of the shoulder and pelvis is beset with many difficulties, and it must therefore suffice here to remark that it requires further investigation than has been brought to bear upon it, and simply to state that while the scapula obviously corresponds with the ilium, the clavicle is generally regarded as corresponding with the os pubis, and the coracoid process (or coracoid bone of birds and reptiles) with the ischium. Humphry, indeed, has put forward the idea that the upper and lower limbs ought to be regarded not as lying in series but as facing one another,â€”that is to say, as being related to one another symmetrically,

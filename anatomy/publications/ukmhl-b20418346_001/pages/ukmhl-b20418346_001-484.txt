242^ MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. descend, and each is inserted into the outer surface of the rib belonging to the vertebra below that from which it springs. The levator muscles belonging to the lower ribs present some longer additional fibres which, passing over one rib, are inserted into the next one below ; these fibres are sometimes distinguished as levatores longiores costarum. The levatores costarum lie in series superiorly with the scalenus meclius and pos- ticus, and inferiorly with the external range of lumbar inter-transverse muscles. Fig. 194.

BONES OF THE HEAD. 58 palate bone and the root of the internal pterygoid plate, the pterygo- palatine canal; on the inner wall, the spheno-palatine foramen formed by the palate bone and a small part of the sphenoidal spongy bone, and opening into the nasal cavity ; and inferiorly, the posterior palatine canal, which leads down to the palate between the palatal and superior maxillary bones. Fig. 51.—Basis op the Skull, viewed from below, without the Inferior Maxillary Bone. | 1, palatine plate of the superior maxillary bone— the figure is placed near the mesial suture; 2, palatine plate of the palate bone—the figure is placed below the trans- verse suture between the palate and superior max- illary bones ; 3, the an- terior palatine foramen, showing four smaller foramina within ; 4, is placed outside the pos- terior palatine foramen, inside the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, and in front of the smaller posterior palatine foramina in the pyra- midal process of the palate bone ; 5, inner surface of the external pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone ; 6, is placed within the posterior opening of the nares on the inner surface of the internal pterygoid plate; 7, is upon the upper part of the posterior edge of the vomer; x marks the posterior open- ing of the pterygopala- tine canal, and is placed above or in front of the posterior opening of the Vidian canal in the foramen la- cerum anterius ; 8, spheno-maxillary fissure leading into the orbit ; 9, foramen spinosum ; 10, foramen ovale; 11, is placed on the apex of the petrous bone, be- tween the foramen lacerum anterius and the inferior opening of the carotid canal; 12, is placed in the jugular (or digital) fossa of the temporal bone, and indicates the foramen lacerum posterius ; 13, on the articular eminence of the inner root of the zygoma in front of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone ; 14, meatus auditorius externus ; 15, glenoid cavity in front of the fissure of Glaser ; 16, tympanic plate or posterior part of the glenoid cavity, close to the styloid process, below which is seen the stylo-mastoid foramen ; 17, mastoid process, and to its inside the digastric and occipital grooves ; 18, basilar process of the occipital bone, and in front the mark of the still incomplete union with the body of the sphenoid bone ; 19, condyloid articular process of the occipital bone ; 20, is placed in the foramen magnum, and points to the lower opening of the anterior condyloid foramen ; 21, posterior opening of the posterior condyloid foramen; 22, jugular process of the occipital bone, to its inner side the jugular notch, to its outer and above, the stylo- mastoid foramen ; 23, is placed on one side, in front (above in the figure) of the external occipital protuberance, and the line indicates the upper part of the external occipital spine ; 24, superior curved line of the occipital bone ; 25, inferior curved line ; 26, groove and ridge of insertion of obliquus capitis superior muscle.

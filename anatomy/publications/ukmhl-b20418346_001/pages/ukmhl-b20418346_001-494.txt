252 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. series with those of the lower border of the internal oblique muscle. It presents an external and an internal attachment. The external attachment is to Poupart's ligament near its lower part, and there its fibres are continuous with those of the internal oblique muscle ; the internal attachment, smaller Fig. 199. Fig. 199.—Literal view of the Trunk, giving a deep view op the Serratus Magnus and Trans vers alis Abdo- minis Muscles. £ The serratus magnus is stretched out by the sca- pula being drawn away from the ribs, a, coracoid process of the scapula ; b, glenoid cavity ; c, lower angle ; d, first dorsal ver- tebra ; e, placed on the os pubis, points to the inser- tion of Gimbernat's liga- ment ; I, VI, XII, the first, sixth, and twelfth ribs; L', first lumbar vertebra ; 1, upper portion of the serratus magnus attached to the first and second ribs ; 2, second or middle portion attached to the second and third ribs; 3, lower or fan-shaped portion attached to the ribs from the fourth to the ninth ; 4, the external intercostal muscles; 5, upper costal origins of the transver- salis abdominis ; 6, origins of the muscle from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra by the lumbar aponeurosis ; 6', part rising from the crest of the ilium ; 7, lower portion rising from the upper half of Poupart's ligament, and passing over the internal inguinal aper- ture ; 8, sheath of the rectus muscle opened in its upper part by removing the aponeuroses of the oblique muscles ; 9, the same in its lower part left entire at the place where the tendons pass entirely in front of the rectus muscle; 10, the interspinales muscles of the lumbar vertebrae; 11, gluteus minimus; 12, pyriformis. and less constant, is by means of a tendinous band to the spine and crest of the pubes, close to the insertion of the internal oblique muscle. The superior fibres of the muscle extend between those attachments in a series

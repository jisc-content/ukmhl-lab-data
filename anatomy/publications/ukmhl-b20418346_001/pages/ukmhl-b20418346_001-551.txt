The left and posterior side of the auricle is formed by the septum auricu- Fig. 232.â€”The Right Auricle and Ven- tricle OPENED AND A part op their klgiit and Anterior Walls removed so as to show THEIR INTERIOR. \ 1, the superior vena cava; 2, the inferior vena cava at the place where it passes through the dia- phragm, and below the hepatic veins; 2', the hepatic veins cut short; 3, placed upon the tubercle of Lower within the cavity of the right auricle ; 3', placed in the fossa ovalis, below which is the Eusta- chian valve; 3", is placed close to the aperture ot the great coronary vein and the valve of Thebe- sius ; -f-, +, placed in the auriculo-ventricular groove, where a narrow portion of the adjacent walls of the auricle and ventricle has been pre- served ; 4, 4, the cavity of the right ventricle on the right side of the sep- tum, the upper figure is immediately below the semilunar valves ; 4', large right columna car- nea ; 5, the anterior, 5', the posterior, and 5", the left or septal segment of the tricuspid valve ; 6, placed in the interior of the pulmonary artery, a part of the anterior wall of that vessel having been removed, and a narrow portion of it preserved at its commencement where the semi- lunar valves are attached. The valves are represented as in a half-closed position ; two of the segments are seen fore-shortened, the third sideways ; 7, concavity of the aortic arch close to the cord of the ductus arteriosus; 8, ascending part or sinus of the arch covered at its commencement by the auricular appendix and pulmonary artery ; 9, placed between the innominate and left carotid arteries ; 10, appendix of the left auricle ; 11, 11, the outside of the left ventricle, the lower figure near the apex. latum, a partition which separates it from the left auricle. At the lower part of this septum, and just above the ^orifice of the inferior vena cava, is situated an oval depression named fossa or fovea ovalis, which is the vestige of the foramen ovale of the foetal heart (vestigium foraminis ovalis), and indicates the original place of communication between the two auricles. It is bounded above and at the sides by a prominent border, which is deficient below, the annulus ovalis or isthmus Vieussenii. Continuous with the anterior inferior extremity of the annulus ovalis is a crescentic fold of endocardium, the Eustachian valve, springing from the anterior

III. OBTURATOR ARTERY. The obturator artery is in most instances derived from the internal iliac ; it usually arises from the anterior portion of that vessel, but not unfre- quently from its posterior division. The artery is directed forwards along the inside of the pelvis to reach the groove at the upper part of the thyroid foramen. By this aperture it passes out of the pelvis, and immediately divides into its terminal branches. In its course through the pelvis, the artery is placed between the pelvic fascia and the peritoneum, a little below the obturator nerve. Beneath the pubes it lies with its accompanying vein and nerve in an oblique canal, formed partly by a groove in the bone, and partly by fibrous tissue, after passing through which it divides imme-

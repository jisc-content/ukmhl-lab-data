BONE. cxi intercommunicating by caualiculi, remain in the partially ossified cells. When this hard tissue is decalcified by an acid, the original cells and cartilaginous matrix become apparent. Fig.LVL, A. Fig. LVL, B. Fig. LVI.â€”A AND B REPRESENT Two TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OP GROWING BONE, AS IN Fig. LIII., but much more magnified (about 120 diameters). They show the lateral coalescence of the primary bony areolae and the thickening of the sides of the enlarged cavities by new osseous deposit. The section A is made almost imme- diately below the surface of ossification ; B, is somewhat lower, and shows the cavities still more enlarged and their sides more thickened than in A. The new osseous lining is transparent, and appears light in the figures ; the dark ground within the areolse is owing to opaque debris, which collected there in grinding the sections. It must be further noticed that the letter A within the larger figure marks a place where a bony partition had been accidentally broken away, for the large space was naturally divided into two. As ossification advances towards the ends of the bone, the portion as yet cartilaginous continues to grow at the same time, and increases in every dimension. The part already osseous increases also in circumference ; the medullary canal, of which for some time there is no appearance, begins to be excavated in the interior by absorption, and the sides of the shaft acquire

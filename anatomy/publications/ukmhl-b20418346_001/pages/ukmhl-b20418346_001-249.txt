LUMBAR AND CERVICAL VERTEBRAE. with the ribs. Behind each, at its base, is a small process pointing down- wards, which corresponds with the inferior tubercles of the dorsal transverse processes, and is also called the acces- sory process. The transverse processes Fig- 3. of the fifth lumbar vertebra are shorter and thicker than those above, and are usually slanted a little upwards. Fig. 3.—Third Lumbar Vertebra. 4 A, from above; B, from the right side. 1, the body ; 2, the pedicle and inter- vertebral notch; 3, the lamina; 4, the vertebral ring, somewhat triangular; 5, the spinous process ; 6, transverse process; 7, 7', superior and inferior articulating processes; e, the mammillary tubercle, ap- parently on the superior articulating pro- cess ; /, the accessory tubercle, between the articulating and transverse processes. The articulating processes are thick and strong. Their articular surfaces are placed vertically and curved so as to lie in the arc of a circle. Those of the superior pair, concave, look backwards and inwards ; those of the inferior, convex, look forwards and outwards. The superior pair are fur- ther apart than the inferior, and em- brace the inferior pair of the vertebra above them. From each superior articular process a tubercle projects backwards, which corresponds with the internal tubercles of the dorsal transverse processes, and is also called the mammillary process. The ring is large and triangular, or widely lozenge-shaped.

These indications are placed only on the alternate vertebrae to avoid crowding the figure. CERVICAL VERTEBRJE. The cervical vertebrae are seven in number. The first and second are so peculiar in form that they require a separate description. The following characters belong to the five lower vertebrae :— The body is small, and broader from side to side than from before back-

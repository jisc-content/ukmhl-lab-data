365 RELATIONS OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. Relation to Nerves. —The pneumogastric nerve is anterior to the first part of the left subclavian artery, and parallel with it, the recurrent branch on this side turning round below the arch of the aorta. The phrenic nerve Fig. 262. Fig. 262.—View of the Right Common Carotid and Subclavian Arteries, with THE ORIGIN OP THEIR BRANCHES AND THEIR RELATIONS (from R. Quain). g For the description of the upper part of this figure, see p. 342. The following expla- nation relates to the subclavian artery and its branches : 8, the first part, 8', the third part, of the arch of the subclavian artery ; 8", the subclavian vein, shown by the re- moval of a portion of the clavicle ; 9, is placed on the scalenus anticus muscle in the angle between the transverse cervical and supra-scapular branches of the thyroid axis ; 10, outer part of the supra-scapular artery ; 10', transverse cervical branches passing into the deep surface of the trapezius; 10", the posterior scapular artery, represented as rising directly from the third part of the subclavian artery, and passing through the axillary plexus of nerves and under the levator anguli scapulas ; 11, on the scalenus anticus muscle, points to the inferior thyroid artery, near the place where the ascending muscular artery of the neck is given off ; the phrenic nerve lies on the muscle to the outside ; i, the supra-sternal twig of the supra-scapular artery.

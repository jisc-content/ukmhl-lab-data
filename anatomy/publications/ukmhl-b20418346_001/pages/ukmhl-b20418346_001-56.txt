The following statement (from Lehmann) may be taken as a more correct account of the distribution of the several constituents ; but the proportion assigned of albumen is probably somewhat too low.

Their differences, apart from their functional effects in the living body, come under the heads of colour and com- position. 1. Colour. Arterial blood, as already stated, is scarlet, venous blood dark, or purple. Venous blood assumes the scarlet colour on exposure to air, i. e., to oxygen. This change is greatly promoted by the saline matter of the serum, and may be accelerated by adding salts or sugar to blood, especially by carbonate of potash, or of soda, and by nitre. Salts added to dark blood, without exposure to oxygen or air, cause it to assume a red colour, but not equal in brightness to that of arterial blood. On

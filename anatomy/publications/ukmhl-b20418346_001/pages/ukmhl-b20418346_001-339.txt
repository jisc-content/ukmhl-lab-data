FORM OF THE PELVIS. H 7 THE PELVIS. The ossa innominata with the sacrum and coccyx form the osseous walls of the pelvis. This part of the skeleton may be considered as divided into two parts at the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, the sacral promontory and the ilio-pectineal lines. The circle thus completed constitutes the brim or inlet of the lower or true pelvis ; the space above it, between the iliac fossae, belongs really to the abdomen, but has been called the upper or false pelvis. The inferior circumference, or outlet of the pelvis, presents three bony eminences, the coccyx and the tuberosities of the ischium. Between the tuberosities of the ischium in front is the pubic or sub-pubic arch, which bounds an angular space extending forwards to the symphysis, and is formed by the descending rami of the ossa pubis and the ascending rami of the ischia. The interval between the sacrum and coccyx and the ischium on each side is bridged over in the recent state by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, which therefore assist in bounding the outlet of the pelvis.

Fig. 88. View of the Pelvis of a middle-aged Woman. Â£ Similarly placed with that shown in the preceding figure, and designed to illustrate, by comparison with it, the principal dif- ferences between the male and female pel- vis, viz., the greater distance in the female between the aceta- bula, the wider and shallower true pelvis, the triangular form of the obturator fora- m en, the greater width between the tuberosities of the ischium, and the greater width of the sub-pubic arch. The numbers indicate the same parts as in the preceding figure.

221 COMMON EXTENSOR OF THE FINGERS. 16-1 The extensor carpi radialis brevior arises from the outer condyloid eminence of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the other extensor muscles, from the intervening fibrous septa, from a superficial tendinous expansion, and from the external lateral liga- ment of the elbow-joint. Its muscular belly pjg 132, ends in a flat tendon, which descends with that of the extensor longior, passes through the same groove of the radius with it, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. A bursa is placed between this muscle and the supinator brevis, and a smaller one between the tendon and the metacarpal bone.

This muscle is covered by the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior, and conceals the supinator brevis and the insertion of the pronator radii teres. The tendon of this muscle and that of the extensor carpi radialis longior are crossed obliquely by the extensors of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the thumb. The extensor communis digitorum, placed between the extensor carpi radialis brevior and the extensor minimi digiti, arises by a tendon common to it and the other super- ficial extensor muscles, also from the fascia of the forearm, and the septa between it and the adjoining muscles. Somewhat below the middle of the forearm the muscular part ends in four tendons, which pass between the posterior annular ligament of the wrist and the innermost broad groove on the back of the radius, and diverge as they proceed along the carpus and metacarpus to reach the fingers. Here each is increased by tendinous fibres derived from the lumbricales and interossoous muscles,

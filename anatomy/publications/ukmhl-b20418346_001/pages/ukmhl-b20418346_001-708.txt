VEINS OF THE UPPER LIMB. 466 more numerous in the deep than in the subcutaneous veins. Valves are constantly to be found at the entrance of branches into the main vessels. SUPERFICIAL VEINS OF THE UPPER LIMB. The superficial veins of the upper limb are much larger than the deep ; they lie between the skin and the fascia. At the upper part of the fore Fig. 317.

At the bend of the elbow the median vein divides into an outer and an inner vessel, named respectively median- cephalic and median-basilic, one of which joins with the radial to form the cephalic vein, while the other joins with the ulnar to form the basilic. The two principal cutaneous veins of the forearm, the radial and the ulnar, commence on the dorsal surface of the hand, by a sort of plexus, formed by the convergence of numerous small veins, which proceed from the dorsal surface of the fiugers. The radial cutaneous vein commences by branches upon the dorsal surface of the thumb and fore finger. These ascend over the outer border of the wrist, and form by their union a large vessel, which passes along the radial border of the forearm, receiving numerous branches from the anterior and posterior surfaces. r^m- A At the bend of the arm, in the groove external to the biceps muscle, it unites with the median-cephalic division of the median vein, to form the cephalic vein. The cephalic vein ascends along the outer border of the biceps muscle and in the interval between the great pectoral and deltoid muscles, and finally, dipping in between those muscles, terminates in the axillary vein, between the coracoid process and the clavicle. The ulnar cutaneous veins are two in number, one on the front, the other on the back part of the forearm. The posterior ulnar cutaneous vein, begins on the back of the hand by branches, which unite to form a vein placed over the fourth metacarpal space, and called by some of the older anatomists "vena salvatella." This proceeds along the ulnar border of the forearm on the posterior aspect, and, below the bend of the elbow, turns forwards to join with the anterior ulnar cutaneous vein, which ascends from the anterior surface of the wrist. At the bend of the elbow, the common ulnar cutaneous unites with the median-basilic division of the median to form the basilic vein. The basilic vein, usually of considerable size, ascending along the inner border of the biceps muscle, in front of the brachial artery, passes through

407 CCELIAC ARTERY AND BRANCHES. at 3' as proper hepatic artery to the liver ; 4, superior pyloric artery ; 4', another pyloric branch; 5, placed on the main trunk of the vena porta at the place where the hepatic artery and ductus communis choledochus are in front of it; 5', branches of the vena portse in the transverse fissure ; 6, gastro-duodenal artery ; 6', its continuation as the right gastro-epiploic; 7, on the left crus of the diaphragm, the splenic artery; 8, its left gastro-epiploic branch proceeding round the great curvature of the stomach to com- municate with the right gastro-epiploic artery ; both of these vessels are seen giving long epiploic as well as gastric branches. Fig. 283. 1. The Coronary Artery of the Stomach, the smallest of the three visceral branches derived from the coeliac artery, inclining upwards and to the left side, reaches the cardiac orifice of the stomach, and then proceeding along the smaller curvature of the stomach, from left to right, gives branches to both sides of that viscus and inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. Where it first reaches the stomach, this artery sends upwards oesophageal branches, Avhich anastomose with the aortic oesophageal arteries. The branches to the stomach,

FASCIA OF THE LOWER LIMB. 294 Hunter's canal, which contains the femoral artery and vein, together with the internal saphenous nerve. The aponeurosis of the leg is particularly dense in the upper and fore part, and is strengthened by fibres from the tendons of the biceps externally, and the sartorius, gracilis, and semimembranosus internally. Behind, over the popliteal space, it consists of strong transverse fibres, which bind together the muscles of the outer and inner sides, and is perforated at the lower part of the space by the external saphenous vein; lower down it becomes much thinner over the gastrocnemius muscle. This fascia is adherent to the periosteum covering the head, the spine and the posterior margin of the tibia, the head of the fibula, and the outer and inner malleoli; and it invests the leg completely except at the inner surface of the tibia. From its deep surface intermuscular septa are prolonged inwards. The situation of these septa is marked on the surface of the fascia by several white lines in front and on the outer side of the leg. One, parallel to the spine of the tibia, runs between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum, and is attached deeply to the interosseous membrane ; and another extending Fig. 223.

These septa, as well as the upper and anterior portion of the fascia itself, afford attachment to the muscular fibres, and thus increase greatly the extent of the surfaces from which the muscles derive their origin.

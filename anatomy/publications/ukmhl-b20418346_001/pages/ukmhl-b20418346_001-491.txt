249 EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE, The aponeurosis of the external oblique, wider at the lower than at the upper part, and larger than that of either of the subjacent abdominal muscles, extends inwards towards the middle line in front ; at some distance from this, but farther out above than below, it becomes inseparably united with the aponeurosis beneath, and forms a part of the sheath of the rectus muscle in the whole extent of the space from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. The upper part of the aponeurosis is connected externally with the larger pectoral muscle. Its lower fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend across from the anterior superior iliac spine to the spine of the pubes, in the form of a broad band, which is called the liya- mmt of Fallopius, or more commonly of Poupart. This band is curved at the middle and outer parts, the convexity of the curve being directed towards Fig. 197. Fig. 197.—Superficial View of the Muscles of the Abdomen, from before. £ 14, external oblique muscle ; 15, is placed on the ensiform cartilage at the upper end of the linea aba ; 15', umbilicus; 16, symphysis pubis at the lower end of the linea alba ; above 16, the pyramidales muscles are seen shining through the abdominal aponeurosis ; from 14 to 17, the linea semilunaris ; between this line and the linea alba are seen the transverse lines of the rectus muscle ; above 22, the curved margin of Ponpart's ligament; on either side of 16, the external abdominal ring is indicated.

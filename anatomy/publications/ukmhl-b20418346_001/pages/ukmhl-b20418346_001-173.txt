elix SYMPATHETIC NERVE. which connects together the principal chain of ganglia, and in the primary branches proceeding from thence to the viscera. In the last-mentioned case the different fasciculi get more mixed as they advanse, but generally it is only after the white fasciculi have passed through one or more ganglia that they become thoroughly blended with the grey ; and then, too, the nervous cords receive a large accession of grey fibres (apparently derived from the ganglia), which are mixed up with the rest, and take off more and more from their whiteness. Relation of the sympathetic to the cerebrospinal nerves,â€”We have next shortly to consider the relation between the sympathetic and the cerebro- spinal system of nerves. On this important question two very different opinions have long existed, in one modification or another, amongst ana- tomists. 1. According to one, which is of old date, but which has lately been revived and ably advocated by Valentin, the sympathetic nerve is a mere dependency, offset, or embranchment of the cerebro-spinal system of nerves, containing no fibres but such as centre in the brain and cord, although it is held that these fibres are modified in their motor and sensory properties in passing through the ganglia in their way to and from the viscera and involuntary organs. 2. According to the other view, the sym- pathetic nerve (commonly so called) not only contains fibres derived from the brain and cord, but also proper or intrinsic fibres which take their rise in the ganglia ; and in its communications with the spinal and cranial nerves, not only receives from these nerves cerebro-spinal fibres, but imparts to them a share of its own proper ganglionic fibres, to be incorporated in their branches and distributed peripherally with them. Therefore, accord- ing to this latter view, the sympathetic nerve, commonly so called, though not a mere offset of the cerebro-spinal nerves, yet, receiving as it does a share of their fibres, is not wholly independent, and for a like reason the cerebro-spinal nerves (as commonly understood) cannot be considered as con- stituted independently of the sympathetic ; in short, both the cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic are mixed nerves, that is, the branches of either system consist of two sets of fibres of different and independent origin, one con- nected centrally with the brain and cord, the other with the ganglia. Hence, if we look to the central connection of their fibres as the essential ground of distinction among nerves, the cerebro-spinal system of nerves might, strictly speaking, be considered as consisting of and comprehending all the fibres having their centre in the cerebro-spinal axis, whether these fibres run in the nerves usually denominated cerebral and spinal, or are distributed to the viscera in the branches of the nerve usually named the sympathetic; and, on the same ground, the sympathetic or ganglionic system, strictly and pro- perly so called, would consist of and comprehend all the fibres connected centrally with the ganglia, wherever such fibres exist and into whatever combinations they enter, whether proceeding to the viscera or distributed peripherally with the nerves of the body generally; the nerve-fibres which emanate from the ganglia on the roots of the spinal and cerebral nerves being reckoned into the system, as well as those from ganglia, usually deno- minated sympathetic. While ready, however, to acquiesce in the justice of the above distinction, we do not mean to employ the terms already in use in a sense different from that which is currently received. In endeavouring to decide between the two views above stated, it may be first observed that the existence in the sympathetic nerve of fibres connected centrally with the cerebro-spinal axis, is proved not only by tracing bundles of fibres from the roots of the spinal nerves along the communicating branches and into the sympathetic, but

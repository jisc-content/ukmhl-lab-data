OSSIFICATION OF TIBIA AND FIBULA. 113 Fig. 104. Fig. 104.—Ossification of the Tibia. A, tibia of a foetus some weeks before birth ; the shaft is ossified ; the ends are cartilaginous. B, tibia of a child at birth, showing the commencement of a nucleus in the upper epiphysis. C, tibia of the third year, showing the nucleus of the lower epiphysis. D, tibia of about eighteen or twenty years, showing the united condition of the lower epiphysis, while the upper remains separate. The upper epiphysis is seen to include the anterior tuberosity. E shows an example of a separate centre for the anterior tuberosity. 1, shaft ; 2, superior epiphysis; 2*, separate centre for the anterior tuberosity ; 3, inferior epiphysis. Fig. 105. Fig. 105.—Ossification of the Fibula. A, fibula from a child at birth. The shaft ossified ; the ends cartilaginous. B, fibula from a child of two years, showing a nucleus in the lower epiphysis. C, the bone of a child of about four years, showing the nucleus of the upper epiphysis ; the lower ought to have been shown as more advanced. D, fibula of a person of about twenty years, in which the lower end is complete, but the upper epiphysis is still separate. 1, shaft; 2, lower epiphysis ; 3, upper epiphysis. I

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION" OF THE TEXTURES. v occur in the living body, and seems indeed to be indispensable for the main- tenance and manifestation of life. All the soft tissues contain water, some of them more than four-fifths of their weight; this they lose by drying, and with it their softness and flexibility, and so shrink up into smaller bulk and become hard, brittle, and transparent; but when the dried tissue is placed in contact with water, it greedily imbibes the fluid again, and recovers its former size, weight, and mechanical properties. The imbibed water is no doubt partly contained mechanically in the interstices of the tissue, and retained there by capillary attraction, like water in moist sandstone or other inorganic porous substances ; but the essential part of the process of imbibition by an animal tissue is not to be ascribed to mere porosity, for the fluid is not merely lodged between the fibres or laminae, or in the cavities of the texture ; a part, probably the chief part, is incorporated with the matter which forms the tissue, and is in a state of union with it, more intimate than could well be ascribed to the mere inclusion of a fluid in the pores of another substance. Be this as it may, it is clear that the tissues, even in their inmost substance, are permeable to fluids, and this property is indeed necessary, not only to maintain their due softness, pliancy, elasticity, and other mechanical qualities, but also to allow matters to be conveyed into and out of their substance in the process of nutrition. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Ultimate Constituents.—The human body is capable of being resolved by ultimate analysis into chemical elements, or simple constituents, not differ- ing in nature from those which compose mineral substances. Of the chemical elements known to exist in nature, the following have been discovered in the human body, though it must be remarked, that some of them occur only in exceedingly minute quantity, if indeed they are constant : oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, chlo- rine, fluorine, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, silicon, man- ganese, aluminium, copper. Proximate Constituents.—The ultimate elements do not directly form the textures or fluids of the body ; they first combine to form certain com- pounds, and these appear as the more immediate constituents of the animal substance ; at least the animal tissue or fluid yields these compounds, and they in their turn are decomposed into the ultimate elements. Of the immediate constituents some are found also in the mineral kingdom, as for example, water, chloride of sodium or common salt, and carbonate of lime ; others, such as albumen, fibrin, and fat, are peculiar to organic bodies, and are accordingly named the proximate organic principles. The animal proximate principles have the following leading characters : They all contain carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and the greater number also nitrogen ; they are all decomposed by a red heat ; and except- ing the fatty and acid principles, they are, for the most part, extremely prone to putrefaction, or spontaneous decomposition, at least, when in a moist state ; the chief products to which their putrefaction gives rise being water, carbonic acid, ammonia, and sulphuretted, phosphuretted, and carbu- retted hydrogen gases. The immediate compounds found in the solids and fluids of the human body are the following : I. Azotised Substances, or such as contain nitrogen, viz., albumen, blood- fibrin, muscle-fibrin (or syntonin), casein, globulin, gelatin, chondrin, extractive soluble in alcohol, extractive soluble in water, salivin, kreatin, kreatiniue, pepsin, mucus, horny matter or keratin, pigment, heematin, pyin,

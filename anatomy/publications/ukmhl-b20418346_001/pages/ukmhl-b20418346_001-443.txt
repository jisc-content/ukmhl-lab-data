Fig. 170.â€”Superficial View op the Muscles op the Trunk, Shoulder and Hip (after Bour- gery). i o, occipital protuberance; C, transverse process of the atlas ; D, first dorsal vertebra ; L, first lum- bar vertebra ; S, upper piece of the sacrum; Co, first piece of the coccyx; a, acromion; b, base of the scapula; i, crest of the ilium ; 1, upper and back part of the sterno- mastoid muscle, spreading from the mastoid process to the superior curved line of the occipital bone ; 2, splenius, levator anguli scapulae, and other deep muscles ; 3, 3', upper and lower ends of the trapezius muscle ; 3', triangular tendon at- tached to the base of the spine of the scapula ; +, half of the oval tendon belonging to the two trape- zius muscles in the lower cer- vical and upper dorsal region; 4, 4, latissimus dorsi; 4', 4" line along which the latissimus dorsi takes origin from the lumbar fascia ; 5, infraspinatus ; 6, teres minor; 7, teres major; 8, middle or acromial part of the deltoid ; 9, hinder part of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen; 10, gluteus medius, covered by the aponeurosis of the fascia lata ; 11, 11, line of origin of the gluteus maximus from the posterior part of the ilium to the coccyx; 11' its inser- tion into the fascia lata over the trochanter major; 11", a part of its insertion into the femur; 12, biceps ; 13, semitendinosus; 14, adductor magnus ; 15, gracilis. The latissimus dorsi is super- ficial, except at its origin from the dorsal vertebrae, where it is covered by the trapezius, and at its inser- tion, where it dips into the axilla. It rests on part of the rhomboideus major and infraspinatus, on the teres major, serratus posticus in- ferior, vertebral aponeurosis, ex- ternal intercostal muscles, and the posterior borders of the external and internal oblique muscles. Between the adjacent borders of the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and rhomboideus major, there is left, when the scapula is drawn for- ward, a triangular area, in which a portion of one or two ribs and an intercostal space becomes super- ficial ; this is taken advantage of for the purpose of auscultation.

468 VEINS OF THE UPPER LIMB. exist in their whole course. Thus, those which lie beneath the integument are connected to each other by branches in the hand and forearm. The veins in each pair of venee comites are also united by short transverse vessels crossing the artery which they accompany, whilst between those attending different arteries frequent connections exist. Lastly, the sub- cutaneous and the deep veins communicate freely, especially in the neigh- bourhood of joints. This general anastomosis ensures the continuance of the circulation during muscular action in the frequent and varied motions of the limb. AXILLARY VEIN. The axillary vein returns all the blood from the upper limb : its size is very considerable, and it is the highest of the veins of the upper limb in which valves are constantly found. It extends, like the corresponding artery, from the lower border of the axilla to the outer margin of the first rib ; it is covered by the pectoral muscles and the costo-coracoid membrane, and is placed to the inner side of the axillary artery. It is continuous below with the basilic vein of the arm, either alone or in conjunction with one of the deep brachial veins. Fig. 319. Fig. 819.—View of the Bloodvessels op the Right Axilla and Arm from the inner side (from R. Quain). ~ The detailed description of this figure will be found at p. 382. The following numbers indicate the principal veins :—2, the axillary vein ; 3, basilic vein; 3', median basilic ; 4, 4', cephalic vein joining the acromial thoracic and axillary ; 6, alar-thoracic and subscapular ; 7, one of the brachial veins. Tributaries.—The axillary vein receives the subcutaneous veins of the arm, viz. the basilic at its commencement, the cephalic towards its termination; and between these the companion veins of the brachial artery ; it is also joined by the several veins corresponding with the branches of the axillary

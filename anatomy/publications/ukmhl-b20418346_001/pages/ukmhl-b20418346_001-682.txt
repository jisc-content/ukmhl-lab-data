FEMORAL ARTERY. 440 muscles. They vary in number from two to seven. They supply the sartorius and the vastus internus, with other muscles which are close to fibres of the vastus internus muscle Fig. 301.—Posterior View of the Arteries of the Pelvis, Thigh, and Popliteal Space (from Tiedemaun). \. a, the iliac crest ; b, the great sacro-sciatic ligament attached to the tuberosity of the ischium ; c, great trochanter; d, the integu- ment close to the anus; e, great sciatic nerve ; /, the line from this letter crosses the tendons of the inner hamstring muscles; g, head of the fibula ; 1, gluteal artery ; 2, pudic; 3, sciatic artery, giving its branches to the short external rotator muscles, to the sciatic nerve, and to the upper part of the long flexor muscles ; 4, first perforating artery ; 4', its branches to the flexor muscles ; 5, branches of the second perforating ; 6, branches of the third perforating; 7, popliteal artery, near this the origin of the superior muscular branches ; 8, placed on the ten- don of the adductor magnus near the origin of the superior articular branches ; 9, the anastomosis of the external superior articular with other branches ; 10, the sural branches; 11, the recurrent of the anterior tibial artery. the femoral artery : their size appears to bear an inverse proportion to that of the de- scending branches of the external circumflex artery. IV. Anastomotic arteky. —Close to its termination the femoral artery gives off a branch, constant but of moderate size, named the anastomotic artery (anasto- motica magna), which descends in the same line as the femoral artery itself (see fig. 298). Arising from that vessel when about to enter the popliteal space, itdescends upon the ten- don of the adductor magnus to the inner condyle of the femur, giving off several branches, and covered by some of the it finally anastomoses with the

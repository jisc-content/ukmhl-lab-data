66 Sect. I. and slightly convex from side to side: before the neck is a sharp concavity, into which the M. pterygoideus externus is inserted ; this is bounded anteriorly, by the coronoid pro- cess, p. coronoid.es, which is angular, it passes down a little way sharp in front, and then divides into two legs, which are lost, one on the alveolar process, and the other on the side of the jaw ; about an inch below the middle of the concavity, between the condyloid and coronoid processes, on the inside, are the inferior maxillary holes, foramina maxillaria inferior a, having a spinous process, p. spinosus, at the inner edge of each, for the attachment of a ligament) and from below this a furrow runs downwards, and forwards, in which a nerve rests. Between the inferior maxillary and mental holes, a canal, the infra maxillary canal, canalis infra maxillaris, runs within the bone, under the alveolar cavities, for the lodgement of the dental nerve and vessels. The Foramina in this bone are two pairs. Foramina maxillaria inferior a, through which the dental arteries and nerves enter the canal, and the Foramina mentalia, by which they pass out. Junction. By capsular and lateral ligaments with the glenoid cavities of the ossa temporum, having an interarticular cartilage between them. The muscles attached to the os maxillare inferius are twelve pairs; viz. externally M. masseteres, depressores anguli oris, depressores & levatores labii inferiors ; internally M. tem- porales, pterygoidei externi & intend, buccinatores, mylo hyoidei, genio hyoidei, digastrici, & genio hyo glossi: the M. platysma myoides passes over it.

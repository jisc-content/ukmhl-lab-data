In addition to this, the urethra is formed in its passage by the corpus spongiosum and prostate ; and at the membranous part by condensed cellular membrane and muscular fibres. In the prostate the lining membrane forms the projection, which has been before noticed, called the Veru Montanum, caput gallinaginis. This is of a reddish colour, broad behind and narrow before; and here the ducts of the vesiculae seminales, prostate gland, and vasa deferentia terminate.

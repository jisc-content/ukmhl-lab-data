Sect. I. 49 cess, which is usually hollowed, and upon it the optic nerves decussate, or at least join : on each side of this process, and extending back over the sella tursica are the anterior clinoid processes, processus clinoides anteriores, two in number, having in their roots the optic holes, foramina optica; some- times the anterior and posterior clinoid processes are united by a slip of bone running from one to the other; at other times a little bony process is sent down from the anterior clinoid processes to the outer edges of the processus olivaris, so that the transverse artery of the brain passes through complete foramina; extending forwards and outwards from the anterior clinoid processes and terminating in points as they pass out, are the transverse spinous processes, processus transverso spinosi, which are thin and triangular, their bases attached to the body of the bone, and their points extending outwards : in front of the body is the ethmoidal spine, spina ethmoidalis; below and before which is the ethmoidal pro- cess, processus ethmoidalis: the body contains the two sphe- noidal sinuses, sinus sphenoidales, divided by a plate of bone and opening into the superior chamber of the nose ; on its under surface is the single process, 2irocessus azygos> on either side of which are the parts called by some anatomists the triangular bones, ossa triangularia, and described by them as distinct bones; they merely form the floor of the sinuses and the roof of the spheno palatine holes, foramina spheno pa/atina, by which the spheno palatine nerves pass into the nose: the occipital surface of the bone faces rather down- wards and is rough, forming the basilar process, processus hasilaris; on each side of which is a deep notch, forming part of the foramen caroticum : on each side of the body is a groove for the internal carotid artery. The Temporal Portions v Â» Are placed to the outer sides of the imaginary lines above described; they pass first outwards, and afterwards upwards laterally, and forwards : they are hollowed within,?and form, with the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bones, the cavities for lodging the middle lobes of the cere- brum ; whilst the anterior ascending part separates the general cavity of the skull from the orbits. Between the anterior inner edge of the temporal portion and the trans- verse spinous process, is situated the superior lacerated orbitar hole, foramen lucerum orhitare superius, of an irre- gular shape, largest below and to the inside, and becoming pointed as it extends outwards; behind and below it is the round hole, foramen rotundum; extending backwards E

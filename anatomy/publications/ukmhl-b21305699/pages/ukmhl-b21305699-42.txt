16 Sect. I. The cdvity, or true 'pelvis, is placed between the brim and the outlet; it is deepest posteriorly, not so deep laterally, and shallowest anteriorly. Forming the front of the true pelvis are the pubes, the junction of the rami of which at the symphysis produces the arch of the pubis; this in the male is very acute, but in the female it is obtuse for the purpose of increasing the size of the outlet to facilitate delivery. On each side of the arch of the pubis is found a large hole, the obturator hole, foramen obturator, the margin of which is very sharp for the attach- ment of ligaments, except at the upper and outer part where it is rounded for the passage of the obturator artery, vein, and nerve. Still further outwards are found the acetabula or articular cavities for the heads of the thigh bones, which have been before described. With respect to the axis of the pelvis, it-is so placed, that the trunk does not rest upon the outlet, but upon the tube- rosities of the ischia, so that the outlet faces downwards and backwards, and the brim upwards and forwards, in such way, that a line raised perpendicular-with the middle of the brim, will pass upwards and forwards through the umbilicus. This oblique bearing of the pelvis is particularly important in sur- gical and obstetric practice connected with the pelvis. The differences between the male and female pelvis, may briefly be said to consist in the greater lateral diameter of the brim, in the greater extent of the outlet, in the greater width of the arch of the pubis, and the greater distance between the acetabula in the female than in the male.

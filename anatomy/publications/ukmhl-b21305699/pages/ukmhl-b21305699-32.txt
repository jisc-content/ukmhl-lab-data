I. others, broader than their depth ; their long axes from side to side, and slightly concave from behind to before, both above and below: articular processes perpendicular, the two upper concave, facing backwards and inwards, the two lower convex, facing forwards and outwards : transverse processes slender, and passing backwards and outwards, inclining at the same time rather upwards : spinous process deep, long, horizontal, and flattened at the sides: spinal hole triangular: notches large. Differences in particular Vertebrae of each Division. Among the cervical vertebra, the first, second and seventh differ from the others. The first vertebra or Atlas, scarcely resembles a vertebra, consisting merely of a bony ring, the anterior part of which is hollowed out in place of the body, for the dentiform process of the second vertebra, and has an articular surface on its poste- rior surface for the front of that process ; the superior articular processes irregularly oval, their long axes from behind to before concave in the same direction, and facing upwards and in- wards ; the inferior broad, and nearly flat, facing downwards and inwards : transverse processes not bifid but large, and originating from between the upper and lower articular pro- cesses, inclining slightly downwards ; a groove extending on each side from the back of the hole in the transverse process, along the upper edges of the arch, and winding round the back of the roots of the upper articular processes for the ver- tebral artery to make its turn : spinal hole large : notches situated behind the roots of the articular processes. The second vertebra, vertebra dentata vel axis, is re- markable for a strong toothlike process or pivot, the denti- form process, p. dentaius, which rises from the upper part of the body, has an oval articular surface on its front, and is received into the hollow of the Atlas : the superior articular processes very broad and nearly flat, face upwards and out- wards, and are situated immediately to the outside of the dentiform process; the inferior placed below and behind them, face forwards and downwards : the transverse processes very small and single, originate from the outsides of the superior articular processes ; the holes in them not perpendicular, but passing upwards and outwards : the spinal hole large : the superior notches behind the upper articular, the inferior before the lower articular processes. The seventh vertebra differs from the other cervical, in beino- larger, in having the transverse processes single, with a hole in each for the transmission of the vertebral veins, and

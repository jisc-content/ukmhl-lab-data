224 Sect. ill. The ligaments which connect the occiput to these ver- tebrae, are a. Between the Occiput and Atlas, 1. Anterior Ligament. Is a continuation of the anterior ligament of the spine. It is a broad ligamentous expansion, which is continued from the anterior arch of the atlas to the anterior edge of the foramen magnum. 2. Posterior Ligament. Is a similar broad but thinner ligamentous expansion, which is extended between the posterior arch of the atlas to the posterior edge of the fora- men magnum. 3. Capsular of the Articular Surfaces. Each of these surfaces has a synovial membrane, which is strength- ened on the exterior by ligamentous fibres. b. Between the Occiput and the Vertebra Dentata. 1. Perpendicular Ligament. Ligamentum rectum medium. Extends from the point of the dentiform process of the second vertebra to the edge of the foramen magnum. It consists of straight fibres, but which are fre- quently not very strong nor distinct. 2. Lateral Ligaments. Ligamenta lateralia. Arise from the sides of the processus dentatus : they pass ob- liquely upwards and outwards, and are fixed to the inner edge of the foramen magnum. They are short, but strong, and have & rounded form. e. Of the Atlas. 1. Transverse Ligament, Ligamentum atlan- tis transversale. Is composed of transverse fibres, which arise from one side of the atlas, pass across behind the pro- cessus dentatus, and are fixed to the opposite side of the atlas. Between it and the dentiform process is a synovial capsule. The edges of this ligament extend upwards and downwards, and form two processes called its appendices, which are fixed to the foramen magnum and processus dentatus. d. Between the First and Second Vertebra. The articulating surfaces are connected by loose synovial

To draw the angle of the mouth backwards, and to lessen the cavity of the mouth, so as to thrust the food be- tween the teeth. 10. M. Orbicularis Oris, Sphincter Laliorum. Situation. It surrounds the mouth, being a sphincter mus- cle, and forms a considerable part of the lips. It seems to be formed in a great measure by the muscles which have been just described: their fibres decussating at the corners of the mouth, and running along the lips. Use. To shut the mouth, and to antagonize all the other muscles. A portion of this muscle, attached to the septum of the nose, is sometimes described as a separate muscle, under the name of the M. nasalis lahii superioris. c. Maxillary, containing four muscles which elevate the lower jaw. 1. M. Masseter. Situation. It covers a considerable part of the side of the lower jaw, and is itself partially covered by the parotid gland. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the superior maxillary bone, where it joins with the os malse, and from the whole length of the under and internal part of the zygoma. The external part of the muscle consists of fibres which have an oblique direction backwards, and the internal part of fibres which are directed downwards and forwards. It forms a very strong muscle, of which the fleshy fibres are intermixed with tendon. Insertion. Into the angle of the lower jaw, and into the external part of that bone upwards to the coronoid process. Use. To shut the mouth, by raising the lower jaw. 2. M. Temporalis. Situation. On the temple : the zygomatic arch and origin of the masseter must be removed to see its insertion. The origin and situation of this muscle have been already described. See page 146. Its insertion may now be traced. Insertion, By a strong tendon into the coronoid process

415 Sect. VI. CHAPTER II. Of the Mouth, and Parts connected with it. The Mouth is formed, anteriorly, by the lips; behind, by the velum palati and the opening to the pharynx; above, by the palatine vault; below, by the tongue and membrane of the mouth; on the sides, by the cheeks. The bony parts are the ossa maxillaria superiora, the ossa palati, the maxilla inferior, and the teeth. The soft parts are,' the lips, cheeks, gums, palate, tongue, membrane lining the mouth, and salivary glands. Lips and Cheeks. The lips are distinguished by the name of superior and inferior. They terminate by an edge, more or less thick, which is remarkable for its red colour, when compared with the neighbouring skin. They are united at the outer angles, by the commissures. Exter- nally, the superior has a longitudinal depression from the septum of the nose, called the filtrum. Internally, they are covered by the membrane of the mouth, which about the middle forms a fold, named the freeman, connecting each lip to the corresponding maxillary bone. Upon the edges of the lips, which are covered by a continuation of the membrane of the mouth, are numerous tine villi, which may be distinguished after a fine injection, and the removal of the cuticle by mace- ration. The lips and cheeks are formed of muscles, common integuments, membranes, glands, and their vessels and nerves. Between the masseter and buccinator, the space is occupied by a large quantity of fat. The glands of the lips and cheeks are small rounded bodies, situated beneath the internal mem- brane in considerable number. They have each an excretory duct, by means of which they pour out a viscid fluid to lubri- cate the adjacent parts. Those on the lips are named the labial glandsâ€”those on the cheek, the buccal. Tongue. Occupies the space of the arch of the inferior maxilla between the teeth. It is divided into its body, base, and apex. On the body are distinguished an upper and

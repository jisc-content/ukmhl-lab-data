Sect. III. 221 CHAPTER V. Of the Articulations of the Head, Spine, and Thorax. ยง 1. ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. This articulation has two lateral ligaments; a capsule of synovial membrane, and an interarticular cartilage. 1. External Lateral Ligament. Ligamen- tum maxillae laterale externum. Consists of strong per- pendicular fibres, which arise from the posterior extremity of the zygoma, descend upon the synovial capsule, and are in- serted into the outer side of the neck of the lower jaw. 2. Internal Lateral Ligament. Ligamentum laterale internum. Consists of a thin tendinous layer which arises from the styloid process of the temporal bone, passes obliquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, and is attached to the lower jaw, below the inferior maxillary foramen. The Synovial Membrane. Forms a double sack, one of which is above and the other below the inter- articular cartilage. It is continued above to the edge of the glenoid cavity, and below to the circumference of the con- dyloid process of the lower jaw, being so united, in the in- terval, to the interarticular cartilage, that the two cavities have no communication with each other. It is so loose as to admit of considerable and easy movement of the lower jaw. The Interarticular Cartilage. Is of an oval figure, and is placed horizontally. It is hollowed out both above and below,. and is thicker at the circumference than in the centre, and thicker behind than before, so as to adapt its upper surface to the articular eminence and glenoid cavity of the temporal bone. Besides the ligaments above-mentioned, there is a process of condensed cellular membrane intermixed with some liga- mentous fibres, and called the

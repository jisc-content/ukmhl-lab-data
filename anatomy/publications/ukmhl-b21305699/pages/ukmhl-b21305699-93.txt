67 Sect. I. CHAPTER VIII. Of the Orbits, Nostrils, and Palate. The Bones of the Head form several cavities, of which are 1. THE ORBITS. Orbitce. These are two in number and formed for the reception of the organs of vision. They are irregular conical cavities, si- tuated in the upper part of the face immediately below the frontal bone, having their bases facing forwards and outwards and their apices inwards and backwards. Each orbit is composed of seven bones, viz. Os frontis. Os palati, Os sphenoides, Os lachrymale, and Os ethmoides. Os males; Os maxillare superius, Whilst three single bones and four pairs form both orbits. Of these above is placed the orbitar plate of the os frontis; on the inside anteriorly, the nasal process of the os maxillare superius ; behind it the os lachrymale ; posterior to it the flat plate of the os ethmoides; and in the back of the orbit the os sphenoides ; below anteriorly are the orbitar processes of the os maxillare superius, os malae & os palati, and on the out- side the orbitar processes of the os malÂ® & os sphenoides. The Foramina in the orbits are, eight pairs, 1. Superior openings of the ductus ad nasum, 2. Foramina frontalia, 3. ethmoulea interna anterior'<}, 4. interna posterior a, 5. lacera orb it aria, 6. optica, 7- Posterior openings of the infra orbitary canals, and 8. The large anterior openings of the orbits. The Jissurce sp/ieno maxillares are also found, one in each orbit.

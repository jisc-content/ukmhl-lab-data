INTRODUCTION. Anatomy may be regarded either as an independent science, or as subservient to the purposes of medical and surgical practice ; each therefore demanding for its acquirement a dif- ferent mode, according as the one or the other may be the object of the student. The present work is appropriated to Anatomy as adapted to practical uses, its aim being to point out all those objects which most require the attention of the beginner in this point of view. From the different plans by which the ends above-men- tioned may be attained, we have selected the one which ex- perience has led us to prefer as uniting the most important practical advantages. This union appeared most attainable by taking the mean between two extremes, that, namely, of being determined wholly by the local relations ; and that of dividing the whole body into the several systems of muscles, vessels, nerves, &c. and of pursuing each by itself with an almost entire neglect of its relative positions to the parts of other systems. We have endeavoured to combine the' ad- vantages of both, by so far availing ourselves of the former, as not to neglect the blending of the structures which com- pose the different portions of the body, while we adhere to the latter in tracing the several components of its structure distinctly and separately ; so as to prevent on the one hand the confusion that would arise in consequence of frequent and rapid transitions from one part to the other, and yet on the other hand to preserve a facility of recombining the whole in the mindâ€™s view, while the relative positions are fresh in the memory.

Sect. III. 145 SECTION III. THE DISSECTION OF THE HEAD, NECK, AND CHEST. CHAPTER I. Of the Head. ยง 1. OF THE MUSCLES ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE CRANIUM, DISTRIBUTED INTO REGIONS. a. Epicranial, containing one muscle, M. OcCIPITO-FRONTALIS. Situation. It covers the whole of the cranium between the greater transverse ridge of the os occipitis and the super- ciliary ridges of the os frontis; it is a thin broad digastric muscle: it is best to begin the dissection of it from the pos- terior part. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the arched ridge of the os occipitis and root of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Its fleshy fibres ascend upon the occiput, and termi- nate in a thin broad tendon, which covers the vertex, and part of the sides, of the head. At the upper part of the fore- head it again becomes fleshy, and descends upon the frontal bone. Insertion. Into the skin of the eyebrows, intermixed with the orbicularis palpebrarum, and sends a fleshy slip by the side of the nose, which intermixes with the compressor naris and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. Use. It pulls the skin of the head backwards, and raises the eyehrows, at the same time wrinklimr the skin of the fore- head. 'lhe tendon of this muscle firmly adheres to the skin, but is L *

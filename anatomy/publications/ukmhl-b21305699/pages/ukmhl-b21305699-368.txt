342 Sect. V, CHAPTER III. Of the Veins. In the following account of the distribution of the veins, these vessels arc described like the arteries, from trunk to branch, therefore contrary to the course of the- blood which flows through them. By so doing, the description is rendered more simple 5 for as the greater number of veins accompany the arteries, it will be only necessary to refer to the particulars of the course of the corresponding arteries in order to explain the distribution of the accompanying veins. There are, how- ever, some veins which do not take the course of the corre- sponding arteries, and there are others to which there are no corresponding arteries ; it will be therefore requisite to par- ticularize the course and distribution of these two sets of vessels. The vena portae and its branches, and the vessels which return the blood from the brain, have been described in the account of the viscera to which they belong. Seven Primitive Veins are usually described, viz. those which pour their contents immediately into the heart—vena CAVA SUPERIOR, VENA CAVA INTERIOR, CORONARY VEIN, and the four pulmonary veins ; of these the pulmonary and coronary veins have been treated of with the lungs and heart. The veins, therefore, the course and distribution of which remain to be spoken of, and which furnish the branches ac- companying, and returning the blood from the ramifications of the aortic system, are the vena cava superior, and inferior. § 1. VENA CAVA SUPERIOR. The Superior Cava furnishes the branches which supply the head, neck, upper extremity, and parietes of the chest. It arises from the upper and right part of the right auricle, ascends as high as the cartilage of the first rib, and a little above the curvature of the aorta divides into two considerable trunks, called the subclavian veins. In its course it is sur-

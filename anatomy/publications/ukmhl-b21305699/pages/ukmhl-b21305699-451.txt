Sect. VI. 425 CHAPTER IV. Of the Larynx and its Appendages. The Larynx consists of several movable cartilages con- nected by ligaments, together with muscles and membranes, forming a cavity of an irregular figure. It is situated super- ficially at the upper part of the trachsea, and below the os hyoides, with both which it is connected. Behind it rests on the bodies of the vertebrae and pharynx. The Cartilages are five in number, viz. the thyroid, cricoid, the two arytjenoid, and the epiglottis. Thyroid Cartilage. The thyroid, or shield- like cartilage, which is the largest of the five, is placed at the upper and fore part of the larynx. It is larger above than below, and its breadth exceeds its length. It consists of two lateral quadrangular portions united in the middle at an angle more or less acute, which may be felt beneath the integu- ments. This is more prominent in men than in women, and is called the pomum Adami. The upper part of this angle is formed into a notch. The lateral portions, or alee, have a plane, or but slightly concave, surface, covered principally by the M. thyreo-hyoidei. An oblique and projecting line extends upon this surface, and gives attachment to the M. sterno- thyroideus & constrictor pharyngis inferior. These surfaces are terminated by four edges; the superior and more considerable of which, conjointly with the notch, gives attachment to a broad ligament, by which it is fixed to the under part of the os hyoides. The inferior edge is shorter and concave in the middle; while the posterior edges have an oblique direction, and are concave above and convex below; and are terminated at the corners by processes called cornua. The two superior of which are more or less lengthened, and have an oblique direction backwards ; they are connected by round ligaments to the extremities of the cornua of the os hyoides. Jn the middle of these ligaments one or two small

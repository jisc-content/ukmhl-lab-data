Sect. II. 87 Use. T*> extend the hand inwards, and to assist in supi- nation. The tendon of this muscle, at the extremity of the radius, is surrounded by a synovial sheath, and there is a small bursa between its attachment and the metacarpal bone. 3. M. Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevior. Situation. Covered by the two last muscles, which must be removed to exhibit it. Origin. ^Tendinous from the outer condyle of the os hu- meri, and from the ligament which passes from it to the radius. It descends along the radius, and terminates below the former in a flat tendon, which passes upon the back part of the ra- dius, and under the annular ligament, taking the same course as the tendon of the extensor longior, with respect to the extensors of the thumb. Insertion. Into the back part of the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Use. Same as the last. Between the bone and its insertion is situated a small bursa. The tendons of both the above-described muscles are surrounded by synovial sheaths. 4. M. Supinator Radii Brevis. Situation. Surrounding the head and neck of the radius, and cannot be seen distinctly till the last muscle be removed. Origin. Tendin'ous without, and fleshy within, from the outer condyle of the os humeri, and from the outer and upper part of the ulna, and adheres to the capsule of the joint. Its fibres pass obliquely downwards and forwards over the upper part of the radius. Insertion. Into the upper part of the fore and inner sur- face of the radius ; it surrounds the head, neck, and tubercle of that bone, and extends as far as the insertion of the pronator teres. Use. To render the hand supine. ยง 7- ON THE HAND. a. Middle Palmar, containing the aponeurosis palmaris, lumbricales, and the tendons of the flexors of the fingers, has been already described. See pages 80 & 82. h. Outer Palmar, containing four muscles which form the ball of the thumb. I. M. Adductor Pollicis. Situation. Superficialon the outside of the ball of the thumb.

INTRODUCTION. XX and female pelvis wet,—to show, besides the relative position of the contents of the pelvis, the parts of inguinal and crural hernia. To these may be added a small subject, to show the distribution of the nerves, and preparations of particular parts, as of the lachrymal sack and duct, &c. These consulted as occasion may require, with the help of a work of anatomical reference, may keep up a competent knowledge of anatomy. These* then, are the uses of anatomical knowledge as acquired by dissection. In whatever age or country the knowledge of Anatomy has been absent, medical science has existed in one or other of two extremes : it has either groped in detail with a blind empiricism, or blundered by wholesale with a dreaming and presumptuous arrogance; in the one case, sinking below experience—in the other, soaring above it, into the empty regions of abstraction. That we are en- abled to take the middle path, we owe to the courage and industry of the great anatomists before us, more than to any other single cause. But there is one use to be derived from the study as at present pursued, which is negative indeed, but of scarcely less importance to the students as men, than the other and positive uses are to them as medical practitioners. By serious reflection on what Anatomy has not taught us, and what no Anatomy ever can teach us, the great laws of life, we learn not to overvalue the senses so as to forget the higher faculties of our nature, at the very time that we are most sensible that it is only by combining these writh the exercise of the senses, that wc can exert ourselves to any purposes of utility or of duty in that world of the senses which is the appointed sphere of both.

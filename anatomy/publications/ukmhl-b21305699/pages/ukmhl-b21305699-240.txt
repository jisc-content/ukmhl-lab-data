214 Sect. III. From the upper part of this muscle a round fleshy slip ascends and joins with the cervicalis descendens. 3. M. Spinalis Dorsi. Situation. Close on the side of the spinous processes of the back. Origin. From the spinous processes of the three under- most dorsal, and of the two uppermost lumbar vertebrae, by as many tendons. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of the nine upper- most dorsal vertebrae, except the first. Use. To extend the spine backwards. 4. M. Semispinalis Colli. Situation. Under the eomplexus, between the transverse and spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae. Origin. From the transverse processes of the six upper- most dorsal vertebrae, by distinct tendons, and runs obliquely under the eomplexus. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrae, except the first and last. Use. To extend the neck obliquely backwards; if both act, to draw it directly back. 5. M. Semispinalis Dorsi. Situation. Between the transverse and spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae. Origin. From the transverse processes of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of the two under- most cervical, and four uppermost dorsal vertebrae, by dis- tinct tendons. Use. To extend the neck obliquely back. âœ“ 6. M. Multifidus Spin2e. Situation. Close to the spine. Or igin. From the side and spinous processes of the os sacrum, from the posterior part of the spine of the os ilium, from the articular and transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae, and from the transverse processes of all the dorsal, and all the cervical, except the three first, by distinct tendons, which soon become fleshy, and take an oblique direction. Insertion. By distinct tendons into the spinous processes of all the vertebrae of the loins, of the back, and of the neck, except the first. Use. To move different portions of the spine laterally.

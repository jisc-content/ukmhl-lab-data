B THE DISSECTOR’S MANUAL. SECTION I. OSTEOLOGY. CHAPTER I. Of the Skeleton. “ ^ * * * * The Bones are those hard parts of the Human body com- posed principally of phosphate with a small portion of carbo- nate of lime deposited in an organized substance, consisting of gelatine, which is plentifully supplied with vessels, for the purpose of nourishment and growth. They serve to give support and form to the soft parts, to protect the more important organs, and to afford a series of levers, by means of which, through the agency of the muscles, locomotion is performed. The bones taken together form THE SKELETON, which is said to be either natural or artificial. It is called a natural skeleton, when the bones are kept together by their natural ligaments ; but this kind is of little use for practical purposes, as the extremities of the bones, which are very important, are so completely covered, that their form cannot be seen. It therefore becomes ne- cessary to remove all the soft parts, and join the bones together with wires, and thus is produced the artificial SKELETON.

Sect. II. 98 I CHAPTER II. Of the Joints of the Upper Extremity. The parts connected with the joints should be dissected after the muscles. If the soft parts surrounding them have become dry, it will be necessary to macerate them in water until the examination can be prosecuted with facility. During the dissection it will be right not only to observe the num- ber, strength, and disposition of the ligaments, but to pay attention also to the form and position of the cartilages and ligamento-cartilaginous substances connected with the joints ; £o that by connecting together all the circum- stances of structure, as they regard the bones, cartilages, and ligaments-, a knowledge will be acquired of the me- chanism, upon which the strength and the kind and extent of the motions in joints depend, and thus the mind may be led to contemplate the nature and treatment of the accidents to which they are liable. Consistently with the prescribed limits of this work, those circumstances only which regard structure can be explained ; but an attention is recommended to the other and more practical points aboye stated, during the inspection of the parts. The joints of the upper extremity are,—1. Those of the bones of the shoulder, including that of the sternal extremity of the clavicle with the trunk, and that of the scapular extremity with the scapula. 2. Shoulder joint. 3. Elbow joint. 4. Those of the radius and ulna, 5. Wrist joint. 6. Joints of the hand. § 1. ARTICULATIONS OF THE BONES OF THE SHOULDER. a. Op the Sterno Clavicular Articulation. The sternal extremity of the clavicle is received into a de- pression of the uppermost bone of the sternum, with which it is connected by a capsular ligament; and it is attached also by ligament to the clavicle of the opposite side, and to the first rib. The parts which form the articulation are si- tuated superficially * so that its situation, form, and motion

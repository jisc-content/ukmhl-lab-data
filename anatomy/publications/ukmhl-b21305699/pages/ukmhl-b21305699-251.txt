The heads of the ribs are each united to the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae by two ligaments. 1. Anterior Radiated Ligament. Ligamen- tum radiatuin anterius. The fibres of which this ligament is composed, pass in different directions from the sides of the bodies of every two vertebrae, and over the head of the rib to the front of which' it is attached. It is often called the Capsular Ligament. 2. Interarticular ' Ligament. Ligamentum inter articulate. This is a little band extending from the in- tervertebral substance to the head of the rib to which it is at- tached, and divides the articulation into two distinct cavities lined by synovial membrane. The tubercles of the ribs are united to the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae by synovial capsules, and the junction is strengthened by three ligaments. 1. Posterior External Costo Transverse Ligament. Ligamentum costo transversale posticum. Passes from the posterior part of the point of the transverse process upwards, and is inserted into the rib a little to the outer side of the tubercle. 2. Inferior Internal Costo Transverse Liga- ment. Ligamentum costo transversale inferius. Passes from the under edge of each transverse process into the upper part of the neck of the rib below that with which the pro- cess is connected. 3. Middle Costo Transverse Ligament. Ligamentum costo transversale medium. It cannot be seen but by cutting away the posterior ligament, and it then appears connecting the front of the transverse process with the neck of the rib. h. Of the Ribs with the Sternum. The greater number of the ribs are connected with the sternum either mediately or immediately by means Q

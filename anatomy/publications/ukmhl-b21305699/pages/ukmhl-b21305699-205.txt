Sect. III. 179 4. M. Depressor Anguli Oris. Situation. On the outside of the chin. Origin. Broad and fleshy from the outer edge of the fore and lateral part of the lower jaw. It runs over the origin of the depressor labii inferioris, becoming gradually narrower. Insertion. Into the angle of the mouth, intermixing with the zygomaticus major and levator anguli oris. Use. To antagonize the levator anguli oris. 5. M. Depressor Labii Inferioris. Situation. Upon the chin ; the posterior part of its origin covered by the last muscle. Origin. Broad and fleshy from the under part of the lower jaw, at the side of the chin, and runs obliquely upwards. Insertion. Iuto about half of the edge of the under lip. Use. To depress the lower lip. 6. M. Levator Labii Inferioris. Situation. Within the mouth ; the lower lip must be de- pressed, and the membrane of the mouth removed. Origin.

Tendinous and fleshy from a ridge extending be- tween the last molar tooth and the root of the coronoid pro- cess of the lower jaw; from the upper jaw between the last molar tooth and the root of the pterygoid process of the sphe- n 2

Sect. V. 287 CHAPTER II. Of the Arteries. § 1. AORTA. The primitive trunks of the arteries, or those which arise from the heart, are the Pulmonary Artery and the Aorta. The course and distribution of the pulmonary artery have been already given (p. 201.) We proceed, therefore, to the description of the Aorta. The Aorta Is the origin or common trunk of all the ramifications of the arterial system. It arises from the upper part of the left ventricle, from which it is distinguished at its commencement by difference of structure. It first ascends, then bends back- wards and towards the left side, opposite to the third or fourth dorsal vertebra; after which it descends within the posterior mediastinum, inclined to the left side of the dorsal vertebrae; it passes between the crura of the diaphragm, and, continuing its course along the lumbar vertebrae, terminates at the fourth or fifth vertebra. The different portions of the aorta thus described as taking different directions, are distin- guished by the corresponding names of—1. the ascending aorta, 2. the curvature or arch of the aorta, and 3. the descend- ing aorta; the latter of which is divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. 1. Ascending Aorta. Is enclosed during the greater part of its course by the pericardium. To its left is situated the pulmonary artery, which covers it anteriorly at its beginning : to its right, the vena cava superior; behind it, the right branch of the pulmonary artery : and before it, the sternum, from which it is separated by the anterior mediastinum. 2. Arch of the Aorta. Is situated immediately before the under end of the trachaea. The curve of the vessel being continued over the left bronchus, descends immediately behind it and the left pulmonary artery.

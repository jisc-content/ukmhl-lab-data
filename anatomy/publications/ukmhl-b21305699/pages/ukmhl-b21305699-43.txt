Sect. I. CHAPTER III. Of the Upper Extremity. The upper extremity consists of the shoulder, upper arm, fore arm and hand, these are connected by the clavicle to the trunk, and that is the only bony union ; the other con- nections being by muscles. 1. THE SHOULDER, Scapula, Consists of the clavicle and scapula. THE CLAVICLE. Clavicula. Situation. At the upper part of the chest, horizontally between the sternum and the scapula. Description. The clavicle, so called from its resemblance to an ancient key, is divided into body, two extremities, two articular surfaces, and two processes ; its shape is that of an italic S, and it is placed horizontally ; its inner or sternal ex- tremity is very large, and irregularly cylindrical; upon its point is a large articular surface, by which it joins with the interarticular cartilage placed between it and the sternum ; about an inch from the sternal extremity on the under edge is a rough surface, the rhomboid process, p. rhomboides, by which it is attached to a ligament; it then becomes smooth and rounded, projects forwards, and afterwards backwards, having the hole for the medullary artery on its under surface, and about three-fourths from the sternal extremity projects forward again, becomes considerably expanded, and forms the scapular extremity, which is the flattest part of the bone ; about an inch and a half from the outer point, and on its under surface, is a rough process called the tubercle, tuber, for the attachment of ligaments ; and upon the outer part of the scapular extremity a plane articular surface for the acromion of the scapula. Connection. With the first bone of the sternum by its inner, and with the acromial process of the scapula by its outer extremity. The muscles attached to the clavicle are six, to its under part M. pectoralis major, deltoides, & subclivius; and to its upper part M. trapezius, sterno mastoideus, & sterno hyoideus. c

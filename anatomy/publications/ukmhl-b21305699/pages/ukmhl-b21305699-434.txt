408 Sect. VI. beginning it from the junction of the malar and maxillary- bones. In performing this dissection great care is required in taking away the fat and cellular membrane, lest the nerves should be also removed. The preceding description will suffice for the situation of the muscles in the Ocular Region, which consists of seven. 1. M. Levator PalkebrjE Superiors. Origin. From the back part of the orbit near the upper margin of the foramen opticum. It passes forwards, becom- ing broader in its passage. Insertion. By a broad thin tendon into nearly the whole length of the cartilage of the upper eyelid. 2. M. Levator Oculi. Origin. From the upper margin of the foramen opticum of the sphenoid bone, below the levator palpebrae superioris. Insertion. By a broad thin tendon into the superior and fore part of the tunica sclerotica. 3. M. Depressor Oculi. Origin. From the lower part of the foramen opticum. Insertion. Into the tunica sclerotica, opposite the former. 4. M. Adductor Oculi. Origin. From the inner part of the foramen opticum, be- tween the obliquus superior and depressor oculi. Insertion. Into the inner and fore part of the sclerotic coat. 5. M. Abductor Oculi. Origin. From the bony partition between the foramen opticum and foramen lacerum. Insertion. Into the outer and fore part of the sclerotic coat. 6. M. Obliqutjs Superior. Origin. From the edge of the foramen opticum, between the levator and adductor. It runs along the flat plate of the ethmoid bone to the upper part of the orbit, where a cartilaginous trochlea is fixed to the inside of the internal angular process of the os frontis, through which its tendon passes ; then runs outward and downward, enclosed in a loose membranous sheath. Insertion. Into the tunica sclerotica, midway between the insertion of the levator oculi and the entrance of the optic nerve. 7- M. Obliquus Inferior. Origin. By a narrow beginning from the outer edge of

363 Sect. V. CHAPTER V, Of the Nerves. The Nerves are divided into three classes:—1. The cerebral nerves, or those which arise from the brain :—2. The spinal nerves, or those which arise from the spinal cord; and 3. The sympathetic nerves. They consist collectively, including the sympathetic, of forty-three pairs. Different anatomists have adopted different modes of enumeration and of classification. These differences have principally arisen from considering as portions of nerves some which have been here numbered as distinct, increasing the number of spinal nerves by those which take their origin from the medulla oblongata, or in- creasing that of the cerebral nerves by those which are here considered as originating from the spinal cord, or lastly from not distinguishing the sympathetic as a peculiar pair or system of nerves. In the following description we consider The Cerebral Nerves to consist of eleven pairs, viz. 1. Olfactory. 2. Optic. 3. Common oculo-muscular, 4. Inner oculo-muscular. 5. Trigeminal. 6. Outer oculo-muscular. 7. Auditory. 8. Facial. 9. Glosso-pharyngeal. 10. Pneumo gastric. 11. Lingual. The Spinal Nerves are described as consisting of thirty-one pairs, viz. One Accessory. One Sub-occipital. Seven Cervical. Twelve Dorsal. Five Lumbar. Five Sacral,

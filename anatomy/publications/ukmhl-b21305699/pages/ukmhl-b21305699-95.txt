Seci. I. 69 PECULIARITIES IN THE FCETAL SKULL. The bones of the skull in the foetus are not completely formed; in order that the head may be enabled to mould itself to the form of the pelvis whilst passing through it in parturition. The os frontis is divided into two portions by the continua- tion of the sagittal suture into the ethmoidal fissure. The os temporis consists only of two portions, which are separate, viz. the squamous and petrous ; the mamillary por- tion not being formed till some years after birth. The os occipitis is divided into four pieces, the crucial ridge not having become ossified. The ossa parietalia have neither their frontal nor occipital angles formed; and consequently two large chasms are formed, one in front with the frontal bone, which is also de- ficient at that spot; and the other behind with the occipital bone, which is also deficient; these two openings are called the fontanels, bregmata vel fontanellce.

Sect. VI. 404 SECTION VI. THE DISSECTION OF THE ORGANS OF THE SENSES. CHAPTER I. Of the Eye. I he Organ of Vision, situated within the orbit, consists of the globe of the eye and its appendages. § 1. OF THE APPENDAGES. The Appendages are— Eyebrows. Supercilia. Are slight eminences of the common integuments, somewhat arched in figure, placed on the superciliary ridges, and covered by short hairs, the roots of which are towards the nose, whilst their points are directed outwards. Eyelids. Palpebrce. The upper eyelid begins from the eyebrow, is larger, and, when depressed, nearly co- vers the anterior part of the eye. The under and smaller eyelid begins from the cheek. The eyelids have the skin upon them furrowed. They are joined, and form angles at their extremities, distinguished by the names of inner and outer canlhus. The lids are formed by a fold of common in- tegument, which at this part is extremely thin. In each of them there is found a thin semicircular fibrous layer, ap- proaching to cartilage, called the tarsus, and the upper tarsus is broader than the lower. They are closely united to the edges of the orbit, especially at the outer side, by an ex- panded ligamentous substance. To the inner side they ter- minate at a little distance from the inner angle, and are con- nected by the tendon of the orbicularis palpebrarum. At the

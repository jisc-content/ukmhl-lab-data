Sect. III. 183 CHAPTER II. Of the Muscles of the fore part of the Neck, distributed into Regions, and of some parts similarly situated. § I- Make an incision from the junction of the chin with the side of the lower jaw, clown to the middle of the clavicle, dissect the skin back cautiously, and expose the a. Superficial Cervical Region, which contains two muscles. 1. M. Platysma Myoides. Musculus cutaneus. Situation. Immediately under the skin of the side of the neck; it consists of a thin muscular expansion. Origin. By a number of thin fleshy slips, from the cellu- lar substance, which covers the upper parts of the deltoid and pectoral muscles. These slips pass obliquely upwards, along the side of the neck. Insertion. Into the side of the lower jaw, and the skin which covers the lower part of the masseter muscle and parotid gland, and is connected with the depressor anguli oris. Use. To wrinkle the skin on the side of the neck; it also serves the purpose of a sheath to the muscles situated on the front of the neck. Under the platysma myoides is found a tough membranous structure, particularly described of late under the name of Cervical Fascia, Aponeurosis Cervicalis. It dips down amongst the muscles, filling’ up the interstices be- tween them, and seems, indeed, to exist, more or less, in all parts of the body, and to be nothing more than the common reticular membrane, which is locally stronger and thicker, from original conformation, motion or pressure, and for the purposes of support or resistance. It will, probably, be found strongest in those who have become thin after a state of obesity.

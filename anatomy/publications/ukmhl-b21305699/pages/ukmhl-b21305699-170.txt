144 Sect. II. Ligaments between the Os Cuboides and the Os Cunei forme externum, Li gam. cuboideo-cuneiformia. These likewise consist of plantar and dorsal liga- ments, and there is a distinct synovial membrane. Ligaments between the Ossa Cuneiformia, Lig. cu> neifortnia. Consist of irregular bands, called the interosse- ous, the dorsal, and the plantar ligaments. Their synovial membrane is noticed above, as occupying the interspaces of these bones. d. Of the Tarsal and Metatarsal Bones. Between the inner cuneiform bone and the base of the first metatarsal bone, a distinct synovial membrane is commonly found. Another and separate synovial membrane includes the articular surfaces of the second metatarsal hone, and the ossa cuneiformia. A third synovial membrane is found be- tween the articular surfaces of the third cuneiform, and third metatarsal bone : and the articular surfaces of the third and fourth metatarsal bones are enclosed in a common capsule, which contains likewise the anterior surface of the os cuboides. The ligaments which unite the metatarsal bones to those of the tarsus, consist of irregular bands, both on the upper and under surface, called dorsal and plantar: the latter of these are very strong, particularly those by which the base of the second metatarsal bone is connected with the inner cuneiform. The ligaments connecting the metatarsal bones to each other, the articulations between the metatarsal bones and those of the first phalanx, and the articulations between the bones of the toes, so nearly resemble the corresponding arti- culations in the hand, that it is not considered necessary to particularize their structure.

428 Sect. VI. two kinds—the one common to it and other parts. They are : the sterno-thyroidei, thyreo-hyoidei, and constrict, pharyng. inferiores ; together with those attached to the os hyoides, the movements of which are communicated to the larynx especially. The others proper to it are situated in what may he called the— Laryngeal Region. They arc:— 1. M. Crico-arytjenoideus Posticus. Situation. On the back of the cricoid cartilage. Origin. Fleshy from the posterior broad portion of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion. Into the back part of the base of the arytaenoid cartilage. Use. To open the rima glottidis, and to tighten the chordae vocales. 2. M. Crioo-arytjenoideus Lateralis. Situation. Covered partially by the ala of the thyroid carti- lage, which must be removed to show it distinctly. Origin. Fleshy from the side of the cricoid cartilage, con- cealed in a great measure by the thyroid cartilage. Insertion. Into the side of the base of the arytaenoid cartilage. Use. To open the rima by pulling the vocal chords apart. \ 3. M. Thyreo-aryt;enoidkus. Situation. Covered by the thyroid cartilage. Origin. From the middle of the internal surface of the thyroid cartilage. Insertion. Into the arytaenoid cartilage above the former muscle. Use. To loosen the vocal chords by drawing the arytaenoid cartilages forwards towards the thyroid. 4. M. Aryt^noideus Obliquus. * Situation. Extending from one arytaenoid cartilage to the other. Origin. From the base of one arytaenoid cartilage, and crosses its fellow. Insertion. Into the tip of the other arytaenoid cartilage. Use. To pull the arytaenoid cartilages towards each other. One or the other of these is frequently found wanting. 5. M. Arytjenoideus Transversus. Situation. A single muscle running across from one arytaenoid cartilage to the other. Origin. From nearly the whole length of the side of one arytaenoid cartilage. Its fibres pass transversely.

91 Sect. II. 2. M. Posterior Medii. Origin. Double from the roots of the metacarpal bones that sustain the middle and ring fingers. Insertion. Into the inside of the tendinous expansion from the extensor digitorum communis, which runs along the pos- terior part of the middle finger. 3. M. Posterior Annularis. Origin. Double from the roots of the metacarpal bones that sustain the ring and little fingers. Insertion. Into the inside of the tendinous expansion of the extensor digitorum communis, which, runs along the pos- terior part of the ring finger. The Relative Situation of the Muscles in the Palm of the Hand. Having removed the skin and fat, the fascia palmaris will be seen, its middle portion covering the middle palmar region being the thickest; its outer covering the outer palmar re- gion the thinnest; and upon the inner portion are seen the fibres of the palmaris brevis. After dissecting off the fascia, In the first layer are seen, in the middle, the tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum manus, and along their outer edges and behind them the tendons of the flex. dig. prof, from the outer margins of which the lumbricales are passing towards the fingers: on the outside are seen the abductor pollicis, part of the flexor brevis poll, with the tendon of the flexor Iongus poll, lying upon it, and nearer the middle, part of the adductor pollicis : on the inside are seen the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti. In the second layer, having removed the abductor pollicis, the flexor tendons of the fingers, lumbricales, and the ab- ductor & flexor of the little finger, are seen, in the middle the adductor pollicis, and behind it, part of the abductor indicis; on the outer side the whole of the flexor brevis pollicis; and on the inside the adductor minimi digiti, and between it and the adductor poll, some of the interossei palmares are seen.

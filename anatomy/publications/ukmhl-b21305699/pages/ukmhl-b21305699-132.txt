10G Sect. II. h. Articulations between the Carpal and Meta- carpal Bones. These ligaments consist of slips, which run in various di- rections between the bones, and are strongest on the dor-al surface. They are so short as only to allow of a slight yielding motion. The ligamentous fibres of the first metacarpal bone are longer and stronger, extending from the trapezium upon it; and to this joint there is a peculiar synovial membrane. c. Articulations between the Metacarpal Bones. The four metacarpal bones, which support the fingers, have smooth articular surfaces at their posterior extremities, where they are in contact with each other, and processes of the com- mon synovial membrane of the carpus are generally extended to them. The ligaments of these bones are three, viz. :— 1 & 2. Anterior and Posterior. Situated at the posterior extremity, consisting of transverse fibres. 3. Anterior, or Interosseous. Situated at the anterior extremities or heads. They consist of transverse fibres, which are much stronger than the former, but are longer; and allow, therefore, of more motion. They are placed on the palmar side of the hand, and connect the heads of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers to each other. cl. Articulations of the Metacarpal Bones and Fingers, of the Bones of the Phalanges, and of the Bones of the Thumb. The capsules and ligaments of these joints do not differ from each other. They consist of capsules, formed by syno- vial membrane, which enclose the articular surfaces ; and lateral ligaments, situated at the sides of the joints, which adhere to and strengthen them. Practical Points.—Dislocations of the thumb. Amputation of,the fingers ; which requires a knowledge of the actual situation of the joint connected with external appearance.

Sect. V. 285 SECTION V. THE DISSECTION OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES. i CHAPTER 1.1 Preparatory Notices. The Vessels and Nerves may be examined for the most part at one time; and as the student has already gone through the dissection of the other parts according to the preceding sec- tions, he will be prepared to understand, without difficulty, their course and distribution, and will be enabled to recall and reimpress the knowledge of those parts' which have been already described. During this dissection then his attention must be directed to the distribution of the arteries, veins, and nerves. The absorbent vessels cannot be well examined with- out a particular mode of preparation, and must therefore be deferred; but the glands will present themselves in the coui’se of the dissection, and should be attended to. The dissection will proceed in the following order: 1. The Extremities, singly, with the arteries injected, for the dissection of the arteries, veins, nerves, and absorbent glands. 2. The Head, Neck, and Thorax, with the arteries injected, for the dissection of the arteries, veins, and absorbent glands. It would be inconvenient, if not imprac- ticable, to dissect the nerves of the head and neck at the same time’: therefore, for their particular examination, they may be dissected separately. The principal nerves may, however, be displayed.

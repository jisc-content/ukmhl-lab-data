Sect. IV. 262 CHAPTER HI. Of the Organs of Generation in the Male. ยง 1. OF THE PARTS EXTERIOR TO THE PELVIS. Scrotum. Contains the testicles. It is formed by a continuation of the common integuments. A line, termed raphe, extending from the under part of the penis longitudinally backwards over the middle of its surface, to the perineum, divides it into two equal parts. Beneath the skin a muscle has been described by some anatomists, called Dart os. The inner surface of the scrotum is lined with reticular membrane, which serves to connect it with the covering of the testicles. It is long and loose in its structure, so as to allow of free and considerable motion. Opposite to the raphe it is condensed, so as to form a septum between the sides of the scrotum and the testicles. Tunica Vaginalis. Is a serous membrane which gives a double covering to the testicle, having the loose cellular membrane of the scrotum attached to its ex- terior. Originally produced by the peritonaeum, it subse- quently forms a shut sack, or circumscribed cavity, which is disposed with respect to the testicle as the pericardium is with respect to the heart, a disposition which it has in com- mon with other reflected membranes ; it gives the testicle a close covering, and is then reflected, so as to give it a second or loose covering. In its structure it resembles the perito- naeum, externally cellular, and connected with the adjacent parts; internally smooth and unconnected, and its surface lubricated by a secretion, which preserves the mobility of the parts, and protects the testicle from pressure. On cutting open the reflected portion the position of the testicle is seen. It is placed obliquely, the upper part pro- jecting forwards, and the part called the epididymis at the outer and back part. The left testicle is situated lower than

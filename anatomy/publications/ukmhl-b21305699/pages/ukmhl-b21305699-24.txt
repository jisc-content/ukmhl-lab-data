xviii INTRODUCTION. immediate functions of the surgeon, do the organs of gene- ration, both in the male and female, demand attention : they are extensively connected with diseases, the treatment of which involves a variety of operations, from the simplest to, the most complicated; but all requiring an intimate know- ledge of their structure and relative position, and all inti- mately concerning the health and safety of the patient. We have omitted no opportunity of attracting the attention to relative position. But important as this is iri all parts, it is of especial importance in dissecting the arteries. In the following work, therefore, we have enumerated the parts in the neighbourhood of which they take their course, and shown their situation with respect to these parts. Thus the student will be enabled to notice where compression may be easily employed; to seek the points where they run over bone, where deeply embedded betwixt muscles, or where they are superficially placed. He will likewise attend to their chief anastomoses, so that he may duly estimate the power of pre- serving life in a part, by their enlargement, when the prin- cipal trunk supplying it has become obliterated. The im- portance of familiarizing the mind and eye with their situa- tion in the planning and executing of operations, and the utility of a previous acquaintance with the accidents to which they are liable, together with the ready way of detecting them, must be obvious : for, without a previous knowledge of the exact position of the arteries, the obscurity occasioned by the haemorrhage at the time of their injury, renders their discovery doubly perplexing. It scarcely need be added, that the larger branches are those which particularly claim atten- tion ; for, however by the dissection of the minute ramifica- tions, the 'industry of the student may be displayed, or by learning their names by rote, he may astonish those who delight rather in the semblance than the reality of knowledge, yet, beyond their contingent advantages in aiding the ac- quirement of decision and dexterity in operation, they are rather to be deprecated than recommended.

Sect. II. 1-13 It passes from the fore part of tlie os calcis to the outside of the os naviculare. 2. Inferior or Inner Plantar Ligament, Li- st amentum informs. This very strong ligament passes from the under and fore part of the os calcis to the under part of the os naviculare. Ligaments between the Os Calcis and Os Cuboides, Ligamenta calcaneo-cuboiclea ; viz. 1. Superior or Dorsal. It consists usually of several hands, which pass between the upper edges of the bones. 2. External. Is extended on the outside be- tween these bones. 3. Inferior or Outer Plantar. Is the strongest of the tarsal ligaments. It passes at the under surface of the bones. Ligaments between the Os Naviculare and the Os Cuboides, Ligamenta scaphoideo-cuboidea ; viz. 1. Interosseous Ligaments. A band of short transverse fibres which passes in the space between the bones. 2. Superior or Dorsal Ligament. Passes from the outer edge of the os naviculare to the upper surface of the os cuboides. 3. Inferior or Plantar Ligament. From the under part of the os naviculare to the inner edge of the os cuboides. c. Of the Second Row of Tarsal Bones. Ligaments between the Os Naviculare and the three Ossa Cuneiformia, Ligamenta scaphoideo-cunei- forrmia. The bones are connected by ligamentous bands, both above and below, passing irregularly from the os navicu- lare to each of the bones. They are severally distinguished, as the plantar and dorsal ligaments. Besides these there is a synovial capsule, between the os naviculare and the ossa cuuei- formia which penetrates tlie interspaces of the three latter bones.

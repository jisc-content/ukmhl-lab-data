Sect. II. 89 Use. To draw the fore finger outwards. c. Inner Palmar, containing four muscles, of which 1. M. Palmaris Brevis, Plas been already described. (See page 80.) The re- maining three belong to and form the ball of the little fingex*, being placed to the inner side of the tendon of the long flexor of the fingers. 2. M. Abductor Minimi Digiti. Situation. On the inner part of the hand. Origin. From the os pisiforme and ligamentum carpi annulare. ' Insertion. Tendinous into the inner side of the root of the first phalanx of the little finger. Use. To draw the little finger from the others. 3. M. Flexor Proprius Minimi Digiti. Situation. In front of the metacarpal bone and to the outer side of the last muscle.' Origin. From the hook-like process of the os unciforme and adjacent part of the annular ligament. Insertion. Tendinous into the inner part of the root of the first phalanx of this finger. This muscle is frequently wanting. Use. To bend the little finger. 4. M. Adductor Minimi Digiti. Situation. Covered almost entirely by the last muscle. Origin. Fleshy from the edge of the hook-like process of the os unciforme, and from that part of the annular ligament near to it. Insertion. Tendinous into the whole length of the inner and anterior part of the metacarpal bone which supports this finger. Use. To bring the little finger towards the others. d. Interosseal. There is a set of small muscles, which occupy the spaces between the metacarpal bones, and are called M. Interossei; they arise from the sides of the metacarpal bones, and are inserted tendinous, partly into the first joints of the fingers, and partly intermixed with the tendinous expansions of the extensor digitorum communis. They are divided into the internal and external, but all extend the first joints of the

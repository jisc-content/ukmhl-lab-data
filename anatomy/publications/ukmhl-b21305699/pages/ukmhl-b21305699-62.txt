Sect. I. - V CHAPTER V. Of the Head. The bones of the Head, caput, are twenty-two in number, and are usually divided into those of the skull, cranium, and face, facies; some of them are in pairs, but others are only single bones. To the Skull there are two pairs and two single bones j viz. 2 Ossa parietalia. 2 Ossa temporum. 1 Os frontis. 1 Os occipitis. To the Skull and Face two single bones are common ; viz. 1 Os ethmoides. 1 Os sphenoides. To the Face there are six pairs and two single hones â€¢ viz. 2 Ossa malarum. 2 Ossa maxillaria superiora. 2 Ossa nasi. 2 Ossa lachrymalia. 2 Ossa palatina. 2 Ossa turbinata. 1 Vomer. 1 Os Maxillare inferius. All these bones, with the exception of the ossa temporum and os maxillare inferius which form a ginglymoid, or hinge joint, are united by that species of synakthhosis, which is called suture, from its resemblance to the stitches of a seam. And here would seem to be the proper place to describe the sutures, but as they cannot be well explained, till the pro- cesses of the different bones of the head have been spoken of, it has been deemed best to defer the description of them, till the student have obtained a perfect knowledge of the sepa- rate bones of the skull and face.

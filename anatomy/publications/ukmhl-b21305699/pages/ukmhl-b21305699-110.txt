84 Sect. II. ulna, and crossed by the two last-mentioned muscles; it is named from its figure. Origin. Broad, tendinous and fleshy, from the inner and fore part of the lower portion of the ulna. Its fibres pass transversely. Insertion. Into the fore and outer part of the opposite por- tion of the radius. , Use. To render the hand prone. c. Posterior Superficial Antibkaciiial, containing three muscles. 1. M. Anconeus. Situatioji. Immediately ''below the outer edge of the olechranon, of a triangular figure, and covered by a strong aponeurosis, which separates it from the extensors of the hand. Origin. Tendinous from the posterior part of the outer condyle of the os humeri. It passes downward and inward, and spreads in its descent. The upper edge is commonly connected with the triceps. Insertion. Broad and fleshy into the ridge on the outer and back part of the ulna, below the olechranon. Use. To extend the fore arm. 2. M. Extensor Carpi Ulnaius. Situation. Immediately to the outer side of the anconeus above, and laying upon the whole length of the ulna below. Origin. Tendinous from the outer condyle of the os hu- meri, descends along the outer surface of the ulna, and receives from it additional fibres. It terminates in a strong tendon, which passes under the dorsal ligament of the wrist, and over the hand. Insertion. Into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone which supports the little finger. Use. To extend the hand inwards. 3. M. Extensor Communis Digitorum. Situation. To the outer side of the last muscle. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the outer condyle of the os humeri, where it adheres to the supinator brevis. About the middle of the arm it divides into four fleshy bellies, which terminate in'an equal number of long flattened tendons. These pass under the dorsal ligament of the wrist upon the back of the hand, where they become broader and thinner, and are connected by oblique tendinous bands.

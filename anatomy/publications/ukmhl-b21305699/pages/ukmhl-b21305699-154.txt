128 Sect. II. min. dig., tendon of the flex. long. poll, and abductor poll, having been removed, in the middle is seen the flexor ac- cessorius with its insertion into the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum and the origins of the lumbricales from the tendons of the same muscle : on the outside, the whole of the flexor brev. min. dig.; on the inside more of the flex brev. poll. In the third layer, the flexor accessorius and tendons of the flex. long, dig., and lumbricales having been removed, in the middle is seen the adductor pollicis, and along the heads of the metatarsal bones the transversalis pedis : on the outside some of the interossei pedis plantares; and on the inside the Avhole of the flexor brev. poll., and posteriorly the insertion of the tibialis anticus & posticus, and after open- ing its sheath, the tendon of the peroneus longus. § TABLE EXHIBITING THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY: Those, namely, by which the movements of the Femur, Leg, Foot, Tarsus, and Toes, are performed. For some general observations, see p. 92. The Motions of the Femur upon the pelvis are those of extension, or carrying it backward—-flexion, or car- rying it forwards—abduction, or carrying it outwards, as in separating the thighs—adduction, or carrying it inwards, as in approximating the thighs—rotation, or turning it upon its axis, either inwards or outwards. The muscles have, there- fore, been divided into—a. Extensors, b. Flexors, c. Ab- ductors, d. Adductors, e. Rotators inward, /. Rotators outward. a. Extensors : 1. Gluteus maximus. 2. Gluteus medius (part of.) 3. Pyriformis. 4. Obturator interims. 5. Gemini. 6. Quadratus. 7. Adductor rnagnus (portion from the tuber ischii.) 8. Biceps (long head of.) 9. Semi-membranosus. 10. Semi-tendinosus.

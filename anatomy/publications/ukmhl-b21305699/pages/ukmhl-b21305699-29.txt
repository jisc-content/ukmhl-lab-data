Sect. I. 3 Before proceeding with the description of the Bones, it will be necessary to speak of THE TERMS generally used in describing relative jwsition, or the relation which one part bears to another. The anatomist supposes the body erect, with the arms in such a position that the palms of the hands are turned forwards, and the lower extremities so placed, that the knees and toes shall be directly in front. The terms, by which relative position is usually denoted, with their several senses, are as follows. By superior and inferior, we signify higher and lower with respect to the summit of the head; by an- terior and posterior, we denote the situation of the parts as nearer to the fore or the hinder surface of the "body ; and by laterally to the right or left, we understand that the parts so described approach the one side or the other. Inner and outer express the relation of any given part or portion of the body to an imaginary plane, assumed by ana- tomists for the purpose of distinct conception or description, and named by them the Median plane, it being supposed to bisect the body into lateral halves, passing through the middle of the head and trunk, and continued between the inferior extremities : inner denotes an approach to, outer a removal from this imaginary plane. The terms external and internal, without and within, are used only in speaking of cavities. n 2

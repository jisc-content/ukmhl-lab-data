Sect. III. 207 The coronary veins accompany the arteries. The greater number uniting form a considerable trunk, which passes be- tween the left auricle and ventricle, and terminates as has been already described, at the under part of the right auricle. There is generally a smaller vein, which runs upon the right ventricle, and terminates in the appendix of the auricle. Be- sides these, the blood is supposed to find its way into the ca- vities of the heart from the blood vessels by orifices, which are called the foramina Thebesii. Their existence has been supposed to be established by the fact, that fluids injected into the coronary vessels are frequently found to make their way into the cavities of the heart. ; ยง 3. OF THE MUSCLES PARTICULARLY CON- NECTED WITH THE RIBS, DISTRIBUTED INTO REGIONS, viz.: a. Intercostal Region, containing five muscles. 1. M. Intercostales Externi. Situation. Between the ribs externally. Origin. From the under edge of each rib, excepting the twelfth.; from the spine to the junction of the ribs with their cartilages. From these to the sternum they are discontinued, and their place occupied by an aponeurosis. They pass obliquely downward and forward. Insertion. Into the upper edge of each rib, immediately below that from which they arise. Use. To raise the ribs. 2. M. Intercostales Interni. Their mode of origin and insertion is the same as that of the intercostales externi; but they begin at the sternum, run obliquely downwards and backwards, decussating with the externi, and are continued only as far as the angle of the ribs. They are situated within the thorax. Use. To raise the ribs. 3. M. Levatores Costarum. Are portions of the intercostales externi, which arise from the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and terminate in the ribs immediately below. Use. Implied in the name. - ' l 4. M. Depressores Costarum. Are portions of the intcrcostales interni, which at the lower

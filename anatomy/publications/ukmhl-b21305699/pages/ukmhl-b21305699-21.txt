xv INTRODUCTION. ing unnatural conformation or figure, whether arising from disease or injury. An extensive opportunity of enlarging his comparative views, and one which should be cultivated by every means, is afforded in the dissecting-room by the inspec- tion of bodies, and thus of learning to discriminate between the appearances of health and disease, and of ascertaining the changes which disordered functions or morbid actions pro- duce in the form, colour, and texture of organs. Of the advantages which result from such observations to our know- ledge of the causes, signs, seats, and treatment of disease, it is not here the place to treat. These then are the chief benefits which are to be expected from dissection; and whilst the lectures give a comprehen- sive view of the subject, with the mutual relation and con- nection of all its parts, and their application to practice, it is by dissection alone that such views become essentially our own, or that we dare give them the name of knowledge. After having fixed the objects of inquiry, the next import- ant and necessary step in the advancement of knowledge, is to determine the method of investigation. To this end the fol- lowing considerations are recommended to the attention of the beginner :—He must depend for success entirely on his own exertions ; and guard against the common error of supposing that his acquirements will be proportionate to the lessons of his teachers, if he give even attentive ear to them, without activity of mind : for he must recollect that the mind is by no means passive in the acquirement of knowledge, and that, to use the common but apt metaphor, before we have digested what is presented to our perception, we can on no account call it experience.—Every mind has something individual in its mode of receiving instruction, and of stamping form upon it. That which is presented to the mind, must be rendered consonant with it, assimilated, or in other words, reduced to principle, before it can become an understood fact, or a fit maxim for conduct or judgment. In the eagerness for know- ledge, he must be careful not to overburthen the mind, by

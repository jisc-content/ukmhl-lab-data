» The present edition is, for the most part, a reprint of Mr. Green’s ee Dissector’s Manual,” published in 1820. It dif- fers, however, in having a description of the Bones ; without a knowledge of which, the anatomical student will always find himself perplexed in endeavouring to obtain an acquaint- ance with the attachments of muscles. The directions' for the best mode of displaying the different parts, have been enlarged, and the relative situation of the muscles, with their uses, described sufficiently to enable the student to find them with greater facility. Some portions of the section on relative situation have been introduced into the body of the work, with the exception of which, that part has been withdrawn ; it being intended at an early opportunity to make another volume, specially appropriated to the dissection of parts in their relative position. 34j'^Stamford Street, Oct. l/l825.

Sect. II. 115 c. Inner Crural, containing six muscles. 1. M. Pectineus, Pectinalis. Situation. Immediately below the body of the os pubis, and covered partially by the sheath containing the femoral vessels. Origin. Broad, thin, and fleshy, from the fore part of the body of the os pubis, above the obturator foramen, and passes somewhat obliquely downwards. Insertion. By a flat, short tendon into the fore and upper part of the linea aspera. Use. To bring the thigh upwards and inwards, and rotate it outwards. 2. M. Gracilis. Situation. On the inside of the whole length of the thigh. Origin. By a thin tendon from the os pubis, near to the symphysis. It forms a slender, flat muscle, which descends on the inner side of the thigh. Insertion. Tendinous, into the inner and upper part of the tibia, below and behind the sartorius. Use. To draw the thigh inwards across the other. M. Triceps Adductor Fkmoris. Under this term are often comprehended three muscles in this region, which are found on the inside of the thigh, behind the pectineus above, and the vastus interims below, and more properly dis- tinguished as 3. M. Adductor Longus Femoris. Situation. Most anterior of the three. Origin. By a strong round tendon from the upper and fore part of the os pubis, and from the fore part of the sym- physis of that bone, passes obliquely downwards and out- wards, and spreads in its descent. Insertion. Tendinous into the back part of the linea aspera, about its middle, and is continued someway down. 4. M. Adductor Brevis Femoris. Situation. Above and.behind the former. Origin. By a short tendon, immediately below and behind the former, from the fore part of the os pubis, near the sym- physis pubis. It passes downwards and outwards. Insertion. Tendinous into the back part of the root of the trochanter minor, and into the upper third of the linea aspera. It is connected, more or less, with the pectineus and the adductor magnus. i 2

TABLE EXHIBITING THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES WHICH PRODUCE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE THORAX, OF THE HEAD, AND OF THE VERTEBRAE. I. Motions of the Thorax. They are those which take place during respiration. They consist of the motions in inspiration, by which the chest is enlarged in all its dimensions, and by means of which the lungs are filled with air; these are produced by the elevation of the ribs and the descent of the diaphragm : and of the motions of exspiration, by which the chest is contracted in all its dimensions, and by means of which the air is again expelled from the lungs ; these are produced by the depression of the ribs and the ascent of the diaphragm. The muscles may therefore be arranged, as—a. Muscles of Inspiration, and b. Muscles of Exspi- ration. It is to be observed, however, that the diaphragm is the principal agent -both of inspiration and exspiration, and in unconstrained breathing is but feebly assisted by the mus- cles which move the ribs not excepting even the intercostales. When respiration is carried on with some effort, the inter- costal muscles are more exerted ; but it is only in laborious breathing that the numerous other muscles attached to the ribs are called into action.

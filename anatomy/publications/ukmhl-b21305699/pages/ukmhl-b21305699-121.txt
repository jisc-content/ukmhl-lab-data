95 Sect. II. b. Extensors. ]. Triceps. 2. Anconeus. The Motions of the Radius upon the ulna, by which the palm of the hand is turned forwards, or made supine, or turned backwards, or rendered prone, are called supination and pronation; and the muscles concerned in these motions are, therefore, divided into—a. Supinators, and b. Pronators. a. Supinators. 1. Biceps. 2. Supinator brevis. 3. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. 4. Extensor primi internodii pollicis. 5. Supinator longus. N. B.—This last muscle is perhaps not so properly named Supinator; as it appears rather calculated to bring the radius to a mid-state between pronation and supination, and, when in that state, to inflect it upon the humerus. b. Pronators. 1. Pronator teres. 2. Pronator quadratus. 3. Flexor carpi radialis. The Motions of the Hand upon the fore arm consist of inflexions forward or flexion: inflexion backwards, or extension: inflexion outward, or abduction: inflexion inward, or adduction. The muscles, therefore, may be divided into—a. Flexors, b. Extensors, c. Abductors, d. Adduc- tors. a. Flexors. 1. Flexor carpi radialis. 2. Flexor carpi ulnaris. 3. Palmaris longus. - 4. Flexor digitorum stiblimis. 5. Flexor digitorum profundis. G. Flexor longus pollicis.

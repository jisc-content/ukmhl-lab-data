277 Sect. IV. CHAPTER III. Of the Organs of Generation in the Female. § 1. OF THE PARTS EXTERIOR TO THE PELVIS, The female organs of generation are divided into those parts ■which are placed externally, and are seen without dissection, and into the internal parts which require dissection for their examination, comprehending the Vagina, the Uterus, and its Appendages. External Parts. Are hounded, anteriorly, by the pro- jection covered with hair, which is called the mons veneris. Below this, and continued backwards, is the Jissura magna, formed by the most projecting of the external parts, the labia, which are thick before where continued with the mons, under which they are joined by an anterior commissure, but thinner behind where they are united by a transverse fold of the skin, called the posterior commissure freeman, or furcula. The fissure terminates behind at the distance of about an inch from the anus : this short space is called the perineum, and there is a slight indication of a raphe upon it. On separating the labia, are seen—1. The Clitoris, a small body more or less projecting, behind the anterior commissure of the labia, and below the symphysis pubis.—2. The Nymphce, two folds which begin at the clitoris, and separating from each other, are lost upon the internal surfaces of the labia.—3. The Fes- tibulum, a triangular, slightly excavated surface, bounded at the sides by the nymphae, and above by the clitoris.—4. The Meatus urinarius, more properly the orijicium urethrae, which is about an inch distant from the clitoris.—5. The Orifice of the vagina, furnished with the hymen, or caruncu- Ice rnyrtiformes.—6. Between this opening and the posterior commissure, a slight transverse depression called the Fossa Navicularis. / Clitoris. It is situated between the upper parts of the labia, beyond which it seldom projects, its body rarely

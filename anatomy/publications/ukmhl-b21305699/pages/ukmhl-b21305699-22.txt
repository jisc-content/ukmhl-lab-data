He should have a general conception of parts before he proceed to their particular examination; he should not therefore attempt to dissect those parts which he has not seen displayed in the lectures or demonstrations. If invention were a quality frequently to be met wTith, such a rule might be dispensed with ; but, fortunately or unfortunately, man is the creature of imitation and education ; he may therefore lose his time, from groping in the dark, when he might have carried a light to the inquiry; and from his attempts having been repeatedly foiled, he may become tired and disgusted with his employment. A general idea is to the young ana- tomist what a map is to a traveller in a strange country. But the student, who should indiscriminately direct his attention to all the parts which are successively treated of in lectures or in books on anatomy, misled by the necessity under which the writer or lecturer lies of describing all parts, and almost with equal minuteness, will find, from insufficiency of time, that notwithstanding all the efforts he may have used, he is deficient in points which are essential in practice, whilst he has gained others for which he has no application. There is necessarily a choice of subjects to be made, as well as a plan to be pursued in their investigation : and although it is not meant that there are any parts of the body which are un- worthy consideration, yet it is recommended that the leading points should be first mastered ; and that afterwards, as time and opportunity may permit, the less important should be added. Thu3 the student should commence with the bones: they groxind, and in part predetermine, the scheme of relative position ; they form a framework to all the softer parts ; and in giving them figure and support, constitute the form of the body. From their unyielding texture, they may be readily ’ distinguished by ’the touch, although hidden to the sight when surrounded by the softer parts ", they therefore serve as

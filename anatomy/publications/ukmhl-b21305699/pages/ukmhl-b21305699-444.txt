418 Sect. VI. CHAPTER TII. Of the Nose, and Parts connected with it. § 1. OF THE NOSE. The Nose is divided into an external prominent part, and an internal formed of two cavities. External Part. Is of a pyramidal figure.—On its outside we distinguish :—the radix, or upper part; the dorsum, or middle prominence ; the apex, or point; the alee, or lateral movable parts; the columna, or under part of the partition next the upper lip, which separates two openings, called the nostrils, leading to the internal cavities, about which are some small hairs, called vibrisscc. It is composed superiorly of bone, and inferiorly of cartilage. It has a par- tial covering of muscle, and a general one from the common integuments. It is lined by a mucous membrane. Cartilages. Are one large single one which assists in forming the septum of the nose, and four smaller ones situated at its sides, viz. 1. Cartilage of the Septum. Is the middle and most considerable cartilage; of a somewhat triangular figure. Its base or superior edge is joined to the anterior edge of the nasal lamella of the ethmoid bone. The inferior edge is received within the two edges of the vomer. The anterior edge forms the dorsum of the nose, and is united with the lateral cartilages. It is very thick above, but be- comes gradually thinner as it descends, and terminates by a short rounded edge, which projects between the cartilages of the alie. 2 & 3. Lateral Cartilages. Are two in num- ber, extending from the middle cartilage. They are placed somewhat obliquely at the side of the nose, and are connected by short ligamentous fibres to the edge of the nasal bones and

Sect. IL 107 CHAPTER HE Of the Muscles of the Lower Extremity. It is unnecessary to repeat here the observations with which the dissection of the Upper Extremity was introduced. They may, however, be easily referred to, Chap. I. of this section, should the Lower Extremity be dissected first. The muscles of the Lower Extremity are distributed into Regions about the Pelvis, on the Thigh, the Leg, and the Foot. * ยง 1. REGIONS ABOUT THE PELVIS. i Of these the Lumbar and Pelvic, which are contained within the abdominal and pelvic cavities, cannot be dissected till the abdominal muscles and viscera have been removed: aud if that be not done, it will be more convenient to begin with the dissection of the regions on the thigh, (see p. 112,) and afterwards continue with those of the pelvis as soon as oppor- tunity will allow. a. Lumbar, containing three muscles. 1. M. Quadratus Lumborum. Situation. Between the last rib, the crista of the ilium, and the vertebrae, and behind the kidney. Origin. Broad tendinous and fleshy, from the posterior part of the spine of the os ilii. Insertion. Into the transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae, into the last rib near the spine, and by a small tendon into the side of the last dorsal vertebra. Use. To move the loins to one side; to pull down the last rib j and when both muscles act, to bend the loins forwards. 2. M. Psoas Magnus. Situation. Close to the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, and extending along the brim of the pelvis : it is a considerable muscle.

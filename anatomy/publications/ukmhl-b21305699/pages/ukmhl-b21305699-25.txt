xix INTRODUCTION. Less obvious, but scarcely less important, is the claim which the Nerves have on the'student’s attention, not only that they may be preserved from injury and avoided by the knife ; but likewise because, by examining their distribution, we gain more accurate notions of disease, of the possible relations between distant parts, and the general harmony of the animal economy. These, therefore, are the parts which have been investigated in the present work as systems, or traced throughout the body:—they are the elements, as it were, of anatomical knowledge. But, these being known, another mode of inquiry presents itself, that of examining the blending and interlacement of these parts together, as they are entering into the composition of the different portions of the body. It is from understanding this grouping of parts, that we are enabled to plan and foresee all the steps of an operation, or note the reasons why it may not be undertaken; whereas, without this investigation of them as a whole, our acquaintance with the individual and insulated systems can neither give us confidence, nor the knowledge essential to the practice of surgery. We recommend the student to gain a perfect knowledge of the Bones; and then, in prosecuting dissection, to pursue the order laid down in this work. At the same time he must bear in mind, that, in some instances, the descriptions are more minute than the importance of the subject demands, from the Author’s wish to make the work more complete for reference; but with the general directions already given, we presume, that the details will not abstract the attention from the leading points. We should also advise the student to provide himself with some preparations, for the purpose of keeping up his anato- mical knowledge. They should consist, at least, of a set of separate bones; and, if possible, of a skeleton; of an upper and a lower extremity, and of a head and neck, in the adult, injected to show the blood-vessels; side-views of the male

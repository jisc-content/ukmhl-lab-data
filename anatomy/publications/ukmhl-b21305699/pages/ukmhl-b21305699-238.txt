On the side of the neck, to the outer side of the complexus. Origin. From the transverse processes of the five under- most cervical, and of the three uppermost dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Tendinous into the back part of the mastoid process. Use. To assist the complexus in pulling the head aside. 4. M. Transversalis Colli. Situation. On the side of the neck and to the outer edge of the last muscle, with which it is closely connected. Ori gin. From the transverse processes of the five upper- most dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebrae, except the first and last. Use. To turn the head obliquely backwards. c. Deep Cervico-occipital Region, containing four mus- cles, which are covered by the complexus. 1. M. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major. Situation. Upon the back of the arch of the first vertebra. Origin. From the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra, and passes obliquely upwards and outwards, grow- ing broader in its ascent. Insertion. Into the os occipitis. Use. To pull the head backwards. 2. M. Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor. Situation. Covered by the former. Origin. From the protuberance, which answers to a spinous process on the first cervical vertebra. Insertion. Under the former into the os occipitis near the foramen magnum. Use. To assist the action of the last muscle. 3. M. Obliquus Capitis Superior. Situation. Above the rectus major, nearly transversely. Origin. From the transverse process of the first cervical vertebra. Insertion. Into the os occipitis, behind the mastoid pro-

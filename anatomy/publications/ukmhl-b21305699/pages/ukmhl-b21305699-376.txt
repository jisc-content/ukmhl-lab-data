350 Sect. V. saphjena. V. saphama major. It arises from the femoral, a little below Poupartâ€™s ligament, and passes through the opening of the fascia of the thigh. It descends then between the aponeurosis and skin along the inner side of the thigh; detaching some branches to the parts of generation, some which ascend between the skin and muscles of the abdomen, and a branch which passes down a little before it and distri- butes branches to the fore part of the thigh; this branch anastomoses with the saphaena near the inner condyle, or is continued sometimes down the leg. The saphaena is con- tinued from the thigh behind the inner condyle, takes its course obliquely along the inner and fore part of the leg, passes then before the inner malleolus upon the dorsum of the foot, and spreads into branches, which reach as far as the toes, and form, by anastomosing, an intricate plexus. Popliteal Vein. V. poplitea. Descends behind the popliteal artery, and after furnishing branches which accompany the divisions of that artery, divides into Anterior and Posterior Tidial Veins : and, as in the upper extremity, each artery is accompanied by two veins, which accompany, and are distributed like, the corresponding arteries. It gives off also the second subcutaneous branch : the lesser sAPHiENA. V. saphama minor. Arises in the hol- low of the ham. It descends nearly vertically with the com- municating tibial nerve, and descends between the gastrocne- mius and skin in the depression between the heads of that muscle; then continues its course along the edge of the tendo Achillis, passes behind the outer malleolus, and divides into numerous branches, which extend along the upper and outer part of the foot, and anastomose with branches of the saphama major.

Sect. IV. 227 SECTION IV. THE DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. CHAPTER I. Of the Muscles of the Abdomen, and of the Parts of Inguinal and Femoral Hernia. § 1. OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE ABDOMEN. Immediately beneath the common integuments of the Abdo- men is found a strong layer of condensed cellular membrane, •which has been called the Fascia Superficialis, or aponeu- rosis of the external oblique muscle; it does not differ from the cellular texture which connects the skin to the subjacent parts in the other regions of the body, except in its greater density ;'but it is of importance in liernise, and should there * fore be particularly attended to, and not dissected off with the skin, as is usual in other parts. Behind it are found, in the Abdominal Region, five pairs of muscles. I 1. M. Obliquus Externus Abdominis, descenclens. Situation. Its muscular portion covers the lateral parts, and its tendinous portion is expanded over the front of the abdomen. It forms the first layer. For the purpose of dissecting it, an incision should be carried from the cartilago ensiformis to the os pubis, and a second obliquely downwards and forwards in the course of the fibres, from the margin of the ribs to the first incision. 42

Sect III. 194 CHAPTER III. Of the Thorax. ยง 1. OF PARTS EXTERIOR. Of the muscles belonging to this division, a part have been already presented in the course of dissection adopted, (see p. 71 j) and others will be described in the place most con- venient for their examination. We commence then with the Mamma. Mamma. Is a gland peculiar to the female, of a rounded form, situated on the anterior, and a little towards the lateral part of the thorax; it adheres loosely, by cellular substance, to the surface of the large pectoral muscle, in part to the serratus magnus, extends as far as the axilla. It is of a flattened oval figure, and of a whitish colour. It is formed of numerous small lobes, united by a dense cellular texture, but the lobes are often not so much agglomerated towards the circumference : and these lobuli are again composed of smaller glandular masses. Its excretory ducts, called the .lactiferous tubes, arise by minute radicles from all these glandular masses : they gradually unite into larger canals or trunks, run in a radiated manner towards the root of the nipple, and lastly form from twelve to eighteen larger tubes terminating at the nipple, ov papilla. This is situated near the centre of the mamma. It is of a cylindrical form, of a redder colour than the rest of the skin of the breast; and composed of the elastic tough cellular substance, which en- closes the lactiferous tubes. These are at a little distance from each other, and are coiled up ; but when the nipple is drawn out and extended, the ducts become straight and parallel to each other. There is no communication between the lactiferous tubes, and sometimes one or more of them termi- nate upon the surface of the areola. Upon the apex of the nipple the orifices of the lactiferous ducts appear, and are of the same number with those which enter the base. Around the nipple there is a circle, or disk, called areola,

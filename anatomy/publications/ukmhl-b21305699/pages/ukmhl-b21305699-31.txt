The vertebrae are divided into three classes, the cervical, of which there are seven, forming the neck; the dorsal, or those of the back, which are twelve in number; and the lum- bar, or those of the loins, consisting of five vertebrae. These three classes have remarkable general peculiarities, but they also differ from each other. The cervical vertebrae are smaller than the others, their bodies are longer from side to side ; the upper surface the largest, and concave laterally, the lower the smallest, and concave from behind forwards; articular pro- cesses oblique, the superior oval, slightly convex, facing up- wards and backwards; the inferior also oval, slightly concave, facing downwards and forwards; transvhi-se processes short and thin, passing directly outwards from the body, and from the roots of the articular processes, having a hole in each for the transmission of the vertebral artery, and bifurcated for the attachment of muscles ; spinous process short, horizontal and bifid : spinal hole large and triangular; its upper edge sharp, its lower edge larger than the upper, and slightly rounded : the notches at the roots of the articular processes not so large as in the other vertebrse. The dorsal vertebras diminish in size from the first to the fourth or fifth, from which they increase to the twelfth, which is the largest of all : the body is longer from before to behind, than from side to side, flat above and below, and the inferior surface the largest; at the junction of the body with the arch, a half articular surface on the upper and lower margin, these when the vertebrae are put together form an articular surface on each side, between every two dorsal vertebrae to receive the heads of the ribs : articular processes perpendicular and flat, the two superior facing backwards and outwards, the two inferior forwards and inwards : transverse processes strong, extending outwards and backwards, having a concave articular surface on the front of their points for the tubercles of the ribs : spinous process much hooked down- wards, triangular, and sharp above and behind, hollowed be- fore and below : spinal hole round, notches larger than in the cervical vertebra. The lumbar vertebras are of larger size than the

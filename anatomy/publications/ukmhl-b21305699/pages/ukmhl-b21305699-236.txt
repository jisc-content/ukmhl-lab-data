210 Sect. III. CHAPTER IV. Of the Muscles nearest to the Vertebral Column. Most of the muscles in the immediate neighbourhood of the vertebral column are placed on the posterior part of the trunk: but there are also some on the fore part of the neck, which however cannot be seen till the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachaea have been removed ; they form the a. Anterior Deep Cervical, containing four muscles. 1. M. Longus Colli. Situation. The innermost of the muscles in this region. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the bodies of the three superior vertebrae of the back laterally, and from the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae of the neck. Insertion. Into the fore part of the bodies of all the vertebrae of the neck, by as many tendinous and fleshy slips. Use. To bend the neck forwards and to one side; if both act, to bend it directly forwards. 2. Rectus Capitis Internus Major. Situation. To the outer side of the longus colli. Ongin. From the fore part of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae of the neck. Insertion. Into the cuneiform process of the os occipitis. Use. To bend the head forwards. 3. Rectus Capitis Internus Minor. Situation. Covered almost entirely by the last muscle. Origin. From the fore part of the body of the first ver- tebra of the neck. Insertion. Into the cuneiform process of the os occipitis, near the root of its condyloid process. Use, To bend the head forwards upon the first vertebra.

The inner and longer crura leave between them a long oval opening, hiatus aorticus, through which the aorta passes from the thorax into the abdomen. Above this opening the fasciculi of the crura on each side decussate in part, and again separate to form an oval aperture, foramen oesophageum, which is situated rather to the left, and through which the oesophagus is continued from the thorax into the abdomen.

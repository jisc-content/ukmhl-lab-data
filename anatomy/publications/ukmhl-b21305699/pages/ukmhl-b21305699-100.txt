74 Sect. II. 1. M. Levator Scapulje (levator anguli sca- pulae : muse, patientiae.) Situation. At the posterior and lateral part of the neck. Origin. By tendinous and fleshy slips from the transverse processes of the five uppermost cervical vertebrae, frequently from four, sometimes from three or two only. These slips unite to form a rounded muscle, which passes outward and downward. Insertion. Tendinous and fleshy into the superior angle and base above the spine of the scapula. Use. To pull up the angle of the scapula. 2. M. Rhomboideus Major. Situation. Between the scapula and spine; this and the following muscle are named from their figure. Origin. Tendinous from the spinous processes of the five superior vertebrae of the back; its fibres pass with a slight obliquity outwards. Insertion. Into that part of the base of the scapula which is below the spine. Use. To draw the scapula directly backwards. 3. M. Rhomboideus Minor. Situation. Immediately above the former, and sometimes not separated from it. Origin. Tendinous from the spinous processes of the three, or sometimes two inferior cervical vertebrae, and from the ligamentum nuchae. Insertion. Into that part of the base of the scapula which is opposite the origin of the spine. Use. Same as that of the last. ยง 2. ON THE SHOULDER. a. External Scapular, containing one muscle. 1. M. Deltoides. Situation. On the shoulder, producing its roundness ; it is strong and of a triangular shape, broad above, and placed to the outer side of the M. pect. maj.; and between the two mus- cles there is a space below the clavicle filled up by cellular membrane, through which the humeral thoracic artery and cephalic vein pass, and mark the division between the two mus- cles. To be dissected by making an incision from the acromion perpendicularly down the outside of the arm, about six inches

70 Sect. II. SECTION II. THE DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES AND JOINTS OF THE EXTREMITIES. CHAPTER I. Of the Muscles of the Upper Extremity. In the dissection of the Muscles, a knowledge of their boundaries, attachments, and actions, ought to be gained; and as they are especially fitted, and here are chosen, to initiate the student into the practical parts of anatomy, dex- terity in the use of the knife ought to be attained. The only instrument which for the most part will be found necessary, is the knife ; and, as skill in its use is essentially requisite in surgical operations, it ought to be preferred wherever it is found not absolutely inconvenient. The scissars are not required in the dissection of the muscles, and seldom in that of other parts ; and the fingers should be used instead of the forceps, both because they are better instruments, and because the free use of them cannot be too soon acquired. For the easy and complete dissection of a muscle, it should be first put upon the stretch, that is, its points of attachment should be separated from each other till it is rendered tense. Besides the necessity of so doing, in order to clean it, there is an advantage gained in learning how to extend a muscle, as it points out in what direction its action will be exerted in order to approximate the parts to which it is fixed. In the next place, a clean cut should be made through the coverings of the muscle, whether of skin or fascia, down to the muscular fibre; and the incision should be carried in the course of the

72 Sect. II. the cartilages of the ribs; it is less than the M. pect. maj., and of a triangular figure. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy, by three, or sometimes four heads from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs (more rarely from the sixth), near their cartilages. The fibres passing obliquely outwards and upwards, are collected into a short tendon. Insertion. Into the point of the coracoid process of the scapula. Use. To pull the scapula downward and forwards; if that be fixed, it raises the ribs. 3. M. Subclavius. Situation. Immediately under the clavicle. Origin. Tendinous from the cartilage of the first rib. It be- comes fleshy, and passes upward and outward under the clavicle. Insertion. Into the under surface of the clavicle from near its sternal extremity to a point opposite to the coracoid pro- cess of the scapula. Use. To pull the clavicle downwards. b. Lateral Thoracic, containing one muscle. 1. M. Serratus Magnus (serratusmajor anticus.) Situation. On the side of the chest, covered in a great degree by the scapula; the clavicle must be dislocated from the sternum, before the whole extent of the muscle can be seen; it is broad and thin. Origin. By fleshy digitations from the nine uppermost ribs. Its fibres are directed backwards, with different degrees of obliquity. Insertion. Fleshy into the whole length of the base of the scapula, between the attachments of the rhomboid and sub- scapular muscles, and especially about the inferior angle of the scapula. Use. To draw the scapula forwards and downw ards; and if that be fixed, to draw up the ribs. c. Dorso-lumbar, containing tw o muscles. 1. M. Trapezius. Situation. Broad and thin, on the upper part of the back and neck ; to be displayed by making an incision from the protuberance of the os occipitis perpendicularly down to the sacrum; and another transversely from the spine of the

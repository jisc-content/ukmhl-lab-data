Sect. IT. 141 rounded only by ligaments and tendons, the joint is so super- ficial that alterations in its form or motions are readily de- tected. The Ligaments connecting the bones of the leg with those of the tarsus, namely with the os calcis, the astragalus, and the os naviculare, are four; viz. 1. Deltoid Ligament of the tibia, Lig amentum tibice laterale internum deltoides. It arises from the malleolus interims, spreads as it descends, and is attached below to the astragalus, the os calcis, and the os naviculare. 2. Anterior Ligament of the fibula, Ligamen- tum fibulce anterius. Arises from the anterior part of the outer malleolus, and passing obliquely forwards and inwards, be- comes fixed to the fore and outer part of the astragalus. 3. Middle, or Perpendicular Ligament of the fibula, Ligamentum fibulce medium perpendiculare. Arises from the extremity of the outer malleolus, and after descending nearly perpendicularly, is fixed below to the outer side of the os calcis. 4. Posterior Ligament of the fibula, Liga- mentumfibulceposterius. It arises from the inner and back part of the outer malleolus, passes nearly transversely in- wards, and is attached to the back part of the astragalus. Besides these ligaments, the joint is further strengthened by ligamentous fibres, which extend upon the capsule from the tibia to the astragalus. The Synovial Membrane. Membrana articuli pedis synovialis. Arises from the margin of the articular surfaces of the tibia and fibula, and is attached to the circumference of the articular surfaces of the astragalus. Practical Points. Dislocations:—inward—out- ward—and forward. § 6. OF THE FOOT. Of the Tarsal Bones. The bones of the tarsus are firmly united to form the tarsal arch by strong ligaments situated between the bones on the dor- sal and plantar surfaces, and on the inner and outer side of the foot; which are distinguished by names designative of their situation and of the bones which they connect.

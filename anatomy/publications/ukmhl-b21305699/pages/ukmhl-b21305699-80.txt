Sect. I. 54 os sphenoides with the sphenoidal angle of the os parietale, and that edge of the os frontis which is found in the tem- poral fossa ; it passes across the skull from the anterior point of that sphenoidal angle of one os parietale, to the same part of the other, and in its course joins the upper edges of the orbitar plates, the transverso spinous, and ethmoidal pro- cesses of the os sphenoides, with the orbitar plates of the os frontis, and the crybriform plate of the os ethmoides ; and it is continued between the frontal, parietal, and temporal bones above, and the sphenoid below, to terminate at the inside of the glenoid cavity. Some of the Sutures are very important, as they describe the course of the vessels of the brain ; thus the sagittal suture, points out that of the longitudinal sinus ; the anterior superior point of the squamous suture contains the middle artery of the dura mater ; the posterior inferior point of the same suture denotes the passage of the lateral sinus on each side ; and a horizontal line extended round the os occipitis, from that point of one to the same point of the other suture describes the course of the same sinus along the inside of the os occipitis ; and defines the spot to which the tentorium is attached pos- teriorly. And so if a line be continued from the posterior termination of the sagittal suture to this line, and another from the anterior point of the same suture, down to the nasal process of the os frontis, the whole course of the longitudi- nal sinus is completely described. These are points which, though seemingly trivial in themselves, are, as connected with surgical practice, of the highest importance, and there- fore particularly to be attended to. In order to see the parts within the skull, it is necessary to make a transverse section of the os frontis, ossa parietalia, and os occipitis; this should be commenced about half an inch above the superciliary ridges, and carried through the tops of the squamous sutures, through the parietal angles and upper part of the os occipitis. The vault of the cranium, thus removed, is called the skull-cap, calvarium ; and the lower part on which the brain rests, the internal basis, basis interna. In the CALVARIUM. The parts to be observed are the longitudinal groove, sulcus longitudinalis, for the longitudinal sinus, with a num- ber of little pits, more or less deep, in which the glandule pacchionse are situated: there are also the impressiones digitatae

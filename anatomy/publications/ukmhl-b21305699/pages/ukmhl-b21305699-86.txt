; 60 Sect. I. SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES, OR UPPER JAW. Ossa Maxillaria Superiora. Situation. In the front of the face, between the cheek bones, forming a large part of the orbits, and the fore part of the nostrils, face, and palate. Description. The superior maxillary bone is divided into body and processes. The body is of an irregular figure and hollowed to form the maxillary sinus, antrum hig/mnorianum vet sinus niaxiltaris ; its anterior surface hollowed from above downwards, and from side to side, forming the infra orbitar pit, fossa infra orbitaris, in the upper part of which is the infra orbitar hole, foramen infra orbitare : the body is bounded above and to the outer side, anteriorly, by an irregularly den- ticulated process, extending as far as opposite the infra orbi- tar hole, called malar process, processus malaris, which pro- jects most below, and is hollowed behind, for the play of the M. temporalis ; to the inner side and above, springing up from the body, is the nasal process, processus nasalis, of a pyra- midal form, having in its fore part a hole for an artery; it is rough above to join with the os frontis, becomes prominent as it descends, and has its inner edge grooved to receive the os nasi; below which is a notch where the alar cartilages of the nose are attached ; behind, and to the outer side above, the nasal process is concave, to form part of the lachrymal pit, fossa lachrynalis, in which the lachrymal sack is placed; and before it the bone is pinched up so as to form a sharp ridge, behind which, the concavity of the pit descends, becomes wider, and forms part of the nasal duct, ductus ad nasam ; between the malar and the nasal processes extending back- wards is the orbitar plate, lamella orbitalis, of a triangular figure, the base of which facing inwards joins tvith the flat plate of the os ethmoides ; and at its inner part is the lachry- mal notch, incisura lachrymalis, in which the os lachrymale is received : its posterior edge forms the lower part of the spheno maxillary fissure, and has in it the beginning of the infra orbitar canal, canalis infra orbitaris, which runs along the orbitar plate forwards, and when about half an inch distant from the anterior edge of the orbit, dips down to terminate in the infra orbitar hole : the posterior surface of the bone is rounded, and named the tuberosity, tuber maxillare, the inner edge of which is rough to join with the pterygoid process of the os palati, forming with it the palato maxillary canal and hole: from the inner and under part of the body, extends horizontally inwards, the palatine process, processus palatinus, thin about

Sect II. . 140 a. Superior Articulation. The head of the fibula is connected to the tibia by means of a short capsule of synovial membrane, which is strength- ened on the exterior by ligamentous bands, extended obliquely between the bones, and these are generally called the Cap- sular Ligament. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered by a smooth cartilage. h. In the Middle, The tibia and fibula are connected by the Interosseous Ligament. It is a thin expansion, one edge of which is fixed to the outer and posterior angle of the tibia, the other to the corresponding ridge of the fibula. It occupies the space between the two bones, and is composed of oblique fibres. It has an opening above for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels, and is perforated besides in various parts for the passage of the vessels and nerves. c. Inferior Articulation. It is formed by the adaptation of the articular surfaces of the tibia and fibula between which a duplicature of synovial membrane is extended from the ankle joint, and by a strong ligament before and behind. 1. Anterior, Ligamentum anterius. It arises from the outer and fore part of the extremity of the tibia, and is attached to the front of the outer malleolus of the fibula. 2. Posterior, Ligamentumposterius. Is stretched between the corresponding points of the tibia and fibula on the posterior part. ยง 5. OF THE ANKLE JOINT. The bones which enter into the composition of this joint are the tibia, the fibula, and the astragalus. The parts of these bones, connected with the articulation, are the malleolus externus, the malleolus interims, the two articular surfaces of the tibia, and one of the fibula, and the pulley-like articular surface and the two lateral articular sm laces of the astiagalus , all of which are covered by smooth cartilage. The parts which may be distinguished before the integuments have been re- moved, are the malleoli; but in consequence of being sur-

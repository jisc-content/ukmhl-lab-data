124 Sect. II. Use. To extend the foot outwards upon the leg. In the tendon opposite the cuboid bone is usually found a sesamoid bone. A considerable bursa surrounds the tendon at the outer malleolus; and another extends with it into the sole of the foot. 2. M. Peroneus Brevis. Situation. Rather anterior to but partially covered by the former muscle. Origin. By a sharp fleshy attachment above and by a double order of oblique fibres from the loAver part of the an- terior surface, and from the outer edge of the fibula to near the outer malleolus. The fibres are attached to a strong middle tendon which becomes rounder, and descends from the muscle in a groove 'behind the outer malleolus, being there included in the same ligament with that of the former muscle; but afterwards in a sheath of its own. Insertion. Into the base of the metatarsal bone which supports the little toe. Use. To extend the foot upon the leg. The tendon of this muscle is surrounded by a bursa of its own at the outer side of the foot, in addition to that which it has in common with the peroneus longus. ยง 4. ON THE FOOT. Dorsal, on the instep, containing one muscle. M. Extensor Brevis Digitorum Communis. Situation. On the upper and outer part of the foot. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the fore and upper part of the os calcis. It is formed of four slender fleshy bellies, which pass obliquely inwards, and terminate in an equal number cf tendons. Insertion. Into the upper part of the first bone of the great toe, and of the three small toes which are next to it, the tendons spreading upon these and intermixing with the tendinous expansions of the long extensor of the small toes. Use. To extend the four larger toes. On the sole of the foot are found / โข a. Middle Plantar, already described. See page 122. b. Inner Plantar, containing three muscles. 1. M. Abductor Pollicis. Situation. Along the inner edge of the sole of the foot.

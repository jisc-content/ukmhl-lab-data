237 Sect. IV. CHAPTER II. Of the Abdominal Viscera. The parietes of the abdomen are formed by the lumbar ver- tebrae, the bones of the pelvis, the cartilages and ligaments belonging to them, the lumbar mass of muscles, the five pair of abdominal muscles, and the muscles at the outlet of the pelvis. § 1. OF THE CONTENTS OF THE ABDOMEN. The Abdomen is the second, inferior, and larger cavity of the trunk. It contains the organs which are subservient to the digestive process, or the chylopoietic viscera; the urinary organs which secrete, retain, and convey the urine; and a part of the organs of generation. Regions of the Abdomen. The Abdomen is arbitrarily divided into different regions. 1. The Epigastric, which is all that part situated above a line drawn from the last rib on one side transversely to that on the opposite side. This again is subdivided—into a middle region, called the scrobiculus cordis, bounded at the sides by the edges of the cartilages of the ribs, and superiorly, by the cartilago ensi- formis ; and into two lateral regions, covered by the cartilages of the ribs, and hence called the hypochondriac. 2. The Umbilical, which is bounded, above, by the transverse line "between the extremities of the last ribs, and, below, by one drawn between the superior anterior spinous processes of the ilia. This likewise is subdivided into three others by a line drawn on each side perpendicularly upwards from the superior anterior spinous processes to the line bounding this region superiorly: the middle space retains the name of umbilical, the lateral spaces are called the iliac regions. 3. The Hypogastric Region, which comprises the inferior and remaining part of the abdomen. It is bounded, above by

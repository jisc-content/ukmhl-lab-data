430 Sect. VI. CHAPTER V. Of the Ear. + 1 he Organ of Hearing is divided into the external and internal ear. / § 1. OF THE EXTERNAL EAR. The External Ear comprehends the Ear so called, that is, the EXTERNAL APPENDAGE Ol- AURICLE, aild the MEATUS AUDITORIUS externus. Auricle. It has an irregular figure, and is dis- tinguished into the pinna and lobus. The Pinna is the larger and whole superior part; and its external surface is divided into different depressions and eminences, which have received particular names. Eminences:—1. Helix, a nearly semi-circular eminence, which forms a rounded margin beginning at the lobe and terminating nearly opposite to its origin within the concha, which it divides : the portion extending across the concha is sometimes called septum conchce. 2. Anti-helix, surrounds the concha, and is situated within the former, beginning by two eminences which coalesce. 3. Tragus, a small eminence lying over the meatus and connected to the under and fore part of the helix. It is covered by small hairs. 4. Anti- tragus. Opposite the former, less considerable and below the inferior extremity of the anti-helix. Cavities:—1. Fossa innominata, situated between the helix and anti-helix. 2. Scapha, or Fossa Navicularis, situated between the two divergent extremities of the anti- helix. 3. Concha. Is the larger cavity bounded by the helix, tragus, anti-helix, and anti-tragus: divided into two parts by the termination of the helix, or septum conchas. The upper and smaller is continued behind the helix with the fossa innominata, the lower and larger leads to the meatus externus. The back part or inner surface of the pinna is irregularly convex.

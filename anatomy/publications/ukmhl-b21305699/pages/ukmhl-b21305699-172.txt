146 Sect. III. loosely connected beneath, so that it will require caution in the dissection not to raise it with the integuments of the cranium. b. Aural, containing the four small muscles which move the whole auricle. 1. M. Attollens Aurem. Situation. Above the ear. 0> 'igin. Thin and broad from the tendon of the occipito- frontalis. Insertion. Into the upper part of the ear. Use. To raise the auricle. 2. M. Anterior Auris. Situation. Anterior to the ear, but not always found. Origin. From the posterior part of the zygoma. Insertion. Into the back part of the helix anteriorly. Use. To bring the auricle forwards. 3 & 4. M. Retrahentes Aurem. Situation. Behind the ear; are two, sometimes three in number. Origin. From the outer and back part of the root of the mastoid process. Insertion. Into the back part of the concha. Use. To bring the auricle backwards. The parts, which follow next in the dissection, are, the aponeurosis, and the fleshy portion of the temporal muscle, situated on the side of the head, but classed with the muscles in the maxillary region. See page 180. Aponeurosis of the Temporal Muscle. Is a strong tendinous expansion, which covers the whole of the upper and expanded part of the muscle. Above, it is attached around the circumference of the temporalis to the parietal and frontal bones ; and below, to the whole of the zygoma and adjoining part of the os frontis. On dissecting this back, the temporalis will be laid bare. M. Temporalis. Situation. On the side of the head or temple. Origin. Fleshy from the semicircular ridge of the parietal bone, and from the same bone below the ridge; from all the squamous portion of the temporal bone; from the temporal process of the sphenoid bone ; from the external angular process of the os frontis; and from the above-mentioned

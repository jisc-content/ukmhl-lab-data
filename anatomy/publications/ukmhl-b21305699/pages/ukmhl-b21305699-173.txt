Sect. III. 147 aponeurosis. From these attachments the fibres descend in radii, and are continued to the inside of the zygoma. Insertion. This will be afterwards described. § 2. DISSECTION OF THE CONTENTS OF THE CRANIUM. The upper part of the cranium is now to be removed for the purpose of dissecting the brain. An incision is first to be carried through the soft parts in a circular direction, and in the course in which the saw is afterwards to be applied : the line of incision should be made from about half an inch above the orbits, directly backwards on each side to the pro- tuberance of the os occipitis. The saiv is next to be applied in the same track, and a deep groove is to be formed by it, but without penetrating the inner table of the skull. Lastly, with a mallet and sharp edged elevator the inner table is to be broken through, and the skull-cap being torn carefully away, the dura mater will be exposed. OF THE BRAIN. The term includes all the parts of the nervous mass, which, together with its membranes, fill the cavity of the cranium. OF THE MEMBRANES. They are three in number: 1. the Dura Mater; 2. the Tunica Arachnoides ; 3. the Pia Mater. Dura Mater. So called from being the firmest of the three membranes; adheres firmly to the inside of the skull, particularly in the young subject, in consecjuence of the vessels passing from it to the bones to which it forms an in- ternal periosteum. It is first seen when the calvarium has been raised. It lines the whole interior of the cranium, and is extended with the spinal marrow through the vertebral canal. Its exterior surface appears rough after its separation, from the torn state of the vessels and cellular structure connecting it with the bone. Upon it are seen numerous little bodies, called Geandul.® Pacchioni, distributed in different parts, but more numerous near a depression which passes in the mesial line from before to behind, and marks the course of the Longitudinal Sinus ; slit it up, and show the l 2

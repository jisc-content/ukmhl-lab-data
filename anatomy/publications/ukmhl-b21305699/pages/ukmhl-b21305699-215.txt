189 Sect. Ill, 1. M. Hyo-glossus. Situation. Above the cornu of the os hyoides, and par- tially covered by the submaxillary gland and its duct. Origin. Broad and fleshy from the base, cornu, and ap- pendix of the os hyoides, and passes upward and forward. Insertion. Into the side of the tongue near the stylo- glossus. Use. To pull the middle of the tongue downwards, and render the dorsum concave. 2. M. Genio-iiyo-glossus. Situation. Anterior to the former muscle, and partially covered by it and the sublingual gland. Origin. Tendinous, from a rough protuberance, close to the symphysis of the lower jaw internally; it spreads, like a fan, under the tongue. Insertion. Into the whole length of the under and lateral part of the tongue, and into the base of the os hyoides. Use. The posterior fibres protrude the tongue from the mouth, and the anterior bring it back again; when the ante- rior and posterior fibres act together, they render the tongue convex from before to behind ; the middle fibres pull the dorsum down, and render it concave. 3. M. Lingualis. Situation. Between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo- glossus, extending along the whole length of the tongue. Origin. From the root of the tongue laterally. It runs forwards between the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus. Insertion. Into the apex of the tongue with the stylo- glossus. Use. To shorten the sides of the tongue, and render it convex laterally. 4. M. Stylo-glossus. Situation. Between the styloid process and the root of the tongue. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the styloid process, above the stylo-hyoideus, and from the ligament which is extended between that process and the angle of the lower jaw. Insertion. Into the base of the tongue laterally, runs along its side, and is continued as far as the apex. Use. To draw the tongue back, and to assist in rendering the dorsum concave. .

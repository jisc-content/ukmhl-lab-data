Sect. I. CHAPTER II. t Of the JBones of the Trunk. The Trunk is composed of the Spine, Thorax and Pelvis. 1. THE SPINE, Columna Spinalis, Consists of twenty-four bones called vertebrae, which are piled one upon the other, the lowest resting upon the sacrum, and the uppermost supporting the head. THE VERTEBRAE. Each vertebra consists of a body, seven processes, a hole, and four notches. The body, corpus, is the thick strong part situated in the front, of an irregular oval or rounded form ; flat or slightly concave above and below, con- vex laterally before, and hollowed behind where it forms part of the spinal hole, foramen vertebrate. The processes are, four articular,/?, articulares; two transverse, p. transversi; and one spinous process, p. spinosus. Of the articular processes, which join the back part of the body and form the sides of the spinal hole, the two superior have their articulating surfaces facing backwards, and a little outwards, whilst the two inferior, face forwards, and rather inwards. From the roots of the superior articular processes extend outwards, or outwards and backwards, the transverse processes very strong and thick, which are particularly for the attachment of muscles. From between the superior and inferior articular processes extends backwards, or backwards and downwards, the spinous process, this is sharp above, concave below, and more or less hooked downwards. By the junction of the processes with the back part of the body of the vertebra, the spinal hole is formed, which is either - triangular or round, and through it passes the spinal marrow and its membranes. The roots of the articular processes are hollowed out above and below into notches, of which the inferior are very deep; these when the vertebree are fitted

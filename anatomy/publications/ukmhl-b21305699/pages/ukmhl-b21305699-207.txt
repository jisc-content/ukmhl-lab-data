Sect. III. 181 of the lower jaw, which it encloses, and is continued nearly to the last molar tooth. Use. To raise the lower jaw and shut the mouth. 3. M. Pterygoideus Intern us. Situation. To the inner side of the angle and ascending plate of the lower jaw ; to see this and the next muscle, it is best to chisel off the coronoid process and the anterior half of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw, which exposes them without disturbing their relative situation. Origin. Tendinous and fleshy from the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, filling up the space between the plates, and from the pterygoid process of the os palati. Insertion. Into the angle of the inferior maxillary bone internally. Use. To elevate the lower jaw, to bring it forward on the eminentia articularis, and to draw it obliquely to the oppo- site side. 4. M. Pterygoideus Externus. Situation. On the inner side of the cervix of the lower jaw, between it and the last muscle. Origin. From the outer side of the external plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, from the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone adjoining to it, and from the root of the temporal process of the sphenoid bone. Insertion. Into the cervix of the lower jaw, and adheres to the capsular ligament. Use. To pull the lower jaw forwards and obliquely to the opposite side: it also assists in raising the jaw. § 4. OF THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES WHICH PRODUCE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. The direct motions of the lower jaw are :—downward— upward, by which the teeth are brought into contact—for- ward—backward. The muscles therefore may be arranged as—a. Depressors, b. Elevators, c. Motors forward, d. Motors backward. a. Depressors. 1. Digastrici. » ' 2. Mylo-hyoidei. 3. Genio-hyoidei. 4. Genio-hyo-glossi.

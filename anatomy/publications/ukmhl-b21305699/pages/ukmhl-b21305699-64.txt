38 Sect. I. nasal spine, spina nasalis; behind which is the ethmoidal notch, incisura ethmoidalis ; at the outer edges of the nasal process are the two internal angular processes, processus an- guldrcs intend, arid rising up from them the superciliary ridges, arcus superciliares, with a notch or hole, silpra orbitar hole, foramen supra or bit are, in each : as the ridges pass upwards, outwards, and downwards, to terminate in the exter- nal angular processes, processus angiilares extend, the bone appears pinched up, which together with the hollows of the temporal pits behind, render the external more distinct than the internal angular processes : behind and between the an- gular processes are the two orbitar plates, lamellce orbitales, of a triangular shape, the bases in front, the apices behind, and truncated; the orbitar plates are concave from side to side, and.deepest close by the external angular processes, forming a cavity for the lachrymal gland, called lachrymal pit, fossa lachrymalis; behind the internal angular process is a de- pression or a spine, sometimes one, sometimes the other, to give attachment to the pulley of the superior oblique mus- cle of the eye; when a spine, it is called spina trochlearis: between the orbitar plates and the edges of the ethmoidal notch are found the openings of the frontal sinuses. On the Internal Surface are found, In the fronto temporal portion, numerous slight eminences and broad shallow depressions produced by the convolutions of the cerebrum, and called from their form mamillary eminences, endnentice mamillares, and finger- like impressions, impressiones digit, at ec : from the middle of the anterior part of the ethmoidal notch, the internal spine, crista interna, commences, which gives attachment to the dura mater, and projecting sharply backwards, extends up- wards about an inch, and divides into two ridges, with a small cavity between them, continued up to the posterior edge of the bone, and called frontal furrow, sulcus frontalis, in which part of the longitudinal sinus is lodged: it is said, that when the frontal bone remains divided in the adult, there is no spine : on either side of the spine is a concavity which receives the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, and answers to the prominences marking the commencement of ossincation. The upper part of the ethmoido orbital portion supports the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, and is marked by eminentiae mamillares and impressiones digitate. The Foramina in the os frontis are five perfect and six imperfect. The five perfect are, J, Foramen ccecum, situated in the inside of the bone at

Transversi abdominis, 5. Recti abdominis. 6. Pyramidales. Assisted occasionally by the 7- Serrati postici inferiores. 8. Lcngissimi dorsi. 9. Sacro-lumbales. 10. Quadrati lumborum. 2. Motions of the Head and Cervical Ver- tebra;. There are inflections of the head upon the atlas, but they are very inconsiderable: consisting of inflections forwards, which are performed by the, 1. Recti capitis in- terni minores—2. Recti capitis laterales : of inflections back- vmrd, which are performed by the, 1. Recti capitis postici minores—2. Obliqui capitis superiores ; and of lateral inflec- tions by these muscles at the sides. But the principal motions of the head arc produced by the inflections of the cervical vertebral; which may be bent forwards or backwards, and 1- , when the shoulders are fixed.

Sect. III. 213 cess of the temporal bone, and to the outer side of the inser- tion of the rectus major. Use. To draw the head backwards. 4. M. Obliquus Capitis Inferior. Situation. Below the rectus major and obliquus superior, with which two muscles it forms a triangle. Origin. From the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra. Insertion. Into the transverse process of the first verte- bra of the neck. Use. To bring the head with the first vertebra to one side; when both muscles act alternately a rotatory motion is pro- duced. d. Vertebral Region, containing eight muscles. 1. M. Sacro-Lumbalis. Situation. Extending along the angles of the ribs down to the sacrum. Origin. Tendinous without, and fleshy within, from the side, and all the spinous processes of the os sacrum, from the posterior part of the spine of the ilium, and from all the spinous processes, and the roots of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Insertion. Into the angle of each of the ribs by a long and thin tendon. Use. To keep the body erect and to pull down the ribs. From the six or eight inferior ribs arise as many fleshy slips, which terminate in the inner side of this muscle, and are named the Musculi ad sacro-lumbalem accessorii, they pull the ribs upwards, the muscle itself becoming the fixed point. From the upper part, of the muscle a fleshy slip, called 31. eer- vicalis descendens, ascends, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae: it turns the neck obliquely backwards and aside. 2. M. Longissimus Dorsi. Situation. On the inner side of the sacro-lumbalis, with whicl .osely connected. Origin. In common with the sacro-lumbalis. Insertion. Into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebra, chiefly by small double tendons, and by a tendinous and fleshy slip into the lower edge of all the ribs, excepting the two undermost, near the tubercles. Use. It extends the vertebra, and keeps the body erect.

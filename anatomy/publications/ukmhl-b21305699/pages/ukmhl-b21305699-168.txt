II. surfaces of these bones are covered by cartilage, and included in synovial capsules: that which connects the first with the second row being the most remarkable of these articula- tions. a. Of the Astragalus and Os Calcis. Between the inferior surface of the astragalus and the upper part of the os calcis there is a distinct synovial capsule: in addition to which, there are strong ligaments uniting these bones, jLigament a astragalo-calcanea: they are as follows: 1. Interosseous Ligament, Ligamentum inter- osseum. This consists of strong fibres, passing between the corresponding grooves which divide the opposite articular surfaces of these bones. 2. Posterior Ligament, Ligamentum posterius. It passes from the back part of the astragalus to the inner and back part of the os calcis. 3. Anterior Ligament, Ligamentum anterius, which passes from the inner part of the astragalus to the inner and fore part of the os calcis. •«- Z». Of the First and Second Row of the Tarsal Bones. There is a common synovial membrane, which encloses the opposed articular surfaces of the astragalus, the os naviculare, and the os calcis, and there is a distinct synovial ■membrane which includes the articular surfaces of the os calcis and the os cuboides. These bones are connected by the following ligaments'; viz. Ligament between the Astragalus and Os Navicu- lare, Ligamentum astragalo-scaphoideum ; viz. Superior or Dorsal Ligament, Ligamentum superius. It passes from the upper part of the astragalus to the upper part of the os naviculare. Ligaments between the Os Calcis and Os Navicu- lare, Ligamenta calcaneo-scaphoidea ; viz. 1. External Ligament, Ligamentum externum.

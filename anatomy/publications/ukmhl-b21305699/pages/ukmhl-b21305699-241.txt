Sect. III. 215 7. M. Intersfinales. Are smaller muscles, which are situated between, and attached to the spinous processes of the contiguous vertebrae. They are only distinctly fleshy in the cervical vertebrae, and are five in number. Each arises double from the spinous process of the lower vertebra, and is inserted into the spinous process of the vertebra above. In the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae they are rather small tendons than muscles. Use. To assist in extension of the spine. \ 8. M. Intertransversales. Are similar small fleshy bundles, which pass between the transverse processes of the contiguous vertebrae. Those of the neck consist of six distinct double muscles. There are also four distinct fleshy bundles between the transverse processes of the lumbar ver- tebrae ; but those of the back are rather tendons than muscles. Use. To sway the vertebrae laterally on each other. In the above account of the dorsal muscles their attach- ments are stated according to the description which has been adopted by most anatomists ; but it is necessary to remark that they are subject to frequent varieties, and that they are frequently found to be attached to a fewer or greater number of vertebrae, than has been there laid down.

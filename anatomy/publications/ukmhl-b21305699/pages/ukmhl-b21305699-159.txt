133 Sect. II. CHAPTER IV Of the Joints of the Lower Extremity. For general directions respecting the dissection of these parts, see p. 98. The Joints of the Lower Extremity are—1. Those of the Pelvis.—2. Hip joint.—3. Knee joint.—4. Those of the libia and Fibula.—5. Ankle joint.—6. Joints of the Foot. § 1. OF THE PELVIS. The articulations of the bones of the pelvis are formed in part by ligamento-cartilaginous substances; and in part by ligaments : but distinct synovial capsules are not found. a. Sacro-iliac Symphysis. Is formed by the ilium and sacrum, and the anterior and smaller portion of the articulating surface of each bone is co- vered by a smooth cartilage. These cartilages touch each other, but are seldom completely united, and are lubricated by a slippery fluid, of a thicker consistence than synovia. On the other hand the posterior and larger portions are not covered by dartilage, but are firmly united by an exceedingly tough and strong Jihro-cartilaginous structure, which has been sometimes described as a peculiar ligament under the name of the Sacro-iliac, Ligamentum sacrd-iliacum. The articulation is further strengthened by one posterior and two anterior ligaments. 1. Posterior, Ligamentum pelvis posticum. Consisting of perpendicular and oblique fibres forming a strong broad ligament, which passes from the posterior extremity of the spine of the ilium to the transverse-like processes of the third and fourth pieces of the sacrum or false vertebrae. Be- sides these there are irregular bands which cross in different directions, and assist in strengthening the articulation. > 2. Superior Anterior, Ligamentum pelvis an- ticum superius. Is formed of oblique fibres, which pass from

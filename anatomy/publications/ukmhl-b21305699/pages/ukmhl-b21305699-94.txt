68 Sect. I. 2. THE NOSTRILS, Cava Nasalia, Arc double, and composed of fourteen bones; four single, and Jive pairs, viz. Os frontis, Ossa nasi, Os ethmoides, lachrymalia. Os sphenoides, maxillaria superiora, Vomer, palatina, & turbinata. The superior maxillary and nasal bones form the anterior boundary; the superior maxillary, turbinated and palate bones form the sides; the palatine and sphenoid bone form the posterior boundary; the floor is formed by the superior maxillary and palatine bones ; and the roof by the sphenoid, ethmoid, and lachrymal bones. The two nostrils are sepa- rated from each other by a bony septum formed of the nasal plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer and the nasal crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. Each nostril is divided into three chambers, meatus. 1. Superior chamber, M. superior, situated above the tur- binated plate of the ethmoid bone, between it and the crybri- form plate ; in it are The openings of the posterior ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. 2. Middle chamber, M. medius, situated between the tur- binated bone below and the turbinated plate of the ethmoid bone, has in it The openings of the anterior ethmoidal, frontal, and maxil- lary sinuses. 3. Inferior chamber, M. inferior, situated between the floor of the nostril below, and the turbinated bone; has in it The opening of the nasal duct. Besides these are, the anterior and posterior openings of the nostrils, which are common to all three chambers. 3. THE PALATE. Fornix Palatines. The bony structure of the palate consists of two pairs of bones and a single one. Ossa maxillaria superiora. Ossa palati, & Os sphenoides. The margin is formed by the alveolar processes of the su- perior and inferior maxillary bones, and the arch of the palate by the palatine processes of the same bone and palate bone.

INTRODUCTION. xii Anatomy, like other sciences of experiment and observation, has become, by the industry of its cultivators, a collection of numerous, but too often insulated facts ; and our ignorance of their meaning and connection has become apparent in pro- portion to their number. This condition of the science has influenced its language :â€”names have been multiplied, which neither describe nor explain, and different names, that owe their introduction to the mere caprice of the individual ana- tomist, have been applied to the same parts. Description has been exhausted, without adding to our knowledge, and with- out reference to the importance of structure and function. The number of objects which must be attended to, in order to the acquirement of the necessary theoretical knowledge of medicine and surgery, is such that the greater part of the students, who visit the hospitals of the metropolis, can devote but little time to any single branch; and in addition to the theoretical part, the field of practice, which an hos- pital affords, claims a large portion of their time. But the state of the science, and the circumstances of the student, are not perhaps the greatest bars to improvement. The small progress too often found, and the perplexity of the student during that progress, are still more attributable to his want of previous information how to arrange the numerous but single facts which are offered to the mind; so that he is obliged to be seeking for a plan during the period he should have been acquiring the materials that are to fill it up; and by the time he has prepared it, the period allotted for his studies is expired. It is in this respect that lectures are not only valuable but indispensable. In them a comprehensive idea is gained of the whole ; and whilst the parts are displayed, their functions in the healthy state, and the importance of particular structures, are adverted to, with the changes which they undergo from morbid actions or from accident. Thus by forming the groundwork of physiological and pathological knowledge, the

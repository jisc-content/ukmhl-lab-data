Sect. I. 59 CHAPTER VI. Of the Bones of the Face. These consist of six pairs and two single bones. CHEEK BONES. Ossa Malarum. Situation. At the outer and under part of the orbit and the side of the face forming the prominence of the cheek. Description. The os malae is of an irregular figure, it is divided into three faces and five processes : 1. Superficies malaris, in front and to the outer side, irre- gularly convex from before to behind ; its anterior inner edge bounded by the maxillary process, p. maxillaris ; its external posterior edge bounded by the zygomatic process,^, zygoma- ticus, and joining with the malar process of the os temporis to form the zygoma, under which the M. temporalis plays. 2. Superficies orbitaris, above forming the internal orbitar process, p. orbitaris internus, bounded above and to the outer side by the p. orbitaris superior, and below to the inside by the p. orbitaris inferior. 3. Superficies temporalis, situated behind, irregularly con- cave, and completing the temporal pit, which is therefore composed of five bones, viz. os temporis, parietale, sphe- noides, frontis, and malae. There is but one Foramen in this bone. Foramen malare, through which the malar nerve passes. Junctions. The os malae is joined by its zygomatic pro- cess to the malar process of the os temporis ; by its superior orbitar process to the external angular process of the os fron- tis; by the posterior edge of its internal orbitar process with the orbitar plate of the os sphenoides; and by the inner edge of the same process and the inferior orbitar process with the os maxillare superius. 1 The muscles attached to it are four; viz., M. obliquus infe- rior oculi, zygomaticus major & minor, masseter : the M. orbicularis palpebrarum extends over it.

Sect. IV, 235 The study of this part of anatomy should be begun by ex- amining the manner in which the thigh is separated from the abdomen; and, at the same time, the mode in which they communicate. The peritonaeum is to be removed from the lower part of the abdomen ; then behind and below Poupart’s ligament, (which has also received the name of the Crural Arch,) the opening may be perceived by which the iliac vessels are passing from the posterior part of the abdomen to the upper and anterior part of the thigh. This opening is chiefly occupied by the femoral artery, and on its pubic side by the femoral vein; to the inner side of the vein one or more absorbent glands will be found. The space around the opening between the body of the os pubis and Poupart’s liga- ment is filled up :—Behind, by the psoas and iliacus muscles and the fascia covering them. This, the Fascia Iljaca, is attached to the inner labium of the crista of the ilium, extends behind the iliac vessels, and on the inner side of these is at- tached to the linea ilio-pectinea; it is found particularly firm where assisting to shut up the abdomen at the outer part of the iliac vessels behind the crural arch, and sends a portion with the femoral vessels into the thigh:—Before, by the Fascia Transversalis, which has been already spoken of as forming the internal abdominal ring, in describing the parts connected with inguinal hernia. After lining the pos- terior part of the abdominal muscles, and being closely at- tached to the crural arch, the fascia transversalis unites on the outer side with the fascia iliaca between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the iliac vessels, the place of their junction being marked by a white line; on the inner it extends to the pubes, but becomes thinner and less distinct, and it sends out a process which descends behind the crural arch and passes before the femoral vessels into the thigh. The portion of the fascia iliaca which passes with the femoral vessels from behind, and the portion of the fascia transversalis which passes with them from before, seem by their union at the sides to form the Femoral Sheath ; this at the begin- ning is of a funnel shape, but is flattened from before to be- hind, and it becomes contracted a little below the crural arch. The Fascia Transversalis is said to extend as far as the hole in the tendon of the triceps femoris; but the Fascia Iliaca not further than the origin of the arteria profunda from the femoral artery. By detaching the sheath from its connections on the pubic side, it will be found that to the inner side the space behind the crural arch is narrowed by a horizontal portion of tendon of a triangular figure, extending from the arch to the opposite

82 Sect. IL winch cannot be seen till those in the superficial region have been removed. 1. M. Flexor Digltorum Communis Profundus (perforans.) Situation. Immediately behind the M. flexor dig. com. sub. Origin. From the upper two-thirds of the outer side of the ulna, and from a considerable portion of the interosseous ligament. It divides into four fleshy bellies, terminating in an equal number of tendons, which pass behind the liga- ment of the wrist, through the palm, and through the divisions of the tendons of the M. flexor dig. subl. Insertion. Into the fore and upper part of the third phalanges of the fingers. Use. To bend the last joint of the fingers. It is better to trace the tendons of the two above described muscles to their insertion, by raising the aponeurosis pal- maris, and at the same time to dissect the four lumbricales, although these parts are situated in the middle palmar region. (See page 87.) It will be the fittest opportunity likewise to display the ligaments and sheaths connected with the tendons of these muscles. The M. Lumbricales. Situation. Close to the tendons of the flexor muscles in the palm of the hand; four in number, and named from their resemblance to earth-worms. Origin. From the outer side of the tendons of the flexor pro- fundus, a little above the lower edge of the annular ligament. Insertion. By slender tendons, which spread on the outer side of the first phalanges of the fingers. Use. To assist the action of the long flexors. ยง 6. LIGAMENTS AND SHEATHS OF THE FLEXOR MUSCLES. Anterior Annular, or Transverse Ligament, Ligamentum annulare vel transversum carpi, consists of 'transverse and oblique fibres, forming a strong band, which is stretched across between the projecting points of the os pisi- forme and os uneiforme, to the os scaphoides and os trapezium. The tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, and the tendon of the flexor radialis in a sheath of its own, pass behind it.

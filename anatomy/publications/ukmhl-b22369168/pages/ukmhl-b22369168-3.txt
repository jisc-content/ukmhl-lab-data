Reprinted from the “ G/d*'j to;V3^r ttmt-. JoiirncdV^for December, 1S95.] EPONYMIC STRUCTURES IN HUMAN ANATOMY. By JAMES F1NLAYSON, M.D., Physician to the Glasgow Western Infirmary and to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children ; Honorary Librarian to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow, &c. During last winter one of my “bibliographical demonstrations”' in our Faculty library here was designed to illustrate eponymic- structures in anatomy. I had often felt that the names of great men in our profession which had happened to be preserved in the nomenclature of anatomy furnished about the only instruction in the history of medicine which many of our students acquired. Every one knows at least the name of Herophilus in this way; and not a few know that he was of the Alexandrian school before the Christian era. How many know as much of his equally famous contemporary,. Erasistratus ? But the names attached to the structures they are studying are usually mere names: very often not even the vaguest idea of their date or nationality is associated with them. How many of our students, in speaking of the capsule of Glisson or the foramen of Winslow, know whether Glissoix or Winslow was an Englishman ? In preparing my demonstration I had the aid of two of my clinical assistants—Dr. John Love and Dr. John W. Findlay— without whose help I could not possibly have attempted the work. We searched out all the eponymic structures we could find, and then we searched out the books or papers of the authors, where these are described by them, whenever this was possible. Cards were then written with the name of the author, his nationality and designation, and the date of his birth and death. These were laid on the volumes, which were arranged on long tables in rough chronological order, as precision is impossible in this respect. We began with the

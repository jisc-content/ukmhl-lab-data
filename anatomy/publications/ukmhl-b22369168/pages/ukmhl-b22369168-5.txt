Dr. Finlayson—Eponymic Structures in Anatomy. 3 kinds may be detected by those whose reading and studies bear more on such subjects than mine ; Mr. Henry E. Clark has already given me some help in this direction. Very many sources of information had to be searched, but the following are amongst the most important: — The New Sydenham Society's Lexicon, Wernich’s Biographisches LexiJcon, and the Surgeon-General's Index-Catalogue of the Medical Library at Washington. The propriety of naming structures after men need not be discussed here. The actual fact is that they are so named; and the chronological arrangement showed very plainly how much this had increased within the last 100 years. This table may help to lessen what is apt to be a grave inconvenience. Abernethy, John, English surgeon and anatomist, 1764—1831. —Abernethy''sfascia (over external iliac artery).

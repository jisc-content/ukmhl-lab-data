By JAMES F1NLAYSON, M.D., Physician to the Glasgow Western Infirmary and to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children ; Honorary Librarian to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow, &c. During last winter one of my “bibliographical demonstrations”' in our Faculty library here was designed to illustrate eponymic- structures in anatomy. I had often felt that the names of great men in our profession which had happened to be preserved in the nomenclature of anatomy furnished about the only instruction in the history of medicine which many of our students acquired. Every one knows at least the name of Herophilus in this way; and not a few know that he was of the Alexandrian school before the Christian era. How many know as much of his equally famous contemporary,. Erasistratus ? But the names attached to the structures they are studying are usually mere names: very often not even the vaguest idea of their date or nationality is associated with them. How many of our students, in speaking of the capsule of Glisson or the foramen of Winslow, know whether Glissoix or Winslow was an Englishman ? In preparing my demonstration I had the aid of two of my clinical assistants—Dr. John Love and Dr. John W. Findlay— without whose help I could not possibly have attempted the work. We searched out all the eponymic structures we could find, and then we searched out the books or papers of the authors, where these are described by them, whenever this was possible. Cards were then written with the name of the author, his nationality and designation, and the date of his birth and death. These were laid on the volumes, which were arranged on long tables in rough chronological order, as precision is impossible in this respect. We began with the2 Dr. Finlayson—Eponymic Structures in Anatomy. fragments of Herophilus collected by Marx, and went on to the works of living men. Marks were often inserted in the volumes where the structures were described or delineated. The volumes arranged in this way gave a vivid idea of the progress of anatomy; and the illustrations were, of course, of very special interest to those who had never seen them before. So much labour had been expended on this demonstration that it seemed desirable to expend a little more in making the list even more complete, so that it might be published for the use of others, although, no doubt, the sight of the books and plates was really the specialty of the demonstration. In printing this list, an alphabetical rather than a chrono- logical order seemed to be more useful and practicable. The dates given are those of the birth and death when these were ascertained. In the case of living authors, a dash (—) after the date of birth indicates that death had not occurred, or was not known to have occurred. In some cases, only the date of birth or of death was known; in others, the date of graduation was all that was available; in a few, the date of the paper concerned with the name of the structure was the ■only clue; or perhaps the date of a professorial appointment. In some cases, the nationality as judged by birth is different from that acquired by residence or professorial duties—in a few cases this correction has been added when it was known. Indications of the locality of some of the less known structures have been added in brackets to aid the memory of the reader, or to guide him; but no attempt, of course, at precise definition is made in such a list. The structures included in the list are those only which pertain to human anatomy. Purely microscopic terms, and those found only in comparative anatomy and embryology, and many terms in anthropology, have been omitted; but the line of demarcation cannot be drawn absolutely, and the general interest or currency of the term has determined the inclusion of some names near the border line. The data here given, however bald they may seem, are not always readily obtained; very possibty errors of variousDr. Finlayson—Eponymic Structures in Anatomy. 3 kinds may be detected by those whose reading and studies bear more on such subjects than mine ; Mr. Henry E. Clark has already given me some help in this direction. Very many sources of information had to be searched, but the following are amongst the most important: — The New Sydenham Society's Lexicon, Wernich’s Biographisches LexiJcon, and the Surgeon-General's Index-Catalogue of the Medical Library at Washington. The propriety of naming structures after men need not be discussed here. The actual fact is that they are so named; and the chronological arrangement showed very plainly how much this had increased within the last 100 years. This table may help to lessen what is apt to be a grave inconvenience. Abernethy, John, English surgeon and anatomist, 1764—1831. —Abernethy''sfascia (over external iliac artery).

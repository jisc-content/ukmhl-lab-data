32 CHAPTER III. ON THE CAUSE OF THE ENTRANCE OF AIR INTO VEINS DI- VIDED DURING OPERATIONS ; WITH SOME CONSIDERA- TIONS ON THE MEANS MOST LIKELY TO AVERT DEATH IN SUCH CASES. The only eondition absolutely necessary for the admis- sion of air during an operation is, that the vein be kept in a patulous state, for when in this condition, the movements of the chest in respiration (assisted perhaps by the tendency in the right auricle to form a vacuum during its diastole) are sufficient to cause the air to enter. This may at least be inferred from Sir David Barry's experiments. He shewed, that during inspiration a suction influence is ex- erted upon the blood in the veins entering the chest. Now when this suction is exerted upon the contents of a wounded vein, incapable of collapsing from disease of its coats or any other cause, these contents, whatever physical proper- ties they present, must be under the influence of the same law which was pointed out by Sir David Barry with regard to the blood in unopened vessels. Should the vein be completely severed, it is evident that air, and air only, will pass down to the heart; but if, on the other hand, it be merely wounded, there will be a mixture of blood and air.

Thus Dr Alison, in a very able paper published in one of the numbers of the Journal of Science, says, when referring to some previously performed experiments of Mv Brodie, " when Mr Brodie concludes from these expei'iments that the suppression of the secretion was to be attributed to the division of the nerves, and that the secretions of the stomach and intes- tines are very much under the control of the ner- vous system, his inferences must command gene- ral assent."* " Functional secretion," says Mayo, "is to a remarkable degree influenced through the nervous system." f Bostock too, confesses, that " it is sufficiently obvious that the organs of se- cretion in the higher orders of animals are very much under the influence of the nerves, and in many cases materially affected by them." ^ But do these secretions depend on some influ- ence communicated by the nerves to the elaborat- ing organs ? can they, or can they not, take place without this transmitted agency ? The principal objections which have been raised to the possession of this power by any portion of the nervous sys- tem will now fall to be considered.

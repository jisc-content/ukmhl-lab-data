42 side of the neck of a woman in the Manchester Infirmary, in 1791, he divided the internal jugular vein. " The tor- rent of blood," he says, " pouring out from so large a cavity, and the noise occasioned by the rushing in of air, added to other appearances, formed a picture more frightful than I ever beheld." The patient recovered; and there is nothing said about the injurious consequences of the admis- sion of air; from which we may presume, that none were apparent. It is merely stated, that the patient experienced no morbid affection of the head from the obliteration of the vessel.* It naturally occurs, when reflecting upon the practical inference to be drawn from these cases, that the advantage to be derived from the abstraction of blood from the vessel which has been divided, may be prevented, or that even greater danger may be incurred, by hazarding the admission of an additional quantity of air into the right chambers of the heart. If the vessel is gaping, owing to disease of its coats, perhaps the safest plan would be to open the largest healthy vein in the neck which may be within reach ; for from what has already been stated, the chance of saving the patient depends almost entirely upon the speedy and effectual un- loading of the heart. Should the air have gained access, merely from the temporary gaping of the vessel, occasioned by the position of the patient during the operation, there can then be no objection, not only to sucking the air out by it, but also to giving the additional relief to the heart, which would be afforded by the derivation of blood, and the contractions of the auricle. â€¢ Medical Facts and Observations, vol. viii. p. 23.

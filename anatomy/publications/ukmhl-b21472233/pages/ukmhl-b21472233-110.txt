As the phenomena preceding death were quite similar to those already described, and as there was no post mortem examination, a detail of the case would throw no additional light on the subject, and is conse- quently omitted.* There are various circumstances which render it possible that in some instances in which women die unexpectedly after parturition, and when all seems going on well, death is owing to air entering the circulation by means of the open mouths of the veins communicating with the uterine sinuses.-f These orifices, immediately after the separation of the decidua, are very large. They have been made the subject of inves- tigation by many modern as well as old anatomists and ob- stetricians, and upon the whole the various descriptions cor- respond. Burton says, that the uterine sinuses " in the ninth month of gravitation are so large as to admit the end of the biggest finger; and their orifices that open into the cavity of the womb, wUl at the same time admit the end of the little finger."^ Now the uterus not unfrequently contracts and expands alternately with considerable energy after the expulsion of the foetus, and it is quite reasonable to suppose that air may sometimes be sucked into the gaping mouths of the uterine * Medical Gazette, vol. xii., p. 270â€”Case of Nancy Bunker. f Olivier, in the article Air in the Diet, de Med., (2nd edit.) asks whether those cases of unexpected death after parturition may not be ex- plained in this way. $ New System of Midmfery, p. 19.

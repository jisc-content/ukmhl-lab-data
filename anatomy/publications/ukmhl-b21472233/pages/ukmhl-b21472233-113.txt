21 In conclusion then, it may be stated as clearly established, that when a quantity of air, by entering the circulation, proves suddenly fatal, the immediate cause of the arrest- ment of the vital functions is the inability of the right side of the heart to contract and expel its elastic contents ; and therefore, all the phenomena which follow are consequences of this first cause.* " Accidents in consequence of the entrance of air into the circulation, have occurred to the following operators: Sir A. Cooper; Mr. Barlow of Lancashire; Mr. Simmonds of Manchester; Dupuytren, Beauchere, Clemot, and Roux, of Paris; Drs. Mott and Stevens of New York; Dr. Warren of Hai ward, U, S. ; Dr. Castara of Lundville ; Delpech of Montpellier ; Graefe of Berlin ; Goullard of Lyons; and doubtless to many others, by whom the cases have not been put on record. Indeed it is surprising, that so many of these accidents should have been pub- lished, during the comparatively short period that has elapsed, since Dupuytren first turned the attention of the medical world to the subject.

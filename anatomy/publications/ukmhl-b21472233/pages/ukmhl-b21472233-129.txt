37 Haller, both in his Physiology, and in his treatise on the Movement of the Blood, distinctly states that the right side of the heart can be emptied by opening the jugular vein. He believed this to be entirely owing to derivation of blood, and as in no way dependent upon the contractions of the heart. This view was also adopted by Spallanzani, who repeated the experiments of Haller. The flow of blood from vessels opened at a distance from the centre of the cir- culation, certainly appears to depend entirely upon deriva- tion ; but when large veins near the heart are opened, there seems also to be another cause in operation. This was first stated by my friend Dr. John Reid, in a paper which he published in the 127th number of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. He conceives that the unloading of the heart, when the jugular vein is cut into, depends upon two causes; one of them being the derivation of Haller, and the other the contractions of the right side of the heart. In cases of extreme engorgement, the latter cause can only come into operation, as a consequence of the former. " At each contraction," Dr. Reid remarks, " the heart attempts to force a certain quantity of blood along the ves- sels connected with it, and as there is no vis a tcrgo to pre-*' vent the action of the heart moving the blood along the veins in its immediate neighbourhood, a certain quantity is forced out through the opening in the jugular." Of the accuracy of this I am perfectly satisfied, having witnessed the phenomenon in the experiments detailed by Dr. Reid, and also in the cases of different qnimals which I have since killed in various ways. I have endeavoured by a detail of experiments to show the advantage resulting from a copious depletion by the ju-

That the air sometimes proves fatal, by depriving the heart of its supply of arterial blood through the coronary, arteries, appears to be a very visionary doctrine, and I can- not recollect any facts which give it even a semblance of truth.* With a view of elucidating the question proposed for consideration in this chapter, the following experiments were performed. Experiment.—The subject of this experiment was a horse about seventeen hands high, and in pretty good condition, but which was condemned to death on account of an incurable cancer of the foot. A tube, a quarter of aa inch in diameter, was introduced into the left jugular vein. The man who blew, filled his chest twice, and continued to blow for a minute. He then stopped on account of the symptoms of uneasiness which the animal exhibited. In a few seconds the horse staggered and fell, and in three minutes from the commencement of the introduction of air, was quite dead. During the period he survived after fall- ing, he made great and violent efforts to inspire, and during that time, was strongly convulsed, the convulsions com- mencing soon after he fell. It was computed that he lost about eight quarts of blood, which is the quantity usually taken at an ordinary venesection. , Seclio.—Air was fotind in every visible vein over the whole body. The chest was opened an hour and a half * Another very questionable doctrine is that of Pigeaux, who denies that the entrance of air is the sole cause of death, and considers tliat much of the deleterious consequences may be attributed to the injury sustained by the small nervous branches. Surely this is absurd. Gaz. Med. -.28 Mars 18D3.

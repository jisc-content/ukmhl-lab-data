APPENDIX. Experiment I. July 13,1836.1^ p. m.â€”Two rabbits, previous- ly kept fasting for twenty-four hours, were fed for half an hour on vegetables, and at a quarter to two the par vagum was divided on each side above the recurrent, and about an inch in length re- moved. Immediately after the operation the breath- ing appeared difficult, but soon became more placid, though still evidently affected. In about an hour the respiration again laborious, and attended with a slight noise, which increased up to four o'clock. In the second rabbit, the nerves were exposed, and lifted from their places, but not divided. It appeared quite unaffected by the operation. At 8 P. M. Noise attending inspiration of the first somewhat increased. The second is quite lively. The heart's action in both unaffected from the first. Six hours and a half after the operation both killed and immediately examined. The stomach of the second, was not fully dis- tended with the masticated food of a dark-green colour; a portion towards the lesser curvature was semifluid, of which some had passed into the duodenum.

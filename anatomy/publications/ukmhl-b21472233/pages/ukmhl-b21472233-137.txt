45 lesion which is the result of an exhausting disease, it may be hoped that a successful revival might sometimes be effected by means of the injection of the saline solution into the veins."* There can be little doubt, but that the injection of a fluid into the veins would increase and not diminish the danger; but what analogy exists between cholera patients, and the class of cases at present under consideration, it is not easy to divine. Is a man, writing in any work, but especially in one which is to be extensively circulated among the junior members of the profession, jus- tified in making such a recommendation, without previously putting it to the test of experiment upon the inferior ani- mals, or at least having some plausible theoretical argu- ment to adduce in its support The measures which the surgeon ought to adopt with a view of guarding against the admission of air during an operation, are very obvious. When operating on parts e^'' tensively diseased, or when cutting in the vicinity of the large veins in the neck, he must pay special attention to the position of the patient, and when obliged to divide a large vein, he ought not to be unprepared for the accident taking place. With a view of averting it, he ought, before making the hazardous incision, to request the patient to take a full inspiration, so that the vessel may be divided during expiration. Should it happen, however, that in spite of every pre- caution, a dangerous quantity of air gain access, not an instant must be lost in adopting the measures formerly pointed out, as the most likely to save the life of the patient. â€¢ Cyclop, of Pruct.

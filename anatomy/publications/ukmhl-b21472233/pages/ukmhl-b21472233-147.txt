55 In the Medical Observations and Inquiries there is a sin- gular case mentioned, which I am somewhat inclined to classify with the above. The patient during life was sen- sible of a noise within the thorax resembling " a stream of water passing over obstructions, or passing over a narrow confined place. He was subject to exacerbations, and when he varied his position the circulation became confused, and as it were wholly carried on in a corner of his heart, which at such times beat with a whizzing noise. During his ill- ness he felt the greatest pain when the noise seemed least; so that when speaking of his situation he had a common expression that Gush ivas his friend; while Gush stood by him he should live."—At last he died. Upon dissec- tion the pericardium was found loaded with fat. The heart in situ was longer and more pointed than usual for its size. The right auricle was much enlarged, and very thin, bear- ing strong marks of inflammation. The ventricle having lost its usual firmness and colour, was so transparent, as in a manner to admit an inspection into its very substance. Upon cutting into these two cavities a considerable quantity of air rushed out, and upon laying them, both ojien they ap- peared as totally void of blood as if they had been washed clean. The interstices between the chordae tendincae were full of air bubbles. A variety of less remarkable morbid appearances were noticed. Unfortunately it is not stated at what period after death the inspection was made, so that the case standing, as I believe it at present does, per se, is deprived of much of its value.* Without laying any weight whatever upon this last case, • Med.

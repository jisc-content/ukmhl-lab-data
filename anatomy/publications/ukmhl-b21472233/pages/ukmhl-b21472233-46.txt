6 These generally were, that after fruitless attempts to vomit, along with very difficult respiration, the animals perished a few hours after the operation, and on dissection, putrefaction of the contents of the stomach was discovered. He states, that his observations contradict those of Brunn, as to the pain occasioned by the operation, the length of time the animals lived after it, and the conver- sion of the contents of the stomach into faeces, which the latter imagined he detected. * I can- not here help expressing my regret that this able physiologist did not pay more attention to this enquiry. Blainville found that, on dividing the nerves some secretion did take place, but that the digestion of food was wholly suspended. Dupuy|: has recorded that when the eighth pair of nerves is divided in the neck in various animals, as sheep, horses, &c. the oesophagus is found to be filled with unaltered food, as also is the stomach, on the con- tents of which no change appears to take place. He found that when the trachea was artificially opened, so that a free supply of atmospheric air was afforded to the lungs, the animals usually lived for seven or eight days, and at length ap- peared to die from affection of the digestive organs alone. When, however, this precaution was not taken, they perished in a few hours from conges- tion of the lungs, the air passage being closed # Haller, Opera Minora, Vol. i. f .Tournal de Modecine, 1816, Vol. xxxvii.

15 feeble. The pulse was extremely small, frequent, hard, and irregular. The whole body was covered with a cold sweat, and he had some convulsions. All restorative measures failed, and the patient died a quarter of an hour after the fatal cut had been given. On examining the body eighteen hours after death, the chest was found to contain a quantity of red coloured serum. Thelungs were free from all disease; — they crepitated and filled both thoracic cavities. There was no opening into the right pleura. On examining the seat of the operation, it was found that the jugular vein had been wounded. In factj a portion of this vessel (half its calibre, and an inch in length,) had been cut out. The wound in the jugular, terminated just as it joined the subclavian vein. The superior vena cava contained no blood ; its internal membrane was red. The pericardium was filled with serosity. None of the ca- ivities of the heart contained any blood. The left side seem- ed to be in a natural state;—perhaps the ventricle was a little thickened. The walls of the right cavities were flabby, very thin, pale, and of a much greater calibre than those of the opposite side. The brain presented a grey appearance, and all its blood vessels of a size sufficient to be visible, were distended with air. The aorta, crural arteries, and in- ferior vena cava contained air mixed with blood. An event of a similar nature to that now detailed, hap- pened at the Hotel Dieu in Paris in 1822, when Dupuytren was removing a tumour from a girl's neck. A sound simi- lar to that heard in the former case, led the operator to re- mark that had he been cutting in the neighbourhood of the air passages he would have supposed that he had made an opening into some of them. No sooner had he said this.

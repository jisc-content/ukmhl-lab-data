38 gular vein, in cases of poisoning with Creosote.* I have since extended the inquiry to other poisons, and in particular have made farther observations for the" purpose of elucidating this point more fully with regard to Creosote and Prussic acidâ€” substances which in large doses unquestionably prove fatal, by producing a sudden arrestment or derangement of the movements of the heart. Since the cause of death, both in poisoning with these substances, and from the entrance of a large quantity of air into the right side of the heart is the same, viz. the ina- bility of the heart to overcome the distention, it does not seem inappropriate to detail the following Experiment, which illustrates most beautifully the bene- ficial effects of copious depletion, when a poisonous dose of Prussic acid has been administered. A free opening was made in the jugular vein of an ordinary sized pointer dog, and hemorrhage prevented by means of pressure. A dose of Prussic acid was then administered, of such strength as to contain about a drop of the real acid. The animal be- came almost immediately affected, uttered some faint cries, in twenty seconds fell down and lay for a few seconds mo- tionless on the floor. He then began to struggle as if in the agonies of death ; but the vein now broke out, and the blood flowed in a rapid and copious stream. Immediately the dog shewed signs of returning vigour. He raised his head, then in a few seconds looked around him, and his eyes, which were formerly dim and suffused, regained their natu- ral lustre. From this time he rapidly recovered, and be- * Treatise on Creosote, pp. 84, 85, and 92. Edinburgh, 1836.

11 after death, when the lungs were seen collapsed, and in no degree emphysematous. All the cavities of the heart, but particularly the right auricle, were distended, and had a tense elastic feel. The right side was first examined. The auricle was enormously distended, and upon a small opening being made with the scalpel, frothy blood, with which this cavity seemed to be entirely filled, instantly rushed out. The greater part of the ventricle was filled with fluid and coagulated blood, but there were also some in a frothed state. The left auricle contained frothy blood, and some coagulated masses. In the left ventricle the quantity of air was just sufficient to make its existence appreciable; but there was a great quantity of blood, both fluid and coagu- lated in this cavity.* Experiment.—A tube about equal in diameter to a crow quill was inserted into the right jugular vein of a rabbit. In the course of two minutes I introduced three or four full expirations. During this time the animal lay quite tran- quil, and did not struggle in the least, but the breathing was difficult, and the heart's action feeble and fluttering. Just as I desisted from blowing, I observed some slight convul- sive movements of the limbs, and in a few seconds more they recurred. Respiration had now ceased, and there were no more convulsions. The thorax was immediately laid open. Great venous congestion everywhere presented itself. The heart was enormously distended. Upon puncturing the right auricle and ventricle, air unmixed with blood is- sued forth, and in the auricle there was a good deal of • Dr. John Reid, and Mr. William Scott were present at the perform- ance of this experiment.

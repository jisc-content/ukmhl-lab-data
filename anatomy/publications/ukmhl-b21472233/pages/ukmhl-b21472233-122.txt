Upon inspection after death, it was found that the vein had been wounded transversely, and that on account of the morbid thickening of its walls, the inferior aperture was gaping. At the mo- ment the operator lifted up the tumour to enable him to dissect it out, a sort of whistling noise was heard, like that produced by the entrance of air into the empty receiver of an air pump. The patient uttered a plaintive cry, and be- came greatly agitated—the contractions of the heart were hurried, the pulse was weak, respiration long and la- boured, and at length, after one protracted inspiration, fol- lowed by a short and hasty expiration, symptoms of approaching death were manifested. By preventing the admission of any more air, and the employment of frictions, and stimulants to the nostrils, and dashing water on the face, the circulation and respiration were restored. The dissection was discontinued, and the tumour enclosed in a double ligature. All went on well till the seventh day, but on that morning the patient suffered from oppression, diffi- culty of speech, then from coma, and died during the night. Sectio. The eighth pair of nerves were uninjured. Both lungs were slightly congested, and emphysematous spots were observed under the pulmonary pleura. The cavities of the heart were empty. On puncturing the abdominal and thoracic aorta in different places, a great many bubbles of air escaped, mixed with bloody serum, and the same could be observed, but in less quantity, in the iliac arte- ries.* There was no air in the vessels of the brain.

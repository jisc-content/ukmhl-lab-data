53 havinjr been found distended with air, are not so numerous as those in which the air has been found only in the vessels of the brain. One very remarkable instance is given by Morgagni. " A fisherman of Venice, upwards of forty years of age, and the subject of dyspepsia, was seized when in his boat with an affection of the abdomen, apparently from flatulence, to which he had been previously liable, and sud- denly expired.'' '*"The body was examined on the follow- ing day. Dissection.—The abdomen was tumid from gas, with which the stomach and intestines were inflated." " The heart was large and flaccid ; and both of the ven- tricles, and the right auricle, contained frothy blood." Most of the veins, the pulmonary artery, the aorta and carotids, also contained a frothy mixture of air and blood. The scrotum was greatly inflated with air.* Pechlin gives a case of a somewhat similar nature,-f- upon which Nysten remarks—" On reconnoit que la mort doit etre speciale- ment rapportee a la distension du ventricle pulmonaire par un gaz qui empechoit le sang venieux d'y arriver.*"!jl Uil'- fortunately the symptoms which immediately preceded death are not detailed. Ruysch gives an account of a woman who died suddenly, and in whom the heart was found distended with air.§ A similar case is described by Graetz, and is quoted by Morgagni (Lib. i. ep. v. § 20.) and Nysten, (p. 7, and p. 174.) The following are perhaps two of the most important of these cases of which we have any account. The one is given • Cooke's Morgagni, vol. i. p. 80. Lend. 1832 from Morgagni, v. 17. •f Observ.

33 and I see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the results of the former part of it, we need, I ap- prehend, no further proof of the decided part taken by the nerves in the process of secretion. I have hitherto purposely avoided all reference to that theory which has been advocated by Dr Wilson Philip, of the identity of the nervous influence and galvanism, which, though one of an unusually interesting nature, could not have been introduced here, without increasing the thesis to an unwar- rantable length. Moreover, the two questions, viz. that which forms the subject of this paper, and the one to which allusion has just been made, are, I consider, perfectly distinct, at any rate in the state in which the latter at present exists. If, however, that identity should in process of time be satisfactorily proved, then these experi- ments, in which secretion, already suspended by the destruction of the nervous communications, was found to be re-established by galvanism transmitted along the divided nerves of the organ, will come to be powerful arguments on this side of the question. As, however, I have not been able to find sufficient data for the establishment of this fact, and for the reasons above-mentioned, I consider myself justified in having omitted a more lengthened detail of them. Itnow remains forme to state the opinions which I have been led to entertain by the study of this subject; but the previous observations contained in c

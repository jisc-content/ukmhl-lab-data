25 a thickening of the coats of the vein, or from other causes afterwards to be stated, the vessels were unable to collapse; and if thus kept in a patulous state, it is easy to conceive how rapidly the right side of the heart would become dis- tended with air; for it is clear, that when a vessel in such a state is cut across, air, and air only, would pass down it. The effect produced when great force is used in blowing, is well illustrated by the experiment upon a dog, mentioned in the first chapter, (p. 13.) In that case, the right side of the heart was suddenly and violently distended with air, and death took place with the greatest conceivable rapidity. It was probably owing to the great force used, that the following experiment proved fatal; for certainly the small quantity of air injected was not of itself sufficient to pro- duce the result. M. Bassereaux, when assisting Dr. Bre- tonneaux to inject pus into the jugular veins of dogs, hap- pened upon one occasion, imperfectly to fill the syringe. The canula was introduced into the vein, and the piston pressed down ; but before the liquid had entered the circula- tion, (and dissection shewed that not a drop of pus had been injected) both gentlemen heard a distinct " gargouille- menty The experiment was instantly stopped, and in half a minute the animal fell down on its side, in strong convul- sions. The respiration was laboured and stertorous, and death took place in two minutes. Upon dissection, only a few bubbles of air were found in the right auricle, which was almost entirely gorged with blood. The principal ob- ject of mentioning this case is, that unless explained in some such way as has now been done, it might possibly be adduced in favour of the doctrine of Bichat. 3(/, The only other modifying circumstance proposed for

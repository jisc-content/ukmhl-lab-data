5 gist arrived at the conclusion to which Nysten so long after- wards came, viz. that the circulation is arrested in the heart. Langrish, ujjon opening the thorax of a dog, which he had killed in a few seconds by " propelling sulphurous air towards the heart " through the jugular vein, found, the right auricle and ventricle greatly distended with air and almost destitute of blood. The cavities of the left side wero collapsed. Believing " that the death of the dog was owing to the resistance which the air gave to the return of the blood through the venae cavae, and not to any particular action of the sulphureous fumes on the blood itself," he threw a similar quantity of pure air into the jugular vein of another dog, and found that death ensued as suddenly as in the previous case.* As there is no account given of the post mortem appearances, we may conclude that they were similar to those found in the first experiment. In more recent times the subject has been investigated by Bichat, Magendie, Nysten, Piednagel, Leroy, Wing, and others. There is a great deal of discrepancy of opinion among these authors, and we shall now examine the respective merits of the various theories which they have propounded, Bichat believed that death was occasioned by the contact of air with the brain ; Nysten maintains that the arrest- ment of the vital functions depends upon the distension of the right side of the heart with air—that death commences at the right side, and that the cessation of the contractions of the left is a secondary result. Leroy at one time sup- posed that emphysema of the lungs is the sole cause of death ; but he afterwards modified this opinion, and sug- • Pliysiciil Experiments upon Brutes, p. 152. Lond. 1740.

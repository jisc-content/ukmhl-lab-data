INTRODUCTION. The amount of physiological knowledge derived from ex- periments on the inferior animals, would unquestionably have been more extended and accurate than it really is, had experimenters been more desirous to give exact accounts of what they saw, and less anxious to form ingenious hypo- theses, and hasty generalizations of facts. It is to be la- mented, that this itching after novelty has led some most distinguished men to commit another and a much more se- rious error than that to which reference has now been made â€”I allude to a practice with which the French in particu- lar are chargeable, viz. that of describing their experiments in inflated language, using fanciful and exaggerated expres- sions in recording the effects of the various physiological agents they have employed; thus rendering their observa- tions in a great measure useless, indeed in some cases it may be, worse than useless. Much unnecessary slaughter of animals might certainly be avoided, were experimenters more careful to record their observations in that plain unvarnished language, which alone n

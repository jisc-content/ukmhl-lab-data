In bringing this essay to its con- clusion, I will first state some of the arguments by which it is determined that secretion is, in any degree, under the influence of the nervous system, and next examine the extent to which this influ- ence is exerted. I have only to mention the effects of violent mental affections on the various secretions,—as of grief on that of the tears, of fear on that of the perspiration and urine, of the stimulus of savoury odours on the flow of saliva, and lastly, of the in- creased production of milk in the female breast on the sight of her infant,—to convince the most scep- tical that the different processes, by which these fluids are produced, are liable to suffer changes from the action of the nervous system. If these will not suffice, I refer to the results of some of those experiments first mentioned in this essay, which, though I have already deemed insufiicient to determine the more difficult part of our enquiry, furnish,Iimagine,inthemselves abundant evidence that my conclusions in this particular are not in- correct. But it is almost superfluous to proceed further in arguing this part of the question, as I scarcely anticipate that any material objection can be raised against the view I have here taken. Those authors who are quite decided in their dis- belief of the necessity of the nervous power in se-

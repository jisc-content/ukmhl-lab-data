His friend, Augustus Schultze, Professor of Physiology in the University of Fri- burg, found precisely opposite results in similar ex- periments, for, according to his account, the pro- cess of digestion was, not only not interrupted, hut even performed with greater rapidity, f Messrs Leuret and Lassaigne object strongly to any experiment in which the abdomen or chest is opened, as, from the severity of the operation, no precise results can be obtained. Their first trial ws upon a horse, in i whose neck they di- vided these nerves. Digestion was suspended, but this they attribute to the: inflammation of the sto- mach which ensued in-this case, as in some future experiments the food was found perfectly digested. Analysis shewed the chyme and chyle formed to be similar to that under, ordinary circumstances. A great number of gentlemen witnessed these ex- periments, and were convinced of the accuracy of the i;esults,5.am2,i^g,\v^o^ was M.

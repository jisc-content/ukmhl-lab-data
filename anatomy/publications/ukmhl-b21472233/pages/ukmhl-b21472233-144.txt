52 to favour the opinion, that the internal coat of an artery has the power of secreting air. That such is the case we are inclined to believe ; and to prevent repetition, the arguments upon which this opinion is founded are here summed up. 1st, Air is found circu- lating in the vessels along with the blood in certain cold^^ blooded animals. 2d, Air has been found unmixed with the blood in the human species after death, when from the . history of the case there is every reason to suppose that it was in the blood-vessels during life. Air is secreted by serous membranes, to which the inner coat of an artery bears a close resemblance ; and this, when viewed in connexion with the experiments of Krimer, is an argument of considerable weight.* Another argument might be drawn from these cases of sudden death, in which the only thing found which can at all explain this event, is the presence of a large quantity of aii; in the blood-vessels. Sometimes the gaseous matter is found only in the vessels of the brain, and to this class of cases Morgagni has given the name of gaseous apoplexy. At other times we find the heart distended with frothy blood. From what has been stated above, it is fair to enter- tain the idea, that the sudden evolution of air within the blood-vessels may occasionally give rise to symptoms similar to those produced by its injection into the veins. This hy- pothesis is strengthened by the fact, that the formation of air in the living body sometimes takes place with extreme rapidity. Cases of Sudden death, in which the heart is described as â€¢ In Burdiich, vol. v. p. 209. is the absurd fancy that air is naturally secreted in the heart and origin of the large vessels, because they empty themselves of their blood without being able to remain collapsed.

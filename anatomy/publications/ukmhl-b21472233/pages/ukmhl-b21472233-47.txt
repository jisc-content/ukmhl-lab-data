7 from paralysis of the laryngeal muscles supplied by the recurrent branch of the par vagum. The experiments and observations of Le Gal- lois * on the division of this nerve were princi- pally made in regard to the changes produced on the respiration. He, however, appears to believe, that digestion is suspended, and that if death did not take place from other causes, the derange- ment produced in the exercise of this function would be sufficient to produce that event. Sir B. Brodie, in endeavouring to investigate this subject expei imentally,found, from the speedy death caused by the division of the eighth pair in the neck interrupting the respiratory functions, that it was necessary to avoid, by some means or other, this source of fallacy. He had previously ascertained, that when a dog was poisoned with arsenic, a considerable effusion of fluid was found .always in the stomach. He accordingly admini- stered some of the deleterious drug to an animal, and also introduced some into a wound made in the thigh, and afterwards, in both cases, divided the branches of the par vagum upon the oesopha- gus, just as they pass from it, upon the surface of the stomach. In these cases, the breathing M'^as not in the slightest degree altered from the natu- ral state, and the poison took effect with the usu- al phenomena, excepting the secretion of the fluid, which was entirely wanting.

On dissection, eight hours after death, the surface of the body was found soiled by blood which had transuded through the integuments, and some blood had also been discharged from the nose. The whole body was emphysematous, but the left inferior extremity was so to a very high degree. It was double its natural size, of a brown colour, and covered with numerous phlycteuEe, some black, of great extent, and collected in clusters, from which escaped a reddish serous fluid, mingled with a quantity of gas; others white, from which nothing but air escaped. When the limb was pressed with the hand, crepitation was distinctly heard, the abdomen was much distended with gas, and in the intestines were observed those alterations which are so common in cases of typhus fever. Bubbles of air filled the vessels of the pia mater and the left vena saphena. The lymphatic ganglions of the mesentery were enlarged, and contained gas, which took fire from the flame of a taper, and produced an explosion ; the same phenomena also fol- lowed the exit of the air, which was contained in the legs, thighs, and scrotum."* Weber mentions a case of aneu- rism containing air.-j- According to the experiments of Krimer it appears, that if the blood be pressed out of a portion of an artery, and that portion be isolated by two ligatures, it will soon become dis^ tended with air.j If this statement be correct, it seems • Lond.

14 M. Brachet, in a great number of experiments, performed on various animals, and related in his late work on the ganglionic system, confirms the above observation in every respect ; but whilst he believes the secretion to be under the immedi- ate power of the nervous system, yet he does not allow this to the par vagum, but ascribes to it, amongst numerous other offices, that of presiding over the motions of the organ.* In estimating the value of these expei'iments in regard to the question under consideration, and of the conclusion which may be drawn from them, numerous difficulties obstruct that simpli- city of deduction which all positive physiological inferences require. There are three separate func- tions which the par vagum may discharge in its distribution on the stomach. It may alone be of use in influencing or regulating the secretion of the gastric juice; on it may depend those sensa- tions with which physiologists state the organ to be endowed ; or lastly, its office may be to call into action the peristaltic movements of the viscus. And I find, in the various authors whom I have consulted, these three different theories advocated, in explanation of the suspension of the digestive function, which now, from the numerous experi- ments recorded in proof of the fact, must, I think, be allowed, by all candid enquirers, to be the con- * Recherches experimentales sur les t'onctions du systerae ner, veux gang^lionaire.

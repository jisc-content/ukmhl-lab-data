Diurnal Revolutions of the Pulse. 19 TABLE Sliewing the different states of the pulse, as reckoned at three different periods of the day, viz. after breakfast, dinner, and supper. The experiment was made during summer. After dinner, before 5, p. M. After breakfast, always before 10, a. m. Evening, between 10 and 12, p. m. geaerally near 12.

The conclusions to be drawn from this table are obvious. To render them still more so, I may observe, that the breakfast is generally a moderate one, consisting of coffee, bread, and eggs; the dinner always of animal food principally, and a small quantity of vegetables ; to which was often added a little spirits or porter; and, notwithstanding the vast difference between the stimulating powers of these two meals, the morning pulse is inferior to the one after dinner by only two beats; the dif- ference would have been ten or fifteen, had the case been reversed, at least I am induced to think so from some experi- ments which I afterwards instituted directly to ascertain the f)oint. In the evening the pulse was reckoned after supper, ight, indeed, but certainly equal to the breakfast in stimulant power, and in some measure more so, because spirituous liquors very generally supplied the place of coffee. Notwithstanding this, the evening pulse is found to be, on an average, nearly eight beats lower than the morning one; a difference by no means inconsiderable, and sufficiently warranting the conclusions I have drawn from it. The following tabic was drawn up, in order to ascertain the

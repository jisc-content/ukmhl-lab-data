31 of death till the seventh day was owing to the small quan- tity of air admitted during the operation, or to a fresh quantity having got in immediately before death, owing to the inferior opening of the vessel still remaining gaping on the surface of the wound. He conceives that the frothy serum found in the bronchial cells, and the emphysematous spots noticed under the pulmonary pleura, render the latter supposition plausible, but even granting that the emphyse- ma was produced by the air which entered the wounded vein, it is just as likely to have been caused at the operation as afterwards, and as for the frothy serum, it is by no means an unusual post mortem appearance in most diseases. The absence of the laboured breathing and other characteristic phenomena described as ushering in death, from the admis- sion of air into the veins, throws a good deal of obscurity over the nature of the case, and appears to render it highly probable that there were some causes operating which do not appear in the narrative. Might not the oppression and coma depend on something quite different from air in the circulation, such as phlebitis, or inflammation of some important organ ? Be that as it may, the air might have entered, owing to the slipping of the bandages, immediately before, or to a certain extent during the death struggles. It appears, at all events, that although sudden death does not follow the admission of air, and immediate danger be averted, there are disasters still to be dreaded, the most im- portant of which are inflammation of the lungs, and the admission of more air, to which may perhaps also be added the danger of phlebitis, in consequence of the injury done to the vein in the operation, or owing to the violence of the measures adopted to prevent immediate death.

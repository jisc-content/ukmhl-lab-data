23 1st, That the result is modified to a very great extent by the quantity of air admitted, it is unnecessary to insist upon at any length. The experiments of Nysten, Magendie, Wing, and others, clearly shew that it is only when intro- duced in considerable quantity that there is a fatal issue. This I have satisfied myself of by repeated experiments. The same fact has also been stated by Dr. Blundel, in his memoir on the transfusion of blood. It is probable that when slowly introduced, the oxygen is either in whole or in part absorbed, and the volume of the elastic fluid thus ma- terially diminished. That such absorption does really take place there can be no doubt, for the experiments of Dr. Christison distinctly prove that the oxygenation of the blood is a purely chemical process, and that even out of the body venous blood absorbs a large quantity of oxygen, and changes its purple for a florid hue.* Nysten infers from various experiments that some of the injected gas may be thrown oflp by the lungs. It appears, however, that a large quantity of air may enter the heart, and nevertheless no such phenomena be manifested, as took place in those cases and experiments already detailed. This statement is founded upon the fol- lowing Experiment. Six or seven full expirations were injected through a small tube into the jugular veins of two dogs. A little difficulty of breathing ensued, but this soon passed away. At the end of half an hour the animals were killed, having up to that time seemed pretty lively, and exhibited t Edinb.

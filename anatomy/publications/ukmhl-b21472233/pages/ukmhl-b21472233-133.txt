41 in general, the method recommended, if promptly had recourse to, and judiciously conducted, will prove successful. I think the experiment more generally succeeds when, along with the air, a considerable quantity of blood is eva- cuated. In support of this opinion, the following case is subjoined : When Bouley Junior, veterinary surgeon at Paris, was bleeding a horse for pneumonia, having ceased to compress the vein, he heard a peculiar sound, which, how- ever, did not particularly attract his attention, as he had on former occasions remarked a similar occurrence. The oper- ation was concluded, and the animal sent back to the stable, where it was immediately seized with general trembling. Respiration became laboured and plaintive, the pulse small, irregular, and very quick; and then we are told, that groaning deeply, he fell down as if struck by a thunder bolt. For sometime Bouley was unable to account for these symp- toms ; but upon recollecting the sound which was heard when he relinquished his pressure of the vein, he concluded that it might be owing to the entrance of air. Under this impression, the vein was caused to bleed afresh. As the blood flowed the animal revived; and in half an hour after the accident, he was restored to the state in which he was prior to the operation, and in three days resumed his usual work. Magendie states, that an analogous case happened to Girard at the veterinary school of Alfort.* The advantage which resulted from the loss of blood in this case is very obvious; and may not recovery in the following instance be traced to a similar cause ?

13 fessed the error of his previously published obser- vations. They conclude that digestion can be completed independently of the par vagum.* Dr Ware, in some experiments intended to prove the inaccuracy of Dr Wilson Philip's theory of the identity of the nervous influence and galvanism, found that, on dividing the eighth pair, digestion was entirely suspended.f'""i "^o yMvr^ -^i- -\o ^l.tM To conclude the notice of this class of experi- ments I may briefly mention some which I per- formed myself during the'"last-summer. They corroborate those which have been already noticed, whiere"the'suspension of the digestive functions was the result obtained. After the operation the animals were always allowed to' M-^e'for a time, suflSciently long fur digestion, under oi'dinary cir- cumstances, to have proceeded some length. Little pain was manifested during this time. Diflficulty of breathing was often, though not invariably, considerable, and the effusion of fluid into the bron- chi moderate. Other rabbits, for these were the animals made use of, werealways kept for compari- son, placed under precisely the same circumstances, excepting the division of the nerves, which obviat- ed in a great measure the objection urged by some, that the pain of the operation is at any time suffi- cient to suspend digestion.]: * Recherches Physiologiques'dt 'Chimiques'pbtfr' servir a I'Histoire de la Digestion, f London Medical and Surgical'ioWnaV'i'^ol. i.

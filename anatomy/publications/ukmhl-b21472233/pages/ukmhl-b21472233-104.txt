12 frothy blood. The froth was not nearly of so light a con- sistence as in the former experiment, owing probably to the blood and air not having had sufficient time to be tho- roughly agitated together. The left side of the heart cott- tained fluid blood. It is worthy of remark, that the irrita- bility of the heart was almost extinct. Even though rapidly relieved of its load of blood and air, the contractions ex- cited by pricking it with the knife were unusually trifling. In the horse again, the contractions of the heart continued very forcible long after it had been cut out of the body. The lungs were next examined, and were found to be quite healthy. They were collapsed, and in no degree emphyse- matous. In the vena cava and some of the larger abdomi- nal veins, bubbles of air were observed, but in most of the other vessels examined, none could be detected.* Since in both of these experiments, the structure of the lungs was in no degree broken up, we must refer the cause of death either to the heart or to the brain. Now, in both in- stances, the convulsions indicating an affection of the brain, appear to havebeen secondary results, andtheimmediatecause of death, the stoppage or derangement of the heart's action, in consequence of an over distension of its walls. It is pro- bably in the agonies of death, and in those cases where the heart's action at that time becomes quickened, or, as is frequently the case, assumes an irregular or vermicular movement, that the frothing of the blood takes place. The appearance is by no means uniform, and I have seen the blood and air wholly unmixed. The following experiment shews, that air may be thrown â€¢ My frientl Mr. Tlioraas R.

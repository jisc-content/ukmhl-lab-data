6 gested the three following ways in which death may take place from the introduction of air into the veins : 1st, By affecting the sensibility of the brain, or by acting mechani- cally upon that organ : 2d, By producing sudden emphys- ema of the lungs : and, lastly. By depriving the heart of arterial blood. Piednagel conceives that a change in the structure of the lungs is the principal cause of death.* Magendie at one time held that emphysema of the lungs was one of the causes of death ; but as he does not allude to it in the most recent publication where he notices this sub- ject, it seems probable that he now agrees with Nysten, es-' pecially as he brings forward nothing but what indicates such an acquiescence. The opinion of Bichat, that the air acts as a poison on the brain, appears to have been the result of hasty or inaccu- rate observation ; an opinion which we seem fully warrant- ied in expressing, when we find this distinguished physio- logist stating so egregious an error as that a single bubble of air produces an instantaneously fatal result. This theory is based upon the following facts and observations: 1st, The circulation goes on for some time after the intro- duction of air into the veins : 2d, Air propelled upon the brain through one of the carotids causes death : 3d, Con- vulsions precede death : 4th, The venous capillaries are full of blood mixed with air; and, fifthly. He considers the cases of sudden death mentioned by Morgagni, in which air was found in the vessels of the brain, as strengthening his theory. Subsequent inquiries appear to give almost no support to â€¢ Joui n. de Physiol. Tome ix p. 70, ct seq

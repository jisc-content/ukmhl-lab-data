33 The patulous state of the vein may depend on two causes :â€”Ist, The vessel may be gaping in consequence of a rigidity of the coats caused by disease; or, 2rad, It may be kept open by the constrained position of the pa- tient, or the manipulations of the operator and his assistants. M. Berard, I am aware, ascribes the phenomenon chiefly to the anatomical peculiarities of the vessels, independent of disease.* He has shewn that the large veins near the heart have fasciae closely adherent to their coats, and that these fasciae are attached to bones. This connexion, he be- lieves, is of such a nature as to prevent the collapse of the veins. One decided objection to this explanation is, that the entrance of air by no means always follows a wound of these vessels ; and seeing that the admission of air is not a necessary consequence of a wound of a vein provided with such a fascia, how can it be established that this fascia is in any one instance the cause of the entrance of air ? The anatomical facts, then, pointed out by Berard cannot be regarded as at all explaining why veins sometimes remain uncoUapsed, in spite of the suction power of the heart and chest, and the influence of atmospheric pressure; but they may, however, be viewed as to a certain extent favouring the occurrence of the phenomenon. It is not, however, only by the great vessels in the neck that air has been known to get in. Air entered the saphena of a patient upon whom Dupuytren was operating; and when Clemot was removing a tumour from the breast of a female, it entered a divided vein, and in consequence of this, the woman died a few hours after the operation.

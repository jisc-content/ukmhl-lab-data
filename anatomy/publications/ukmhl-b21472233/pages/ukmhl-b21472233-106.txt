14 physema, and it may be added as a ciicumstancc worthy of note, that there was but little frothy blood in the pul- monary artery.* The phenomena both before and after death described as having been seen in those individuals who have died sud- denly on the operating table, owing to the accidental ad- mission of air, fully bear out the views now stated. The first case of the kind which attracted general attention, happened in Paris in 1818. It is particularly interesting and valuable, from the circumstance that the appearances detected on dissection were quite different from those ex- pected :—the belief being that the right sac of the pleura would be found full of air. Beauchere was removing a tumour from the right shoulder. When detaching the last adherent portion with the bistoury, a peculiar sound was suddenly heard, similar to that caused by the entrance of air through a small open- ing into the thorax of a living animal. It was the opinion of all present that the pleura had been wounded. The pa- tient exclaimed, " mon sang tombe dans mon cocur ! jc suis mortr—he became pale, his head fell backwards, the eyes were fixed, and he could not distinguish objects. Respiration was easy but loud, and seemed to be performed chiefly by the left lung ; the movementson the right side of the chest being very ' • One not acquainted with the appearance usually presented by the lungs of rabbits, might easily suppose that there was emphysema when that organ was nevertheless in its ordinary condition. For what seems to be the healthy state of the rabbit's lungs bears a very close resemblance to emphysema in the human subject. It is therefore not so satisfactory to make this experiment on a rabbit. In the above experiment I was assist- ed by my friends Messrs. Thomas R. Scott, and William Scott.

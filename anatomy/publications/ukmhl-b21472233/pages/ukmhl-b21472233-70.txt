30 ly formed before any of the fluid which afterward circulates in them can be accurately observed. But I have ari'ived at that part of my essay, where I think it requisite to sum up the argu- ments, which appear to conduce to the establish- ment of the nervous theory of secretion, as it has been denominated by Bostock. Bordeu affirms that the number of nerves usually distributed to glands are moi*e than sufficient to ensure the life of the part; neither, says he, are these organs very sensitive, nor are they endowed with motion, yet, allowing that some are required for each of these purposes, several remain to answer some other end, " and are they not employed in secretion ?"* Though this manner of stating his argument may be considered as very ingenious, ra- ther than strictly correct, yet I am inclined to at- tach some weight to the anatomical distribution of the nerves in favour of this theory. It is general- ly allowed by physiologists, that the secretions are performed by the minute arterial, and not by the venous capillaries. Now, anatomists inform us that arteries and excretory tubes, to their mi- nutest ramifications, are abundantly supplied with nervous branches, particularly of the sympathetic system, whilst they do not appear to be so connect- ed with the veins, f What, then, can be the use * Recherches Auatomiques sur les Glandes, p.

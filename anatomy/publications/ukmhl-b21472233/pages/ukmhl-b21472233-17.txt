Diurnal Bevolutions of the Pulse. 17 be distinctly perceived the limits to which we should wish to extend these doctrines. The variation in different individuals inust necessarily be immense;â€”for that the candid will make proper allowance. Dr Gullen (whose name is not merely celebrated, but vene- rated in medical science) talked of a natural accelei^tion of the pulse, which, according to him, happens twice a-day, and resembles, in a distant manner, a febrile paroxysm. Now, amidst many hundred experiments, performed under a great variety of circumstances, I could never perceive any such phe- nomenon. The time of the day at which the first spontaneous acceleration is supposed to happen, is noon. My own pulse never shewed any symptoms of such acceleration, but, on the contrary, always diminished in velocity. Thus, Ex. 11, A.M. . . Pulse 72 12, noon, .... 71 1, P.M. ... 63 Half past 1, P.M. . . 64 The other paroxysm, according to the same author, occurs in the afternoon, and that, too, totally independent of any excite- ment by food, &c. This opinion is equally erroneous with tlie former. Ex. S, p. M. Pulse 68 4, . .66 5, . .64 6, . .62 Ex. Half past 3, p. m. Pulse 67 Half past 4, p. m. 67 5, p. M. . . 64 Half past 5, . .63 6, p.

Perhaps the following instances, taken at random from a great number of others, may go far to settle the point. In the

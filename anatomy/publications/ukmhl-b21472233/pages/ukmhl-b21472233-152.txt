4 Thennometric Tables^ Sfc. 3. Convert —9.6K. into degrees of Fahr. and Cent.: —9R. =+U.75F. —11.23 C. —0.6 = _ 1.35 _ 0.75 —9.6 R. = + 10.40 F. —12.00 C. If the })i oposed quantity extends to hundredths or thou.sandths oCa degree, it may be converted by shifting the decimal point of the proportional part either one or two places to the left. I''or example: 1. Coprort + 52.246 G. into degrees of Fahr. and Reaum.: + 52 C. - 125.6 F. 41.6 R. + 0.2 = 0.36 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.072 0.032 + 0.006 = 0.01OG 0.0048 + 52.246 C. = 126.0428 F. 41.7968 R.

By these tables a conversion may be made at a half or third of any of the num- bers, by doubling or trebling the given quantity, and then a half or third of the result, will be the quantity required. Tables VII. to XIV. Are for converting the difTerent French and English measures into one another, and are used in the same manner as tlie prr- (■eHing,

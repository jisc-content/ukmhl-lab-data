17 the artificial respiration had recourse to. It is almost iiii'- possible to perform this process, without to a greater or less extent breaking up the air cells. Both in my own hands and in others more expert, I have uniformly seen some amount of emphysema produced when endeavours were made to recover animals by means of artificial respiration. Perhaps it is from serious injury being done to the lungs, that so few infants resuscitated by this method survive more than-a few days ; and there is much reason to fear, that the rude apparatus frequently employed by unskilful persons for the recovery of those apparently drowned, is the cause of so little advantage being derived from artificial respiration in such cases. The following case may be classed along with those of Beauchere and Dupuytren already described. When Mr. Barlow of Blackburn, Lancashire, was removing a tumour from the side of the neck of a delicate lady, and was " pro-i ceeding to dissect aside the skin to get at the basis of the tumour, a sudden and unexpected hissing gurgling noise rushed obviously from a large divided empty vein, and the patient expired instantly, without either sigh, groan, or struggle, and every effort to restore animation was fruit- less. This unexpected event," Mr. Barlow goes on to re- mark, " was truly appalling to all present, for scarcely an ounce of blood was lost on the occasion, and her death was then wholly attributed to a state of debility and syncope, which opinion I acknowledge remained unchanged till I accidentally met with the case of Dupuytren,"* A fatal case of a similar nature occurred to Dr. Warren of Harward University, when removing a cancerous mam- â€¢ Med.

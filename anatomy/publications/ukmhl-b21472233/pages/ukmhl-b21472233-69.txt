Instances are also recorded where? in complete paralysis of the lower half of the body, erectionand ejaculationof the semen have occurred; and Bichat, when arguing this point, relates the case of an individual in this state having contract- ed a gonorrhoea. But what do these instances prove ? Certainly nothing for the purpose they are intended. To do this it must be allowed that all nervous power was suspended ; but the very fact of the venereal appetite existing at all, and influencing the generative organs, denies that this could ha^'e been the case. The progress of the formation of the chick in ovo, has yielded also a very formidable objection against the nervous theory of secretion. It is stated that the secretory processes " go on in the chick before any vestige of brain or spinal marrow can be traced, as also in the early part of the existence of the human foetus, when the brain and nerves appear incapable of performing their func- tions."* I, however, apprehend that this argument will, in a great measure, be deprived of its weight, when it is remembered that, if allowed, it must like- wise be admitted in regard to the formation of the various parts of the animal from the blood ; for it is ascertained that the blood-vessels are distinct- * Alison, in Journal of Science, Vol. ix.

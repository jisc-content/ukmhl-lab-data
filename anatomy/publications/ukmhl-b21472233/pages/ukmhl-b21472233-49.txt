9 and intestines, are wholly independent of the ner- vous system. From the experiments of Dr Hast- ings, conducted under his (Dr Philip's) own in- spection, (and published also separately by Dr H. himself,*) he concludes that when the par vagum is divided, the digestion of food is suspended, and that this arises from the non-secretion of the gas- tric juice. He states that when the division was made below the situation where the recurrent branch is given off, the difficulty of breathing did not supervene so rapidly as when made above. Rabbits were usually made the subject of these operations, two being employed for the purpose; one for comparison, which was always placed in the same situation as the other, excepting as regards the injury of the nerves. The one was killed upon the death of the other, and the respective states of their stomachs compared. Efforts to vomit always occurred sooner or later during the experi- ments. In those animals which were fed after the operation, it ensued immediately, whilst in those M'hich had eaten previously, the consequence Was delayed until sometime afterwards. This he considers as a powerful argument in his favour. For in the first case, says he, the intet^ nal coat of the stomach is not defended from th6 irritation of the crude food by the proper secre- tion which would convert the surface of the ali- mentary mass into chyme; whilst in the latter, • ■ , I •ii <i'--;ii;!

47 In many animals air is an ordinary and natural secretion. Such is the gaseous matter contained in the swimming bladder oF the fish ; but what is more to our purpose, in many of the cold-blooded animals, air appears to circulate along with the blood. Reichel frequently observed globules of air in the blood of frogs ;* and Spallanzani saw the same in that of salamanders.-}- Blumenbach states that he has seen air vesicles so frequently in the blood of amphibia, and fishes, that he considers them to be constantly present.;]: Similar observations have been made by Redi, Caldesi, and Morgagni.§ Anormal formations of air are by no means uncommon, both in the inferior animals and in the human subject, in certain states of disease, and they sometimes exist without any other morbid phenomena being apparent. Bags con- taining air have been found in the abdominal cavities of healthy pigs ; and occasionally air is contained in cysts in the human subject. || In hysteria, air frequently accumulates in very large quantities in the stomach and intestines; and in peritonitis the formation of gaseous matter is a common occurrence. disease was cholera. In consequence of the injection of the saline solu- tion, phlebitis supervened. During life it was suspected that within the cavity of both knee joints there was accumulated a mixture of air and pus, and upon dissection a few hours after death, such was proved to be the case. In this instance, however, it is probable that the gaseous mat- ter was produced by the decomposition of the pus. • De Sanguine motu experimenta, p. 16.

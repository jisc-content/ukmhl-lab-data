40 is, it must be done immediately and thoroughly. Nystere says, that he recovered two dogs from a moribund condition, by forcing the air out of the heart, through an opening in the jugular vein, by means of pressure on the thorax. This is certainly a very clumsy mode of proceeding, and I should, think, even in dogs, not always likely to succeed. At all events, in the human subject, such a method could be of little or no avail. The recommendation here given, (which- is also that of Magendie,) is certainly that which the ope- rator ought, if possible, to follow when the untoward acci- dents occur, of which frequent mention has already been made. Magendie recommends the air to be drawn from the heart by applying the mouth to the divided vessel, or,, by pumping it out with a syringe, if that instrument should happen to be within reach.* It is evident that the surgeon ought not, even for a few seconds, to delay his attempts to relieve the heart; and that, consequently, in most cases, he will, if he is anxious to proceed with the necessary expedition, have recourse to sucking with his mouth. Though convinced of the advantage which results, in the majority of cases, from the removal of the air from the heart, I must admit that in a few instances, my attempts to recover animals in this way proved abortive. This ought, probably, to be attributed to too large a quantity of air having been introduced, or to some other accidental cir- cumstance, producing a state beyond that of imminent dan- ger, from which it was possible to relieve the animal. In spite of these unsuccessful efforts at resuscitation, I can confidently state, as a fair deduction from experiments, that â€¢ Lemons de la vie, p. CO. A Paris, 1836.

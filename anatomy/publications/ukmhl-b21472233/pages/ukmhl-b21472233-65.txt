25 allow, that, if all were perfectly agreed as to its correctness as an ascertained fact, the question might be considered as decided. It is stated that in a considerable number of the lower animals, and in the entire vegetable kingdom, no traces of a nervous system have hitherto been discovered by the most minute anatomical investigations. Thus Bostock declares that, if a good instance of secretion, performed in animals where a nervous system has not hitherto been detected, can be fur- nished, the controversy is at once decided. If then this distinguished physiologist had followed out this line of argument, used in the former, and still adopted in the later edition of his work, and had cited an instance of this kind, his choice might probably have fallen upon some one of those ani- mals in which a nervous system, truly of a more simple character, has lately been discovered. For since the time when this argument was first ad- vanced, nerves have been distinctly detected in some classes of animals where their existence was not previously suspected, which circumstance proves at once that the controversy considered in this manner is any thing but decided. To this, however, it may be replied, that many still exist to which the remark of Bostock strictly applies; but as we have seen patient and successful inves- tigation overcoming in a great measure this powerful barrier, and, arguing from the uniformi- ty invariably observed by nature in all her works,

When the spinal chord was destroy- ed from the place of section, above-mentioned, to the sacrum, little change was observed, but when the destruction was carried further up into the medulla oblongata, respiration instantly ceas- ed, and, although artificially carried on for thirteen minutes, no secretion was formed. The brain was next gradually removed, and here likewise the se- cretion was not affected. Immediately, however, on the medulla oblongata being injured, respira- tion ceased, and although this function was again artificially maintained, the same result as before mentioned occurred.* Brodie informs us that, on removing the brain, the secretion of urine was suspended, although ar- tificial respiration was maintained. In repeating the experiment he found the same result, together with a considerable reduction of the animal heat. He concludes, that, when the influence of the brain is cut off, the secretion is arrested, as also the for- mation of animal heat, notwithstanding that the usual chaiiges in the appearance of the blood are effected by I'espiration.f Westrumb relates three experiments which ap- pear to have been carefully performed. He divid- ed the spinal marrow at the first vertebra, and maintained artificial respiration, by which means the temperature of the body was kept at the na- ♦ Dissertatio Inaug. circa urinae secretioneni, Halae, 1818. -(■ Croomiian Lecture, Philosophical Transactions, 1812.

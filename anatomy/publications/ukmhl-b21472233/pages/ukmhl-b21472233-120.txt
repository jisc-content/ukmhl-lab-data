28 appearances described, the examination having been made two hours after death. The pleuree presented their natural appearance, but the lungs were of a greyish colour, mixed with brown spots, somewhat gorged with blood, and much distended with frothy mucus. There was not a single bubble of air in the heart, nor in any of the blood vessels. Both ventricles contained blood, and in these cavities there were small yellow semi-transparent concretions. Nysten ob- served a similar state of the lungs in repeated experiments of the same nature.* I was anxious to verify these experiments of Nysten, but was never lucky enough to obtain a case at all resembling those which he details as perishing from secondary thoracic symptoms, though I had several instances of spontaneous re- storation to health, after the injection of a large quantity of air. There was one rabbit in which I fully anticipated something such as he describes, but complete and speedy recovery took place. This is an account of the Experiment.—A large quantity of air was injected into the jugular vein. Very violent effects were produced, so violent indeed, that the animal seemed for twenty minutes to be in a moribund, or at least in a very critical state. To our astonishment, however, it gradually came round, and in about an hour the respiration, which was at first very la- boured, became tolerably natural, and the rabbit was soon little out of sorts. In a few hours afterwards the breathing, as far as I could judge, was quite natural, and the animal ate food with avidity. I kept it for sixteen days, and never observed anything wrong, excepting an abscess which formed in the seat of the operation. • Nysten, op, cit. p. 36, &c.

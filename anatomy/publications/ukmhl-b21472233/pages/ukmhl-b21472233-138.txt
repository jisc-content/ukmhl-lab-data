De Boisement, in his excellent Thesis on Pneumatoses,* mentions a case of gaseous matter being formed within the synovial membrane of the knee joint, and from the analogy between synovial and serous membranes, it is curious that no similar case (as far as I can discover) should be on record. • Recberches sur les Pneumatoses, par A.

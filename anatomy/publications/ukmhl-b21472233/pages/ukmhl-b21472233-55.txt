IS sequence of division of these nerves. To fix upon the correct one of these three theories constitutes not a slight portion of the difficulties of the sub- ject, for if we agree with those who are inclined to admit the first hypothesis, the question is im- mediately asked, how it happens that, whilst this secretion is suspended, that of the mucus of the lungs is so greatly increased ? and does it not ap- pear strange, that from the same cause two such decidedly opposite consequences should arise? We shall be told likewise, by those advocating the third theory mentioned, that for a certain time the secretion does go forwards, as is proved by the existence of a layer of chyme on the surface of the alimentary matter, which, say they, would be con- tinued, did not the paralysis of the organ prevent the application of fresh unchanged food to the se- creting surface. As to the first of these objections, although it is stated, by almost all experimenters on the subject, to be the fact that the secretion from the internal mucous surface of the air-pas- sages is much increased, and though not prepared positively to deny it, yet I am inclined to think, from my own observation, that this is more appa- rent than real. The deception arises, I imagine, from the air breathed being mixed, by the violent respiratory efforts, with the fluid already there, thus giving it a frothy appearance, which might easily be mistaken for augmentation of its quantity. In confirmation of this idea I have found that when

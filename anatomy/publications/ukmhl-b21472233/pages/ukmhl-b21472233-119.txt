27 could be obtained, I was not long in perceiving the neces- sity of (in the meantime at least) abandoning this part ol" the investigation. But this was done with less reluctance, as the point did not appear to be of very essential import- ance, and seemed to be one which, whatever trouble might be bestowed upon it, could after all only be elucidated to a certain extent. Very violent effects may be produced by the injection of air into a vein, and yet the animal operated upon may spontaneously recover. For example, Dr. Wing threw by degrees a considerable quantity into the jugular vein of a sheep. At each stroke of the piston of the syringe, a gurg- ling sound was heard in the heart, there was slight diffi- culty in breathing, and strong convulsions. The experi- ment occupied ten minutes. When the animal was re- leased at the end of this time, he manifested a desire to eat, and mixed with the rest of the flock.* Similar experi- ments have been previously described by Nysten and others. Those cases which prove fatal after the lapse of some days, affi)rd a most interesting and important subject of inquiry. In some instances death is owing, as Nysten's experiments prove, to an affection of the lungs. This able experimenter states, that when the air is not in sufficiently large quantity to put a stop to the vital functions, by ar- resting the contractions of the right side of the heart, it is forced into the minute ramifications of the pulmonary artery, thus producing such obstruction as causes bronchitis, which may terminate in death ; and it appears that this event some- times happens so late as the third or fourth day. In a case belonging to this class, the following are the post mortem â€¢ Boston Med. and Surg. Journ,, as quoted in Lan9ette Fran(,aise, Mai 1835.

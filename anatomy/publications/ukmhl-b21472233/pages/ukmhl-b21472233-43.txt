the first place, the various experiments which have been performed by several physiologists, and which appear to bear upon, and in any way elucidate the subject. I shall also endeavour to ascertain from what source has arisen that diversity of opinion which authors have been led to entertain. After- wards I shall state the ideas I have myself ga- thered whilst engaged in the study of the subject; and if possible, in the last place, draw some con- clusion on this most interesting point, thus answer- ing, to the best of my ability, and as far as the pre- sent advance of physiological research will allow, the question under notice. In pursuing the sub- ject, however, considerable difficulty will have to be encountered, not merely from the intricacy of the subject itself, but likewise from the very loose and imperfect manner in which I find this branch of science has been treated of by those learned in- dividuals who have elucidated, by their enquiries, so many physiological difficulties, and to whose names, as authorities, we are accustomed to look with deference and respect. They will be found in many instances referring to this subject with comparative neglect, or founding their opinions on what those studying it must be compelled, in this age of close research, to pronounce as insufficient data. The influence, real or supposed, exerted by the par vagum on the secretion of the juices of the stomach, during digestion, has long been referred

50 some peculiar nervous influence, engendered in the minute ramifications of the nerves embracing the capillaries ;* and Gaspard employs the term " gazeificalion vilale^ in his essay on the subject.-f- The experiments of Magendie and Girardin clearly shew that the gas secreted by the intestines is not the result of any chemical decomposition, but is truly a vital secretion. After many careful observations, they found that the nature of the aliment did not influence the nature of the gas which was produced, but that this was in- variably the same. In the smaller intestines the gases de- tected were carbonic acid, hydrogen, and nitrogen ; and in the lower boM'els they found the same gases, with the addi- tion of sulphuretted hydrogen.J From all these considera- tions, then, it seems manifest, that although in many cases, accumulations of gas within the body owe their origin to chemical decomposition, yet nevertheless they are some- times the products of a vital action. Whatever be the explanation of the fact, it is quite cer- tain that emphysema frequently takes place without any lesion, and that in such cases upon dissection air is found in the blood vessels. There are some curious instances, however, on record, in which there seems at least a very strong probability that during life a very large quantity of air was contained in the blood-vessels. A man twenty-five years of age, who had been ill for fifteen days, was admitted into the Hopital Cochin of Paris, " with symptoms of typhus fever ; he also complained of pain in the left thigh ; and whilst he was in a state of delirium, said he had been bitten on the knee " Lobstein, op. cit.

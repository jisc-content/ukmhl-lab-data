HOW FAR ARE SECRETION AND NUTRITION DEPENDE>JT ON NERVOUS INFLUENCE? In the bodies of all animals in which a circu- lation is known to be performed, there is found ex- isting a species of apparatus, either forming dis- tinct organs and occupying determinate stations, or more diffusely spread throughout the system, whereby certain fluids are separated from the blood, differing as widely from each other in their appearance, character, and purposes, as from the vital stream whence they are derived. The or- gans which perform these all-important functions vary greatly in their anatomical constitution, pre- senting at one part the appearance of a compact and solid gland, whilst at another that only of a simply extended membrane. Yet though differ- ing so much, as they certainly do, in their gene- ral appearance, anatomists inform us that their necessary constituents are not very dissimilar. It A

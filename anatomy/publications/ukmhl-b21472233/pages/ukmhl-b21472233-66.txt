26 we may infer, I think, with considerable propriety, that future well-directed research will establish the existence of nerves in those which remain. Then, in regard to vegetables, independently of the fact of their belonging to a different natural kingdom, in which all the vital processes are per- formed with gi-eater simplicity, and in which many belonging to animals are altogether deficient, we may state that the analogy is not strictly perfect, and, therefore, although admissible as a corrobo- rative, can scarcely be used as a decisive argument. I have much pleasure in being able to add the authority of Roget in support of the above argu- ment, who, after observing that the organic affi- nities which produce secretion, and all those un- known causes which effect the nutrition, deve- lopement, and growth of each part, are placed under the control of the nervous powei*, goes on to remark, that " as the functions of plants are sufficiently simple to admit of being conducted without the aid of muscular power, still less do they require the assistance of nervous energy." * I make no use of the statement which has, I am aware, been ventured by some vegetable physio- logists, that nerves do actually exist in this king- dom, as by M. Dutrochet and M. Brachet, the latter of whom declares his opinion that they belong to the ganglionic system, for the fact of * Bridgewater Treatise, Vol. ii. p. 357. 4

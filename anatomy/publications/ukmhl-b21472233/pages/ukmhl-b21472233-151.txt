Thermomctric. Tables ; Barometric Tables ; Tables of Tuises, French Feet and Inches, Metres and Millimetres ; Tables of English Feet and Inches. Ccilculatcd by George Atkin, Esq. Thermometuic Tables, Nos. I. II. III. The following Tables are for the purpose of converling the degrees of the three thermomctric scales into one another. When the quantity to be converted is a whole number, its value is as- certained by simple inspection of that table in which the pro- posed scale stands in the first column. Thus, to convert + 85 R. into degrees of Fahrenheit and Centigrade, by Table I. we find : + 85 R. = 223.25 F. and 106.25 C. Again, if —65 C. were the given number, we find in Table II. —65 C. = —85.0 F. and —52.0 R. Lastly, to convert + 42 F. into the corresponding scales, in Table III. we find : + 42 F. = + 4.44 K. and + 5.55 C. If there be fractional parts annexed to the proposed number, by having recourse to the table of proportional parts, the value of the part is ascertained, and must be added to the number found in the body of the table; observing that, when the signs are alike, the sum is taken when unlike the difference. The signs of the fractional parts are the same in all the scales. Example. 1. Convert + 44.2 R. into degrees of Fahr. and Cent.: By Table I. + 44 R. = + 131.00 F. + 55.00 C. + 0.2 = 0.45 0.25 44.2 R. = 131.45 F. 55.25 C. 2. Convert —40.4 R. into degrees of Fahr. and Cent.: —40 R. = —58.00 F. —50.00 C. — 0.4 = _ 0.9 — 0.5 —40.4 R. = _6«.9 F. —50.5 C.

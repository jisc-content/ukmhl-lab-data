34 the essay render it almost unnecessary to perform this part of my duty. The evident inclination which I have to adopt the theory of the depend- ence of the secretion on the nervous influence must have been easily detected. But I feel myself com- pelled to admit that the subject still I'equires a con- siderable share of close investigation, and it has always been allowed to be one of the most myste- rious and difficult of elucidation in the whole range of physiological science. The arguments, too, on the opposite side, must, in common candour, be al- lowed to be most powerful. Yet, nevertheless, I regard the theory which I am thus inclined to adopt as one progressively gaining strength, which it will continue, with the general advance of phy- siology, to do until established on a firmer basis than that on which it at present exists. In sup- port of this idea we have the recent discoveries of nervous systems in the lower classes of animals, which it must be remembered takes away at every step a strong hold of the opposing theory. We have likewise the recent, and, if correct, very important experiments of Brachet, which, I ima- gine, only require confirmatoxy repetition almost to decide the conti'oversy. The observations of this physiologist, from some cause or other, which I am at a loss to explain, are viewed with general distrust in this country. This may arise from the results of almost all his experiments, too exactly supporting, what appear

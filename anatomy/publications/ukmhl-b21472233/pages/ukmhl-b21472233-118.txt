26 consideration, is the situation of the orifice through which the air enters. Magendie made the curious discovery, that when air is injected into one of the branches of the Ve7ia portce, no in- convenience seems to result from the operation. This must obviously depend upon some change which the air under- goes in its passage through the portal circulation. It is either absorbed, or so intimately mixed with the blood, as to be rendered incapable of causing any impediment to the circulation. Experiment. I threw a quantity of air into one of the mesenteric veins of a rabbit, and in eight minutes after- wards killed the animal. The liver was in a state of al- most complete anaemia, and upon slicing it, minute bubbles of air appeared at every point on the incised surfaces. There was no air apparent in the heart, nor in any part of the body, except the liver.* Having thus very briefly considered the principal cir- cumstances which modify the effects resulting from the ad- mission of air into the circulation, it still remains for us to attend to the precise nature of the modifications presented under these varying circumstances. We have seen that quantity modifies the result to a very great extent; but to what extent I am unable to state, as I have killed one animal with much less than was required to destroy another, apparently similar in strength and size. As a vast number of experiments would have been neces- sary, before any thing like a satisfactory average result • Assistants in this experiment—Mr. Thomas R. Scott, and Mr. William Scott.

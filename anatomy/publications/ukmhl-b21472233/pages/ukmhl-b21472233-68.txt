Bichat divide those numerous branches of nerves w^hich closely accompany the spermatic ar- â–º tery, and which, if he did. not, might suffice for the performance of the analogous function of which he speaks ? * Mr Mayo, too, formerly pub- lished an experiment, in which he is stated to have divided the nerves of the kidney, a:fter which the natural secretion proceeded, f This statement is, I imagine, sufficiently answered by the very nu- merous and satisfactory experiments already de- tailed, :j: which, from the apparent accuracy with which they were performed, must be deemed more worthy of attention than the single one in question, in the performance of which some fallacy must have existed. The probability is, that Mr Mayo, seeing some fluid collected in the bladder, deemed this a sufficient proof that the secretion had been duly performed ; whereas, had he carefully ex- amined the nature of the contents, he would have found them resembling in character that described in the thesis of M. Naveau. Again, the state of patients when labouring under paralysis has been adduced as a further argument, for it is said that, under these circumstances, secre- tion is continually performed, and that inflamraa- " Anatomie Generale, Vol. iv. p. 604. f Outlines of PhysiologJ^ X Of Naveau, Brachet, &c. p. 19. et seq.

19 sure at least, part of the difficulties by which we are so completely surrounded. Naveau, in his inaugural dissertation, gives the following as the result of some of his experiments : Having previously ascertained that rhubarb ad- ministered to dogs might be easily detected in the urine, he divided the nerves going to the kidneys, and emptied the bladder. He gave the animal rhubarb, and in the space of eight hours the blad- der was found filled with a purple-coloured urine, which was otherwise much changed in character. Urea was considerably less in quantity, and albu- men much increased. Lint dipped in the fluid was tinged red by the colouring matter of the blood which was contained in it, but not the slightest trace of rhubarb could be detected. After this the secretion continued gradually to lose its characte- ristic properties, until at length it contained no- thing but colouring matter of the blood suspend- ed in a clear and thin watery fluid. This experi- ment was repeated by him several times with pre- cisely similar results. He also states that divi- sion of the par vagum slightly affects this secre- tion, for although when rhubarb is administered it cannot be detected in the contents of the blad- der, yet the natural constituents of the fluid re- main the same. When the spinal marrow was divided at the first dorsal vertebra, the secretion continued, and rhubarb given was speedily detect- ed in it, but the characters of the fluid were slight-

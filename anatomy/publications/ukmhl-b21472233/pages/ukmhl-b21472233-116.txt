24 almost no symptoms of uneasiness. Upon examining the chest immediately after death, the lungs were in both in- stances found collapsed, and devoid of emphysema. The heart particularly in one instance was greatly distended with air, and had an elastic feel. In both instances, when the scalpel was thrust into each of the cavities of the heart, a little air unmingled with blood rushed out with a whizzing noise. Not the slightest trace of frothing could be de- tectedâ€”a circumstance which by the way, it may be remark- ed, tends to corroborate the notion formerly suggested, that the frothing of the blood is caused by the irregular motions of the heart which sometimes immediately precede or fol- low death.* In the experiments described in the first chapter, almost the whole calibre of the vein was occupied with the tube, and death ensued in a very few minutes, whereas in the cases of the two dogs just detailed, a good deal of blood was allowed to flow down the vessel along with the air, and hence it was, I apprehend, that the baneful effects were so little apparent. 2d, It may be stated as a general conclusion, that the greater the rapidity with which the air is introduced, and the greater the diavietcr of the tube through which it passes, so much the more sudden and deleterious is the result. This appears obvious from various statements already made, and it is therefore unnecessary in this place to supply additional illustrations. In those cases of operation in which a fatal termination almost immediately ensued, it seems evident, that owing to * My assistants in performing this experiment were Drs. J. Y. Simp- gon, and J. H. Pollexfen, and Mr. William Scott.

2 is not for me to enter on the discussion as to what constitutes a secreting organ, and whether in it it is absolutely necessary that an excretory duct should form a part. We.know that similar pro- cesses go on in some membranes whose minute glands cannot strictly be said to have proper ex- cretory ducts, and also pver. the whole surface of the body, as well as in those which possess these tubes. We know likewise that in all these pro- cesses blood-vessels, conveying an abundant sup- ply of their proper contents, are essentially requir- ed ; and it is also ascertained, with a considei'able degree of certainty, that in all these cases nerves are distributed to these organs, excepting, perhaps, in some of the very lowest in the scale of animals, where the fact of the existence of a nervous sys- tem has not been fully proved, though, I think, with a tolerable degree of reason, inferred. As to the part performed by the blood, physiologists are at once agreed, from it are separated those fluids which it is the function of each oi'gan to afford; but how these changes are brought about, and what share the nerves have in the perfection of the process, constitutes one of the most mysterious and difficult questions to which the enquirer can direct his attention. Notwithstanding its alarm- ing perplexity, it is the one I propose to make the subject of enquiry in the following essay, and without further preface I enter upon the task. I purpose, in considering this subject, to notice, in

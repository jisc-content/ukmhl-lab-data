43 If the state of the parts render it necessary immediately to apply pressure to the wounded vein, and should it be impossible or inexpedient to attempt relief, by opening any of the great vessels near the heart, the next best thing which can be done, is to relieve the circulation by some less direct method, which may be readily accomplished either by venesection at the bend of the elbow, or by opening the temporal artery. Dr. Warren, of Harvard University, has published a case in which there is every reason to believe that the patient was saved by the latter operation. When this gentleman was removing a cancerous tumour from the left side of the face and neck, in a case in which all the neighbouring tissues were involved in the disease, a very distinct sound was heard resembling the passage of air through water. The patient became faint, his countenance livid, respiration stertorous, and convulsions were observed. The wounded vessel (which was a small vein running across the neck) through which the air had rushed, was immediately compressed, and the temporal artery opened, when the blood issued forth in abundance. During the first twenty minutes there was a very marked abatement of the alarming symptoms. He continued, however, in a state of insensibility, for two hours and ten minutes longer, when he awoke, as if from sleep, and on the following morning was in his usual state, with the exception of some soreness over the thorax, and a headache. The operation was afterwards completed; and when the wound had nearly healed, the patient was dismissed at his own request.* The time during which he was in the hospital after the accident, â€¢ Medical Gazette, vol. xii. p. 2G9, wliere Dr. Wuireii's paper from the American Journal of Medical Science is given.

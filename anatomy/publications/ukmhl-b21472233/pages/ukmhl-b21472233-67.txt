27 such existence cannot, in the present state of our knowledge, be positively asserted. Another argu- ment made use of on this side of the question, is the occasional production of foetuses, in which a portion or portions of the nervous system have been found deficient, and in which the different parts of the body had attained a full size, inferring justly from this fact, that the various secretions have been duly performed. The instance of this species of malformation most frequently quoted, is that published some years ago by Mr Lawrence.* In this case, the child lived a few days after birth, and amongst others, the secretion of urine was duly performed. Besides this, numerous others have been from time to time recorded, of a similar nature, but in these as in that detailed by Mr Law- rence, more or less distinct traces of a nervous sys- tem have generally existed. Positive experiments are likewise confidently ap- pealed to in support of this doctrine, as, for instance, that of Bichat on one of the testicles of a dog, the nerves going to which he is said to have divided. Inflammation terminating in suppuration succeed- ed to the operation, which of course, as he observes, obscured the result of the experiment; but he in- sinuates that the very fact of the formation of matter taking place, would lead him to conclude that the nerves are not necessary to the seminal secretion, as this, the formation of matter, is an â€¢ Medico-Chimrgical Transations, Vol. v.

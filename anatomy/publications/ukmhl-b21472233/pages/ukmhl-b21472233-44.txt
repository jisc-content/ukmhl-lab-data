Many and various' are the means which have been adopted for destroying or suspending their action, but the conclusions derived, are, I fear, liable to considerable objection. But without anticij)ating, I shall endeavour to give a brief out- line of what has hitherto been done by physiolo- gists on this part of the subjecit'. 'lit is not my in- tention to introduce all the i)ublished experiments relating to this point, as that would be totally in- consistent with the limits of an essay of this kind, but merely a few of tlie most important, from which an idea may be formed of their value as an argument in considering the question under pre- sent notice. Experimenis sneWing' the effects of section of the par vagum'are of vei"^ ancient origin; per- haps, however, those performed with a view of ascertaining the changes produced by this opera- tioii oil the respiratory functions have the highest claim to antiquity. With this part of the enquiry, however, I have not to intei'fere, but to those au- thors who have mentioned the effects on digestion, I may, I imagine, with propriety here refer.

19 vessels, in sufficient quantity to prove fatal to a female ex- hausted with the fatigues of labour. Le Gallois mentions three female animals, upon which he was making experiments with a view of observing the ef- fects of abstinence and loss of blood, in which sudden death took place from air entering the circulation by the uterine veins.* Baudelocque-f states, that in examining the bodies of patients who had died of uterine haemorrhagy in the hospi- tal of La Maternite, he constantly found a gaseous sub- stance in the arteries. This he assigns (apparently without any reason) as the cause of the convulsions which precede death. He states that he has no doubt but that the gas is spontaneously generated. This opinion may or may not be correct, for it is at least possible that the air may be ad- mitted from without, since the bleeding depends upon the imperfect closing of these sinuses ; and as in cases of uterine haemorrhagy after labour, convulsive contraction and dilata- tion of the uterus is not uncommon, the possibility of death being occasioned by the air drawn in by this sucking power is at least entitled to consideration. It must be admitted, however, that with the scanty light which the records of pathology are yet able to throw upon this point, it would be rash to give any decided opinion upon the subject. In a case recorded by Leclerc (and which occurred in the practice of Dubois and Boyer), we can hardly conceive that the air was drawn in by the process above suggested.

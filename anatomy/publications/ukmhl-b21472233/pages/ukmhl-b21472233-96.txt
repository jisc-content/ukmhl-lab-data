4 occurrence considered inexplicable, may, probably, with correctness, be referred to this cause ; and some instances of sudden death after parturition are now occasionally explain- ed on the supposition of air entering by the uterine sinuses. The not unfrequent occurrence of these untoward events renders our subject one of peculiar interest, independent of that which must ever be excited by the examination of so curious a point in physiology ; for the important inquiry is naturally suggested, can nothing be done in such emer- gencies ? But this question cannot be satisfactorily an- swered at present ; for till we have seen the order in which the vital processes are arrested, we cannot hope to be able to discover a method of averting this catastrophe. The baneful eflPects of the injection of air into the blood vessels were known to Wepfer and others among the older pathologists,* but it was Dupuy tren who first pointed it out as the cause of some of those sudden deaths which take place during surgical operations, and since his observa- tions on this subject have been published, a number of such cases have been described by surgeons in Great Britain, on the Continent, and in America. Wepfer killed an ox by blowing into the jugular vein, and is believed to be the first who made such an experiment. As far as I am aware, the physiological effects caused by the introduction of air into the veins, were first made the subject of experiment in this country by Brown Langrish, and described by him to the Royal Society of London about the year 1746. This enthusiastic experimental physiolc- â€¢ The following, among the older authors, have noticed this sub- ject, viz.

56 it does not seem too hypothetical to suggest that in the cases which occurred in the ". Hopltal Cochin" and the Hospital at Rouen, the immediate cause of death was the presence of a large quantity of gaseous matter in the heart. We have seen that violent mental emotions sometimes oc- casion the disengagement of large quantities of air. Is it possible that the rapid evolution of this elastic fluid is ever the immediate cause of those instantaneous deaths which fre- quently follow sudden and immoderate emotions of joy or grief.'' Death it would appear sometimes takes place from the sudden disengagement of gas within the vessels of the brain, constituting the gaseous apoplexy of Morgagni and other authors ; but a mere reference to this subject must suffice, as the appropriate limits of a Thesis have I fear been already exceeded. The idea of Morgagni was, that the cause of death was the pressure exerted upon the brain by the air; but Bichat thought that in some cases the quantity of air found is so small as not to give plausibility to this explana- tion, and contended that the life of the brain was destroyed by some peculiar and subtle action exerted upon it.* All that can be said with confidence, then, in reference to this subject, is, that there are various facts and arguments which render it exceedingly probable, that owing to the sudden formation of air within the blood-vessels, death may be produced either by arresting the contractions of the right side of the heart, or by producing a fatal action on the brain. โข Surla Vie et la Mort, Part ii.

If the question under consideration is capable of being elucidated by any series of experiments, it must be by one, perform- ed on some of the numerous secreting organs of the body, whose functions ai'e less complicated, than those of the viscus which has hitherto occu- pied our attention. It has been found by numez-ous trials, that the kidneys may be exposed by cutting into the abdo- men, and yet the animal survive several hours, and, notwithstanding the severity of the opera- tion, it is ascertained, that the shock thus caused to the system is not sufficient to suspend the se- cretion of urine. That this is the case may easily be proved by emptying the bladder at the time of the operation, and afterwards, when death has taken place, or a sufficient time has been allowed to elapse, examining the state of the organ. The kidneys are supplied with nerves from the renal plexus, which is composed principally of branches of the sympathetic system, having, however, communication with the cerebro-spinal nervis. I shall now briefly notice some of the experi- ments which I have collected from various authors, illustrating the effects of injury of the different parts of the nervous system on the urinary secre- tion, believing, as I do, that these are, in the pre- sent state of our knowledge, better calculated than any others we possess, to clear up, in some mea-

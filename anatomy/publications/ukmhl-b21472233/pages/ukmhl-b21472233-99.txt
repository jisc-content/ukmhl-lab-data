7 the views of Bichat; and indeed these statements furnish but a poor foundation for the sweeping theory which he has attempted to rear upon them. Perhaps his strongest fact is, that death is preceded by convulsions ;â€”phenomena which must unquestionably arise in consequence of an impression made upon the central organs of the nervous system. But then, it may be fairly asked, are not these convulsions secondary results ? They occur in almost every case of violent death, and in numerous instances can be clearly traced to a pri- mary affection of the heart or lungs. Leroy alleges that convulsive movements are rarely to be witnessed. It may occasionally happen that they are not seen, but I am per- fectly satisfied that, in at least the great majority of cases, they do take place. In most of the cases in the human subject, which occurred during operations, there is express mention made of them, (as well as in experiments made upon animals) ; and when the circumstance is not noticed we have no right to conclude that it did not take place. I have been assured by my friend Mr. Dick of the veterinary school of this place, that although he has killed many horses by blowing air into the veins, he does not recollect of a single instance in which death was not preceded by violent convulsions. But be this as it may, the presence of the phenomenon in question cannot be held as proving that the brain is the organ primarily affected ; for it is obvious, that in whatever manner the supply of blood to the brain is suddenly diminished convulsions follow. The notion of some, that a sudden emphysema of the lungs is the cause of death, at first sight appears plaus- ible, and is certainly very ingenious; but upon cxamina-

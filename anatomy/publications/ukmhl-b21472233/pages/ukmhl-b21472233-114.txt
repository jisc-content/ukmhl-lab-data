22 CHAPTER II. CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MODIFY THE EFFECTS. OBSERVA- TIONS ON CASES IN WHICH DEATH DID NOT TAKE PLACE, OR WAS A SECONDARY RESULT. It has already been stated, that very considerable quantities of air may be introduced into the circulation without pro- ducing death. The concurrent testimony of a variety of experimenters establishes this beyond the possibility of doubt. Sometimes the patient to whom the accident happens, or the animal experimented upon, suffers only transient incon- venience, or makes a complete recovery, and in other in- stances death ensues so late as some days after the admis- sion of the air. Two very interesting subjects of investiga- tion are thus presented to our notice. In the first place, what are those circumstances which thus modify the result ? And then, what is the nature of the modifications which occur under these varying circumstances .'' First, then, let us attend to the different modifying causes. These appear chiefly to be referable to three heads : 1st, the quantity of air adviitted;—2nd, the rapidity of its admission ;—and, 3rd, the situation of the orifice through which it enters. For the sake of perspicuity, each of these points will be separately illustrated.

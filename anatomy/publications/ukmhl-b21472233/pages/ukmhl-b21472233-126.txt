34 to be distended with air.* " In an attempt which I made," says Di'. Mott, " to remove the parotid gland in an en- larged and schirrous state, the. facial vein where it passes over the base of the lower jaw was opened, in dissecting the integuments from the tumour in the early stage of the operation, before a single artery was tied. At the instant this vessel was opened, the attention of all present was ar- rested by the gurgling sound of air passing into some small opening. The breathing of the patient immediately became difficult and laborious. The heart beat violently and irregu- larly, his features were distorted, convulsions of the whole body soon followed to so great an extent, as to make it im- possible to keep him on the table. He lay upon the floor in this condition for near half an hour, as all supposed in arliculo mortis. " As the convulsions gradually left him, his mouth was permanently distorted, and complete hemiplegia was found to have ensued ; an hour or more elapsed before he could articulate, and it was nearly a whole day before he recovered the use of his arm and leg."-|* In most cases on record, we may infer, from the descrip- tions given, that there was a diseased state of the coats of the • Lanyette Fran9aise, 30th Nov. 1830. Clemot there details the particulars of two other accidents of a similar nature, which occurred in his own practice. In one case he was dissecting out a tumour from the axilla, and in the other tying the subclavian artery. Goullard of Lyons, when removing indurated glands from the axilla, wounded the axillary vein. Only a small quantity of blood was lost; but in an instant the patient became pale, the muscles of the face were convulsed, hiccup came on, which in a few minutes was followed by death. There was no post mortem examination. Duplat Gaz. Mi^d., Dec 1833. ■\ Med. Chirurg. Journ. Lond. vol. xvi. p. 33.

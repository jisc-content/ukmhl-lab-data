29 Upon dissection, immediately after killing it, the lungs were found to be perfectly healthy, and there was no air in any of the blood vessels.* It is the opinion of some, that death may take place after the lapse of some days from the time the air has entered the vessels, and yet be attended with all the striking phe- nomena usually presented when the fatal event is an imme- diate consequence. I am not aware of any facts which at all justify such a supposition, but since the notion is enter- tained by some, it is proper to mention it in this place. The following case is interesting, though unfortunately it does not throw any very positive light upon this part of the subject, since, by assuming either view as correct, the phenomena may be satisfactorily explained. It is as much, therefore, with a view of shewing that although the most formidable symptoms have been manifested, and immediate death seems almost inevitable, the patient may notwith- standing speedily rally; thus pressing upon our attention the important fact, that if the heart be in any way suffi- ciently disencumbered of the air, it may regain its natural action, and "the circulation, after having been all at once violently disordered, and almost arrested, may in a few mi- nutes go on as before the accident. This points out the important practical bearing of our inquiries, and holds out a good ground of hope that some useful rules may be sug- gested, by an attentive consideration of this branch of the subject. But to proceed.â€”M.

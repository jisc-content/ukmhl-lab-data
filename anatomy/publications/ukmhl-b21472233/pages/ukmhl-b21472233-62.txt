^2 but still found that a flvxid was separated from the blood, of a rose colour, and having a distinctly urinous smell. Again having proceeded as in the last case, he in addition introduced a tube into the renal artery, and then divided the vessel com- pletely upon it, by which means the circulation was perfectly maintained, whilst the continuity of nervous communication was as perfectly destroy- ed. The animal in this case lived four hours, dur- ing which time three ounces of a red liquid had passed into the bladder, which in all respects re- sembled blood. No wound in the kidney could be detected to account for this. He proved by another set of experiments, that this mode of ope- rating did not suspend the circulation through the organ, for on making incisions into it, in various parts, perfect jets of arterial blood were yielded from the divided surfaces.* I have thus endeavoured to collect the results of theprincipal experiments, which have hitherto been used as arguments on the subject under consider- ation. I have already stated my belief that those first detailed, and which have hitherto been prin- cipally dwelt on by physiologists, are too compli- cated in their results, to allow a positive conclu- sion to be derived from them. Although the others which are afterwards mentioned, are perhaps bet- ter calculated for this end, yet I would not have * Recheiches experimentales sur les fonctions du systeme ner- veux ganglionaire, par M.

9 a natural condition.* I have suddenly distended the right auricle in the manner described by Magendie and Piedna- gel, but emphysema of the lungs was hardly ever observed, though the experiment was often repeated. In one or two cases the structure of the lungs certainly seemed somewhat broken up, but this might be, and in all proba- bility was, produced by the convulsive attempts at respira- tion which preceded death, just as happens in many cases of poisoning with strychnia and other substances. No one, so far as I am aware, has attempted to shew that the amount of emphysema found in animals killed with air, is sufficient of itself to produce a sudden and vio- lent death. Till this is done, the theory of Leroy, and others on this subject, must be considered visionary, since all the facts with which we are acquainted, are obviously op- posed to it. It is impossible to distinguish between old and recent emphysema, so that in some of the instances in which it has been found, there is reason to suppose that it may have been of some considerable standing. We know that people with very extensive emphysema of the lungs, may attain an advanced old age without necessarily suffering any great inconvenience, but what bears still more upon this point is, that extensive and sudden emphysema is often occasioned by a fit of whoop- ing cough, and yet we see no symptoms produced analogous to those caused by the entrance of air into the veins. From all these considerations, then, the hypothesis of Leroy, Ma- gendie, and others on this subject, appear wholly unsup- ported by facts, and must consequently be abandoned. " Boston Med. and Surg.

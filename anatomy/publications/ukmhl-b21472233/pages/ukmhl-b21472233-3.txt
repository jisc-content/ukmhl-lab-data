As the two following Papers, and more especially the second, have been so frequently referred to in my Anato- mical and Physiological Memoirs, I have thought it might be convenient for the reader to have them printed as an Appendix to No. 1st. They originally appeared in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal; the memoir on- the Taenia in 1821, and that on the Differential Pulse and its diurnal revolution in 1815. ROBERT KNOX.

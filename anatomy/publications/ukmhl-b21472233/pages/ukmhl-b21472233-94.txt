2 is suited to scientific details. This observation has been naturally suggested by the consideration of the subject of the following Essay. Bichat exceedingly exaggerated the deleterious effects produced upon the animal economy by the introduction of air into the veins, asserting that a bubble of air introduced into a vein occasioned immediate death. This statement the subsequent experiments of Nysten, Magendie, Dr. Blundell, and others, have proved to be utterly erroneous. Nysten found that a small quantity of all the various gases with which he experimented, including nitrous gas and sid- phureted hydrogen, might be introduced into the circula- tion without occasioning death,* and as will appear from experiments afterwards to be detailed, I have injected large quantities of air into the veins of dogs and rabbits, without the manifestation of any decided effect. For the sake of perspicuity, it seems necessary to arrange the great variety of topics to which our attention is de- manded, under some leading heads, and with this view the following Essay is divided into four chapters, each being to a certain extent a separate Essay. â€¢ Rech. de Physiol, et Chimie Pathol, p. 152.

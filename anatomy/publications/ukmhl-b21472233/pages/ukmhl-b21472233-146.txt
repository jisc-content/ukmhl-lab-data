54 by Nysten upon the authority of his friend Dr. De Jaer. The subject of the observation was a shoemaker of forty-five years of age, who had for the last fifteen years of his life been afflicted with spasmodic asthma, and had generally about seven violent accessions during the year, which came on without any premonitory symptoms. At the com- mencement of one of the exacerbations, he was brought to the " Hopital Cochin'" of Paris, where he died on the third day. The body was opened twelve hours after death, when it was yet warm. The left ventricle and the arteries contained no blood, but the right auricle and ventricle, and the whole venous system were distended with frothy blood. All the organs were in their natural state, and the muscles were very firm and red. What gives additional importance to this case is, the short time which was allowed to elapse between death and the examination of the body. The other case to which allusion has been made occurred to M. Laumonicr, in the hospital of Rouen.â€”A woman, aged fifty-six, died suddenly from an attack of asthma, a disease to which she was subject. The body was examined twenty-four hours after death. The season was winter; and there was not the slightest trace of putrefaction. There was emphysema in various parts of the body, and the in- ternal coat of the carotid artery had a red appearance, as if resulting from inflammation. The heart was very much distended, and its right cavities were filled with gaseous matter of a peculiar smell. for a catarrhal affection, the heart of which, upon dissection, was found enormously distended with air. (Veterinarian, vol. x. p. 65. Lond. Feb. 1837.) It is exceedingly to be regretted thut there is no mention made of the time which elapsed between death and dissection.

32 glandular apparatus, seated at the roots, and the manner in which this change was produced can only have been through the medium of the ner- vous system, and must therefore be regarded as a corroborative proof of the nervous theory. But by far the most cogent arguments, on this side of the question, are those derivable from the very important experiments already detailed, as per- formed by Naveau, Krimer, Brachet, and others. The first mentioned of these gentlemen, it will be remembered, found that substances introduced into the stomach, as rhubarb, which in the natu- ral state may be easily detected in the urine by well established tests, soon after its administz*ation, could no longer be so on division of the nerves going to the kidney ; moreover, that the secretion gradually ceased to manifest its usual properties, until at length nothing but the serous part of the blood, with a little of the colouring matter, was separated ; the result merely of a mechanical pro- cess of transudation. The result in these cases is the effect of an apparent and sufficient cause, and to me appears inexplicable on any other grounds than those to which it is here referred. The experiments of M. Brachet seem to confirm the above in every respect, and even go further in proof of the point in question; but these will require confirmation by other experimenters be- fore they can be implicitly trusted. If, however, the whole of this series be found to be correct,

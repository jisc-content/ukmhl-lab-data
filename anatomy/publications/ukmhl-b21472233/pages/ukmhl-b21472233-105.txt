13 into the jugular vein with great violence, and yet no em- physema be producecl. Experiment.—A tube was inserted in the jugular vein of a dog, and a large quantity of air introduced suddenly and with great force. The time occupied in this process was about six seconds, and at the end of this time, the vein was so distended with air, that no force employed caused any more to enter. I was just proceeding to tighten a ligature round the vessel, when the animal began to strug- gle, and after uttering some cries, expired in twelve seconds from the time the introduction of the air commenced. Secti'o.—The chest was immediately examined. The lungs presented their usual appearance. The heart was greatly distended, and from its engorged state was con- tracting very feebly. The right side of the heart was full of light frothy blood. The inferior cava contained little blood, but was much distended with air, as were to a great- er or less extent most of the venous trunks of any consider- able size. The coronary veins presented the same appear- ance as the inferior cava. In the veins of the hind legs there were only a few bubbles of air, but it was observed that all over the body there was great congestion of the venous system. There was no air in the left side of the heart. The obvious explanation of these phenomena is, that the air had been sent directly through the right auri- cle into the inferior vena cava and coronary veins; for its absence from the left side of the heart clearly indicates that what was found in the veins had not made the round of the circulation. From this experiment then it appears that very great force may be used without producing any em-

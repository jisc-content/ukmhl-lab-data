8 tion it will, I think, be found untenable. When a large quantity of air was thrown directly into the right auricle by Piednagel and Magendie, the former states that respiration all at once ceased, and the heart's pulsations became strong and rapid. On dissection, the lungs were emphysematous and the right side of the heart distended with air, the left cavities containing only a little frothy blood. Piednagel gives the following account of the manner in which he supposes these appearances to be produced. He conceives that the air contained in the air cells, by means of its pressure prevents that mixed with the blood in the minute ramifications of the pulmonary artery from passing onwards ; that this resistance which the heart meets with in attempting to propel the blood through the lungs, acts as a stimulus upon it, and by redoubling the force of its contractions, breaks up the tissue of the lungs. It is urged as an argument in favour of emphysema being the cause of death, that air when introduced gradually and in small quantities produces very slight effects. But it is obvious that it by no means follows, that when death does suddenly take place from the entrance of a large quantity of air, it is caused by emphysema of the lungs. In the first place, emphysema is far from being a constant appearance, as will appear from cases and experiments to be detailed; and when found it can be accounted for in a much more simple way than that proposed by Piednagel. Dr. Wing killed a rabbit in a few seconds by the for- cible injection of air into the external jugular vein, and upon opening the chest the lungs were found collapsed ; and besides it is stated, that in every respect they were in

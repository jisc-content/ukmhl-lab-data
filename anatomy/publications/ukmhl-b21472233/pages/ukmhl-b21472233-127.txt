35 vessels ; but at the same time, a peculiar and constrained position of the parts might, as has already been stated, keep a vein in such a state as to allow of a large quantity of air being sucked into it. Such is the explanation which must be given of the appearances observed in the case of a student who committed suicide in this city some months ago, by cutting his throat. There was almost no blood lost; and upon examination, the heart was found to contain air in all its cavities. I am informed there was no thick- ened condition of the veins of the neck observed. In the transfusion of blood, air may be, and doubtless often has been injected into a vein; but if the operation is performed with very ordinary dexterity, it is difficult to ima- gine how a quantity sufficient to produce any disastrous con- sequences could be thrown in. Dr. Blundel, who has care- fully examined this point, says, that " it seems probable that the entrance of a few drachms of air into the vessels would be attended with considerable distress, and even dan- ger ; but it must be recollected, that if the operation be carefully performed by a competent person with a proper instrument, there can be no risk lest air should enter the vessels in large quantities ; and the probability is, that a bubble or two of air would occasion little if any inconve- nience."* The interest and importance of a physiological investiga- tion are greatly enhanced, when we enter upon it with a hope of being able to deduce useful rules of practice from our observations, and it is the belief of the author that his subject is possessed of this attraction.

20 suddenly seized with hsemorrhagy from one of the uterine vessels, and died in the course of three hours. Upon exa- mination of the body, various morbid appearances were noticed; but what particularly demands attention is, that there was no blood in the heart, that the inferior vena cava contained air alone, and that the peritoneum was in some places emphysematous.* There is no mention made as to the interval which elapsed between death and the examination, nor is it stated at what season of the year the event took place; so that it does not appear with what degree of probability the presence of air in the blood-vessels may be explained by supposing that decomposition of the blood had taken place. It must also be remembered, that in death from haemorrhagy, it is not unusual to find air in the veins. Mery states, that if the blood of an animal be drained out from an opening in the inferior vena cava, the veins fill with air in proportion as they empty of blood, and that the air comes from the smaller into the larger veins."f* Nysten says that this is by no means a constant result, and that it depends upon the size of the opening made in the vessel.^ I have repeated Mery's experiment, but found no air at all in the circula- tion, though the aperture in the vein was large. Another question suggested by the above considerations is, whether air generated within the body during life is not sometimes the immediate cause of death ; but this topic is not here discussed, because it appears that it may be more naturallv attended to afterwards. * Archives Gen. de Med., xviii.; p. 281. t Mem. de I'Acad. des Sciences, an. 1707. p. 167.

18 Observations on the following Table the pulse was reckoned in the sitting posture, (this is always to be understood, unless the contrary be ex- pressed) before breakfast, and a short time after rising from bed; and, in the evening, after a light supper, and generally some spirituous liquor, taken, however, in small quantity, and much diluted. The power of alcohol in raising the pulse is well known. The period is the summer time. TABtE. About 9, A, M.

In the morning, the pulse was reckoned immediately almost on rising from bed, and always before food of any kind was taken. Every circumstance, therefore, conspired to reduce the pulse. On the other hand, the evening pulse was reckoned after the many exertions under- gone during a long day,—after exercise of mind and body,— after food and drink; the pulse is, notwithstanding, consider- ably less frequent than in the morning, when every thing favourable to a rapid state of the circulation was carefully guarded against. But the pulse is not only in general quicker in the morning than in the evening ; it is also more excitable ; i. e. the same quantity of food or drink, the same degree of exercise, sTiall be found to exalt the pulse more in the morning than at any other period of the day or night; and the capability of being excited may, generally speaking, be said to diminish from a very early hour until the same hour next morning. The data on which this assertion rests are pretty numerous, though Bot so complete as I could have wished them to be. To accomplish this, would have required a complete change of my mode of life, which I found at the time impracticable.

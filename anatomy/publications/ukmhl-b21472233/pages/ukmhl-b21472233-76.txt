36 ganglionic system this power has its means of ope- ration. When, however, the first of these ques- tions shall have been answered, then the second will open out a most inviting field for interesting enquiry. I have now only, in conclusion, briefly to no- tice the second part of my subject, and to explain the reasons why its consideration has not formed a more prominent feature in the pages of this es- say. Its omission has not been one of accident but rather of design; for regarding, as I do, the process by which the solid textures of the ani- mal machine, when worn out by the continued performance of their various functions, are con- stantly renewed, one, as essentially belonging to the order of secretion, as that of the urine or sali- va, I was inclined to believe that its inti'oduction might, in some measure, complicate the subject, and thus tend to obviate that degree of clearness which it has been my object to attain. I need scarcely adduce proofs of the similarity which I have just mentioned ; they are performed by the same system of vessels, and are, as far as is yet known, regulated by the same laws. In this view I am supported by numerous physiologists ; thus Haller regarded nutrition, and characterized it as " omnium simplissiraa secretio ;" and in this his authority has been deservedly respected. Few experiments have hitherto been made re- specting the direct influence of the nervous power

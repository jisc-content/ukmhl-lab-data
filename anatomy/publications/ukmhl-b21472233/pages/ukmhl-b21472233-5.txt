OBSEEVATIONS ON THE TiENIA SOLIUM; AND ON ITS REMOVAL FROM THE HUMAN INTESTINAL CANAL BY SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE. Since the publication of the learned and elaborate work of Rudolphi on intestinal and other worms,* the numerous disputed points relative to the origin, growth, and propagation of these, seem to have been tacitly given up by medical men in favour of the opinions of that learned and ingenious author; or the inquiry, perhaps, has, from its abstruseness, been deemed beyond the present bounds of science. To the admirers of natural history, it would be superfluous to offer any apology for these brief remarks on one species of intestinal worm ; and to the practical medical man, few inquiries can be more interesting, as its aim is to elucidate the origin and treatment of an exceed- ingly obscure and untractable complaint. It has happened to me to witness the disease of tape-worm on an extensive scale, and even, to a certain extent, to experiment on its nature. The observations I have made seem to throw some additional light on this very obscure subject. Should it appear differently to the readers of your widely circulated Journal, I shall still feel satisfied in having performed my duty to science, by submitting these cases and remarks to the public. The colony of the Cape of Good Hope is remarkable for the general salubrity of its climate. It enjoys, indeed, almost an immunity from the host of diseases to which, in other countries, mankind is exposed; to this there are a few exceptions, amongst â€¢ Entozoomm, sive Vermium Intcstinalium Historia Naturalis.

17 mi ties causes the function to be properly discharg- ed ? The third theory involves another much dis- puted point in physiology, viz. the dependence or independence of the muscular contractions on the nerves, and accordingly as the one or other of these opinions is held, will the answer given to this part of the enquiry be regulated. Wilson Philip, as has already been stated in this essay, affirms that the motions of the intestines are per- fectly independent of the nervous system, and for this opinion he has the authority of the illustrious Haller, and numerous other distinguished physi^-^, ologists. In addition to these, I may here short- ly advert to the opinion of Magendie, who conceives that this effect upon the stomach is produced se- condarily, by the derangement taking place in the,, respiratory organs ; for he states, that he found,,,, when the par vagum was divided below tht^.. branches sent to the lungs, a perfect digestion tooj^., place. Several experiments of very able physiolo- gists, some of which have been already quoted,^ contradict this result; neither has the opinion else- where received any material support. M. Brachet states in regard to it, that, from the numerous branches into which these nerves divide in the chest, M. Magendie must have failed in dividing them all. But it is time that I should leave this part of my subject; and I imagine that little more need be advanced, under this head, to prove the perfect complexity in which it is involved as cori- B

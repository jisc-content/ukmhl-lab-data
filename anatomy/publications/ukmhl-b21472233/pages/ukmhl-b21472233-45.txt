5 of effects of injury of the par vagurn. On con- sulting his work, I find that he refers to Willis, * who makes mention of the injurious effects of liga- ture of these nerves on the digestive functions. Shortly after him Valsalva f notices similar effects produced on these organs by like operations. Ba- glivi :|: states that, on dividing the eighth pair, he found that respiration became difficult, and that whatever was takenforsorae time after such an ope-f ration was vomited. On dissection after death, which usually took place about the twelfth day , the oeso- phagus was full of imdigested food, which had been more recently eaten, which circumstance he attributes to the inability of the animal to swallow perfectly. Brunn ยง mentions that, in his experi- ments when the par vagum on both sides was di- vided, the dog on which the operation was per- formed would eat nothing but a little grass, which was fovmd in the stomach, after death, unchang- ed, along with matters having the appearance of true faeces. Haller appears, as far as I have been^ able to ascertain, (to have paid little attention to, the influence of the nervous system on secretion. He gives, however, a few experiments on the par vagum, along with their results, which have some connection with the present part of our enquiry. * Willis de Nervorum usu, Tom. i. cap. 24. f Valsalva Opera omnia, curante Morgagni.

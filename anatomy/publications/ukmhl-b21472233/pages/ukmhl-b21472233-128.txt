from what has aheady been advanced, that the deleterious effects resulting from the entrance of air during operations is purely mechanical, and that the death of the patient de- pends simply upon the contractions of the right side of the heart being arrested, or greatly impeded, in consequence of the presence of that elastic fluid. Hence it is naturally suggested, that the means most likely to afford safety to the patient will consist in relieving the heart with the greatest possible expeditionâ€”an inference, it may be remarked, which points out the practical importance of studying the order in which the vital functions become arrested. We are also strengthened in the hope, of being frequently able in this way to save the patient, by a knowledge of the astonishing advantages which result from opening the jugu- lar vein in certain cases of poisoning, in which the deleterious agent produces a sudden but merely transient arrestment of the contractions of the heart, and where death seems to re- sult from this state being rendered permanent, in conse- quence of the distention which has taken place during the period of temporary inaction. We generally find that in such cases, by timeously relieving the congestion of the heart, its contractions are in the course of a few seconds re- newed, and speedily go on with nearly their usual regu- larity ; but if this be not done, the animal generally dies very quickly, the circulation being greatly impeded, or wholly arrested by the mechanical distention of the heart with blood. The intervention of the valve does not prevent a reflux current, as might be supposed, so that this impor- tant principle admits of easy application, both in cases of en- gorgement with blood, as well as in those in which air is the distending agent.

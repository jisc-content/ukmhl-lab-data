They cannot serve the purpose of assisting in the circulation, else we might infer that they would be found upon the veins : and Dr Allen Thomson tells us, in an able paper on the circulation, lately published, " that although the circulation in the small vessels is ob- viously liable to be modified by the state of the nerves in their neighbourhood, or perhaps by af- fections of the nervous system in general, there is no reason to consider the capillary circulation as more immediately dependent on the nervous influ- ence than is the action of the heart."* The known effects of opium, in suspending the secreting func- tions generally over the body, will serve likewise in support of this doctrine, more especially when the method in which it acts upon the system is remembered. It is through the nerves alone that this very powerful drug produces its effects ; and we find that, whilst the economy is labouring un- der its action, secretion generally is either arrest- ed, or at any rate materially diminished.

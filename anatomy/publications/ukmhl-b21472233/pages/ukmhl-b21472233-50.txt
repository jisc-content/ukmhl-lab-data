10 some gastric juice having been secreted before the power of the nervous influence has been destroy- ed, a certain time must elapse before the chyme thus formed can be propelled onwards, and the stomach subjected to that unaccustomed irritation which causes the action of vomiting.* Dr Clarke Abel, in prosecuting the enquiries of the last mentioned author, in regard to the effect of galvanism on secretion conveyed through the nervous system, found, on dividing the par vagum in the neck, that the process of digestion was sus- pended from the loss of the secretory power of the stomach, f Broughton, in a number of experiments, per- formed on different animals, ascertained that when food of various kinds was given both before and after the operation, that first taken was partially digested, whilst the latter had undergone no change. On some of them the operation produ- ced little or no distress for several hours, but that after this time they were greatly affected, and usually perished within the space of twenty-four hours. :|: JMageiidie, himself, formerly attributed the de- rfmgements of the digestion to tlie effects produced on the gastric secretion, by the interruption of the ' Wilson Philip's experimental enquiry into the laws of the vital functions. f Medical and Physical Journal, Vol. xllu.'

and at the same time given the last stroke of the knife which concluded the separation of the tumour, when the patient exclaimed, / arn (Jj/ing, was seized with a general trembling, and quickly expired. All the usual methods resorted to for the recovery i'rom syncope and asphyxia were tried without any success, though persevered in for several hours. Sectio.â€”The body was examined twenty-four hours after death, and the right auricle was found distended with air so as to give it an elastic tension, and when an incision was made through its parietes, the air escaped in great quantity with- out any admixture of blood ; it nevertheless contained a small quantity of uncoagulated blood. The other cavities of the heart (which were healthy,) the arteries and veins throughout the body, and the membranes of the brain, con- tained fluid blood mixed with air. The lungs were red, pliable, crepitant, elastic, and perfectly healthy. There was no wound in the trachea. The serous membranes of the brain were thin and transparent, without serosity and with- out injection. Its tissue was firm, uninjected, and with the colours well marked. Red spots were observed on the stomach, some of them evidently owing to injection of the capillaries. The muscles were firm and red. In neither of these cases are there any facts of importance to support the hypothesis of Bichat. The presence of air in the vessels of the brain sinks into insignificance, when wc dis- cover that it is also found in every minute artery and vein all over the body. The existence of emphysema of the lungs in Beauchere's case, may fairly be considered as purely acci- dental. In the operation cases detailed, as well as others of a similar nature on record, it was in all probability produced by

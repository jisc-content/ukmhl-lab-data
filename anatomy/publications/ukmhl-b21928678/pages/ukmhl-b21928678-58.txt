58 we doubt not, would be thrown into utter consternation and dismay at the thought of the vile stuff which nature thrusts down their throats. Some, we fear, must inevitably be placed in this predica- ment in respect to anatomy; they are too much influenced by prejudiced feelings to be ever satisfied with any enactments on this subject, and too fastidious ever to yield themselves to simple and homely reason. Such must necessarily be com- pelled to swallow what they will not take voluntarily. For our part, we are thoroughly convinced, that no sanitary law is more urgently called for, none would prove more practi- cally useful, more prolific in beneficial consequences to so- ciety, than one which should render imperative the post mor- tem examination of all bodies whether belonging to the rich or the poor. If the life of its subjects be precious to a kingdom, then such a law would be an act of great state policy; and if each individual is naturally desirous of possessing health, without which, existence becomes a worthless boon, he ought surely to be anxious for so salutary an enactment. Nor would any thing, probably, be more effectually conducive to the general dissipation of the erroneous impressions pre- valent respecting anatomical pursuits, than the countenance and approval of the latter by the laws of the land. At pre- sent, the law publicly brands them with infamy and dis- grace ; so that, what the practitioner ought to obtain as a matter of pure right and justice, considering the require- ments exacted of him by the public, he can now expect as a mere favour, if peradventure the very solicitation to inves- tigate a diseased structure be not construed into a love of cutting and slashing, as people sagaciously term the exami- nation. However distinguished for integrity and talent the medical man may be, however single his eye for the benefit of mankind, however pure and disinterested his views, how- ever assiduous and anxious his previous attentions to a pa- tient may have been, a request of the above nature cancels, for the time, all his virtues, nullifies the merit of his labours, and exposes him to suspicion, coolness, and insult.

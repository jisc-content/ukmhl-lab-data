8 science have been treated. It is, indeed, curious to trace the perpetual fluctuation of opinion on some points, and its long stagnation on others. The question both as to the necessity, and supposed turpitude of dissection, is one which of old gave rise to discussions still warmer and more prolix than those of modern times. The disputants, however, were formerly confined to such as devoted themselves to the study of physic; and this controversy engaged their attention both prior and subsequently to the time of Celsus, who has concisely and elegantly narrated the arguments adduced by each party.* In the present day, addicted to mere empiricism, or grossly ignorant must that medical man be who should pre- tend to question the necessity of paying the utmost atten- tion to anatomical pursuits. The progress of knowledge has so effectually enlightened practitioners on this head as to render their conclusion unanimous. Hence the disputes in which they were once embroiled respecting this subject have long ceased ; and could the public be brought to view the matter with calm and dispassionate attention, we might possibly anticipate a similar termination to the contention which at present exists betwixt it and the profession. Every enlightened physician and surgeon is fully aware that all his medical knowledge ultimately rests on anatomy: this constitutes the foundation on which the superstructure of his acquirements are raised. And we imagine it can require no very prolix argumentation to evince even to the unini- tiated the great importance of this fundamental branch of medicine; and at the same time to demonstrate that the interests of society at large are intimately associated with those of the practitioner; that in the present instance, in short, they are one and indivisible. I • His concluding words sufficiently indicate both the heat and the fre- quency with which the dispute was renewed : — " Cum luxe per multa volumina pcrque magna: conteniionis disputationes a medicis stepe tractata sint atquc trac- tentur, &c."—Cclsi prwfat.

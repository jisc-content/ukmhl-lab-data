They suppose the dissector is either differently constituted from other men, or that habit has so inured him to his pursuits as to cause them to yield some peculiar satisfaction distinct from that which flows from scientific investigations and disco- veries. Do, now, any of these same individuals imagine, if necessity compelled them to walk daily for a few months in the train of a nightman's cart, that their olfactories would eventually become enamoured of the odour proceeding therefrom? If not, possibly they may learn to acknow- ledge that the same sense cannot be much gratified in the anatomist. Should, however, any be still sceptical as to the truth of these matters, we most sincerely advise them to make the experiment. Considering the naturally uninviting and forbidding con- sequences of putrefaction, the risk of life which the opera- tor runs, the odium and prepossessions which he must brave, and still further, the difficulties and penalties with which dissection is fraught, the most prejudiced will surely believe that nothing but imperative necessity could perpetuate its practice.* And further, we may deduce this very impor- tant conclusion, that so far from placing any restrictions upon the cultivation of anatomy, it ought to be encouraged in the most free and unlimited manner possible; since, in its own nature, it presents inherent impediments to any abuses which may be anticipated from its unrestricted permission. Dissection can never prove the source of immorality or crime, except from the imposition of unnatural and impo- litic restraints. In no country on the earth, except our â€¢ Some who promised to become the brightest ornaments of our profession, men, at once admired for their talents and urbanity, have fallen early victims to their zeal for the acquirement of anatomical knowledge. The most assi- duous students in the schools of the metropolis, though they escape any in- jimous results from wounds, frequently suffer very severely from the continued inhalation of the noxious atmosphere of the dissecting room, and some are thus commonly cut off yearly.

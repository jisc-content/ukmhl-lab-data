79 But this is not all; still further privileges are coveted by himself in particular, with the view, it would seem, of se- curing a numerous attendance of pupils. On the other hand, we maintain, that the real interests of society, the due advancement of medical knowledge, can be properly promoted only by permitting every legal member of the profession to prosecute anatomy on his own premises; and further, that every one ought to be allowed to teach such as may choose to put themselves under his care. We repeat, the college is not, therefore, bound to admit the validity of every man's instruction. Indeed, it is notorious, that no certificates of attendance on courses relating to any branch of medicine, are admitted at Edinburgh, except such as have been obtained at a university. We do not argue, therefore, for any thing which would injure the in- terests or pecuniary emoluments of any class of men ; we are merely pleading for an important and unalienable right. Even the very protesters, who wish to limit the number of teachers, bestow on every graduate in their university, full, free, and complete power to teach, as well as to practise, me- dicine :â€”" lE,\queamplissi?nam jJOtcstatcm mcdicinam ubiquc gentium legendi, docendi,Jacicndi concessam," (subaudi tes- tatum volumns,) are the words employed on the occasion. If the teaching here mentioned do not extend to anatom}', as well as to other branches of the profession, then the phraseology is pretty much upon a par with that which immediately precedes it, than which nothing can be more ridiculous. We allude to the " ubiquc gentium" which re- solves its meaning into anywhere in Scotland, somewhere in England or Ireland, and nowhere abroad without previous j)crmission! It is high time, surely, to banish such anti- quated and grandiloquent nonsense; at least, it is somewhat inconsistent in those who annually invest a number of per- sons with the powers and privileges of teaching, to endeavour at the same time to prevent them from ennasrincr in that olhcc, even in the only metropolis, the " ubique gentium," where they have full permission to do so without molesta-

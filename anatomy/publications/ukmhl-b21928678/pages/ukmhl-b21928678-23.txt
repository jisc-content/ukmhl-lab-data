Paracelsus as unhesitatingly renounced the infallibility of Aristotle in philosophy, as did the Reformers that of the Romish doctors, angelic, cherubic, and seraphic, in matters of faith. He had, moreover, entered into the hitherto unknown and vast domains of experimental en- quiry.

Thus arose the Academia dei Linci at Rome, established by Prince Cesi, in 1603. The formation of the Parisian Academy and the Royal Society in London, soon followed.

It is, moreover, a sin- gular fact, and one which pre-eminently and forcibly illus- trates the truth of our remarks, that the Romans do not exhibit to us a single anatomist, and with one bright, but solitary exception, not even a philosophic physician. The profession was held in the lowest estimation; or, to speak more correctly, it was despised. And how could they re- gard its polluted members in any favourable light? Medi- cine, consequently, was left to be practised by slaves and sharpers, and hence Rome became the grand emporium of quacks and quackery. A few Greeks who resorted thither, were the only individuals that rose superiour to the empirics and rhizotomes with which the city was infested. These are circumstances which people would do well to reflect upon. But let us for a moment pursue the details of his- tory. With Aristotle* a new epoch in comparative anatomy commences. This celebrated philosopher must undoubt- edly be considered as the most distinguished zootomist among the ancients. By innumerable dissections pf an- imals, in which he was countenanced and encouraged by his renowned pupil, he both rectified former errors, and made many new discoveries. At the same time, this illus- trious individual regrets that so little is understood about the interiour structure of the frame of man, and openly com- plains of the prejudices which compel the anatomist to sub- stitute animals in the place of the human subject. Ardent as he was in the pursuit of science, Aristotle, it is clear, even aided and protected by an Alexander, could not ob- tain a human body for dissection. What, however, the zeal of this great man could not accomplish was shortly afterwards to be effected by others; and that, which it was impossible to practise even in secret, was now to be per- Â» 350 B.

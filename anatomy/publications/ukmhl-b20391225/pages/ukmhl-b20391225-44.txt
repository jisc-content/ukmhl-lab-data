The " lower por- tion^' supported by the levator ani, extends to the anus, and has no peritoneal covering. The Spleen is placed obliquely in the cavity of the abdomen, and lies on the left side, between the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs; its axis lying along the tenth rib. Its upper and posterior extremity is opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra, in the concavity of the diaphragm, and somewhat overlapped by the left lung; from here the spleen passes downwards and forwards, to end a little behind the extremity of the eleventh rib (i.e,^ opposite the first lumbar spine). Its superior and anterior border is parallel with the ninth rib, while the inferior and posterior border nearly follows the eleventh rib. The inner end is about \ \ inches from the median plane of the body, the outer nearly reaches the mid-axillary line. Normally the organ is not to be felt, and this is for two reasons, viz., the organ is, in the first place, too soft, and, in the second, too deeply placed. Should it enlarge sufficiently to project beyond the extremity of the eleventh rib, however, it can readily be made out by palpation.

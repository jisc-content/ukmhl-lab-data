43 THE SPLEEN. A good method of detecting the slighter degrees of enlargement is by placing one hand posteriorly, and tilting the organ up against the other hand placed over it anteriorly, or rather, antero-laterally. As the organ increases in size, it emerges from be- neath the margins of the ribs towards the umbilicus, and confirmatory evidence of the organ being splenic is furnished in some cases by the splenic notch being appreciable, and also by its moving with full respira- tions, and alterations in the position of the body; these points will serve to distinguish it from a kidney enlarge- ment. In determining the organ by percussion, this must be done very lightly, for, if the stomach and colon be distended by food or gas, it is w^ll-nigh impossible to do so. Percussion must be made between the mid- and posterior-axillary line. The spleen tends to fall towards the side on which the individual lies, and since it is necessary in percus- sing out the slighter degrees of enlargement that he lies on the right side, the splenic dulness may disappear; it is best, therefore, in these cases to let the patient stand up during the investigation.

32 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. is also covered by peritoneum, and has in front of it the abdominal parietes, and behind, the transverse colon at its commencement. The gall-bladder can occasionally be felt as a small tumour descending from the lower margin of the liver, in the position indicated, and gall stones may rarely be felt. The Position of the Liver relatively to the Parietes.â€” That part of the liver which reaches highest under the vaulted diaphragm is, of course, separated from the chest wall by a wedge of lung tissue, and this much of the organ can only be defined by a "relatively" dull note. In percussing therefore from above downwards on the right side, in the nipple line, the clear lung note usually becomes impaired at about the level of the superior border of the fifth rib (" upper limit of rela- tive hepatic dulness"), and here, in consequence, is the upper border of the liver. In percussing down- wards, for about three inches, one next comes to the commencement of complete dulness ("the absolute hepatic dulness"), and this corresponds of course with the inferior margin of the right lung, which has already been traced out. The thin lower margin is readily detected, on account of the tympanitic re- sonance of the adjacent organs ; it commences close to the cardiac apex, and descends to the right, midway between the ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus, meet-

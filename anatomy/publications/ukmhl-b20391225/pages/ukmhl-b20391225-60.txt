The ni?ith^ or Glosso-Pharyngeah.—The nuclei of these nerves are continuous behind with those of the vagus, and in front they are somewhat overlapped by the auditory nuclei. They emerge by a series of five or six roots, attached in a vertical line to the lateral surface of the medulla, the highest being close to the auditory nerves. These nerves give branches to the mucous membrane of the tongue, pharynx, and middle ear, as well as to one muscle—the stylo-pharyn- geus. The tenth^ 07' Vagus nerves,—Their nuclei are a continuation of the glosso-pharyngeal nuclei above, and of the accessory nuclei below. They lie immedi- ately external to the hypoglossal nuclei. The nerves emerge from the side of the medulla to the number of twelve or more, attached in a line which is continuous with that of the glosso-pharyngeal roots. These nerves supply branches to the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, liver, and spleen, also to the larynx, trachea, and lungs, and small offsets are given to the dura mater and external ear. Branches are also given to the heart and great vessels through the cardiac plexus, and to the remaining abdominal viscera through the solar plexus.

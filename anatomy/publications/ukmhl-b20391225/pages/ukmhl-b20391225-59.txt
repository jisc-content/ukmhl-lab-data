THE HEAD AND NECK. 57 through the substance of the pons, to issue just below that body, and immediately above the outer border of the pyramid of the medulla. They supply the external rectus muscles of the eyeball. The seventh^ or Facial nerves,â€”Their nuclei are at the same level as that of the sixth, but more deeply placed in the substance of the pons ; the upper end of the nucleus comes nearly in contact with the motor nucleus of the fifth, so that the two nuclei are often described as one; from this, the fibres pass backwards and inwards to the floor of the fourth ventricle. They emerge from the medulla oblongata, in the outer part of the depression between the olivary and the restiform bodies. These are the principal motor nerves of the head, for. they supply the muscles of the scalp, those of the exter- nal ear, the nose, mouth, and eyelids (except the levator palpebrae superioris) and the platysma; also the muscles of the tympanum, the levator palati, and azygos uvulse (through the large superficial petrosal nerve), and in the neck the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric. The eighth, or Auditory nerves^ have their nuclei in the floor of the fourth ventricle; the vagi nuclei are on their inner borders below, but higher up they over- lap the nuclei of the glosso-pharyngeal, and lie along- side the upper end of the nuclei of the hypoglossal. At the base of the brain the nerves appear on the outer

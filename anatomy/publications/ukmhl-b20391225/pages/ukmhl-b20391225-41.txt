THE INTESTINES. 39 being placed immediately behind a vertical line, be- ginning at the central point of the iliac crest. The transverse colon, at each of its extremities, is situated deeply towards the back part of the abdominal cavity, but in the middle it curves forwards, and lies close to the abdominal wall; it crosses the abdomen in the upper part of the umbilical region, the inferior border being generally at the umbilicus. The superior border, which is six centimetres higher, lies at a dis- tance of four centimetres below the sternum. In the V right and left hypochondriac regions the superior bor- der passes under the costal arch, being covered on the right side by the lower border of the thorax and the lower border of the liver, and, on the left, by the lower border of the thorax only. If the left half of the trans- verse colon and the upper part of the descending colon are full, the stomach being empty, a more or less dull percussion sound will be obtained over the lower part of the thorax on the left side, but above this there will be a tympanitic note up to the inferior border of the lung. If a part of the colon is empty, the stomach being full, a dull note will be obtained over the stomach, and a tympanitic note over the transverse and descend- ing colon,â€”that is, when the individual is in a stand- ing or sitting posture. When he is lying on his back, there will be a tympanitic note all over, with the ex- ception of course of the region of the spleen.

THE ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. INTRODUCTORY. The exact position of any organ, relatively to the parietes, is determined by means of four methods of examination—inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation; and it is advisable to adopt each of these methods in a routine manner. The order in which they are written is the most convenient. Inspection,— Place the patient in a good light, and in a convenient position. That most generally con- venient for all the four methods of examination is the supine one ; but where it is necessary to change this, to facilitate the examination, it will be mentioned through the book. It is a purely ocular examination, but it requires careful self-tuition, by which the student will find that he grows to notice more and more. Palpation.—It is only by much practice, and care- ful education of the sense of touch, that one can reap the best results from this method. The hand should be always warm, and placed flat (don't use the tips of the fingers!), with even and gradually increasing firm pressure, upon the part to be palpated.

14 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. ventricle), is uncovered by lung, and an " absolutely " dull note is obtainable. The " area of absolute cardiac dulness" is irregularly triangular, and " its greatest dimension, either in height or length, is between and 2 inches (40-54 millimetres)" (Jaccoud). It of course varies somewhat with respiration, but in quiet breathing, the base of the triangle runs a little to the right of the midsternal line, from the fourth to the sixth costal cartilages. A line stretching irregularly from the upper end of the base to the apex-beat, forms one side of the triangle; the other side can only be got approximately, owing to the liver dulness encroach- ing on that of the heart below; but the triangle can be sufficiently correctly finished by drawing a line from the level of the upper margin of absolute hepatic dulness, on the right side, to the apex-beat. It is not necessary, generally speaking, to map out exactly the '^relative cardiac dulness^'' for percussion in two directions suffices in the majority of casesâ€”first, along the line of the fourth rib, and secondly, in a ver- tical direction, parallel to the sternum, and about one inch to the left of its margin (to avoid the aorta). The left margin of the heart is marked accurately enough, for most cases, by the position of the apex- beat \ the right margin is usually nearly one inch to the right of the margin of the sternum. Percussing from above downwards, the lung note gets impaired

THE LUNGS. 21 The Lungs. When dealing with the lungs it is necessary, to facilitate localisation and reference, to map out the thorax into a series of small regions. These are : I. A Median or Sternal Groups bounded on each side by the lateral border of the sternum. a. The supra-sternal notch. b. The superior sternal region. The inferior sternal region. The latter two are separated by a line along the level of the lower border of the third costal cartilage. II. An Antero-Lateral Groups bounded internally by the lateral sternal border, and externally by a line which commences at the first ring of the trachea, and runs diagonally outwards to the acromion process, and then falls vertically downwards. a. The supra-clavicular region. b. The clavicular—corresponds to the inner half of clavicle. The infra-clavicular—from the clavicle to the lower border of the third rib. d. The mammary—from the lower border of the third rib to the sixth rib. e. The infra-mammary—from the sixth rib downwards.

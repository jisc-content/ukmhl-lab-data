25 THE LUNGS. In the axillary line a difference of over three inches can be made out between a full inspiration and a full expiration in the inferior margins of the lungs. In percussing the front of the chest from above downwards a clear note is obtained, until we reach the liver dulness on the right side (the upper border of the fifth rib), and the relative cardiac dulness on the left side. In percussing posteriorly, make the patient bend forwards and cross the arms in front, the scapulae are then separated to the utmost. The tympanitic lung note is obtainable down to the tenth or eleventh rib. In the axillary regions the lung note ceases below at the liver dulness on the right side, and at that of the spleen on the left. The note on the right side is usually slightly duller than that on the left, owing to the usually superior muscular development on that side. The PleurcB.â€”The extent of the pleura is greater than that of the lung which it covers, except after the greatest possible inspiration; and it can be roughly mapped out by following the margins of the lungs, and exceeding these by a little under an inch. Inferiorly the pleurae do not quite reach the attach- ments of the diaphragm, but leave a portion of its circumference in contact with the costal parietes. The limits of the pleurae vary a little on the two

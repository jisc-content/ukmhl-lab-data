THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. 9 of the Sternum, and broader below, the pleurae reced- ing. It is bounded in front by the sternum, with the fifth and sixth and a portion of the seventh left costal cartilages, and by the triangularis sterni muscle; be- hind it is the pericardium. Its contents are simply some areolar tissue, and two or three lymphatic glands at its lowermost part. The posterior mediastinum is bounded anteriorly by the pericardium and the roots of both lungs, posteriorly by the dorsal vertebrae below the fourth, laterally by the lungs and pleurae. Its contents areâ€”the descend- ing aorta, the vagi nerves, the venae azygos, the thoracic duct, and some lymphatic glands. The operation of Paracentesis Thoracis is a " medi- cal operation," and its anatomy should be mentioned here. The trochar is usually entered in the fifth inter- space (sometimes the sixth), at the line of insertion of the serratus magnus, or mid-axillary line, or else more posteriorly, i.e.^ just below the inferior angle of the scapula. It must be remembered that the inter- costal artery runs along near the lower border of the upper rib. Unless considerable force is used, the thickened pleura may not be penetrated, but simply driven before the trochar. Paracentesis pericardii." Best point for puncture, 5th left intercostal space, about 2 or in. from the mid-sternal line.

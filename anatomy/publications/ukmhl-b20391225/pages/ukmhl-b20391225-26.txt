The Left Lung is divided into two lobes by a fissure running obliquely inwards and upwards from the outer surface, to within a short distance of the root. It is somewhat narrower and longer than the right, narrower on account of the heart on the left side, longer because the liver lifts the diaphragm a little higher on the right. The relative position of the fissure is that of a line beginning behind, at the second dorsal spine, running downwards and forwards round the chest, and reaching the sixth rib in the mammillary line. The amount of lung above and below this line, represents the upper and lower lobes respectively. The Right Lung has two fissures dividing it into three lobes : one passing from above the middle of the external surface, and the other from near its lower end, both converging towards the root. The three lobes are mapped out externally by drawing lines following the courses of the fissures. One such line begins be- hind at the second dorsal spine, runs downwards and forwards round the chest, reaching the sixth rib in the nipple line ; the other begins from a point in the middle of the line last described, and extends to opposite the fourth chondro-sternal articulation.

20 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. Course and Relations of the CEsophagus,â€”The ceso- phagus, from its commencement, opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, inclines at first somewhat to the left, but regains the middle line, opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra, and finally deviates once more to the left, terminating opposite the tenth or eleventh dorsal vertebra, by opening into the stomach. That part in the neck has in front the trachea, and lower down, the thyroid gland and thoracic duct. Be- hind, it lies against the longus colli muscle, while on either side are the common carotids, and the recur- rent laryngeal nerves, coursing up between it and the trachea. That part in the thorax has in front of it, from above downwards, the trachea, the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and the arch of the aorta, the left bronchus, the posterior surface of the pericardium. Behind, the longus colli muscle, below this the inter- costal vessels, and near the diaphragm, the front of the aorta, separate it from the vertebral column. Laterally it is covered by pleura, and has the vena azygos major on the right side, and the descending aorta on the left. The right vagus passes down behind it, the left in front of it.

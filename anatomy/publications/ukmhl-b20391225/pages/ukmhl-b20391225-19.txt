THE HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. I? side than on the right, by the pleura and lung, and is placed immediately in front, and to the left of the trachea, the oesophagus, and thoracic duct. Running along its upper border is the left innominate vein, and from here are given off the large branches of the in- nominate, the left carotid, and left subclavian. The lower concave border of this portion overhangs the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and is connected with the left branch of that artery by the obliterated ductus arteriosus. It is crossed in front by the left vagus, left phrenic, and superficial cardiac nerves, as well as by the left superior intercostal vein; and the recurrent laryngeal nerve turns upwards, beneath and behind it. The Descending Portion rests against the left side of the body of the fifth dorsal vertebra, and is covered by the left pleura and lung. To the right side of this part of the aortic arch, is the oesophagus, with the thoracic duct. The Innominate Artery (from i J to 2 inches in length) ascends obliquely to the right sterno-clavicular articu- lation. It is separated from the sternum by the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and the remains of the thymus gland; and, lower down, by the left in- nominate vein, which crosses the artery at its root. Its lower part lies in front of the trachea, the upper against the pleura; on its left side is the left carotid B

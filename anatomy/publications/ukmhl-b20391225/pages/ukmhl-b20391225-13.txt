THE HEART *AND GREAT VESSELS. 11 apex beat; horizontally, at the level of the fourth rib, it extends from a vertical mid-sternal line, i J inches to the right, and 3^ inches to the left. At the level of the fourth rib there is the greatest transverse dimension of the heart. Here it projects beyond the median sternal line, an average of 8 to 9 centimetres to the left, 4 to the right, according to Luschka. To delineate the heart accurately, draw a line down- wards, from the centre of the second right interspace half an inch from the margin of the sternum, describing as it descends a pronounced curve, the maximum of the bulge being at the level of the fourth right cartilage, where it is one inch from the margin of the sternum. Continue the curve to the lower border of the fifth cartilage, just at its junction with the sternum, and from this point round the base of the sternum to about half an inch outside the apex beat. If the line be carried up from here, with an outward convexity to a point in the middle of the second left space one inch from the sternum, the outline of the heart will have been defined, with the exception of the base. This is got by drawing a transverse line connecting the two free ends of the tracing. Such a line is just below the level of the inferior borders of the second cartilages (right and left), and corresponds posteriorly to the level of the lower part of the body of the fifth dorsal vertebra. Within these limitsâ€”

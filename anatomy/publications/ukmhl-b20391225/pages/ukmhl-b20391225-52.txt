It is covered by the lesser omentum, and has on its right side the right semi-lunar ganglion and lobus Spigelii; on its left, the left semi-lunar ganglion, and cardiac end of the stomach ; and below, it rests on the upper border of the pancreas. The superior mesenteric is immediately below this. The renal arteries come off opposite the first lum- bar vertebra, that is, three and a half inches above the umbilicus. The inferior ??iesenteric is given off one inch above the umbilicus, and slightly to the left of the middle line. The Common Iliacs extend from the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra to the sacro- iliac synchondrosis, and are from two to two and a half inches in length.

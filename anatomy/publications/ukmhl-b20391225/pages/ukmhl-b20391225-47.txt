THE PANCREAS—THE KIDNEYS. 45 The body is covered in front by the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon, and the posterior surface of the stomach. The posterior surface has the follow- ing in relation with it: (/.^., between it and the first lumbar vertebra)—the superior mesenteric vessels, the commencement of the vena porta, the vena cava, the aorta, the left kidney and supra-renal capsule, and the corresponding renal vessels. The upper border is in relation with the caeliac axfs, the splenic artery and vein, and to the right the first part of the duodenum and the hepatic artery. The lower border has the superior mesenteric vessels be- tween it and the transverse part of the duodenum; to the left of these the inferior mesenteric vein ascends behind the pancreas to join the splenic vein. The Kidneys occupy on each side a part of the lumbar, hypochon- driac, epigastric, and umbilical regions. On the left side the lower margin of the organ reaches to about two inches from the iliac crest, that is, a little below the level of the second lumbar spine, or just above that of the umbilicus; the upper margin reaches to the level of the eleventh rib or eleventh dorsal spine. The right kidney is situated a little lower than the left, say from half to three-quarters of an inch.

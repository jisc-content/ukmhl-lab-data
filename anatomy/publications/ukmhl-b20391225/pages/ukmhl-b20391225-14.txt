12 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. The Right Auricle lies behind the third, fourth, and fifth cartilages at their sternal ends, their correspond- ing interspaces, and the right edge of the sternum. The Left Auricle extends from just below the lower border of the second left costal cartilage to the upper margin of the sternal end of the fourth'(" upper border of the third cartilage," Jaccoud). The Right Ventricle reaches from the third to the sixth left cartilages. The Left Ventricle extends from the upper border of the third left cartilage to the middle of the fifth, or even to the sixth rib. Its external border corresponds nearly enough to the line of insertion of the ribs (from the third to the sixth) with their cartilages. The Position of the Valves,â€”The position of the mitral valve corresponds to a line drawn through the sternal end of the third left costal cartilage, at a dis- tance of about two-thirds of an inch from its junction with the sternum, and reaching from the upper margin of the cartilage down the intercostal space beneath. The Tricuspid Valve corresponds to a line drawn obliquely across the sternum, in the direction of, from the lowest part of the third left intercostal space to the fifth right costal cartilage; the two ends of which line would not quite reach the lateral margins of the ster- num. The valve is, therefore, on a level with the fourth space.

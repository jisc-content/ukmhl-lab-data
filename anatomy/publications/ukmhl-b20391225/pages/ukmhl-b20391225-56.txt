The upper end of the furrow of Rolando is half an inch behind a point midway between the root of the nose and the external occipital protuberance; its lower end is close to the posterior limb, and about one inch behind the bifurcation, of the fissure of Sylvius. As those cases in which the cranial nerves are affected, either by paralysis or irritation, generally fall within the domain of the physician, a digest of their deep origin, position at the base of the brain, and function, compiled from Quain, is given for reference. This knowledge is essential in order to localise the exact seat of an intracranial tumour, etc. Following a classification into twelve cranial netwes : The first cranial^ or Olfactory nerves,â€”These nerves furnish the sense of smell; the olfactory bulbs lie along the under surface of the frontal lobe, and the fibres which pass from them run directly downwards, through the perforations in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. Their deep origins remain uncertain. The second^ or Optic nerves^ originate in the geni- culate bodies, the posterior part of the thalami, and the anterior quadrigeminal bodies. They are seen on the base of the brain to course round the crura

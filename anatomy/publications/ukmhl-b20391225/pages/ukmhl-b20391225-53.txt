The right common iliac has in front of it, the small intestines (end of ileum and caecum), the peritoneum, the sympathetic nerves, and it is crossed by the ureter near its termination ; to its outer side, is the right common iliac vein, and the commencement of the inferior vena cava. The left com7?ion iliac has in front, the rectum and sigmoid flexure, the peritoneum, the sympathetic nerves, and is crossed by the ureter near its termina- tion, and also by the inferior mesenteric vessels; to its inner side, is the left common iliac vein. The external iliac runs along the brim of the true pelvis, and its course is indicated by the lower two- thirds of a line drawn from a point three fourths of an inch below, and a little to the left of the umbili- cus, to a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ileum, and the symphysis pubis. It has in relation with it, intestines, peritoneum, and the spermatic vessels, the vas deferens, the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the external iliac vein. The internal iliac passes from the sacro-iliac syn- chondrosis downwards almost immediately into the pelvis, and it divides at the level of the great sacro- sciatic notch.

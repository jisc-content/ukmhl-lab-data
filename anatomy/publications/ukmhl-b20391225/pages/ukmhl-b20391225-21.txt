THE HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 19 commencement, is the corresponding coronary artery, and close to its sides, the two auricular appendages. It at first lies in front of the origin of the aorta, but higher up, where it lies in front of the left auricle, it passes to the left side of the ascending aorta, and is finally placed below the transverse portion of the arch. The obliterated ductus arteriosus connects it with the under surface of the aortic arch. The right pulmon- ary artery runs nearly transversely to the right, behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava, into the root of the right lung, where it divides. The left passes horizontally in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus, into the root of the left lung. The Descending Thoracic Aorta extends from the lower margin of the fifth dorsal vertebra, on the left side, to the front of the last dorsal vertebra, and has therefore a general inward inclination in its whole length. It lies in the posterior mediastinum, resting against the spine, and covered in front by the root of the left lung and the pericardium; on the left side, it is in contact with the corresponding pleura and lung; and close to it, on the right side, are the azygos vein, the thoracic duct, and the oesophagus. The oesopha- gus, however, towards the lower part of the thorax, is in front of the artery, and near the diaphragm gets somewhat to the left side. The small azygos vein lies behind the descending thoracic aorta.

56 ESSENTIALS OF MP:DICAL ANATOMY. smaller motor part, and a larger sensory. They emerge from the sides of the pons Varolii, nearer to the upper than to the lower border. The nucleus of the motor root lies just below the lateral angle of the fourth ventricle, immediately in advance of the facial nucleus, and mesial to the large sensory nucleus of the fifth. This part supplies chiefly the muscles of mastication. The nucleus of the sensory root arises to the outer side of the motor nucleus; it imparts common sensi- bility to the face and the fore part of the head, as well as to the eye, the nose, the ear, and the mouth (including the greater portion of the tongue, and the upper part of the pharynx). It may possibly also con- fer the power of taste upon the forepart of the tongue. This nerve has three great divisionsâ€” the ophthalmic, the superior maxillary, and the inferior maxillary; the area of supply of the ophthalmic divisions reaches, roughly speaking, down from the upper and front part of the hairy scalp to the level of the lower margin of the eyeball (the lower lid is supplied by the second division); that of the superior maxillary reaches from here down to level of the upper teeth, inclusive ; that of the inferior maxillary extends to the lower border of the inferior maxilla. llie sixths or Abducent nerves^ arise from a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle; their fibres run

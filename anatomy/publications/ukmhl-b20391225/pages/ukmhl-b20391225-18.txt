The Left Innominate Vein^ running along the top of the aortic arch, is just below the upper margin of the sternum. Sometimes in children the left innominate vein is visible in the neck, the arch of the aorta being higher than usual. Of the Aortic Arch, the most important relations of the vessels are : The Ascending Portion.â€”At its commencement, it is in contact anteriorly with the root of the pulmonary artery, and with the right auricular appendix, but higher up, as it ascends to the right, it approaches very near the sternum, being only separated by the pericardium, the right pleura, and by the thin anterior margin of the right lung. On the right side is the superior vena cava, and, lower down, the right auricle. On the left, the root of the pulmonary artery.

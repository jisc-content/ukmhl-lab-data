A line drawn from one orifice to the other, round the ensiform cartilage, will indicate the lesser curvature. The great curvature, starting from behind the apex-beat, runs downwards, and slightly inwards, to the level of a line joining the tips of the ninth ribs (which is also the line separating the um- bilical from the epigastric region), and from this lowest point it curves with a slight outward convexity up to the pyloric orifice. Relative Anatomy,â€”The stomach lies immediately behind the anterior abdominal wall, above the trans- verse colon, and below the liver and diaphragm. Its pyloric end lies in contact with the abdominal wall, the under surface of the liver, and the neck of the gall- bladder. Its anterior surface looks upwards and forwards, and is in relation with the diaphragm, the under sur- face of the left lobe of the liver, and the abdominal parietes in the epigastric region. The posterior surface lies against the pancreas and great vessels of the abdomen, the crura of the dia- phragm, and the solar plexus; also, on the left side, the kidney and its supra-renal capsule, and the spleen.

THE HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. IJ The Aortic Valves lie horizontally, and correspond to a line drawn from the middle of the junction of the third left costal cartilage to the mid-sternum. The Pulmonary Valves lie parallel to the aortic, but slightly higher, and more to the left, being on a level with the upper border of the third cartilage (left). The sounds produced at these orifices are best heard, however, not immediately over them, but over an area on the chest-wall, where the cavity receiving the vi- brating blood, approaches nearest the surface. Mitral sounds are best heard over an area an inch in diameter over the apex beat, for it is only here that the left ventricle comes in contact with the chest-wall. Tricuspid,—Over the lower part of the sternum, par- ticularly the left border, from the fourth to the sixth cartilages. Aortic.—The aorta reaches nearest the chest-wall^ opposite the second right costal cartilage, and there> fore the " aortic area " is here. The Pulmonary is over the third left costal cartilagey or slightly higher. The limits of the organ are ascertained by percus- sion, and the clinically appreciable limit falls a little short of what anatomy teaches us. The greater part of the heart is covered anteriorly by the lungs, and over this, therefore, only a " relatively " dull note can be got; a small part, however (consisting of the right

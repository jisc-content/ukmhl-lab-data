THE LIVER. 33 ing the margin of the ribs in the mammillary Hne ; from this point, backwards to the axillary line, it exceeds, by half an inch as a rule, the lower margins of the ribs. The liver behind, opposite the tenth and eleventh dorsal vertebrae, is uncovered by lung, and this corres- ponds to the Spigelian lobe. The average dimensions of the different segments of the organ are : In the median line, 5'62 centimetres. „ mammillary ,, 12*64 „ axillary, „ 10-57 „ scapular „ 9*11 „ (Monneret.) Relative Anatomy.—The upper surface, covered by peritoneum, is exactly moulded to the under surface of the diaphragm. The under surface, also invested with peritoneum, lies, as to the left lobe, on the subjacent cardiac part of the stomach, and over that part of the anterior surface of the stomach next to the lesser cur- vature. The under surface of the right lobe is divided by the gall bladder and its fossa into two unequal parts. Of these, the lateral one is by far the larger, and rests upon the hepatic flexure of the colon anteriorly, and the right kidney posteriorly. The mesial one is im- mediately over the pyloric end of the stomach, and the commencement of the duodenum. The posterior surface comprehends :—a portion of the left lobe, which lies immediately in front of the c

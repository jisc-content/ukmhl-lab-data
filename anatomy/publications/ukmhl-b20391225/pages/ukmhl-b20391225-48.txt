46 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. The internal margin lies next to the spinal column, the outer is parallel to, and about two and a half inches from it. Normally (with the exception of the right in rare cases) they cannot be palpated, and it is only when, from loose attachments, they escape from their posi- tions, as in " floating kidney," or are considerably en- larged, that this is practical. A floating kidney " is diagnosed from its kidney-shape and size, its great mobility, and rarely the renal artery, entering the hilus, can be felt pulsating; if the organ be grasped, a dull, sickening pain is elicited. When greatly enlarged, the tympanitic note of the colon occupies the vertical middle line of nephritic dulness. The method of per- cussion here does not avail us much, for the upper mar- gins pass into the hepatic and splenic dulness, the inner lie close to the vertebral column, and the lower only just above the iliac crest. These latter can, in some cases, be made out, but generally speaking this is only possible with the outer borders, and the following is the best method to effect this :â€”Lay the individual prone, and support the anterior surface of the abdomen by cushions, then mark out the lower limits of the hepatic and splenic dulnesses in the scapular line on their respective sides. Just below these levels the tympanitic note of the colon or stomach can be made out, and now percuss inwards, when the renal dulness

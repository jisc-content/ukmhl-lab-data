lo essentials of medical anatomy. The Heart and Great Vessels. The heart in general form resembles a blunt cone. It is placed obliquely in the chest, so that nearly two-thirds of it are found on the left side of the mid-sternum ; its broad base being directed upwards, backwards, and to the right, its blunt apex downwards, forwards, and to the left. As it lies in situ^ its four chambers have the following relative positions:—The right and left auricles form its base; the right auricle lying anteriorly and to the right, the left wholly posteriorly and to the left (this auricle is covered in front by the interlace- ment of the aorta and pulmonary arteries). The right ventricle forms the chief part of the anterior surface of the heart, and its right border; it forms also a small part of the posterior surface, the rest of this consisting of the left ventricle, which, in addition, forms the left border of the heart, and a small part of the anterior surface. The apex is entirely formed by the left ven- tricle, and is most appreciable over an area one square inch in extent, in the fifth left interspace, two inches from the left margin of the sternum, or half an inch internal to the mammillary line. Its Position relatively to the Thoracic Wall.—That part of the chest-wall which lies over the heart is called the ''''Precordial Region'' Its greatest measurements are:—vertically, from the second interspace to the

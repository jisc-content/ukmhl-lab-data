l8 ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. artery below, and the trachea above; and to the right is the corresponding innominate vein. Part of the left common carotid, and the left subcla- vian arteries, lie in the thorax, and their relations there are : The Thoracic Part of the Left Co?nmon Carotid.—It ascends obliquely behind, and at some distance from the upper piece of the sternum, and the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles; it is covered in front by the remains of the thymus, and is crossed by the left innominate vein. This part of the artery lies at first over the trachea, and then over the oesophagus. The thoracic duct is also behind it. The vagus is to its outer side. The Thoracic Part of the Left Subclaviaji A^'tery.— It is at first overlapped by the left lung, and is covered in front, and on the left side, by the pleura; it rests, for a little, on the oesophagus, and the thoracic duct. To the right side of the vessel is, at first, the trachea, and, higher up, the oesophagus, and thoracic duct. The left innominate vein is anterior to it, and passing down in front is the left vagus. The phrenic nerve descends to the left of this part of the artery. The Pulmonary Artery,—The main pulmonary ar- tery arises from the right ventricle, and passes for two inches upwards and backwards to the concavity of the aortic arch, where it divides. On each side, at its

37 THE INTESTINES. The Small Intestine, Le.^ The Duodenum Jejunum and Ileum. The intestines, below the stomach, are covered more or less completely by the great omentum. The coils of the small intestine occupy the anterior and middle part of the abdomen, below a horizontal line at the level of the umbilicus; those of the jejunum being principally above, and those of the ileum below. The Duodenum is the beginning of the small in- testine ; it commences at the pylorus, and is arranged in a horse-shoe form, which embraces the head of the pancreas, far back in front of the vertical column. The first^ or ascending portion^ it will be remem- bered, rises from the pylorus upwards, backwards, and to the right, as far as the neck of the gall-bladder. It is two inches in length, and completely covered by peritoneum. Above, and in front of it, are the liver and neck of the gall-bladder, and behind it are the vessels running between the layers of the lesser omen- tum hepatic artery and duct, and the vena porta). The second^ or descending portion^ is three inches in length, and covered only by peritoneum on its an- terior surface; it extends from the neck of the gall- bladder, straight down in front of the right kidney, to the level of the third lumbar vertebra. In front of it

PREFACE. I COMPILED the greater part of the material of this little Manual while a student; and the fact that it was eagerly copied and appreciated by some of my co-students, has encouraged me to publish it. My object has been to keep the book within the limits of a pocket manual, to facilitate reference ; and, for that reason, I pre-suppose a good knowledge of general anatomy, and only give so much of " medical" anatomy as it is essential to know. All diagrams have been purposely excluded, for each organ can be mapped out (from the information supplied in the Manual), by a soft crayon, on the living subject. Such a diagram is far easier remembered, and the practical manner in which the work is thereby learnt, amply repays one. The notes on " Relative Anatomy " have been com- piled from Quain's and Gray's Anatomy. H. R. K.

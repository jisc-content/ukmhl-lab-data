The Lateral Group corresponds to the axilla, being bounded anteriorly by the vertical acromion line, which limits the antero-lateral group, and pos- teriorly by the axillary border of the scapula. a. Axillary region. b. Infra-axillary—separated from the former by a horizontal line at the level of the sixth rib. IV. The Posterior Group.—Bounded externally by the axillary border of the scapula, and internally by the middle line posteriorly. a. Supra-scapular. b. Supra-spinous—corresponds to supra-spinous fossa. c. Infra-spinous—corresponds to infra-spinous fossa. , d. Infra-scapular. e. Inter-scapular. The Position of the Lungs relatively to the Thoracic Wall,—The lungs during life are always in accurate contact with the internal surface of the thoracic wall. Each lung is irregularly conical, with its broad, semi- lunar base resting on the diaphragm. The blunt apices, which are separated from the first portion of the sub- clavian artery (which grooves them) by the pleura, reach to the height of a point about to 2 inches (3 to 5 centimetres, Leitz) above the clavicle, between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid. They may be mapped

THE HEART AND GREAT VESSELS. 15 no higher than the lower edge of the third cartilage, whereas the heart reaches nearly to the height of the lower border of the second cartilages. It is important to remember the anatomy of the Great Vessels in the Thorax^ in order to account for the various symptoms of aneurism, etc., and the student is often asked about them in his final examinations in medicine. They will therefore be included here. Their relative positions to the chest-wall are : The Aorta^ tracing it from the positions of its valve (vide ante J, ascends to the right of the sternum, opposite the second cartilage, and then, crossing the middle line one inch above the supra-sternal notch, where it lies on the bifurcation of the trachea, it returns to the left side, and descends to reach the back, opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra. The aortic dulness exists, in the normal condition, only as a small rounded projec- tion, from the upper border of the relative cardiac dulness; it rises as high as the upper margin of the second costal cartilage. Opposite the middle of the manubrium, the hinomi- nate and Left Common Carotid arteries arise, close to- gether from the aortic arch, and run upwards, the innominate to the right, and the carotid to the left sterno-clavicular articulation. The arterial cone, from whence emerges the pulmon- ary artery, ascends along the left border of the sternum,

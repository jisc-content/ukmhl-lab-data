The descending colon lies in the hinder part of the left hypochondriac and lumbar regions, and descends along the outermost part of the left kidney to the iliac fossa, where it ends in the sigmoid flexure; the part in contact with the abdominal wall follows behind a vertical line starting from the centre of the iliac crest on the left side. The sig?noid flexure may be detected by deep pressure in the left iliac region, as it passes over the brim of the pelvis, in thin persons, even when com- paratively empty; if distended with faeces, it forms a distinct tumour in this situation.

It is covered by the peritoneum in front, below, and at the sides, but has none behind as a rule, where it is attached by areolar tissue to the fascia, covering the right iliacus muscle. The ascending colon commences at the caecum opposite the ileo-c^cal valve. The peritoneum covers its anterior surface and sides, and sometimes passes nearly round it. It is overlaid in front by some of the convolutions of the ileum, and posteriorly it is con- nected by areolar tissue to the quadratus lumborum

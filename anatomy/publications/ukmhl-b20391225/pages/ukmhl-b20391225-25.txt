THE LUNGS. 23 out by drawing a curved line, convex upwards, follow- ing at first the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, and carried over to meet the anterior border of tra- pezius, and then downwards and backwards to the seventh cervical spine. A resonant note is often obtained two inches above the clavicle, but only by percussing in a downward direction upon the apex. The anterior margins gradually approach each other until, at the level of the second cartilage, the pleurae alone separate them; from this point they run down the middle of the sternum, parallel to each other, as far as the fourth cartilage. The right lung continues in the same direction, as far down as the sixth cartilage; but the left, which is deeply notched for the reception of the apex of the heart, runs outwards, and follows the upper line of the absolute cardiac dulness. The lower margins of the lungs, of course, vary with respiration, but they are sufficiently correctly mapped out by a line drawn obliquely round the sides of the thorax, from the sternal articulation of the sixth car- tilage, to the spine of the tenth dorsal vertebra (i.e.^ the eleventh rib). Such a line traverses the lower border of the sixth rib in the mammillary line (a vertical line through the nipple), the eighth rib in the axillary line (opposite the posterior fold), a point between the ninth and tenth ribs in the scapular line (a line carried ver-

THE STOMACH. 35 When the stomach is distended, the great curvature is elevated, and at the same time carried forwards, whilst the anterior surface is turned upwards, and the posterior surface downwards (Braune). Its relative position to the Parietes,â€”This is not influenced by respiration. If the organ be full of food, it is impossible to define it, but, under favourable circumstances, it is easy to distinguish its long and low- pitched percussion note from those in the neighbour- hood. Owing to the position of the stomach, it is only possible to define satisfactorily the line of the great curvature, and this is facilitated by first making out the surrounding organs. The normal stomach note should not be heard half-an-inch beyond the niiddle vertical line of the abdomen, or lower down than the level of the umbilicus. In mapping out the organ, it is convenient to first localise the two orifices. The cardiac orifice, placed far back, in front and to the left of the body of the ninth dorsal vertebra, lies behind the seventh costal cartilage, one inch to the left of the sternum. The pylorus is from two to three inches below, and a little to the right of, the base of the ensiform cartilage (about on a level with the cartilage of the eighth rib); posteriorly, it corresponds to the right side of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. If the stomach be not dis-

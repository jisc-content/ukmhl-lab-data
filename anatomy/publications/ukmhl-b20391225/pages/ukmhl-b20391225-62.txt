6o ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL ANATOMY. The medical man is often called upon to perform tracheotomy or laryngotomy, and the following points should be borne in mind:—Tracing down the struc- tures in the middle line of the neck from above down- wards, one comes upon successively :—just below the symphysis of the lower jaw the central tendon of the mylo-hyoid, then the body of the hyoid bone, the thyro-hyoid membrane, the thyroid cartilage, the crico- thyroid membrane and arteries (laryngotomy is per- formed through this membrane), the cricoid cartilage, two or three rings of the trachea, the isthmus of the thyroid gland (usually crossing opposite the third ring of the trachea), and the trachea again. (Tracheotomy is performed through the trachea either above or below the isthmus of the thyroid.) The rima glottidis is opposite the middle of the short anterior margin of the thyroid cartilage; the lower border of the cricoid cartilage indicates the ter- mination of the pharynx and larynx, and the com- mencement of the oesophagus and trachea; this corre- sponds posteriorly to the level of the interval between the sixth and seventh cervical spines. The external jugular vein is sometimes opened for venesection (/>., in infantile croup, apoplexy, or ex- treme venous congestion of the brain or chest). If made prominent, it can be seen to commence near the angle of the jaw, and to descend nearly vertically be-

THE HEAD AND NECK. 59 The eleventh^ or Spinal accessories.â€”These arise partly in the floor of the fourth ventricle from the continua- tion downwards of the vagi nuclei, and partly along the whole extent of the cervical portion of the spinal cord. It is the former part which joins and is distri- buted along with the vagi; the latter part is accessory to the cervical spinal nerves, and supplies the sterno- mastoid and trapezius. The nerves emerge as a long series of roots, the upper of which are attached to the side of the medulla in a line with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves below, and the roots of the vagi above; while the lower emerge from the lateral column of the spinal cord. The twelfth^ or Hypoglossals^ have their deep origin in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and emerge by a series of fine roots at the furrow between the pyramid and the olive. They supply either alone, or with branches of the spinal nerves, all the muscles con- nected with the hyoid bone, including those of the tongue, but with the exception of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid, the mylo-hyoid, and the middle constrictor of the pharynx. They also supply the sterno-thyroid muscles.

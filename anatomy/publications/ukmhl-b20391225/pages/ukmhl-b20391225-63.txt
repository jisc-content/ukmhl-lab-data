THE HEAD AND NECK. 61 neath the platysma and skin (the fibres of the former running nearly parallel with the vein), crossing the sterno-mastoid obliquely, and reaching the posterior border of that muscle below. Near the clavicle it per- forates the fascia, and terminates most frequently in the subclavian vein. Arteriotomy is sometimes performed on the anterior branch of the temporal arteries, especially in eye affec- tions. This artery can be felt to pulsate about one and a quarter inches behind the external angular process of the frontal bone. The common carotid artery may be compressed opposite the cricoid cartilage, against the prominent anterior tubercle on the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. In the angle between the sterno-mastoid and the clavicle, the pulsations of the third part of the sub- clavian artery can be felt, and its circulation can be stopped by pressing downwards and backwards against the first rib. The artery arches up to from half an inch to one inch above the clavicle, and the pleura and lung fit into the arch thus formed. The vein lies lower, and is under cover of the clavicle. For galvanization of the phrenic nerves, it should be remembered that these cross obliquely the anterior surfaces of the two scalenus anticus muscles, to reach their anterior margins low down ; they then cross the

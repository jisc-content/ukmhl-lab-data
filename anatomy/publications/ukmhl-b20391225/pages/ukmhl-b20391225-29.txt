27 THE ABDOMEN. the undivided portion of the bronchus is altogether above the right pulmonary artery; on the left side, it extends to below the level of the left pulmonary artery, which crosses it. On both sides the pulmonary veins are below their corresponding arteries. The Thoracic Portion of the Trachea bifurcates oppo- site the body of the fifth dorsal vertebra. It is covered in front by the manubrium sterni, with the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscle, lower down by the left in- nominate vein, then by the commencement of the in- nominate artery and the left carotid, which pass round to its sides, and lastly by the arch of the aorta, and the deep cardiac plexus of nerves.

THE ABDOMEN. The abdomen, for clinical purposes, is divided into nine regions by two horizontal and two vertical lines. The horizontal lines are described, one at the level of the lowermost part of the thoracic wall on each side (the lower margin of the ninth rib), and the other at the level of the highest points of the iliac crests. The two vertical lines on either side pass upwards from the

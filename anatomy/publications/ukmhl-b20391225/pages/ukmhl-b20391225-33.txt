THE LIVER. 31 The Liver Lies for the most part under cover of the ribs, and in healthy adults its lower margin is seldom to be felt projecting from below them on the right side, even in very thin subjects, whereas in children it is generally an easy matter. In percussing, it should be borne in mind that the organ moves with respiration, and with changes in position of the individual. A deep inspira- tion will considerably depress its usual percussion limits. Normally, only the left lobe of the liver can be made out by palpation, giving rise, as it does, to a slight feeling of resistance in the epigastric region. The extent of the lower border, unless considered in conjunction with that of its upper border, is no guide to the size of the organ, for pathological con- ditions of the lungs will depress the liver as a whole, or allow it, on the other hand, to rise. The Gall Bladder is situated behind, and sometimes projects a little beyond, the tip of the ninth cartilage, just at the outer edge of the rectus, on the right side. Its upper surface lies against the under surface of the " right lobe of the liver. Its under surface, covered by peritoneum, has the first part of the duodenum, the hepatic flexure of the colon, and sometimes the pyloric end of the stomach, in relation with it. The fundus

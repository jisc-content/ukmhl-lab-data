THE BONES AND JOINTS. 223 the horizontal position. If traction is exerted upon both legs, while the pelvis is held in a fixed position, it will be seen that these increase in length. Both active and passive movements are easily executed; only those of abduction and rotation being somewhat restricted. (A more ac- curate description of this case will be found in the dissertation of Niko- laus Cicei, entitled: “Zur Kenntniss der Congenitalen Hiiftgelenkluxa- tionen.” Munich, 1884.) injuries which involve extensive portions of the joint, and abnormal dilatation (of a permanent character) of the capsular ligament of the joint. As regards the localization of traumatic dislocations it is worthy of remark that ninety-two per cent of them involve the upper extremity, only five per cent the lower, and nearly three per cent the trunk. Acute Inflammation of Joints. This disease occurs in various degrees of severity, which are characterized by corresponding changes in the quality of the exudation. The latter is either serous in character (as in inflammatory dropsy of a joint), or sero-fibrinous, or purulent. In acute articular rheumatism (polyarthritis rlieu- matica acuta) several joints are almost always affected. In addition to the presence of swelling and moderate redness of the lining synovial membrane, the articu- lar cavity is generally found to contain a sero-mucoid or a sero-fibrinous exudation in which there are no bacteria. There is often associated with the disease, at the same time, an acute endocarditis—evidently of infectious origin. Those cases which are believed to be instances of acute febrile articular rheumatism which end fatally, and in which a purulent exudation containing pyogenic micro-organisms is found in the

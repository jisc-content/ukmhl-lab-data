ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 176 adults.* In most instances the subchronic or chronic solitary tubercles owe their origin in the brain to a metastatic process; they rarely develop primarily in that organ. Among the tumor-like affections of the brain the solitary tubercle occupies the most im- portant place. The first beginnings of a tubercle are to be found in those vascular processes of the pia which extend into the peripheral portions of the brain. The nod- ules and nodes which originate in this way grow slowly, are usually of a rounded form, and may attain the size of a cherry, or an English walnut, or even a larger size. The nodule is mainly of a yellow color, cheesy in its composition, fairly tough as regards its consistence, but sometimes also soft, as when it is breaking down into pus. The marginal zone is of a grayish-red color or of a transparent gray, and full of miliary nodules which become blended with the larger parent nodule. The latter may therefore be considered as a conglomeration of what were origi- nally much smaller nodules. The brain substance in the neighborhood of the solitary tubercles is often in a condition of red or white softening, as shown by the presence of capillary apoplexies in these parts. The solitary tubercles are most frequently located in the gray substance, particularly in that of the cerebellum, and also in the cerebral cortex, in the pons, and in the ganglia of the caudex cerebri. In from twenty to twenty-five per cent of all cases tuberculous granulo- * Among one hundred and fifty cases of fatal tuberculosis in children (under fifteen years of age) the soft membranes were involved forty times, whereas the brain itself was affected only twelve times.

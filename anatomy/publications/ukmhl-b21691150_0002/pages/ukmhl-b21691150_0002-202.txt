84 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Carcinoma of the urinary bladder is rarely seen as a primary growth, but it is often encountered as a tumor of secondary development. In the latter case the primary seat of the malignant growth is in wo- men either in the body of the uterus, in its cervix, or in the vagina, while in men it is generally in the rec- tum. Primary carcinoma of the bladder has either a villous or a papillary structure (villous cancer), or that of a fungous growth, or else it presents the char- acteristics of an infiltration of the bladder-wall. In some instances it develops secondarily to stone in the bladder. Hsematuria and catarrh are symptoms which often accompany new growths of the bladder. Foreign Bodies and Calculi in the Urinary Bladder. Foreign bodies find their way into the bladder from neighboring organs; as, for example, by the breaking through of a dermoid cyst (hairs, bones, etc.) or of an extra-uterine foetal sac. Here belong also those calculi which have come down from the pelvis of the kidney. Stone in the bladder is a condition which develops chiefly in advanced life and almost exclusively in individuals of the male sex. Calculi found in the urinary bladder are of two kinds: those which come from the pelvis of the kid- ney and consequently are of renal origin, and those which develop primarily in the bladder. The calculi of renal origin are apt to give rise to aome form of in- flammation, and, as a result of this, decomposition of the urine takes place, insufficiency of the bladder is

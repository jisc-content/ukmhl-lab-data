ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 74 gray or a dark brownish-yellow color—the so-called “mulberry calculi.” 3. Calculi composed of the phosphates and carbonates. They are of a whitish color, resemble chalk, and are easily friable. They usually develop in the course of inflammations of the pelvis of the kidney, when the urine undergoes certain chemical changes and alka- line fermentation takes place. Through the decom- position of the urea carbonate of ammonium is formed, and uric acid combines with ammonium to form the urate of ammonium. Then, again, by a combination of the latter with the phosphate of magnesium the triple phosphate is formed. 4. Calculi composed of cystin are soft and of the color of yellow wax. When broken they show a crystalline fracture. It is a common event to find calcidi composed of laminae of different materials. Thus, for example, the inner layers may be composed of uric acid and the urates, while the outer ones are formed of the oxa- lates and triple phosphates. The calculi which are formed in the pelvis of the kidney may ofteu, as is the case with gall stones, give rise to no symptoms whatever; or they may, ac- cording to their size and the character of their sur- face, produce a variety of results. Thus, for exam- ple, they usually lead to dilatation of the pelvis of the kidney, and when they are of large size they are apt to produce atrophy of the organ itself. Hasma- turia and pyuria (pyonephrosis calculosa) may be expected when the calculi irritate the surface of the pelvic mucous membrane. Then, again, a purulent pyelitis may—following an ascending course—lead to

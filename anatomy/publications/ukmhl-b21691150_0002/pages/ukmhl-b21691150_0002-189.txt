Car- cinoma of the kidney is a much rarer tumor. It varies in size from that of a fist to that of a man’s head. The surface of a section presents a whitish or a red- dish color, and often shows the tissues to be inter- spersed with cavernous spaces and accumulations of blood (fungus hsematodes). In addition to these regular types, now and then mixed forms of tumors are found in the kidney. Multiple carcinomatous and sarcomatous nodules, representing secondary and metastatic forms of tu- mors, are often found in the kidney. Abnormal Position op the Kidneys. This pathological condition is either of congenital origin or the result of forces operating later in life. Generally only one kidney is affected, and in this case it will be found lying at the upper margin of the pelvis, on the promontory. The point of origin of the renal vessels will also be found to be correspond- ingly altered. When the two kidneys are fused into one (the malformation known as the horse-shoe kid- ney, or cake-shaped kidney), the organ may be found lying in Douglas’ sac or space, and in women, when this is the case, its presence in this situation may prove an obstacle to the birth of a child. When the kidney is abnormally mobile, it is cus- tomary to apply to it the term wandering kidney (ren mobilis). The right kidney is the one usually affected

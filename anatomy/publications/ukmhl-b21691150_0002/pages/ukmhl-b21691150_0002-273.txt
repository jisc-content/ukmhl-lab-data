155 NERVOUS APPARATUS. Inflammation of the Soft Membranes of the Brain and Spinal Cord â€” Leptomeningitis; Arachnitis. The commonest form is that which is known as chronic fibrous meningitis. It is characterized by a milky clouding of the soft membranes and by the de- velopment of an unusually large number of Pacchi- onian bodies or granulations. As a rule the disease develops slowly, either as a consequence of frequently repeated-congestive hypersemias, or as the sequel to some preceding inflammatory process, or again as a secondary result of any one of a variety of brain dis- eases (e.g., atrophy). Acute Purulent Meningitis. This disease is encountered in two principal forms: 1, as a diffuse inflammation extending over the con- vex and basal portions of the brain {convexity menin- gitis) ; and 2, as a purulent basilar meningitis, asso- ciated, as a rule, with purulent inflammation of the membranes of the spinal cord (epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis). 1. Diffuse convexity meningitis. This form of the disease develops in connection with injuries of the skull or as a result of disease in the neighborhood (such as caries of the petrous portion of the temporal bone). It may also owe its origin to disease located in the nasal cavities or in the frontal sinuses, or to disease (abscess) of the brain; and, finally, it may develop through metastatic processes (by way of the

NERVOUS APPARATUS. 161 â€”should be classified as genuine cases of dropsy, in- asmuch as they owe their origin to disturbances of the circulation (beginning either in the heart or in the lungs) and particularly to chronic stasis in the venous circulation. The pathological alterations ob- served are the following: After the removal of the dura, it will be seen that the subarachnoid spaces are well filled with a serous fluid, and that the ventricles of the brain, which are more or less dilated, also con- tain more than the normal quantity of serum. The soft membranes are generally somewhat thickened, and they show a milky opacity. Chronic hydro- cephalus internus (without hydrocephalus externus) often develops in connection with such tumors of the brain (more particularly of the cerebellum) as are located in the vicinity of the cerebral fissure or of the walls of the ventricles. A special form of chronic hydrocephalus internus et externus develops, as a secondary disease, in con- nection with atrophy of the brain; this is the form known as hydrops ex vacuo. One can readily under- stand that any diminution in the volume of the brain must necessarily, as a result of the unyielding char- acter of the bony skull, be compensated for by an increase in the quantity of the cerebro-spinal fluid. Cases of this character are observed in connection with senile and presenile (particularly arterio-scle- rotic) atrophy of the brain. On the other hand, the majority of cases of hydro- cephalus internus in children (hydrocephalus congen- itus et acquisitus), as well as the hydrocephalus which is associated with basilar meningitis, belong in the category of serous inflammations.

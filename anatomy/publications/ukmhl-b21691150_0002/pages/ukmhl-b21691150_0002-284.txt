166 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. matic apoplexy is often associated with a meningeal hemorrhage upon the surface of the brain, and the location of these two lesions usually corresponds either with the spot at which the trauma first took effect, or with one situated directly opposite to it (contrecoup). The course and terminations of a trau- matic apoplexy are generally the same as those of the spontaneous variety. In the newborn child traumatic hemorrhages of the cerebral membranes and of the brain itself are particularly liable to occur when the obstacles to the delivery of the child are of such a nature as to require instrumental interference. 4. As the result, more particularly, of degenerative disease of the arteries, in combination with hyper- trophy of the heart. Such spontaneous apoplexies in the substance of the brain occur chiefly at an ad- vanced period of life; seventy-one per cent occurring beyond the age of fifty, seventeen per cent between forty and fifty, and only eight per cent between thirty and forty. The spontaneous form of cerebral apoplexy (Plate 32) occurs most often in the region of the caudex cerebri (the corpus striatum, the thalamus opticus, and the nucleus caudatus), which receives its supply of blood from a branch of the arteria pro fossa Sylvii (arteria lenticulo-striata). The hemorrhagic foci vary in size, the majority of them being as large as a plum or even as a gooseâ€™s egg. Very often the blood breaks through into the ventricles, which, under these cir- cumstances, will be found filled with bloody serum and masses of blackish-brown clotted blood. In ad- dition to the accumulated blood there will be found, in these apoplexies, remnants of broken-down brain

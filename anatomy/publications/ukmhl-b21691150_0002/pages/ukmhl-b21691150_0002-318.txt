ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 200 extent of about eighteen per cent. This diminution appears to be greater in the spongy than in the com- pact substance of the bone—a difference which favors the idea that the pathological process advances from the medulla toward the periphery and in the direc- tion of the epiphyses. In quite recent times the belief has found favor that osteomalacia is a trophoneurosis of the bones, which has for its starting-point the ovaries. Such a belief makes it easier for us to understand the connec- tion between the process in question and ovulation, pregnancy, and the lying-in period. Of special in- terest, therefore, is the fact that the operative removal of the ovaries has effected a large number of cures (eighty per cent) of osteomalacia, whereas formerly the mortality of the disease amounted to precisely this figure, viz., eighty per cent. Acute Osteomyelitis. This disease begins, as a rule, in the neighborhood of the epiphyses of the long bones, but it does also develop, in a few cases, near the spot at which an in- jury, a fracture or a shot wound, has occurred at some earlier date. The disease is confined almost entirely to youthful individuals who have not yet ceased to grow. So far as its essential nature is con- cerned, it is a disease due to infection—a hsematoge- nous and cryptogenous infection by staphylococci. In rare cases it may be produced by other micro-para- sites (streptococci, typhoid baciili, pneumococci). It is not known exactly how these carriers of infection find their way into the body. Now and then the osteo-

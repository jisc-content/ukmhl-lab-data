Explanation of Plate 48. Myelogenous Hemorrhagic Sarcoma of the Humerus, with Central Softening. The upper third of the bone (right humerus) is the seat of a tumor larger than one’s fist, of a dark brown color, and of rather soft consistence. When pressed upon it gives forth a crepitating, grating sort of a sound, which is due to the presence of some fragments and thin scales of bone in the shell-like walls of the tumor. In the centre of the growth, in the place of the bone which has become disintegrated, there is a cavity, larger than a goose’s egg, which is filled with blood and blood-tinged remains of tissue. The head of the humerus is in a ne- crosed state in its interior, while its convex articular surface, to a depth of a few millimetres, is still intact and may easily be bent when pressed upon. That por- tion of the shaft of the bone (middle third of the hu- merus) which borders upon the tumor is fissured and somewhat disintegrated. The picture presented under the microscope is that of a very vascular myxo-sarcoma. Tumors of a similar nature were found on the left hu- merus, on the left femur, and on one rib. The patient upon whom the above-described tumor was found was a man fifty-three years old (Journal, No. 383, 1897), who stated that he had been ill only two months. At first, he had suffered from severe pains in the upper epiphyses of the three tubular bones mentioned above. Then, in the course of a few days, tumor-like swellings had made their appearance. The skin, at the affected spots, was found to have a dark-red color, and distinct fluctuation was felt. When the parts were in- cised apparently nothing but blood escaped. Central hemorrhagic bone sarcomata, such as we are now consid- ering, were formerly termed hsematomata of bone (Volk- mann) or bone-aneurisms.* * A more detailed description of the present case will be found in the dissertation of Emil Walther: “Zwei F&lle von rnyelo- genem Osteo-Sarcom. ” Munich, 1888.

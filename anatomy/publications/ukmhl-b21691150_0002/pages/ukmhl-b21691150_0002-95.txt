Explanation of Plate 27. Chronic Congenital Hydrocephalus. The case under consideration is that of a female child, fourteen months old. At the post-mortem examination the head looked as if it had been blown up like a bal- loon. The cerebral part of the skull was very much larger than the facial part. The frontal and parietal prominences stood out conspicuously. All the sutures and fontanelles gaped, widely open. The large fontanelle measured 12 cm. in length, and 5 cm. in breadth. The circumference of the skull measured 55 cm. There were extensive defects in the vault of the cranium. After the latter had been removed, aud the enormously distended ventricles had been emptied of their contents (about 1,400 c.c. of fluid as clear as water), the cerebral hemi- spheres presented the appearance of two collapsed blad- ders. This shell of cerebral substance measured only 10 or 11 mm. in thickness. (The condition may properly be termed secondary pressure atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres.) The other pathological conditions found in this greatly emaciated child (which weighed only 6.5 kgm.) were the following: Tuberculosis of the peribronchial and medi- astinal lymph glands; confluent lobular pneumonia on the right side; fatty liver; and rhachitis.

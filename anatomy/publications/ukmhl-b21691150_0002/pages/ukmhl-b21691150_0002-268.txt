150 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. clition the term hcematoma of the dura mater is com- monly applied. Through the retrograde changes which take place in the red blood corpuscles and the coloring matter of this escaped blood the organized membrane soon assumes a rusty hue; and by aid of the microscope it will be found that this is due to the presence of free granular and crystalline pigment (hsematoidin). The feature which is the most char- acteristic of this proliferative (and also somewhat hemorrhagic) inflammation is the rapid and at the same time prolific development of blood-vessels; and by reason of the imperfect organization of these ves- sels, which are evidently subjected to unfavorable con- ditions (e.g., inadequate provision for the return flow of blood), repeated hemorrhages are likely to occur. Hemorrhagic and vascular pachymeningitis is often found accidentally (i.e., not having been suspected during the patient’s lifetime), at the post-mortem ex- amination, to have been the immediate cause of death. Then, besides, it is encountered under the following circumstances: in persons—men more frequently than women, and especially those who have reached middle life or old age—who are suffering from some form of psychosis, from progressive paralysis, or from atrophy of the brain; in cachectic individuals; and especially often in those addicted to the excessive use of alcohol. The diminution in volume of the brain as a whole (from atrophy and anaemia) induces compensatory hypersemia of the dura mater (through diminution of the intracranial pressure), and thus plainly, in many cases, favors the development of this peculiar inflammation of the dura mater, which in the main is only scantily supplied with blood-vessels.

90 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. the disease atrophy of the parenchyma takes place, and azoospermia is established. The entire organ undergoes diminution in size, it lacks firmness of consistence, and it presents a pale color. Through- out the parenchyma whitish bands of newly formed connective tissue may be seen. There is usually as- sociated with this sort of inflammation an adhesive peri-orchitis. Chronic interstitial orchitis, that ter- minates in atrophy of the testicle, is often of syphi- litic origin. Tuberculosis of the Testicle. (Plate 15.) As a primary disease tuberculosis of the testicle occurs very rarely. As a rule it develops secondarily in this organ and is of metastatic (haematogenous) origin. Now and then the tuberculous process spreads (as in genito-urinary tuberculosis), in a downward direction from the kidneys to the bladder, urethra, seminal vesicles, spermatic cord, and testicles; but it is a more common occurrence for the tuberculosis to take an ascending course from the epididymis and testicle to the vas deferens, the prostate, etc. As ex- citing causes for an outbreak of tuberculosis of the testicle may be mentioned physical injuries, increased sexual activity (soon after marriage), and gonorrhoeal infection (from eighteen to twenty-seven per cent). The process generally begins in the tail-like end of the epididymis, and gradually there are developed a number of yellowish nodules, of varying size, which show a tendency to soften (cheesy and purulent soft- ening) and to break outwardly.

NERVOUS APPARATUS. 157 in death, recovery being a very rare event—a specific microparasite has been discovered, viz., the meningo- coccus intracellularis. (Plate 28.) Tuberculous Basilar Meningitis. In a comparatively small number of instances a tuberculous inflammation of the soft membranes of the brain develops, as a secondary process, from older solitary tubercles of the brain itself, or from a tuber- culous otitis media, or from a tuberculous caries of the spine. In the great majority of cases, however, the tubercle bacilli are transported along the blood chan- nels from some older tuberculous deposit—already cheesy and in necrotic condition—which is situated in another part of the body; and these bacilli almost invariably become lodged at the base of the brain, and more particularly above the chiasma and the pons and in that vicinity, from which region the tuberculous disease spreads laterally into the fossae Sylvii, as far as to the island of Beil. The older tuberculous deposits, from which this infection of the brain proceeds, may be located in the apices of the lungs, in the lymph glands, in bony structures, in the joints, in the kidneys, or in the testicles. It is only in rare instances that the bacilli are transported to the convex portion of the brain (two per cent) or to the membranes of the spinal cord (two per cent). When death has occurred during the early stages of the disease a scanty, sero-gelatinous, pale yellow or grayish exudation will be found, at the post-mortem examination, in the interstices of the loose tissues composing the soft membranes of the brain, and es- pecially along the course of the blood-vessels.

The larger and medium-sized arteries are generally in a sclerosed condition. The presenile form of diffuse brain atrophy, which occurs in men between the ages of forty-five and sixty, presents very much the same anatomical changes as does the senile form; a highly developed atheroma- tosis, especially of the basilar arteries, being demon- strable in most cases as the chief cause of the disease. The brain, like the heart, is much more capable of withstanding the effects of inanition, of chronic anrn- mia, than are the other organs of the body. Diffuse atrophy of the brain is also observed in cases of chronic hydrocephalus (Plate 26) and of paralysis. In the latter condition the cerebrum often loses more than one-quarter of its weight, while the cerebellum remains almost unchanged. In a large proportion of the cases the underlying cause is a postsyphilitic process, associated with atrophy of the nerve fibres and cells of the cerebral cortex; and, as secondary results of these changes, we have nar- rowing of the cortex and diffuse atrophy of the brain. Local atrophy, in the form of separate foci or areas, is generally the result of pressure, such as may be exerted by tumors of the brain, by infectious granulo- mata, by exostoses, and by parasites. Defective development of the brain (hypoplasia), or microcephalia, which is due to some arrest in the general development, affects the organ either uni- formly, as a whole, or else only in certain of its parts â€”as, for example, the corpus callosum, the cerebel- lum, or a single hemisphere.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 66 Healing of tuberculous disease of the kidneys, with the eventual formation of cicatricial tissue, cysts, or chalky masses, is a termination which can scarcely be expected. These destructive processes in the kidneys are very often accompanied by simultaneous disease of the genital organs—genito-urinary tuberculosis. Degenerative and Betrogressive Processes in the Kidneys. Among the changes of this nature in the kidneys the commonest is fatty degeneration (“fatty kidney”), which may either develop rapidly and run a brief course (as, for example, in some cases of poisoning [phosphorus] and in certain infectious diseases), or may develop somewhat slowly as the final stage, or as an accompanying phenomenon, in a variety of inflam- matory processes, such as subacute and subchronic parenchymatous nephritis. It is also observed as an accompaniment of the amyloid kidney. (Plate 9, Pig. a.) The fatty change takes place first in the epithelial cells of the urinary canaliculi, and it either affects them symmetrically and diffusely throughout the en- tire organ (as in the case of the fatty kidney caused by phosphorus poisoning), or else it is confined to certain spots or larger areas. When the organ is diffusely affected the enlarged kidney presents a uni- formly pale or a somewhat whitish-yellow color; it also contains very little blood, but rather an abun- dance of juices. Finally, the region of the cortex is much broader than normal, and the striations are

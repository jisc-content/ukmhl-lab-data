The larger part of the bony structures of the jaw had been supplanted by tumor tissues. The patient, a man about thirty-three years of age, stated that the tumor had been growing during a period of four years, and that the first evidences of its existence were discovered on the gum surrounding the left lower wisdom tooth. (For a more detailed description of this case consult the dissertation of Alfred Sternfeld: “Ueber Exarticulation des Unterkiefers zur Entfernung von Tumoren.” Munich, 1880. Fig. 12.-Central (enosteal) Fibroma of the Left Lower Jaw. (From a boy, ten years old.) Upon the outer surface of the growth there are several parallel ridges of bone which run in an up-and-down direction, and between them the grayish-white tissue of the growth protrudes. The spicules of bone appear to grow out from the jaw. The inner medial sur- face of the tumor is quite flat and shows no traces whatever of bone formation. The tumor grew from the connective tissue of the bone, and not from the periosteum. Its advancing growth not only caused the bone of the jaw to be absorbed but it also excited inflammatory action on the part of the periosteum. It was through the latter inflammation that the shell-

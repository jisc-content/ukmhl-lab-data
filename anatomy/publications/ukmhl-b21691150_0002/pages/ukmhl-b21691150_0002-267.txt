149 NERVOUS APPARATUS. Pachymeningitis Interna Hemorrhagica. (Plate 31.) The commonest form of inflammation of the dura mater is that which is known as 'pachymeningitis in- terna hcemorrhagica or vasculosa. At the commence- ment of the disease the internal surface of the dura, especially over the cerebral hemispheres, will be found covered with a delicate, veil-like coating of a bright red or a dark red color, and easily removable from the membrane. This pseudo-membrane, which is composed partly of fibrin and partly of newly formed and quickly vascularized connective tissue, increases in thickness, sometimes quite fast, at other times more slowly; and in it may be seen, either with the unaided e}re or by means of the microscope, both diffuse and punctate extravasations of blood. When the disease lasts for a sufficient length of time this highly vascular deposit or pseudo-membrane assumes a tougher consistence and adheres more firmly to the dura mater. When frequently repeated hemorrhages (by diapedesis) take place into the delicate inflamma- tory membrane, and particularly into those layers of it which lie immediately next to the dura, there will be formed—in the later stages of the disease, and es- pecially when it lasts for a considerable time—a ver- itable sac of blood. This mass of blood spreads out over the surface of the brain; the only thing which limits its advance being the primary inflammatory pseudo-membrane. Ultimately it may attain a thick- ness of several centimetres and an extent equal to that of a large saucer, or even larger. To this con-

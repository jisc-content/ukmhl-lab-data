97 SEXUAL ARPARATU8. DISEASES OF THE FEMALE SEXUAL ORGANS. OVARIES. Defective development (hypoplasia) of these glands is observed as an accompaniment of rudimentary de- velopment of the uterus, the Graafian follicles being either entirely absent or else present in scanty num- ber. This arrest of development is often associated with imperfect development of the entire body, as well as with other conditions, such as anaemia, chlo- rosis, abnormal smallness of the heart, and narrow- ness of the calibre and thinness of the walls of the aorta and larger arterial trunks. Dislocation of the ovaries is often caused by the traction exerted by peritoneal adhesions (the result of adhesive and obliterating pelveo-peritonitis and peri-oophoritis). Under these circumstances the ovaries are often completely embedded in such orga- nized products of inflammation, and it is sometimes a difficult matter to discover where these organs are located, this being particularly the case when second- ary atrophy has already taken place in them. Fix- ation of the Fallopian tubes in some abnormal posi- tion, obliteration of the abdominal orifices of these tubes, hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx are among the common accompaniments of the condition described above. Disturbances of the circulation (congestion, venous hypersemia) owe their origin to the same causes which produce these conditions in other glandular organs. In addition to the physiological bleeding

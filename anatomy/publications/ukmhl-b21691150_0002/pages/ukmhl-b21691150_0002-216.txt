ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 98 which takes place when a follicle ruptures and a cor- pus luteum is formed, hemorrhages occur with com- parative frequency in the cystic new growths of the ovary (formation of hemorrhagic cysts). Inflammation of the Ovary; Oophoritis. This is a rare process; it occurs more often as a secondary phenomenon than as an idiopathic mani- festation. In the acute forms of the inflammation—which may generally be divided into a follicular and an intersti- tial variety—the ovaries are swollen and highly cedem- atous. Scattered centres of suppuration (abscesses) are not often formed. An acute infectious oophoritis occurs most frequently in connection with septic and purulent inflammations of the endometrium, Fallo- pian tubes, and pelvic peritoneum. In the latter case, if the patient recovers, adhesions will be found to have taken place between the ovaries and the neigh- boring organs, and ultimately the "former will undergo atrophy. Chronic interstitial oophoritis (terminating in granu- lar atrophy) is often observed as a result of debilitat- ing constitutional diseases. It also develops as a result of unknown causes. Both ovaries are regu- larly affected by the disease. At first the inflamma- tory process, which is hyperplastic in character, attacks the corten and gradually advances from here to the centre. In its progress the follicles are de- stroyed (through wasting) and consequently the func- tional activity of the gland ceases (in other words, sterility is established). Ultimately the ovaries will

Explanation of Plate 31. Pachymeningitis Intekna Hemorrhagica. Pachy- meningitis Vasculosa Chronica. (Two-thirds natural size.) The inner surface of the dura mater (right half) is -covered with a pseudo-membrane which is colored a pale red in some parts, a dark red in others, and which clings firmly to the dura. On the left side there is presented an irregularly-shaped yellowish-green deposit which rests upon an older layer of organized exuded material of a dark red color and infiltrated ivith blood. The ex- planation of these conditions is this: An infectious fibrino-purulent inflammation has, in this case, been grafted upon an older proliferative process, a complica- tion which is observed only in rare instances. The pseudo-membrane, which is applied quite uniformly over the inner surface of the dura mater, is composed of a fibrous connective tissue which in some parts is rich in cells and everywhere is liberally supplied with blood- vessels (pachymeningitis vasculosa). In many places throughout the layers of newly formed tissue there may be seen hemorrhagic exudations of older and more recent dates. It is safe to assume that these hemorrhages have come from the imperfectly developed new blood-vessels, through a process of diapedesis.

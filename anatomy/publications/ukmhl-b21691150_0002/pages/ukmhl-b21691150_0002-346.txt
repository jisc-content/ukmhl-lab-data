In rare in- stances this first stage is immediately followed by a retrogression of all the symptoms and a cure. In the great majority of cases, however, organization and vascularization of the deeper layers of the fibrinous pseudo-membrane soon take place. And while this is going on, new layers of fibrin are constantly being deposited on the surface which is turned toward the cavity of the joint—a process which is accompanied by the exudation, into the latter, of either a clear fluid or one that is filled with flocculent material. At the same time numerous tuberculous nodules develop in the organized pseudo-membrane, and these nodules show a decided tendency to fuse together and to break down into cheesy material. Spongy granulations clothe more or less completely the internal surface of the joint cavity. These are essentially the product of a superficial infectious process. With the advance of the inflammation, not only the articular cartilage but also the adjacent bone structures break down and be- come converted into fluid. The granulation tissue, which extends also over the cartilaginous surface, wears the latter away and destroys it. Then, when the latter has been destroyed, the process extends to the bone and establishes there the same destructive changes as are observed in primary tuberculous os- teitis. In the cavity of the joint, at this stage, there is usually found a tliinnish fluid, that looks like pus. On examination, however, it is found to contain only a few pus corpuscles, numerous products of disin- tegration, detritus, and a few tubercle bacilli. In favorable cases the granulation growths shrink

Explanation of Plate 12. 11, 1895.) Chronic Tuberculous Pyelo-Nephritis. The kidney is very much enlarged, in some instances to nearly three times its normal size. Weight, in this particular case, 370 gm. (the normal weight, as the pa- tient was very much emaciated, would be about 130 gm.). When the organ was cut open a thin, purulent, grayish-yellow fluid escaped from the dilated pelvis. The outer surface of the kidney is somewhat uneven through the presence of a number of low hummocks. The parenchyma, which is pale and saturated with moisture, presents everywhere throughout its substance irregularly shaped, and in some spots confluent, nodules and larger deposits of cheesy material. The pelvis is dilated in an irregular manner, there being at some points cavern-like diverticula which extend far into the pyramidal substance. Indeed, at one spot, the divertic- ulum—owing to the breaking down of the parenchyma —has pushed its way up to the very capsule of the kid- ney. The pale-yellow walls of these diverticula, which are filled with cheesy nodules, are at all points sharply separated from the neighboring tissues. To the left and somewhat below the middle line, in the picture, it will be seen how this cheesy infiltration of the pelvic mucous membrane extends down into the ureter itself. As a matter of fact, the tuberculous disease of the right kidney and the right ureter had extended so far as to involve the neck of the urinary bladder, the prostate, the seminal vesicles, one of the seminiferous canaliculi, and the cor- responding testicle (genito-urinary tuberculosis; compare Plate 15). The patient from whom this specimen was taken, and who was twenty-five years of age, died from an acute terminal basilar meningitis of a tuberculous nature, and was also affected at the same time with chronic tuber- culous disease of the larynx, lungs, and intestines.

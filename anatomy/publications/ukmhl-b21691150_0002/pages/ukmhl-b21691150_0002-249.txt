SEXUAL APPARATUS. 131 myomatous polypi); but they are distinguishable from these by their firmer consistence and by the absence of cysts. They more or less completely fill the cavity of the uterus. Not infrequently dilated cyst-like cavities are disseminated through the sub- stance of the myoma (myoma cavernosum cysticum). These owe their origin to the breaking down and liquefaction of the tissues at the corresponding spots (cysts due to processes of softening), or else they are formed from dilated lymph vessels and spaces in the tissues, and consequently represent genuine endo- thelium-lined lymph cysts. In these tumors there is a decided tendency (one-third of all cases) toward retrogressive changes—fatty degeneration, shrinking, and calcification, especially after the climacteric pe- riod has been passed. Interstitial calcified myomata (uterine calculi) may eventually lie free in the cavity of the uterus and be ejected during the patient’s life- time. Then, besides, a decided tendency to hemor- rhages, inflammation, necrosis, and suppuration has been observed in these tumors, more particularly in the submucous myomata. The adeno-myomala (of Yon Recklinghausen) con- stitute a special group. They contain tubular gland structures, which come originally from the organ of Wolff; and often cysts, lined with cylindrical epithe- lium, are found in them (cystadenomata). It is only in rare cases that myoma and carcinoma of the uterus occur together in the same case. During the development of the myoma the uterus often undergoes at the same time a marked degree of hypertrophy, the cavity of the organ becoming di- lated, and its walls—especially in the submucous

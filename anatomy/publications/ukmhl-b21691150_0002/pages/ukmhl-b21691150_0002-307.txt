THE BONES AND JOINTS. 189 The internal atrophy of bone (osteoporosis) is asso- ciated with rarefaction of the bone tissue, and is often the result of rarefying osteitis. Senile or physiological atrophy of bone (osteoporo- sis) is characterized by rarefaction of the bone tissue, by a partial disappearance of the spongy portion, by a conversion of the compact substance into bone of a spongy character, by dilatation of the medullary spaces and bone canals, and by an increased fragility of the bone-tissue in general. Furthermore, the bone marrow as a rule presents a jelly-like consistence. An analogous condition of osteoporosis often develops as a result of those chronic diseases which induce a general cachexia—such, for example, as cancer and the severe forms of syphilis. Very similar are the conditions which characterize that form of bone atrophy which results from lack of use (inactivity atrophy), and which is observed in connection with paralyses of various kinds—as, for example, in severe functional disturbances of the joints, and in tabes (in which also it is the paralysis that is the important factor). Such atrophied bones weigh much less than they normally should, and they show diminished powers of resistance and a special tendency to become fractured. Local atrophy of the bone, due to pressure or wear- ing away of its substance, occurs, for example, in connection with a neighboring aneurism or new growth.

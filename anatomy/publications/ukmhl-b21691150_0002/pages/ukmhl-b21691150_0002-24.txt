Explanation of Plate 4. Chronic Interstitial Nephritis: Inflammatory, in Part Slightly Granular and in Part Smooth, Contracted Kidney. The right kidney is distinctly diminished in size and its capsule is hard to remove. In fact, small bits of cor- tex tissue are commonly found adhering to the inner sur- face of the fibrous capsule. The organ presents a pale coloring aud in some places it is a little spotted. The surface at some points is finely granular, while at others it is smooth but depressed, as if drawn in. The sub- stance of the kidney is tough and cuts like India rubber. The line of demarcation between the cortex and the medullary substance is plainly marked. The cortical zone is reduced in breadth, but not to the same degree at all points; it is noticeably paler than are the darker and somewhat shortened pyramids. Weight = 120 gm. The left kidney, which weighed only 65 gm., showed alter- ations similar to those described above but of a more pronounced character. In this patient (a hostler, twenty-seven years of age) various other pathological changes were found, as, for example: Marked hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart (weight = 620 gm.), particularly of the left ven- tricle; a terminal, acute, sero-fibrinous pericarditis; hemorrhagic infarction of the lower lobe of the right lung; anasarca of the scrotum and lower extremities; general anaemia. Duration of illness about three-quarters of a year. Swelling of the feet, general weakness, a sense of oppres- sion in the chestâ€”these were the leading symptoms ob- served by the patient, who confessed to the habit of drinking beer to excess. Urine very clear; specific gravity, 1.008; 4.5 per cent of albumin present. Under the microscope numerous leucocytes, kidney epithelial cells, granular casts, and triple phosphates were seen. There was also retinitis albuminurica, and toward the last the amount of albumin in the urine increased to seven per cent. (No. 136, 1894.)

Explanation of Plate 47. Tuberculous Bone Abscess in the Lower Portion of the Humerus. (From a Child.) The tuberculous caries has, in this case, led to the for- mation of an abscess cavity, which is situated in the sub- stance of the very much expanded and thickened lower portion of the humerus. This abscess has broken through to the surface, and, after partially destroying the epiphysis, has involved the elbow-joint. The thickening of the surrounding bone substance is due partly to hyper- plastic osteitis and partly to periostitis.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 96 the urethra. These are compensatory hypertrophy of the muscular walls of the bladder, dilatation of the ureters, hydronephrosis, and occasionally also a septic pyelo-nephritis, the issue of which is death. Atrophy of the prostate is encountered in persons suffering from marasmus and in castrated individ- uals. It is also a fact, established by the results of recent operations, that a pathologically enlarged pros- tate—especially the softer variety—rapidly under- goes atrophy and diminution in size after castration. Experiences like these warrant the inference that the prostate, as an accessory sexual gland, is entirely dependent upon the integrity of the testicles, not only for its continuing existence but also for its develop- ment. When the nervous influence which binds these two glands together in close functional relationship is withdrawn, atrophy of the prostate begins. Resec- tion of the seminal ducts acts upon the prostate in very much the same manner as does castration, but .yet the effect is not so certain. Concretions and calculi are often encountered in the prostate. The so-called concretions (which assume a bluish-violet color when treated with iodine, or a red- dish hue, like the amyloid substances, when treated with methyl violet) are found quite regularly in the prostate of sexually mature men. They probably owe their formation to the coagulation of albuminous secretion or of cast-off cells. The calculi, which are usually present in considerable numbers, display a brownish or a yellowish color.

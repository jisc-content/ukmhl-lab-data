Explanation of Plate 41. Pelvis Affected with Osteomalacia. The lateral pressure exerted by the thigh bones has caused the symphysis to protrude forward like a beak, and has materially diminished the transverse diameter of the pelvis. The rami of the os pubis are curved to an unusual degree. Owing to the pressure exerted by the trunk, the os sacrum is pushed down to an abnormally low level. The internal surfaces of the ilia are also ab- normally curved and lengthened laterally. The outlines of the upper entrance to the pelvis are like those of the figure of a heart in playing-cards. The entire pelvis weighs less than it normally should, and in the fresh state it yields as if made of India rub- ber; it is also easy to cut.

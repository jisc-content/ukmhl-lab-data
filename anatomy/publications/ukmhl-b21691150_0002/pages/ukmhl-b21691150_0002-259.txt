141 SEXUAL APPARATUS. Inflammation of the Mammary Gland; Mastitis. Except during the lying-in period inflammation of the mammaiy gland is very rarely seen, and then almost always as a result of some injury. It runs a mild course, and terminates either in resolution or in the formation of an abscess. When an abscess of this kind is deeply seated, it may easily be mistaken for a tumor. By far the commonest form of inflammation is that which occurs during the lying-in periodâ€”puerperal mastitis, which usually is of infectious origin. About six per cent of all nursing mothers suffer from the disease, which develops as a rule during the month immediately following the birth of the child. In a smaller number of cases the inflammation (under the influence of an infection by streptococci) confines itself to the surface and takes on an erysi- pelatous character. It starts from a fissure or other lesion of the nipple, and runs a course not unlike that of an erysipelas migrans or a phlegmon, the paren- chyma of the gland participating in only a subordi- nate manner in the disease. Precisely as takes place in infection of a wound, the pathogenic germs gain an entrance from the erosions which so commonly are present in the nipple, and work their way into the lactiferous ducts. The coagulation and subsequent decomposition of the secretion of the gland are favor- ing factors, the action of these solidified matters being that of foreign bodies. The most common form of inflammation is the circumscribed parenchymatous and interstitial mastitis.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 198 exercise, is most clearly shown by the fact that during the winter months the disease progressively increases in frequency, reaching its maximum in the spring and early summer, and its minimum in November and December. The so-called foetal rachitis (chondrodystrophia fcetalis) has, in the majority of cases, no relationship whatever to true rachitis; it is, in fact, a peculiar and variable anomaly in the development of the car- tilaginous structures. Osteomalacia. (Plate 41.) Osteomalacia occurs only in adults; it is a disease of fully developed bone. The Haversian canals and the medullary spaces are surrounded by a broad ring of tissue containing no lime. Through the melting down of tissue adjoining lacunae coalesce and fissures form between the fibrillse. Atrophy of the bone tis- sue goes hand-in-hand with the gradual disappearance of its calcareous elements, and with this loss absorp- tion of the bone cartilage is also associated. The newly formed fissures and canals become filled with lymph or marrow fat; they become medullary spaces, and it is to their presence that bone affected with osteomalacia owes its porosity. This process is con- fined largely to individuals of the female sex. It often begins during one period of pregnancy, and then be- comes aggravated during each succeeding period. The entire skeleton grows smaller. By reason of their rubber-like softness the individual bones become curved and bent in a variety of ways. The order in

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 154 tends into the communicating veinlets which belong to the pia mater covering the convexity of the cere- bral hemispheres. This dangerous affection of the veins, associated as it is with closure of the lumen of the vessel, occurs most often in cachectic and anaemic individuals whose heart power is enfeebled. Certain anomalies of the blood (more particularly chlorosis) predispose decidedly to such thrombosis; and so, too, do certain chronic conditions of inanition which are observed in childhood. Among the results which follow the process de- scribed above, especially when the sinus rectus and the vena magna of Galen are implicated at the same time, acute phenomena of stasis in the areas belong- ing to these veins deserve special mention. Such are, for example, well-marked venous hypersemia, oedema due to stasis in the venous circulation, multi- ple hemorrhages, red softening, particularly in the neighborhood of the walls of the ventricles, and acute hydrocephalus internus. It is an easy matter at the post-mortem table to mistake such apoplexies, due to stasis, for an acute multiple hemorrhagic encepha- litis ; and this is particularly likely to happen if the primary thrombosis escape attention. Septic thrombo-phlebitis (primary phlebitis and sec- ondary thrombosis) takes place most commonly in the transverse sinus, and often extends from this point, in a centripetal direction, on into the jugular vein. As a secondary result embolic abscesses may form in the lungs (general septico-pysemia), or a purulent lepto- meningitis may be developed (in more than one-third of the cases). It is only in exceptional cases that recov- ery takes place (either with or without an operation).

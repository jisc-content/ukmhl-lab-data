THE BONES AND JOINTS. 191 ing to the direction in which the line of the break runs. When small fragments are separated from the main body of the bone at the point where the break has occurred, it is customary to employ the term splintered fracture. A direct fracture is one in which the break occurs at the point to which the force was directly applied. In an indirect fracture, on the other hand, the break occurs at a point somewhat removed from that at which the traumatic injury was inflicted. Bone fractures occur most frequently in men of middle age or of advanced years; such an accident being greatly favored by the condition of senile oste- oporosis. In youthful individuals, on the other hand, one often encounters instances of a traumatic separa- tion of the epiphyses. The alterations which take place at the point of fracture immediately after the escape of blood into the soft parts and the infiltration of these with serum and cellular elements—alterations which constitute the first step in the healing process—consist in the formation of a spindle-shaped tumor, which at first has a soft consistence, but later assumes a certain degree of toughness. This tumor-like mass of tissue is the so-called callus. It is customary to distinguish three kinds of callus, in accordance with the differ- ences in the localities from which it develops. The first kind is the external or periosteal callus, which surrounds the fractured ends of the bone like a ring. It is the product of an ossifying periostitis. The second kind is the inner or myelogenic callus, which unites the two sections of the medullary canal. And, finally, there is the third kind, the intermediary callus,

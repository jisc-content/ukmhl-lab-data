193 THE BONES AND JOINTS. point of fracture, what is termed a false joint (pseud- artlirosis) . Other local causes may also bring about the same unfavorable termination. Thus, for exam- ple, it may be effected by unduly strong pressure upon the point of fracture, especially in cases of compli- cated fracture; by the interposition of soft parts be- tween the ends of the fragments; by imperfect contact between the opposite surfaces of the fractured ends; and by imperfect immobilization of the parts. As re- gards the other complications of a bone fracture, the most important is fat embolism, which occurs quite regularly. The semifluid, broken-down bone marrow is taken up by the torn and gaping veins, and through them is conveyed, in the form of drops of fat, to the right side of the heart. From this point it is carried to the lungs and, to a certain extent, to the peripheral portions of the body—to the kidneys, the brain, and the muscular tissue of the heart. When the bone is seriously injured and a good deal of destruction takes place, this f-at embolism may favor or be the actual cause of a fatal termination in the course of the first few days after the occurrence of the injury. Rachitis. (Plate 40.) Rachitis is a disease of growing bone—a disturb- ance of the metabolic changes which leads to a dimin- ished deposit of calcareous material. Fundamentally the disease consists in an excessive formation of oste- oid tissue—i.e., of the material which constitutes the groundwork of bone—without an adequate deposition of chalky material. In the long tubular bones the

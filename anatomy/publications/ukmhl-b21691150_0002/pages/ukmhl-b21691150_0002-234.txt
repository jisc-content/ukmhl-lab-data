ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 116 nected in some way either with menstruation or with a variety of pathological conditions. The increased flow of blood during the menstrual period (when it reaches the point at which it may be spoken of as a menorrhagia) is often due to constitu- tional causes (such as a hemorrhagic diathesis, or one of the infectious or toxic general diseases), or it may be dependent upon some local disease of the uter- ine mucous membrane (hemorrhagic endometritis, or some form of new growth, like a submucous myoma, a mucous polypus, or a carcinoma). Hemorrhages outside the uterus, in its immediate vicinity, are either intraperitoneal or subperitoneal, or else they combine both characteristics. Intraperi- toneal hemorrhages which'take place into Douglasâ€™ space and which often, after coagulation has taken place, become encapsulated, constitute tumors of considerable size (pelvic kaematoma, retro-uterine or peri-uterine hfematocele, Plate 22). The blood which is thus poured out comes from the ovaries, from follicular cysts which have burst, or from the Fallopian tubes (rupture of a hsematosalpinx, a tubal pregnancy). Finally, a proliferative pelveo-perito- nitis, when associated with the new formation of blood-vessels, may take on a hemorrhagic character and lead to the formation of an inflammatory hsema- toma. Such accumulations of blood generally undergo absorption, and, when this happens, a rusty brown or a slate-colored discoloration of the pelvic peritoneum remains behind. It is only in rare cases that the mass breaks down into pus, which then finds an out- let either into the rectum or into the vagina, and that a diffuse fatal peritonitis is set up.

The disease is considered to be pursuing an unfavorable course when separate centres of necrosis develop and sequestra are formed. The bone undergoes rarefaction, and shows (especially in the skull) not only quite large defects, but also a worm-eaten appearance. In the case of the tubular bones a rather thick shell of bone sometimes forms around them. The bony walls surrounding the sequestrum appear to be thickened and very uneven on their external surface. The bones which are located near the surface of the body seem to be specially liable to be affected with syphilitic disease. The following are favorite seats of the disease: the bones of the skull cap (particu- larly the tabular part of the frontal bone and the parietal bones); the bony framework of the nose, and the hard palate; the diaphyses of the tubular bones â€”especially of the leg and of the forearm; and, finally, the clavicle and the bodies of the vertebrae. The bones of the framework of the nose are often secondarily involved in cases of syphilitic ulceration of the mucous membrane. When in this way the bone is left bare, it is likely to undergo necrosis. Then, again, a primary gummous periostitis and os- teitis may attack the bones of the nose, in which case the necrotic bone fragments become loosened and are eventually cast out. When the necrotic process cov- ers a wide extent, the nose may be deprived of its bony support; and when the cribriform plate of the ethmoid is destroyed, the bridge of the nose sinks in, like the seat of a saddle. Oftentimes the necrosis at-

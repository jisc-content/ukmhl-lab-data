185 NERVOUS APPARATUS. Tabes Dorsalis. The gray degeneration of the posterior columns, which has been found to he the characteristic lesion in tabes, is easily recognized macroscopically through the overlying soft membranes, and may be still more plainly seen upon the surface of a section, which reveals clearly the symmetrical degenerative atrophy and induration of the posterior columns. These col- umns, which have an abnormal grayish color, are seen, on the section, to have sunken down to a lower level, and to be narrower than they should be. A similar state of things can be shown to exist in the posterior horns and in the posterior nerve roots. The so- called root zones, Goll’s columns in the cervical por- tion of the cord, and Lissauer’s fields are almost con- stantly affected, whereas the anterior portions of the posterior columns in the lumbar portion of the cord, and the so-called posterior external fields in the cer- vical and thoracic portions of the cord, are almost always spared. The disease of the posterior root fibres begins at the points where they enter the spinal cord. In tabes the disease does not confine itself to the spinal cord alone: it involves also the entire nervous system. The evidence in favor of this is to be found in the extensive pathological changes which take place in the peripheral nerves as well as in many of the cerebral nerves (the optic nerve, and the nerves supplying the muscles of the eye). Tabes occurs much oftener in men than in women, and it develops chiefly in individuals between thirty-

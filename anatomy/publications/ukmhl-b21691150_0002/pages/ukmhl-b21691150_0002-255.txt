SEXUAL APPARATUS. 137 cicatrices are often encountered in the fossa navicu- laris; and as a secondary development there may ap- pear, in connection with these, a chronic ulcerating proctitis and periproctitis, a process of disease which is likely to result in the production of callosities in the soft parts and in the formation of fistuke (recto- vaginal fistulse). Injuries and ruptures of the vagina occur most often as a result of childbirth or of some violent mechanical interference (as with instruments). These tears or ruptures are generally located in the side walls of the vagina and they usually follow a longitudinal direc- tion; they may also be situated in the vault of the vagina. Tears at the entrance to the vagina and in the peri- neum are of frequent occmrence in connection with the act of giving birth to a child. Aside from simple superficial tears of the frenulum, four different vari- eties of ruptured perineum are distinguished, viz.: 1, rupture of the perineum of the first grade, in which both the frenulum and the vestibular portion of the perineal mucous membrane are torn; 2, rupture of the perineum of the second grade, in which the tear ex- tends as far as to the sphincter ani; 3, central rupture of the perineumâ€”a canal-shaped rupture, which ex- tends from the vagina through the perineum, but does not involve the anterior part (the frenulum); 4, rupture of the perineum of the third grade, or complete rupture of the perineum, in which condition the peri- neum throughout its entire extent (including a part of the rectum) is torn. As a rule, injuries of this nature are likely to heal by the formation of a cica- trix. But then also, on the other hand, the torn sur-

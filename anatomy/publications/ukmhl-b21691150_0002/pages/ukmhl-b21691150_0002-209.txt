91 SEXUAL APPARATUS. (fistulse testis tuberculosse) are formed, and from these a thin pus escapes. The tuberculous process spreads from the free extremity of the epididymis to its main portion and head, and then finally to the testicle itself, and even at times to the other genital organs.* When thus involved the testicle usually be- comes greatly enlarged, and in the vicinity of the larger focus of cheesy disease miliary tubercles will be found scattered throughout the tissues of the gland. These tubercles increase in size, coalesce to form larger masses, and eventually undergo in their turn cheesy degeneration. Hydrocele is a frequent complication of the disease. Spontaneous healing and an arrest of all active disease do sometimes occur without operative interference, but this result is very rarely observed. A cheesy and tuberculous inflam- mation (orchitis tuberculosa diffusa) which, from the very start, is spread diffusely throughout the entire testicle, and which runs a subacute course, is also very rarely encountered. Syphilis op the Testicle. There are two forms of the disease: 1, an intersti- tial fibrous orchitis, and 2, a granuloma. In the first form the inflammation begins in the corpus Highmori and produces a thickening and proliferation of the connective-tissue elements of the gland. The ulti- mate results are usually atrophy of the glandular pa- renchyma and complete disappearance of the entire gland. Gummata or syphilomata either develop indepen- dently or else appear in connection with a diffuse in-

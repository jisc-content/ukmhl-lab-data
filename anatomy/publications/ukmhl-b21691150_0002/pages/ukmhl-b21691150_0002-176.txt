58 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. and it may develop in the course of pregnancy, as well as without any demonstrable cause (a chilling of the body?). (Plate 7.) In the first stage of the condition commonly termed cloudy swelling the kidney appears to be enlarged and its capsule can easily be removed. The color of the organ is a dull grayish-red or a pale gray. In a section the cortical zone will be seen to be broader than normal, and usually paler than the medullary substance. A decidedly oedematous appearance of the cortex will also be observed, and the normal stri- ations will be seen somewhat indistinctly. By pass- ing the edge of the scalpel over the cut surface of the kidney, under moderate pressure, an abundance of an opaque grayish fluid will be obtained. Pressure upon the papillae affords escape to a grayish-wliite juice which contains large quantities of cast-off epithelial cells (indicative of a desquamative or catarrhal ne- phritis). In specially severe cases blood escapes from the vessels by diapedesis into the capsular space of the glomeruli and also to some extent into the uri- niferous canaliculi (hemorrhagic nephritis). The epithelial cells are swollen as if in a dropsical con- dition, and small particles like dust are scattered throughout their protoplasmic contents. Further- more, many of them show evidences of disintegra- tion. Hyaline and epithelial casts are found in the urine; the hyaline ones owdng their origin to the solidification of albumin, particularly in the loops and intercalated portions. * Under favorable conditions, as when the primary process shows a tendency to subside, all these path- ological changes disappear in a short space of time,

Explanation of Plate 16. Puerperal Septic Endometritis. The uterus is as large as a man’s fist, its walls meas- uring 2 cm. in thickness; its cavity, which is dilated, contains only scanty quantities of a dirty-grayish fluid mixed with altered blood. The mucous membrane dis- plays shallow folds and small nodules, is discolored, and is covered in many places with superficial eschars. The os uteri is indented at several points. The vaginal mucous membrane presents an opaque and velvety ap- pearance. In this patient—a woman thirty-five years old, who had died, twenty-four days after the birth of her child, with symptoms which pointed to a severe puerperal septico- pycemia—numerous pathological alterations were found, viz., ichorous peri- and para-metritis; septic purulent thrombo-phlebitis of the left external iliac vein, of the common iliac vein, of the left femoral vein, and of the left vena saphena magna; anasarca of the left lower extremity (phlegmasia alba dolens); embolic plugging of the branches of the pulmonary arteries supplying both upper lobes of the lungs; and, finally, a metastatic ulcerous and thrombotic acute endocarditis of the mitral valve, with secondary embolic and gangrenous infarctions in the spleen and left kidney. Great septic enlargement of the spleen, this organ being u early four times as large as it should be. On both nates extensive bedsores were found, the soft parts in these places having broken down into an ichorous pus. (No. 90, 1895.) In the present case, which represents a combination of septico-pyaemia with ischorrhsemia, it is a circumstance worthy of remark that the veins and lymphatics of the uterus and its adnexa manifested—at least macroscopi- cally—no characteristic alterations; and, further, that even the primary septic process in the endometrium was already, at the time when death occurred, in process of subsiding.

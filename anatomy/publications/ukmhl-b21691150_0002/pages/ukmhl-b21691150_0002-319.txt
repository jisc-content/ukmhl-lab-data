201 THE BONES AND JOINTS. myelitis seems to develop as a sequence to some trivial suppurative process. The bones most often affected are the tibia, the femur, and the humerus, while the other tubular bones of the extremities are comparatively seldom involved. At first there is a stage of hypersemia, accompanied or not, as the case may be, by small hemorrhages; then follows the transformation of the fatty marrow into lymphoid tissue; and this, in turn, is soon fol- lowed by a constantly increasing infiltration of the latter with pus corpuscles, until it assumes a grayish- white or yellowish color. Ultimately purulent foci develop in this transformed marrow. While in this stage the disease often ends in death, with the symp- toms of an acute septicaemia or septico-pyaemia; or it may involve the surrounding bone substance, and lead to its disintegration—i.e., to caries and necrosis, with the formation of sequestra and the establishment of a fistulous channel through which a small sequestrum may be expelled. Very often subperiosteal abscesses develop in connection with the disease; and still an- other accompanying phenomenon may be the produc- tion—proceeding from the periosteum—of a number of osteophytes or of a mass of bone substance, which surrounds the sequestrum like a box splint. Toward the healthy end of the bone an ossifying osteomyelitis takes place, and this produces a condition of sclerosis of the medullary cavity; the destructive disease being in this manner shut off, as it were, from the rest of the body. In acute osteomyelitis the rarefying osteitis may sometimes lead to the production of deformities, but it rarely leads to softening and curvature of the bone.

Now and then a case is observed in which a purulent chronic cystitis (both with and without diverticula) is associated with a purulent inflammation of the connective tissue surrounding the bladder—a para- cystitis which terminates in the formation of a dis- tinct abscess—or with an inflammation of its perito- neal coat—a pericystitis. Tuberculous cystitis is a disease of rare occurrence. The lesions usually found are small and medium- sized lentil-shaped ulcers with shallow cheesy floors and sharp indented borders. These ulcers rapidly increase in size through the confluence of two or more smaller ones. Catarrh of the bladder is usually present at the same time. Not infrequently tubercu- losis of the kidneys, the prostate gland, the testicle, and the spermatic cord (genito-urinary tuberculosis) is associated with the bladder lesions. Urinary Fistul®. Among the different fistulous communications which are observed between the ureter, the bladder, and the urethra and neighboring organs, the vesico-vaginal fistula is the one most often encountered. These fis- tulse often develop in a gradual manner; as, for ex- ample, when a carcinoma of the uterus invades the anterior wall of the vagina, and then, extending from here to the posterior wall of the bladder, gradually causes the normal tissues involved to break down. And then if, at the same time, the posterior wall of

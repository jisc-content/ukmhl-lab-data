In those cases in which the inflam- mation is somewhat intense and lasts for a sufficient length of time, the process involves the parenchyma of the kidney—pyelo-nephritis. The purulent pyelo-nephritis in a case like this is an ascending process, inasmuch as the inflammation can easily be traced from the bladder upward through the ureters to the pelvis. In the great majority of cases an analogous cystitis—one which agrees, both etiologically and as regards the pathological altera- tions, with that referred to above—furnishes the start- ing-point of the kidney disease. As illustrations may be mentioned the secondary cystitis which develops as a result of enlargement of the prostate, or that which owes its origin to a stricture of the urethra or to a paralysis of the urinary bladder; and, finally, the cystitis which develops when suppurative proc- esses in the pelvic cavity lead to perforation into the bladder. In ascending pyelo-nephritis the following patholog- ical conditions are found: The pelvis of the kidney is filled with a discolored purulent fluid, the papillae are covered with a coating of cast-off dead tissue, and, finally, throughout the medullary substance are scat- tered elongated abscesses, which give a striated ap- pearance to the region. These abscesses, which are in the urinary canaliculi, contain large numbers of leucocytes and proliferating epithelial cells, and the tissues surrounding them are infiltrated with small cells. The pathogenic micro-organisms (usually bac- terium coli and proteus) are collected together inside the urinary canaliculi and the lymph vessels, hut not

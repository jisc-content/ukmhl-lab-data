178 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Syphilis of the Brain. Syphilomata of the brain (gummata) belong among the late products of syphilis. They are more fre- quent in adults than in children and youthful individ- uals. These growths vary in size, and there are often several of them in the same brain. In their early stages of development they are of a soft, gelatinous consistence. They are at times more or less inti- mately associated in their development with a gum- mous meningitis; then, again, at other times, they develop independently in the brain substance. In the more advanced stages of their growth the char- acter of these syphilomata changes, one part becom- ing tougher in consistence, while another undergoes partial cheesy necrosis. While they are in this con- dition it is an easy matter to mistake syphilomata for solitary tubercles. Syphilitic arteritis is often pres- ent in the brain at the same time. Then, besides, still other pathological alterations of a syphilitic char- acter are generally found simultaneousl}’’, not only in the brain (e.g., multiple centres of softening in the cerebral hemispheres), but also in other parts of the body. Tumors of the Brain and Spinal Cord, and of their Membranes. Malignant tumors (carcinoma, sarcoma) may de- velop in the brain, through metastatic agencies. The following varieties of tumors are observed as primary growths in the brain: Glioma, glio-sarcoma, and all the different varieties of sarcoma (glio-sar-

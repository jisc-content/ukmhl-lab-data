Generally these different tumors occur only singly in the brain. In rare instances, however, more than one may be found. They vary in size from the di- mensions of an English walnut to those of a hen’s egg, or even of a man’s fist. They are found most often on the surface of the brain, in the neighborhood of the walls of the ventricles, and in the cerebellum. Their predilection for these particular parts of the brain is closely connected with their origin in some mechanical injury—an origin which can often be demonstrated. The gliomata and sarcomata are gen- erally of a semisolid consistence (fairly fluctuating under digital pressure). They have a grayish color and a moist, glistening surface; and in some forms— particularly the angio-sarcomata—hemorrhagic foci are disseminated throughout the substance of the tumor. (This last fact explains the employment, in earlier days, of such terms as hemorrhagic sarco- mata, fungus hsematodes, and Blutscliwamm.) When the tumor grows to be of considerable size, and when it has been in existence for a long time, some por- tions of it (especially the central portions) present an opaque and yellowish appearance, indicative of the necrosis and fatty degeneration that have already de- veloped at these points in consequence of defective nutrition of the tissues.

At a more advanced stage it will be found to have undergone a change into an opaque yellow, crum- bling, friable, fissured mass, in the midst of which a few miliary and even somewhat larger yellowish tuber- cles may be seen. In addition to this diffuse cheesy infiltration of the mucous membrane, miliary nodules, and occasionally also papillary tuberculous vegeta- tions, are also encountered—particularly in the cervix uteri—in exceptional cases. Owing to the retention of these products of inflammation intermingled with pus, the cavity of the uterus becomes dilated (pyo- metra), and often at the same time other pathological conditions will be found to be present; such as, for example, tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes and pyosalpinx, tuberculosis of the pelvic peritoneum, and intestinal tuberculosis. Perimetritis; Pelveo-Peritonitis. (Plate 23.) This disease either appears as a part of a diffuse peritonitis, in which the exudation and the local alter- ations of the serous membrane are generally most pronounced in the pelvic peritoneum, or else the in- flammation develops out of some disease of the va- gina, the uterus, or the Fallopian tubes, and more particularly in connection with some gonorrhoeal or septic puerperal process involving these pelvic organs. The inflammation of the serous membrane runs an acute, a subacute, or a chronic course. The exuda- tion varies in character, being at one time an opaque serum (partly serum and partly cellular elements), at

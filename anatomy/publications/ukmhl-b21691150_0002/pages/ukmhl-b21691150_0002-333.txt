215 THE BONES AND JOINTS. like envelopes of bone came to be formed; and these, in their turn, as the growth of the tumor advanced, were to a certain extent absorbed. The spaces separating the parallel ridges of bone on the outer side of the tumor indicate the spots where this shell of bone was completely ab- sorbed. The tumor has a very tough consistence, and creaks when cut with the knife. It is knobbed and lobulated in its structure. Under the microscope it shows a fibrillated tissue, containing very few cells and blood-vessels. At first, the fact that this was a tumor, or new growth, was not appreci- ated; it was supposed to be a simple periostitis. Two years ago the pa- tient had an attack of mumps, and from that time onward the growth in- creased slowly in size. Seven months before the operation was performed a tooth was extracted, with the expectation that this would facilitate the discharge of the pus wThich was supposed to be confined within the swollen tissues. Finally, resection and exarticulation of the diseased jaw were performed (by Privatdocent Dr. von Stubenrauch), and the wound healed in the course of three weeks.* Fig. 13.—Multiple Chondromata of the Fingers. (From a child.) On the fingers of the left hand—with the exception of the thumb and little finger—there is quite a number of roundish, hard nodules, which in some places are more or less fused together, and which consist of cartilage tissue. * A more detailed description of this case will be found in the disserta- tion of Gottfried Kentenich, entitled: “Ueber Kieferflbrome.” Munich, 1896. (This dissertation contains the complete statistics of all the cases of fibroma of the jaw which have thus far been observed.)

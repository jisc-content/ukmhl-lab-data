NERVOUS APPARATUS. 165 Cerebral Hemorrhage; Apoplexy. (Plates 32 and 33.) Hemorrhages into the parenchyma of the brain occur from various causes: 1. As the result of a general hemorrhagic diathesis, such as is observed in certain severe infectious dis- eases, in scurvy, in pernicious anaemia, and in leukae- mia, in which conditions the hemorrhagic foci are multiple in character and vary in size. 2. As secondary phenomena in connection with certain new growths (sarcoma, glioma), or with cen- tres of softening which have resulted from processes of degeneration and necrosis. 3. As the result of some mechanical injury. In this case the apoplexies are usually located in the more superficial parts of the brain substance, or else in or near the walls of the cerebral ventricles. These apoplexies occur most frequently in consequence of injuries to the skull cap, such as are produced by a blunt force, by a ball shot from a gun, by a stab or other punctured wound, etc. They may also occur without any demonstrable injury of the skull cap, as in the so-called concussion of the brain, in which, besides a diffuse molecular injury of the cerebral cor- tex, capillary apoplexies, disseminated contusions, and centres of softening may be present; these le- sions being of such a nature that they are very likely to lead to alterations in the blood-vessels and to late apoplectic attacks. In cases of contusions and me- chanical injuries of the cerebral cortex the ganglion cells may undergo necrosis and calcification. A trau-

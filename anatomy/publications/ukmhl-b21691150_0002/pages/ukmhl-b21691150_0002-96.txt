Explanation of Plate 28. Acute Purulent Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. (.Lumbar Portion of the Spinal Cord.) When the dural sac was opened, the soft membranes presented a cloudy appearance; they had lost their natural degree of transparency, and displayed in some places red spots. The meshes of the arachnoideus and pia were filled with a grayish-white (in some places yel- lowish and yellowish-white) exudation which varied in character; being gelatinous at some points, sero-purulent at others, and distinctly purulent at still others. A similar exudation, but of varying thickness, was found throughout the middle and upper portions of the spinal cord, along the base of the brain, and extending up over the side of this organ as far as to the convexity of the left hemisphere. It was also found that the infectious purulent inflammation had involved the plexus of veins and the walls of the lateral ventricles; the latter cavities being filled with a sero-purulent fluid (pyocephalus in- ternus). The duration of the entire illness, which throughout pursued the typical course of an attack of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, was fourteen days. The patient, a woman thirty-two years of age, died in convulsions (clonic spasms). The other pathological al- terations found in this case were: Anaemia of the com- ponent tissues of the brain and spinal cord; hypostatic congestion of both lower lobes of the lungs; and cyanosis of the kidneys.

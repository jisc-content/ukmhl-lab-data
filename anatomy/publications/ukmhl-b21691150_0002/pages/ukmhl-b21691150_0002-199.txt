81 URINARY APPARATUS. teria which gain an entrance into the bladder usually come from the urethra, the introduction of a catheter serving to convey them from the latter locality. But they are competent to set up a catarrhal inflammation of the bladder only when there exists at the same time stagnation of the urine (such as may result from a stricture of the urethra, from enlargement of the pros- tate, or from paralysis of the muscular walls of the bladder), or when the mucous membrane has been more or less injured (as may happen when a calculus is present). There is such a disease as gonorrhoeal cystitis, but it is of rare occurrence. The gonococci are then sometimes found, not only in the cavity of the blad- der, but also in the capillaries and precapillary veins of the organ. In chronic cystitis both the mucous membrane proper and the submucosa are markedly thickened, and so too is the muscular coat (trabecular hyper- trophy of the bladder, the lattice-work bladder). In addition to the fact that it has an abnormal slatey- gray color, the mucous membrane presents the ap- pearance of a grating or a honeycomb; this arrange- ment being due to the fact that the underlying bands of muscular fibres, which have become hypertrophied in an irregular manner, stand out prominently like the bars of a grating, and so communicate the same conformation to the mucous membrane which covers them. In the higher degrees of this hypertrophy the mucous membrane of the bladder presents an appear- ance very similar to that of the interior of the ventri- cles of the heart. Between the powerfully developed muscle bundles, pocketsâ€”some quite shallow and 6

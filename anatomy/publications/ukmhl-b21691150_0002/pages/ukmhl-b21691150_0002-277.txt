Tuberculous meningitis is a disease which occurs chiefly during early childhood and youth, but it does sometimes also occur, in the case of human beings, in middle age and the advanced period of life. Now and then (say in four or five per cent of all cases) the tuberculous meningitis is simply one of the manifesta- tions of a general acute outbreak of miliary tuber- culosis. Syphilitic Meningitis. In syphilitic disease of the cerebral membranes (men- ingitis gummosa) the latter, as a rule, become dif- fusely infiltrated and thickened. The process mani- fests a tendency to spread, and eventually all the membranes of the brain are converted by it into a thick and tough, whitish, skin-like mass, which shows, at different points, cheesy degeneration and cicatricial sclerosis of the tissues. At a later stage the disease may involve the bony structures of the skull and the brain itself. The favorite seat of a gummous meningitis is at the base of the brain. The blood-vessels—especially the arteries—manifest quite regularly the tissue alterations which character- ize an obliterating peri-arteritis, a meso-arteritis, and an endarteritis of syphilitic origin. One of the sec- ondary results of these alterations is atrophy of the cerebral cortex. In the early forms of cerebral syph- ilis—those which develop only a few months after infection has taken place—the only lesions found may be simply those of a syphilitic arteritis in the neigh- borhood of the base of the brain.

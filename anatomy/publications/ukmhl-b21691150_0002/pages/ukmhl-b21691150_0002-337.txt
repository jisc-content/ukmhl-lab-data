THE BONES AND JOINTS. 219 grow in an irregular fashion and at an early stage eat their way through the bone. 2. Periosteal sarcomata. These grow from the inner layers of the periosteum, which then surrounds the tumor like a fibrous cap- sule. The destruction of the bone, in these cases, takes place from without inward. These periosteal sarcomata, which are usually of the spindle-cell vari- ety, are of a more malignant character; they are often so soft as to fluctuate, and they show a greater ten- dency to produce metastases. A bony framework is often developed in these tumors through the conver- sion of the newly formed connective tissue or cartilage tissue into osseous tissue. Such growths are desig- nated as osteosarcomata. DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. Luxation. (Plate 50.) The terms luxation and dislocation are commonly understood to mean an anomalous condition of a joint, of such a character that the articular end of one bone fails to come in contact with the articular end of an- other (the associated) bone, and protrudes through a rupture in the articular capsule. When only certain parts of the capsule and ligaments are torn, while at the same time the articular ends of the bones remain in contact, it is customary to designate the lesion as a distortion or a sprain. Of the two parts involved in a luxation or disloca- tion that which lies nearest to the periphery is spoken of as the dislocated part. Thus, for example, in a

109 SEXUAL APPARATUS. tubes are converted into tough and rigid structures, and the mucous membrane presents the appearance of being fissured and in a state of cheesy necrosis. The process can travel in a downward direction, start- ing from the abdominal orifice (as an extension of tuberculous disease of the peritoneum), or it may travel upward along the tube from the iiterus as a starting-point. New growths of the Fallopian tubes are extremely rare. Those hitherto seen were fibromata, myomata, and papillomata. Tubal Pregnancy. (Plate 22.) The so-called extra-uterine pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy) occurs in a varietj" of forms. They are as follows: 1. Abdominal pregnancy (graviditas abdominalis), of which there are two varietiesâ€”the peritoneal and the extraperitoneal. The fructified egg may develop in any part of the peritoneum or between the layers of the ovarian ligament, close to the hilus of the ovary. 2. Ovarian pregnancy (graviditas ovarialis), in which the development of the egg takes place upon the ovary. 3. Tubal pregnancy (graviditas tubaria). When the ovum develops in the commencement of the tube (the uterine portion), the condition is termed an in- terstitial or tubo-uterine pregnancy (a very rare vari- ety). In a second form the ovum develops in the free part of the tube; and to this the term tubal preg-

125 SEXUAL APPARATUS. fungous endometritis, hypertrophic endometritis, and proliferating endometritis are applied. When poly- poid growths spring from this thickened mucous membrane, it is customary in speaking of the con- dition to apply to it the term endometritis polyposa. Polypi of this character are often pedunculate, and they may contain small or even quite large mucous cysts, which have originated through the obliteration of the mouths of glands and the retention of their secretion. These fungous forms of chronic endome- tritis which are associated with catarrhal symptoms are usually not of bacterial origin; germs are not found in them. Both in the acute and in the chronic forms of cer- vical endometritis it very often happens that erosions develop upon the vaginal portion of the uterus. The picture presented under these circumstances is that of a mucous membrane very much reddened in the vicinity of the external orifice of the uterus, having an uneven and somewhat excoriated surface, and pre- senting some actual ulcerations of slight depth. Pa- pillary excrescences (as well as papillary erosions) and follicular ulcerations are also among the lesions which are sometimes observed. As a result of inflammatory swelling of the cervical mucous membrane the outer orifice of the uterus protrudes to a greater or less extent (ectropium). Chronic endometritis often develops from a gonor- rhoeal infection, or the cause may be found in pus cocci, and this is very apt to be the case in the inter- stitial variety of the disease. The latter may also develop as a sequel to birth at term or a miscarriage; or it may follow some operative interference; or,

190 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. FkACTUEES OF THE BONES. (Plates 38 and 39.) The term traumatic fracture is employed when the bone breaks in consequence of a force applied from without; while a spontaneous fracture is held to be one in which the bone breaks under the influence of a minimal force (entirely inadequate to cause the frac- ture of a normal bone). Spontaneous fractures, for example, owe their origin to processes which render the bones brittle. Such are malignant and destructive tumors (carcinoma, sarcoma); inflammatory processes (osteomyelitis, tu- berculosis, syphilis, caries, necrosis); and, finally, rachitis and osteomalacia. Traumatic fractures are either subcutaneous (i. e., simple, or not complicated), without a simultaneous injury of the overlying skin and soft parts; or com- plicated (i.e., open), as when the point of fracture, owing to the injury of the skin and soft parts, com- municates with the outer air. The fracture is incomplete, or constitutes a fissure, when the line of the break is a mere crack in the bone, while its outer form remains undisturbed. Such fractures are quite common in the skull cap. In the group of incomplete fractures belongs the.condi- tion which is termed infraction (green-stick fracture). In this condition the bone is only bent, in very much the same way as an elastic quill becomes partially fractured when too much force is used in bending it. The complete fractures of bone are divided into trans- verse, oblique, longitudinal, and spiral fractures, accord-

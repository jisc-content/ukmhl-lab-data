ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 15G blood channels), in the course of a septicaemia or a pyaemia, of an erysipelas, or of a pneumonia. The exudation is sero-purulent or fibrino-purulent in char- acter, and is usually found distributed throughout the meshes of the pia mater, and more particularly be- tween the convolutions and in the immediate neigh- borhood of the blood-vessels, which present the ap- pearance of having whitish-yellow or yellowish-green margins. The cerebral cortex, which participates to a greater or less degree in the inflammation, is in a congested state, and cellular elements are scattered throughout its substance. Occasionally capillary apoplexies are found in the cortex, in addition to the alterations just enumerated—a combination of lesions which justifies the use of the term meningo-enceplia- litis. Recovery is a rare event; in the majority of instances death follows in the course of a few days. It very rarely happens, in these forms of menin- gitis, or even in purulent epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, that the purulent inflammation extends to the plexuses of veins and to the ventricular epen- dyma (thus setting up an endomeningitis). When this extension does take place the contents of the ventricles will be found to be more or less cloudy —rarely of a sero-purulent character — and of a yellowish-green color. To this condition the term pyocephalus internus is commonly given. 2. Purulent basilar meningitis, or epidemic cerebro- spinal meningitis. In this form of meningitis the in- fectious process localizes itself at the base of the brain and along the spinal cord. As the cause of this inflammation—which almost always terminates

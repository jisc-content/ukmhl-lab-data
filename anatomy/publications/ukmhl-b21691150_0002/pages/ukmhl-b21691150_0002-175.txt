URINARY APPARATUS. 57 3); and in tliis case tlie surface of the kidney is likely to present, after the capsule has been stripped off, a certain number of purulent foci, each of which has more or less the shape of a wedge and is sur- rounded with a red zone. Nephritis. (Inflammation of the Kidneys.) Two kinds of inflammation of the substance of the kidney are recognized, viz., the idiopathic and the secondary. In the former the disease is apt to run a chronic course, while in the latter the nephritis is generally of an acute nature. Then, besides, it is customary to distinguish a parenchymatous and an interstitial variety of inflammation of the kidney, not to mention a number of mixed and transitional forms of the disease. The more rapid the development of a nephritis, and the shorter the course which it runs, the more likely is it that we shall find the excreting parenchyma alone involved; while in a nephritis of long duration the degree in which the connective- tissue framework of the kidney participates in the inflammation will be directly proportionate to the duration of the disease. Acute Parenchymatous Nephritis. (Plate 7 and Plate 9, Fig. a.) This disease may be caused by a number of infec- tious and toxic agencies, such as scarlet fever, vari- ous febrile processes (sepsis, typhoid fever, diph- theria), different poisons (e.g., cantharides), etc.;

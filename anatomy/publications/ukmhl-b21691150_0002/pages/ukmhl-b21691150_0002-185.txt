URINARY APPARATUS. 67 somewhat washed out and indistinct. If the edge of the knife is passed lightly over the cut surface of the kidney a cloudy, rather thickisli juice will be ob- tained. When the fatty degeneration occurs in scattered areas, the organ presents a more spotted appearance, and small, ill-defined yellow and yellow- ish-white spots will be found scattered throughout the pale, swollen, and juicy kidney substance. Amyloid Kidney. In that form of degeneration which produces the amyloid or the lardaceous kidney, the organ is en- larged, of a dull gray and grayish-yellow color, and marked with numerous fine spots which represent disseminated areas of a secondary fatty degeneration. So far as the size and the color are concerned this variety of kidney shows a certain resemblance to the large white kidney (subchronic parenchymatous and interstitial inflammation). The amyloid degenera- tion generally begins in the capillary coils of the glomeruli and in the finer arteries; but, when the disease has reached an advanced stage of its course, the amyloid change involves not only the interstitial tissue but also the tunica propria of the urinary cana- liculi. The lardaceous metamorphosis develops in the course of serious chronic disturbances of nutri- tion; as, for example, in chronic pulmonary tuber- culosis, in tuberculous bone disease, in old syphilitic cases, and in chronic suppurations, especially of bony structures. The occurrence of the disease without any known cause is a rare event. The possibility of a cure is scarcely to be thought of.

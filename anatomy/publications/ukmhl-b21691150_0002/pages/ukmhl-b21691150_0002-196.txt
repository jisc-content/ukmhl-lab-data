ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 78 in the blood-vessels. If, besides these, other micro- organisms (staphylococci, for example) are found, then the inference may as a rule be drawn that the case is one in which a mixed pysemic infection has taken place. If the purulent foci extend from the papilla) to the surface of the kidney, the enveloping capsule may become involved in the inflammation; in other words, there may be a purulent perinephritis and paranephritis. In descending hcematogenous metastatic nephritis and nephro-pyelitis multiple abscesses will be found in the cortex directly beneath the capsule. These abscesses, which are either of embolic or simply of metastatic origin, belong among the manifestations of an infec- tion of the blood—embolic septico-pyaemia. In this form of disease the pathogenic micro-organisms (pus cocci, pneumococci, typhoid bacilli) are found in the pus, in the inflamed tissues, and in the blood-vessels, secondary aggregations of the micro-parasites being only rarely found in the urinary canaliculi. In both forms of the disease (ascending and de- scending pyelo-nephritis) the issue is almost always a fatal one, through sepsis, septico-pyaemia, and uraemia. DISEASES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. Rupture and Perforation op the Urinary Bladder. Traumatic ruptures of the bladder—due to a blow, to a fall from a height, or to the fact of a person’s being run over—occur when the organ is, at the time, more or less full. The rupture, which generally takes

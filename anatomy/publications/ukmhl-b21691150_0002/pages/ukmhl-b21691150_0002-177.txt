URINARY APPARATUS. 59 and newly reproduced epithelium speedily takes the place of that which has been cast off. Under unfavorable conditions the stage of cloudy swelling is succeeded earlier or later by that of fatty degeneration. In the stage of fatty degeneration the enlarged kid- ney presents the following characteristics: Its color as a whole is pale gray; the tissues contain scarcely any blood, and they break down easily; and the or- gan appears decidedly spotted, by reason of the fact that there are small areas of a pale yellow or some- what whitish color—spots which correspond to the regions where the fatty degeneration of the epithe- lium has advanced to a higher degree. (Plate 9, Fig. a.) In quite a number of cases the process advances still further, and there is established either a subacute or, more rarely, a chronic parenchymatous nephritis— a form of renal disease which is often also termed the “large white kidney” or the “large spotted kidney.” (Plate 8.) In this last form of renal disease the kidneys are half as large again as they normally should be, and in a few instances they are even larger. Their color is a washed-out whitish gray, and they are distinctly spotted. The normal striations of the cortex are not distinguishable. In respect of their consistence these organs are generally a little tough. Under the micro- scope the following alterations may generally be rec- ognized: Swelling, cloudiness, and proliferation of the epithelial cells of the urinifei’ous canaliculi; fatty degeneration of these cells, distributed unsymmetri- cally throughout the tissues; frequently proliferating

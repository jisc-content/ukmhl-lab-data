Explanation of Plate 35. Porencephalia in the Left Temporal Lobe, with Encysted Meningeal LLematoma. At the base of the brain, at a spot corresponding to the left fossa Sylvii, there is a bladder, about as large as a small apple, which fluctuates and is filled with fluid. To ward the median line it extends as far as to the middle of the chiasma; toward the outside it extends as far as the margin of the base of the brain; and in a forward direction it is limited by the frontal lobe. The color of this bladder is in part a dirty yellowish-brown, in part that of iron rust. Delicate blood-vessels are visible upon its surface. In the region of the right fossa Sylvii there is a smaller bladder, about as large as an English walnut, which is filled with a clear serous fluid. The margins of both these bladder-like structures were found to be so intimately united with the neighboring cerebral cortex that all our efforts to effect a separation proved unavailing. The cause of death in this patient—a girl four and a half years old—was diphtheria of the larynx; and, in addition, there were found : Double croupous pneumonia, excessive general emaciation, anaemia, and rhachitis.

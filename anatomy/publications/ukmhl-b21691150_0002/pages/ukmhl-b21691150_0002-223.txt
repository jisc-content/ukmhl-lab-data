SEXUAL APPARATUS. 105 enty per cent) cystaclenomata develop in women who have not yet reached the age of forty, while the num- ber of instances in which the disease has been found between the ages of forty and fifty amounts to only twenty per cent. The disease is comparatively rare in advanced life. 3. Dermoid cysts of the ovaries constitute between three and four per cent of all ovarian tumors. They belong in fact to the teratoid tumors. They are usu- ally of moderate size; they grow slowly, and they are of congenital origin. The inner wall of these cysts resembles in structure the external skin. The tissue elements present are epidermis, hairs, hair follicles, and both sebaceous and sweat glands. Small projecting nodules (rudimentary cephalic caps) are also observed. These contain portions of bone with teeth, and often the rudiments of brain substance, eyes, and ciliated endoderm. The rudi- ments of the circulatory apparatus (heart, blood-ves- sels) or of the kidneys are never found. The con- ditions observed here, therefore, do not indicate displaced embryonal germs, but rather parasitic foetuses, or rudimentary ovarian parasites, or the abortive malformation of an egg cell. The free contents of the cysts consist of a sebace- ous, thickish material in which numerous hairs are embedded. DISEASES OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES. Displacements of the Fallopian tubes, especially in a backward and downward direction, are often asso- ciated with bending, dragging, or obliteration of the

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 120 If the body of the uterus is the part chiefly affected, it is customary, iu describing the disease, to employ the term endometritis corporis, while that of endometri- tis cervicalis should be employed when the disease is confined mainly to the cervical portion. Both of these varieties of endometritis are often present, in a given case, at one and the same moment of time, and it also often happens that the disease passes from one form into the other. From an anatomical standpoint it is preferable to lay stress upon the distinction between the acute and the chronic forms of the disease. Acute Endometritis. The causes which often lead to the development of an acute endometritis are the following: the gono- cocci and certain pus exciting micro-organisms (strep- tococcus and staphylococcus) which are present either during the lying-in period—at which time the bac- teria of decomposition are often associated with them (ichorous puerperal endometritis)—or after certain operative procedures upon the uterus (septic endo- metritis of traumatic origin). Milder forms of acute endometritis (endometritis catarrhalis) are encoun- tered in the course of certain infectious diseases. The most important and the most dangerous form of this disease is— Puerperal Septic Endometritis. (Plate 16.) It may develop after labor at full term and also after a miscarriage—both with and without mechani- cal lesions. While hyperaemia and well-marked oedema are certainly predisposing factors, of greater

a certain amount of subacute trouble of more recent origin. It is not clear whether the genital tuberculosis noted in this case is to be considered as the primary disease or merely as a secondary development. In the latter case —which is the more likely of the two to be the correct one—it may be assumed that the infectious process spread from the mucous membrane of the colon to the lymph glands of the abdominal cavity, to the peritoneum, and thence to the Fallopian tubes and the mucous mem- brane of the uterus and vagina. (No. 383, 1895.) Explanation of Plate 19. Polypoid Fibroma of the Uterine Mucous Mem- brane (Mucous Polyp). In the cavity of the uterus, which is moderately en- larged, is a tumor about half the size of a hen’s egg. It grows from the upper and posterior wall. It is of a dark red color and soft consistence. Its surface is some- what knobbed, and it is attached by a broad base to the wall of the uterus. The patient, a woman forty-six years of age, died from tuberculosis of the lungs. (No. 387, 1895.)

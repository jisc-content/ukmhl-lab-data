ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 104 adeno-cystomata are of two varieties: the glandular and the papillary. These tumors, which have a smooth surface, are of a somewhat soft consistence, and when palpated they seem to fluctuate. When cut open these tumors afford escape to grayish and grayish-white masses of a glairy and tough mucus, often mixed with altered blood (the result of twist- ing of the peduncle). Substances resembling mucin (pseudo-mucin) are present in abundance in these masses. The surface of a section of the tumor made with the knife shows plainly the irregular, honey- comb-like construction, for it brings into view a num- ber of large and small cysts, placed side by side and communicating one with another at numerous points. Whereas the glandular tumors (Fig. 4) possess a smooth internal surface, and are characterized by the fact that new cysts are formed by the folding in and subsequent constriction (at the starting-point) of a portion of the epithelial layer, the papillary cyst- adenomata (Fig. 3) present, in the chambers of which they are composed, the phenomenon of an abundant new production of villous and papillary structures covered with cylindrical and ciliated epithelium. The papillary cystadenomata (cystoma proliferum papillare) often involve both sides. They are gener- ally located within the broad ligament, and their growth is quite slow. Mixed forms of tumors which have developed from multilocular cystadenomata are of frequent occur- rence. Thus, for example, a carcinoma sometimes develops in what was originally a cystadenoma. Cystadenomata involve both ovaries in only five per cent of all cases. In the majority of instances (sev-

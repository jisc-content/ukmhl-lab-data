68 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Abnormal Deposits. Uric-acid infarctions in the form of yellow, brick- red, or yellowisli-red bands in the papillae and pyra- mids are seen oftenest in newborn children who have been alive at birth (and only very exceptionally in children born dead). The same remarks are true of those cylindrical or at times gland-shaped masses, composed of the urate of ammonium, which are seen in the urinary canaliculi (Plate 9, Fig. b). In doubtful medico-legal cases the presence of a uric-acid infarc- tion—indicating, as it does, an abundant production of uric acid in the first few days of life—may be con- sidered as evidence in favor of the view that the in- fant was born alive. In the gouty kidney (nephritis arthritica) deposits of sodium urate are also some- times found, especially in the urinary canaliculi of the medullary substance. Calcareous deposits are now and then observed in the medullary substance (at the points of the papillae) as a phenomenon belonging to no particular disease, and also sometimes in the loop-shaped canaliculi in chronic nephritis. In this condition we are dealing either with a calcification of the tunica propria which has lost its epithelium, or with a deposit of the chalky material either in the calibre of the urinary canaliculi or inside the capsules of the glomeruli. Then, be- sides, acute chalky infiltrations of the kidney are sometimes observed in cases of corrosive-sublimate poisoning. (Plate 7.)

At a later stage, these growths assume a more distinctly yellow color, and show a tendency to undergo retro- grade changes, such as fatty and cheesy degenera- tion. The dura mater of the spinal cord may be diseased in a similar manner; but in the majority of cases of chronic syphilitic menincjo-myelitis the chief pathological alterations are found, not in the dura but rather in the soft membranes. New growths of the dura mater are of rather com- mon occurrence. They are represented by the fol- lowing varieties: osteoma, fibroma, fibro-sarcoma, sarcoma, and psammoma. As a rule, they grow slowly, and attain only a moderate size. Generally, they grow from the internal surface of the membrane toward the cranial cavity, and as they advance they destroy a corresponding portion of the cerebral cor- tex. In other cases—especially those of sarcoma and osteoid sarcoma—they break through the skull and grow in an outward direction. (Fig. 6.) Thrombosis of the Sinuses of the Brain. Thrombotic coagulations occur with special fre- quency in the large venous blood channels of the dura mater. As is the case with thrombi of other peri- pheral veins, those which develop in these channels are either harmless—as in autochthonous marasmic throm- bosis—or infectious, as when a septic endophlebitis is the cause of the localized coagulation of blood. An autochthonous sinus thrombosis is oftenest found in the superior lor^itudinal sinus, from which point, in a centrifugal direction, the coagulating process ex-

Explanation of Plate 51. Gouty Inflammation of the Knee-Joint; Gonar- THRITIS UrICA. In the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, which had been laid open, there were found whitish and bluish- white deposits of uric acid which looked like plaster of Paris. Similar deposits were also found in various other joints (polyarthritis urica). The pathological changes which, in this patient (a baker, forty-five years of age), led to a fatal issue, were the following: Granular atrophy (“gouty kidney”) of the right kidney, with congenital absence of the left kidney and corresponding ureter; lobular pneumonia on both sides, with commencing pleurisy; a high grade of general anaemia; and concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart. The patient, who, toward the end of his life, had become a drinker, acquired the gout in 1872 (twenty-two years before his death), as the re- sult—so he said—of the campaign of 1870-71. From that time onward he had had gouty attacks, almost every year, in the spring and autumn. In these attacks the joints of the hands and feet had always become swollen. No evidence of heredity could be discovered. (No. 289, 1894.)

Explanation of Plate 33. Red Softening of the Right Cerebral Hemisphere; Hemorrhagic Encephalo-Malacia (eighteen days old). In the vicinity of the left temporal lobe and island of Reil the brain substance felt very soft, even fluctuating, like a bladder filled with fluid. When this portion was cut into, by an incision which began at a point corre- sponding to the left centrum semiovale and extended from there down as far as the island and the cortex of the temporal lobe, a cavity as large as a child’s fist was exposed to view. This cavity was filled with a rust- colored, soft, greasy material, which consisted of broken-down brain substance, and throughout which numerous small collections of blood were scattered. The white brain substance in the neighborhood of the cavity was in an cedematous condition and lemon colored. Toward the median line the area of softening extended as far as to the ependyma of the left lateral ventricle, and included the thalamus opticus and the nucleus lenti- formis. The blood-vessels at the base of the brain showed no disease of their walls; the arteria pro fossa Sylvii, on the left side, was empty. In this patient—a woman fifty-four years of age, who, eighteen days previously, had had an apoplectic attack— the following pathological alterations were found in other parts of the body: Chronic endocarditis of all the valves of the heart, with the exception of those placed at the commencement of the pulmonary artery; recur- ring verrucose endocarditis of the mitral valve, with marked stenosis of the same; stenosis of the tricuspid valve, and the presence of a ball-shaped thrombus in the right auricle; multiple hemorrhagic infarctions in both

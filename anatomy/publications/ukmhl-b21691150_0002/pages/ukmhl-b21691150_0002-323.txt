THE BONES AND JOINTS. 205 Syphilis of Bone. Bone syphilis is characterized by the chronic course which it pursues. The periosteum is the part most often affected. In simple syphilitic periostitis— which localizes itself principally in the deepest layers of the periosteum, and is encountered especially on the skull and on the tibia—the periosteum first in- creases in thickness and then produces osteophytes or irregularly shaped nodular growths of bone tissue. In the gummous form of periostitis semisolid, almost fluctuating nodules are produced. Periosteal gum- mata like these may be entirely absorbed. In quite a number of cases the underlying bone may be worn away to a greater or less extent, or it may even be- come perforated (the so-called caries sicca). When the periostitis results in a breaking down of the tis- sues (suppurative periostitis), the inflammation may extend to the adjacent and superjacent soft parts. The discharge from such a focus of disease consists of a slimy, ropy mucus, mixed with blood and pus. The so-called cold abscess (with a tendency to bur- row) may also form under these circumstances. Fi- nally, the disease may end in caries and necrosis of the bone, and cicatricial tissue may form at the spot. The cicatrix of the overlying skin is generally drawn inward, by reason of its close connection with the bone cicatrix. The simple and gummous forms of periostitis find their counterparts in the simple and gummous forms of osteitis and osteomyelitis. The former of these displays a proliferative tendency, which leads to the

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 60 glomerulitis, associated with decided enlargement of the glomeruli, which are very rich in nuclei through the proliferation of the endothelium. The inter- stitial tissue is often markedly infiltrated with cellu- lar elements, as a result of which condition the struc- tural details do not stand out distinctly; the tissues look more like those of a sarcoma. When these alter- ations are found, it may be assumed that a diffuse interstitial inflammation has been engrafted upon the parenchymatous variety. Chronic Interstitial Nephritis. Indurative nephritis; granular contracted kidney; true contracted kidney; Bright’s disease; atrophic renal cirrhosis. (Plate 4.) This disease is characterized by an insidious begin- ning and a chronic course. The anatomical changes which accompany it are the following: The kidneys are markedly reduced in size, sometimes—in far-ad- vanced cases—even to one-third the normal size. The capsule is thickened and hard to separate from the kidney, small portions of the cortex often being found adhering to its inner surface after it has been removed. The organ itself presents a finely granular surface, of a waxy or whitish-gray color; the projecting gran- ules generally displaying an appreciably brighter shade of color than the surrounding tissue, which is somewhat cicatricial in character and consequently occupies a lower level. The kidney is so tough and hard that it cuts like a piece of India rubber. The surface of the section has a pale gray color, and nei- ther blood nor juices of any kind escape from it under pressure. The cortical zone is much narrowed, to

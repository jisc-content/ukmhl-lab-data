168 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. plexy, it lias been shown that in many cases—aside from the influence of a certain degree of inherited predisposition—it is mainly due to two factors, viz.: disease of the finer arteries (with or without the forma- tion of miliary aneurisms) and the persisting ino'ease in arterial pressure which is associated with hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart. The plethora result- ing from this increased arterial pressure also exerts a favoring influence. Among the diseases of the finer arteries may be mentioned fatty and hyaline degen- eration, atheromatosis, and syphilitic endarteritis. In many cases—particularly those in which no mili- ary aneurisms exist—it may be assumed that a pre- vious degeneration of the brain substance first brings on a sort of arterio-sclerotic, prehemorrhagic soften- ing, and that this in turn produces a local predisposi- tion to the occurrence of an apoplectic attack. Pre- vious injuries (concussion, for example) may also induce—particularly in the walls of the cerebral ven- tricles—some local pathological change or degenera- tion which favors a late apoplectic attach. This is particularly true in the case of children and young individuals. It is a very common experience to find a fatal apoplexy in a case of chronic nephritis (Bright’s disease), which, as is well known, is gen- erally associated with hypertrophy of the left ventri- cle of the heart. This renal form of apoplexy is encountered particularly often in men who are be- tween thirty and sixty years of age. Inasmuch as a cardiac hypertrophy which is not of renal origin predisposes in a much less marked manner to apo- plexy, we may assume that the kidney disease—pos- sibly through the intervention of the resulting hydree-

These latter abscesses, which are known as otitic brain abscesses, are located either in the temporal lobe or in the cerebellum. Brain abscesses may also develop by metastasis from disease of the lungs (putrid bronchitis, in cases of bronchiectatic cavities, empyema), or from a septic endocarditis of the left heart, in which disease multi- ple hemorrhagic foci also develop in the brain. Brain abscesses which originate in these ways may attain the size of a goose’s egg, and not infrequently—par- ticularly in septico-pvaemia—several of them may be present in the brain at the same time. In abscesses which have persisted for some time a sort of capsule develops around the collection of pus. If the ab- scess is situated near the surface of the brain, it may give rise to a secondary purulent leptomeningitis, the issue of which is likely to be fatal. In rare cases the pus of such an abscess has a foul odor and an ab- normal color—circumstances which are due to the penetration of bacteria of decomposition into the sub- stance of the brain (putrid abscess). Through the seemingly purulent softening of cheesy solitary tuber- cles a tuberculous brain abscess may develop. A •purulent and gangrenous inflammation of the brain is sometimes observed after a severe injury, which has caused a comminuted fracture of the skull and has laid bare the brain. It is also seen in cases of malignant new growths, which destroy the bony structures of the head and the membranes of the brain, and expose to view the cerebral cavity. (Plate 49.)

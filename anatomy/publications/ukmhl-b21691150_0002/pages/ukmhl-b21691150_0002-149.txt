Explanation of Plate 45. Arthritis Deformans. The lower epiphysis of the femur shows a high degree of deforming bone proliferation, the result of an ossify- ing hyperplasia of the articular cartilages, in the course of which the proliferative process has spread to the neighboring periosteum. Those portions of the bone which are contiguous to the articular surfaces are also covered with irregularly shaped osteophytesâ€”some with jagged outlines, others thorn-shaped. That portion of the bone which has been deprived of its covering of car- tilage is now covered with the products of a sclerosing osteitis.

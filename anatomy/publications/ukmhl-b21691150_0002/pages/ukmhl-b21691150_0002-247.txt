SEXUAL APPARATUS. 129 produces an exudation which is either watery (a cloudy serum), purulent, or—when it has lasted for a sufficient length of time—plastic in character, in the latter case developing into a connective tissue which tends to shrink and to form callosities (scleros- ing parametritis). Parametritic abscesses may also break through into adjacent organs (the intestine, for example). The acute exudative forms are generally septic in character, the result of puerperal infection, or else they develop in consequence of ulcerations or mechanical injuries of the vagina, of the vaginal por- tion of the uterus, of the cervix, or even of the rectum. New Growths op the Uterus. Myoma, Leiomyoma, Fibromyoma. (Plate 20.) The myoma, an extremely common homologous new growth of the uterus, is encountered in from ten to twelve per cent of all female cadavers, and most frequently (two-thirds of all the cases) in women be- tween the ages of thirty and fifty. Tumors of this nature consist of smooth muscular fibres and connec- tive tissue, and they vary greatly in size, some being no larger than a hempseed, while others attain the size of a man’s fist or even of his head. They have a rounded form (globular myoma), are separated from the surrounding tissues by sharply defined limits, and are often multiple in character. They have a somewhat whitish color, are very tough, and creak under the knife. The fundus uteri and the posterior portion of the body of this organ are the favorite

A venous hypersemia is observed when the return of the venous blood is hindered in some man- ner (as in death which originates at the heart, and in thrombosis of the large venous trunks). Anaemia of the Brain. In this condition the tissues of the brain have a pale hue, and when there is an entire absence of blood the white substance has a waxy white color. Very few bloody points are visible upon the surface of a section, or they may be altogether absent. The con- sistence of the brain is perhaps somewhat increased; but if oedema is present at the same time, it will be found somewhat diminished. Generally speaking, the diminished amount of blood in the brain is simply one of various phenomena indicative of a general acute or chronic anaemia (such as death from loss of blood, or some cachectic disease like tuberculosis, cancer, etc.). In other cases still, some local intracranial cause for the anaemia may be discovered; as, for ex- ample, a condition of hydrocephalus, a tumor, or a well-marked arterio-sclerosis. (Edema of the Brain. When the brain substance is abnormally saturated with serum it will be found to have an increased vol- ume, and its convolutions will appear flattened out. The consistence of the organ will also be found to be more or less diminishedâ€”in extreme cases, up to the point of actual softening (white softening); this latter condition being observed, for example, in the vicinity of the ventricles in hydrocephalus internus and in meningitis.

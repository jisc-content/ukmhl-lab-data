In the case of multiple intramural myomata the uterine walls are generally somewhat atrophied, owing to the fact that the larger part of the normal tissues of which they are com- posed has been destroyed by the advancing growth of the tumors. Carcinoma of the Uterus. (Plates 17 and 21.) Cancer of the uterus is one of the commonest forms of carcinoma (one-third of all cases of cancer in wo- men) . It first manifests itself during the climacteric years or near that period of life. The starting-point of the growth is most commonly the epithelium of the fjortio vaginalis of the uterus, less frequently that of the cervical mucous membrane, and the most rarely of all (between three and four per cent of all cases) the mucous membrane of the body of the uterus. The frequency with which cica- trices, inflammatory erosions, and other conditions of irritation are apt to be located in the neighborhood of the external orifice of the uterus explains why these parts show a local predisposition to the de- velopment of a carcinoma. The catarrhal affections of the cervix, which are of such frequent occurrence, are apt to lead to ectropium and to erosions. Cancer of the Lower Part of the Uterus (carcinoma of the portio vaginalis and neck of the uterus).—The following varieties are distinguished: superficial or flat cancer, characterized by a tendency to spread along the surface; penetrating or infiltrating cancer, which very rapidly extends to the submucous and

69 URINARY APPARATUS. globin, deposited in the urinary canaliculi of both the cortical and the medullary portions of the kidney, oc- cur in certain forms of poisoning (chloride of calcium, arseniuretted hydrogen; poisoning by one of the poi- sonous varieties of the Morchella fungus; transfusion of another person’s blood, etc.), and also in cases of severe burns. The associated hsemoglobinuria is ac- cordingly a symptom of a great variety of morbid processes. It also sometimes occurs in the form of a periodic or paroxysmal hsemoglobinuria, as a conse- quence of exposure to cold or of excessive muscular exertion. New Growths of the Kidney. They are not of rare occurrence. Cysts filled with serum or containing colloid, and representing reten- tion cysts, are often observed at post-mortem exami- nations. They rarely occur singly, and they vary in size from that of a pin’s head to that of a pea, or even some larger object. They generally occur in the course of a chronic interstitial inflammation, and in senile and arterio-sclerotic atrophy of the organ (acquired cystic kidney). As regards their mode of development, it may be said that they result from the obliteration of uriniferous canaliculi or from Mal- pighian bodies. Then, besides, one sometimes finds in a perfectly normal kidney a single large cyst—or even several of them—filled with a clear serous fluid and provided with a thin translucent capsule. (Plate 10, Fig a.) In some instances the cystic development predomi- nates to such a degree that only scanty remnants of kidney substance are left. When this condition of

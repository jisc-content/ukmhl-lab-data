Explanation of Plate 38. United Fracture of the Femur, as Seen from Two Sides. (After Helferich.) The different forms of dislocation of the fractured ends of the shaft are here combined. They are as follows: 1. The two broken fragments are displaced in such a manner that their ends do not stand facing each other, but lie side by side. This form is termed lateral dis- location—dislocatio ad latus (see Fig. a, in the plate). 2. The two fragments are not only dislocated laterally, but they are also displaced longitudinally in such a man- ner that the femur as a whole appears to be shortened; the fragments ride past each other. This form is termed longitudinal dislocation with contraction—dislocatio ad longitudinem cum contractione (see also Fig. a, in the plate). 3. The fragments do not lie side by side in parallel lines, but the respective axes of the two form somewhat of an angle with each other. This form is termed axial dislocation—dislocatio ad axin (see Fig. b, in the plate). 4. In this fourth form one further change is added to the three just described, viz., one of the fragments has undergone a certain amount of twisting around its long axis. In Fig. a the upper fragment is seen in a correct front view, while the lower fragment seems to be twisted very decidedly inward. This form is termed peripheral dislocation—dislocatio ad peripheriam.

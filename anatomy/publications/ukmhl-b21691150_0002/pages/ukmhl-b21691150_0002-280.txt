ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 162 Inflammatory conditions of irritation affecting the ependyma (chronic ependymitis, endomeningitis) and the plexus of veins, play an important part in these forms of hydrocephalus, the ependyma often being found in a thickened condition, and showing on its surface a network design and granulations like parti- cles of sand. In congenital hydrocephalus interims (Plates 26 and 27) an abundant quantity of clear serum is commonly found in the dilated, almost oval cerebral ventricles. The atrophic and imperfectly developed brain sub- stance surrounds these dilated cavities in much the same way as would a mantle. The optic thalami and the corpora striata are spread apart and flattened. The bony walls of the skull show corresponding changes. The cranium, for example, presents a spherical form, like that of a distended bladder; the individual bones of which it is composed are notice- ably thinned, and their edges are separated from one another by a broad space which is spanned by a membrane; the cranial sutures do not interlock, and the fontanelles are broadly open. It is often impos- sible to ascertain the cause of the disease; we simply know that syphilis in the parents confers a certain degree of predisposition upon the offspring. In many cases the cause is doubtless to be sought for in some disturbance in the development of the brain. When the predisposition at the time of birth is slight, and then during the first years of life it in- creases to such a degree as to induce a fatal termina- tion, we may speak of the case as one in which there is a combination of congenital and acquired hydro- cephalus. Now and then a case is seen in which

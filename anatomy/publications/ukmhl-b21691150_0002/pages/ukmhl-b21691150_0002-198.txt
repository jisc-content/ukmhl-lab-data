ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 80 epithelium. After the disease has gone on for a con- siderable length of time, difficulty will be experienced by the patient in voiding urine (retentio urinae), and as a later result both the mucous membrane and the muscular coat of the organ will undergo hypertrophy (chronic hypertrophy of the walls of the bladder). In the more severe forms of cystitis the exudation consists of pus alone. Here and there a spot may also be seon where a layer of fibrinous material ad- heres to the mucous membrane or where a partial destruction of the latter has taken place (Plate 13). When the necrosis penetrates more deeply, an actual perforation of the bladder may be established. The cast-off tissues, when the urine has undergone am- moniacal fermentation, present a grayish-white color, are filled with scattered concretions, and feel gritty when pressed between the fingers. In such forms of infectious and diphtheroid cystitis—forms in which the pathogenic micro-organisms bacterium coli and proteus play a part—the urine generally shows an acid reaction, and the inflammatory changes in the mucous membrane must be looked upon as the direct product of the action of bacteria. Processes which terminate in necrosis of the mucous membrane of the bladder are apt to develop when the urine undergoes ammoniacal decomposition, and the latter sets in when either a mixed infection of the urine takes place—as when proteus, diplococcus ureae, staphy- lococci, and the saprophytic micro-organisms are associated with bacterium coli—or when a pure infec- tion of this fluid with the diplococcus ureae is effected. Stagnation of the urine in the bladder plays an im- portant part in the causation of cystitis. The bac-

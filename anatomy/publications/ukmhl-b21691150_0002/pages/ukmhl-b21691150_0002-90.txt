Explanation of Plate 26. Congenital Hydrocephalus Internus. (Two-thirds natural size.) The lateral ventricles are very markedly dilated, and filled with a clear watery fluid. The ependyma is some- what opaque and thickened. (The dark coloring of the walls of the ventricles did not exist in the original prep- aration, from which the drawing was made; it is due to the fault of the artist, who made his shading too dark.) The secondary disappearance of the cerebral substance may be seen with special distinctness in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, while, on the other hand, the gray cortical matter appears to be less narrowed.

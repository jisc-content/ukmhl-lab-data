When death does not immediately follow such an apoplectic stroke, a variety of changes may be expected to take place in the affected brain area. In the first place, the focus diminishes in size as a result of the gradual absorp- tion of both the fluid and the solid portions of the apoplexy. When the latter have been converted into a fatty, emulsion-like fluid, numerous granule cells (phagocytes laden with fat) make their appearance. The coloring-matter of the blood also undergoes cer- tain changes, and the red blood corpuscles become swollen, lose their color, and shrink. From the sixth day onward, owing to the instability of the iron in the haemoglobin, diffuse hsemosiderin will be found to be present, and this in turn speedily becomes con- verted into granules. In the course of the third week free pigment appears for the first time. After the splitting off of the iron, haemotoidin will be developed (in the course of the seventh week); and this will be found in a free state, both in crystalline form and as amorphous masses. The apoplectic cicatrix, which has developed in the manner described, presents an ochre-yellow or a rusty color. If the apoplectic focus occupies a position at the surface of the brain, a scar- like defect will remain as a permanent lesion. On the other hand, if the focus be situated in the interior of the brain, a cyst with rust-colored walls will be the ultimate result of the apoplexy. As regards the causes of spontaneous cerebral apo-

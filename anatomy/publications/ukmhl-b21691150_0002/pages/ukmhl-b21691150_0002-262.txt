ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 144 face presents a glistening moist appearance and a uniform grayish-white color. Fatty degeneration may be seen in a few portions of the tumor, and now and then softening, necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic formations may be encountered at different points in the mass. Adeno-cysto-sarcoma (cysto-sarcoma phyllodes pro- liferum or intracanaliculare) should be considered as a special variety of sarcoma, in which the newly formed tumor masses, covered with epithelium, grow like polypi or like leaves into the dilated lacteal ducts, which are also lined with small pavement epi- thelium. In this manner a tumor is developed, in which there are numerous irregularly shaped, cleft- like spaces; and when this lobulated tumor is laid open by an incision the cut surface presents very much the same appearance as does that of a head of cabbage, in which there are numerous layers of leaves. This adeno-sarcoma, which has usually a hemispheri- cal shape, sometimes grows quite rapidly, and may attain a considerable size. Its malignity is mainly of a local character, showing itself in a tendency to involve neighboring organs. Ulceration sets in only at an advanced stage of the growth. Metastases to lymph glands and internal organs have not been observed. Epithelial Tumors of the Mammary Gland. Adenoma of the mammary gland is rarely encoun- tered as a diffuse tumor involving both breasts. It occurs more frequently in the form of a circumscribed nodular tumor. It is a very common experience to find it in combination with one of the varieties of

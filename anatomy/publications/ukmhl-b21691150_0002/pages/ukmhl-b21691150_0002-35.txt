Explanation of Plate 7. Acute Toxic Parenchymatous Nephritis, in a Case of Bichloride-of-Mercury Poisoning. The kidney, taken from a girl nine years old, is greatly enlarged; the capsule is easily removable; the surface of the organ is smooth; its tissues are soft and easily friable. The cortical substance is much broader than normal and of a pale grayish-white color; the normal markings, as seen on the cut surface, are indistinct, as if they had been washed out. The pyramids are of a dark bluish-red color, and somewhat swollen. The following changes are recognizable under the microscope: Cloudy swelling of the epithelial cells, partial necrosis of these elements, and calcareous infarctions. Three and a half days before her death the patient, while in an excited condition, had swallowed a bichloride tablet (1 gm.). Her intention, it was believed, was to commit suicide. The greater part of the poison was soon ejected from the stomach. Complete anuria. At the post-mortem examination there was found, in addi- tion to the marked nephritis, a catarrhal inflammation of the intestines of moderate severity. The mucous mem- brane of the stomach was seemingly not affected. Sub- pleural ecchymoses over both lungs and hypostatic hy- persemia of the lower lobes. (No. 297, 1894.) (This case of intestinal bichloride-of-mercury poison- ing is described in greater detail in the dissertation of Ralph Dtirig, entitled “ Ueber einen Fall von intestinaler Sublimat-Intoxikation, ” Munich, 1896.)

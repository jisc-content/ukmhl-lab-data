107 SEXUAL APPARATUS. Hemorrhage from the Mucous Membrane of the Fallopian Tubes. This may result from a variety of causes, such as menstruation, inflammatory processes, and infectious diseases. The blood which is thus poured out may escape into the abdominal cavity and there form a retro-uterine hcemcitocele. But if the abdominal ori- fice is obliterated the escaping blood will accumulate in the lumen of the tube, thus causing it to become dilated. To this condition, which, when seen from without, presents the same appearances as does a hydrosalpinx, the name hcemato-salpinx, or Jicematoma of the Fallopian tube, is given. Finally, a hsemato- salpinx may be the result of a gynatresia (atresia of the cervix or of the vagina), and with this condition a hsematometra will be associated. In tubal pregnancy a hemorrhage, which is often fatal, may be expected to occur when the sac ruptures. Inflammation of the Fallopian Tubes ; Salpingitis. Inflammation of the tubal mucous membrane may occur in either an acute or a chronic form. As a rule the inflammatory and infectious process travels in a directly continuous manner from the mucous mem- brane of the uterus. The milder forms are termed tubal catarrh (salpin- gitis catarrhalis, in which disease the pathological changes are those of a mild inflammation of the mu- cous membrane, accompanied by a muco-serous secre- tion. Through an extension of the disease to the

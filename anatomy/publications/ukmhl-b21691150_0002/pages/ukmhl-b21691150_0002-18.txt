Explanation of Plate 2. Embolic, Anaemic, and Necrotic Infarctions of the Kidney. The substance of the kidney is almost entirely con- verted into opaque yellowish masses, which in some places (in the lower part of the picture, for example) completely replace the cortical and the medullary sub- stances, while in other places they occur in the form of isolated wedges. The margins of the organ show a slightly reddish hue. Embedded in the fat at the hilus may be seen transverse and oblique sections of the pathogenic emboli which plug the arterial branches. Elsewhere throughout the kidney—although these lesions do not appear in the colored plate—may be seen a num- ber of spots where cicatricial contractions (the remains of earlier embolic processes which have run their course, have healed, and have then undergone absorption) have taken place. At the post-mortem examination marasmic thrombi were found in the left auricle of the heart, and thrombi were also found attached to the inner wall of the thoracic aorta, particularly in the vicinity of the arch; both of which lesions are to be considered as the products of embolic plugs that have found their way into the general circulation after passing through that of the kidney. The inner coat of the aorta was found to pre- sent alterations to which the term calcareous and ulcerous endarteritis is usually applied. Among the other pathological changes observed in this patient (aged fifty-nine) were the following: Marked hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart, which weighed 490 gm., or 190 gm. in excess of the normal weight (death, it should be stated, was due to heart failure); anaemic infarction of the spleen; terminal sero-fibriuoui pleuritis and hydrothorax (hydrothorax inflammatorius) involving both sides of the chest; and a moderate degree of general dropsy.

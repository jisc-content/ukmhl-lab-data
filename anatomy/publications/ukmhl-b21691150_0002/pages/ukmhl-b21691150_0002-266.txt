Nervous Apparatus. DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. DISEASES OF THE DURA MATER. Inflammatory processes involving the dura mater (pachymeningitis) are either benign in character or of infectious origin. According as the inflammation is localized upon the inner or upon the outer surface of the dura, it is customary to speak of it as a pachymeningitis interna or a pachymeningitis ex- terna. A very common form of the disease is that which bears the name of chronic adhesive and fibrous 'pachy- meningitis. In this form the dura will be found to be more or less firmly adherent to the inner table of the skull, thickened (through increase of the connective tissue), and opaque. In the higher degrees of the disease this membrane feels stiff and tough like leather. In its character of bone periosteum this membrane, when inflamed, often produces thicken- ing and hyperostosis of the skull capâ€”pachymen- ingitis ossificans. This form of periostitis occurs especially in old age, as an accompaniment of cir- culatory disturbances, chronic alcoholism, psychoses, etc.

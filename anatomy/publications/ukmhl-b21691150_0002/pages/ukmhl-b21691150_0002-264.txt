ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 146 doubtless showing evidences of fatty degeneration. When the stroma is only scantily developed, while at the same time the epithelial elements predominate, the tumor will present a marrow-like consistence {carcinoma medullare, medullary cancer). On the other hand, when the stroma is powerfully developed the cancer will be of the hard variety {carcinoma fibro- sum, scirrhus, atrophying cancer). This last form of cancer (ten per cent of all cancers of the breast) creaks when cut with the knife, and very little juice can be obtained from the cut surface. The gelatinous or colloid cancer (carcinoma gela- tinosum) is rarely seen in the mammary gland. Cancer of the breast shows a disposition to involve, at a very early stage, the overlying skin. The tis- sues are apt to break down at this point, and then there remains a crater-like ulceration. In scirrhus, on the other hand, there is a tendency to shrinking, as a result of which there is apt to be a cicatricial drawing in of the surface of the skin. Then, besides, the carcinoma is likely to involve the neighboring muscular tissue and the pleura, either by a continu- ous extension of the growth or in a disconnected man- nerâ€” i.e., with normal tissues lying between the sepa- rate areas of tumor growth. In a very short time a metastatic transfer of cancer elements to the glands of the axilla takes place. It is indeed only in rare cases that these glands escape. Cancer of the breast occurs most frequently in wo- men who are between forty-one and fifty-five years of age, and it is encountered comparatively seldom be- fore the thirtieth and after the fifty-fifth year of life. Cancer occurs more frequently in women who bear

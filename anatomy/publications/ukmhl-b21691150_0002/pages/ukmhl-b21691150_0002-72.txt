Explanation of Plate 20. Multiple Myoma of the Uterus, and Hydrosal- pinx on the Left Side. In the walls of the uterus there is quite a large num- ber of myomata, varying in size from that of a pea to that of a walnut. While a few of them are located deep down in the muscular layer, the majority lie near the surface, just beneath the serous covering. The tissues covering the fundus and body of the uterus have, for the most part, been obliterated by the tumors, but the cervical portion of the organ (which has been laid open by a longitudinal incision) is still fairly well preserved. The grayish translucent sac, which lies to the left of the disfigured uterus, and whose walls display a somewhat rich development of blood-vessels, is nothing more or less than the enormously dilated left Fallopian tube, which is filled with a serous fluid (hydrosalpinx), and whose orifices have been obliterated.

SEXUAL APPARATUS. 101 from an adeno-cystoma of tlie ovary, and we may then term it a cystoma carcinomatosum or an adeno-cysto- carcinoma. The papillary epithelioma (the papilloma of free surfaces) is also rarely encountered in the ovary. It consists of projecting villous growths, rich in blood-vessels and covered with an abundance of cylin- drical epithelium. The cystic tumors of the ovaries are seen in three different forms, viz., as simple follicular cysts, as multilocular cystomata or cystadenomata, and as dermoid cysts. 1. Simple follicular cysts (hydrops follicularis, dropsy of the Graafian follicles). In the early stages of the disease it is often still possible to discover the ovum. These cysts are either multiple or they may occur singly. As a rule they possess only one chamber. Their first de- velopment usually takes place at the age of sexual maturity. In the matter of size they differ greatly, some being no larger than the head of a pin, while JS'0^J27“i° ‘lel!e“^‘t,” others may attain the size of a man’s head. On their inner surface these cysts are smooth, being lined with a single layer of cylin- drical or flattened epithelium. The fluid contained within them is generally a clear serum, but now and then there may be an admixture of altered blood. Fig. 2.—Multiple Cysts of the

152 ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. upon the outer surface of the dura, at the base and toward the front part of the cranial cavity; and gen- erally with this process is associated an analogous Fig. 6.—Spindle-Cell Sarcoma of the Dura Mater. In this patient, a boy nineteen years old, there had been growing slowly, for a period of two years previous to the time when he came under observation, a moder- ately hard, elastic tumor, which projected symmetrically above his fore- head and over both temples. This tumor, which is somewhat pointed in front and rises upward somewhat like a helmet, is covered with a tensely stretched skin and is immovably attached to the underlying bone. Oper- ative removal of the growth, followed by death at the end of four days. At the post-mortem examination it was found that the tumor sprang from the outer surface of the dura mater, had grown diffusely through the overlying bone, and had pushed its way up under the skin in the manner shown in the accompanying cut. A portion of the tumor, about the size of a hen’s egg, had grown downward into the cranial cavity, where it occupied a certain amount of space on both sides of the falx, and of course made an impression of corresponding depth upon the cere- bral hemispheres. A laminated thrombus was found in the longitudinal sinus.

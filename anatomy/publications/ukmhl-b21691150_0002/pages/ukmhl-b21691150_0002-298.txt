180 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Tlie psammomata which originate in the plexuses of veins and the soft membranes of the brain are in reality fibro-sarcomata, i.e., slowly growing tumors, in which are embedded concentrically laminated chalky bodies that have both the outward likeness and the physical properties of brain sand, as it is encountered in the normal plexuses of veins and in the pineal gland. Tumors of the brain lead to wear- ing away and destruction of brain substance, to cir- culatory disturbances, to hydrocephalus internus, and to an increase of the intracranial pressure. Tumors of tlie spinal cord and of its membranes come only rarely under observation, either as meta- static (in the case of carcinoma and sarcoma) or as primary growths. The latter, so far as their general features and structure are concerned, are similar to the tumors of the brain. The varieties most often encountered are the glioma, the sarcoma, and the glio-sarcoma. The location of these tumors is either in the substance of the spinal cord (intramedullary growths) or in its membranous envelopes (meningeal tumors, either intradural or extradural in their loca- tion) . Such tumors either grow around the cord like a circular band, or they have a spherical shape; or, finally, the pia is infiltrated throughout its entire length by the tumor elements, so that the growth en- velops the cord like a mantle. Tumors of this sort rarely spread from the pia to the spinal cord. When they grow beyond the size of a cherry or a hazelnut, they are likely to cause grave disturbances, such as atrophy of the cord due to compression, or its conver- sion into a flat band, or, finally, the so-called compres- sion myelitis, with softening of the substance of the

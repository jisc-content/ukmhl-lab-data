SEXUAL APPARATUS. 115 ternum. In these cases a very narrow opening may be seen at the end of the hypertrophied, tough, and usually somewhat pointed or cone-shaped portio vagi- nalis of the uterus. Acquired stenosis and atresia of both the os inter- num and the os externum occur now and then as a result of some traumatism produced during labor or in consequence of an inflammation which has devel- oped during the puerperal period. The condition may also result from the presence of a flexion or a new growth. In women who have never borne chil- dren, stenosis and atresia may result from a growing together of opposite mucous surfaces which are to a greater or less extent eroded, or from an obliteration of the cervical canal through the growth of cicatricial tissue which has followed the employment of cauteri- zation. Among the results of such narrowing or closure may be enumerated the following symptoms: discomfort or actual pain (dysmenorrlioea) during menstruation, and retention of the menstrual blood (hsematometra, hsematosalpinx), and, in older women, the accumulation of a sero-mucous secretion (hydro- metra) or of one which is purulent in character (pyo- metra), the latter condition developing in the course of some inflammatory process of an infectious nature. Hemorrhage from the Uterus. A distinction must be made between hemorrhages which take place into the cavity of the uterus and those which occur outside in its immediate vi- cinity. Hemorrhages of the non-pregnant uterus are con-

93 SEXUAL APPARATUS. Among the new growths which are sometimes seen in the scrotum, the following may be mentioned: Lipo- mata and quite rarely carcinomata, particularly those remarkable (etiologically) and instructive cancers known as the tar and paraffin workers’ and chimney sweepers’ cancers. (Plate 14.) DISEASES OF THE SPERMATIC CORD AND THE TUNICA VAGINALIS PROPRIA. Inflammation of the spermatic ducts (funiculitis) may be excited by various causes. In rare cases an injury may be the cause of the trouble, and in that event an acute inflammation of the epididymis will scarcely fail to be an accompaniment. At first the parts are simply swollen and thickened, but later there may be suppuration and an abscess may form. In chronic (particularly syphilitic) orchitis and epididymitis the disease may also spread to the spermatic ducts, and as a result of this the connective-tissue walls of these channels and the tissues which envelop them undergo induration; and this in turn leads to closure (atresia) of the ducts. By the term hydrocele is understood an accumula- tion of a watery fluid in the sac of the tunica vagi- nalis propria testis. This fluid is generally clear, but sometimes there is an admixture of blood, and the color may then be that of chocolate (hcematocele). The term congenital hydrocele (h. congenita) is applied to that species of hydrocele in which the sac formed by the extension of the peritoneum down into the scrotum continues to remain open after birth. Ac- quired hydrocele (h. acquisita) is the commoner form

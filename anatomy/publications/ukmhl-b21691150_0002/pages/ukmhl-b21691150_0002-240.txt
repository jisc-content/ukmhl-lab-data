122 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. the course of the larger lymph channels, giving rise to puerperal metrolymphangitis, in which disease the lymph vessels which run alongside the cervix, where the broad ligaments are attached, are filled with pus. In still other cases the connecting link between the local infection and the secondary septico-pysemia is furnished by infectious thrombi which are con- tained in the veins of the uterine walls (the result of puerperal metrophlebitis) and which send extensions into the pampiniform plexus of veins and into the internal spermatic vein. Among the secondary proc- esses there remains to be mentioned purulent perito- nitis. This often develops quite rapidly from a septic endometritis, the micro-organisms which cause the infection reaching the peritoneum from the mucous membrane of the uterus either by way of the larger lymph channels-- which are also at the same time in- flamed and filled with pusâ€”or (more rarely) by direct continuity along the Fallopian tubes (puerperal sal- pingitis), or finally by some direct route (not macro- scopically demonstrable) from the internal surface of the uterus to the peritoneum. In the latter event it is possible, and especially if antiseptic irrigations of the cavity of the uterus have been carried out, for the primary process in the mucous membrane of the uterus to run its course almost without leaving a trace behind; and when this happens, therefore, nothing will be found at the post-mortem examina- tion beyond the secondary purulent peritonitis. In the majority of cases we may be sure that we are dealing with a geuuine septic infection due to the penetration of pathogenic germs (streptococci) into the tissues, while in the minority there may be a

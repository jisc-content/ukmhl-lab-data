SEXUAL APPARATUS. 113 The falling down (or prolapse) of the uterus is said to be incomplete when the lower part of the organ can be seen lying between the vulvae. The condition can be termed a complete prolapse when the entire uterus lies like a tumor in front of the vaginal opening, in which condition the everted vaginal wall covers the prolapsed organ. The prolapsed uterus is generally much enlarged, especially in its lower segment, and at the same time it is markedly engorged with blood by reason of in- terference with its venous circulation. The vaginal mucous membrane which covers the organ is invari- ably thickened, and the outer layer of epithelium is converted into something closely resembling an epi- dermis. The cavity of the uterus seems to be en- larged, and its lining mucous membrane is decidedly hypersemic. Among the secondary results may be mentioned decided stretching of the urinary bladder and a diverticulum-like protrusion of both it and the rectum (cystocele and rectocele). The orifice of the urethra is usually visible on the anterior aspect of the prolapsed parts. Among the secondary results of such a prolapse may be mentioned retention of urine, catarrh of the bladder, and a tendency to the formation of calculi. When the parts are examined from behind (i.e., through an opening in the abdomi- nal walls) there will be seen, between the bladder and the rectum, a funnel-shaped depression into which the ovaries and tubes have been pulled from above down- ward. Various factors play a part in the development of prolapse of the uterus, and of these the most impor- tant are the two following: a relaxed condition of the pelvic viscera, by reason of too frequent pregnancies,

NERVOUS APPARATUS. 181 cord at the affected points and an extension of this de- structive metamorphosis both upward and downward. The parasites which are occasionally found in the membranes of the brain and spinal cord are the fol- lowing : the cysticercus cellulosse, either only a few scattered individuals or large numbers of them; the echinococcus—very rarely; and, even more rarely, the actinomyces fungous growth, which may reach these parts either by aid of a metastatic process or by the route of continuous advancement. The latter parasitic growth appears very rarely, as a primary manifestation, in the ventricles of the brain; and, when it does so, it gives rise to the development of a myxomatous tumor. Hemorrhages in and Injuries of the Spinal Cord. The spontaneous escape of blood into the substance of the spinal cord—in a manner analogous to what takes place in cerebral apoplexy—is something which practically never occurs. The arrangement and sit- uation of the arteries in this region serve to pro- tect them against the high pressure and the resulting alterations (degenerations, dilatation, and rupture) which, in the case of the brain, constitute the ana- tomical groundwork of a spontaneous hemorrhage. Capillary apoplexies in the spinal cord, with second- ary softening, are observed in the course of certain forms of poisoning (phosphorus, arsenic). They are also observed in cases of embolic plugging of the smallest blood-vessels; and here, too, the apoplexies are situated in the gray matter of the cord, in the vicinity of the central canal.

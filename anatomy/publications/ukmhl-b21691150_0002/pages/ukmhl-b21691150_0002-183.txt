65 URINARY APPARATUS. —a disease which as a rule manifests this peculiarity, viz., that the tubercles first invade the prostate and then the remaining parts in the following order: tes- ticles, urinary bladder, ureters, pelvis of the kidney, and finally the parenchyma itself. It is only in rare cases that the kidney is the organ first affected. When this happens the process begins at the base of the pyramids, extends to the papillae, and then in turn involves—in a downward direction—the pelvis, the ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. In such a case it will be found that there are fewer tubercles in the bladder than in the kidney—a cir- cumstance which, in any case of genito-urinary tuber- culosis, may be taken as proof of a downward course in the advance of the disease. In renal phthisis the kidneys are generally enlarged, and the capsules ad- herent. When the organ is laid open by a cut with the knife, it will be found that only a narrow remnant of kidney substance still remains underneath the cap- sule. The pelvis, which is somewhat distended, con- tains purulent and cheesy products of a retrograde metamorphosis. In fact, it is a regular cavern, whose walls are composed of friable, yellowish-white, cheesy masses, scarcely any traces remaining of the papillae and medullary substance. The ureters are converted into tough and rigid cords, with much narrowed lu- mina; and the mucous membrane lining the latter is in some places merely thickened, while in others it is converted into fissured, friable masses of necrotic and cheesy-degenerated tissue. Besides pus and cheesy products tubercle bacilli are apt to be found in the urine, but they are sometimes entirely lacking. (Plate 12.)

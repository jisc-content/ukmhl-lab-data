Explanation of Plate 42. Lymphoid Hyperplasia of the Bone Marrow in a Case of Splenic, Lymphatic, and Myelogenous Pseudo-Leukaemia. The medullary cavity of the femur is filled with a partly bright red and partly dark red marrow, which looks like strawberry jam. In consequence of hyper- plasia of its cellular elements, the originally whitish- yellow and fatty marrow has here been converted into a mass of reddish lymphoid tissue. The patient from whom this specimen was taken, and who died of a profound anaemia, was thirty-two years of age and gracefully built. At the post-mortem examina- tion various other pathological conditions were found, as, for example: Enormous enlargement of the spleen; lymphoid hyperplasia of the intrathoracic and retroperi- toneal lymph glands; a high degree of general anaemia; a terminal sero-fibrinous pleuritis on the right side; and bronchi ectasiae in the upper lobe of the right lung.

Explanation of Plate 21. Carcinoma of the Cervix Uteri, with Beginning Involvement of the Vagina and Posterior Wall of the Bladder. (Two-thirds Datura] size.) The cervical portion of the uterus is, throughout its entire extent, infiltrated with cancer elements; these cancerous portions being distinguished from the healthy tissues by their opaque-yellowish and whitish color and by their diminished consistence. Below and toward the front the cancerous infiltration is advancing into the vault of the vagina and into its anterior wall, from which region, in turn, it is encroaching upon the posterior wall of the bladder. The subperitoneal connective tissue in the vicinity of the vagina and bladder, and the continua- tion of this downward as far as to the vulva, are also full of disseminated cancer masses.

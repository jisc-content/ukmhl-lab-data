135 SEXUAL APPARATUS. Sarcoma of the Uterus. Sarcoma of the uterus—either the round or the spindle cell variety—is, in comparison with carci- noma of this organ, observed only rarely. It occurs either in the form of a circumscribed growth or as a diffuse infiltration. It is usually located in the body or in the fundus of the uterus, more rarely in the cervical portion; in which location, according to re- cent accounts, endotheliomata have been seen. The starting-point of the growth is generally the mucous membrane or the submucosa, and only rarely the muscular layer and the subserosa. Occasionally a combination of sarcoma and myoma comes under observation. ISEASES OF THE VAGINA AND VULVA. Changes in the position of the vagina and vulva are sometimes seen, commonly in connection with dislo- cations of the uterus. These are prolapse of the anterior wall of the vagina (or vaginal cystocele) and prolapse of the posterior wall (or vaginal rectocele). In these conditions, as in the case of prolapse of the uterus, the mucous membrane of the vagina under- goes an epidermoidal thickening (pachydermia). Inflammation of the vagina (colpitis, vaginitis) oc- curs both during the lying-in period and indepen- dently of this state. Acute colpitis (vaginal catarrh) is often of gonor- rhoeal origin; it also may develop in consequence of some irritation of a mechanical, thermic, or chemical nature; and it sometimes results from the presence

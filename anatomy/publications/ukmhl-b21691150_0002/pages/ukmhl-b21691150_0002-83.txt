Explanation of Piate 23. Adhesive Pelveo - Peritonitis, Peri - Oophoritis, Perisalfingitis, and Pyosalpinx on the Right Side. (After Schaeffer.) Douglasâ€™ space seen from behind and above. Numer- ous pseudo-membranes, in the form of bands and more delicate cobweb-like threads, connect the posterior sur- face of the uterus with the neighboring organs, viz., the Fallopian tubes, the ovaries, and the sigmoid flexure of the large intestine, a segment of which may be seen in the picture. The left Fallopian tube is bent at several points; the outer surface of the right tube is inflamed and red, and its internal surface is in a condition of purulent inflammation. By reason of this and of the closure of the abdominal orifice, this tube is converted into a pyosalpinx, which is subdivided into well-rounded sections.

Explanation of Plate 36. Primary, Multiple, Chronic Tuberculous Disease of the Eight Cerebellum. The convolutions of the cerebrum were found to be flattened and the furrows obliterated. Irregularly shaped, tough, cheesy, opaque-yellow nodules were dis- seminated throughout the greater part of the right cere- bellum; and in the immediate neighborhood of these nodules the brain substance appeared to be somewhat softened and of a grayish-red color. The tuberculous nature of the tumor-like foci was established both by the aid of the microscope and by bacteriological methods. All the ventricles of the brain were very much dilated and filled with a watery fluid (hydrocephalus internus chronicus). The ependyma was found to be somewhat macerated. In this patient—a man forty-six years of age—the following lesions were found in other parts of the body: Emphysema of the lungs and hypereemia of the abdom- inal viscera. No trace of tuberculous disease was found anywhere in the body outside of the cerebellum. (No. 319, 1895.)

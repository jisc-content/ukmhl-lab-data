Explanation of Plate 46. Tuberculous Caries and Necrosis oe a Lumbar Vertebra. The body of the vertebra, and particularly the lower half, is in great measure destroyed. The portions of bone which were affected by the purulent and cheesy in- flammation (tuberculous osteomyelitis) and the necrosis, but were not destroyed, are easily friable and present an uneven and spongy looking surface. The spinous proc- ess and one of the transverse processes also show traces of having been attacked by the disease and of having undergone some softening. The secondary angular bend- ing of the lower part of the spinal column in a forward direction has already begun to show itself. (Prepara- tion belongs to the Pathological Institute.)

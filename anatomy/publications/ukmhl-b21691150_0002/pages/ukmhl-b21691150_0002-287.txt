NERVOUS APPARATUS. 169 mia—exerts a specially unfavorable influence upon the cerebral arteries. Whereas in advanced life arterio-sclerosis - generally in combination with hy- pertrophy of the heart—plays the leading part in the pathogenesis of spontaneous cerebral apoplexy, in younger persons (from twenty-five to fifty years of age) the main influences in bringing on a hemorrhage of the brain are, in addition to nephritis, syphilis, alcoholism, certain infectious diseases (typhoid fe- ver, small-pox, pyaemia, tuberculosis), and, finally, abnormities in the blood-making powers (such as pernicious anaemia, scurvy, leukaemia). Softening of the Brain; Encephalo-Malacia. This pathological change, in the great majority of cases, is of vascular origin; it develops in connection with thrombosis and embolism of the arteries,..and with obliterating endarteritis (arterio-sclerosis). The so-called white softening is most often encoun- tered, in the form of separate foci, in that part of the brain which is supplied by the arteria pro fossa Sylvii (oftener on the left side than on the right), after embolism of this artery has taken place, partic- ularly in the vicinity of the island of Beil and near the capsula interna. The emboli emanate from throm- botic and inflammatory processes involving the left side of the heart, the ascending aorta, and, more rarely, the pulmonary veins (those portions which are near the point where they enter the left auricle). In that portion of the brain which is suddenly cut off from its arterial blood supply, the following series of changes takes place: ischaemic necrosis; rapid break-

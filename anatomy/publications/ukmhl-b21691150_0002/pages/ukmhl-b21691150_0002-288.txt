ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 170 ing down, softening, and melting of the tissue ele- ments ; and the accumulation, in the area involved, of wandering cells, which, by aid of the process known as phagocytosis, have filled themselves full of a finely granular fat—the principal product resulting from the disintegration of the necrotic brain substance. (Cells in this condition are known as granule cells.) The brain substance, which at first was simply oedem- atously infiltrated, will now be found in a half-soft- ened state, almost fluctuating. This softened portion, which may reach the size of a hen’s or a goose’s egg, has no sharply defined limits; and very soon it is quite sure to melt down into a fluid resembling pap or imperfectly coagulated milk. Under favorable cir- cumstances, if death do not in the mean time put an end to the disease, the fatty aud necrotic products of the disintegration of the brain substance undergo complete absorption and there remains only a cyst, which is filled with a serous fluid, and whose walls are lined with a delicate membrane of connective tis- sue. Several such old apoplectic foci and cicatrices are often found in the same brain—a fact which is easily explained when we remember that such proc- esses as embolism, thrombosis, and obliterating endarteritis are constantly recurring; and these, of course, must create, over and over again, some new local disturbance. Inflammation of the Brain; Abscess. Abscesses of the brain are, on the whole, of rare occurrence. They may develop in consequence of an injury of the skull or through an extension of the dis-

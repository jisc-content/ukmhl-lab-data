203 THE BONES AND JOINTS. the bones of the upper extremities are involved in a little more than one-fifth (twenty-two per cent) of the cases. Tuberculous osteitis and osteomyelitis begin most often in the epiphysis of a tubular bone. As a result of the tuberculous infection there is developed a gran- ulating and rarefying inflammation, which causes the bone substance to break down and melt away. The granulation tissue, which contains miliary tubercles, giant cells, and tubercle bacilli, destroys by erosion the bone trabeculae, and at the same time it manifests a tendency to undergo itself cheesy necrosis. This granulating and cheesy inflammation quickly leads to extensive destructions of bone tissue, and these larger and smaller foci in which the bone has been destroyed show a tendency to break through to the surface (as into the cavity of a joint or out toward the periosteal covering of the bone). In the interior of these cavity-like defects in the bone, pus and cheesy material, more or less intermingled with spongy se- questra, are found; and the walls of these excavations are lined in many places with granulations mingled with pus and cheesy material. The periostitis which develops secondarily, at a later stage of the disease, leads to the accumulation of cheesy and purulent matter, and often to the for- mation of an abscess (the so-called burrowing ab- scess), particularly on the anterior surface of the body of a vertebra. Necrosis usually follows after the bone is deprived of its periosteum, or else fistu- lous channels form in the soft parts and carry pus from the surface of the bone out upon the surface of the skin.

PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. Urinary Apparatus. DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS. CIRCULATORY DISTURBANCES. Venous Hyperemia oe the Kidneys. (Passive Congestion of the Kidneys. Plate 1.) This condition may develop in connection with any one of a number of disturbances of the circulation, such as diminution of the power of the heart, idio- pathic hypertrophy of this organ, valvular defects, and pulmonary affections (emphysema, for ex- ample) . In acute hypercemia the kidneys will be found to be enlarged, highly congested and succulent, and col- ored a dark bluish-red. In venous hypercemia of long standing the kidneys are enlarged, and they present a dark bluish-red col- oration, especially in the region of the medullary substance. At the same time they will be found to possess a firmer consistence than usual (cyanotic induration). When the hypersemia lasts for years the cyanotic and indurated kidney (Plate 1) grad- ually undergoes atrophy. Not only does the connec-

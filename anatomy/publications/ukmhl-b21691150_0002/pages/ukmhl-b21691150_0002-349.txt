231 THE BONES AND JOINTS. whereas in the smaller ones there may be no evidences whatever of any exudation (arthritis sicca). This form of articular inflammation occurs particularly in advanced life (malum senile), and oftener in women than in men; or it may develop as a result of some mechanical injury or of some disturbance of the nutrition (unfavorable hygienic environment, partic- ularly in persons belonging to the poorer classes); or, finally, it may result from some unknown cause. The articular affections which occur in connection with tabes dorsalis follow very much the same course as do those which are observed in arthritis deformans. Affections which are of a somewhat mild type and which involve several joints at the same time, are of frequent occurrence in tabes. Loose or Movable Bodies in a Joint. The osteal and osteochondral bodies which are found free in the cavity of a joint owe their origin either to arthritis deformans or to some mechanical injury which has caused the detachment of a portion of the articular surface. The movable bodies of trau- matic origin consist of normal, living, articular car- tilage, with a somewhat jagged surface (where the separation occurred) which is covered with connective tissue and cartilage. These portions which have be- come separated from the articular surface do not re- main permanently free in the cavity of the joint, but soon form adhesions at some new point, and then undergo further changes. If a piece of bone has been torn off along with the cartilage, the broken surface of the former always secures for itself a new cover-

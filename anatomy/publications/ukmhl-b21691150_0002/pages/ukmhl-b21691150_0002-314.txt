ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 196 both the bones and the soft tissues, in these cases, showing a diminution in the amount which they con- tain not only of lime but also of those elements which remain as ashes after everything else has been de- stroyed by fire. In this form of rachitis all the path- ological alterations disappear just as soon as sufficient (and suitable) nutriment is supplied to the tissues. A somewhat similar form of the disease—that is, one that is dependent upon the lack of lime—may occur in children when, notwithstanding the fact that their nutriment contains the requisite amount of lime, its absorption into the system is materially diminished by the long persistence of digestive disorders—more especially* diarrhceal affections. A tendency to cer- tain diseases—e.g., bronchitis, catarrhal pneumonia, catarrhal affections of the stomach and intestines, and spasm of the glottis—is often a characteristic of ra- chitis. The ultimate cause of rachitis is not clearly understood. The artificial nourishment of infants with unsuitable articles of food, and disturbances of the digestive organs, as well as unfavorable hygienic surroundings, undoubtedly favor the development of this disease. On the other hand, as a rule, it only rarely attacks children who derive their nourishment from the breast. That rachitis is favored by living in confined quar- ters, by breathing bad air, and by lack of physical Fra. ".—Curvature and Deformity of the Lower Extremities, Due to Rachitis. In this patient—a girl, eight years old—who had suffered severely at some previous time from rachitis, but in whom the disease might at this time be considered as cured, the tubular bones, and espe- cially those of the left side, are curved in a marked degree and in various directions, and at more than one point they are sharply bent (partial fractures). The upper extremities are only very slightly altered.

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 188 often wart shaped or pedunculate, and occasionally ring shaped (a periostosis). Multiple symmetrical exostoses (developmental exos- toses) are uniformly located near the lines of the epi- physes. They grow out from the intermediary car- tilage, and they rarely commence their development during youth. When the growth of the normal bone ceases, these exostoses also stop growing. They are apt to be associated with disturbances in the longi- tudinal growth of the bones. As regards their etiol- ogy, heredity undoubtedly plays the leading part. The anomaly is observed more often in men than in women. Osteophytes are to be considered as constituting special forms of hyperostosis. They are usually dis- tributed over quite large areas. Numerous osteo- phytes often develop upon the internal surface of the anterior part of the skull cap—particularly during pregnancy. They give to the bony surface a satin- like appearance, and they are usually absorbed dur- ing the lying-in period. It is rare that they leave any permanent thickening of the skull. The bodies of the vertebrae are often the seat of osteophytic growths of a more pronounced character—growths which pre- sent a serrated, or a wart-like, or a thorn-shaped con- figuration. By the term synostosis is meant the bony fusion of bones which under normal conditions are separated by sutures. Atrophy of Bone. Two forms of atrophy of bone are distinguished: the external or concentric, and the internal or eccen- tric.

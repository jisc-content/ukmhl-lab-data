145 SEXUAL APPARATUS. connective-tissue growthsâ€”that is, in the form of a fibro-adenoma, a myxo-adenoma, or an adeno-sar- coma. When there is a tendency to the formation of cysts, there will be developed a cystadenoma. The adenoma is often of small size, and its growth advances slowly. Often, too, it serves merely as the forerunner of a malignant adenoma (adeno-carcinoma) or of a genuine cancer. Carcinoma of the Mammary Gland. Cancer of the breast is the most frequent carcino- matous disease of the female sex, and it represents about four-fifths of all mammary tumors. The following forms are recognized: the carcinoma simplex, the carcinoma medullare, the carcinoma fibrosum, and the carcinoma gelatinosum or colloid carcinoma. The carcinoma simplex occurs in two principal forms: the glandular and the tubular. At first it is a small nodular growth which is immovably attached to the tissues immediately around it; it is not sepa- rated from its surroundings by any sharp limits. The nodule is, as a rule, intimately associated with the overlying skin, and this is particularly the case when it is located near the nipple. When the tumor is cut open with the knife, there is presented to the eye a grayish-white area (corresponding to the cut surface of the nodule) which has a lardaceous ap- pearance, and presents scattered whitish-yellow spots. WTien the edge of the knife is drawn over this cut sur- face a somewhat thick, grayish-white juice is obtained which under the microscope will be found to consist principally of epithelial elements, some of them

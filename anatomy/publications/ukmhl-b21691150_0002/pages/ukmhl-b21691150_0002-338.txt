A congenital dislocation (Fig. 16) which occurs, for example, in the hip-joint depends upon defects in development which have originated during intra-uter- ine life (e.g., hypoplasia of the acetabulum), or upon displacements that have taken place during the same period (foetal dislocations of a spontaneous nature). Dislocations of this kind occur most frequently in the female sex (eighty-seven per cent), and in two-fifths of all cases both sides of the body are affected. Spontaneous dislocations occur as a result of articu- lar inflammations. They may be due to relaxation and softening of the ligaments and surrounding cap- suleâ€”alterations which may occur in the exudative forms of inflammation. (These are termed disloca- tions due to distention.) Or the luxation may occur in consequence of a destructive caries and necrosis of the articular ends of the bones, this being especially apt to happen at the hip and knee joints. (These are termed dislocations due to the destructive action of disease.) Traumatic dislocations are rarely the result of vio- lence inflicted directly upon the joint; they are pro- duced, in the great majority of instances, by a force which acts upon the latter indirectly. In the indirect form of luxation the dislocated end of the bone is pushed with such force against the articular capsule as to cause it to tear and so permit a passage for the bone through the torn opening. The articular end of

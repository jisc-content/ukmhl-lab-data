Explanation of Plate 18. Tuberculosis of the Uterus, Vagina, Fallopian Tubes, and Left Ovary. The cavity of the uterus contains a yellowish, greasy- looking substance, which evidently represents uterine tissue in a state of cheesy necrosis. The mucous mem- brane, throughout its entire extent, is converted into a friable, opaque-yellow, cheesy material. The necrotic process extends, at numerous places, into the deeper layers of the muscular coat. The left Fallopian tube is represented by a tough, thickened cord; its lumen is dilated, and the mucous membrane which lines it, like that of the uterus, is in a condition of diffuse cheesy necrosis. The right tube is in much the same con- dition. The left ovary is also converted into a crum- bling, cheesy mass. Upon the posterior upper wall of the vagina there are several shallow ulcers, coated with an opaque-yellow material, and separated from the sur- rounding tissues by sharply defined limits. Douglas’ space is obliterated (adhesive pelveo-peritonitis). Upon the peritoneal covering of the uterus and its appendages there are numerous tuberculous eruptions, some of them arranged after the manner of a string of pearls. In addition to the lesions described above, there were found in this patient-—a woman, fifty-four years of age —the following pathological conditions: Ulcerating tuberculosis of the upper portions of the colon; second- ary cheesy tuberculosis of the mesenteric and retroperi- toneal lymph glands; and also tuberculosis of the abdominal peritoneum, with slight inflammatory altera- tions (subchronic tuberculous peritonitis). Finally, in the upper lobe of the left lung there were evidences of localized apex-tuberculosis of older date, together with

Explanation of Plate 32. Apoplexy op the Right Hemisphere of the Brain (Nucleus Caudatus and Nucleus Lentiformis; Capsula Interna). In the right cerebral hemisphere, at a point corre- sponding to the location of the nucleus lentiformis, and extending from this outward as far as to the capsula in- terna, is an irregularly shaped cavit}r, somewhat larger than an English walnut, which is filled with dark, red- dish-brown masses of clotted blood. Its walls in some places show a rusty red discoloration. Some bloody serum is present in the right lateral ventricle. The rest of the cerebral parenchyma is tough, the brain as a whole being atrophic (it weighs 1,220 gm.). The large ar- teries at the base of the brain are in a condition of marked atheromatous degeneration; the arteria pro fossa Sylvii is obliterated. Among the other pathological conditions found in this woman, who was sixty-nine years of age, the following may be mentioned: Chronic interstitial nephritis and hypertrophy of the heart (both ventricles), which weighed 475 gm. (the normal weight being from 250 to 300 gm.). (No. 81, 1895.)

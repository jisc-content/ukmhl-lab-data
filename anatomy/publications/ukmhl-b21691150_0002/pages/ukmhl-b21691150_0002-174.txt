56 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. be that of fine striae and flecks. Traumatic hemor- rhages occur in consequence of injuries to the kid- neys, as after a fall from a height, gunshot wounds, etc.; and in connection with these it is not unusual to find that there has also been an escape of blood underneath the capsule (perirenal hemorrhage) and into the pelvis of the kidney (haematuria). Embolism of branches of the renal artery leads to the formation of hemorrhagic infarctions, which are char- acterized by their wedge-like shape (the base or broad part of the wedge being located at the surface of the kidney, while the apex corresponds to the point where the embolus plugs the blood-vessel). Embolic infarc- tions (Plate 2) vary in size, but the majority of them are no larger than a pea or a small bean. They are of a pale color (anaemic infarction) with a red, hemor- rhagic border zone (see Plate 2). The tissues which are thus deprived of their arterial blood-supply rap- idly undergo anaemic necrosis and fatty degeneration. In the place of these tissues which have died and have been gradually absorbed, there will be found a certain amount of cicatricial fibrous tissue, the retraction of which causes the formation of a depression or pit of greater or less extent. Small embolic infarctions are often composed wholly of escaped blood. Kidneys containing cicatrices that owe their origin to repeated embolisms are oftenest encountered in individuals who have had valvular diseases of the left side of the heart, or ulcerous sclerosis of the aorta, or the forma- tion of thrombi in the left heart chamber or in the aorta. When the embolus is of an infectious charac- ter, as in septico-pysemic processes, an abscess is sure to develop at the seat of the infarction (Plate

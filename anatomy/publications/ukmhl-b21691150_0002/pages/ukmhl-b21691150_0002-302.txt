184 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. narrowing of the vertebral canal; but then again, at other times, even a moderate degree of pressure seems to suffice to destroy some of the nerve fibres, and thus to effect a partial interruption of the communications which pass through the cord. A compressing force which is kept up for some length of time causes a flattening of the cord and induces disturbances of nutrition; and, as a secondary result, it leads to de- generative atrophy of the fibres and nerve cells, and yet without causing any alterations to take place which might be termed inflammatory in their nature. Poliomyelitis Anterior Acuta. (Spinal Infantile Paralysis.) This disease is located in the gray matter of the anterior horns. It is probably of vascular origin and dependent upon infection, and it is encountered in children in the first years of life (between the second and third years). The pathological process is gener- ally located in the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cordâ€”more rarely in the cervical portion. As a re- sult of the acute inflammatory process the affected anterior horn undergoes atrophy and shrinking. Then, among the sequelae of the disease in the spinal cord, the following deserve to be mentioned: degen- erative atrophy of the corresponding motor nerves and muscles; disturbances in the growth of the cor- responding extremities; contractures; and loose joints.

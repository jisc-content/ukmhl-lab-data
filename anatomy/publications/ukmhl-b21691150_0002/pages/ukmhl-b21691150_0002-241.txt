123 SEXUAL APPARATUS. putrid intoxication with the products of decompo- sition, or else there may be a combination of both processes—infection and intoxication. Infection of the puerperal uterus may usually be attributed to infection introduced from without (direct or indirect transfer of the contagium), as by means of unclean hands or instruments,* and only excep- tionally to that produced by pathogenic germs which were already previously present in the vagina or at the vaginal entrance (cases of so-called self-infection). In the normal secretions of the genital organs of healthy pregnant women streptococci are not found. As a matter of fact, these secretions, through the bactericidal power wrhich they possess, furnish pro- tection against pathogenic germs which sometimes (as saprophytes) make their appearance when certain changes take place in these secretions. When the processes which take place at childbirth and during the lying-in period put a temporary stop to this nat- ural immunity, these saprophytes may for a certain time assume a parasitic character. Gonorrhoeal endometritis shows a decided tendency to localize itself in the neck of the uterus (gonorrhoeal cervical endometritis), and the mucous membrane of the body of the organ may escape entirely. The pathological alterations are hypersemia and redness * Out of 149 cases of puerperal fever which came under obser- vation between the years 1877 and 1883, in the city of Basle, 44 (= 30 per cent) passed through the hands of tw7o midwives. Apropos of this subject, it is of importance to note the fact that infection of the genital canal takes place both before and after the birth of the child, through contact of the fingers with the parts—through vaginal infection (due to too much intermed- dling).

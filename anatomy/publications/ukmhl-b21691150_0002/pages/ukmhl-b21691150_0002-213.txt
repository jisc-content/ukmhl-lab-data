Chronic inflammation of the prostate may result from a preceding acute inflammation. Under these circum- stances the parenchyma of the gland presents a brown- ish discoloration. In chronic affections of the urinary apparatus which are of an infectious character ab- scesses are also likely to develop. Tuberculosis of the prostate occurs as an intercurrent phenomenon in genito-urinary tuberculosis. Enlargement of the prostate occurs with special fre- quency in advanced lifeâ€”that is, in about one-third of all old men. In these cases the enlargement may be due either to a genuine hypertrophy or (more rarely) to the presence of a diffuse adenoma, or a fibro-myoma, or some mixed form of tumor (a sharp separation between the different forms of tumors being often an impossibility). The adenomata are generally characterized by a softer consistence, while the fibro-myomata are quite tough. The prostate is very rarely the seat of a malignant tumor (sarcoma or carcinoma). Enlargement of the prostate is apt to cause a narrowing of the prostatic part of the ure- thra or of the orifice of this canal in the bladder. The latter condition is observed particularly in those cases in which the middle lobe of the gland protrudes like a plug into the neck of the bladder, so that when the latter contracts it (the middle lobe) is forced like a sponge, under the pressure of the onflowing urine, against the orifice of the urethra. As a secondary result of this state of affairs there occur other altera- tions, like those which are observed in strictures of

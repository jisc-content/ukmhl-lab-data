ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 114 and an abnormally heavy uterus, both of which fac- tors are present during the lying-in period (only from six to seven per cent of all cases occurring in women who have borne no children). Among the other fac- tors which are occasionally present may be men- tioned the following: increased intra-abdominal pres- sure, such as takes place when some task requiring heavy bodily labor is performed (lifting a heavy load, a jump, a fall). In advanced life the disappearance of a certain amount of fat from the body is likely to favor this relaxed condition of the pelvic organs. Still other favoring factors are these: abnormal breadth of the pelvis and slight inclination forward of its vertical axis, and extensive ruptures of the perineum. Inversion of the uterus occurs both during the lying- in period and also at other times. In the former case the condition is produced when a pulling-down force is applied to that relaxed and thin portion of the uterus where the placenta was attached. Outside of the lying-in period, the condition may be produced by pedunculated tumors (submucous myomata) which tend to advance farther and farther downward, and at the same time to exert traction upon a portion of the uterine wall. In this way, a complete inversion of the uterus will in due time be produced, the inverted parts eventually presenting themselves outside the vulvar opening. Stenosis and Atresia of the Uterus. Congenital narrowness of the genital canal involves as a rule the neck of the uterus throughout its entire length, and particularly the outer orifice of the os ex-

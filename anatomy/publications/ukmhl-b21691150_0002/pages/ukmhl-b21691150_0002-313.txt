THE BONES AND JOINTS. 195 the transverse diameter either remains normal or is increased in length. In the extremities certain changes occur, in addi- tion to the enlargement of the articular ends of the bones (knobbed limbs, rickets). These are a dimi- nution in the longitudinal growth of the bone, and a tendency to curvatures and incomplete fractures (see Fig. 7). The lower extremities (one alone is rarely affected) are usually involved symmetrically; both the thighs and the legs being curved outward like a bow (bowlegs). With the subsequent development of the skeleton a certain amount of compensatory im- provement of the deformity usually takes place, so that when the individual reaches adult life only a slight bending of the bones remains. In a number of cases an incomplete fracture is apt to take place in the legs, just above the ankles. In the ordinary cases of infantile rachitis (observed most often between the ninth and the twenty-fourth months of life) the deposition of bone earth is ren- dered difficult by reason of the primary disease of the bone tissue; and that, too, notwithstanding the fact that in the process of nourishment a sufficient amount of lime salts is both introduced into the system and absorbed by it. It can be demonstrated that the soft tissues contain a larger proportion of solid matters, and particularly more lime, than they do under nor- mal conditions. The bone cartilage apparently loses the power of taking up the requisite quantities of cal- cium phosphate. In animals it is practicable, by the administration of food which contains comparatively little lime, to induce rachitis (an artificially produced rachitis);

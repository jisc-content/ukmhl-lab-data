ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 192 which is located between the other two, develops from the fractured ends of the bones, and is very scanty in quantity. The more delicate changes which take place in the development of a callus are the following: In the first place, the cellular elements—both those of the bone marrow and those of the inner layer of the periosteum —commence to proliferate. The cellular and very vascular granulation tissue which is thus produced aids in bringing about a partial absorption of the bone at the fractured ends. In the layer of tissue which lies immediately next to the old bone, quite large epi- thelioid cells (osteoblasts) are develojjed, and it is from these that the new bone tissue, fully provided with bone corpuscles, is produced; or else the prolif- erating periosteum produces either an osteoid tissue in which the bone cells are arranged in groups, or a tissue which consists of hyaline cartilage and which later becomes converted into bone tissue. The callus which has thus been created is at first rather spongy in character, but later it grows more and more dense; and, besides, it may undergo a still further diminution in size through the absorption of superfluous parts. Indeed, at the last, it is possible for a sort of medullary canal to form. The formation of a callus often shows—especially in cachectic patients—a tendency to progress slowly. It is considered an unfavorable termination of a bone fracture when the union of the two fragments is effected by masses of fibrous tissue and not by a bony callus. Such a termination is observed in cases of general cachexia and of syphilis. When an imperfect consolidation takes place, there may be formed, at the

Explanation of Plate 9. Acute Parenchymatous Nephritis (Stage op Fatty Degeneration). The Nephritis of Pregnancy. Fig. a.—Capsule very easily removed. Surface of kidney smooth and glistening. Color a pale grayish- yellow. Parenchyma easily friable. Boundary line be- tween cortex and medulla sharply defined. The cortex, which is of a grayish-yellow color, contains but little blood, and the striations are not easily distinguishable. When the edge of the knife is drawn lightly over the cut surface of the organ an opaque juice is obtained in abundance. The pyramids are rendered conspicuous by their livid red color. When pressed upon, the papillae give escape to an opaque, rather thick juice. The ureters are not dilated. Under the microscope it is seen that fatty degeneration of the epithelial elements of the urinary canaliculi is quite uniformly distributed throughout the organ. Among the other pathological alterations which were found in this woman, who was forty-three years old and who had been delivered of her first child, by means of forceps, forty-six hours before her death (without con- vulsions), the following should be mentioned: A moder- ate degree of general dropsy; oedema of the lungs; com- mencing hypostatic pneumonia of both lower lobes; meningeal apoplexy extending over the left cerebral hemisphere and the right corpus striatum ; multiple sub- serous myonlata of the uterus.

Fig. b.— In the pyramids of the kidney, which dis- plays a general icteric discoloration, uric-acid concretions of a golden-yellow color may be seen in the form of radiating striations.

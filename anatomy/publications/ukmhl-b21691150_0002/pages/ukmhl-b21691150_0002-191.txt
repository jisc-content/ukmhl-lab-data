URINARY APPARATUS. 73 Nephro-Lithiasis. (Plate 10, Fig. b.) Concretions and calculi are often found in the pel- vis of the human kidne3r in middle life and in old age, and rather more often in men than in women. The concretions occur in the form of gravel-like masses, which are commonly composed of uric acid and its salts. In about twenty per cent of all cases the calculi and concretions are found in both pelves. Calculi are found in the actual substance of the kid- ney in about half of one per cent of all the dead bodies of adults. The following varieties of calculi may be distin- guished : 1. Uratic calculi, composed of uric acid and the urates. Calculi of pure uric acid are sometimes en- countered. They are of moderate size and somewhat round, when they occur singly; or they are provided with facets when several of them are found together. Often they are branched, like a piece of coral, repre- senting true casts of the pelvis of the kidney. They are of a yellowish-red or brownish color, and are composed of concentrically placed laminae. In an- other group belong the calculi which are composed of the uric-acid salts (urates of ammonium and mag- nesium). 2. Calculi composed of the oxalate of calcium. These calculi are decidedly hard, and their surface is covered with small, rounded projections or regu- larly arranged prickle-like processes, of a blackish-

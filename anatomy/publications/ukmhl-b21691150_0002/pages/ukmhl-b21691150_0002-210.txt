Under favorable circumstances (as when the antisyphilitic treatment has proved successful) the inflammatory products are gradually absorbed and a fibrous cica- trix alone remains. An adhesive peri-orchitis, with obliteration of the sac of the tunica vaginalis, is very apt to be an accompaniment of syphilitic disease of the testicle. Tumors of the Testicle. Among the primary tumors of the testicle sarcoma is the commonest. Adenoma and carcinoma occur more rarely. Tumors of a mixed composition are not uncommon. Such are cystoid growths, enchon- dromata, cysto-sarcomata, and cysto-carcinomata. These mixed tumors are of a teratoid nature, contain- ing tissue-elements which have descended from the ecto-, meso-, and endo-derm. While they are of con- genital origin, they lie dormant for years, and take on active growth only at some later period of life (after puberty). They are very closely related to the solid teratomata of the ovary. The scrotum is often affected by elephantiasis, and also by a pronounced type of oedema, as in general dropsy. Various inflammations, which may terminate in phlegmon or in putrefaction, may also involve the scrotum. Thus, for example, they may develop in the course of peri-urethral abscesses of the perineum, and as a result of the infiltration of urine resulting from defects of the urethra.

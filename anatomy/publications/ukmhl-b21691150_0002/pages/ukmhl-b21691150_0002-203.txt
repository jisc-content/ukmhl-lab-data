85 URINARY APPARATUS. established, and the urine is only imperfectly voided. These calculi, after they have reached the bladder, increase in size through the formation of concretions upon their surface, and in this manner stones of con- siderable size are sometimes developed. Further- more, calculi are formed independently in the bladder when retention of urine exists—a condition which is characterized by the fact that the bladder is no longer able to expel the urine completely. Such a condition of retention may develop in the course of some in- flammatory trouble or a gonorrhoea, or it may result from hypertrophy of the prostate. In a similar man- ner concretions are formed around some foreign body, such as the fragment of a catheter which has been broken off in the bladder, or some other object which has—perhaps for masturbation purposes—been intro- duced into the urethra, and then has accidentally found its way into the bladder. Hairpins, cylindri- cal needle cases, and lead pencils are among the ob- jects which have thus served as nuclei for the forma- tion of a stone in the bladder. These calculi in the urinary bladder are dangerous on account of the cystitis which accomjjanies them. Now and then a fatal termination occurs through pyelo-nephritis and septicaemia. DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. By far the most common and at the same time the most important disease of the urethra is gonorrhoeal inflammation caused by the gonococcus. In addition to the alterations which are characteristic of all in- flammations, it will be found, in the commencement

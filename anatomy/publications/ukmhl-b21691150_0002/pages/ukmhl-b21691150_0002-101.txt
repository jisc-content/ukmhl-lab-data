Explanation of Plate 29. Chronic Tuberculous Cheesy Pachymeningitis Spinalis in a Case of Tuberculous Caries of the Spinal Column. After the vertebral canal had been laid open, the outer surface of the dura mater presented, throughout a length of 5 cm., the appearance of being covered with irregu- larly shaped, easily broken down, opaque-yellow de- posits, which in some places resembled fungous growths. The margins of this purulent and cheesy deposit were irregularly reddened. The dura itself, over the affected area, had disappeared in the midst of the cheesy mass. (The individual vertebrae are sketched in diagrammatic fashion in the drawing; no account being taken of the primary caries of the body of one of these vertebrae.)

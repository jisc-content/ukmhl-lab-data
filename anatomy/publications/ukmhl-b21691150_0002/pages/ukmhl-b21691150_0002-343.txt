THE BONES AND JOINTS. 225 develops from the opposite articular surface. A fibrous metamorphosis theu takes place in these in- flammatory products and leads to the union of the joint surfacesâ€”i.e., to a fibrous ankylosis, or, if ossification takes place in the newly formed masses of tissue, to a bony ankylosis. The process which takes place in a case of this kind is similar to that which is observed in adhesive inflammations of serous membranes like the pleura and the pericardium. Gouty Arthritis; Arthritis Urica. (Plate 51.) Under the influence of some disturbance of the gen- eral metabolic processes (such as the defective con- version of the uric-acid which is formed in the spleen and in the lymphatic organs of the digestive tract into urea, and the retention of uric acid in the blood and in the liver) uric-acid salts (sodium urate or cal- cium urate) are deposited in the articular cartilages. This does not take place all at once, but little by little, on different occasions, and while the synovial membrane is in a condition of inflammatory redness; and, furthermore, the deposit of uric acid is preceded by inflammatory and necrotic changes. The products which give rise to these predisposing necrotic changes in the tissues are still, for the present, unknown. The urates are deposited in the cartilage cells and in their capsules in the form of star-shaped needles and bundles of crystals. The cartilaginous covering of the affected joints (particularly the metatarso-phalan- geal joint of the big toe and the finger-joints) presents the appearance, in the early part of the disease, as if

Explanation of Plate 40. Rhachitis of the Femur and One of the Ribs. Rliachitis of the Lower End of the Femur. Fig. a.—The lower end of this bone is very much swollen; it is more than half as large again as it should be. The normal, white, cartilaginous epiphysis is placed next to a bluish-colored zone of cartilage which is broader than normal and is in a state of active proliferation. Then, next to this, comes the layer of osteoid tissue which is provided with blood-vessels and medullary spaces, which are pushing their way into the cartilagi- nous zone; while, higher up still, may be seen the pale red and spotted ordinary osteoid tissue. Last of all comes the medullary cavity, surrounded by the thin and compact bony cortex. Rhachitis of a Rib, at the Point where the Cartila- ginous and OsseoiLs Portions Unite. Fig. b.—At the point of union between the bony end and the cartilage the rib is appreciably swollen (rickety rosary). There is excessive growth of cartilage with insufficient calcification. The zone of cartilage is in- creased in breadth, it has an abnormal bluish color, and the outline of its boundary is irregular. Through the incomplete substitution of medullary spaces for cartilage tissue, the latter may be said to have undergone a direct conversion into osteoid substance, as a result of which there is a certain amount of enlargement of the affected region.

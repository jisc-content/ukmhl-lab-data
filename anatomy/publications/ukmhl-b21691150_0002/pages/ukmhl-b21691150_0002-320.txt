202 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. If the disease is located near the epiphyseal line, the epiphysis may become loosened from its attachment to the underlying bone, and the intermediate carti- lage may either undergo simple displacement or else be destroyed by suppurative inflammation. Tuberculosis of Bone Structures. (Plates 46 and 47.) » Tuberculosis of bone occurs rarely as a primary disease; it is almost always secondary to tuberculous disease in some other part of the body. The infec- tion is uniformly haematogenous in character; that is, the tuberculous poison is transferred from one spot to another along the route of the blood current, in much the same way as an embolus is transported. Youth- ful individuals are specially predisposed to the dis- ease. The soft parts of a bone—particularly the bone marrow—undoubtedly afford, for the lodgement and multiplication of the poison (the tubercle bacilli), conditions as favorable as those furnished by the lymph glands. Tuberculous disease of bone or of a joint develops very often as a result of some mechani- cal injury; and this circumstance explains how it happens—which is a fact—that the male sex is more afflicted with this form of tuberculous disease than is the female. (Differences in the injuriousness of their respective occupations.) So far as the question of localization is concerned, it is sufficient to state that the bones of the trunk of the body (more particularly those of the spinal column) are affected in about one- third of all the cases, and those of the lower extremi- ties are affected in about the same proportion; while

In some cases, when the mucous membrane of the body of the uterus becomes involved, an analogous ascending in- flammation of the Fallopian tubes and pelvic perito- neum follows in course of time. The disease may disappear entirely or it may per- sist in a chronic form. In chronic gonorrhoeal endometritis the fluid secreted becomes more and more scanty, looks like milk, and is sometimes glassy in appearance. Gonococci are generally very few in number and difficult to find. Chronic Endometritis. According as the framework or the gland tubules are the structures chiefly involved, two varieties of this disease are usually recognizedâ€”an interstitial and a glandular endometritis. In the interstitial vari- ety the connective-tissue stroma is both hypersemic and oedematous; its tissues are in a proliferating state, and cellular elements fill its interstices; and generally this condition is associated with a discharge of a purulent fluid from the surface of the mucous membrane. In glandular endometritis the glands ap- pear to be increased in number, to have grown longer, and to have assumed a serpentine shape. This is particularly true of cases in which a true dysmenor- rhoea exists. In the higher degrees of the disease the mucous membrane appears to have undergone considerable thickening, its surface being thrown into rounded hummocks and ridges. To this condition the terms

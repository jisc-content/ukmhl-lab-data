139 SEXUAL APPARATUS. In their further growth they may attain almost any size—from that of a walnut to that of a child’s head, or even a larger size (elephantiasis vulvce). Tumors of this nature present a knobbed appearance, their surface being often lobulated or like that of a cauli- flower.

Cysts containing either a watery fluid or a mixture of mucus and blood are now and then seen in the walls of the vagina; and cysts containing gas (emphysema of the vagina, col- pohyperplasia cystica) are seen even more rarely than these. Soft and indurated ulcers of venereal origin are often met with upon the inner surface of the nymphse and labia majora, on the commissure, and in the vestibule. DISEASES OF THE FEMALE MAMMARY GLANDS. Imperfect development of the mammary glands— hypoplasia—may be attributed to various causes. It is one of the manifestations of a general subnormal development of the entire body; it is often associated with defective sexual development (rudimentary state of the ovaries and uterus); it may also be due to wearing unsuitable clothing which exerts pressure upon the glands while their development is progress- ing ; and, finally, it is extremely common in women who are in other respects normally developed, but who have inherited a predisposition to imperfect de- velopment of the breasts. The transmission of such a predisposition from parent to offspring is some-

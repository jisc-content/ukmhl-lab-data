of the right ventricle of the heart. (No. 584, 1894.) like breakfast rolls, of a clear grayish-yellow color, and lying side by side. The surface of these stones was covered with thorn-like projections. Among the other lesions foimd in this body were the following: Commenc- ing uraemic enteritis; obsolete tuberculous disease at the apices of both lungs; emphysema of the lungs; brown atrophy of the heart. The body generally was much emaciated. (No. 719, 1895.) Explanation of Plate 11. Sarcoma of the Kidney. (Reduced one-half in size.) When the abdominal cavity was opened there was found, in the place of the kidney, a tensely elastic, fluc- tuating tumor, as large as the head of a child. This large mass, when cut into, proved to be composed partly of the kidney, and partly of a tumor (the size of two lists) which was attached to its lower border, and which was composed of spongy, whitish-yellow and orange- colored masses of tissue. In the centre of the tumor there was a cyst as large as a manâ€™s fist, and provided with a tough envelope of fibrous tissue. The kidney itself was separated from the tumor at almost all points, by sharply defined limits; but near the middle of the organ a point was visible on the surface where the tissues of the tumor were forcing their way into the kidney. Aside from this the renal parenchyma was somewhat atrophic and the pelvis dilated. As to the tumor, it is evident that it must have developed from some point on the surface of the kidney, presumably from some mis- placed remnants of the suprareneal body which had found their way into the outermost portions of the cor- tex of the kidney, underneath the capsule, and had lain there harmlessly for a considerable length of time. As causes of the death of this woman, who was fifty- five years old, may be mentioned the following: Septi- caemia, originating in a phlegmon of the lower part of the right leg; emphysema of the lungs; and dilatation

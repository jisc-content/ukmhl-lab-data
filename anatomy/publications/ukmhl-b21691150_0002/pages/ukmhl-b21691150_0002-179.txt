61 URINARY APPARATUS. one-half and sometimes even to one-third the normal breadth, and the line of demarcation between it and the pyramidal substance is almost obliterated. Under the microscope it will be seen that the stroma has undergone a marked increase, and that it is infiltrated with an abundance of round cells, which are aggre- gated in more or less well-defined areas. The Mal- pighian bodies will be found in general to possess thickened capsules, and they themselves present every possible degree of contraction and hyaline atrophy. In consequence of the condensation of the parenchyma of the cortex the Malpighian coils are brought so much nearer together that, instead of two or three, sometimes as many as six or even eight may be seen at the same time in the field of vision. The walls of the arteries are thickened, particularly the adventitia and the intima. Small cysts containing serum are often seen scattered throughout the atro- phic tissue. In the earlier stages of the process, which now and then come under our observation, as when a patient dies of some intercurrent disease like tuberculosis, pleurisy, or apoplexy, the picture pre- sented is that of an interstitial nephritis, occurring perhaps more often in the form of separate centres of inflammation, and characterized by the presence of very small granulations upon the surface of the kidney (when freed from its capsule) and by only a slight diminution in size of the organ. The question of the etiology of the genuine contracted lddncy is surrounded by a great deal of obscurity. The disease occurs about twice as often in men as in women. The period of life at which it develops most commonly is that from the fortieth to the sixtieth

The conditions here are not those of a simple accumulation of fluid in a sac, but rather those of a diffuse inflammation (peri-orchitis serosa), characterized by the pouring out of fluid into the in- terstices of the tissues. The disease owes its origin to some mechanical injury, or it may develop in con- nection with an epididymitis gonorrhceica. In course of time the serous exudation becomes absorbed and the parts return to a natural condition; or connective- tissue adhesions which cause an obliteration of the sac of the tunica vaginalis may remain as a result of the inflammation; or, finally, the inflammation may become chronic in character (hydrocele chronica). In the latter case the sac containing the fluid steadily increases in size and assumes the shape of a pear. It may increase to the size of a man’s fist or even to that of a child’s head, and the imprisoned fluid may weigh several pounds. The term varicocele signifies a varicose enlargement of the veins of the spermatic cord, in which condition the enlarged veins form a convolution of worm-like cords. DISEASES OP THE PROSTATE. Acute inflammation (prostatitis) with swelling of the gland occurs frequently as a result of gonorrhoeal ure- thritis or in consequence of some mechanical injury (employment of the catheter, false passages). If it goes on to suppuration, abscesses are likely to form, and these may either break or they may become en- capsulated, their contents then undergoing inspissa- tion and eventually becoming converted into a chalky material. When a perforation occurs and a fistula is

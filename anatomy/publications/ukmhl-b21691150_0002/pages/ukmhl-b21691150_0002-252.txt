In cancer of the body of the uterus its internal surface will be found to have been eaten away by deep ulceration, and the uterine cavity will be correspondingly en- larged. The disease also shows a tendency to involve the neighboring peritoneum. In the further growth of a uterine cancer it is a common occurrence for the anterior wall of the vagina to undergo complete destruction, while at the same time the posterior wall of the bladder becomes infil- trated with cancerous elements. In from twenty-five to thirty per cent of these cases a vesico-vaginal fis- tula will be formed. Furthermore, in a large majority of the cases secondary carcinosis of the correspond- ing lymph glands—especially the retroperitoneal, prevertebral lymph glands, which lie at the entrance to the pelvis—may be expected. Metastatic carcino- sis of the liver, lungs, kidneys, and other organs occurs more rarely. While the destructive process is advancing toward the peritoneal lining of the smaller pelvis, an inflammatory reaction is developed in the latter, and as a result of this an obliterating and adhesive pelveo-peritonitis follows, particularly in the region of Douglas’ cul-de-sac. It is only now and then that the disease takes on the character of a fatal purulent peritonitis. In about two-fifths of all the cases the cancerous infiltration of the walls of the bladder, in the neighborhood of the openings of the ureters, leads to narrowing of these channels, and this in turn induces hydronephrosis with a corre- sponding obliteration of the renal substance.

Explanation of Plate 6. Embolic (Benign) Infarction of the Kidney, Com- bined with Necrosis of the Tissues. In the immediate vicinity of the pelvis of the kidney is a cloudy-yellow, sharply limited pocket or area of necrosed tissues, about the size of a hazelnut. This focus of disease extends through all the intervening pa- renchyma to the very surface of the kidney, its longer axis running in a direction at right angles to this sur- face. The remaining tissues of the organ possess a dirty reddish-brown color, while the mucous membrane of the pelvis is of a dirty grayish-green hue (this discoloration being a post-mortem effect). The corresponding branch of the renal artery was found to be plugged with a be- nign, non-infectious embolus.

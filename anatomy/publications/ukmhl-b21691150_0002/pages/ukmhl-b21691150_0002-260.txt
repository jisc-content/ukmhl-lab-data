142 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. in wliicli only a segment of the gland is involved (usually the lower and outer portions only)- The lobule which is inflamed presents a swollen appear- ance, and the skin which covers it is reddened. In the inflamed area an infiltration of cellular elements takes place in the intralobular connective-tissue frame- work, and the tissues break down into pus—in a word, the inflammation results in the formation of an ab- scess. This may empty itself by breaking through into the lacteal ducts, in which case the pus can be pressed out through the openings in the nipple; or the rupture may take place outwardly through the skin; or, finally, the collection of pus may be emp- tied by means of an incision. When an abscess has thus been laid open, its walls will be found to be fis- sured and covered with shreds. There may be quite a large number of separate abscesses, and in some cases new ones are constantly forming and breaking through. These fistulous tracks may also — when they happen to communicate with lacteal ducts—dis- charge milk. In this manner milk fistulae are devel- oped, and they may persist for a long time afterward. In rare cases an enveloping capsule may form around the abscess, and the contents of the latter may then undergo, first, inspissation, and afterward calcifica- tion. A purulent mastitis rarely terminates in a severe general infection and septicaemia. In the ma- jority of cases the inflammatory products are ab- sorbed and the parts return to a healthy condition. In some instances the recovery is incomplete; that is, indurated areas (milk nodes) remain behind. These, when more closely examined, are found to be nodulated masses of hyperplastic connective tis-

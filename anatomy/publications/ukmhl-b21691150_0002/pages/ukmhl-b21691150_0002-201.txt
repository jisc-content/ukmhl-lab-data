URINARY APPARATUS. 83 the vagina and the anterior wall of the rectum become involved in the cancerous disease, a vesico-vagino-rec- tal fistula will be established. Furthermore, vesico-vaginal fistulas may develop as a result of an unnatural labor (through pressure of the childâ€™s head, causing necrosis of the soft tissues, in cases of contracted pelvis or of oblique face presen- tations), and especially after the forceps or the per- foratorium has been used in an unskilful manner. They may also develop as a result of certain gynaeco- logical operations. Involuntary evacuation of the blad- der by way of the vagina, and incrustation of the lat- ter with sedimentary deposits from the urine, are the usual results of this pathological condition. It also sometimes happens that an ascending purulent pyelo- nephritis develops in connection with the cystitis which is frequently associated with such a fistula. New Growths of the Bladder. Among the benign tumors that which is oftenest encountered in the bladder is the villous papilloma (papillary fibroma or fibro-epithelioma). These are delicate, spongy, pedunculate tumors, richly sup- plied with blood-vessels, supported by a very scanty framework, but abundantly supplied with an epi- thelial covering. In consequence of their very deli- cate construction, small portions of these growths are often torn off when the bladder is emptied, and are then, together with a certain amount of blood, voided with the urine. Sarcoma of the bladder is a rare disease. It is encountered at long intervals in children.

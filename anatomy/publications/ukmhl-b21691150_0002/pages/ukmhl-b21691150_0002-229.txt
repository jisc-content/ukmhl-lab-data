SEXUAL APPARATUS. Ill DISEASES OF THE UTERUS. Changes in Position. The most important changes in position are those which are due to versions—displacement of the organ as a whole—and those which are due to its being bent upon itself—-flexions. In the case of the former of these changes the angle where the bending occurs is situated in the vault of the vagina, the entire uterus being displaced forward or backward; while in that of the flexions the angle of bending lies very near the os internum of the uterus—in other words, the axis of the body of the organ forms an acute or a right angle with the axis of its cervix. Flexions are either movable or fixed, in the latter case through the instrumentality of the connective- tissue products of an inflammation. Anteflexion of the Uterus.—In this condition the body of the organ rests upon the anterior part of the vault of the vagina, the bent portion either being angular or presenting the shape of a retort. The movable variety of anteflexion may, as a rule, be considered as a physiological condition, while the fixed variety, which is of rare occurrence, is of path- ological origin. Anteversion of the uterus is a condition in which the axis of the cervix and of the body of the organ lies in a horizontal direction, at right angles to the trans- verse axis. The entire uterus having fallen forward, its external orifice looks backward toward the sacrum. When increased intra-abdominal pressure continues for a long time—which may happen, for example, in

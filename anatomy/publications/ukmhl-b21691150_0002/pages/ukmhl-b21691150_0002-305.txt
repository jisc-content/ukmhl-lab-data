The Bones and Joints. DISEASES OF THE BONES. Hypertrophy of Bone. Hypertrophy of bone — hyperostosis — originates either from the periosteum (as an external or eccen- tric hyperostosis) or from the medullary spaces in the interior of the bone (as an internal hyperostosis). In the latter case compact bone tissue takes the place of the normal spongy substance. This change is also known by the terms concentric hyperostosis, osteo- sclerosis, eburnation. Diffuse hyperostosis and sclerosis are often en- countered in the skull cap; the bone in this locality being then twice or even three times as thick as it normally should be, and its spongy interior being converted into compact bone substance. As causes of this change, disturbances in the circulation (stases), rachitis, and syphilis have often been demonstrated. The external variety of hyperostosis is observed either in a diffuse form, involving the entire bone, or in that of a sharply limited outgrowth—an exostosis. An exostosis, which is often the product of an ossi- fying periostitis, is generally composed of compact bone tissue. In a smaller number of cases the inte- rior is found to be spongy. It presents itself under a great variety of forms: serrated, thorn shaped, less

Explanation of Plate 13. Purulent Cystitis, Associated with Necrosis of the Tissues; the Formation of Diverticula of the Urinary Bladder; Cicatricial Narrowing of the Urethra, False Passages, Purulent and Gangrenous Peri- and Para-Urethritis. (Two-thirds natural size.) The mucous membrane of the hypertrophied bladder is irregularly reddened, very much swollen, and covered with striated and spotted membranous masses. The urine itself is discolored and opaque, contains pus and mucus, and smells badly. Upon the left-hand side may be seen a diverticulum, which has been laid open and which communicates with the cavity of the bladder by a narrow opening through which the probe, seen in the picture, has been passed. As the cause and starting- point of the purulent diphtheroid cystitis an old cicatri- cial stricture may be pointed out in the membranous portion of the urethra. In the neighborhood of this stricture the soft parts show a number of centres of puru- lent inflammation associated with the development of gangrene. The pus in these centres is discolored and has a foul odor, indicating that urine has begun to infil- trate the parts. A few of the abscesses communicate with the lumen of the urethra by means of fistulous passages.

108 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. abdominal orifice a limited peritonitis may be ex- cited, or the inflamed tube may itself become closed, and dropsy from retention may follow. Complete restoration of the parts to a healthy state is a com- mon result. In the cases of severe inflammation, particularly those in which a gonorrhoeal inflammation—both with and without other infectious elements—has spread from the vagina and the uterus, the exudation assumes a purulent character. Pus accumulates in large quantity, and to this condition the term pyo- salpinx (Plate 23) is applied. When the peritoneum is involved at the same time, the condition is spoken of as a purulent salpingo-peritonitis and perisalpin- gitis. A purulent breaking down of the tubal wall and perforation into the abdominal cavity are events which occur only rarely. After the purulent salpin- gitis has lasted for a long time, the parts generally return to a healthy condition. A salpingitis with a secretion of ichorous pus, or of a pus which is septic, occurs now and then as a result of a puerperal infectious endometritis, and may also terminate in a fatal salpingo-peritonitis. More commonly the puerperal endometritis spreads to the peritoneum by way of the lymph channels of the uterus and its appendages. It is a rare thing during the puerperal condition to see an acute pur- ulent peritonitis develop, after a latent stage of a certain duration, from a purulent salpingitis (late infection). Tuberculosis of the Fallopian tubes, like that which involves the mucous membrane of the uterus, is ob- served in the form of a cheesy inflammation. The

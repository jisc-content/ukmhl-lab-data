174 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. this condition often grow up as dwarfs; they are simple minded or idiotic, and they generally have some other troubles, such as pareses, or anaesthesise, or contractures. The brain, in these cases, may weigh as little as three hundred grams, or even less. Microcephalia is either a congenital condition, de- pending upon harmful influences which have made themselves felt at the time of conception or during intra-uterine life, or else it is one which is acquired after birth. In the latter event the children are born in a normal condition, but, as a result of various local or general pathological processes, which cause circu- latory disorders and different kinds of inflammations, the development of their brains is affected injuriously. Finally, the premature synostosis of the bones which form the base of the skull, as well as the premature union of the sutures of the skull, is also competent to cause an arrest in the development of the brain and to lead to hypoplasia of this organâ€”to microcephalia. Porencephalia. (Plates 34 and 35.) Defects and fissure formations in the cerebral cor- tex are designated by the term porencephalia. These defective spots are lined with pia, filled with serum, and covered over with the arachnoid. In a certain proportion of the cases the condition is to be con- sidered as one of arrested development (local aplasia), and is to be attributed to a cessation of growth, dur- ing foetal life, in certain portions of the cerebral man- tle. Then, through the overgrowth of neighboring parts of the brain, and through the accidental devel-

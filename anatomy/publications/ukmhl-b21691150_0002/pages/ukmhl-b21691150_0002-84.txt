Explanation of Plate 24. Syphilitic Pemphigus op Newly Born Children, in Congenital Syphilis. Bullous Syphilide of the Skin. (One-third natural size.) The skin is covered with numerous quite large, blad- der-like structures which are filled with pus, and which are very distinct and numerous upon the soles of the feet. These have developed out of livid or brownish-colored spots, which rapidly become converted into pustules and bladders filled with pus. After the latter have ruptured and the pus has been poured out, the formation of ulcers and scabs follows. Through the confluence of several bladders extensive secreting ulcers, with infiltrated bases, may develop. This skin syphilide seems to manifest it- self with special frequency on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Children affected with heredi- tary syphilis are born with the exanthem upon their bodies, or it breaks out shortly after birth. Recovery from the disease is a possibility. In many cases these superficial sores may develop into deep ulcerations and gangrenous sloughs. Gummous products are often found in the internal organs. Osteo-chondritis of the margins of the epiphyses (Wegner) and still other pathological alterations ([e.g., disfigurement of the upper incisor teeth, and keratitis parenchymatosa) are also encountered.

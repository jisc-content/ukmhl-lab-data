URINARY APPARATUS. 75 a papillitis and even to a nephritis, and these in turn may induce a septicaemia or a uraemia; the latter con- dition owing its origin chiefly to the fact that the calculi, especially when they are small (from the size of a pea to that of a bean), travel downward from the pelvis and get tightly wedged in the channel of the ureter. Finally, the renal calculi are usually the first beginnings of what are afterward to be stones in the urinary bladder. The development of the latter goes on hand-in-hand with the deposit of organic material, which furnishes a framework around which the stone- forming materials may be deposited. As one of the direct causes of the formation of a calculus may be set down that anomaly of metabolism, uric-acid diathesis, which is to be ascribed- partly to an inherited predisposition, and partly to external influences (sedentary habits of life, too large a pro- portion of albumin in the diet, excessive indulgence in rich food). DISEASES OF THE PELVIS OF THE KID- NEY AND OF THE URETERS. Dilatation of the pelvis of the kidney—hydronephrosis —is a condition which is often found associated with some obstacle which interferes with the evacuation of the urine; as, for example, narrowing and closure of the ureters under the influence of outside pressure, and blocking of these channels by calculi which have wandered from the pelvis of the kidney. According to the situation of the obstacle which interferes with the evacuation of the urine, the dilatation may in- volve either one or both ureters. When both are

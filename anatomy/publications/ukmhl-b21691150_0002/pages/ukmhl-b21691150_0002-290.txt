ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 172 An encephalitis, which generally occurs in the form of separate hemorrhagic foci (hemorrhagic en- cephalitis), is observed now and then in the course of certain infectious diseases, such as influenza, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, and measles. In autochthonous marasmic thrombosis of the sinuses of the dura mater, and also of the veins belonging to the soft membranes of the brain (e.g., the vena magna of Galen), multiple hemorrhagic foci are also observed. These, it must be remembered, may at times be mis- taken for a hemorrhagic encephalitis. As a cause of cerebral infantile paralysis we some- times encounter an acute encephalitis, either congen- ital in its nature or acquired during early childhood. The disease leaves behind such demonstrable lesions as cicatrices and losses of tissue (porencephalia). v."". Atrophy of the Brain. Simple uncomplicated atrophy of the brain is ob- served most commonly as a senile or presenile affec- tion. The brain—that is, the cerebrum—is more or less diminished in weight and volume; the cerebro- spinal fluid, both in the subarachnoid spaces and in the dilated cerebral ventricles, is increased in quan- tity (hydrocephalus ex vacuo); and the soft mem- branes of the brain are opaque, as if infiltrated with milk. The convolutions are strikingly narrow, almost pointed, and the furrows are noticeably broadened. The organ as a whole is firm and tough, almost like leather. When it is cut open, it is easy to see, on the surface of the section, that the gray matter of the cortex is markedly diminished in breadth, and that

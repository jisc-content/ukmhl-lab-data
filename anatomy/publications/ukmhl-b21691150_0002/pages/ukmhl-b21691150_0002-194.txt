76 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. dilated, the cause is likely to be a carcinoma of the uterus (cervix) with implication of the wall of the bladder, or a stricture of the urethra, or a tumor of the prostate gland. As a result of the interference with the escape of the urine, the pelvis and calyces of the kidney become dilated and are eventually con- verted into a single sac-like cavity; and at the same time the papillae are rendered broader and more flat- tened. The parenchyma of the kidney undergoes atrophy, and becomes tougher in consequence. Ulti- mately, a fluctuating sac, about the size of a man’s fist, takes the place of the kidney, and in its wall some scanty remains of the organ may yet be found. The ureter is dilated to such a degree that it appears like a slightly tortuous canal of about the diameter of one’s thumb. Inflammation of the Pelvis of the Kedney; Pye- litis AND PYELO-NEPHEITIS. The mucous membrane of the pelvis of the kidney is swollen and unevenly reddened, and frequently shows small, disseminated, hemorrhagic foci. Gen- erally the mucous membrane of the ureters presents very much the same pathological alterations. The material which coats the mucous membrane is a slimy, oftentimes purulent fluid. Different stages may be distinguished in the process, according to the nature of the cause from which it has originated. Thus, for example, in the beginning and in the milder degrees of the disease (as in renal calculi), the type is rather one of a desquamative and catarrhal charac- ter, while in the more severe forms the process pre-

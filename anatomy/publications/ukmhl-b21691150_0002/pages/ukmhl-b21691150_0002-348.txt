230 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. the knee is oftener involved than any other joint; and that next in the order of frequency come the hip and elbow joints; these three joints being the ones af- fected in eighty per cent of all the cases of tuberculous joint disease. The disease occurs more often in men than in women, by reason of the fact that their occu- pations subject them, in a greater degree, to all sorts of injurious influences. More than half of all the cases (fifty-five per cent) occur in men who have passed their twentieth year of life. Arthritis Deformans; Arthritis Sicca. (Malum senile articulorum. Plate 45.) This insidious joint affection involves the synovial membrane, and both the cartilaginous and the bony structures; and it often -attacks several joints at the same time. The most important pathological altera- tions are proliferation of the synovial membrane; fibrillation and wearing away of the cartilage; prolif- eration of the latter to its margins, with some ten- dency to ossification (as a result of which a new pro- duction of bone, having the shape of a lip, surrounds the margin of the joint); and, finally, the grinding down of the surfaces of the joint, through the lack of their protecting cartilages. The inflamed synovial membrane produces villous growths (synovitis villosa or prolifera) or nodulated masses of tissue (arthro- meningitis tuberosa). The head of the femur under- goes atrophy, and a sort of collar of proliferated tissues forms around its margin, giving to it the shape of a vegetable fungus. In the larger joints a serous exudation (hydrarthros) will often be found,

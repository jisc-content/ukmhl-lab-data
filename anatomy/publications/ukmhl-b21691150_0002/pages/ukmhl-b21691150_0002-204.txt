86 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. of the disease and during the acute stage, that the mucous membrane of the anterior portion of the ure- thra is coated with pus, and that individual pus cor- puscles occupy the spaces between the flattened epithe- lial cells. Later on, desquamation of the epithelium takes place, and small cells infiltrate the subepithelial tissues. As a rule the inflammation does not extend beyond the superficial portions of the mucous mem- brane. The gonococci are found chiefly within the cells, imprisoned in leucocytes and epithelial cells, and pus cocci are often mingled with them. If the process becomes chronic in character (gleet), the pathological alterations will be found mainly in the membranous portion of the urethra. They are as follows: Proliferation of the epithelium, substan- tial losses of tissue, and mere erosions, which often in the process of healing develop cicatrices and thus cause a narrowing of the urethra (strictures). As further results of such strictures may be mentioned retention of urine, cystitis, hydronephrosis, and oc- casionally—in individuals of enfeebled constitution and advanced in years—pyelitis and pyelo-nephritis. In women the gonorrhoeal process is confined chiefly to the cervix uteri and the urethra, while the vagina, which is lined with an epithelium well adapted to resist the encroachments of the disease, participates in a more secondary fashion, through the irritation caused by the outflow of a purulent fluid from the uterus. The inflammatory and infectious process may extend to the glands of Bartholin, the mucous membrane of the body of the uterus, the Fallopian tubes, the ovaries, and the peritoneum. In men the disease may extend to the seminal vesicles, the pros-

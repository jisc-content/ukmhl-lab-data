ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 128 another a purulent or a fibrino-purulent fluid, and at still another a blood-stained fluid; only rarely—that is, when a communication exists between the perito- neal cavity and some neighboring organ—is the exu- dation an ichorous pus. The anatomical alterations are essentially the same as those observed in general peritonitis. Under the most favorable conditions, and especially in the milder forms of the disease, the inflammatory products are absorbed and an incom- plete return of the parts to a normal condition fol- lows; that is, adhesions form and a partial oblit- eration of the pelvic cavity takes place {adhesive pelveo-peritonitis). As a result of this condition there are apt to be dislocations of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes, and also flexions of the latter. The organized pseudo-membranes which have formed during such an inflammation, are at one time as delicate as a cob- web and easily torn, at another quite tough. The lining peritoneum is also often thickened and in places presents a lumpy appearance. In other cases the exudation becomes inspissated, and separate sac- culated foci of pus are formed (intraperitoneal pel- vic abscesses, retro-uterine pyocele). At such spots doughy swellings will be found, and fistulae are likely to follow their formation; the routes pursued by these fistulm following either an outward direction, through the skin, or one leading into one of the hollow viscera of the smaller pelvis (the intestine or the bladder). In extraperitoneal or retroperitoneal suppuration the term parametritis is employed when the inflam- mation localizes itself in the connective tissue in the neighborhood of the ligamenta lata and the vaginal portion of the uterus. The inflammatory process

URINARY APPARATUS. 79 place at the upper and posterior portion of the blad- der, is either complete (intraperitoneal) or incomplete (subperitoneal or extraperitoneal). The tear begins within and extends outward. When the rupture is incomplete the urine is extravasated into the cellular tissue lying in front of the bladder and between it and the peritoneum. The consequence is a septic peritonitis. When the rupture is complete, blood and the contents of the bladder escape into the ab- dominal cavity, and the patient exhibits the pallor of anaemia. Mechanical injuries of the bladder also occur not infrequently during labor and as a result of the vari- ous operations employed to aid in the delivery of the child. The ultimate results of these injuries are necrosis of the anterior or posterior wall of the blad- der, vesico-vaginal fistulse, and often pericystitis. Hemorrhages into the mucous membrane of the bladder are observed in the course of inflammations of this organ, in individuals affected with the hemor- rhagic diathesis, in cases of systemic poisoning, and in persons who are affected with villous tumors of the bladder or with enlarged veins about the neck of the organ (hemorrhoids of the bladder). Inflammation of the Bladder; Cystitis. There are both an acute and a chronic form of this disease, and the different degrees and modifications which are observed are numerous. In catarrhal cystitis the mucous membrane of the bladder is red and swollen, and in its cavity will be found an increased quantity of mucus and cast-off

221 THE BONES AND JOINTS. this bone fails, then, as a matter of course, to come in contact with the corresponding end of its opposite neighbor. In such a dislocation the outlines of the joint are altered—that is, the latter is deformed—and often the nerves and blood-vessels, as well as the soft parts in the neighborhood, are more or less injured. If, at the same time, there should be a fracture of the bone with a wound of the skin extending down to the seat of the fracture, it is customary to speak of the condition as a complicated fracture. In a favorable case, after the parts have been re- stored to their natural positions, a process of regen- eration sets in; the torn capsule heals, the effused blood is absorbed, and, at the end of from one to two weeks, the joint is once more able to perform its functions. In an unfavorable case, if the parts cannot be restored to their natural positions, a new joint forms on the head of the permanently dislocated bone; and, from the periosteum of the bone against which the latter rests, there is often developed a wall- like mass of new bone, which, in a somewhat imper- fect manner, supplies the requirements of a new joint socket (Plate 50). In rare cases a fibrous or bony ankylosis may take place; and when this happens the dislocated bone becomes firmly anchored to its new bed and to the surrounding parts by newly formed bone tissue or connective tissue. In what is known as habitual dislocation there seems to be a predisposition to frequent repetitions of this accident—oftentimes under very slight provocation. The reduction of the dislocation, in these cases, is generally an easy matter to accomplish. Among the causes of this habitual luxation may be mentioned

A genuine pathological and pre-senile form of atrophy of the uterus can develop from unknown causes (ex- cessive lactation?) during the puerperal period. In this form the organ will be found to have extremely thin walls, which may easily be perforated, while the vaginal portion projects like a small plug into the vagina. Inflammation of the Uterus. According to the regions in which the inflammation is localized it is customary to distinguish the follow- ing varieties: endometritis, metritis, perimetritis, and parametritis. Endometritis. This disease, which is one of the commonest to which the female sex is liable, is encountered in vari- ous forms and degrees of severity. Thus, for exam- ple, in accordance with the duration, we may distin- guish an acute, a subacute, and a chronic form; in accordance with the underlying cause, an infectious and a non-infectious form, a bacterial and a non-bac- terial form; and, finally, according to the nature of the exudation and the character of the inflammatory products, an exudative and a proliferative (or pro- ductive) form. There are also a puerperal and a non- puerperal variety of endometritis.

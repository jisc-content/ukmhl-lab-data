112 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. kypho-scoliosis accompanied by marked shortening of tlie spinal column—a pathological movable ante- version may result. The author has observed a num- ber of instances in which this pathological condition existed. Retroflexion of the Uterus.—In this condition the body of the uterus is bent backward, in such a man- ner that it forms a right angle with the cervix, while the fundus sinks down into Douglas’ cul-de-sac. The point where the bending occurs is in close prox- imity to the os internum. The movable variety of retroflexion of the uterus produces as a rule insignifi- cant symptoms; while, on the other hand, the adhe- sive or fixed form—that in which the organ is bound down by connective-tissue pseudo-membranes—is of a more serious nature. This form of retroflexion is par- ticularly apt to occur as a sequel to childbirth, when the uterus is large and heavy and the tissues in the neighborhood of the os internum are relaxed. Further- more, it also sometimes occurs (with or without de- scent of the organ) when excessive abdominal pressure is indulged in too often, and when intestinal hernia develops after the occurrence of numerous labors. Retroversion of the uterus is a condition in which the fundus of this organ lies as if it had fallen over back- ward, while the outer orifice (os externum) looks toward the symphysis pubis. Descent and Prolapse of the Uterus. In simple descent the uterus occupies a lower posi- tion than it normally does; the highest part of the vagina being folded in, and the os externum lying in the space between the vulvse.

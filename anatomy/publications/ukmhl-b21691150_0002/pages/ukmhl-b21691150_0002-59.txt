Explanation of Plate 15. Tuberculosis of the Testicle. In the enlarged testicle may be seen two cheesy foci of considerable size. A broad bridge of parenchyma, which is also undergoing cheesy degeneration, is the only barrier between the two centres of softening. The larger of these has begun to break down, while in the smaller one the change has already advanced far enough to es- tablish, at one end, the conditions of a cavity filled with fluid. These areas of disease are rather sharply sepa- rated from the surrounding healthy parts by walls of a tissue which is of an opaque yellowish color, easily broken down, and yet of fairly firm consistence. In ad- dition to these lesions evidences of cheesy tuberculosis were found in the corresponding spermatic cord, in the seminal vesicles, in the prostate, in the neck of the urinary bladder, and in the right ureter, as well as in the pelvis and surrounding parenchyma of the right kidney (see Plate 12). The case, therefore, was one of genito-urinary tuberculosis, which doubtless began in the right kidney and spread downward from there to the different organs—which have been enumerated above — of the urinary and sexual apparatuses. The patient, a young man about twenty-five years of age, was very much emaciated. The causes of his death were: Acute tuberculous basilar meningitis, of which no symptoms had manifested themselves during his lifetime; chronic tuber- culosis of the lungs; and ulcerating tuberculosis of the larynx and intestines.

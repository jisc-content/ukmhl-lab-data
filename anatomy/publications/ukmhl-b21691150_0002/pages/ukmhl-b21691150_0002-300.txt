182 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. The hemorrhages which occur in the spinal cord are generally of traumatic origin, and are encoun- tered with special frequency in the gray matter; within which the escaping blood, as it spreads, assumes the shape of a tube. This condition has been termed a central hcemato-myelia. Hemorrhages of this nature may take place even as early as during the birth of the child, and may thus give rise, at some later date, to a syringomyelia. Among the traumatic affections of the spinal cord concussion of this organ plays an important part. Out of such a concussion a variety of anomalous con- ditions may develop. Thus, for example, it may in- duce a simple necrosis of one portion of the nervous structures of the cord; the breaking down of these elements taking place gradually, and the interstitial tissue either remaining unaffected or else manifesting a secondary proliferative tendency. In a second group of cases both the nervous elements and the supporting framework may undergo necrosis at the same time (a lesion of the cord in transverse section, with diffuse softening), while later there will be secondary degen- erations and cavities will form. In a third group, circumscribed foci of necrosis establish themselves in the cordâ€”foci which are similar in character to the embolic centres of softening in the brain, and which end in forming simple cavities. Finally, in a fourth group the two pathological processes of gliosis and cavity formation (syringomyelia) are brought into activity, in very much the same way as happens in the formation of a tumor through traumatic influ- ences. The development of cavities is brought about by the destruction of neuroglia. In punctured wounds

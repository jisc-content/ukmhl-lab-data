ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 70 affairs exists, it is proper to designate it by the term cystoid degeneration of the kidney. Such cystic kid- neys are observed in the newborn, and they may be acquired at some later period of life. When they are of congenital origin, these kidneys may be of such a large size as to constitute in a pregnant woman a se- rious obstacle to the birth of the child. A fcetal in- flammation and obliteration of the papilhe (Virchowâ€™s foetal papillitis) is believed by some to be the cause of this cystoid degeneration. It is also possible that the condition may be really one of embryonal cyst- adenomata. Among the non-malignant tumors which are encoun- tered in the kidneys there are, aside from the rarely occurring fibromata and lipomata, certain growths which develop from misplaced germinal portions of the suprarenal capsules (struma renis aberrata, struma suprarenalis). These tumors are situated in the cor- tical substance, and project like hemispheres above the surface of the organ. They have a whitish-yellow color and a soft, marrow-like consistence; their boun- daries are sharply defined, and they evidently grow very slowly. When examined under the microscope these tumors are seen to consist of fat-containing cells arranged like a network, the structure resembling closely that of the cortex of the suprarenal capsule; or, in other words, that of alveolar adenomata which are in part provided with papillae. The rhabdomy- oma, which rarely comes under observation, is also of embryonic origin. Of the malignant tumors the sarcomas are seen oftenest. They occur in all their different varieties: round-celled, spindle-celled, and large-celled sarco-

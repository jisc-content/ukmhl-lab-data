204 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. In many cases there will develop, e.g., on the ster- num or on the ribs, a tuberculous periostitis and osteitis; and in such cases the disease can be traced to a tuberculosis of some neighboring organ (pleura or lymph glands), from which it has spread to the new locality by direct continuity. In a similar manner a primary tuberculosis of a joint may spread by direct continuity to the neighboring bone structures. An ossifying periostitis is often associated with tuberculous disease of bone, and in that event—as happens in purulent osteomyelitis and osteitis—it is very likely to produce an outside casing of bone, in which there are one or more fistulous openings that afford an outlet to the more deeply situated pus. A spontaneous cure of a tuberculous bone caries takes place rarely. It may be greatly promoted, however, by surgical interference—by the removal of sequestra and diseased tissues. The term spina ventosa is employed to designate a form of fungous osteomyelitis (also of a tuberculous nature) which, as a local process, often primarily at- tacks the short tubular bones of the extremities (the phalanges). In these cases the entire shaft of the bone is involved. The production of granulation tis- sue in the marrow is associated with a breaking down of the central bone substance and with a certain de- gree of expansion of the bone, which often becomes as thin as paper and eventually disappears altogether. Thus an escape is provided for the accumulated cheesy and purulent masses.

Explanation of Plate 14. Multiple Tar and Paraffin Workersâ€™ Cancer of the Scrotum. (After Volkmann.) Several roundish cancerous outgrowths upon the sur- face of the scrotum. The smaller ones have elevated wall-like margins, while the larger one (close alongside the glans penis) presents small nodules and is fissured. On the upper surface of the penis is seated a horny cancerous growth about as large as a bean. The patient, a man about forty-nine years of age, showed evidences of the disease after he had worked for eleven years in tar and paraffin manufactories. Cured by operation.

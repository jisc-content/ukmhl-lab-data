Fetid extrapuerperal endometritis, which is associ- ated with the pouring out of an exudation of ichorous pus, develops now and then in elderly women. Tuberculosis of the Uterus. (Plate 18.) Tuberculosis of the uterus rarely occurs as a pri- mary disease, but it is quite often encountered as a secondary manifestation, in association with some other diseaseâ€”generally with tuberculosis of the Fal- lopian tubes. The tuberculous infection of the female genital tract occurs either through some external agency (as from connection with a man who is suffer- ing from tuberculosis, and especially from tuberculous disease of the genito-urinary organs, or from an ex- ternal self-infection) or by an extension of the disease from the Fallopian tubes (peritoneum), or else by way of the blood circulation. The genital tuberculosis of women is usually a descending disease; that is, it ex- tends downward from the Fallopian tubes to the mu- cous membrane of the uterus. Whereas in the male sex the genital tuberculosis is very often associated with tuberculous disease of the urinary apparatus, in women the two almost never occur together. As seen in actual practice tuberculosis of the uterus usually presents itself in the form of a rather sluggish cheesy inflammation of the mucous membrane (sub- acute or chronic cheesy endometritis). At the com- mencement the internal surface of the uterus is cov-

Kryptorchismus is the result of the persistent fail- ure of the testicles to descend from the abdominal cavity. The condition is one which occurs more often on one side (monorchismus) than on both, and it is also characterized by incomplete development of the testicle and by azoospermia. The imperfectly developed testicle is generally to be found lying in the inguinal canal (inguinal testicle), and it is further distinguished by the fact that it is specially prone to be the seat of malignant growths, such as sarcoma and carcinoma.

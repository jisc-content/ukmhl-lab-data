When, through a long series of generations, either no demands at all or only slight ones are made upon these glands, they become defective in their develop- ment and functionally atrophied; and this condition may then be transmitted regularly from mother to child.* The striking predisposition which the mam- mary gland manifests to become the seat of all sorts of benign and malignant new growths must surely have some connection with this degenerative hypo- plasia. And in this respect the gland shows some similarity to the imperfectly developed, functionally useless, non-descended testicle lodged in the inguinal canal, inasmuch as malignant new growths show a special predilection for this organ when placed under the conditions named. Atrophy of the mammary gland is sometimes ob- served in general cachexia, and also in general obesity (in which latter condition an excessive development of fat and defective functional power characterize the “fleshy breasts”—the term which is commonly ap- plied to them under these circumstances). A physi- ological atrophy takes place during the climacteric years, and then a compensatory development of fat {ex vacuo) makes good the loss due to the wasting away of the gland. * In Germany it has been found that on the average only from one-half to two-thirds of all the women who give birth to a child are able to provide it with sufficient milk from their own breasts for a period of ten days (!) ; and only thirty per cent of the women can do this for a period of half a year.

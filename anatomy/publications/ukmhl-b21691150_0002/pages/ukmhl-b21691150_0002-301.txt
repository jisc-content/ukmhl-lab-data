NERVOUS APPARATUS. 183 of the spinal eorcl an cedematous swelling of the adja- cent parts invariably follows, and in this way a certain number of nerve fibres are for a short time function- ally disabled. After the swelling has subsided the affected nerve paths, or at least a part of them, re- sume their functional activity. Traumatic influences are also responsible for those meningeal hemorrhages which are localized either in or between the membranes (intrameningeal apoplexies), and which, like a mantle, envelop the spinal cord. Such extramedullary hemorrhages may also take their rise from some point at the base of the brainâ€” as a result, for example, of a spontaneous rupture of an aneurism situated in this locality. A hemorrhage like this is termed a descending spinal meningeal apoplexy. Compression Myelitis. (Plate 37.) Degenerative Atrophy of the Spinal Cord due to Compression. Compression of the spinal cord owes its origin, in the majority of instances, to some disease of the spi- nal column (such as tuberculous spondylitis, with ca- ries and necrosis; fractures and luxations, and new growths, of the bones) or of its membranes (inflam- matory processes of a suppurative, syphilitic, or tuberculous nature; new growths); or it may be brought about by the development of a new growth in the substance of the spinal cord itself. As a gen- eral rule the spinal cord is able to bear, without any perceptible bad effects, a very considerable degree of

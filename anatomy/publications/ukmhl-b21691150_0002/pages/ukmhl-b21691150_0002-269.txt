NERVOUS APPARATUS. 151 Pachymeningitis Purulenta. According to the localization of the disease upon the outer or upon the inner surface of the dura, it is customary to apply to it the name of external puru- lent pachymeningitis or that of internal purulent pachy- meningitis. The external variety usually develops as a secondary disease, after some injury to the bony walls of the cranial cavity, and especially after an injury to the vault of the cranium, with infection of the wound. It may also develop through an exten- sion of the inflammation from some point in the neighborhood; and it is particularly apt to follow an otitis media purulenta or a caries of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone. While it is true that an external pachymeningitis (associated with a partial separation of the dura from the inner surface of the skull cap) is encountered, as a rule, only as a cir- cumscribed disease, nevertheless such a purulent in- flammation of the inner surface may extend until it involves large areas of the internal surface of the dura. If an infectious process happens to be located in the immediate neighborhood of the wall of one of the sinuses, it is an easy matter for a secondary sep- tic endophlebitis, with thrombosis (secondary septic thrombo-phlebitis), to develop; and, as a matter of fact, this complication, in the case of the transverse sinus, at the point where it passes over the posterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, is often observed. Syphilitic inflammation of the dura mater—pachy- meningitis gummosa—occurs with special frequency

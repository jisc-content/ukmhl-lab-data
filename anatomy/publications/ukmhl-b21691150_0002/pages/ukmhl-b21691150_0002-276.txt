Then there is another alteration which, in this more advanced stage of the disease, will be likely to attract our attention, viz., the presence, in the lymph sheaths of the finer arteries, of very small nodules—some of them scarcely visible, while others are as large as the head of a pin—which have an opaque centre. It will also be observed at the same time that, in the vicinity of the fossse of Sylvius, the cerebral cortex is more seriously involved, for in this region it is congested, swollen, and in many portions full of small miliary hemorrhagic foci or apoplexies, all these lesions indicating the existence of a meningo- encephalitis. Through the spreading of the inflam- mation, by way of the cerebral fissure, over the plexus of veins and the ependyma of the ventricles, a serous exudation, rich in cellular elements, may be expected to take place into the cerebral ventricles (inflamma- tory hydrocephalus interims). These ventricles under- go speedy enlargement—sometimes to three or four times their normal size, and the enlargement of these cavities is particularly marked in the case of the an- tei’ior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, which may attain the size of a hen’s egg, or an even larger size. Numerous leucocytes will be found in the fluid contained in such abundance in the ventricles. The basal and central portions of the brain which bor- der upon the ventricles are often also highly oedema- tous, and sometimes softened to the consistence of

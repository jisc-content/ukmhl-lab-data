After the bone has been subjected to the toxic influence of the phos- phorus, a septic infection must then first take place before it can become necrosed. Whereas formerly the mortality from phosphorus necrosis was very large (from twenty-five to fifty per cent), it is now possible in almost every case to effect a cure provided early operative measures be resorted to and the necrosed bone be all removed. New Growths of the Bony Structures. (Plates 48 and 49 and Figs. 11-15). Malignant growths of all kinds—particularly can- cer and sarcoma—occur in bone, either through me- tastasis or as a secondary manifestation. Now and then a case is seen in which the bone marrow and the bone tissue itself are infiltrated with genuine cancer elements; and when this happens the bone becomes bent and deformed in very much the same way as it does in osteomalacia. This condition has been desig- nated as an osteomalacia carcinomatosa. Now and then the bone becomes involved secondarily by the advance of the destructive new growth, from some point near by, into the bone structure. Cancerous disintegration of the bone soon follows. This sort of invasion is apt to occur in cases of cancer of the skin (on the face and on the extremities; see Plate 49), or of sarcoma involving some portion of the cavity of the mouth or the gums. In such cases the bones of the jaw often undergo partial destruction. Among the primary new growths which develop in

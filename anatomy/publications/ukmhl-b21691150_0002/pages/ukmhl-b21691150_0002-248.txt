According to the situation occupied by the tumor it is customary to distinguish three different varieties, viz., the subserous or subperitoneal, the interstitial, and the submucous myomata. 1. The subserous or subperitoneal myomata (Fig. 5) are often pedunculate; they frequently cause changes in posi- tion and dislocations of the uterus. 2. The inter- Fig. 5.—Intramural Myomata of the Uterus. These growths have begun their development in the body of the uterus. One of the larger ones— originally an intramural myoma—is now growing in the direction of the cavity of the uterus, and has already become submucous in character. Two others, growing in an outward direction, are already pushing up the peritoneal covering of the organ, and are making their existence appre- ciable from the outside as subserous myomata. The mucous membrane of the uterus is thickened. stitial myomata (intraparietal or intramural myomata) may, as their growth progresses, become converted into the subserous or the submucous variety. 3. The submucous myomata are usually less bulky than either of the other varieties. They are not infre- quently pedunculate and they resemble the ordinary polypi to a certain extent (they should be termed

THE BONES AND JOINTS. 229 and become converted into connective tissue, and finally the joint heals, but with a permanent fibrous or bony ankylosis. As a result of the swelling of the soft parts in the neighborhood, the joint (knee or elbow) often presents the shape of a spindle. This appearance is also doubtless favored by the atrophy which takes place in the neighboring muscles, through lack of use. In another group of cases the inflammation extends to the capsule of the joint, to the peri-articular con- nective tissue, and also to the skin covering these parts; and, when the latter is affected, it may show a great variety of secondary inflammatory alterations. Thus, for example, it becomes thin, smooth, and glossy (tumor albus; white swelling), and is often pierced by fistulous openings which afford escape to a thin abnormally colored pus. Tuberculous joint disease is almost always a sec- ondary disease of metastatic origin (due to haemato- genous auto-infection). It develops from some older tuberculous disease located in the lungs, the lymph glands, or some other organ; it may also develop secondarily to a tuberculous synovitis or to a synovial form of tuberculous arthritis which was not preceded by tuberculous disease of the bone; or, finally—and this is more apt to be the case—it is a tertiary patho- logical phenomenon, due to the extension of a tuber- culous osteitis (in circumscribed foci) from the neigh- boring bone to the joint (osteal variety of tuberculous osteitis). The primary and idiopathic occurrence of articular tuberculosis is au exceptional event. As regards the relative frequency with which the different joints are affected, it can only be said that

ATLAS OP PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 138 faces may afford an entrance to septic germs, and in this way a general puerperal infection may take place. As a result of the necrosis of certain areas of tissue which have been subjected to excessive pressure dur- ing the birth of the child, abnormal communications are often established between the vagina and neigh- boring organs (the bladder and the rectum, for ex- ample) . In this way are developed the pathological conditions known as vesico-vaginal fistula, recto-vagi- nal fistula, and vesico-recto-vaginal fistula. New Growths.—Carcinoma is rarely seen as a pri- mary growth in the vagina, and then usually in the form of a superficial cancer. On the other hand, it often develops in this locality as a secondary mani- festation; and in that case it will generally appear first in the upper and posterior portion of the vagina —that is, at the spot which a uterine cancer would naturally reach first in its downward growth. Even- tually there will be found in this region, in the place of the vault of the vagina and of the vaginal portion of the uterus, a veritable cavern whose walls, which are infiltrated with the cancerous growth, pour forth an ichorous pus. In a few instances a primary can- cer develops in the labia, the varieties observed be-ing the papillary, the superficial, and the deep-seated cancers. Benign papillary epitheliomata are found both at the entrance to the vagina and on the labia, and particularly often in connection with a preceding gonorrhoeal colpitis and urethritis. These growths are the so-called pointed condylomata. In the tissues of the labia connective-tissue tumors {soft fibromata) sometimes develop. At the start they appear to have simply an inflammatory character.

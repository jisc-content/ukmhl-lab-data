227 THE BONES AND JOINTS. a delicate sediment, of a white or milky-white color, had been disseminated throughout its substance. In the severe cases, and in those in which the process has been increasing in severity through a long series of years, this deposit may so increase in quantity as to form knobbed masses (tophi) of a mortar-like or chalk-like material. In the latter event the soft parts covering these masses grow thinner and thinner, until finally the skin gives way and permits at least a part of the pathological concretions to escape spontane- ously. The articular surfaces of the bones which compose a joint are not the only parts in which such deposits take place; the enveloping capsule and the adjacent tissues may also become similarly affected. Now and then, in these gouty patients, one finds at the same time evidences of a chronic atrophic nephri- tis urica (“gouty kidney”). Among the causes which favor the development of the disease should be men- tioned an inherited predisposition, chilling of the body, and high living. Tuberculous Arthritis. (Plate 52.) Whereas miliary tubercles, unaccompanied by in- flammatory alterations, rarely develop in the synovial membrane, tuberculous disease of the other joint struc- tures—which is characterized, in the great majority of cases, by a tendency on the one hand to produce an exudation (partly free, and partly organized), and on the other to cause destruction of tissue—is by no means a rare occurrence. Tuberculous disease of a joint usually begins—as

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 118 A rupture is said to be complete when the tear ex- tends through all the layers, and incomplete when it extends only part way through the wall of the uterus. The relation between the complete and the incomplete is as 100 to 8. Among the secondary results may be mentioned subperitoneal hemorrhage and the pouring out of blood into the abdominal cavity. In addition to the spontaneous ruptures there are those which are due to the employment of violent therapeutic meas- ures, both manual and instrumental, and those which result from some mechanical force acting from with- out, such as a fall, a blow, etc. These latter occur rarely. Healing and cicatrization of the ruptured uterus are results which do not often take place. Operative interference now and then brings about this favorable result. In the majority of cases (ninety-five per cent), however, death soon follows, either as a result of hemorrhage or through secondary septic infec- tion. Rupture of the uterus occurs about seven times oftener in women who have already previ- ously given birth to children than among those who are passing through their first labor. Atrophy of the Uterus. A physiological atrophy of the uterus—if we except the puerperal involution of this organ—occurs only after the menopause has been reached. In this con- dition the uterus shows a diminution in size in all its diameters, and a marked shrinking of the vaginal portion. After the operation of spaying, and also as a result of inflammatory granular atrophy (sclero-

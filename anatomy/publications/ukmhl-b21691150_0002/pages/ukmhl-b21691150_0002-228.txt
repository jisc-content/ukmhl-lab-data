ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 110 nancy, in its narrower sense, is applied. The third variety, which is termed tubo-abdominal pregnancy, is of very great rarity; for, as a matter of fact, the cases which are generally believed to belong in this category are really cases of misinterpreted tubal or abdominal pregnancy. Very often—perhaps even in a majority of instances •—the abdominal and ovarian varieties commence orig- inally as a tubal pregnancy. In the majority of cases (seventy per cent) of extra- uterine (ectopic) pregnancy either a tubal abortion (that is, an expulsion of the ovum through the ab- dominal mouth of the Fallopian tube) or a rupture of the foetal sac takes place during the first three months. Various results may follow: as, for example, the death of the embryo and the absorption of its com- ponent elements; the formation of a lisematoma be- hind the uterus (retro-uterine hrematocele) when the rupture takes place into the abdominal cavity, or the development of this same lesion in the substance of the broad ligament when the hemorrhage occurs at this point; or a fatal issue may result from internal hemorrhage; or the embryo may go on developing up to full maturity of foetal life, and may then be de- livered by means of operative interference; or the embryo may die and become converted into a litho- psedion; or, finally, suppuration may take place in the foetal sac, and the abscess may break into some neighboring organ (bladder or intestine).

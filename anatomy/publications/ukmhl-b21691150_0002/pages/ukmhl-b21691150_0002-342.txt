ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 224 joint cavities of the affected joints, should be classed rather as cases of septic polyarthritis. Suppurative Arthritis. This disease occurs very rarely as a primary affec- tion, and when it does it is as a part of a septico- pysemia of cryptogenous origin. It is more often a secondary disease, of metastatic and hsematogenous origin. It occurs, for example, in the course of a puerperal septicaemia, and in ulcerating septic endo- carditis ; or it may follow an attack of scarlet fever or gonorrhoea. The villi of the synovial membrane ap- pear, in this disease, to be infiltrated with cells; and, when the inflammation is intense, both the endothe- lium and the cartilage perish through processes of necrosis. In the cavity of the joint a varying quan- tity of whitish, creamy pus will be found. In many cases the inflammation spreads to the neighboring tissues, that is, to the peri-articular connective tissue, and there sets up a suppurative peri-arthritis. This suppurative form of arthritis may also develop from an injury to the joint of such a character as to lay it open to the air; and finally it may originate from neighboring bone disease, as is likely to happen when a purulent osteitis or osteomyelitis is going on in the vicinity of the joint. It is then termed an osteo- genous arthritis. The disease rarely terminates in a cure. The artic- ular ends of the bones, being robbed of their cartilage, begin to develop granulation tissue. It grows out from the synovial membrane and from the bone mar- row, and unites with the granulation tissue which

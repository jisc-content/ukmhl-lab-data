121 SEXUAL APPARATUS. importance are tears and bruises of the mucous mem- brane, inasmuch as these serve as points of entrance for the septic micro-organisms, which invade the tis- sues and multiply within them. This is particularly apt to happen after difficult labors (contracted pelvis, instrumental delivery), and also in those cases in which still-adherent remains of the placenta and foetal membranes, or tears of the cervical portion of the uterus, offer favorable points where the agents which give rise to infection may effect a lodgement. After the initial stages of the inflammation (swelling, hypersemia, and increased secretion of a fluid mixed with blood) have quickly passed away, the mucous membrane—in the more serious and the fatal cases— seems to undergo a conversion into a dirty gray or a grayish-yellow mass of the consistence of tinder. This change is especially noticeable at the points where the placenta had been attached or where a tear had occurred, at wffiich places discolored eschars may be seen. The contents of the uterus consist of a bad- smelling, abnormal-looking fluid, composed of altered blood, pus, and cast-off masses of dead tissue. As a rule, those cases which end in death manifest a ten- dency, on the part of the uterine tissues, to undergo necrotic changes. We may speak of them as cases of ichorous endometritis, a disease in which well- marked putrefactive changes may, in some instances, be observed in the uterus. As is true of septic and infectious processes generally, there is a tendency in puerperal endometritis to spread to neighboring parts. In some cases the disease spreads by way of the lymph spaces (as in the case of erysipelatous and phlegmonous metritis), while in others it follows

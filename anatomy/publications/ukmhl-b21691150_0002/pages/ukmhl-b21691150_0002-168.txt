Explanation of Plate 52. Tuberculous Fungous Inflammation of the Knee- Joint (Gonarthritis) . The knee-joint presents the condition of a fungous synovitis. The cavity of the joint contains a moderate quantity of thin pus, mixed with flakes of fibrin. The larger part of the synovial membrane is covered with grayish-red, succulent, sarcoma-like, spongy granula- tions, which in some places measure half a centimetre, or even more, in thickness. Scattered throughout these rather low, hummocky products of inflammation, which under the microscope present the picture of a granulation tissue rich in cells, there are tuberculous nodules, which appear, even to the unaided eye, as prominent, opaque- yellow, nodular growths. The cartilage tissue which covers the patella and the epiphysis of the femur remains almost entirely intact, owing to the fact that the process is of comparatively recent date.

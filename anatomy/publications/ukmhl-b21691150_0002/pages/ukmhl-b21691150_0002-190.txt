ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 72 in this manner. This mobility is to be attributed to an abnormally large and relaxed capsule, and at the same time the blood-vessels which furnish a certain stability to the kidney will be found to have under- gone more or less stretching and elongation. In its posterior portion the diaphragm protrudes forward, almost in the form of a sac, into the peritoneal cavity. The dislocated kidney lies somewhere between the second and the fifth lumbar vertebrae. When, as is commonly the case, the right kidney is the one dislo- cated downward and forward, one can feel it just below the lower border of the liver. Among the sequelae of this pathological condition may be mentioned the fol- lowing : stretching and bending of the ureters and the renal nerves, and pressure upon the intestines at dif- ferent points. The wandering kidney, which in its slighter degrees is of common occurrence and scarcely gives rise to any appreciable disturbances, is encoun- tered at post-mortem examinations with surprising infrequency. In addition to congenital predisposition the follow- ing may be mentioned as the chief causes of a mis- placed kidney, a condition which is often associated with enteroptosis and which is observed mainly in women, and more espepially in those who have reached the middle and later years of life: Belaxa- tion of the abdominal parietes, pressure exerted by. the adjacent liver, badly fitting clothing (for exam- ple, a too tightly laced corset), repeated pregnancies, and disappearance of the subperitoneal fat (as after certain severe illnesses).

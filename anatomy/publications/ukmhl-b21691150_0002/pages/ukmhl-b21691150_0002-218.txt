100 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 2. Among the solid tumors of the ovaries the sarco- mata are the most frequently encountered. They vary in size from that of a hen’s egg to that of a man’s head, and often they involve both ovaries. Two varieties are distinguished: the spindle-cell and the round-cell sarcoma. These tumors possess a rather firm consistence and are of a whitish color. On section the cut surface presents a glistening and moist appearance. Quite recently cases of angio- sarcoma (endothelioma) of the ovaries have been re- ported. Formerly it was the custom to reckon among the cancerous growths those medullary sarcomata which are only rarely observed in children. Of the sarcomatous tumors found in the ovaries many are of a mixed character; as, for example, fibro-sarco- mata, adeno-sarcomata (from cystadenomata), and sarcoma carcinomatodes. Secondary sarcomatosis of the ovaries is of rare oc- currence. When this change takes place it is usually as a sequence to sarcomatosis and fibro-sarcomatosis of the peritoneum. Epithelial Tumors. Malignant tumors of epithelial origin are rarely observed in the ovaries. Now and then one of meta- static origin is seen. The scirrhous and the medul- lary varieties are the ones which are commonly ob- served in this organ, but in very rare instances a gelatinous cancer may be found. Generally the en- tire ovary is swallowed up in the tumor, and some- times both ovaries completely disappear in this manner. It often happens that a carcinoma develops

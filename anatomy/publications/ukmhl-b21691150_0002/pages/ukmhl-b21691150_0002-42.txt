Explanation of Plate 10. Cystic Kidney. Fig. a.—The external capsule contains very little fat, and the fibrous capsule can be separated from the organ itself only with difficulty. Both kidneys are very much reduced in size, and on their outer surfaces may be seen numerous transparent and thin-walled cysts of vari- ous sizes (from that of a hempseed to that of a cherry). Their contents are in some instances a clear, amber- colored fluid, in others a dark reddish fluid. In a sec- tion of the organ it can be seen that all through the pa- renchyma, which is in a high degree atrophic, there are numerous rather small cysts. At the liilus there is an abundant development of fat (ex vacuo). In the patient—a man seventy-two years old and highly emaciated—the following lesions were also found: Brown atrophy of the heart, pulmonary emphysema, and extensive calcification of the retroperitoneal and mesen- teric lymph glands (healed tuberculosis). (No. 445, 1895.) Coral-Shaped Calculus from the Pelvis of the Kidney. Fig. b.— The specimen was taken from a man, sixty- two years of age, who had died of purulent ascending pyelo-nephritis. A similar calculus was found in the other kidney. Both kidneys enlarged; cysts scattered everywhere throughout the tissues, which are much atro- phied; medulla and cortex greatly narrowed; papillm shortened; weight of both kidneys reduced to one-half of the normal weight; pelvis of both kidneys dilated; and mucous membrane thickened and covered with an opaque purulent fluid. Both ureters markedly dilated, and their lining mucous membrane swollen, discolored (a bluish-gray), and smeared with a thickisli pus. In the urinary bladder there was a little fluid of a greenish color and somewhat resembling pus; and besides this there were two stones about the size of hen’s eggs, shaped

54 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL AHATOHY. tive-tissue framework increase in bulk, and the veins and capillaries become dilated, but there will also be a certain amount of inflammatory action—a limited glomerulitis—terminating in atrophy. In the midst of the tissue, which has become cyanotic and indu- rated, there will be found, in the cortical region, scat- tered areas in which the tissues have undergone atro- phy as the result of an antecedent inflammation; while at the same time the medullary substance, itself also in an indurated condition, presents evidences of a diffuse atrophy. The dark-colored and tough kid- ney, whose surface is studded with slightly elevated nodules, grows smaller and smaller. This is the con- gested and contracted kidney shown in Plate 1. Now and then it will be found that the cyanotic hue of the diseased kidney has become very much paler. This is especially true of individuals whose fundamental disease (some form of heart affection) has terminated in a general anaemia and cachexia of long duration. We may accordingly speak of a granular atrophy of the kidney, which develops from a cyanotic indura- tion, and is often mistaken for the true contracted kidney. The granules at first are of a darker color- ing; at a later stage, however, they present a pale appearance, but yet they do not lose entirely their livid hue. The most important alterations in this variety of contracted and congested kidney are the following: Dilatation of the capillaries and veins; thickening of the walls of the capillaries; pressure atrophy of numerous uriniferous canaliculi; atrophy of glomeruli with thickening of their capsules; and thickening of the walls of the blood-vessels (the in- tima being involved only in the case of arteries, while

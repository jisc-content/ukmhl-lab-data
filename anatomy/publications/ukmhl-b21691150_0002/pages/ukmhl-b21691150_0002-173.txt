55 URINARY APPARATUS. the adventitia may be thickened in both the arteries and the veins). Among the functional disturbances which accom- pany this form of congested kidneys may be men- tioned diminution of the quantity of urine excreted, increased specific gravity, formation of an abundant sediment, slight albuminuria, and the occasional presence of a few hyaline casts in the urine. In that form of nephritis which is due to venous congestion of the organ, epithelial casts and red blood corpuscles will also be found in large numbers in the urine. Ancemia of the kidneys is found as an accompani- ment of general anaemia. The pale gray color which characterizes this condition is found either to extend uniformly throughout the kidney or to be confined to the cortex. In certain parenchymatous inflamma- tions which pursue a chronic course, there will gen- erally be found, in addition to the pale aspect due to anaemia, a certain amount of fatty degeneration. (The so-called large white kidney is an instance of this.) In fatty and amyloid degeneration the kidney is indeed ansemic, but it is also at the same time enlarged and presents a more spotted appearance. Hemorrhages in the Kidneys.—These are often to be demonstrated only by aid of the microscope. They are a common occurrence in acute inflammations of the kidneys (hemorrhagic nephritis) and in the gen- eral condition termed “hemorrhagic diathesis.” If the blood which has escaped from the vessels is con- fined inside the Malpighian capsules, the latter will appear as small red dots scattered uniformly through- out the cortex. But when the blood escapes into the uriniferous canaliculi, the appearance presented will

The contracted kidney of secondary development (in contradistinction to the “ genuine contracted kidney”) is encountered much more rarely. It develops from forms of kidney inflammation which at first run an acute, subacute, or subchronic course, and involve mainly the parenchyma. Thus, for example, a ne- crotic process involving the epithelial structures may lead to secondary interstitial nephritis atrophicans. A smooth or only slightly granular form of contracted kidney sometimes develops—although rarely, it must be confessed—from the large white kidney. The pathological process which takes place in these cases, and which extends uniformly throughout the paren- chyma of the kidney, gives rise to a correspondingly uniform and widespread atrophy, or at the most to a slightly granular surface of the organ. In this same category also belongs the slightly granular contracted kidney which is associated with a condition of chronic congestion—a form of pathological kidney which is often mistaken for the genuine contracted kidney. The arteriosclerotic contracted kidney, which is ob- served in persons of an advanced age (beyond the sixtieth year), and frequently even in younger in- dividuals who are affected with a syphilitic endar- teritis, also presents certain points of resemblance to the genuine contracted kidney. It is in this variety that the very first alterations are to be looked for in the walls of the smallest arterioles (obliterating arte- ritis). Furthermore, on the surface of the kidney shallow, irregularly shaped depressions (due to cica- tricial contraction) may often be seen; and in the

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 106 same. They may be due to various causes, such as changes in the position of the uterus and ovaries, and connective-tissue adhesions in the true pelvis (adhe- sive pelveo-peritonitis). Narrowing and closure of the tubes are often the re- sult of catarrhal changes, and also of closure of the abdominal opening through peritonitic adhesions. At the uterine orifice the tube may become narrowed by the encroachment of a tumor of the uterus. Fi- nally, changes in the position of the tube itself may cause bending of the same and a narrowing of its calibre. Hydrosalpinx. (Plate 20.) As a result of closure of the abdominal orifice the secretions in the tube accumulate and cause dilatation first of the lateral portion and then gradually of the entire tube. Thus dilated the tube becomes filled with a clear, watery fluid (retention drops}'), and may attain the size of a manâ€™s finger or thumb. It also, as a result of the dilatation, assumes the shape of an elongated tortuous sac, not unlike a sausage or a portion of the intestines. Furthermore, owing to the presence of transverse folds which project from the walls of the tube into its interior, there will be formed a series of cavities, which follow one after the other in a row, like the beads of a rosary. When hydrosalpinx develops on both sides, sterility is sure to be the result.

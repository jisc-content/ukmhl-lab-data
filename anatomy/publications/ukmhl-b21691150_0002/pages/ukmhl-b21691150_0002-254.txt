136 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. of worms (oxyuris) wliicli have found their way in from the rectum. The mucous membrane, while pre- senting the usual inflammatory alterations (such as redness and swelling), will also be found to be cov- ered with a mucous or a purulent secretion, and often the urethral mucous membrane and that of the cervix of the uterus present evidences of having par- ticipated in the inflammation. In a few cases ab- scesses of the glands of Bartholin constitute an ac- companiment of the disease. During the lying-in period the inflammation of the vagina often assumes, as a result of the processes of a similar nature which are going on in the endometrium, a diphtheroid char- acter; that is, it produces an ichorous pus, and is characterized by the casting off of veritable sloughs from such spots as have been injured. Under these circumstances there is danger of a secondary infec- tious pericolpitis, a parametritis, a peritonitis, and even of a general septic infection. Chronic colpitis (chronic vaginal catarrh, fluor albus, leucorrhoea) either grows out of some acute inflamma- tory process, or else it develops in a primary manner, in women who for any reason are in a weakened and run-down condition. An excessive desquamation of epithelial cells and the formation of exceedingly fine villus-like granulations (colpitis granulosa) give to the moderately reddened mucous membrane a cloudy and velvety appearance. There is also such a thing as a fibrous and adhesive colpitis. It is generally associated with some injury or loss of substance, and it is likely to result in narrowing or atresia of the vagina.

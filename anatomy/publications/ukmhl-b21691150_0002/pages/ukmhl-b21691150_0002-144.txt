Explanation of Plate 44. Chronic Ossifying Osteomyelitis of the Tibia, with Partial Necrosis of the Bone. The medullary cavity is only at one or two spots, par- ticularly in the middle part of the bone, still distinctly recognizable. Everywhere else a spongy and in some places sclerotic mass of bone has developed in its place. Near both ends of the bone irregularly shaped cavities may be seen. When the parts were in a fresh condition these cavities were filled with pus, and the lower one opened outwardly through a cloaca. At certain spots the surface of the bone looks as if it were corroded and in a necrotic state.

lungs; inhalation pneumonia of the right lower lobe; passive congestion of the different organs. In view of the fact that the patient had endocarditis of the cardiac valves (aortic and mitral) the diagnosis of em- bolism of the arteria pro fossa Sylvii was made during her lifetime. (No. 45, 1895.) However, as no em- bolic plugging of the larger portions of this vessel and no sclerosis of the cerebral arteries were found at the post-mortem examination, the idea of an embolic plugging of some of the finer ramifications of this artery, or of a hemorrhage due to passive congestion, must, in the present case, be given the preference. Explanation of Plate 34. Porencephalia. On the under surface of the brain, on the left side, may be seen a long groove or pit-like depression, repre- senting a deficiency of brain substance throughout this particular area. It measures 10 cm. in length, and be- tween 3 and 4 cm. in breadth. It begins at the posterior end of the left occipital lobe, extends in a forward direc- tion entirely across it, and then involves the posterior and median portions of the temporal lobe. This pit was filled with serum, and the soft membranes which covered it were somewhat opaque, of a light yellowish-brown color, slightly thickened, and very richly provided with blood-vessels. In this particular case it is not unlikely that the pic- ture presented is that of a secondary porencephalia, one which developed in childhood as a result of a hemor- rhage from some blood-vessel in this region. (It might be termed a case of pseudo-porencephalia.)

SEXUAL APPARATUS. 143 sue which contain in their substance lacteal ducts, the majority of which are dilated. Tuberculosis of the mammary gland, in the form of a tuberculous inflammation, is of very rare occurrence. On the other hand, mammary tuberculosis in dif- ferent forms (miliary eruption, diffuse tuberculous inflammation) is often observed in the cow. (Hence the danger, for man, of an infection of the milk.) New Growths of the Mammary Gland. The connective-tissue tumors of the breast begin their first development in the interacinous, the interlobu- lar, or the periglandular framework of the organ, and they often include in their substance glandular ele- ments and cysts. The lipoma, which originates in the fatty tissue surrounding the gland, is a growth of rare occur- rence; and so too are the myxoma, the myoma, and the chondroma. On the other hand, the fibroma— which is generally seen in the form of a mixed tumor, in combination with an adenoma (fibro-adenoma) — is encountered more frequently. Sarcoma of the mammary gland is a tumor of com- paratively common occurrence. It may present it- self in the form of a circumscribed, nodular tumor, which grows out from a few lobules of the gland, or else it may disseminate itself diffusely throughout the entire organ. The softer varieties of sarcoma are composed of round or spindle cells, while the harder forms are represented by the fibro-sarcoma. The giant-cell sarcoma and the melano-sarcoma occur very rarely. In sections of these sarcomatous growths the cut sur-

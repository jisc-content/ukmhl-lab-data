Explanation of Plate 26. Multiple Fibromata (Neuro-Fibromata) of the Skin. Over the skin of the entire body is scattered a very large number (several thousands) of fibromata, which vary in size from that of a pinâ€™s head to that of an Eng- lish walnut. These tumors are composed of fibrillated connective tissue; they originate in the deeper layers of the cutis (the stratum reticulare) and appear to spring more directly from the connective-tissue sheaths of the nerves which are distributed throughout the cutis. (They are also known as false neuromata or pseudo-neuro- mata.) The nerve fibres pass almost unchanged through the tumors, and no new growth of nerve tissue has ever been demonstrated in these fibromata.

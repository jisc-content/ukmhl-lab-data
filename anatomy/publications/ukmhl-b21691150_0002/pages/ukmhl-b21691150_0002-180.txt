62 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. year (about fifty per cent of all cases), while more rarely the disease is observed between the ages of thirty and forty (from fifteen to twenty per cent of all cases). Aside from individual predisposition, the most effective among the etiological factors are un- doubtedly certain toxic influences, chief among which may be mentioned chronic lead poisoning (house paint- ers, pottery glazers, type setters); excessive use of alcohol, especially when associated with the habitual indulgence in strongly spiced and irritating articles of food which contain a large percentage of albumin (luxurious living); and, finally, a uric-acid diathesis (“gouty contracted kidney”), in which condition the uric acid acts like a poison upon the kidney tissues. In arthritic nephritis—both with and without any in- volvement of the joints—there will often be found in the urinary canaliculi of the medullary substance, which looks as if it had been sprinkled with small white dots, deposits of the urate of sodium in the form of rhombic columns and crystals. The disease is also favored by certain vascular conditions, such as pre- senile arterio-sclerosis, and diffuse hypertrophy of the heart, involving both ventricles and associated with a chronic increase in pressure in the arterial system. As a secondary phenomenon, which occurs with almost perfect regularity, should be mentioned decided hypertrophy and moderate dilatation of the left ventricle; and in many cases this progressive and incurable pathological process is interrupted by some fatal intercurrent disease, like apoplexy, tuberculosis, pleurisy, pneumonia, etc. As concomitant symptoms of this pernicious disease of the kidneys may be men- tioned progressive emaciation, polyuria, moderate al-

ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 194 disease produces a thickening and enlargement of the epiphyses, and the vascular portions of the bone be- come decidedly hyperaemic. The zone in which pro- liferative processes are going on appears to be consid- erably thickened and broadened, whereas the layer in which ossification is going on, and which is broken through at different points so as to resemble a sieve, sends tooth-like outrunners into the hypertrophic zone. The periosteum of bones which are thus affected is always thicker than normal and hyper- aemic. In rachitic children the sutures and fontanelles of the skull remain open longer than they should, and the bone itself—especially in the marginal zones—is more succulent and softer, and bends more easily, than is normal. From the circumstance that the child lies upon its back and so exposes this part of the head to pressure, the posterior portions of the skull cap seem to be abnormally thin, or even worn away to such a degree that holes appear in it. The head as a whole is often abnormally large, with a very promi- nent forehead. A deformed lower jaw and delayed breaking through of the teeth are often observed in this disease. At the points where the bone joins the cartilage the ribs show decided enlargements—the so- called “rickety rosary;” and the sternum is arched in a forward direction (pectus carinatum), like the prow of a boat. The spinal column often presents evidences of scoliosis and kypho-scoliosis. The bony pelvis presents an important deformity which is due to the rachitic process, viz., the approximation of the promonotory to the symphysis—the shortening of the anatomical conjugate (conjugata vera)—while

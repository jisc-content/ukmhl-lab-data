89 SEXUAL APPARATUS. ease being in the prostate gland, the urethra, or the urinary bladder, from which regions the infectious inflammation spreads along the spermatic cord to the epididymis and testicle. It is particularly the gonor- rhoeal infection which spreads in this manner to the testicle, although other suppurative inflammations may also follow the same course. Metastatic infec- tious inflammations in the parenchyma of the testicle are of rare occurrence. They may develop, for ex- ample, in the course of a septico-pysemia or during an attack of small-pox. Some of the milder forms of orchitis and epididymitis occasionally develop in a spontaneous fashion (that is, without any demon- strable cause); or they may be produced by a trau- matism, in which case they usually terminate quickly in a return of the testicle to its normal condition or in more or less atrophy of the organ. As a result of these inflammatory processes the affected parts pre- sent a swollen and reddened aspect, and usually their consistence is increased. The exudation and infiltra- tion of serum and cellular elements wflll be found both within the canaliculi and in the interstices of the tis- sues which lie between them. In the great majority of cases all this exuded material is absorbed and the organ returns to a fairly normal condition. It is a rare occurrence that an abscess forms and breaks first into the sac of the tunica vaginalis and then through the outer skin. Finally, cases are sometimes seen in which the epididymitis and orchitis have become chronic, as evidenced by the proliferation of the con- nective tissue of the epididymis and testicle and by the induration of the affected parts (chronic inter- stitial inflammation). At a more advanced stage of

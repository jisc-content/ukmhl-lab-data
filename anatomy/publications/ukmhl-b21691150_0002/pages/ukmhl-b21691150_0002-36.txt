Explanation of Plate 8. Subacute Parenchymatous and Interstitial Nephri- tis—“Large White Kidney.” The kidney is enlarged to nearly double its normal size (its weight being 255 gm., instead of 140-150 gm.; length, 12.5 cm.; breadth, 7 cm.). The capsule was re- moved with ease, and the underlying surface of the organ was found to be smooth; the stellate arrangement of the veins was plainly recognizable. The consistence of the kidney was markedly diminished; its tissues were of a somewhat washed-out, grayish color (the reddish hue is to be ascribed to the deepening of color which takes place after death). When the kidney was cut open it could be seen that the cortex was broader than normal (1 cm.), and of a grayish color, with some admixture of red. The striations, which should normally be easy to recog- nize, were either effaced altogether or were only indis- tinctly marked in certain spots. A minimal quantity of blood was contained in the organ. A fairly abundant, opaque, and somewhat thickish juice was obtained when the edge of the knife was passed lightly over the surface of the section. The pyramidal substance was of a slightly darker color-—a rather pale red—and the stria- tions were plainly marked. In the patient, who was nineteen years of age, the following pathological changes were found in other organs: Moderate hypertrophy and dilatation of both ventricles of the heart (partly of renal, partly of alco- holic origin); extensive, confluent, catarrhal pneumonia of both sides; sero-fibrinous pleurisy on the right side; moderate general dropsy.

Secon- dary hydrocephalus internus is also a common complication. Tuberculosis of the Spinal Cord and Its Mem- branes. (Plate 29.) This disease is encountered in the form of a me- ningo-myelitis, with an eruption of miliary tubercles. Or, as happens in the brain, although much more rarely, solitary tubercles—either with or without sec- ondary tuberculous meningitis—develop in the spinal cord. (More than one such tubercle is not often seen.) Both clinically and anatomically the results of such long-persisting and slowly growing nodules of conglomerated tubercles are very much the same as those which are observed in cases of tumor of the spinal cord. Spinal pachymeningitis externa tuberculosa (Plate 29) is quite often associated with tuberculous spondy- litis; the tuberculous process, under these circum- stances, extending by direct continuity from the orig- inal seat of the disease to the exterual surface of the dura mater, and there setting up a circumscribed in- flammation accompanied in part by proliferative, in part by necrotic phenomena. In this form of disease the neighboring spinal cord is subjected to changing conditions of pressure, and these give rise to what is known as compression myelitis.

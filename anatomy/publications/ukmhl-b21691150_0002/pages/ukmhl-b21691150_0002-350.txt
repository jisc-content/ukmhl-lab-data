ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 232 ing of cartilage and connective tissue; the production of this covering taking its start from the point where the adhesions form. At some later date the connect- ing peduncle may first stretch and then finally give way altogether; and from this time forward all sorts of trouble may arise from this state of affairs in the joint. It is a curious fact that the cartilaginous por- tion of the piece which has been broken off from the articular surface continues to live, while the bony part dies. Loose bodies of arthritic origin do not show the structure which is characteristic of normal articular cartilage. The so-called rice bodies (corpora oryzoidea) origi- nate from fibrinous material which has been precipi- tated from the synovial fluid. Thus, for example, in joints, sheaths of tendons, and bursae mucosae which are affected with tuberculous disease, all the rice bod- ies are essentially products of the coagulation of fibrin; the tuberculous disease generally playing a very mild part in the process. Some of the rice bodies origi- nate from coagula which have formed in the synovial fluid itself, while others may be traced to products which have been deposited upon the walls of the synovial cavity, and which have, at least in some in- stances, become organized through the instrumen- tality of the cells of the part.

SEXUAL APPARATUS. 133 muscular parts of tlie organ; and papillary cancer (cauliflower tumors), wliicli, in the form of a cauli- flower-like tumor of hemispherical shape, fills the vault of the vagina. These latter growths are gener- ally very easily broken down, owing to their loose consistence. The carcinomata which involve the neck and vagi- nal portion of the uterus begin as mere nodules or knobs, which rapidly break down and form ulcers; and these latter in turn present a finely nodulated surface with elevated margins, and they bleed easily. Another peculiarity of these cancers is shown in the fact that they tend to grow out laterally into the para- metral tissues and also into the upper portions of the vaginal wall. In one-quarter of all cases a carcinoma of the vaginal portion eventually reaches the os inter- num of the uterus. The tendency to break down at an early stage and to form ichorous pus is a char- acteristic which belongs to all the different varieties. Carcinoma of the body of the uterus seems to origi- nate first in the normal uterine glands. It extends its growth as a rule along the surface, and is rarely characterized by the development of nodules. At first the mucous membrane appears to be thickened, the glandular parts showing an atypical proliferation of their epithelial structures; and then these prolif- erating masses of epithelium, after penetrating deep down into the layers of muscular tissue, cause these, through pressure, to melt away and disappear. Quite often papillary forms of cancerous growth are also en- countered. When the irregularly shaped proliferat- ing masses reveal the existence of tubules with a demonstrable lumen, it is customary to apply the

Finally, in some instances, sup- purative inflammation also develops in the connective tissue which surrounds the urethra, thus giving rise to pm- and para-urethral abscesses, the pus in some of these cases collecting in the preformed peri-urethral diverticula which are lined with epithelium. Some of these abscesses and also the secondary purulent in- flammation of the inguinal glands (buboes) owe their origin to a mixed infection. Injuries to the urethra (false passages resulting from the unskilful employment of the catheter) often give rise to an infiltration of pus and urine into the tissues at the root of the penis, or among those of the scrotum and perineum; and out of such infiltra- tion severe forms of suppurative phlegmon, gangrene, and death through septicaemia may develop.

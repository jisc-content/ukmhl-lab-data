175 NERVOUS APPARATUS. oprnent of hydrocephalus, a variety of forms of this condition is produced. Porencephalia sometimes furnishes the anatomical basis of cerebral infantile paralysis. A porencephalia often extends into the ventricles; and when this is brought about by the destruction of the corresponding portions of the cere- bral cortex during intra-uterine life, or in early in- fancy, through some pathological process (such as hemorrhages, inflammations, etc.), it is proper to speak of it as a secondary porencephalia. Apoplectic cysts, such as that shown in Plate 35, may also develop after the period of childhood, through a mechanical injury or an inflammation, or by reason of some disturbance in the circulation (leading to softening). A dropsy of the ventricle favors the establishment of a communication be- tween the defect and the ventricle, and it also exerts a determining influence upon the shape of the defect. Cystic degeneration (intracerebral and subarachnoid cysts) is often observed in the brain of paralytics, and is to be attributed to obstructed circulation of the lymph and to the occurrence of an adhesive arachnitis in the fissures between the convolutions. Such cysts are often arranged like a string of pearls. Tuberculosis of the Brain. (Plate 36.) Tuberculosis of the parenchyma of the brain de- velops almost exclusively in the form of the so-called solitary tubercles or conglomerated tubercles, and much oftener (seven times) in children than in

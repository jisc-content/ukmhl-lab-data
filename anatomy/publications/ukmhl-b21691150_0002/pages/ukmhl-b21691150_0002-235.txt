SEXUAL APPARATUS. 117 Rupture of the Uterus. Rupture of the pregnant uterus is an accident which often happens during labor, in cases in which there are obstacles that tend to prevent the birth of the child. This may happen, for example, when the foe- tus is too large for the channels through which it must pass. In this event the tissues of the cervix get jammed in between the foetus and the wall of the pel- vis, and it is here that the rupture eventually takes place. Almost invariably (ninety per cent of all cases) the rupture results from one of two things— either the bony pelvis is narrowed* and thus presents an obstacle to the birth of the child, or the os uteri is composed of such unyielding tissues or has such a narrow canal that it cannot dilate in a normal manner. The seat of the rupture is generally in the cervix, and often on the left side. The line of the tear usu- ally runs in a longitudinal direction. Shallow tears in the mucous membrane are of com- mon occurrence in childbirth. * A rupture rarely results from the pressure produced by ex- cessive labor pains. Normal contractions occasionally induce an excessive stretching of the cervix and lower segment of the uterus, and they may even produce a rupture when coinciden- tally an induration, stenosis, or atresia of the cervix exists— more rarely, when the vagina is the seat of one of these patho- logical conditions. Then, besides, markedly thinned and very yielding spots in the walls of the uterus—spots indicative of the harmful effects of previous severe labors—are a predisposing factor in the development of a rupture. The same causes may lead to rupture of the vault of the vagina in a case in which the os uteri has been drawn upward and the genital canal has been exposed to excessive stretching in a longitudinal direction.

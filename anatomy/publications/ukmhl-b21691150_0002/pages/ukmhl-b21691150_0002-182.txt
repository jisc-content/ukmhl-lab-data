64 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. parenchyma of the organ evidences of inflammation of the connective-tissue framework will be observed in close proximity to simple atrophy and destruction (through wasting away) of numerous glomeruliâ€” alterations which warrant the belief that arterio- sclerotic changes and a proliferative inflammation which terminates in atrophy often advance hand-in- hand as parallel processes. Tuberculosis of the Kidneys. (Plate 12.) Tuberculosis of the kidneys is very rarely encoun- tered as a primary lesion. It is usually a secondary phenomenon, which owes its origin to the presence of tubercle bacilli in the blood, and which also may be looked upon as one of several evidences of a general- ized miliary tuberculosis. Or else it may be consid- ered in the light of a terminal and accidental mani- festation of this disease in the course of a chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, the tubercles occurring in the kidney in the form of disseminated miliary foci, which occupy every section of the organ, but are especially numerous in the cortex and just beneath the capsule. The tubercles themselves vary greatly in number and in size, some being no larger than a milletseed and presenting a grayish exterior with a whitish or yellowish-white centre, while less frequently they are encountered in the form of subacute granulomata, varying in size from that of a hempseed to that of a pea. The chronic inflammatory form of renal tuberculosis is encountered as one of several manifestations which characterize a tuberculosis of the urinary apparatus

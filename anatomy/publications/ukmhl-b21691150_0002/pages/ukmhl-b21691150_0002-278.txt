160 ATLAS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. In the case of the spinal cord one occasionally ha3 an opportunity of seeing a postsyphilitic chronic lepto- meningitis, with which a secondary involvement of the spinal cord is associated (chronic meningo-mye- litis). In these conditions the vascular apparatus is the part chiefly affected; the blood-vessels—particu- larly the arteries—presenting the appearance (when seen in transverse sections) of thickened and sclerosed rings, with narrowed or even obliterated lumina. Then, in addition, many of the smaller vessels show evidences of having undergone hyaline degeneration. The soft membranes of the brain are opaque, thick- ened, and infiltrated with numerous round cells. In addition to the disease of the blood-vessels, the spinal marrow becomes sclerosed (chronic myelitis), and disintegration of the nerve substance takes place; at the same time, however, the neuroglia remains un- changed. In many cases the disease extends to the dura mater, causing a pachymeningitis spinalis liyper- trophicans. HYDROCEPHALUS. (Plates 26 and 27.) Dropsy of the Ventricles of the Brain. (Hydrocephalus internus.) Dropsy of the Subarachnoid Spaces. (Hydrocephalus externus.) The accumulation of a watery fluid in the cavities of the skull is an event of common occurrence. The majority of cases which belong in this category —cases that have generally developed slowly in adults

356 THE LARYNX.* comes converted into the trachea, and in the mesenchyme surrounding it the incomplete cartilaginous rings develop at about the eighth or ninth week. The cells of the epithelial lining of the trachea and bronchi remain columnar or cubi- cal in form and become ciliated at about the fourthjrtonth, but those of the epithelium of the air-sacs become greatly flattened and constitute an exceedingly thin layer of pave- ment epithelium, The Development of the Larynx.—The opening of the upper end of the pulmonary groove into the pharynx is situated at first just behind the fourth branchial furrow and is surrounded anteriorly and laterally by the fl -shaped rates from the oesophagus, the opening of the trachea into the pharynx is somewhat slit-like and is bounded laterally by the aryepiglottic folds, whose margins present two ele- vations which may be termed the cornicular and cuneiform CO, Cornicular, and cu, cuneiform tubercle; Ep, epiglottis; T, unpaired portion of the tongue.—(Kallius.)

The anterior portion of this ridge, which is apparently derived from the ventral portions of the third bran- chial arch, gradually in- creases in height and forms the epiglottis, while the lateral portions, which pass posteriorly into the mar- gins of the pulmonary groove, form the aryepi- glottic folds. When the pulmonary groove sepa- "I

Exactly how these additional tubules arise is a little uncer- tain, some observers maintaining that they are formed from the substance of the Wolffian ridge in the same manner as the primary tubules with which they later become con- nected (Mihalkovicz), while others hold that they are Fig. 203.â€”Urinogenital Apparatus of a Male Pig Embryo of 6 cm. ao, Aorta; b, bladder; gh, giibernaculum testis; k. kidney; md, Miillerian duct; sr, suprarenal body; t, testis; zu, Wolffian body; wd. Wolffian duct {Mihalkovicz.) formed by the splitting of the primary tubules or as buds from these (Braun, Janhosik). By the formation of these additional tubules and the continued elongation of all, whereby they become thrown into numerous convolutions, the Wolffian ridge becomes a

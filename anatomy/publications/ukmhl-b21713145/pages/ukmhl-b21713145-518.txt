rOST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. This excessive development of the upper portions of the body of the child is largely due to the nature of the blood- supply during fetal life, when, as may be seen by reference to Fig. 157, the blood passing to the head, neck, arms and upper portions of the thorax leaves the aorta before the duc- tus arteriosus opens into it, and is therefore practically un- Ftg. 273.—Child and Man Drawn as of the Same Height.— (Longer, from the " Grozvth of the Brain," Contemporary Science Series, by permission of Charles Scribner's Sons.) mixed with venous blood, while throughout the rest of the body the supply is largely diluted with blood from the right side of the heart. That there is a distinct change in the geometric form of the body during growth is also well shown by the following consideration (Thoma). Taking the average height of a new-born male as 500 mm., and that of a man of thirty years of age as 1686 mm., the height of the body will have

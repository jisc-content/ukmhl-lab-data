DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 234 closing wall, and the cords, increasing in size, unite together to form a network of^^vessels in which float the spherical cells which may now be known as erythrocytes. Viewed from the surface at this stage a portion of the vascular area of the mesoderm would have the appearance shown in Fig. 125, revealing a dense network of canals in which, at inter- vals, are groups of erythrocytes adherent to the walls, con- stituting what have been termed the blood-islands, while in Fig. 124.^—Transverse Section through the Area Vasculosa of Rabbit Embryos showing the Transformation of Mesoderm CELLS into the Vascular Cords. Ec, Ectoderm; En, endoderm; Me, mesoderm.— (van der Stricht.) the meshes of the network unaltered mesoderm cells can be seen, forming the so-called siibstancc-islands. At the J3errpheiy of the vascular area the vessels arrange themselves to form a sinus terminalis enclosingJhe entire area, and the vascularization of the splanchnic mesoderm gradually extends toward the embryo. Reaching it, the vessels penetratelhe embryonic tissues and eventually come into connection with the heart, which has already differen- tiated and has begun to beat before the connection with the vessels is made, so that when it is made the circulation is

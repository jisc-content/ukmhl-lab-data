HISTOGENESIS OF STRIATED MUSCLE TISSUE. 205 one another throughout the length of the fibril and produce the characteristic transverse striation of the tissue. Finally stronger interrupted transverse bands of so-called cement substance appear, dividing the tissue into areas which have usually been regarded as representing the original myo- blasts, but are really devoid of significance as cells, the, tissue^ remaining, strictly speaj<:ing^,.J,_syncytiu^l. The Histogenesis of Striated Muscle Tissue.—The histogenesis of striated or voluntary muscle tissue resembles Fig. 114.—Cross-section of a Muscle from the Thigh of a Pig Embryo 75 mm. Long. A, Central nucleus; B, new peripheral nuc\tus.— (Macallutn.) very closely that which has just been described for the heart muscle. There is a similar formation of a syncytium by the fusion of the cells of the myotomes, an appearance of granules which unite to form fibrils, an increase of the fibrils by longitudinal division and a, primary arrangement of the fibrils around the periphery of areas of sarcoplasm (Fig. 114), each of which represents a muscle fibre. In \ addition there is an active proliferation of the nuclei of the original myoblasts, the new nuclei arranging themselves

DEVELOPMENT OF TIIE DIGESTIVE TRACT. 297 Toward its posterior end the archenteron comes into somewhat simibTTibtb^with the ectoderm, though a marked difference' is noticeable in that the area over which the cloacal endoderm is in contact with the ectoderm to form the cloacal membrane (Fig. 163, cm) lies a little in front of tl^actual eiLdoj-tllie^-cto the jDortionof, the latter which lies posterior to the membrane forming what- has been termed the post-anal ^ut (p.an). This diminishes in size during development and early disappears alto- gether, and the pouch-like fold__seeri_in Fig. 16^ ±>e- tween the intestinal por- tion of the archenteron Fig. 162.—Reconstruction of the Anterior Portion of an Embryo OF 2.15 MM. ab, Aortic bulb; h, heart; o, auditory capsule; op, optic evagination; pm, pharyngeal membrane.— (His.) and the allantoic stalk (a/) deepening until jts^ floor comes into contact with the cloacal mem- brane, the cloaca becomes' divided into a ventral i)' tion, with which the allan- tois and the primitive exj cretory ducts Jw) are connected, and a.dorsal portion which becomes the lower end of the rectum. . This latter abuts upon the dorsal por- tion of the cloacal membrane, and this eventually ruptures, so that the posterior communication of the archenteron with the exterior becomes established. This rupture, however, does not occur until a comparatively late period of develop- ment, until ajter the embryo has reached the fetal stag^ ripr does the position of the inembrane correspond with the adult anus^since later there is a considera1;le development

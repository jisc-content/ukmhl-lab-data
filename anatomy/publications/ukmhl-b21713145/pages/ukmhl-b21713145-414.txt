400 CHAPTER XV. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Histogenesis of the Nervous System.â€”The entire central nervous system is derived from the cells lining the medullary groove, whose formation and conversion into the medullary canal has already been described (p. 98). When the groove is first formed, the cells lining it are some- what more columnar in shape than those on either side of it, though like them they are arranged in a single layer; later they increase by mitotic division and arrange them- selves in several layers, so that the ectoderm of the groove becomes very much thicker than that of the general surface of the body. While its tissue is in this condition the lips of the groove unite, and the subsequent differentiation of the canal so formed differs somewhat in different regions, although a fundamental plan may be recognized. This plan is most readily perceived in the region which becomes the spinal cord, and may be described as seen in that region. Throughout the earlier stages, the cells lining the inner wall of the medullary tube are found in active proliferation, some of the cells so produced arranging themselves with their long axes at right angles to the central canal and extending throughout the entire thickness of the wall to form a supportive framework (Fig. 220), while others, whose destiny is for the most part not yet determinable, and which therefore may be termed indiiferent cells, occur in the meshes of this framework. At this stage a trans- verse section of the medullary tube shows it to be composed

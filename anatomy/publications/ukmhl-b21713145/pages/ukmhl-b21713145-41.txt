27 THE MATURATION OF THE OVUM. and theca cells are derivatives of the embryonic ovarial epithelium the essential differences between the two origins that have been ascribed to the liiteiim cells may not be so great as has been supposed. The prevalent tendency toward attributing internal secre- tions to obscure organs has not allowed the corpus luteum to escape, and it has been suggested (Marshall and Jolly) that it provides a secretion which is essential for the changes taking place during the fixation of the embr)^o and for its develop- ment during the early stages. In support of this view it has been found that if the ovaries were removed from rats and bitches at various stages after impregnation, pregnancy did not continue if the operation were performed during its earlier stages. The Maturation of the Ovum.â€”Returning now to the ovum, it has been shown that at the time of its extrusion from the Graafian follicle it is not equivalent to a sperma- tozoon but to a primary spermatocyte, and it may be remem- bered that such a spermatocyte becomes converted into a spermatozoon only after it has undergone two divisions, during which there is a reduction of the number of the chromosomes to one half the number characteristic for the species. Similar divisions and a similar reduction of the chromo- somes occur in the case of the ovum, constituting what is termed its maturation. The phenomena have not as yet been observed in human ova, and, indeed, among mammals only with any approach to completeness in the mouse (Sobotta), and guinea-pig (Rubaschkin) ; but they have been observed in so many other forms, both vertebrate and invertebrate, and present in all cases so much uniformity in their general features, that there can be little question as to their occurrence in the human ovum. In typical cases the ovum (the primary oocyte) under- goes a division in the prophases of which the chromatin aggregates to form half as many tetrads as there are chro-

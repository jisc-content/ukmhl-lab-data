46o THE ORGANS OF TASTE. The Organs of Touch and Taste.—Nothing is yet known concerning the development of the various forms of tactile organs, which belong to the second class of sensory organs described above. The Organs of Taste.—The remaining organs of special sense belong to the third class, and of these the organs of taste present in many respects the simplest condition. They are developed principally in connection with the vallate and foliate papillae of the tongue, and of the former one of the earliest observed stages has been found in embryos of 9 cm. in the form of two ridges of epidermis, lying toward Fig. 246.—Diagrams Representing the Development of a Vallate Papilla. a. Valley surrounding the papilla; b, von Ebner's gland.— (Graberg.) the back part of the tongue and inclined to one another in such a manner as to form a V with the apex directed back- ward. From these ridges solid downgrowths of epidermis into the subjacent tissue occur, each downgrowth having the form of a hollow truncated cone with its basal edge con- tinuous with the superficial epidermis (Fig. 246, A). In later stages lateral outgrowths develop from the deeper edges of the cone, and about the same time clefts appear in the substance of the original downgrowths (Fig. 246, B) and, uniting together, finally open to the surface, forming a trench surrounding a papilla (Fig. 246, C). The lateral outgrowths, which are at first solid, also undergo an axial degeneration and become converted into the glands of Ebncr (b), which open into the trench near its floor. The various

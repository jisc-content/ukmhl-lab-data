These fibers constitute the fornix, whose peculiar course in the adult brain may be under- stood by a consideration of the rotation of the hemispheres during growth which results in the formation of the temporal lobe (see p. 427). The portion of the triangle included be- tween the callosum and the fornix remains thin and forms the septum pellucidum, and a split Fig. 237.—Median Longitudinal Sec- tion OF THE Brain of an Embryo of Four Months. c, Calcarine fissure; ca, anterior commis- sure; cc, corpus callosum; cf, chori- oidal fissure; dg, dentate gyrus; fm, interventricular foramen; h, hippo- campal fissure; po, parieto-occipital fissure.— {Mihalkovicz.) occurring in the center of this gives rise to the so-called fifth ventricle, which, from its mode of formation, is a com- pletely closed cavity and is not lined with ependymal tissue of the same nature as that found in the other ven- tricles. Owing to the very considerable size reached by the area of concrescence of the hemispheres, whose history has just been described, important changes are wrought in the ad- joining portions of the mesial surface of the hemispheres. Before the development of the area the gyrus dentatus and

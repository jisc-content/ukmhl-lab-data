POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. 1686 increased from birth to adolescence = 3.37 tnnes. The child will weigh 3.1 kilos and the man 66.1 kilos, and if the specific gravity of the body with the included gases be taken in the one case as 0.90 and in the other as 0.93, then the volume of the child's body will be 3.44 liters and that of the man's 71.08 liters, and the increase in volume will be^^-â€”= 20.66. If the increase in volume had taken 3-34 place without any alteration in the geometric form of the body, it should be equal to the cube of the increase in height; this, however, is 3.37^ = 38.27, a number well-nigh twice as large as the actual increase. But in addition to these changes, which are largely de- pendent upon differences in the supply of nutrition, there are others associated with alterations in the general metab- olism of the body. Up to adult life the constructive metab- olism or anabolism is in excess of the destructive metabolism or katabolism, but the amount of the excess is much greater during the earlier periods of development and gradually diminishes as the adult condition is approached. That this is true during intrauterine life is shown by the following figures, compiled by Donaldson: Age in Weeks. Weight in (jrams. Age in Weeks. Weight in Grams. 0 (ovum) 0.0006 24 635 4 28 1220 8 4 32 1700 12 20 36 2240 16 120 40 (birth) 3250 20 From this table it may be seen that the embryo of eight weeks is six thousand six hundred and sixty-seven times as heavy as the ovum from which it started, and if the in- crease of growth for each of the succeeding periods of four weeks be represented as percentages, it will be seen that the 44

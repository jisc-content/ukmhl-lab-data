DEVELOPMENT OF TtlE VENOUS SYSTEM. 2/3 and_C_iivierian duct is dissolyed, the blood from the left side of the head and neck and from the left subclavian vein pass- ing over to empty into the right jugular, whose lower end, together with the right Cuvierian duct, thus becomes the superior vena cava. The left Cuvierian duct persists, form- ing with the left horn of the sinus venosus the coronary sinus. Fig. 152.â€”Diagrams showing the Development of the Superior Vena Cava. o, Azygos vein; cs, coronary sinus; ej, external jugular; h, hepatic vein; ij, internal jugular; inr and inl, right and left innominate veins; s, subclavian; vci and vcs, inferior and superior venae cavse. The external jugular vein develops somewhat later than the internal. The facial vein, whjch primarily forms the principal affluent of this stem, passes at first into the skull along with the fifth nerve and communicates with the in- ternal jugular system, but later this original communica- tion is broken and the facial vein, uniting with other super- ficial veins, passes over the jaw and extends down the neck as the external jugular. Later still the facial anastomoses with the ophthalmic at the inner angle of the eye and also makes connections with the internal jugular just after it has_crpsse_d thejawj and so_the^ adult condition is acquired.

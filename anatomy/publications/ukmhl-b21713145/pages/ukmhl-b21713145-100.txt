DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRANCHIAL ARCHES. 86 two, arches, the firsMvith a well-developed maxillary proc- _ess^ jind the cleft separating them can l)e distinguished. Tliis is due to a sinking" inward of the region occupied by the three posterior arches so that a triangular depression, the siniis_j^'^cejTi>iQalis., is formed on each side of what will later become the anterior i^art ot the neck region. This is well shown in an embryo (Brg) descril)C(l by His which measured 6.9 mm. in length and of which the anterior por- tion is shown in Fig. 51. The anterior boundary of the PiG_ 51.—Head of Embryo of 6.9 mm. na, Nasal pit; ps, precervical sinus.—(Hw.) sinus {ps) is formed by the posterior edge of the second arch and its postei'ior boundary by the thoracic wall, and m later stages \hese~two boundaries gradually approach one another so as f^rst of all to diminish the opening into the sinus and later to completely obhterate it by fusing together, the sinus thus becoming converted into_a completely closed cavity whose'floor is formed by the ectoderm covering the

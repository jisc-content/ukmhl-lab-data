THE MESODERMIC SOMITES. I08 passes through the hmb buds and it grows out into these buds to form an axial core for them (Fig. 6i, Lr), in which later the skeleton of the limb forms. The remainder of the mesoderm lining- the sides and ventral portions of the body- wall is at first formed from the membrana reuniens, but as development proceeds the somatic layer gradually extends more ventrally and displaces, or, more properly speaking, assimilates into itself, the membrana reuniens until finally the latter has completely disappeared. It is to be noted that no part of the voluntary muscula- ture of the lateral and ventral walls of the neck and trunk is derived from the somatic layer; it is formed entirely from the myotomes which gradually extend ventrally and finally come into contact with their fellows of the opposite side in the mid-ventral line. Whether the voluntary mus- culature of the limbs is also derived from the myotomes is at present doubtful. It has been very generally believed that the myotomes in their growth ventrally sent prolonga- tions into the limb buds which invested the axial core of mesenchyme and eventually gave rise to the voluntary mus- cles, and such may really be the case, the relations of the various parts developed from the gastral mesoderm being as represented in the diagrams composing Fig. 6i. The act,ual existence of the prolongations of the myotomes and their conversion into the limb musculature has, however, not yet been observed and it is quite possible that the limb muscu- lature may be derived from the axial core of somatic meso- derm from which the limb skeleton develops. The appearance of the mesodermic somites is an impor- tant phenomenon in the development of the embryo, since it influences fundamentally the future structure of the or- ganism. If each pair of mesodermic somites be regarded as an element and termed a metamere or_segment, then__it iTiav be said that the body is composed of a series of_meta-

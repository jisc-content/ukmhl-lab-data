FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 58 that portion of the middle layer which forms the roof of the amniotic cavity disappears, only the trophoderm per- sisting in this region, but in another form this is not the case, the roof of the cavity being composed of both the trophoderm and the middle layer. A rabbit's ovum in which there is yet no amniotic cavity and no splitting of the enveloping layer shows, when viewed from above, a relatively small dark area on the surface.

But if it be looked at from the side (Fig. 29, A), it will be seen that the upper half of the ovum, that half in which the embryonic disk occurs, is somewhat darker than the lower half, the line of sepa- ration of the two shades corresponding with the edge of the primary endoderm which has extended so far in its growth

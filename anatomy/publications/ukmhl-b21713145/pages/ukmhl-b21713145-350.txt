33^ THE PERICARDIUM AND PLEURO-PERITONEUM. become continnous behind tlic liearl, 1)nt not anteriorly, since the ventral \\all qfjhe bud)^ is formed in the heartl-egioTT i before the union can take place. It is possible, therefore, to recognize J:wo portions in the embryonic coelom. an anterior one, the J)arietal cavity (His), which is never connected later- ally with the extra-embryonic oavity, and a posterior one, the tnmk cavity, which is so con- nected. The heart is situated in the parietal cavity._a consider- able portion of_wJi]ch is destined to. become thepericardial_cavity. Since the parietal^ cavity lies hnmediatelx anterior to the still wide yolk-stalk, as may be seen from the position of the heart in the embryo shown in Fig. 42, it is bounded posteriorly by the yolk-stalk. This boundary is complete, however, only in the median line, the cavity be- ing continuous on either side of the yolk-stalk with the trunk- cavity by passages which have been termed the recessus parie- tales_XF\g. 186, Bp and Rca). Passing forward toward tlie heart in the_ splanchnic meso- derm which surrounds the yolk- stalk are the large omphalo-mesenterLc. veijis, one on either side^ and these ^hqrtly become so large_^_Jo_j3ring the splanchnic mesoderm in which they lie in contact with the Out Rca.

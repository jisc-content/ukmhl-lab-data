THE CORNEA. 49-7 cated. After the lens has separated from the surface ecto- derm a thin layer of mesoderm grows in between the two structures and later gives place to a layer of homogeneous substance in which a few cells, more numerous laterally than at the center, are embedded. Still later cells from the adja- cent mesenchyme grow into the layer, which increases con- siderably in thickness, and blood-vessels also grow into that portion of it which is in contact with the outer surface of the ac Fig. 27T.—Transverse Section through the Ciliary Region of a Pig Embryo of 23 mm. ac, Anterior chamber of the eye; co, cornea; ec, ectoderm; lens; mc, ciHary muscle; p, pigment layer of the optic cup; r, retinal layer; tv, tunica vasculosa lentis.— (Angelucci.) lens. At this stage the interval between the surface ecto- derm and the lens is occupied by a solid mass of mesodermal tissue (Fig. 271, co and tv), but as development proceeds, small spaces filled with fluid'begin to appear toward the inner portion of the mass (ac), and these, increasing in number and size, eventually fuse together to form a single 43

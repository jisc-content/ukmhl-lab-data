326 THE LIVER. The further development of the hver, so far as its exter- nal form is concerned, consists in the mpid enlargement of the hepatic portion until it occupies_ihe^grgaler_^ upper half of the abdominal cavity, its ventral edge extend- ing as far down as the umbilicus. In the rabbit its Tub- stance becomes divided into four lobes corresponding to the four veins, umbilical and omphalo-mesenteric, which trav- erse it, and the same condition occurs in the human embryo, although the lobes are not so clearly indicated upon the Fig. i8i.—Reconstructions of the Liver Outgrowths of Rabbit Embryos of (A) 5 ^mm. and (B) of 8 mm. B, Gall-bladder; d, duodenum; DV, ductus venosus; L, liver; p, dorsal pancreas; pm, ventral pancreas; rL, right lobe of the liver; S, stomach.—(Hammar.) surface_s-s in the rabbit. The two omphalo-mesenteric lobes are in close_apposition and may almost be regarded as one, a median ventral lobe which embraces the ductus venosus (Fig. 181, B, DV), while the umbilical lobes are more lat- eral and dorsal and re_present the right^(rL) and left lobes of _tjie adult liver. The remaining definite lobes, the cau- date__(Spigelian) and quadrate, are of later_jormation,

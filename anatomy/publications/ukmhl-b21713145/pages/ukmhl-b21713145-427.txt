THE MYELENCEPHALON. withjt._ Finally, a third flexure occurs in the region of the "^n^encephalqn and is entirely peculiar to the nervous sys- tern; it consists of^a bending ventrally of the floor of the hind-brain, the_.rooLgfJhis portion of, the brain not being affected by it, and it may consequently be known as the pons flexure. In the later, development the pons flexure practically dis- ajDp^rs, owing to the development in this region of the transverse fibers and nyclei of the pons, but the mid-brain and neck flexures persist^ though greatly reduced in acute- ness. the axis of the anterior portion of the adult brain l^eing inclined to that of the medulla at an angle of about 134 degrees. The Development of the Myelencephalon.—In its poste- rior portion the myelencephalon closely resembles the spinal cord and has a very similar development. More anteriorly, however, the roof-plate (Fig. 227, rp) widens to form an. exceedingly thin membrane, the posterior velum; with the broadening of the roof-plate there is associated a broaden- ing of the dorsal portion of the brain_cayity, the dorsal and ventral zones bending outward, until, in the anterior por- tion of the after-brajn, the margins of the dorsal zone have a lateral position, and are, indeed, bent ventrally to form a reflected Jip^ (Fig. 227). The portion of the Jourth ventricle contained in this division of the brain becomes thus converted into a broad shallow cavity, whose floor is formed by the ventral zones separated in the median line by a deep groove, the floor of which is the somewhat thick- ened floor-plate. About ^he fourth month there appears in thej;oo£-jgilate_a transverse groove into which the surround- ing mesenchyme dips, and, as the groove deepens in later stages, the mesenchyme contained within it becomes con- verted into blood-vessels, forming the chorioid plexus oi the fourth ventricle, a structure which, as may be seen from its

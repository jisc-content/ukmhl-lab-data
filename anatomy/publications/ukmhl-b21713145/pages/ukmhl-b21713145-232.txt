THE CRANIAL MUSCULATURE. 2l8 from its branchiomere, the stylopharyngeus arising from the base of the styloid process. The innervation of this muscle by the ninth nerve indicates, however, its true sig- nificance, and since fibers of this nerve of the third arch also pass to the constrictor muscles of the pharynx, a portion of these must also be regarded as having arisen from the third branchiomere. The cartilages of the fourth and fifth arches enter into the formation of the larynx and the muscles of the corre- sponding branchiomeres constitute the muscles of the larynx, together with the remaining portions of the constrictors of the pharynx and the muscles of the soft palate, with the exception of the tensor. Both these arches have branches of the tenth nerve associated with them and hence this nerve supplies the muscles named. In addition, two of the ex- trinsic muscles of the tongue, the glosso-palatinus and chon- droglossus, belong to the fourth or fifth branchiomere, although the remaining muscles of this physiological set are myotomic in origin. Finally, portions of two other muscles should probably be included in the list of branchiomeric muscles, these mus- cles being the trapezius and sternomastoid. It has already been seen that they are partly derived from the cervical myotomes, but they also appear to be innervated in part by the spinal accessoi"y, and since the motor fibers of this nerve are serially homologous with those of the vagus it would seem that the muscles which they supply are probably branchiomeric in origin. Observations on the development of these muscles, determining their relations to the branch- iomeres, are necessary, however, before their morphological significance can be regarded as definitely settled. The table on page 219 shows the relations of the various cranial muscles to the myotomes and branchiomeres, as well as to the motor cranial nerves.

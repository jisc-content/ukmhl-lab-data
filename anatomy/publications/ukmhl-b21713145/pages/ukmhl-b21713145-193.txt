179 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL. nial masses in their gen- eral characters and rela- tions resemble vertebral bodies, and there are good reasons for believing that they represent four verte- brae which, in later stages, are taken up into the skull region and fuse with the primitive chondrocranium. In the human embryo they are less distinct than in lower mammals, but since a three-rooted liypogjossal and a suboccipital nerve also occur in man^^^js probable^jtliat the corr-e- sponding vertebrae are also represented. Indeed, con- firmation of their existence may be found in the fact that during the cartilagi- nous stage of the skull the hypoglossal foramina are divided into three portions by two cartilaginous parti- tions which separate the three roots of the hypo- glossal nerve. It seems certain from the evidence derived from embryology and comparative anatomy that the hunian skull js composed__oL_a_ .primitive / Fig. ioi.—Frontal Section through THE Occipital and Upper Cervi- cal Regions of a Calf Embryo of 8.7 MM. ai and ai^, Intervertebral arteries ; bc^, first cervical intervertebral plate; bo, suboccipital intervertebral plate ; c^"^ cervical nerves ; ch, notochord ; K, vertebral centrum; w^~', occipi- tal myotomes; w^"", cervical myo- tomes; o'"^ roots of hypoglossal nerve; vj, jugular vein; x and xi, vagus and spinal accessory nerves. — {Froriep.)

500 THE LACHRYMAL GLAND. dermic tissue, solid rods of ectoderm, certain of which early give off numerous short lateral processes and become recog- nizable as the tarsal (Meibomian) glands (m), while others retain the simple cylindrical form and represent the glands of Moll. When the eyelids separate, these solid ingrowths become hollow by -a breaking down of their central cells, just as in the sebaceous and sudoriparous glands of the skin, the tarsal glands being really modifications of the former glands, while the glands of Moll are probably to be regarded as specialized sudoriparous glands. A third fold of skin, in addition to the two which pro- duce the eyelids, is also developed in connection with the eye, forming the pUca semihmaris. This is a rudimentary third eyelid, representing the nictitating membrane which is fairly well developed in many of the lower mammals and especially well in birds. The lachrymal gland is developed at about the third month as a number of 1)ranching outgrowtlis of the_ecto- derm into the adjacent mesoderm along the outer part of the line where the epithelium of the conjunctiva becomes continuous with that covering the injiex.surface. of the upper eyelid. As in the other epidermal glands, the outgrowths and their branches are at first solid, later becoming hollow * by; the degeneration of their axial cells. The naso-lacliryiiutl duct is developed in connection with the groove which, at an early stage in the development (Fig. 52), extends from the inner corner of the eye to the olfactory pit and is bounded posteriorly by the maxillary process of the first visceral arch. The epithelium lying in the floor of this groove thickens toward the beginning of the sixth week to form a solid cord, which sinks into the subjacent mesoderm, though retaining connection with the ectoderm of the olfactory pit at its lower end. From its upper end two outgrowths arise which become connected

361 THE PRONEPHROS. The development of the excretory organs is remarkable in that three sets of organs appear in succession. The first of these, the pronephros, exists in a very rudimentary condition in the human embryo, although its duct, the pronephric or WoMan duct, undergoes complete develop- ment and plays an important part in the development of the succeeding organs of excretion and also in that of the reproductive organs. The second set, the mesonephros or Wolffian body, reaches a considerable development during embryonic life, but later, on the development of the final set, the definite kidney or metanephros, undergoes degen- eration, portions only persisting as rudimentary structures associated for the most part w^ith the reproductive organs. The Development of the Pronephros and the Pro- nephric Duct.â€”The first portions of the excretory system to make their appearance are the pronephric or Wolffian ducts, and these develop as thickenings of the lateral parts of the intermediate cell-masses. At first the thickenings form solid cords of cells (Fig. 201, zvd), but later a lumen appears in the center of each cord, which thus becomes converted into a canal. In early stages the cords, toward their posterior ends, may undergo a secondary fusion with the immediately overlying ectoderm (Martin) and may thereby present the appearance of having arisen from that layer, but when fully developed the ducts lie in the sub- stance of the Wolffian ridges (Fig. 200, zc/c/), their anterior ends being situated well forward in the region occupied by the heart, whence they extend backward to open on the ventral part of the lateral walls of the cloaca (Fig. 163). The pronephros has been observed in embryos of about 3 mm. as two tubular invaginations of the coelomic epi- thelium into the substance of each Wolffian ridge, in the region in which the anterior end of the Wolffian duct is found (Janhosik). The tubules do not proceed to com- 32

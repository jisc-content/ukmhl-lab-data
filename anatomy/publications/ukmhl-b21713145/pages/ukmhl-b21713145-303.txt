DEVELOPMENT OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 289 crepancies in these different views and to determine th^ essential point whetherjhe lymphatic vessels arise as out- growths from the velnS-.orby the fusion ofjTiesench3aiiatQiis spaces. Lymph nodes have not been observed in human embryos until toward the end of the third month of development, but they appear in pig embryos of 3 cm. Their unit of struc- ture is a blood-vessel,_breakingLlip at its termination into a leash of capillaries, around which a con- densation of lymphocytes_^ccurs in~the mesenchyme. A structure oFthis kind forms what is termed a lymphoid follicle and may exist, even in this simple condition, in the adult. More frequently, however, there are associated with the follicle lymphatic vessels, or rather the follicle develops in a network of lymphatic vessels, which become an investment of the follicle and form with it a simple lymph node. This condition is, however, in many cases but transitory, the artery branching and collections of ly^hoid tissue forming around each of the branches, so that a series of follicles are formed, which, together with the surrounding lymphatic vessels, be- come enclosed by a connective-tissue capsule to form a com- pound lymph node. Later trabeculse of connective tissue extend from the capsule toward the center of the node, between the follicles, the lymphatic network gives rise to peripheral and central lymph sinuses, and the follicles, each with its arterial branch, constitute the peripheral nodules 26 Fig. 159.—Diagram of a Primary Lymph Node of AN Embryo Pig of 8 cm. a, artery; aid, afferent lymph duct; eld, efferent lymph duct; ^ follicle.— (Sabin.)

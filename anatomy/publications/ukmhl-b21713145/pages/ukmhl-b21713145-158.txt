144 SEPARATION OF THE DECIDU^. the maternal side either by endotheHum which has extended out over the maternal tissues from the vessels which commu- nicate with the space or partly thus and partly by the spread- ing out of the syncytium of the fixation villi over the maternal surface (Rossi Doria). The erosion of the maternal tissues by the chorionic syncy- tium, both during the implantation of the ovum and the forma- tion of the placenta, is a most striking phenomenon and can hardly fail to suggest a comparison of the ovum to a parasite sending its destructive rootlets or haustoria down into the tis- sues of its host, thereby securing for itself additional possi- bilities for nutrition. Indeed, this idea has led to a suggestion by Rossi Doria that the formation of the placenta is a struggle between the parasite and the maternal tissues, the decidual cells of the latter, massing beneath the intervillous space to form what has been termed the basal plate, constituting a line of resistance to the continued encroachments of the syncytium. The Separation of the Deciduae at Birth.â€”At parturi- tion, after the rupture of the amnion and the expulsion of the fetus, there still remains in the uterine cavity the decidu?e and the amnion, which is in contact but not fused with the decidujE. A continuance of the uterine contractions, pro- ducing what are termed the " after-pains," results in the separation of the placenta from the uterine walls, the separa- tion taking place in the deep layers of the spongiosum, so that the portion of the mucosum which contains the unde- generated glands remains behind. As soon as the placenta has separated, the separation of the decidua vera takes place gradually though rapidly, the line of separation again being in the deeper layers of the stratum spongiosum, and the whole of the deciduae, together with the amnion, is expelled from the uterus, forming what is known as the " after- birth." Hemorrhage from the uterine vessels during and after the separation of the deciduee is prevented by the contrac- tions of the uterine walls, assisted, according to some au- thors, by a preliminary blocking of the mouths of the uter- ine vessels by certain large polynuclear decidual cells found during the later months of pregnancy in the outer layers

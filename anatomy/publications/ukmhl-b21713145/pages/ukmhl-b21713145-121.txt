THE MESODERMIC SOMITES. into segments in connection with the development of the hranchial arches and clefts. A consideration of these seg- ments, which are known as the hranchiomcres, may conve- niently be postponed until the chapters dealing with the development of the cranial muscles and nerves, and in what follows here attention will be confined to what occurs in the ventral mesoderm of the neck and trunk. Its splanchnic layer applies itself clo.s£ly_J:Q-J±ie^endQ- dermal digestive tract (Fig. 6i, Sp), wliich is constricted off from the dorsal portion of the yolk-sac, and becomes converted into mesenchyme out of which the muscular coats of the digestive tract develop. The cells which line the pleuroperitoneal cavity, however, retain their arrangement in a layer and form^pait^fjyie_s^^ toneal and_othei^serous cavities, the remainder of the lining being formed by the corresponding cells of the somatic layer; and in the abdominal region the superficial cells, sit- uatedjiear the line_where the splanchnic layer passes into the somatic, aiid in close proximity to the nephrotome of tlie interhiedfate cell-mass, become columnar in shape and are converted into reproductive cells. The somatic layer, if traced peripherally, becomes con- tinuous at the sides with the layer of mesoderm which lines the outer surface of the amnion (Fig. 60) and posteriqrly with the mesoderm of the belly-stalk. That portion of it which lies within the body of the embryo, in addition to giving rise to the serous lining of the parietal layer of the pleuroperitoneum, becomes converted into mesenchyme, which for a considerable length of time is clearly differen- tiated into two zones, a more compact dorsal one which may be termed the somatic layer proper, and a thinner, more ventral vascular zone which is termed the rnembrana reuniens (Fig. 61). In the earlier stages the somatic layer proper does not extend ventrally beyond the line which

438 THE CRANIAL NERVES. These three sets of roots are readily recognizable both in the embryonic and in the adult brain, especially if atten- tion be directed to the cell groups or nuclei with which they are associated (Fig. 239). Thus there can be recognized: (I) a series of nuclei from which nerve-fibers arise, situ- ated in the floor of the fourth ventricle and iter close to the median line and termed the ventral motor nuclei; (2) a second series of nuclei of origin, situated more laterally and YiG 239—Transverse Section through the Medulla Oblongata OF an Embryo of 10 mm., showing the Nuclei of Origin of the Vagus (X) and Hypoglossal (X//) Nerves.—(Hu.) in the substance of the formatio reticularis, and known as the lateral motor nuclei; and (3) a series of nuclei in which afferent nerve-fibers terminate, situated still more laterally in the floor of the ventricle and forming the dorsal or sen- sory nuclei. None of the twelve cranial nerves usually recognized in the text-books contains fibers associated with all three of these nuclei; the fibers from the lateral motor

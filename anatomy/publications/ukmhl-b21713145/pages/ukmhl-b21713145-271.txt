One other change is still necessary before the vessels acquire the arrangement which they possess during fetal life, and this consists in the disappearance of the lower por- tion of the right aortic arch (Fig. 143), sq^ that the left arch alone forms the connection between the heart and the dorsal jiorta. The upper part of the right'aortic arch pei^^ sists to form the proximal part of the right subclavian artery, the portion of the ventral trunk which unites the arch with the aortic bulb becoming the innominate artery. 23.

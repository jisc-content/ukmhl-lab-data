THE FORMATION OF THE BLOOD. as the spleen, assisting;^Jn_tlie formation of the latter elements. Until about the second month of development the erythro- cytes and leukocytes are the only elements found in the blood, and in the haematopoietic organs they may be observed in active mitosis. In addition other cells, having the^ame general^appearanee as the erythrocytes but lacking haemo- globin, also occur, and tliese, which may be termed eryihrb- hlastSj^ produce by division erythrocytes in which haemo- globin gradually appears. After the second month, how- ever, a third form of blood-elements appears in the form of non-nucleated discs containing haemoglobin, and these may be termed erytkroplastids. They are derived from the ery- throcytes, whose nuclei, origi- nally reticular in structure, (^\ (^\ /-^^^ gradually condense to become ^-"'^ ^-j^ \Jy \_j spherical, deeply staining „ _ „ ^ ^ * Fig. 128.—Stages in the Trans- masses, and are finally com- formation of an Erythrocyte pletely extrud^from tli^ '/.r//r/c?0™'°''^'"°'~ cytoplasm (Fig. 128). The cast-off nuclei undergo degeneration and phagocytic ab- sorption by the leukocytes, and the masses of cytoplasm pass into the circulation, becoming more and more numerous as development proceeds, until finally they are the only ■haemoglobin-containing elements in the blood and form '^^ll^L^I^ properly termed the red blood-corpuscles. In the later Jetal and the post-natal stages erythrocytes are to be found only in the red bone-marrow. ^^J^^.l^r^^^^tj^P new leukocytes there is a tendency for the dividing cells to collect in more or less definite groups which have been termed germ-centers (Flemming). The new cells when they first pass into the circulation have a rela-' tively large_niicleus surrounded by a small amount of cyto- plasm, and, since they resemble the cells found in the lym- phatic vessels, are termed kmMiocvtes.

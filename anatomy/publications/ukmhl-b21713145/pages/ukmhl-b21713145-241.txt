227 THE LIMB MUSCLES. become attached to the femur and has associated itself with a prceaxial muscle to form a compound structure. An appearance of migration may also be produced by a muscle making- a secondary attachment below its orig-inal origin or above the insertion and the upper or lower part, as the case may be, then degenerating into connective tissue. This has been the case with the peroneus longus, which, in the lower mammals, has a femoral origin, but has in man a new origin from the fibula, its upper portion being repre- sented by the fibular lateral ligament of the knee-joint. So too the pectoralis minor primarily inserted into the humerus, but it has made a secondary attachment to the coracoid process, its distal portion forming a coraco-humeral ligament. The comparative study of the flexor muscles of the anti- brachial and crural regions has yielded abundant evidence of extensive modifications in the differentiation of the limb muscles. In the tailed amphibia these muscles are represented by a series of superposed layers, the most superficial of which arises from the humerus or femur, while the remaining ones take their origin from the ulna or fibula and are directed distally and laterally to be in- serted either into the palmar or plantar aponeurosis, or, in the case of the deeper layers, into the radius (tibia) or carpus (tarsus). In the arm of the lower mammalia the deepest layer becomes the pronator quadratus, the lateral portions of the superficial layer are the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor carpi radialis, while the intervening layers, together with the median portion of the superficial one, assuming a more directly longitudinal direction, fuse to form a common flexor mass which acts on the digits through the palmar aponeurosis. From this latter structure and from the carpal and metacarpal bones five layers of palmar muscles take origin. The radial and ulnar portions of the

THE PLACENTA. of the degeneration noticeable in the other deciduae, but persists until birth, forming a part of the structure termed the placenta. The Placenta.â€”This organ, which forms the connection between the embryo and the maternal tissues, is composed of two parts, separated by the intervillous space. One of these parts is of embryonic origin, being the chorion fron- fesuni, while the other belongs to the maternal tissues and is the idecidua basalis. Hence the terms placenta fetalis and placenta uterina frequently applied to the two parts. The fully formed placenta is a more or less discoidal struc- ture, convex on the surface next the uterine muscularis and concave on that turned toward the embryo, the umbilical cord being continuous with it near the center of. the latter surface. It averages about 3.5 cm. in thickness, thinning out somewhat toward the edges, and has a diameter of 15 to 20 cm., and a weight varying between 500 and 1250 grams. It is situated on one of the surfaces of the uterus, the posterior more frequently than the anterior, and usually much nearer the fundus than the internal orifice. It devel- ops, in fact, wherever the ovum happens to become attached to the uterine walls, and occasionally this attachment is not accomplished until the ovum has descended nearly to the internal orifice, in which case the placenta may completely close this opening and form what is termed a placenta prcevia. If a section of a placenta in a somewhat advanced stage of development be made, the following structures may be distinguished : On the inner surface there will be a delicate layer representing the amnion (Fig. 76, Am), and next to this a somewhat thicker one which is tlie chorion (C/tQ^. in which the degenerative changes already mentioned may be observed. Succeeding this comes a much broader area composed of the large intervillous blood space in which lie

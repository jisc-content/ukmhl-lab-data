DEVELOrMKNT OF APPENDICULAR SKELETON. 198 of the quadriceps extensor cruris. Its cartilage does not appear until the fourth month of intrauterine life, when most of the primary centers for other bones have already appeared, and its ossification does not begin until the third year after birth. The tarsus, like the carpus, consists of a proximal row of three cartilages, termed the tihialc, the intermedium, and the Hhulare, and of a distal row of four tarsalia. Between these two rows a single cartilage, the centrale, is interposed. Each of these cartilages ossifies from a single center, that of the intermedium early fusing with the tibiale, though it occasionally remains distinct as the os trigonum, and from a comparison with lower forms it seems probable that the fibular cartilage of the distal row really represents two separate elements, there being, properly speaking, five tar- salia instead of four. The fibulare, in addition to its pri- mary center, possesses also an epiphysial center, which develops at the point of insertion of the tendo Achillis. A comparison of the carpal and tarsal cartilages and their relations to the adult bones may be seen from the fol- lowing table: Carpus. Tarsus. Cartilages. Bones Bones Cartilages.

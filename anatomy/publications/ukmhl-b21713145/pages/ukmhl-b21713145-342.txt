This condition of affairs persists until birth, but later the cylinders undergo an elongation, the cells of which they are composed slipping over one an- other apparently, so that the cylinders become thinner as well as longer and show for the most part only two cells in a transverse section (Fig. 183, B) ; and in still later periods the two cells, instead of lying opposite one another, may alternate, so that the cylinders become even more slender.

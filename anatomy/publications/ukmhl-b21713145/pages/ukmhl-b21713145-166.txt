DEVELOPMENT OF THE NAILS. 152 sp- sc ep together forming what has been termed the eponychiiim (Fig. 82, cp). The epitrichinm soon disappears, however, leaving only the outer layers of the stratum corneum as a covering, and this also later disappears with the exception of a narrow band sur- rounding the base of the nail which persists as the perionyx, W^^nb The formation of the nail begins in the more proximal portion of the nail area and its further growth is by the addition of new keratinized cells to its proximal edge and lower surface, these cells being formed only in the proximal part of the nail bed in a region marked by its whit- ish color and termed the lunula. The first appearance of the nail-areas, at the tips of the digits as described by Zander has not yet been confirmed by later observers, but the migration of the areas to the dorsal surface neces- sitated by such a location of the primary differentiation affords an explanation of the otherwise anomalous cutaneous nerve-supply of the nail-areas in the adult, this being from the palmar (plantar) nerves. The Development of the Hairs. —The hairs begin to develop at about the third month and continue to be formed during the remaining portions of fetal life. They arise_as solid cylindrical downgrowtlis, pro- jecting obliquely into the subjacent dermis from the lower surface of Fig. 82.—Longitudinal* Section through the Nail Area in an Em- bryo OF 17 CM. cp, Eponychiiim; n, nail substance; nb, nail bed; sc, stratum cor- neum ; sp, sole plate.— (Okamura.)

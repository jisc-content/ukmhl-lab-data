DEVELOPMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLES. 19 neuroses, ligaments) represent portions of the muscular tissue of the lower form (Bardeleben). Many of the acces- sory ligaments occurring in connection with diarthrodial joints apparently owe their origin to a degeneration of muscle tissue, the fibular lateral ligament of the knee-joint, for instance, being probably a degenerated portion of the peroneus longus, while the sacro-tuberous ligament ap- pears to stand in a similar relation to the long head of the biceps femoris (Sutton). 6. Finally, there may be associated with any of the first four processes a change in the direction of the muscle-fibers. The original antero-posterior direction of the fibers is re- tained in comparatively few of the adult muscles and excel- lent examples of the process here referred to are to be found in the intercostal muscles and the muscles of the abdominal walls. In the musculature associated with the branchial arches the alteration in the direction of the fibers occurs even in the fishes, in which the original direction of the muscle-fibers is very perfectly retained in other myotomes, the branchial muscles, however, being arranged parallel with the branchial cartilages or even passing dorso-ventrally be- tween the upper and lower portions of an arch, and so form- ing what may be regarded as a constrictor of the arch. This alteration of direction dates back so far that the con- strictor, arrangement may well be taken as the primary con- dition in studying the changes which the branchial muscu- lature has undergone in the mammalia. It would occupy too much space in a work of this kind to consider in detail the history of each one of the skeletal muscles of the human body, but a statement of the general plan of their development will not be out of place. For convenience the entire system may l)e divided into three portionsâ€”the cranial, trunk and limb musculature; and of these, the trunk musculature may first be considered.

DEVELOPMENT OF APPENDICULAR SKELETON. 197 lower part, the anterior of these giving rise to the pubis (p), while the posterior produces the ischium (is). At birth these three bones are still separated from one another by a Y-shaped piece of cartilage whose three limbs meet at the bottom of the acetabulum, but later a secondary center appears in this cartilage and unites the three bones together. The central part of the lower half of each original cartilage plate does not undergo complete chondri- lication, but remains mem- branous, constituting the obturator membrane which closes the obturator fora- men. In addition to the Y- shaped secondary center, other epiphysial centers appear in the prominent portions of the cartilage, such as the pubic crest (Fig. Ill, c), the ischial tuberosity ((/), the anterior inferior spine (b) and the crest of the ilium (a), and Fig. III.—The Ossification Centers OF THE Os InNOMINATUM. a, b, c, and d, Secondary centers for the crest, anterior inferior spine, symphysis, and ischial tuberosity; il, ilium; is, ischium; p, pubis.— (Tcsttit.) unite with the rest of the bone at about the twentieth year. The femur, tibia, and iibula each develop from a single primary center for the shaft and an upper and a lower epiphysial center, the femur possessing, in addition, epi- physial centers for the greater and lesser trochanters (Fig. 91). The patella does not belong to the same category as the other bones, but resembles the pisiform bone of the carpus in being a sesamoid bone, developed in the tendon

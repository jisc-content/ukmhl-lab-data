172 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRA AND RIBS. tebra. The epistropheus consequently is formed by one and a half sclerotomes, while but half a one constitutes the atlas. The extent to which the ribs are developed in connec- tion with the various vertebrae also varies considerably. Throughout the cervical region they are short, the upper five or six being no longer than the transverse processes, with the tips of which their extremities unite at an early stage. In the upper five or six vertebrae a relatively large interval persists between the rib and the transverse process, forming the vertebral foramen, through which the vertebral vessels pass, but in the seventh vertebra the fusion is more extensive and the foramen is very small and hardly notice- able. In the thoracic region the ribs reach their greatest development, the upper eight or nine extending almost to the mid-ventral line, where their extremities unite to form a longitudinal cartilaginous bar from which the sternum develops (see p. 175). The lower three or four thoracic ribs are successively shorter, however, and lead to the con- dition found in the lumbar vertebrae, where they are again greatly reduced and firmly united with the transverse proc- esses, the union being so close that only the tips of the latter can be distinguished, forming what are known as the accessory tubercles. In the sacral region the ribs are re- duced to short flat plates, which unite together to form the lateral masses of the sacrum, and, finally, in the coccygeal region the blastemic costal processes of the first vertebra unite with the transverse processes to form the transverse processes of the adult vertebra, but no indications of them are to be found in the other vertebrae beyond the blastemic stage. The third stage in the development of the axial skeleton begins with the ossification of the cartilages, and in each vertebra there are typically as many primary centers of ossification as there were originally cartilages, except that

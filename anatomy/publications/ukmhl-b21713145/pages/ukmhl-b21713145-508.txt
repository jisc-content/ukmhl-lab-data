THE VITREOUS HUMOR. 494 The Development of the Vitreous Humor.—\i has already been pointed out (p. 480) that a blood-vessel, the hyaloid artery, accompanied by some mesodermal tissue makes its way into the cavity of the optic cup through the chorioid fissure. On the closure of the fissure the artery becomes enclosed within the optic stalk and appears to penetrate the retina, upon the surface of which its branches ramify. In the embryo the artery does not, however, terminate in these branches as it does in the adult, but is continued on through Fig. 269.—Reconstruction of a Portion of the Eye of an Embryo OF 13.8 MM. ah, Hyaloid artery; ch, chorioid coat; lens; r, retina.— {His.) the cavity of the optic cup (Fig. 269) to reach the lens, around which it sends branches to form the tunica vasculosa lentis. According to some authors, the formation of the vitreous humor is closely associated with the development of this artery, the humor being merely a transudate from it, while others have maintained that it is a derivative of the meso- derm which accompanies the vessel, and is therefore to be regarded as a peculiar gelatinous form of connective tissue. More recently, however, renewed observations by several authors have resulted in the deposition ot the mesoderm from the chief role in the formation of the vitreous and the substitution in it of the retina.

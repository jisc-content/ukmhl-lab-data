THE JiRANCIIIAL EPITHELIAL BODIES. various bodies is that generally applied to the mammalian organs, but it would be better, for the sake of comparison with other vertebrates, to adopt the nomenclature proposed by Gro- schuif who terms each lateral thyreoid a thymus IV, whi e each thymus lobe is a thymus III. Similarly the parathyreoids Fig. 174—Diagram, showing the Origin of the Various Branchial Epithelial Bodies. Ith, Lateral thyreoids; />/», postbranchial bodies; pht^ and pht^, para- thyreoids; th, median thyreoid; thy, thymus; / to IV, branchial grooves.— (Kohn.) are termed parathymus III and IV, the term thyreoid being limited to the median thyreoid. The Musculature of the Pharynx.—The pharynx differs from other portions of the archenteron in the fact that its walls are furnished with.voluntary muscles, the principal of which are the constrictors and the stylo-pharyngeus. This peculiarity arises from the relations of the pharynx to the branchial arches. It has been seen that in the higher mam- malia the dorsal ends of the third, fourth, and fifth bran-

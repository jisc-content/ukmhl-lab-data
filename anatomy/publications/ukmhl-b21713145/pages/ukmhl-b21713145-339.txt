THE LIVER. represents the ductus choledochus (Fig. 181). mm., when the lumen again appears (Tandler). This process.' is interesting in connection with the occasional _occurrenc£_iii new-born children, of an atresia of the duodenum. " ■ — » The Development of the Liver.—The liver makes its appearance in embryos of about 3 mm. as a longitudinal groove upon the v_entral surface of the archenteron_ just Ijelow the stomach ^nd between it and the umbilicus. The endodermal cells lining- the anteri9|- yprtion of the groove early undergo a rapid proliferation, andform a solid mass which projects ventrally into the substance of a horizontal Fig. 180.—Reconstruction of a Portion of the Intestine of an Embryo OF 28 mm., showing the Longitudinal Folds from which the Villi are Formed.—(5(^rrj-.) the segtuiu trims_Y£i:sum__(see p. 337), attached to t]}e„veiitry_jvdLof_t^^^ This solid mass (Fig. 181, ^) form.the beginning of the liver proper, while the lower portion of the groove, which remains hollow, represents the future gall-bladder TFig. 181, B). Constrictions appe^: ing between the intestine and both the hepatic and cystic portions of the organ gradually separate these from the intestine, until they are nnited to it only by a stalk which

DEVELOPMENT OF THE STERNUM. 1/7 part of the_bodx, while the uppermost center_gives rise to_ the mamibriiim jhich frequently persists as a distinct bone united to the body by a hinge-joint. A failure of the cartilaginous bars to fuse produces the con- dition known as cleft sternum, or if the failure to fuse affects only a portion of the bars there results a perforated sternum. A perforation or notching of the xiphoid cartilage is of fre- FiG. 99.—Sternum of 14 mm. New-born Child, as, Alisphenoid; ho, basioccipital; hs, SHOWING Centers of basisphenoid; eo, exoccipital; m.

The suprasternal bones are the rudiments of a bone or carti- lage, the omosternum, situated in front of the manubrium in many of the lower mammalia. It furnishes the articular sur- faces for the clavicles and is possibly formed by a fusion of the ventral ends of the cartilages which represent those bones; hence its appearance as a pair of bones in the rudimentary condition.

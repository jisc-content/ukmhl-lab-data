I So DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL. chondrocranium, (2) membrane bones, and (3) cartilage unsegniental^chgodrocraniiinL phis four_vertebras, the latter being added to and incorporated with the occipital portion of the chondrocranium. Emphasis must be laid upon the fact that the cartilagi- nous portion of the skull forms only the base and lower portions of the sides of the cranium, its entire roof, as well as the face region, showing no indication of cartilage, the mesenchyme in these regions being converted into fibrous connective tissue, which, especially in the cranial region, assumes the form of a dense membrane. But in addition to the chondrocranium and the vertebrae incorporated with it, other cartilaginous elements enter into the composition of the skull. The mesenchyme which occupies the axis of each branchial arch undergoes more or less complete chondrification, cartilaginous bars being so formed, certain of which enter into very close relations with the skull. It has been seen (p. 82) that each half of the first arch gives rise to a maxillary process which grows forward and ventrally to form the anterior boundary of the mouth, while the remaining portion of the arch forms the mandibular process. The whole of the axis of the man- dibular process becomes chondrified, forming a rod known as Meckel's cartilage, and this, at its dorsal end, comes into relation with the periotic capsule, as does also the dorsal end of the cartilage of the second arch. In the remaining three arches cartilage forms only in the ventral portions, so that their rods do not come into relation with the skull, though it will be convenient to consider their further his- tory together with that of the other branchial arch carti- lages. The arrangement of these cartilages is shown dia- grammatically in Fig. 102. By the ossification of these various parts three categories of bones are formed: (i) cartilage bones formed in the

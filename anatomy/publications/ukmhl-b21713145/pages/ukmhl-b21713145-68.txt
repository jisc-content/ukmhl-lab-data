FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 54 uous with the persisting portions of the primary endoderm (Fig. 27, B). This layer, following the enveloping cells in their growth over the yolk-mass, gradually surrounds that structure so that it comes to lie within the archenteron. In some turtles, on the other hand, the disappearance of the floor of the invagination takes place at a very early stage of the infolding, the roof cells only persisting to grow e/i ^ Fig. 26.—Longitudinal Sections through Embryos of the Gecko, SHOWING GasTRULATION. ec, Ectoderm; en, secondary endoderm; en , primarj' endoderm; t>rm, prostomial mesoderm.— (iVill.) forward to form the dorsal wall of the archenteron. This interesting abbreviation of the process occurring in the gecko indicates the mode of development which is found in the mammalia. The existence of a prostomial mesoderm in connection with the primitive streak has already been noted, and when the invagination takes place it is carried forward as a nar-

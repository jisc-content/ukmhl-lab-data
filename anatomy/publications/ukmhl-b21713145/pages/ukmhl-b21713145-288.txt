2/4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. It is interesting to note that in many of the lower mammals the external jugular becomes of much greater importance than the internal, the latter in some forms, indeed, eventually disap- pearing and the blood from the interior of the skull emptying by means of anastomoses which have developed into the exter- nal jugular system. In man the primitive condition is re- tained, but indications of a transference of the intracranial blood to the external jugular are seen in the emissary veins. The posterior cardinal veins, or, as they may more simply be termed, the cardinals, extend backward from their union with the jugulars along the sides of the vertebral column, receiving veins from the mesentery and also from the vari- ous lateral segmental veins of the neck and trunk regions, with the exception of that of the first cervical segment which opens into the jugular. Later, however, as already described (p. 273), the cervical veins shift to the jugulars, as do also the first and second thoracic (intercostal) veins, but the remaining intercostals, together with the lumbars and sacrals, continue to open into the cardinals. In addi- tion, the cardinals receive in early stages the veins from the primitive kidneys (n:iesonephros), which are exceptionally large in the human embryo, but when they are replaced later on by the permanent kidneys (metanephros) their afferent veins undergo a reduction in number and size, and this, together with the shifting of the upper lateral veins, produces a marked diminution in the size of the cardinals. The changes by which they acquire their final arrangement are, however, so intimately associated with the development of the inferior vena cava that their description may be con- veniently postponed until the history of the omphalo-mesen- teric and umbilical veins has been presented. The omphah-:inesenteric veins are two in number, a right and a left, and pass in along the yolk-stalk until they reach the embryonic intestine, along the sides of which they pass forw-ard to unite with the corresponding umbilical veins.

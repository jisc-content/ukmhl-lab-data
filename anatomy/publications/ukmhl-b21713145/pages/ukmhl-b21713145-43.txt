29 THE MATURATION OF THE OVUM. gives a single chromosome to each of the two cells which result, so that each of these cells possesses half the number of chromosomes characteristic for the species. The second division, like the first, is unequal, one of the cells being relatively very large and constituting the mature ovum, while the other is small and is the second polar globule. Frequently the first polar globule divides during the forma- tion of the second one, a reduction of its dyads to single chromosomes taking place, so that as the final result of the maturation four cells are formed (Fig. 13), the mature ovum (o), and three polar globules (p), each of which con- tains half the number of chromosomes characteristic for the species. The similarity of the maturation phenomena to those of spermatogenesis may be perceived from the following diagram: n/'~N Spermato- I ) cyte I Oocyte II O O O O %Tu OvumO O 00 00 00 Spermatids Polar globules / In both processes the number of cells produced is the same and in both there is the same reduction of the chromosomes. But while each of the four spermatids is functional, the th ree polar globules are non-functional, and are to be re- garded as abortive ova, formed during the process of reduc- tion of the chromosomes only to undergo degeneration. In other words, three out of every four potential ova sacrifice

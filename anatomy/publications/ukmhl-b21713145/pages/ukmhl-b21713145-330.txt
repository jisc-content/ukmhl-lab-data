THE BRANCHIAL EPIJHELIAL BODIES. 3i6 From the posterior wall of the third branchial groove a pair of evaginations develop, similar to those which produce the lateral thyreoids. These_elongate greatly, and growing downward ventrally to the thyreoid and separating from ' their points of origin, come to lie below the thyreoids, form- ing the thymus gland (Fig. 172, thy). As development proceeds they pass further bacl:ward and come eventually to rest upon the anterior surface of the pericardium. The cavity which they at first contain is early obliterated and the glands assume a lobed appearance and become traversed by trabeculae of connective tissue. Lymphocytes, derived,, ac^ cording to some recent observalions, djrectly from the epi- thehum of the glands, make theii^appearance and gradually increase in number until_the_ original epithelial cells are rep- resented only by a number of peculiar spherical structures, consisting of cells arranged in concentric^layers and_kiiown as Hassall's corpuscles. The glands increase in size until about the fifteenth year, after which they gradually undergo degeneration into a mass of fibrous and adipose tissue. Finally, a pair of outgrowths arise from the floor of the pharynx just behind the, fifth branchial arch, in the region where the fifth groove, if developed, would occur. These post-branchial bodies, as they have been called, usually undergo degeneration at an early stage and disappear com- pletely, though occasionally they persist as cystic structures embedded in the substance of the thyreoid. The relation of these various structures to the branchial grooves is shown by the annexed diagram (Fig. 174) ; and from it, it will be seen that the bodies derived from the third and fourth grooves are serially equivalent. Comparative em- bryology makes this fact still more evident, since, in the lower vertebrates, each branchial groove contributes to the formation of the thymus gland. The terminology used above for the

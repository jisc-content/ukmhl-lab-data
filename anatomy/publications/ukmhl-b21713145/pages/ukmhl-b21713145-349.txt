'335 CHAPTER XI THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERICARDIUM, THE PLEURO-PERITONEUM AND THE DIAPHRAGM. It has been seen (p. 241) that the heajt makes its appear- ance at a stage when the greater portion of the ventral sur- face of the intestine is still open to the yolk-sac. The ven- tral mesoderm splits to form the somatic and splanchnic layers" and the heart developgi'^as a fold in the latte?^on each side of the median line, projecting into the coelomic cavity enclosed by the two layers (Fig. 130, As the constric- tion of the anterior part of the embryo proceeds the two heart folds are brought nearer together and later meet, so. that_the heart becomes a cylindrical structure lxing_in_the median line of the body and is suspended in the coelom by a ventral band, the ventral mesocardium, composed of two layers of splanchnic mesoderm which extend to it from the ventral wall of the body, and by a similar band, the dorsal mesocardium, which unites it with the splanchnic mesoderm surrounding the digestive^Jract. The ventral mesocardium soon disappears (Fig. 130, C) and the'dorsarone also van- ishes somewhat later, so that the heart comes to lie freely in the coelomic cavity, except for the connections which it makes with the body-walls by the vessels which enter and arise from it. The coelomic cavity of the embryo does not at first com- municate with the extra-embryonic coelom^ which is formed at a very early period (see p. 69), but later^whenTheTplit- ting of the embryonic mesoderm takes place the two cavities

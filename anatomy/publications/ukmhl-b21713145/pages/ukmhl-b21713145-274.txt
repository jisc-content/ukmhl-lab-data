DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 26o the omphalo-mesenteric artery of the embryo and arises from the aorta by two, three or more roots, which corre- spond to the fifth, fourth and higher thoracic segments!^ Later, all but the lowest of the roots disappear and the per- sisting one undergoes a downward migration in accordance with_^he_ recession of the diaphragm and viscera (see p. 342), until in embryos of 17 mm. it lies opposite the^rst lumbar segment. Similarly the coeliac and inferior mesen- teric arteries, which when first recognizable in embryos of 9^ mm. correspond with the fourth and twelfth thoracic segments respectively, also undergo a secondary downward migration, the coeliac artery in embryos of 17 mm. arising opposite the twelfth thoracic and the inferior mesenteric opposite the third lumbar segment. One of the pairs of visceral branches becomes especially enlarged to form the umbilical arteries of the embryo. It seems probable that, like the omphalo-mesenterics, each of these arteries primarily arises from. the aorta by several segmental roots, but in the earliest stage in which it has been observed it arises by a single root from the third lum- bar segment (Fig. 145, U'). Each artery passes forward along the sides of the intestine, ventral to the Wolffian duct (see p. 361), and is thence continued out along the allantois to the chorionic villi. Later this original stem is joined, not far from its origin, by what appears to be the lateral somatic branch of the fifth lumbar segment, whereupon the proximal part of the original umbilical vessel degenerates and the umbilical comes to arise from the somatic branch, whicli_^ the common iliac artery of adult anatomy (Fig. 145). Hence it is that this vessel in the adult gives origin both to branches such as the external iliac, the gluteal, the sciatic and the internal pudendal, which are distributed to the body walls or their derivatives, and to others, such as

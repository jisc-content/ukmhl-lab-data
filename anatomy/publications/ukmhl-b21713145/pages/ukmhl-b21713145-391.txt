377 THE GENITAL DUCTS. but resemble closely the medullary cords with which they are serially homologous. They separate from the epithe- lium and make connections with the glomeruli of the ante- rior portion of the mesonephros, on the one hand, and on the other with the medullary cords, and in later stages show a tendency to break up into primary follicles, which early degenerate and disappear like those of the medullary cords. The Transformation of the Mesonephros and the Ducts.—At one period of development there are present, as representatives of the urinogenital apparatus, the Wolffian body (mesonephros) and its duct, the Miillerian duct, and the developing ovary or testis. Such a condition forms an indifferent stage from which the development proceeds in one of two directions according as the genital ridge be- comes a testis or an ovary, the Wolffian body in part under- going degeneration and in part persisting to form organs which for the most part are rudimentary, while in the female the Wolffian duct also degenerates except for certain rudiments and in the male the Miillerian duct behaves similarly. In the Male.—It has been seen that the upper portion of the Wolffian body, through the rete cords, enters into very intimate relations with the testis, and may be regarded as divided into two portions, an upper genital and a lower excretory. In the male the genital portion persists in its entirety, serving as the efferent ducts of the testis, which, beginning in the spaces of the rete testis, already shown to be connected with the capsules of Bowman, open into the upper part of the Wolffian duct and form the globus major of the epididymis. The excretory portion undergoes ex- tensive degeneration, a portion of it persisting as a mass of coiled tubules ending blindly at both ends, situated near the head of the epididymis and known as the pjwadidymis. or organ oi^raidewhile a single elongated tubule, aris- 33

434 THE OLFACTORY LOBES. Structure, the olfactory lobe (Fig. 219, VI 3). In most of the lower mammaha these lobes reach a very consider- able size, and consequently have been regarded as consti- tuting an additional division of the brain, known as the rhinencephalon, but in man they remain smaller, and al- though they are at first hollow, containing prolongations from the lateral ventricles, the cavities later on disappear and the lobes become solid.^ Each lobe becomes differen- tiated into two portions, its terminal portion becoming con- verted into the club-shaped structure, the olfactory bulb and stalk, while its proximal portion gives rise to the olfactory tracts, the trigone, and the anterior perforated substance. Histogenesis of the Cerebral Cortex.—A satisfactory study of the histogenesis of the cortex has not yet been made. In embryos of three months a marginal velum is present and probably gives rise to the stratum zonale of the adult brain; beneath this is a cellular layer, perhaps representing the mantle layer; beneath this, again, a layer of nerve-fibers is beginning to appear, representing the white substance of the pallium; and, finally, lining the ventricle is an ependymal layer. In embryos of the fifth month, toward the innermost part of the second layer, cells are beginning to differentiate into the large pyramidal cells, but almost nothing is known as to the origin of the other layers recognizable in the adult cortex, nor is it known whether any migration, similar to what occurs in the cere- bellar cortex, takes place. The fibers of the white sub- stance do not begin to acquire their myelin sheaths until toward the end of the ninth month, and the process is not completed until some time after birth (Flechsig), while the fibers of the cortex continue to undergo myelination until comparatively late in life (Kaes). The Development of the Spinal Nerves.—It has already been seen that there is a fundamental difYerence in the mode

92 AGE OF EMBRYO AT DIFFERENT STAGES. tion and from what has been said in previous pages (pp. 35, 36) it is evident that it must be exceedingly difficult to determine the exact age of any embryo even when the time of the cessation of the menses and the date of the coition which resulted in the pregnancy are known. And, further- more, not only is the actual date of the beginning of devel- opment uncertain, but in the majority of the known human embryos in early stages the time of the cessation of develop- ment is also more or less uncertain, since the embryos are abortions and their expulsion need not necessarily have im- mediately succeeded their death. These various sources of uncertainty are of especial im- portance in the early stages of development, when a day more or less means much. But nevertheless it is conve- nient to have some estimate of the age of such embryos even thoug'h it be recog^iized that any date given is a mere approximation. His has made an estimate of the age of a number of embryos concerning which approximate data were available with results which are stated in the follow- ing table: At 2-22 weeks the embryo measures 2.2- 3 mm. in length. " 2*-3 " " " 3 - 4-5 mm. " 3* " " "5-6 mm. " 4 " " "7-8 mm. ^' 4i " " " 10 -II mm. " 5 " " " 13 mm. It must be borne in mind, however, that embryos of the same age need not in all cases be of the same length, since conchtions of nutrition, etc., will largely determine not only the size of the embryo, but also the amount of its develop- ment. And, furthermore, it seems probable that the esti- mates for age given in the above table may be too small, since there is reason to believe that the earlier stages of development proceed more slowly than do the later ones.

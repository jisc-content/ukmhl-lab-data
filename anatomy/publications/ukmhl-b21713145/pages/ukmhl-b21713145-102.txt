DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACE. 88 early development has already been traced. In an embryo measuring 8 mm. in length (Fig. 52) the fossa (os) has assumed a somewhat irregular quadrilateral form. Its pos- terior boundary is formed by the mandibular processes of the first arch, while laterally it is bounded by the maxillary processes (mxp) and anteriorly by the free edge of a median plate, termed the nasal process, which on either side i -piG. 53.—Face of Embryo after the Completion of the Upper Jaw.— (His.) of the median line is elevated to form a marked protuber- ance, the processus globulans (pg). The ventral ends of the maxillary processes are widely separated, the nasal process and the processus globulares intervening between them, and they are also separated from the globular proc--

238 THE FORMATION OF TTIfi BLOOD. o^f the individual, so that there is a necessity for the forma- tion of new corpuscle:^ and for the existence of hrcmato- poietic organs at all stages of Hfe. In the fetus erxthrocytes in process of division may be found in the generaUjrculation and even in the heart itself, but they are much more plentiful in places where the blood-pressure is diminished, as, for in- stance, in the larger capillaries of the lower limbs and in the capil- laries of all the visceral oi;gans^ and of the sub- cutaneous tissues. Cer- tain organs, however, such as the Jiyer, the S£leen^_ and the Jjone^ marrow, present especi- ally favorable conditions for the multiplication of the blood-cells, and in these not only are the capillaries enlarged so as to afford resting-places for the corpuscles, but gaps appear in the walls of the vessels through which the blood-elements may pass and so come into intimate relations with the actual tissues of the organs (Fig. 127). After birth the hcematopoietic function of the liver ceases and that of the spleen becomes limited to the formation of white corpuscles, though the complete function may be re-established in cases of extreme anaemia. The bone-marrow, however, retains the function completely, being throughout life the seat of formation of both red and white corpuscles, the lymphatic nodes and folHcles, as well Fig. 127.—Section of a Portion of the Liver of a Rabbit Embryo of 5 mm. e, Erythrocytes in the liver substance and in a capillary; //, hepatic cells.— {van der S trie Jit.)

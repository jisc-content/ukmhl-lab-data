208 DEVELOPMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLES. oblique and the transverse layers of the abdominal walls, and by the intercostal muscles and the transversus of the thorax. 3. A fusion of portions of successive myotomes to form a single muscle, again a process of frequent occurrence, and well illustrated by the rectus abdominis (which is formed by the fusion of the ventral portions of the last six or seven thoracic myotomes) or by the superficial portions of the erector spinas. 4. A migration of parts of one or more myotomes over others. An example of this process is to be found in the latissimus dorsi, whose history has already been referred to, and it is also beautifully shown by the serratus anterior and the trapezius, both of which have extended far beyond the limits of the segments from which they are derived. 5. A degeneration of portions or the whole of a myotome. This process has played a very considerable part in the evo- lution of the muscular system in'^the vertebrates. When a muscle normally degenerates, it becomes converted into con- nective tissue, and many of the strong aponeurotic sheets which occur in the body owe their origin to this process. Thus, for example, the aponeurosis connecting the occipital and frontal portions of the occipito-frontalis is due to this process and is muscular in such forms as the lower monkeys, and a good example is also to be found in the aponeurosis which occupies the interval between the superior and inferior serrati postici, these two muscles being continuous in lower forms. The strong lumbar aponeurosis and the aponeu- roses of the oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen are also good examples. Indeed, in comparing one of the mammals with a mem- ber of one of the lower classes of vertebrates, the greater amount of connective tissue compared with the amount of muscular tissue in the former is very striking, the inference being that these connective-tissue structures (fascine, apo-

OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. 18/ later portions of the fifth month, and during the sixth month these unite together to form a single center from which the complete ossification of the cartilage proceeds to form the petrous and mastoid portions of the temporal bone (Fig. io6, p). The mastoid process does not really form until several years after birth, being produced by the hollowing and bulging out of a portion of the petrous bone by out- growths from the lining membrane of the middle ear. The cavities so formed are the mastoid cells, and their relations to the middle-ear cavity are in all respects similar to those of /'^^'^'Tr^''^77T^ the ethmoidal and sphenoidal ' '// / cells to the nasal cavities. The ' V ^ remaining portions of the tem- ^"~^\\v'^/ poral bone are partly formed by membrane bone and partly from the branchial arch skeleton.

Finally, the styloid process is developed from the upper part of the second branchial arch, whose history will be consid- ered later. The various ossifications which form in the chondrocra-

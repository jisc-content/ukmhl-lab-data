284 â€¢THE FETAL CIRCULATION. as thejtarting-point, the blood passes along the umbilical vein to enter the body of the fetus at the umbilicus, whence it passes forward in the free edge of the anterior mesentery (see p. 341) until it reaches the liver. Here, owing to the anastomoses between the umbilical and omphalo-mesenteric veins, a portion of the blood traverses the substance of the liver to open by the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava, while the remainder passes on through the ductus venosus to the cava, the united streams opening into the right atrium. This blood, whose purity is only slightly reduced by mixture with the blood returning from the infe- rior vena cava, is prevented from passing into the right ven- tricle by the Eustachian valve, which directs it to the fora- men ovale, and through this it passes into the left atrium, thence to the left ventricle, and so out by the systemic aorta. The blood which has been sent to the head, neck, and upper extremities is returned by the superior vena cava also into the right atrium, but this descending stream opens into the atrium to the right of the annulus jof Vieussens (see Fig. 135) and j>asses directly to the right ventricle without mingling to any great extent with the blood returning by way of the inferior cava. From the right ventricle this blood passes out by the pulmonary artery; but the lungs at this period are collapsed and in no condition to receive any great amount of blood, and so the stream passes by way of the ductus arteriosus into the systemic aorta, meeting there the placental blood just below the point where the left subclavian artery is given off. From this point onward the aorta contains only mixed blood, and this is distributed to the walls of the thorax and abdomen and to the lungs and abdominal viscera, the greater part of it, however, passing off in the hypogastric arteries and so out again to the placenta. It will be perceived that although no portion of the body

154 DEVELOPMENT OF THE HAIRS. growth of the hair takes place by the addition to its basal portion of new keratinized cells, probably produced by the multiplication of the epidermal cells which en- velop the papilla. From the cells which form the lining of each follicle an outgrowth takes place into the surrounding dermis to form a sebaceous gland, which is at first solid and club-shaped, though later it becomes lobed. The central cells of the out- growth separate from the peripheral and from one another, and, their protoplasm undergoing a fatty degeneration, they finally pass out into the space between the follicle walls and the hair and so reach the surface, the peripheral cells later giving rise by division to new generations of central cells. During fetal life the fatty material thus poured out upon the surface of the body becomes mingled with the cast-off epitrichial cells and constitutes the white oleaginous sub- stance, the vernix caseosa, which covers the surface of the new-born child. The muscles, arrectores pilorum, connected with the hair follicles arise from the mesenchyme cells of the surrounding dermis. The first growth of hairs forms a dense covering over the entire surface of the fetus, the hairs which compose it being exceedingly fine and silky and constituting what is termed the lanugo. This growth is cast off soon after birth, except over the face, where it is hardly noticeable on account of its extreme fineness and lack of coloration. The coarser hairs which replace it in certain regions of the body probably arise from new follicles, since the formation of follicles takes place throughout the later periods of fetal life and possibly after birth. But even these later formed hairs do not individually persist for any great length of time, but are continually being shed, new or secondary hairs normally developing in their places. The shedding of a hair is pre- ceded by a cessation of the proliferation of the cells cover-

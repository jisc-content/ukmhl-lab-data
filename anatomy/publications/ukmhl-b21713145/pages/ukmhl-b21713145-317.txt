DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH. 3^3 birth, while that of the third is delayed until about the fifth year. As the tooth-germs increase in size, they approach nearer and nearer to the surface of the jaw, and at the same time the enamel organs separate from the dental shelf until their connection with it is a mere neck of epithelial cells. In the meantime the dental shelf itself has been undergoing degen- eration and is reduced to a reticulum which eventually com- pletely disappears, though fragments of it may occasionally persist and give rise to various malformations. With the disappearance of the last remains of the shelf, the various tooth-germs naturally lose all connection with one another. It will be seen, from what has been said, that each tooth- germ consists of two portions, one of which, the enarnel organ, is derived from the ectoderm, while jthe other, the ■ — — ■ ■ I . .. — _^ dental papilla, is mesenchymatous. Each of these gives rise to a definite portion of the fully formed tooth, the enamel organ, as its name indicates, producing the enamel, while from the dental papilla the dentine and pulp are formed. The cells of the enamel organ which are in contact with the surface of the papilla, at an early stage assume a cylin- drical form and become arranged in a definite layer, the enamel membrane (Fig. i66, SEi), while the remaining cells (SEa) apparently degenerate eventually, though they persist for a time to form what has been termed the enamel pulp. The formation of the enamel seems to be due to the direct transformation of the enamel cells, the process begin- ning at the basal portion of each cell, and as a result, the enamel consists of a series of prisms, each of which repre- sents one of the cells of the enamel membrane. The trans- formation proceeds until the cells have become completely converted into enamel prisms, except at their very tips, which form a thin membrane, the enamel cuticle, which is shed soon after the eruption of the teeth.

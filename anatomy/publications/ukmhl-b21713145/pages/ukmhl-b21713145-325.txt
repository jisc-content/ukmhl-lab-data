THE PHARYNX. the glands. A lumen early appears in the duct portions of the structures, the alveoli remaining solid for a longer time, although they eventually also become hollow. It is to be noted that each parotid and submaxillary consists of a single primary outgrowth, and is therefore a single struc- ture and not a union of a number of originally separate parts. The sublingual glands of adult anatomy are usually described as opening upon the floor of the mouth by a number of separate ducts. This arises from the fact that the majority of the glands which fonn in the vicinity of the opening of Wharton's duct remain quite small, only one of them on each side giving rise to the sublingual gland proper. The small glands have been termed the alveolo-lingual glands, and each one of them is equivalent to a parotid or submaxillary gland. In other words, there are in reality not three pairs of salivary glands, but from fourteen to sixteen pairs, there being usually from eleven to thirteen alveolo-lingual glands on each side. The Development of the Pharynx.—The phaynx rep- resents the most anterior part of the archenteron, that por- tion in which the branchial arches develop, and in the embryo it is relatively much longer than in the adult, the diminu- tion being brought about by the folding in of the posterior arches and the formation of the sinus prsecervicalis already described (p. 86). Between the various branchial arches, grooves occur, representing the endodermal portions of the, grooves which separate the arches. During development the first of these becomes converted into th^^iipanic cavity ofjhe^ear and the Eustachian tube (see Chapter XV) ; the second disappears in itsfupper part, the lower^ersisting as ^ the^ fossa in which the tonsjlJs_situatedT^wiiik ^ '2HJi_^Li^tJ[?''^\^"'^"'i§^ two are represented by the sinus P^^^f.^IE^^s 9.1-th?-larynx (His), and also leave traces of their existence in detached portions of their epithelium which form what are termed the branchial epithelial bodies, and take part in the formation oTlhe thvreoj£anHJj^.^rnM^ glands. ^ -

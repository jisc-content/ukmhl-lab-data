ii6 THE AMNION. When the bending downward of the peripheral portions of the embryonic disk to close in the ventral surface of the embryo occurs, the line of attachment of the amnion to the disk is also carried ventrally (Fig. 63, B), so that when the constriction off of the embryo is practically completed, Fig. 63.â€”Diagrams Illustrating the Formation of the Umbilical Cord. The heavy black Hne represents the embryonic ectoderm; the dotted Hne represents the Hne of reflexion of the body ectoderm into that of the amnion. Ac, Amniotic cavity; Al, allantois; Be, extra- embryonic coelom; Bs, belly-stalk; Ch, chorion; P, placenta; Uc, umbilical cord; V, chorionic villi; Ys, yolk-sac. the amnion is attached anteriorly to the margin of the umbilicus and posteriorly to the extremity of the band of ectoderm lining what may now be considered the posterior surface of the belly-stalk, while at the sides it is attached

What is shown there is only the upper portions of the post-axial bands, their lower por- tions extending downward on the anterior surface of the leg. Only the sacral bands, however, extend throughout the entire length of the limb into the foot, the second lum- FiG. 118.—Diagram of a Segment of the Body and Limb. hi, Axial blastema; dm, dorsal musculature of trunk; rl, nerve to limb; s, septum between dorsal and ventral trunk musculature; str.d, dorsal layer of limb musculature; tr.d and tr.v, dorsal and ventral divisions of a spinal nerve; vm, ventral musculature of the trunk.— (Kollmann.) bar band passing down only to about the middle of the thigh, the third to about the knee, the fourth to about the middle of the crus and the fifth as far as the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and the same is true of the corre- sponding prseaxial bands, which descend from the ventral surface of the os coxae (innominatum) along the inner and posterior surfaces of the leg to the same points.

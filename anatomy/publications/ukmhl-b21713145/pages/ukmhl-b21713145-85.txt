From the more median or axial por- tion the embryo proper will develop, and this portion is now shaped somewhat like the body of a violin and presents at its posterior portion the remains of the primitive streak, near the anterior end of which is a distinct pore, the open- ino- of what is termed the nciirenteric canal (nc), whose Fig. 39.â€”Diagrams Illustrating the Constriction of the Embryo FROM THE Yolk-sac. A and C are longitudinal, and B and D transverse sections. B is drawn to a larger scale than the other figures. significance has already been discussed (p. 60). More anteriorly two longitudinal ridges have appeared, the first indications of which are termed the medullary folds. In later stages a separation or constriction of the embryo from the yolk-sac begins and results in the transformation of the discoidal embryonic portion of the embryonic disk into a cylindrical structure. Primarily this depends upon the deepening of the furrow which surrounds the embryonic area, the edges of this area l^eing tlius bent in on all sides

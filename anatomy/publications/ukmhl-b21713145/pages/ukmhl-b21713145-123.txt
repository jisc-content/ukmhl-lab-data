109 METAMERISM. meres, each more or less closely resembling its fellows, and succeeding one another at regular intervals. Each somite differentiates, as has been stated, into a sclerotome and a myotome, and, accordingly, there will primarily be as many vertebrae and muscle segments as there are mesodermic somites, or, in other words, 'the^xi^Lskdetm^^ untary muscles of theji'unk are primajjlyjnetamerjc^* Nor Fig. 61.—Diagrams Illustrating the History of the Gastral Mesoderm.

Since each metamere is a distinct unit, it must possess its own supply of nutrition, and hence the primary arrangement of the blood-vessels is also metameric, a branch passing off on either side from the main longitudinal arteries and veins to each metamere. And, further, each pair of muscle segments receives its own nerves, so that the arrange- ment of the nerves, again, is distinctly metameric.

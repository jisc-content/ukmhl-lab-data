258 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. From the entire length of the thoracic aorta, and in the embryo from the aortic arches, lateral branches arise corre- sponding to each seg- tCc ment and accompany- ing the segmental nerves. The first of these branches arises just below the point of union of the vessel of the sixth arch with the dorsal trunk and accompanies the hypo- glossal nerve (Fig. 144, /z), and that which ac- companies the seventh cervical nerve arises just above the point of union of the two aortic arches (Fig. 144, s), and_ extends out into the limb bud, forming the subclavian artery.* Further downtsvelve pairs of lateral branches, arising from the tho- racic portion of the aorta, represent the in- tercostal arteries, and still lower four pairs of arteries Fig. 143.â€”Diagram Illustrating the Changes in the Branchial Arch Vessels. a, aorta; da, ductus arteriosus; ec, ex- ternal carotid; ic, internal carotid; pa, pulmonary artery; sc, subclavian; I-VI, aortic arch vessels. 1 u m b a r artcnes are formed, the fifth lumbars being represented by_two large branches, the common iliacs, which seem from their size to * It must be remembered that the right subclavian of the adult is more than equivalent to the left, since it represents the fourth branchial vessel + a portion of the dorsal longitudinal trunk -f- the lateral seg- mental branch (see Fig. 142).

314 THE BRANCHIAL EPITHELIAL BODIES. divide transversely to form follicles. When the embryo has reached a length of 2.6 cm., a cylindrical outgrowth arises from the anterior surface of the mass, usually a little to the left of the median line, and extends up the neck a varying distance, forming, when it persists until adult life, the so-called pyramid of the thyreoid body. This account of the pyramid follows the statements made by recent workers on the question (Tourneux and Verdun) ; His B, Fig. 172.—Reconstructions of the Branchial Epithelial Bodies OF Embryos of (A) 14 mm. and (B) 26 mm. ao, Aorta; Itli, lateral thyreoid; ph, pharynx; pth"^ and pth', parathy- reoids; th, thyreoid; thy, thymus; vc, vena cava superior.—(ToMr- neux and Verdun.) has claimed that it is the remains of the stalk connecting the thyreoid with the floor of the pharynx, and which he terms the thyreo-glossal duct. In addition to this median structure, one of the pairs of the lateral evaginations also takes part in the formation of the thyreoid body. These are the hteral thyreoids (Fig. 172, Ith), and they arise from the posterior wall of the fourth branchial furrow, in embryos of about 8 mm. Sepa- rating from the furrow, they migrate backward to fuse, in embryos of about 16 mm., with the posterior surface of the lateral portions of the median thyreoid. They form, how-

Along the line of its junction with the primary endoderm it gives rise to the plates of gastral mesoderm (Fig. 27), while the remainder of it produces Fig. 57.—Transverse Sections THROUGH Mole Kmbryos, showing THE Formation of the Notochord. ec, Ectoderm; en, endoderm; m, mesoderm; nc, notochord.—(Heape.) chorda dorsalis and on this account is sometimes termed the chorda endoderm. After the separation of the plates of gastral mesoderm the chorda endoderm, which is at first a flat band, becomes some- what curved (Fig. 57, A), so that it is concave on its under surface, and, the curvature increasing, the edges of the plate come into contact and finally fuse together (Fig, 57, B), the edges of the primary endoderm at the same time uniting beneath the chordal tube so formed, so this layer becomes a continuous sheet, as it was at its first appearance. The lumen which is at first present in the chordal tube is soon obliterated by the enlargement of the cells which bound it,

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUDORIPAROUS GLANDS. 155 ing the dermal papilla and by a shrinkage of the papilla, whereby it becomes detached from the hair, and the replac- ing hair arises from a papilla which is probably budded of¥ from the older one before its degeneration and carries with it a cap of epidermal cells. It is uncertain whether the cases of excessive de- velopment of hair over the face and upper part of the body which occasionally oc- cur are due to an excessive development of the later hair follicles (hypertricho- sis) or to a persistence and continued growth of the lanugo. The Development of the Sudoriparous Glands.—The sudoripar- ous glands arise during the fifth month as solid cylindrical outgrowths from the primary ridges of the epi- dermis (Fig. 84), and at first project vertically downward into the subjacent dermis. Later, however, the lower end of each downgrowth is thrown into coils, and at the same time a lumen appears in the center. Since, however, the -cylinders are formed from the deeper layers of the epider- mis, their lumina do not at first open upon the surface, but gradually approach it as the cells of the deeper layers of the epidermis replace those which are continually being cast off from the surface of the stratum corneum. The final open- ing to the surface occurs during the seventh month of development. The Development of the Mammary Glands.—In the majority of the lower mammals a number of mammary glands occur, arranged in two longitudinal rows, and it has Fig. 84.—Lower Surface of a De- tached Portion of Epidermis FROM the Dorsum of the Hand. h, Hair follicle; s, sudoriparous gland.— (Blaschko.)

II PART 1. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. CHAPTER 1. THE SPERMATOZOON AND SPERMATOGENESIS; THE OVUM AND ITS MATURATION AND FERTILIZATION. The Spermatozoon.â€”The human spermatozoon (Fig. 4) is a minute and greatly elongated cell, measuring about 0,05 mm, in length and consisting of an anterior broader portion or head (k) and a narrow thread-like tail (/). The head measures about 0.005 mm. in length and when viewed from one surface (Fig, 4, i) has an oval outline, though since it is somewhat flattened or concave toward the tip, it has a pyriform shape when seen in profile (Fig, 4, 2). The tail consists of several portions. Situated immediately behind the head is a short cylindrical portion measuring 0,006 mm. in length which is termed the middle-piece or neck (w), and behind this is the flagellum, of about the same diameter as the middle-piece, but forming about four fifths (0.04 mm,) of the entire length of the spermatozoon. The axis of the flagellum is formed by a delicate filament which projects somewhat beyond the flagellum, forming what is termed the terminal filament or end-piece {e). In addition to these various parts, the spermatozoa of many mammalia possess a head-cap (Fig. 5, he) covering the anterior end of the head, and a spiral membrane wound around the flagellum. The presence of these structures has not yet been

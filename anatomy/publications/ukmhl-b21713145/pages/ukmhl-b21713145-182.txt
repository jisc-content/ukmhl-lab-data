The Development of the Vertebras and Ribs.—The mesenchyme formed from the sclerotome of each meso- dermic somite grows inward toward the median line and forms a mass lying between the notochord and the myotome, separated from the similar mass in front and behind by some loose tissue in which lies an intersegmental artery. Towards the end of the third week of development the cells of the posterior portion of each sclerotome condense to a tissue more compact than that of the anterior portion (Fig. 93), and a little later the two portions become separated by a cleft.

The looser tissue of the anterior half of the sclerotome also grows medially to surround the notochord, filling up the intervals between successive denser portions, and it forms too a membrane extending between successive vertebral arches. Later the tissue surrounding the noto-

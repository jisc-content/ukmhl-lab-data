THE CORPUS CALLOSUM. on the mesial surface of the hemispheres, lying parallel to the anterior portion of the hippocampus fissure and divid- ing the mesial surface into the gyri marginalis and forni- catus. A little later, at the beginning of the sixth month, several other fissures make their appearance upon the outer surface of the pallium, the chief of these being the central sulcus, the inter-parietal, the pre- and post-central, and the temporal sulci, the most ventral of these last running paral- lel with the lower portion of the hippocampal fissure and diflfering from the others in forming a ridge on the wall of the ventricle termed the collateral eminence, whence the fissure is known as the collateral. The position of most of these fissures may be seen from Fig. 236, and for a more complete description of them reference may be had to text- books of descriptive anatomy. In later stages numerous tertiary fissures make their appearance and mask more or less extensively the seconda- ries, than which they are, as a rule, much more inconstant in position and shallower. The Corpus Callosum and Fornix.â€”While these fissures have been forming, important structures have developed in connection with the lamina terminalis. Up to about the fourth month the lamina is thin and of nearly uniform thickness throughout, but at this time it begins to thicken near its dorsal edge and fibers appear in the thickening, converting it into the anterior commissure. Immediately above and in front of the upper edge of the lamina ter- minalis the medial walls of the two cerebral hemispheres come into contact and fuse, and the area of fusion soon becomes continuous with the thickened upper edge of the lamina (Fig. 237). In later stages the area of''concres- cence of the hemispheres extends both anteriorly and pos- teriorly and assumes the form of a triangle with its apex directed backwards. In the dorsal portion of the triano-le

121 THE ALLANTOIS AND BELLY-STALK. But this does not account for all the peculiarities of the human allantois. In the birds, and indeed in the lower oviparous mammals, the endodermal portion of the allan- tois is equally developed with the mesodermal portion, the allantois being an extensive sac whose cavity is filled with fluid, and this is also true of such mammals as the marsu- pials, the rabbit, and the ruminants. In man, however, the endodermal diverticulum never becomes a sac-like structure, but is a slender tube extending from the intestine to the chorion and Iving in the substance of the mesoderm of the belly-stalk (Fig. 63, D), th^ greater portion of which is to be regarded as homologous with the relatively thin layjer of splanchnic mesoderm coyerin^ the endodermal diverticu- .lum of the chick. _ An explanation of this disparity in the development of the mesodermal and endodermal portions of the human allantois is perhaps to be found in the altered conditions under which the respiration and secretion take place. In all forms, the lower as well as the higher, it is the mesoderm which is the more important constituent of the allantois, since in it the blood-vessels, upon whose pres- ence the physiological functions depend, arise and are em- bedded. In the birds and oviparous mammals there are no means by which excreted material can be passed to the exte- rior of the ovum, and it is, therefore, stored up within the cavity of the allantois, the allantoic fluid containing consid - erable quantities of nitrogen, indicating the presence of urea. In the higher mammals the intimate relations which develop between the chorion and the uterine walls allow of the passage of excreted fluids into the maternal blood; and the more intimate these relations, the less necessity there is for an allantoic cavity in which excreted fluid may be stored up. The difference in the development of the cavity in the ruminants, for example, and man depends probably upon the greater intimacy of the union between ovum and 12

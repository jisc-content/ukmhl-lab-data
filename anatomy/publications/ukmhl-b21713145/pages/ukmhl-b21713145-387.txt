373 THE TESTIS. eventually almost disappears. Shortly after the appearance of the albiiginea the sex-cords become broken up into more or less spherical masses and the rete-cords grow backwards into the axial substance of the testis (Fig. 208), develop a lumen and send off branches, one of which becomes con- nected'with each of the masses formed from the sex-cords. The rete-cords have also come into connection with the glomeruli of the anterior portion of the mesonephros and, like the sex-cords, have separated from the epithelium which Fig. 208.—Section through the Testis and the Broad Ligament of THE Testis of an Embryo of 5.5 mm. ep, Epithelium; md, Miillerian duct; mo, mesorchium; rc, rete-cords- sc, sex-cords; wd, Wolffian duct—(Mihalkovick) gave rise to them, so that they now extend between the sex-cord masses and the mesonephric glomeruli. The sex- cord masses eventually form the seminiferous tubules, while from the rete-cords are formed the tubuli recti and rete tes- tis, by which the spermatozoa are transmitted to the Wolf- fian duct (see p. 378). The development of the seminiferous tubules is not com- pleted, however, until puberty. The sex-cord masses elon-

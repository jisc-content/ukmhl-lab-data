114 YOLK-STALK AND FETAL MEMBRANES. I are known as the serosa, corresponding^ to the chorion of ^ Ithejmmmalian embryo. The space which occurs between the amnion and the serosa is^a^jjortion of the . extra- embryonic coelom and is continuous with the embryonic gleuroperitoneaLcayity:^ In the ovum of the chick, as in that of the reptile, the protoplasmic material is limited to one pole and rests upon the large yolk-mass. As development proceeds the germ layers gradually extend around the yolk-mass (compare Fig. 62, A-C) and eventually completely enclose it, the yolk- mass coming to lie within the endodermal layer, which, together with the splanchnic mesoderm which lines it, forms what is termed the yolk-sac. As the embryo separates from the yolk-mass the yolk-sac is constricted in its proximal por- tion and so differentiated into a yolk-stalk and a yolk-sac, the contents of the latter being gradually absorbed by the embryo during its growth, its walls and those of the stalk being converted into a portion of the embryonic digestive tract. In the meantime, however, from the posterior portion of the digestive tract, behind the point of attachment of the yolk-sac, a diverticulum has begun to form (Fig. 62, A). This increases in size, projecting into the extra-embryonic portion of the pleuroperitoneal cavity and pushing before it the splanchnic mesoderm which lines the endoderm (Fig. 62, B and C). This is the allantois, which, reaching a very considerable size in the chick and applying itself closely to the inside of the serosa, serves as a respiratory and excretory organ for the embryo, for which purpose its walls are richly supplied with blood-vessels, the allantoic arteries and veins. I Toward the end of the incubation period both the am- Â» 1 nion and allantois begin to undergo retrogressive changes, and just before the hatching of the young chick they become completely dried up and closely adherent to the egg-shell,

DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIMBS, 91 with the plantar surface of the foot, and the elbow with the knee. The limbs are, however, still in the quadrupedal condi- tion, and they must later undergo a second alteration in position so that their long axes again become parallel with that of the body. This is accomplished by a rotation of the limbs around axes passing through the shoulders and hip-joints together with a rotation about their longitudi- nal axes through an angle of 90 degrees. This axial rota- tion of the upper limb is, however, in exactly the opposite direction to that of the lower limb of the corresponding side, so that the homologous surfaces of the two limbs have entirely different relations, the radial side of the arm, for instance, being the outer side while the tibial side of the leg is the inner side, and whereas the palmar surface of the hand looks- ventrally, the plantar surface of the foot looks dorsally. In making these statements no account is taken of the secondary position which the hand may assume as the result of its pronation; the positions given are those assumed by the limbs when both the bones of their middle segment are parallel to one another. It may Jje pointed out that the prevalent use of the physio- logical terms flexor and extensor to describe the surfaces of the limbs has a tendency to obscure their true morphol'Sgical relationships. Thus if, as is usual, the dorsal surface of the arm be termed its extensor surface, then the same term should be applied to the entire ventral surface of the leg, and all move- ments of the lower limb ventrally should be spoken of as movements of extension and any movement dorsally as move- ments of flexion. And yet a ventral movement of the thigh is generally spoken of as a flexion of the hip-joint, while a straightening out of the foot upon the leg—that is to say, a movement of it dorsally—is termed its extension.

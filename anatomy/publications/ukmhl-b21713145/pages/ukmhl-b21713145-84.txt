70 DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. coelom, the embryo is but little advanced beyond the stage which the Peters' embryo had reached, and is probably in a late stage of the development of the primitive streak. Con- fining the attention for the present solely to the embryo and the immediately adjoining parts, it will be seen that the thickening of the chorionic mesoderm which encloses the amniotic cavity has increased in size and now forms a ped- icle, known:as the belly-stalk (b),at the extremity of which is the yolk-sac (3;). Furthermore, the amniotic cavity (a) Fig. 37.—Ovum Measuring 6 X 4.5 MM. The Left Half of THE Chorion has Been Re- moved TO show the Embryo. a, Amniotic cavity; b, belly-stalk; chorion; e, embryonic disk; V, chorionic villus; 31, yolk-sac. —(von Spec.)

The em- bryo still possesses a discoidal form and may still be de- scribed as a flat disk floating on the surface of the yolk-sac. This same general form is preserved in another embryo, known as embryo Gle, described by Graf Spee, which meas- ured i.j^4 mm. in length (Fig. 38). In it, however, the more median portion of the embryonic disk has become

THE FORMATION OF THE HEART, 244 ventrally and then downward and to the right, where it again bends at first dorsally and then anteriorj^ to pass over into the aortic bulb. The portion of the curve which hes dorsally and to the left is destiii^^p ^j^^^to both atria, the portion which passes from mght to le/t represents the future left ventricle, while the succeeding portion repre- sents the right ventricle. In la^er stages (Fig. 132) the left ventricular portion drops downward in front of the atrial portion^ assuming a more horizontal position, while the portion which represents the right ven- tricle is drawn forward so as to lie in the same plane as the left. At the same time two small out-pouchings de- velop from the atrial part of the heart and form the first indications of the two atria. As develop- ment progresses, these in- crease in size to form large pouches opening into a common atrial canal (Fig. 133) which is directly continuous with the left ventricle, and as the enlargement of the pouches continues their openings into the canal enlarge, until finally the pouches become continuous with one another, forming a gingle large sac, and the atrjal canal becomes reduced to a short tube which is slightly invaginated into the ventricle (Fig. 134)- In the meantime the sinus venosus, which was originally an oval sac and opened into the atrial canal, has elongated transversely until it has assumed the form of a crescent whose convexity is in contact with the walls of the atria, Fig. 133.—Heart of Embryo of 5 MM., Seen from in Front and SLIGHTLY from AbOVE.— (HtS.)

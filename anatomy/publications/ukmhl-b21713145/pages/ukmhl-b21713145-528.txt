POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. becoming transformed into hollow shells. These cavities, tog-ether with the sinuses of the sphenoid and frontal bones, which are also post-natal developments, seem to stand in relation to the increase in length of the anterior portion of the skull, serving to diminish the weight of the portion of the skull in front of the occipital condyles and so relieving the muscles of the neck of a considerable strain to which they would otherwise be subjected. These changes in the proportions of the skull have, of course, much to do with the changes in the general pro- FiG. 276.—Skull of a New-born Child and of an Adult Man, Drawn AS OF Approximately the Same Size.— (Hciikc.) portions of the face. But the changes which take place in the mandible are also important in this connection, and are similar to those of the maxillae in being associated with the development of the teeth. In the new-born child the horizontal ramus is proportionately shorter than in the adult, while the vertical ramus is very short and joins the horizontal one at an obtuse angle. The development of the teeth of the primary dentition, and later of the three molars, necessitates an elongation of the horizontal ramus equivalent to that occurring in the maxillae, and, at the same time, the separation of the alveolar borders of the two bones requires an elongation of the vertical ramus if the condyle

THE EYE. 48o week, a blood-vessel develops which traverses the cavity of the cup to reach the lens and is known as the arteria hyaloidea. In the meantime further changes have been taking place in the lens. The ectodermal depression which represents it gradually deepens to form a cup, the lips of which ap- proximate and finally meet, so that the cup is converted into a vesicle which finally separates completely from the ectoderm (Fig. 261), much in the same way as the otocyst does. As the lens vesicle is constricted off, the surround- ing mesodermal tissue grows in to form a layer between it and the overlying ectoderm, and a split appearing in the layer divides it into an outer thicker portion, which repre- sents the cornea, and an inner thinner portion, which covers the outer surface of the lens and becomes highly vascular. The cavity between these two portions represents the anterior chamber of the eye. The cavity of the optic cup has also become filled by a peculiar tissue which represents the vit- reous humor, while the mesodermal tissue surrounding the cup condenses to form a strong investment for it, which is externally continuous with the cornea, and at about the sixth week shows a differentiation into an inner vascular layer, the chorioid coat, and an outer denser one, which becomes the sclerotic coat. The various processes resulting in the formation of the eye, which have thus been rapidly sketched, may now be considered in greater detail. The Development of the Lens.â€”When the lens vesicle is complete, it forms a more or less spherical sac lying beneath the superficial ectoderm and containing in its cavity a few cells, either scattered or in groups (Fig. 261). These cells, which have wandered into the cavity of the vesicle from its walls, take no part in the further development of the lens, but early undergo complete degeneration, and the first change which is concerned with the actual formation of the lens is

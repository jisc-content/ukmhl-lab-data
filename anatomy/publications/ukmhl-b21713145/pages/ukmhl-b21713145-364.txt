THE PERITONEUM. 350 the mesentery be cut close to the Hue of its attachment, the course of the latter will be seen to be as follows: De- scending from the under surface of the diaphragm are the lines of attachment of the suspensory ligament, which on reaching the liver spread out to become the coronary and lateral ligaments of that organ. At about the mid-dorsal line these lines become continuous with those of the meso- gastrium which curve downward toward the left and are continued into the transverse lines of the transverse meso- colon. Between these last, in a slight prolongation, there may be seen to the right the cut end of the first portion of the duodenum as it passes back to the dorsal wall of the abdomen, and at about the mid-dorsal line the cut ends of its last part become visible as it passes ventrally again to become the jejunum. From the transverse mesocolon three lines of attachment pass downward; the two lateral broad ones represent the lines of fixation of the ascending and descending colons, while the narrower median one, which curves to the right, represents the attachment of the mesentery of the small intestine other than the duodenum. Finally, from the lower end of the fixation line of the descending colon, the mesentery of the sigmoid is continued downward. The special developments of the peritoneum in connec- tion with the genito-urinary apparatus will be considered in Chapter XIII. LITERATURE. I.

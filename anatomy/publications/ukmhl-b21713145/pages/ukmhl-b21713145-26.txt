THE SPERMATOZOON. g-enerally observed in the human spermatozoon, thouLrh several observers have claimed the existence of a spiral membrane and the head-cap undoubtedly exists in the earlier stages of the development of the spermatozoon, though it may later be lost Fig. 4.—Human Spermatozoon.

(After Rctzius.) To understand the significance of the various parts enter- ing into the composition of the spermatozoon a study of their development is necessary, and since the various proc- esses of spermatogenesis have been much more accurately observed in such mammalia as the rat and guinea-pig than in man, the description which follows will be based on what has been described as occurring in these forms. From what is known of the spermatogenesis in man it seems certain that it closely resembles that of these mammals so far as its essential features are concerned.

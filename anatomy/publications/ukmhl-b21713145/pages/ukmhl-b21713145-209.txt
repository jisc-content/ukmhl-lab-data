DEVELOPMENT OF APPENDICULAR SKELETON. 195 the trochlea and one for the capitulum, the fusion of these various epiphyses with the shaft taking place between the seventeenth and twentieth years. The radius and ulna each possess a single epiphysial center for each extremity in addi- tion to the primary center for the shaft, and the ulna pos- sesses also an epiphysial center for the olecranon process. The embryological development of the carpus is some- what complicated. A cartilage is found representing each of the bones normally occurring in the adult (Fig-Â«iio), and these are arranged in two distinct rows: a proximal one consisting of three elements, named from their relation to the bones of the fore- arm, radiale, interme- dium, and ulnare; and a distal one composed of four elements, termed carpalia. In addition, a cartilage, termed the pisiform, is found on the Fig ulnar side of the proxi- mal row and is generally regarded as a sesamoid cartilage developed in the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and furthermore a number of inconstant cartilages have been observed whose signifi- cance in the majority of cases is more or less obscure. These accessory cartilages either disappear in later stages of development or fuse with neighboring cartilages, or, in rare cases, ossify and form distinct elements of the carpus. One of them, however, occurs so frequently as almost to deserve classification as a constant element; it is known as 11 O.- Em- Reconstruction OF AN BRYoNic Carpus. c, Centrale; cu, triquetral; lu, lunate; m, capitate; p, pisiform; sc, navicular; t, greater multangular; tr, lesser mul- tangular; XI, hamate.

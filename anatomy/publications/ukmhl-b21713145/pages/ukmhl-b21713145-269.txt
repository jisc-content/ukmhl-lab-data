DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. villi, forming the allantoidean or umbilical arteries, while anteriorly each aorta sends 'branches ventrally in tjieanterior branchiararches, and these^jmitingJiige^ along theJoor_of the pharynx to become conjinuouswiththe aorticT)ulb_(Fig. 140).

Altogether, six of these vessels are de- veloped, the fifth being rudimentary and transi- tory, and when fully formed they have an ar- rangement which may be understood from the diagram (Fig. 141). This arrangement represents a condi- tion which is permanent in the lower vertebrates. In the fishes the respiration is performed by means of gills devel- oped upon^ tjieJ)ranchial arches, and the heart is an organ which receives venous blood from the body and pumps it^to the gills, in which it becomes arterialized and is then collected into the dorsal aortas, which distribute it to the body.

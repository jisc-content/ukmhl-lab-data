3 INTRODUCTION. division of labor. Indeed, the comparison of the cell- community to the social community may be carried still further, for just as gradations of individuality may be rec- ognized in the individual, the municipality, the state, and the republic, so too in the cell-community there are cells; tissues, each of which is an aggregate of similar cells; organs, which are aggregates of tissues, one, however, predominating and determining the character of the organ; and systems, which are aggregates of organs having correlated functions. '* It is the province of embry- ' ology to study the mode of di- \ vision of the fertilized ovum 1 and the progressive differenti- I ation of the resulting cells to I form the tissues, organs, and systems. But before consider- ^ng these phenomena as seen in the human body it will be well to get some general idea of the structure of an animal cell. This (Fig. i), as has been already stated, is a mass of protoplasm, a substance which in the living condition is a viscous fluid resembling in many of its peculiarities egg- albumen, and like this being coagulated when heated or when exposed to the action of various chemical reagents. As to the structure of living protoplasm little is yet known, since the application of the reagents necessary for its accu- rate study and analysis results in its disintegration or coagu- lation. But even in the living cell it can be seen that the protoplasm is not a simple homogeneous substance. What is termed a nucleus is usually clearly discernible as a more or less spherical body q£a greater refractive index than the surrounding protoplasm, and since this is a permanent organ of the cell it is convenient to distinguish the surrounding Fig. I.—Ovum of New-born Child with Follicle- cells.—(Mertens.)

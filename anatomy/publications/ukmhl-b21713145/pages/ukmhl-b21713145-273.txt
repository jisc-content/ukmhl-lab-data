DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 259 be the continuations of the aorta rather than branches of. it, The"true continuation of the aorta is, however, the middle sacral artery," which represents in. a degenerated form the caudal prolongation of the aorta of other mam- mals, and, like this, gives off lateral branches corresponding to the sacral segments. In addition to the seg- mental lateral branches arising from the aorta, visceral branches, which have their origin rather from the ventral sur- face, also occur. In em- bryos of 5 mm. these branches are arranged in a segmental manner, a median unpaired vessel ICo, JM nac;ci-no- to the rhp-p^tive ^^^^ I44-â€”Diagram showing the Re- passmg to tne aigestive lations of the Lateral Branches tract and a pair of more to the Aortic Arches.

As development proceeds the great majority of these visceral branches disappear, certain of the lateral ones persisting, however, to form the renal, internal sper- matic, and hypogastric arteries of the adult, while the unpaired_ branches are represented only by the coeliac artery and the superior and inferior mesenteries. The superior mesenteric artery is the adult representative of

CHAPTER XII. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. The Development of the Lungs.—Thelirst indication of the lungs and trachea is found in embryos of about 32 mm. in the form of a groove on the ventral surface of the oesophagus, at first extending almost the entire length of that portion of the digestive tract. As the oesophagus lengthens the lung groove remains connected with its upper portion (Fig. 175, A), and furrows which appear along the line of junction of the groove and the oeso- phagus gradually deepen and separate the two struc- tures (Fig. 175, B). The separation takes place earli- est at the lower end of the groove and thence extends upward, so that the groove Fig. 195.—Portion of a Section transformed intoTcvHrT- THROUGH AN EmBRYO OF THE IS iranSIOUHeU lllLU d^^XLiiL Fourth Week. drical pouch lying ventral A, Aorta; DC, ductus Cuvieri; L tolhe"oesophagu^^ lung; O, oesophagus; RP, parietal ^aj__uic_^^;0^^j_ 1, recess; VOm, omphalo-mesenteric gal tO the heart and Open- xtm.-Croldt.) .^^^ ^^j^l^ ^j^g oesophagus into the terminal portion of the pharynx.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. 271 At first this sinus drains by way of the anterior cerebral vein (F^g. 151, but as the cerebral hemispheres increase irfsize it is gradually carried backward and makes connec- tions first with the middle cerebral and later with the pos- terior cerebral vein (Fig. 151, B and C), each of these becoming in turn the principal drainage of the sinus.

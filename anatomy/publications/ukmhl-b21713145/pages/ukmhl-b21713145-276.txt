DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. these secondary longitudinal trunks is the result of a devel- opment between adjacent vesseir^l anastomoses,' which become larger and more important blood-channels than the original vessels^ At an__early stage each of the lateral branches of the dorsal aorta gives off a twig which passes forward to anas- tomose with a backwardly directed twig from the next anterior lateral branch, so as to form a longitudinal chain of anastomoses along each~side of the neck. In the earliest stage at present known thej:hain^ starts from the lateral branch corresponding to the first cervical (suboccipital) seg- ment and extends forward into the skull through the fora- men magnum, terminatingby anastomosing with the internal carotid. To this original chain other links are added from each of the succeeding cervical lateral branches as far back as the seventh (Figs. 146 an3~T44). But in the meantime the recession of the heart toward the thorax has begun, with the result that the common carotid stems are elongated and the aortic_arches are apparently shortened so that the sub- clavian arises on the left side almost opposite. the_.point where the aorta was joined by the sixth branchial vessel As this apparent shortening proceeds, the various lateral branches which give rise to the chain of anastomoses,_with the exception of the seventh, disappear in their proximal portions and the chain becomes an independent stem, the vertebral artery, arjsing from the seventh lateral branch, which is the subclavian. The recession of the heart is continued until it lies below the level of the upper intercostal arteries, and tjie upper two of these, together with the last cervical branch on each side, lose their connection with the dorsal aorta, and, send- ing off anteriorly and posteriorly anastomosing twigs, de- velop a short longitudinal stem, the superior intercostal, which opens into, the subclavian.

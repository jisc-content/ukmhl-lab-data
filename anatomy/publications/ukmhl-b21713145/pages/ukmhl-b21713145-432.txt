THE CEREBELLUM. 4i8 in the roof-plate of the metencephalon and along the line of junction of the cerebellar thickening with the roof-plate continuing to divide. The indifferent cells formed in these regions migrate_putward from the median line and forward in the marginal velum to form a superficial layer, known as the epithdioid layer, and cover the entire surface of the cerebellum. The cells of this layer, like those of the man- tle, differentiate into neuroglia cells and neuroblasts, the latter for the most part ^^^^ Tvr. Fig. 230.—Diagram Representing the Differentiation of the Cerebellar Cells. The circles, indifferent cells; circles with dots, neuroglia cells; shaded cells, ger- minal cells; circles with cross, ger- minal cells in mitosis; black cells, nerve-cells.

The neuroglia cells re- main at the surface, however, forming the princfpal constituent of the outer or, as it is now termed, the ino- Icciilcir layer oT tlitr into this cortex, the dendrites of Purkinje cells, prob- ably derived from the mantle layer, project. The migra- fion of the neuroblasts of the epithelial layer is probably completed before birth, at which time but few remain in the molecular laver to form the stellate cells of the adult^ The ong2n_oLthedenta^^ nuclei of the cerebellum is at present unknown, but it seems probable thaLthey_arise_ from^cefls of the mantle layer."

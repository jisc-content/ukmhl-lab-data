DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOUTH REGION. 299 lower end of the rectum as corresponds to this muscle is formed by the inner surface of the elevation and is there- fore ectodermal. The definitive anus being at the end of this terminal portion of the gut is therefore some distance away from the position of the original cloacal membrane. It will be noticed that the digestive tract thus formed consists of three distinct portions, an anterior, short, ecto- dermal portion, an endodermal portion representing the original archenteron, and a posterior short portion which is also ectodermal. The differentiation of the tract into its various regions and the formation of the various organs found in relation with these may now be considered. The Development of the Mouth Region.â€”The deep- ening of the oral sinus by the development of the first bran- chial arch and its separation into the oral and nasal cavities by the development of the palate have already been described (p. 88), but, for the sake of continuity in description, the latter process may be briefly recalled. At first the nasal pits communicate with the oral sinus by grooves lying one on each side of the fronto-nasal process, but by the union of the latter with the maxillary process this communication is interrupted and the pits make new connections with the oral sinus behind the maxillary process. At about the fifth week_a downgrowth of epithelium into the substance of both the maxillarj^and fronto-nasal processes above and the mandibular process below, takes place and the surface of the downgrowth becomes marked by a deepening groove (Fig. 164), which separates an anterior fold, the lip, from the jaw proper (Fig. 165). From the maxillo-palatine portions of the upper jaw, shelf-like ridges then begin to grow at first downwards and then medially, and at about the beginning of the third month these meet in the median line to form the palateTandlTmre anteriorly with the pre-

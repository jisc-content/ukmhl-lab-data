DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPRARENAL BODIES. 393 the mesentery and the tipper portion of the Wolffian bodv^ The various prohferations soon separate from the epithe^, liiim and unite to form two m.asses situated in the mesen- chyme one ondther side of the upper portion of the abdom- irraT"aorta. In certain forms, such as the rabbit, the pri- niary prohferations arise from the bottom of depressions of the coelomic epithehum (Fig. 216), but in the human embryo these depressions do not form. Up to this stage the structure is a pure interrenal organ, but during^ the fifth week of development Qiasses of cells, derived from the abdominal_gortion of the sympathetic^ s 0 »o ,>Sr»i- »'f\'\ Si Fig. 216.—Section through a Portion of the Wolffian Ridge of A Rabbit Embryo of 6.5 mm.

At about the ninth or tenth week fatty granules begin to appear in the interrenal cells and somewhat later, about the fourth month, the sympathetic constituents begin to show their c.hromaffine characteristics. The two tissues, how- ever, remain intermingled for a considerable time, and it is not until a much later period that they become definitely separated, the svmpathetic elements gradually concentrat- ing in_the centre of the compound organ to become its medullary substance, while the interrenal tissue forms the cortical substance. Indeed, it is not until after birth that

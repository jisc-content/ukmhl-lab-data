420 THE MESENCEPHALON. The Development of the Mesencephalon.â€”Our knowl- edge of the development of this portion of the brain is again very imperfect. During- the stages when the flexures of the brain are well marked (Figs. 225 and 226) it forms a very prominent structure and possesses for a time a capa- cious cavity. Later, however, it increases in size less rap- idly than adjacent parts and its walls thicken, the roof- and floor-plates as well as the zones, and, as a result, the cavity becomes the relatively smaller canal-like cerebral aqujeduct. In the marginal velum of its ventral zone fibers appear at about the third month, forming the anterior portion of the cerebral peduncles, and, at the same time, a median longi- tudinal furrow appears upon the dorsal surface, dividing it into two lateral elevations which, in the fifth month, are divided transversely by a second furrow and are thus con- verted from corpora bigemina (in which form they are found in the lower vertebrates) into corpora qundrigemhia. Nothing is known as to the differentiation of the gray mat- ter of the dorsal and ventral zones of the mid-brain. From the relation of the parts in the adult it seems probable that in addition to the nuclei of origin of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, the ventral zones give origin to the gray matter of the tegmentum, which is the forward continuation of the reticular formation. Similarly it may be supposed that the corpora quadrigemina are developments of the dorsal zones, as may also be the red nuclei, whose relations to the brachia conjunc- tiva suggest a comparison with the olivary bodies and the nuclei of the pons. A tentative scheme representing the origin of the mid-brain structures may be stated thus: Roof-plate, (?) f Corpora quadrigemina. Dorsal zones, [^^^^ Ventral zones, < Nuclei of origin of the third and fourth nerves. Anterior part of tegmentum. Anterior part of cerebral peduncles. Floor-plate, Median raphe.

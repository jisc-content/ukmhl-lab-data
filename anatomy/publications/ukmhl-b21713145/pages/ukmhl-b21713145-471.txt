THE OLFACTORY ORGAN. 457 peculiarities which distinguish them from those of all other sense-organs. Emhryologically the retina is a portion of the central nervous system and not a peripheral organ, and hence it will be convenient to arrange the other sense-organs according to the classification indicated and to discuss the history of the eye at the close of the chapter. The Development of the Olfactory Organ.—The gen- eral development of the nasal fossa, the epithelium of which contains the olfactory sense cells', has already been described (pp. 8i and 89), as has also the development of the olfac- tory lobes of the brain (p. 433), and there remains for con- sideration here merely the formation of the olfactory nerve and the development of the rudimentary organ of Jacobson. The Olfactory Nerve.—Very diverse results have been obtained by various observers of the development of the olfactory nerve, it having been held at different times that it was formed by the outgrowth of fibers from the olfac- tory lobes (Marshall), from fibers which arise partly from the olfactory lobes and partly from the olfactory epithelium (Beard), from the cells of an olfactory ganglion originally derived from the olfactory epithelium but later separating from it (His), and, finally, that it was composed of the pro- longations of certain cells situated and, for the most part at least, remaining permanently in the olfactory epithelium (Disse). The most recent observations on the structure of the olfactory epithelium and nerve indicate a greater amount of probability in the last result than in the others, and the description which follows will be based upon the observa- tions of His, modified in conformity with the results ob- tained by Disse from chick embryos. In human embryos of the fourth week the cells lining the upper part of the olfactory pits show a distinction into ordinary epithelial and sensory cells, the latter, when fully formed, being elongated cells prolonged peripherally into a 40

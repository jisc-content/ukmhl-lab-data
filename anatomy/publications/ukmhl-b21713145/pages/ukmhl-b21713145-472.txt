THE OLFACTORY ORGAN. 458 short but narrow process which reaches the surface of the epithehum and proximally gives rise to an axis-cyhnder process which extends up toward and penetrates the tip of the olfactory lobe to come into contact with the dendrites of the first central neurones of the olfactory tract (Fig. Fig. 245.—Diagram Illustrating the Relations of the Fibers of THE Olfactory Nerve. Ep, Epithelium of the olfactory pit; C, cribiform plate of the ethmoid, G, glomerulus of the olfactory bulb; M, mitral cell.— {Van Ge- huchten.) 245). These cells constitute a neuro-epithelium and in later stages of development retain their epithelial position for the most part, a few of them, however, withdrawing into the subjacent mese^iichyme and becoming bipolar, their periph-

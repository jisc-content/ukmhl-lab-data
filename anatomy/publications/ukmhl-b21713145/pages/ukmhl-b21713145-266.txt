252 THE FORMATION OF THE HEART. Fig. 139.—Diagrams II lustrating the for MATION OF THE SeMI LUNAR Valves.— (Ge genbaur.) ditim, but when the condensation of the muscje trabecnlce ^^'^^ endocardium apphes itself closely to the irregu- lar surface so formed, dipping into all the crevices between the trabeculse carnese and wrapping itself around the mus- culi papillares and chordae tendineae so as to form a com- plete lining of the inner surface of the myocardium. The aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves make their appearance, before the aortic bulb undergoes its longitudinal split- ting, as four tubercle-like thicken- ings of connective tissue situated on the inner wall of the bulb just where it arises from the ventricle. When the division of the bulb occurs, two of the thickenings, situated on opposite sides, are divided, so that both the pulmonary and systemic aortse receive three thickenings (Fig. 139). Later the thickening becomes hollowed out on the surfaces directed away from the ventricles and are so converted into the pouch-like valves of the adult. Changes in the Heart after Birth.—The heart wjien first formed lies far^forward in the neck region of the embryo, betweeii_the head and the anterior surface of the yolk-sac, and from this position it gradually recedes until it reaches its fina] position in the thorax. And not only does it thus change its relative position, but the direction of its axes also changes. For at an early stage the ventricles lie directly in front of (i- ^-j ventrad to) the^atria and not below them as in the adult heart, and this primitive condition is retained until the diaphragm has reached its final position (see p. 342). In addition to these changes in position, important changes also occur in the atrial septum after birth^

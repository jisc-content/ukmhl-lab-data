36 SUPERFETATION. moment of the latter process can only be approximated, and in the immense majority of cases it is necessary to rely upon the date of the last menstruation for an estima- tion of the probable date of parturition. And by this method the possibilities for error are much greater. It has been seen that ovulation usually, though not invariably, is associated with menstruation, but it is uncertain whether the ovum whose fertilization has resulted in a pregnancy was expelled from its follicle during the last menstrual period which occurred, or during or just preceding the first omitted period. Both views have been advocated, but it seems probable that the latter case is the more frequent, the fertilized ovum being one which has been expelled from its follicle subsequent to the last menstruation which oc- curred. The duration of pregnancy is normally ten lunar or about nine calendar months and it is customary to esti- mate the probable date of parturition as nine months and seven days from the last menstruation. From what has been said, it is clear that any such estimation can be de- pended upon only as an approximation, the possible varia- tion from it being considerable. Superfetation.â€”The occasional occurrence of twin fetuses in different stages of development has suggested the possi- bility of the fertilization of a second ovum as the result of a coition at an appreciable interval of time after the first ovum has started upon its development. There seems to be good reason for believing that many of the cases of supposed siiper- fetaiion, as this phenomenon is termed, are instances of the simultaneous fertilization of two ova, one of which, for some cause concerned with the supply of nutrition, has later failed to develop as rapidly as the other. At the same time, how- ever, even although the phenomenon may be of rare occurrence, it is by no means impossible, for occasionally a second Graafian follicle, either in the same or the other ovary, may be so near maturity that its ovum is extruded soon after the first one, and if the development of the latter and the incidental changes in the uterine mucous membrane have not proceeded so far as to prevent the access of the spermatozoon to the ovum,

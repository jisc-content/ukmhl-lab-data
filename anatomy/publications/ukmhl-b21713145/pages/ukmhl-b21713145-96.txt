82 DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. hence is known as the maxillary process, while the lower hmb represents the lower jaw and is termed the mandibular process. Leaving aside for the present all consideration of the further development of the limbs and branchial arches, the further evolution of the general form of the body may be rapidly sketched. In an embryo (Fig. 47) from Ruge's collection, described and figured by His and measuring Fig. 48.—Embryo Br,, 13.6 mm. Long.—(i7w.) 9j_nTm. in length,* the prolongation of the margins of the umbilicus has increased until more than half the yolk-stalk has become enclosed within the umbilical cord. The neck and sacral bends are still very pronounced, although the embryo is beginning to straighten out and is not quite so much coiled as in the preceding stage. At the posterior * This measurement is taken in a straight line from the most anterior portion of the neck bend to the middle point of the sacral bend and does not follow the curvature of the embryo. It may be spoken of as the neck-rump length and is convenient for use during the stages when the embryo is coiled upon itself.

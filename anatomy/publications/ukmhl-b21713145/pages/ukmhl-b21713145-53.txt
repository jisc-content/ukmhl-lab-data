39 CHAPTER 11. THE SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM AND THE FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. Segmentation.â€”The union of the male and female pro- nuclei has already been described as being accompanied by the formation of a mitotic spindle which produces a division of the ovum into two cells. This first division is succeeded at more or less regular intervals by others until a mass of cells is produced in which a differentiation eventually ap- pears. These divisions of the ovum constitute what is termed its segmmtation. The mammalian ovum has behind it a long line of evolu- tion, and even at early stages in its development it exhibits peculiarities which can only be reasonably explained as'' an inheritance of past conditions.'' One of the most potent factors in modifying the character of the segmentation of the ovum is the amount of food yolk which it contains, and it seems to be certain that the immediate ancestors of the mammalia were forms whose ova contained a considerable amount of yolk, many of the peculiarities resulting from its presence being still clearly indicated in the early develop- ment of the almost yolkless mammalian ovum. To give some idea of the peculiarities which result from the presence of considerable amounts of yolk it will be well to compare the processes of segmentation and differentiation seen in ova with different amounts of it. A little below the scale of the vertebrates proper is a form, Amphioxus, which possesses an almost yolkless ovum, presenting a simple process of development. The fertilized

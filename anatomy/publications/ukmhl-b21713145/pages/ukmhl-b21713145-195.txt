OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. l8l bones developing fromJhg^cartilag^s_oli^^ arclies. The bones "belonging to each of these categories are pri- marily quite distinct from one another and from those of the other groups, but in the human skull a very considerable amount of fusion of the primary bones takes place, and ele- ments belonging to two or even to all three categories may unite to form a single bone of the adult skull. In a certain region of the chondrocranium also and in one of the bran- chial arches the original cartilage bone becomes ensheathed by membrane bone and eventually disappears completely, so that the adult bone, although represented by a car- tilage, is really a mem- brane bone. And, in- deed, this process has proceeded so far in certain portions of the branchial arch skeleton that the original cartilag- inous representatives are no longer developed, but the bones are deposited directly in connective tissue. These various modifications interfere greatly with the precise application to the human skull of the classification of bones into the three categories given above, and indeed the true significance of certain of the skull bones can only be perceived by comparative studies. Nevertheless it seems advisable to retain the classification, indicating, where necessary, the confusion of bones of the various categories.

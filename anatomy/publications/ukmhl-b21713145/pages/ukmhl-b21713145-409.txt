DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPRARENAL BODIES. 395 tions of their tissue may be separated as the result of un- equal growth and form what are commonly spoken of as accessory suprarenal glands, although, since they are usu- alh^ composed solelv"or"cortical substance, the term acces- sory interrenal bodies would be more appropriate. They may be formed at different periods of development and occur in various situations, as for instance, in the vicinity of the kidneys or even actually imbedded in their substance, on the walls of neighboring blood-vessels, in the retroperi- toneal tissue below the level of the kidneys, and in connec- tion with the organs of_reproduction, in tl2e_sperniatic cord, epididymis or rete testis of the male and jn the broad liga- ment of the female. It seems probable that the bodies associated with the reproductive apparatus are separated from the main mass of interrenal tissue before the immigration of the sympa- thetic tissue and before the descent of the ovaries or testes, while those which occur at higher levels are of later origin, and in some cases may contain some medullary substance, being then true accessory suprarenals. Such bodies are, however, comparatively rare, the great majority of the accessory bodies being composed of interrenal tissue alone. Independent chromaffine organs also occur, among them the intercaroticl_g;anglia and the organs of Zuckerkandl being especially deserving of note. It may also be pointed out, however, that the chromaffine cells have the same origin as the cells of the sympathetic ganglia and may sometimes fail to separate from the latter, so that the sympathetic ganglia and plexuses frequently contain chromaffine cells. The Intercarotid Ganglia.â€”These structures, which are frequently though incorrectly termed carotid glands, are small bodies about 5 mm. in length, which lie usually to the mesial side of the upper ends of the common carotid arteries. They possess a very rich arterial supply and

26 CORPUS LUtEUM. trabecnlje are formed entirely from the cells of the theca interna, which increase rapidly both in size and number. The other view was first advanced by Bischojfif and may be known by his name. It is to the effect that the granulosa cells do not disintegrate, but, on the contrary, increase rap- idly in number and become converted into the lutein cells, only the connective tissue and the blood-vessels being derived from the theca interna. Which of these two views is correct is at present uncer- tain. The majority of those who have within recent years studied the formation of the human corpus luteum have expressed themselves in favor of von Baer's theory. So- botta has, however, made-a thorough study of the phenom- ena in a perfect series of mice ovaries and has demonstrated that in that form the lutein cells are derived from the granu- losa cells. It would be strange if the lutein cells had a different origin in two different mammals, and the observa- tions on mice are so thorough that one is tempted to regard different results as being due to imperfections in the series of ovaries studied, important steps in the development of the corpora lutea being thus overlooked. This temptation is, moreover, greatly increased by the fact that Sobotta's observations have been confirmed in the cases of several other animals, such, for instance, as the rabbit (Sobotta, Honore, Cohn), certain bats (van der Stricht), the sheep (Marshall), the marsupial dasyurus (Sandes), the spermo- phile (Volker), and the guinea-pig (Sobotta). The weight of evidence is at the present time strongly in favor of Bischoff's view, but until the adverse results obtained by Clarke and oUiers from the study of the human corpus luteum and those obtained by Jankowski from the pig have been shown to be incorrect, the question as to the invariable derivation of the luteum cells from the stratum granulosum [ must be left open. Since it is held that both the granulosa

DEVELOPMENT OF APPENDICULAR SKELETON. 193 well as some of the other elements of the skull, and a resume of the fate of the branchial arches may be stated in tabular form as follows, the parts represented by cartilage which becomes replaced by membrane bone being- printed in italics, while membrane bones which have no cartilaginous representatives are enclosed in brackets: Tst arch, 2(1 arch, (Maxilla). (Palatine). Malleus. Incus. Spheno-mandibular ligament. Mandible. Styloid process of the temporal. Stylo-hyoid ligament. Lesser cornu of hyoid. 3d arch, Greater cornu of hyoid. 4th and 5th arches, Thyreoid cartilage of larynx. The Development of the Appendicular Skeleton.— While the greater portion of the axial skeleton is formed from the sclerotomes of the mesodermic somites, the ap- pendicular skeleton is derivecL.from the somatic mesen- chyme, which is not divided intn metnmeres. This mes^n^ chyme forms the core of th.e.iimb.-bud-and iDeconies con- verted into cartilage,_by the ossification of which all the bones of the limbs, wnth the possible exception of the clavi- cle, are formed. Of the bones of. the pectoral girdle the clavicle requires further study before it can be certain whether it is to be regarded as a purely cartilage bone or as a combination of cartilage and membrane ossifications (Gegenbaur). It is the first bone of the skeleton to ossify, tjyo centers api:>€ar- ing for each l)one at about the^sixth week of development. The ti ssue in which the ossifications form has certaui pecu- liar characters, and it is difficult to say whether it is to be 18

158 DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAMMARY GLANDS. area and frec[uently op^enin^^ lacteal ducts. In the areola, as the area surrounding the nipple is termed, other glands known as Montgomery's glands, also appear, their development resembling that of the mammary^gland so closely as to render it probable that they are really''rudimentary mammary glands'! The further development of the glands, consisting of an increase in the length of the ducts and the development from them of additional acini, continues slowly up to the time of puberty in both sexes, but at that period further growth Fig. 87.—Section through the Mammary Gland of an Embryo of 25 CM. I, Stroma of the gland.—{From Nagel, after Basch.) ceases in the male, while in females it continues for a time and the subjacent dermal tissues, especially the adipose tis- sue, undergo a rapid development. The occurrence of a milk ridge has not yet been observed in a sufficient number of embryos to determine whether it is a normal development or is associated with the formation of supernumerary glands {polymastia). This is by no means an infrequent anomaly; it. has been observed in 19 per cent, of over 100,000 soldiers of the German army who were examined, and occurs in 47 per cent, of individuals in certain regions of Germany. The extent to which the anomaly is developed varies from the occurrence of well-developed accessory glands to that of rudimentary accessory nipples (hyperthclia), these latter sometimes occurring in the areolar area of a normal gland and being possibly due in such cases to an h)^pertrophy of one or more of Montgomery's glands. <

THE GENITAL RIDGE. cells grow down into the subjacent tissue of the ridge, this process not taking place, however, to an equal extent in all portions of the ridge. Indeed, three regions may be recog- nized in the ridge; an anterior one, in which a relatively small number of cell-columns, extending deeply into the stroma, are formed; a middle one in which numerous col- umns are formed; and a posterior one in which practically none are formed. The first region has been termed the rete region and its cell-columns the rete-cords, the second region the sex-gland region and its columns the sex-cords, and the posterior region is the mesenteric region and plays no part in the actual formation of the ovary or testis. The histological differentiation of the genital ridge de- scribed above is common to both sexes and, in the human embryo, is completed at about the fourth or fifth week. After that period the development differs somewhat accord- ing as the sex-gland is to become a testis or an ovary, and consequently the further development of these two struc- tures may be described separately. Before doing so, how- ever, the development of certain accessory structures may be briefly described. At first the ridge is of insignificant dimensions compared with the more voluminous Wolffian body (Fig. 200), but as the degeneration of the latter proceeds the relative size of the two structures becomes reversed and the genital ridge forms a marked prominence attached to the surface of the Wolffian ridge by a fold of peritoneum which becomes the mesovarium in the female and the mesqrchium in the male. The fold which surrounds the Wolffian body becomes trans- formed on the degeneration of that structure into the broad ligament, the transverse position of which in the adult is due toTiieTfusion of the lower portions of the Miillerian ducts,, and since the genital ridges lie primarily to the median side of the ducts, they come to be attached by their mesentery

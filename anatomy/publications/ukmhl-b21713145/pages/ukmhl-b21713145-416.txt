402 THE HISTOGENESIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. cylinder. At a later period the neuroblasts also give rise to other processes, termed deiuiritcs, more slender and shorter than the axis-cylinders, branching repeatedly and, as a rule, not extending beyond the limits of the mantle layer. The axis-cylinder processes of the majority of the neuro- blasts on reaching the marginal velum bend upward or downward and, after traversing a greater or- less length of the cord, re-enter the mantle layer and terminate by A B Fig. 221—Diagrams showing the Development of the Mantle Layer in the Spinal Cord. The circles, indifferent cells; circles with dots, neuroglia cells; shaded cells, germinal cells; circles with cross, germmal cells m mitosis; black cells, nerve-cells.—(6'c//a/'^r.) dividing into numerous short branches which come into relation with the dendrites of adjacent neuroblasts. Tlie processes of certain cells situated in the ventral region of the mantle zone pass, however, directly through the mar- ginal velum out into the surrounding tissues and constitute t\vt ventral nerve-roots (Fig. 224). The dorsal nerve-roots have a very different origm. In embryos of about 2.5 mm., in which the medullary canal

50 FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. the Opening by which this communicates with the exterior is the blastopore. This last structure is at first a very- wide opening, but as development proceeds it becomes smaller, and finally is a relatively small opening situated at the posterior extremity of what will be the dorsal surface of the embryo. As the oval embryo continues to elongate in its later development the third layer or mesoderm makes its appear- ance. It arises as a lateral fold [pip) of the dorsal surface of the endoderm (en) on each side of the middle line as indi- FiG. 22.—Two Stages in the Gastrulation of Amphioxus—{Morgan and Hazen.) cated in the transverse section shown in Fig. 23. This fold eventually become_s completely constricted pf¥ Jromlhe en- doderm and forms a hollow plate occupying the space between the ectoderm and endoderm, the cavity which it contains being the body-cavity or c^lom. " in the amphibia, where the amount of yolk is very much greater than in Amphioxus, the gastrulation becomes con- siderably modified. On the line where the large- and small- celled portions of the blastula become continuous a crescentic groove appears and, deepening, forms an invagination (Fig.

l62 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. membrane bone or cartilaf;_e bone. In the development of membrane bone some of the connective-tissue ^lls^_which in consequence become known as osteoblasts, deposit hme salts in the matrix in the form o_f bony spicules which in- crease in size and soonjmite to form a network (Fig. 88). The trabeculse of the network continue to thicken, while, at the same time, the forma- tion of spicules extends further out into the con- nective-tissue membrane, radiating in all directions from the region in which it first developed.

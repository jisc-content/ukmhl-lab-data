375 THE OVARY. (see p. 13) and being the mother cells of the spermatozoa, while the remaining epithelial cells perhaps become trans- formed into Sertoli cells (Benda). The Development of the Ovary.â€”In the case of the ovary, after the formation of the sex-cords, connective tissue grows in between these and the epithelium, forming a layer equiva- lent to the tunica albugiriea of the testis. It is, however, a much looser tissue than its homologue in the male, and, indeed, does not completely isolate the sex-cords from the epithelium, although the majority of the cords are separated and sink into the deeper portions of the ovary where they form what have been termed the mediillary cords. In the meantime the germinal epithelium has continued to bud of? cords which unite to form a cortical layer of cells lying below the epithelium and separated from the medullary cords by the tunica albuginea (Fig. 209). Later the cortical layer becomes broken up by the in- growth of stroma tissue into spherical or cord-like masses, consisting of sex-cells and epithelial cells (Fig. 210). The invasion of the stroma continuing, these spheres or cords (Pfliiger's cords) become divided into smaller masses, the primary ovarian follicles, each of which consists as a rule of a single sex-cell surrounded by a number of epithelial cells, the whole being enclosed by a zone of condensed stroma tissue, which eventually becomes richly vascularized and forms a theca folliculi (Fig. 9). The epithelial cells in each follicle are at first comparatively few in number and closely surround the sex-cell (Fig. 210, /), which is destined to become an ovum, but in certain of the follicles they un- dergo an increase by mitosis, becoming extremely numerous, and later secrete a fluid, the liquor folliculi, which collects at one side of the follicle and eventually forms a consider- able portion of its contents. The follicular cells are differ- entiated by its appearance into the stratum ^ranulosum,_

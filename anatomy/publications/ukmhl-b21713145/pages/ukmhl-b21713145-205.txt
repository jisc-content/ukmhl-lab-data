OSSIFICATION OF BRANCHIAL ARCH SKELETON. IQI and the coronoid process. In the region of the body the bone develops so as to enclose the cartilage, together with the inferior alveolar (dental) nerve which lies to the outer side of the cartilage, but in the region of the ramus the bone remains entirely to the outer side of the cartilage and nerve, whence the position of the mandibular foramen on the inner surface of the adult bone. The portion of Meck- el's cartilage extending from the symphysis to the level of the mental foramen ossifies to form the mental portion of the mandible, but throughout the rest of the body of the bone it disappears, while the portion above the mandibular foramen is said to become transformed into fibrous connec- tive tissue and to persist as the spheno-mandibular ligament. At the upper extremity of the bony ramus two nodules of cartilage develop, quite independently, however, of Meck- el's cartilage, and these ossify to form the condyloid and coronoid processes, so that each half of the mandible is formed of membrane bone, with cartilage bone at each extremity. The upper part of the cartilage of the second branchial arch also comes into relation with the tympanic cavity and ossifies to form the styloid process of the temporal bone. The succeeding moiety of the cartilage undergoes degeneration to form the stylo-hyoid ligament, while its most ventral portion ossifies as the lesser cornu of the hyoid hone. The great variability which may be observed in the length of the styloid processes and of the lesser cornua of the hyoid depends upon the extent to which the ossification of the original cartilage proceeds, the length of the stylo-hyoid ligaments being in inverse ratio to the length of the processes or cornua. The greater cornua of the hyoid are formed by the ossification of the cartilages of the third arch, and the body of the bone is formed from a cartilaginous plate, the copula, which unites the ventral ends of the two arches concerned.

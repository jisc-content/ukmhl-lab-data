THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. Standing in relation to the white rami. At first there is no indication of a segmental arrangement of the cells of the column (Fig. 244), but at about the seventh week such an arrangement makes its appearance in the cervical region, and later, extends posteriorly, until the column assumes the form of the ganglionated cord. Before, however, the segmentation becomes marked, thickenings appear at certain regions of the cell column, and from these, bundles of fibers may be seen extending ventrally toward the viscera. The thickenings represent certain of the praevertebral ganglia, and later cells wander out from them and take a position in front of the aorta. In an embryo of 10.2 mm. two ganglionic masses (Fig. 244, pc) occur in the vicinity of the origin of the omphalo- mesenteric artery {am), one lying above and the other below that vessel; these masses represent the ganglia of the cceliac plexus and have separated somewhat from the ganglionated cord, the fiber bundles which unite the upper mass with the cord representing the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves {sp), while that connected with the lower mass represents the connection of the cord with the superior mesenteric ganglion. Lower down, in the neighborhood of the umbilical arteries, is another enlargement of the cord {bg), which probably represents the inferior mesenteric and hypogastric ganglia which have not yet separated from the cell column. In the cervical region a similar origin of the ganglion cells of the cardiac plexus from the cell column seems to obtain. In embryos of about 7 mm. fibers may be seen extending from the column toward the heart, and, entering into close relationship with descending branches from the vagus, they form a plexus, the ganglia of which are com- posed of cells which have wandered from the cell column.

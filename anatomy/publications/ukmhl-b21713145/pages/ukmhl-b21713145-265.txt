THE FORMATION OF THE HEART. 251 surfaces of these flaps the loosely arranged muscular tra- beculje of the ventricle are attached, and muscular tissue also occurs in the flaps. This condition is transitory, how- ever ; the muscular tissue of the flaps degenerates to form a dense layer of connective tissue, and at the same time the muscular trabeculse undergo a condensation. Some of_ them separate from the flaps, which represent the qtrio-_ vetiTricular valves, and form muscle bundles which may fuse throughout their entire length with the more compact portions of the ventricular walls, or else may be attached Fig. 138.—Diagrams showing the Development of the Auriculo- VENTRICULAR VaLVES. b, Muscular trabeculas; cht, chordae tendineae; mk and mk^, valve; pm, musculus papillaris; tc, trabeculse carnese; v, ventricle.— (Front Hertwig, after Gegenbaur.) only by their ends, forming loops; these two varieties of muscle bundles constitute the trabecule carnece o| Jthe adult heart. Other bundles may retain a transverse direction, passing across the ventricular cavity and farming the so- called moderator hands; while others, again, retaining their attachment to the valves, condeiise only at their lower ends to form the musculi papillares, their upper portions undergoing conversion into strong though slender fibrous cords, the chordce tcndinecE (Fig. 138). The endocardinal lining of the ventricles is at first a simple sac separated by a distinct interval from the myocar-

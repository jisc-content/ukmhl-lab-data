33^ THE PERICARDIUM AND PLEURO-PERITONEUM. ductus Cuvieri, formed by the union of the jugular and car- dinal veins, reach the heart. Its dorsal edge is continuous; in the niedian line with the mesoderm surrounding the diges- tive tract just opposite the region where the liver outgrowth will form, but laterally this edge is free and forms the ven- tral walls of the dorsal parietal recess. An idea of the rela- tions of the septum at this stage may be obtained from Fig. ajn Fig i88.—Reconstruction from a Rabbit Embryo of Nine Days SHOWING THE SePTUM TrANSVERSUM FROM AbOVE. am, A-mnion; af, atrium; dc, ductus Cuvieri; rpd, dorsal parietal recess. —(Ravn.) 188, which represents the anterior surface of the septum, together with the related parts, in a rabbit embryo of nine days.

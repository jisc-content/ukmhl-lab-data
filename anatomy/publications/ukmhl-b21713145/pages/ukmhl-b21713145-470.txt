456 CHAPTER XVL THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. Like the cells of the central nervous system, the sensory cells are all of ectodermal origin, and in lower animals, such as the earthworm, for instance, they retain their orig- inal position in the ectodermal epithelium throughout life. In the vertebrates, however, the majority of the sensory cells relinquish their superficial position and sink more or less deeply into the subjacent tissues, being represented by the posterior root ganglion cells and by the sensory cells of the special sense-organs, and it is only in the olfactory organ that the original condition is retained. Those cells which have withdrawn from the surface receive stimuli only through an overlying cell or cells, and in certain cases these transmitting cells are not specially differentiated, the ter- minal branches of the sensory dendrites ending among ordi- nary epithelial cells or in such structures as the Pacinian bodies or the end-bulbs of Krause situated beneath undiffer- entiated epithelium. Li other cases, however, certain spe- cially modified superficial cells serve to transmit the stimuli to the peripheral sensory neurones, forming such structures as the hair-cells of the auditory epithelium or of the taste- buds. Thus three degrees of differentiation of the special sen- sory cells may be recognized and a classification of the sense-organs may be made upon this basis. One organ, however, the eye, cannot be brought into such a classifica- tion, since its sensory cells present certain developmental

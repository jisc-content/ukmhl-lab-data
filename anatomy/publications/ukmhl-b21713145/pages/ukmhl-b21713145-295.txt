DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. 2»I inhibitions of its development. These anomalies affect espe- cially the post-renal portion, a persistence of both cardinals (interpreting the conditions in the terms of what occurs in the rabbit) giving rise to a double post-renal cava, or a persistence of the left cardinal and the disappearance of the right to a vena cava situated on the left side of the vertebral column and crossing to the right by way of the left renal vein. So, too, the occurrence of accessory renal veins passing dorsal to the ureter is explicable in the supposition that they represent por- tions of the supracardinal system of veins. It has already been noted that thej3ortions of the pos- terior cardinals immediately anterior to the entrance of the renal veins disappear. The upper par^ of the ri^ht vein persists, however, and becomes the vena asygos of the adult, while the upper portion of the left vein sends a cross-branch over to unite with the azygos and then separates from the coronary sinus to form the vena hemiazygos. At least this is what is described as occurring in the rabbit. In the cat, however, only the very uppermost portion of the right pos- terior cardinal persists and the greater portion of the azygos and perhaps the entire hemiazygos vein is formed from the prerenal portions of the supracardinal veins, the right one joining on to the small persisting upper portion of the right posterior cardinal, while the cross-connection between the hemiazygos and azygos represents one of the originally numerous cross-connections between the supracardinals. The ascending lumbar veins, frequently described as the commencements of the azygos veins, are in reality secondary formations developed by the anastomoses of anteriorly and posteriorly directed branches of the lumbar veins. The Development of the Veins of the Limbs.—The devel- opment of the limb veins of the human embryo requires further investigation, but from a comparison of what is known with what has been observed in rabbit embryos it may be presumed that the changes which take place are somewhat as follows: In the anterior extremity the blood 25 ^

THE DECIDUA VERA. the rest of the decidua which encloses the ovum is termed the dccidiia capsularis (dccidiia rcHcxa) (C). The changes which give rise to the decidua vera may first be described and those occurring in the others consid- ered in succession. (a) Decidua vera.—On opening a uterus during the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy, when the decidua vera is at the height of its development, the surface of the mucosa presents a corrugated appearance and is tra- versed by irregular and rather deep grboves (Fig. 73). This appearance ceases at the internal orifice, the mu- cous membrane of the cervix uteri not forming a decidua, and the de- ciducTS of the two surfaces of the uterus are separated by a distinct furrow known as the marginal groove.

' In sections the mucosa" is found to have become greatly thickened, frequently measuring i cm. in thickness, and its glands have undergone very considerable modification. Normally almost straight (Fig. 74, A), they increase in

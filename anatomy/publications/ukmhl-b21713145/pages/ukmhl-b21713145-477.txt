THE INTERNAL EAR. of the central portion of each fold come together, fuse, and finally become absorbed, leaving the free edge of the fold as a crescentic canal, at one end of which an enlargement appears to form the ampulla. The transformation of the folds into canals takes place somewhat earlier in the cases of the two vertical than in that of the horizontal duct, as Fig. 248.—Reconstruction of the Otocysts of Embryo of {A) 6.9 MM. AND (5) 10.2 MM. dc.

A short distance below the level at which the canals com- municate with the remaining portion of the otocyst a con- striction appears, indicating a separation of the otocyst into a more dorsal portion and a more ventral one.

453 TI-IE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. The cells which occur in the peripheral plexuses have, in a similar manner, wandered out from their original posi- tion in the cell column. In lo mm. embryos groups of such cells have been observed both in the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach (Fig. 244*), where they become connected with a plexus formed by fibers from the vagus nerves (rv). The wandering of sympathetic cells into the walls of the intestine has also been observed, and they form at first a single layer in the mesoderm of the intestinal wall, only later, on the differentiation of the muscle layers, becom- ing separated into the two layers which constitute the plex- uses of Auerbach and Meissner. Similarly cells reach the heart by wandering in some cases along fibers of the vagus, although they really, come from the cervical region of the ganglionated cord, and, having in their wandering met with fibers of the vagus, make use of them as paths by which they mav reach their destination. As regards the cephalic sympathetic ganglia, the observa- tions of Remak on the chick and Kolliker on the rabbit show that the ciliary, sphenopalatine, and otic ganglia arise by the separation of cells from the semilunar (Gasserian) gan- glion, and from their adult relations it may be supposed that the cells of the submaxillary and sublingual ganglia have similarly arisen from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Evidence has also been obtained from human em- bryos that sympathetic cells are derived from the ganglia of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, but, instead of forming distinct ganglia in the adult, these, in all proba- bility, associate themselves with the first cervical ganglia of the ganglionated cord.

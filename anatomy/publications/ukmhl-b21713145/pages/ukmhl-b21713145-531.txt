The upper epiphysis of the femur is entirely unossified at birth and consists of a cartilaginous mass, much broader than the rather slender shaft and possessing a deep notch upon its upper surface (Fig. 277). This notch marks off the great trochanter from the head of the bone, and at this stage of development there is no neck, the head being prac- tically sessile. As development proceeds the inner upper portion of the shaft grows more rapidly than the outer por- tion, carrying the head away from the great trochanter and forming the neck of the bone. The acetabulum is shallower at birth than in the adult and cannot contain more than half the head of the femur; consequently the articular portion of the head is much less extensive than in the adult. It is a well-known fact that the new-born child habitually holds the feet with the soles directed toward one another, a position only reached in the adult with some difficulty, and associated with this supination or inversion there is a pro- nounced extension of the foot {i. e., flexion upon the leg as usually understood; see p. 91), it being difficult to flex the child's foot beyond a line at right angles with the axis

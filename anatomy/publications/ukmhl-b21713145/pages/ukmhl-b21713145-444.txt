Before considering these, however, certain changes which occur in the neighborhood of the lateral cerebral fossa may be described. The fossa is at first a triangular depression situated above the temporal lobe on the surface of the hemisphere. During the fourth month it deepens considerably, so that its upper and lower margins become more pronounced and Fig. 236.—Cerebral Hemisphere of an Embryo of about the Seventh s, Superior frontal sulcus; ip, interparietal; IR, insula; pci, inferior pre-central; pes, superior pre-central; ptc, post-central; R, central; .S", lateral; t^, first temporal.— (Cunningham.) form projecting folds, and, during the fifth month, these two folds approach one another and eventually cover in the floor of the fossa completely, the groove which marks the line of their contact forming the lateral cerebral fissure, while the floor of the fossa becomes known as the insula. The first of the secondary fissures to appear is the sulcus cingiilij which is formed about the middle of the fifth month Month.

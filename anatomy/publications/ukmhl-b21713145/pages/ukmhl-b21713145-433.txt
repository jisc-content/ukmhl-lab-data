419 THE ISTHMUS. the cerebelkim dojiojLmake their appearance until aboutjhe sixth month, when they are to be found in the ependymal tissue on_tlie inner surface of the layer of granular cells. Tliose which are not commissural or associative, in function converge to the line~oF junction of the cerebellum with_ the pons, and there pass into, the marginal velum of the pons, myelencephalon, or isthmua as the case may be. The dorsal surface of the isthmus is at first barely dis- tinguishable from the cerebellum, but as development pro- ceeds its roof-plate undergoes changes similar to those occurring in the medulla oblongata and becomes converted,^ into the anterior velun\. In the dorsal portion of its mar- ginal velum fibers_passing to and from the cerebellum ap- pear and form the brachia c0n iunctiva.. while ventrally fibers^escending from the more anterior portions of the brain_, form the cerebral peduncles. Nothing is at present known as to the history of the gray matter of this division of the brain, although it may be presumed that its ventral zones take part in the formation of the tegmentum, while from its dorsal zones the nuclei of the brachia conjunctiva are possibly derived. The following table gives the origin of the principal struc- tures of the metencephalon and isthmus: Roof-plate, Dorsal zones, Posterior velum. Anterior velum. Vermis of cerebellum. Lobes of cerebellum. Brachia conjunctiva. Flocculi. Nuclei of termination of sensory roots of cranial ^ nerves. Pons nuclei. Nuclei of origin of motor Posterior part of cere- roots of cranial nerves. bral peduncles. Reticular formation. Posterior part of teg- mentum. Floor-plate, Median raphe. Median raphe. Ventral zones,

Since it is part of the area of contact with the ovum it possesses no epithehum upon the surface turned toward the ovum, aUhough in the earher stages its surface is covered by an epithehum continuous with that of the decidua vera, and between it and the chorion there is a portion of the blood extravasation in which the villi formed from the chorion laeve float. Glands and blood- vessels also occur in its walls in the earlier stages of development. As the ovum continues to increase in size the capsularis begins to show signs of degeneration, these appearing first over the pole of the ovum opposite the point of fixation. Here, even in the case described by Rossi Doria, it has become reduced t^_a^ thin membrane destitute of either blood-vessels or glands, and the degeneration gradually extends throughout the entire capsule, the blood space which it encloses also disappearing.

(c) Dcxidiia basalis.â€”The structure of the decidua ba- salis, also known as the decidua serotina, is practically the same as that of the vera up to about the fifth month. It differs only in that, being part of the area of contact of the ovum, it loses its epithelium much earlier and is also the seat of extensive blood extravasations,''due to the erosion of its vessels by the chorionic trophoderm.^ Its glands, however, undergo the same changes as those of the vera, so that in it also a compactum and a spongiosum may l)e recognized. Beyond the fifth month, however, there is a p-reat difference between it and the vera, in that, being con- cerned with the nutrition of the embryo, it does not partake

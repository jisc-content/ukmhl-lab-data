16 SPERMATOGENESIS. The transformation of the spermatids into spermatozoa takes place while they are in intimate association with the Sertoli cells, a number of them fusing with the cytoplasm of an enlarged Sertoli cell, as shown in Fig. 6, s, and prob- ably receiving nutrition from it. In each spermatid there is present, in addition to the nucleus, an archoplasm sphere, from which the centrosomes have migrated so as to lie free in the cytoplasm. The details of the transformation are still to a certain extent under dis- cussion, the view here pre- sented being only one of the many which have been ad- vanced within recent years. On the fusion of the sper- matid with a Sertoli cell, a delicate filament (Fig. 8, /), the beginning of the axial fila- ment of the spermatozoon, appears in its cytoplasm, seem- ing to arise from the centro- some which lies at one end of it. The archoplasm sphere (a) and centrosome migrate to alTi/.r;*.""''''"'''"'- °PP°'''^ «ides of the nucleus, which gradually assumes an excentric position, and the archoplasm becomes converted into the head-cap (he) while the centrosomes, enlarging, form the anterior portion or neck of the middle-piece (mp), the remainder of that structure being formed from the axial filament surrounded by a cytoplasmic sheath. As the axial filament lengthens the cytoplasm is drawn out with it to Fig. 8.—Four Stages in the Transformation of a Sper- matid INTO THE Spermato- zoon OF A Rat. a, Archoplasm; c, mass of chro- matin which is later ahsorbed; axial filament; /;, head; he,

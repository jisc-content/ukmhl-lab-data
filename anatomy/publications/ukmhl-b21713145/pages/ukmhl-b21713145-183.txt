169 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRA. chord which is derived from the anterior half of the sclero- tome associates itself with the posterior portion of the pre- ceding sclerotome to form what will later be a vertebra, the tissue occupying- and adjacent to the line of division between the anterior and posterior portions of the sclero- tomes condensing to form intervertebral fibrocartilages. Consequently each vertebra is formecMjvL parts from two sclerotomeSj, the original intersegmental artery passes over the body of a vertebra, and the vertebrae themselves alter- nate with the myotomes. With this differentiation the first or blastemic stage of the development of the vertebrae closes. In the second or cartilaginous stage, portions of the, scle- rotomic mesenchyme become transformed into cartilage. In the posterior portion of each vertebral body, that is to say in the portion formed from the anterior halves of the more posterior of the two pairs of sclerotomes entering into its formation, two centers of chondrification appear, one on each side of the median line, and these eventually unite to form a single cartilaginous body, the chondrification prob- ably also extending to some extent into the denser anterior portion of the body. A center also appears in each half of the vertebral arch and in each costal process, the carti- lages formed in the costal processes of the anterior cervical region uniting across the median line below the notochord, to form what has been termed a hypochordal bar (Figs. 94 and 95). These bars are for the most part but transitory, recalling structures occurring in the lower vertebrates; in the mammalia they degenerate before the close of the carti- laginous stage of development, except in the case of the atlas, whose development will be described later. As development proceeds the cartilages of the vertebral arches and costal processes increase in length and come into con- tact with the cartilaginous bodies, with which they even- tually fuse, and from the vertebral arches processes grow 16

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. V The increasing interest in human and mammalian em- bryology which has characterized the last few years has resulted in many additions to our knowledge of these branches of science, and has necessitated not a few correc- tions of ideas formerly held. In this third edition of this book the attempt has been made to incorporate the results of all important recent contributions upon the topics dis- cussed, and, at the same time, to avoid any considerable increase in the bulk of the volume. Several chapters have, therefore, been almost entirely recast, and the subject matter has been thoroughly revised throughout, so that it is hoped that the book forms an accurate statement of our present knowledge of the development of the human body. In addition to the works mentioned in the preface to the first edition as of special value to the student of Em- bryology, mention should be made of the Handbuch der vergleichenden und experimentellen Entzvicklungslehre der Wirbeltiere edited by Professor Oscar Hertwig.

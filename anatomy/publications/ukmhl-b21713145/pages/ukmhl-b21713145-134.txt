120 THE ALLANTOIS AND BELLY-STALK. as is the case in the egg-laying forms. Thus, the endo- dermal portion of the allantois, instead of arising from the intestine and pushing before it a layer of splanchnic meso- derm to form a large sac lying freely in the extra-embryonic portion of the body-cavity, appears in the human embryo before the intestine has differentiated from the yolk-sac and pushes its way into the solid mass of mesoderm which forms I the belly-stalk (Fig. 63, A). To understand the signifi- cance of this process it is necessary to recall the abbrevia- tion in the human embryo of the development of the extra- embryonic mesoderm and body-cavity. Instead of grow- ing out from the embryonic area, as it does in the lower forms, this mesoderm develops in situ by splitting off from the layer _of enveloping cells and, furthermore, the extra- embryonic body-cavity arises by a splitting of the mesoderm so formed before there is any trace of a splitting of the embryonic iTiesodcrni (Figs. 36 and 35). The belly-stalk, whose development from a portion of the inner cell- mass has already been traced (p. 70), is to be regarded as a portion of the body of the em- bryo, since the ectoderm which covers one surface of it resem- bles exactly that of the embry- onic disk and shows an exten- sion backward of the medullary groove upon its surface (Fig. 64). The mesoderm, therefore, of the belly-stalk is to be regarded as a portion of the embryonic mesodernj which hasjiot yet undergone a splitting into somatic and splanchnic layers, and,jndeed, it never does undergo sucli a splittingr soJha^_the^^ whichIhe'endodermal allantoic diverticulum can grow.

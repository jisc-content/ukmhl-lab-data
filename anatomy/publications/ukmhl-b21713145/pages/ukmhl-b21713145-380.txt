366 THE METANEriiROS. somewhat voluminous structure, projecting markedly into the coelomic cavity (Fig. 203). It is attached to the dorsal wall of the body by a distinct mesentery and has in its lateral portion, embedded in its substance, the Wolffian duct, while on its mesial surface anteriorly is the but slightly developed genital ridge (t). This condition is reached in the human embryo at about the sixth or seventh week of development, and after that period the mesonephros under- goes rapid degeneration, so that at about the sixteenth week nothing remains of it except the duct and a few small rudi- ments whose history will be given later. The Development of the Metanephros.—The first por- tion of the metanephros to appear is a tubular outgrowth from the dorsal surface of the Wolffian duct, shortly before its en- trance into the cloaca (Fig. 163). As this' outgrowth _ elongates__.it comes to lie dorsal to _ the mesonephros and its anterior extremity becomes enlarged jand lobed, and also becomes surrounded by a conden- sation of mesenchynie^ which has been termed the metanephric blastepia. _ThQ outgrowth makes its ap- pearance in embryos of about 5 mm., but its anterior ex- tremity does not reach its final position in the neighborhood of the suprarenal 1x)dy until the third month of development. The extremity of the outgrowth early begins to divide within the substance of the blastema and thus gives rise to a number of branches, each of which terminates in an Fig. 204.—Diagrams of Early Stages IN THE Development of the Meta- NEPHRic Tubules. t, Urinary tubule; Ur, ureter; v, renal ampulla.— (Haycraft.)

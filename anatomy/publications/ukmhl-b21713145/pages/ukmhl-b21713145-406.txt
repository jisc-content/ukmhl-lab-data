392 " CHAPTER XIV. THE SUPRARENAL SYSTEM OF ORGANS. To the suprarenal system a number of bodies of peculiar structure, probably concerned with internal secretion, may be assigned. In the fishes they fall into two distinct groups, the one containing organs derived from the coelomic e2ithdium__and known as interrenal organs, and the other consisting of organs derived from the sympathetic nervous s^^tem and which, on account of the characteristic affinity they possess for chromium salts, have been termed the chromaffine organs. But in the amphibia and amniote vertebrates, while both the groups are represented by inde- pendent organs, yet they also become intimately associated to form the suprarenal glands, so that, notwithstanding their distinctly different origins, it is convenient to consider them together. The Development of the Suprarenal Bodies.â€”The suprarenal bodies make their appearance at an,early stage, while the Wolffian bodies are still in a well-developed con;: dition, and they are situated at first to the medial side of the upper ends of these structures (Fig. 203, sr). Their final relation to the metanephros is a secondary event, and is merely a topographic relation, there being no develop- mental relation between the two structures. In the human embryo they make their appearance at about the beginning of the fourth week of development as a number of proliferations of the coelomic epithelium, which ]3roiect into the subjacent mesenchyme, and are situ- ated on eithei^^^de ^Jhe median line between the root of

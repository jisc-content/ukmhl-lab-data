DEVELOPMENT OP"" EXTERNAL FORM. .83 end of the body there has developed a rather abruptly con- ical tail filament, in the place of the blunt and gradually tapering termination seen in earlier stages, and a well- marked rotundity of the abdomen, due to the rapidly in- creasing size of the liver, begins to become evident. In later stages the enclosure of the yolk- and belly-stalks within the umbilical cord proceeds until finally the cord is complete through the entire interval between the embryo Pig. 49.—A, Embryo 15 mm. Long (showing Ectopia of the Heart) ; B, Embryo L3, 17.5 mm. Long—(His.) and the wall of the ovum. At the same time the straight- ening out of the embryo continues, as may be seen in Fig. 48 representing the embryo xlv (Br.^) of His, which shows also, both in front of and behind the neck bend, a distinct depression, the more anterior being the occipital and the more posterior the neck depression; both these depressions are the expressions of changes taking place in the central nervous system. The tail filament has become more

396 THE INTERCAROTID GANGLIA. stand ill intimate relation with the branches of an inter- carotid sympathetic plexus, and, furthermore, they are characterized by possessing as their specific constituents markedly chromaffine cells, among which are scattered stellate cells resembling the cells of the sympathetic ganglia. They have been found to arise in pig embryos of 44 mm. by the separation of cells from the ganglionic masses scat- tered throughout the carotid sympathetic plexuses. These Fig. 218.—Section of a Cell Ball from the Intercarotid Ganglion OF Man. be Blood capillaries; ev, efferent vein; S, connective-tissue septum; I, trabecule.—(From Bohm and Davidoft, after bchaper.) cells, which become the chromaffine cells, arrange them- selves in round masses termed cell balls, many of which unite to form each ganglion, and in man each cell ball becomes broken up into trabeculse by the blood-vessels (Fig. 218) which penetrate its substance, and the individual balls are separated from one another by considerable quantities of connective tissue.

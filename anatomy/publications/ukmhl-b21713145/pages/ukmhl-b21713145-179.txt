165 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. at the same time, it grows in thickness with equal rapidity until the bone reaches its required length, whereupon the rapidity of the growth of the cartilage diminishes and it gradually becomes completely ossi- fied, uniting together the epiphysis and diaphysis. The growth in thickness of the long bones is, however, an entirely different process, and is due to the formation of new layers of periosteal bone on the outside of those already present. But in connection with this process an absolution of bone also takes place. A section through the middle of the shaft of a hume- rus, for example, at an early stage of development would show a peripheral zone of compact bone surrounding a core of spongy bone, the meshes of the latter being occu- pied by the marrow tissue. A sim- ilar section of an adult bone, on the other hand, would show only the peripheral compact bone, much thicker than before and enclosing a large marrow cavity in which no trace of spongy bone might remain. The difference depends on the fact that as the periosteal bone increases in thickness, there is a gradual absorption of the spongy bone and also of the earlier layers of periosteal bone, this absorption being carried on by large multinucleated cells, termed osteoclasts, derived from the marrowj-nesenchyme. By their action the bone is enabled Fig. 91.—The Ossifica- tion Centers of the Femur. a, and h, Secondary cen- ters for the great and lesser trochanters; d, diaphysis; ep, upper and ep', lower epiphy- sis.— (Testut.)

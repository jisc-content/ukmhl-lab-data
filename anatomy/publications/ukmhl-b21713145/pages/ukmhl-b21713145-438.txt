The Development of the Telencephalon.â€”For convenience of description the telencephalon may be regarded as con- sisting of a median portion, which contains the anterior part of the third ventricle, and two lateral outgrowths which con- stitute the cerebral hemispheres. The roof of the median portion undergoes the same transformation as does the greater portion of that of the diencephalon and is converted into the anterior part of the velum interpositum (Fig. 226, vi). Anteriorly this passes into the anterior wall of the third ventricle, the lamina terminalis (It), a structure which is to be regarded as formed by the union of the dorsal zones *of opposite sides, since it lies entirely dorsal to the anterior end of the sulcus Monroi. From the ventral part of the dorsal zones the optic evaginations are formed, a depression, the optic recess (or), marking their point of origin. The ventral zones are but feebly developed, and form the anterior part of the hypothalamic region, while at the ante- rior extremity of the floor-plate an evagination occurs, the infundibular recess (ir), which elongates to form a funnel- shaped structure known as the hypophysis. At its extremity the hypophysis comes in contact during the fifth week with the enlarged extremity of Rathke's pouch formed by an invagination of the roof of the oral sinus (see p. 301). and applies itself closely to the posterior surface of this (Fig. 219) to form with it the pituitary body. The anterior lobe at an early stage separates from the mucous membrane of

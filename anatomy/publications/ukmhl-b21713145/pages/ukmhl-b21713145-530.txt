The dates in italics are before birth. So far as actual changes in the form of the appendicular bones are concerned, these are most marked in the case of the lower limb. The ossa innominata alter somewhat in their proportions after birth, a fact which may conveniently be demonstrated by considering the changes which occur in the proportions of the pelvic diameters, although it must be remembered that these diameters are greatly influenced by the development of the sacral curve. Taking the conju- gate diameter of the pelvic brim as a unit for comparison, the antero-posterior (dorso-ventral) and transverse diame- ters of the child and adult have the proportions shown in the table on the opposite page (Fehling). It will be seen from this that the general form of the pelvis in the new-born child is that of a cone, gradually diminishing in diameter from the brim to the outlet, a con- dition very different from what obtains in the adult.

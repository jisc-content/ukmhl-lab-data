DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. 76 t dorsal surface of the body was distinctly concave from before backward, a peculiarity which becomes more pro- nounced in a later stage and constitutes what is termed the dorsal flexure. This is well shown in an embryo described by His and named by him embryo lxviii (Lg) (Fig. 43). In it the yolk-sac forms a much smaller portion of the ventral sur- face than it did in earlier stages, and it has also become distinctly separated from the belly-stalk. The most pecu- liar feature of this embryo is, however, the dorsal flexure. This is apparently a normal feature and is probably pro- duced by a difference in the rate of growth of the lateral and median portions of the outer layer of the embryonic mesoderm, the former portion failing to keep pace with the growth of the latter, which becomes folded in accom- modation to the strain. The flexure is of comparatively short duration, and when once it begins to disappear it seems to do so rapidly, the dorsal concavity suddenly be- coming a convexity and the tension of the layer coming into equilibrium in the new position. One other feature is noteworthy in this embryo-â€”namely, the occurrence of two linear vertical depressions a little behind the head region of the embryo; these are the first representatives of a series of branchial clefts. These structures are of great morphological importance, inasmuch as they determine to a large extent the arrange- ment of various organs of the head region. They repre- sent the clefts which exist in the walls of the phar3aix in fishes, through which water, taken in at the mouth, passes to the exterior, bathing on its way the gill filaments attached to the bars or arches, as they are termed, which separate successive clefts. Hence the name " branchial " which is applied to them, though in the mammals they never have respiratory functions to perform, but, appearing, persist

THE PERITONEUM. 344 mesentery. When the separation is taking place, tlie rota- tion of the stomach already descril^ed (p. 319) occurs, with the result that the portion of the ventral mesentery which stretches between the lesser curvature of the stomach and the liver shares in the rotation and comes to lie in a plane practically at right angles with that of the suspensory ligament, its surfaces looking dorsally and ventrally and its free edge being directed toward the right. This portion of the ventral mesentery forms what is termed the ksser omentum, and between it and the dorsal surface of the stomach as the ventral boundaries, and the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity dorsally, there is a cavity, whose floor is formed by the dorsal mesentery of the stomach, the meso- gastrium, the roof by the under surface of the left half of the liver, while to the right it communicates with the gen- eral peritoneal cavity dorsal to the free edge of the lesser omentum. This cavity is known as the bursa omentalis (lesser sac of the peritoneum), and the opening into it from the general cavity or greater sac is termed the epiploic fora- men (foramen of Winslow). Later, the floor of the lesser sac is drawn downward to form a broad sheet of peritoneum lying ventral to the coils of the small intestine and consist- ing of four layers; this represents the great omentum of adult anatomy (Fig. 194). Although the form assumed by the bursa omentalis is associated with the rotation of the stomach, it seems prob- able that its real origin is independent of that process (Bro- man). The subserous tissue of the transverse septum is at first thick and includes not only the liver, but also the pan- creas and the portion of the digestive tract which becomes the stomach and the upper part of the duodenum (Fig. 189, A). The shrinkage of this tissue by which these organs become separated from the septum cannot take place evenly on account of the relations which the organs bear

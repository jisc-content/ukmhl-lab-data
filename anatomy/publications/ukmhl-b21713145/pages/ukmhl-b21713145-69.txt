55 FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. row band of cells on each side of the sac of secondary endoderm. After the absorption of the ventral wall of the invag-ination a folding or turning in of the margins of the secondary endoderm occurs (Fig. 27), whereby its lumen becomes reduced in size and it passes off on each side into a double plate of cells which constitute the gastral meso- derm. Later these plates separate from the archenteron Fig. 27.—Diagrams Illustrating the Formation of the Gastral Mesoderm in the Gecko. ce, Chorda endoderm; cc, ectoderm; en, secondary endoderm; primary endoderm; gm, gastral mesoderm.— (Will.) as in the lower forms. All the prostomial mesoderm does not, however, arise from the primitive streak region, but a considerable amount also has its origin from the ectoderm covering the yolk outside the limits of the blastoderm proper, a mode of origin which serves to explain the phenomena later to be described for the mammalia. In comparison with the amphibians and Ainphioxus, the reptilia present a subordination of the process of invagina- tion in the formation of the endoderm, a primary endoderm

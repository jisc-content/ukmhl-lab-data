496 THE VITREOUS TIUMOR. ing to produce a cavity traversed by scattered fibers and known as the canal of Petit. A participation of similar protoplasmic prolongations from the cells of the lens in the formation of the vitreous humor has been maintained (von Lenhossek) and as strenu- ously denied. But it is generally admitted that at the time when the hyaloid artery penetrates the vitreous to form the tunica vasculosa lentis it carries with it certain mesodermal elements, whose fate is at present uncertain. It has been held that they take part in the formation of the definitive vitreous, which, according to this view, is of mixed origin, being partly ectodermal and partly mesodermal (Van Pee), and, on the contrary, it has been maintained that they even- tually undergo complete degeneration, the vitreous being of purely ectodermal origin (von Kolliker). Tlie degeneration of the mesodermal elements which the latter view supposes is associated with the degeneration of the hyaloid artery. This begins in human embryos in the third month and is completed during the ninth month, the only trace after birth of the existence of the vessel being a more fluid consistency of the axis of the vitreous humor, this more fluid portion representing the space originally occupied by the artery and forming what is termed the Jiya^ hid CM^-i^UML^t^i-'^Q'!'''^'^ - The Development of the Outer Coat of the Eye, of the Cornea, and of the Anterior Chamber.â€”Soon after the formation of the optic bulb a condensation of the meso- derm cells around it occurs, forming a capsule. Over the medial portions of the optic cup the further differentiation of this capsule is comparatively simple, resulting in the for- mation of two layers, an inner vascular and an outer denser and fibrous, the former becoming the chorioid coat of the adult eye and the latter the sclera. More laterally, however, the processes are more compli-

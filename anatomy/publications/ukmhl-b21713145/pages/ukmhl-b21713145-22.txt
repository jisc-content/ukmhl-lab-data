8 INTRODUCTION. ment of the reproductive activities of the cells. In actively reproducing cells the mitotic method of division may be regarded as the rule. Since the process of development consists of the multi- plication of a single original cell and the differentiation of the cell aggregate so formed, it follows that the starting- point of each line of individual development is to be found in a cell which forms part of an individual of the preceding generation. In other words, each individual represents one generation in esse and the succeeding generation in posse. This idea may perhaps be made clear by the following con- siderations. As a result of the division of a fertilized ovum there is produced an aggregate of cells, which, by the physio- logical division of labor, specialize themselves for various functions. Some assume the duty of perpetuating the spe- cies and are known as the sexual or germ cells, while the remaining ones divide among themselves the various func- tions necessary for the maintenance of the individual, and may be termed the somatic cells. The germ cells represent potentially the next generation, while the somatic cells con- stitute the present one. The idea may be represented schematically thus: First generation Somatic cells -|- germ cells Second generation Somatic cells -f germ cells Third generation Somatic cells germ cells, etc It is evident, then, while the somatic cells of each genera- tion die at their appointed time and are differentiated anew for each generation from the germ cells, the latter, which may be termed collectively the germ-plasm, are handed on from generation to generation without interruption, and it

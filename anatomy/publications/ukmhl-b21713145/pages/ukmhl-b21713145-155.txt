141 THE PLACENTA. sections of the villi (vi) cut in various directions. Then follows the stratum compactum of the basalis, next the stratum spongiosum, next the outermost layer of the mucosa (D"). in which the uterine glands retain their epithelium, and, finally, the muscularis uteri (Mc). ^ These various structures which enter into the composi- tion of the placenta have, for the most part, been already described, and it remains here only to say a few words con- cerning the special structure of the basal compactum and concerning the origin of the intervillous space and its rela- tions to the villi and the maternal vessels. From the surface of the compactum processes arise, termed septa, which project into the intervillous space, grouping the villi into cotyledons and giving attachment to some of the fixation villi (Fig. 76). Throughout the greater extent of the placenta the septa do not reach the surface of_the chorion, but at the periphery, throughout a narrow- zone, they do come into contact with the chorion and unite beneath it to form a membrane which has been termed the closing plute. Beneath this lies the peripheral portion of the intervillous space, which, ownng to the ar- rangement of the septa in this region, appears to be imper- fectly separated from the rest of the space and forms what is termed the marginal sinus (Fig. 77). The probable origin of the intervillous space by the effu- sion of blood from the maternal vessels throughout the area of contact with the ovum has already been described, and if this be the true method of its development, then it is evident that the fetal villi are_in_ direct, coiitacl^ with Jlie maternal blood contsiined in the space.

THE MULLERIAN DUCT. The Development of the Mullerian Duct and of the Genital Ridge.â€”At the time when the Wolffian body has almost reached its greatest development a second longitu- dinal duct makes its appearance in close proximity to the Wolffian. This is known as the Miillerian duct (Fig. 206, Md). Its development is preceded by the appearance of a distinct ridge or fold upon the ventral surface of the Wolffian body, extending from the under surface of the diaphragm above to the urogenital sinus below and con- taining in the lower portion of its course the Wolffian duct (Fig. 203). Near the anterior end of the mesonephros there grows into this fold an evagination from the peri- toneum covering the Wolffian ridge and by the proliferation of the cells at its tip this evagination gradually extends downward in the substance of the ridge, and in embryos of 22 mm. has reached the urogenital sinus. As they ap- proach the sinus, the right and left evaginations or Miil- lerian ducts gradually approach one another and finally fuse together to form a single tube in the lower part of their course, but they remain distinct above, each tube retaining its original opening into the peritoneal cavity. The genital ridge makes its appearance as a band-like thickening of epithelium extending lengthwise upon the mesial surface of the Wolffian body. The cells composing the thickening are arranged in several layers and are of two kinds: (i) smaller, cubical or spherical epithelial cells, with a relatively small amount of cytoplasm, and (2) large spherical cells with more abundant and clear cytoplasm, known as sex-cells. Later the thickening separates into two distinct layers, a superficial one which remains epi- thelial in character and contains the sex-cells, and a deeper one, composed only of smaller cells and known as the stroma layer, since its cells later become the stroma cells. From the epithelial layer columns of cells containing sex-

229 THE LIMB MUSCLES. Gradually superficial portions of the antibrachial flexor mass separate off, carrying with them the layers of the palmar aponeurosis from which the tendons representing the superficial layer of the palmar muscles arise, and they form with these the flexor digitorum sublimis. The deeper layers of the antibrachial flexor mass become the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor pollicis longus (Fig. 122, A), and retain their conection with the deeper layers of the palmar aponeurosis which form their tendons; and since the second layer of the palmar muscles takes origin from this portion of the aponeurosis it becomes the lumbrical muscles, arising from the profundus tendons (Fig. 122, B). The third layer of palmar muscles be- comes the adductors of the digits, reduced in man to the adductor pollicis, while from the two deepest layers the interossei are developed. Of these the fourth layer con- sists primarily of a pair of slips corresponding to each digit, while the fifth is represented by a series of muscles which extend obliquely across between adjacent metacarpals. With these last muscles certain of the fourth layer slips unite to form the dorsal interossei, while the rest become the volar interossei. The modifications of the almost identical primary ar- rangement in the crus and foot are somewhat different. The superficial layer of the crural flexors becomes the gas- trocnemius and plantaris (Fig. 123, A) and the deepest layer becomes the popliteus and the interosseous membrane. The second and third layers unite to form a common mass which is inserted into the deeper layers of the plantar apo- neurosis and later differentiates into the soleus and the long digital flexor, the former shifting its insertion from the plantar aponeurosis to the os calcis, while the flexor retains its connection with the deeper layers of the aponeurosis, these separating from the superficial layer to form the long

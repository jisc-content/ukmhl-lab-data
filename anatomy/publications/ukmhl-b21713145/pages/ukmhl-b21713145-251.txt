THE FORMATION OF THE BLOOD. off from the walls of existing capillaries which have grown in from extra-embryonic regions, is at present undecided. The Formation of the Blood.—The erythrocytes, which are the first blood-corpnscles, are all nucleated and are for a time the only cells occurring in the blood, though later other cells arising in tissues exterior to the Jjlood-yessds, makejheir way into the vessels, forming leukocytes. From their very first formation then the red_(erythrocytes) and white (leukocytes) blood-corpuscles have a different origin, andflhey remain distinct throughout life, one form never j becoming converted into the other. So long as the formation of blood-vessels is taking place in the extra-embryonic mesoderm, so long are new erythro- cytes being differentiated from the mesoderm. But whether the formation of blood-vessels within the embryo results from a differentiation of the embryonic mesoderm in sifu^ or ^frpm the_._actual ingrowth of vessels from the extra- embryonic regions (His), is as yet uncertain, and hence it is also uncertain whether erythrocytes are differentiated from the embryonic mesoderm or merely pass into the embryonic region from the more peripheral areas. However this may be, it is certain that the erythrocytes increase by division in the interior of the embryo, and that there are certain por- tions of the body in wliich these divisions take place most abundantly, partly, perhaps, on account_of the more favor- able conditions of nutrition which they present and partly k because they are regions where the circulation is sluggish and permits the accumulation of erythrocytes. These^ re- gions constitute what have been termed the hccmatot>oietic j| organs^ and are especially noticeable in the later stages of fetal life, dii™ishin^ in luimber and variety about the time of birth^ It must be remembered, however, that the life of in(lividual coqniscles is comparatively short, their death and disintegration taking place continually during the ent[re life

488 THE RETINA. of the retina (Fig*. 265, p). The retinal layer increases in thickness and early becomes differentiated into two strata (Fig. 261), a tiiicker one lying next the j)igment layer and containing numerous nuclei, and a thinner one containing no nuclei.. The thinner layer, from its position and structure, suggests an homology with the mar^ginal velum of the cen- tral nervous system, and probably becomes converted into 00 qO o o o Q Fig. 265—Portion of a Transverse Section of the Retina of a New-born Rabbit. ch, Chorioid coat; g, ganglion-cell layer; r, outer layer of nuclei; p, pig- ment layer.—(Fa/c/fJ.) the nerve-fiber layer of the adult retina, the axis-cylinder processes of the ganglion cells passing into it on their way to the optic nerve.

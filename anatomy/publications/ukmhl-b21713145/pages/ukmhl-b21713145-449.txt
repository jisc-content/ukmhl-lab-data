435 THE SPINAL NERVES. of development of the two roots of which the typical spinal nerves are composed, the ventral root being formed by axis- cylinders which arise from neuroblasts situated within the substance of the spinal cord, while the dorsal roots arise from the cells of the neural crests, their axis-cylinders grow- ing into the substance of the cord while their dendrites become prolong-ed peripherally to form the sensory fibers of the nerves. Throughout the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions of the cord the fibers which grow out from the anterior horn cells converge to form a single nerve-root in each segment, but in the cervical region fibers which arise from the more laterally situated neuroblasts make their exit from the cord independently of the more ventral neuroblasts and form the roots of the spinal accessory nerve (see p 444), In the cervical region there are accordingly three sets of nerve-roots, the dorsal, lateral, and ventral sets. In a typical spinal nerve, such as one of the thoracic series, the dorsal roots as they grow peripherally pass down- ward as well as outward, so that they quickly come into con- tact with the ventral roots with whose fibers they mingle, and the mixed nerve so formed soon after divides into two trunks, a dorsal one, which is distributed to the dorsal mus- culature and integimient, and a larger ventral one. The ventral division as it continues its outward growth soon reaches the dorsal angle of the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, where it divides, one branch passing into the tissue of the body-wall while the other passes into the splanchnic meso- derm. The former branch, continuing its onward course in the body-wall, again divides, one branch becoming the lateral cutaneous nerve, while the other continues inward to terminate in the median ventral portion- of the body as the anterior cutaneous nerve. The splanchnic branch forms a ramus communicans to the sympathetic system and will be considered more fully later on.

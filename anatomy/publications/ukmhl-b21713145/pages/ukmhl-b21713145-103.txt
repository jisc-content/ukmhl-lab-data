89 DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIMBS. esses by a deep and rather wide groove which anteriorly opens into a circular depression, the nasal pit (np). Later on the maxillary and globular processes unite, obliterating the groove and cutting off the nasal pits— which have by this time deepened to form the nasal fossae —from direct communication with the mouth, with which, however, they later make new communications behind the maxillary processes, an indication of the anterior and pos- terior nares being thus produced. Occasionally the maxillary and globular processes fail to unite on one or both sides, producing a condition popularly known as " harelip." At the time when this fusion occurs the nasal fossae are widely separated by the broad nasal process (Fig. 53), but during later development this process narrows to form the nasal septum and is gradually elevated above the general surface of the face as shown in Figs. 48-50. By the nar- rowing of the nasal process the globular processes are brought nearer together and form the portions of the upper jaw immediately on each side of the median line, the rest of the jaw being formed by the maxillary processes. In the meantime a furrow has appeared upon the mandibular process, running parallel with its borders (Fig. 49) ; the portion of the process in front of this furrow gives rise to the lower lip and is known as the lip ridge, while the portion behind the furrow becomes the lower jaw proper and is termed the chin ridge. The Development of the Limbs.—As has been already pointed out, the limbs make their appearance in an embryo measuring about 4 mm. in length (Fig. 45) and are at first l)ud-like in form. As they increase in length they at first have their long axes directed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body and become somewhat flattened at their free ends, remaining cylindrical in their proximal portions. 9

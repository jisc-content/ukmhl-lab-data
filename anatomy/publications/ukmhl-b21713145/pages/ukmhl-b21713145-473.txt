459 THE OLFACTORY ORGAN. eral prolongations ending freely among the cells of the ol- factory epithelium. These bipolar cells resemble closely in form and relations the cells of the embryonic posterior root, ganglia, and thus form an interesting transition between these and the neuro-epithelial cells. The Organ of Jacobson.â€”In embryos of three or four months a small pouch-like invagination of the epithelium covering the lower anterior portion of the median septum of the nose can readily be seen. This becomes converted into a slender pouch, 3 to 5 mm. long, ending blindly at its posterior extremity and opening at its other end into the nasal cavity. Its lining epithelium resembles that of the respiratory portion of the nasal cavity, and there is devel- oped in the connective tissue beneath its floor a slender plate of cartilage, distinct -from that forming the septum of the nose. This organ, which may apparently undergo degeneration in the adult, and in some cases completely disappears, ap- pears to be the representative of what is known as Jacobson's organ, a structure which reaches a much more extensive degree of development in many of the lower mammals, and in these contains in its epithelium sensory cells whose axis- cylinder processes pass with those of the olfactory sense cells to the olfactory bulbs. In man, however, it seems to be a rudimentary organ, and no satisfactory explanation of its function has as yet been advanced. The olfactory neuro-epithelium, considered from a com- parative standpoint, seems to have been derived from the system of lateral line organs so highly developed in the lower vertebrates (Kupffer). In higher forms the system, which is cutaneous in character, has disappeared except in two regions where it has become highly specialized. In one of these regions it has given rise to the olfactory sense cells and in the other to the similar cells of the auditory apparatus.

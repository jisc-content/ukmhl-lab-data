DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH. This they accompHsh, in the same manner as that in which the periosteal osteoblasts produce bone, depositing the den- tine between their surfaces and the adjacent surface of the enamel. The outer surface of each odontoblast is drawn out into a number of exceedingly fine processes which ex- tend into the dentine to occupy the minute dentinal tubules, just as processes of the osteoblasts occupy the canaliculi of bone. At ail early stage the enamel membrane forms an almost complete investment for the dental papilla (Fig. i66), but, as the ossification of the tooth proceeds, it recedes from the lower part, until finally it is confined entirely to the crown. The dentine forming the roots of the tooth then becomes enclosed in a layer of cement, which is true bone and serves to unite the tooth firmly to the walls of its socket. As the tooth increases in size, its extremity is brought nearer to the surface of the gum and eventually breaks through, the eruption of the first teeth usually taking place during the last half of the first year after birth. The growth of the permanent teeth proceeds slowly at first, but later it becomes more rapid and produces pressure upon the roots of the primary teeth. These roots then undergo partial absorp- tion, and the teeth are thus loosened in their sockets and are readily pushed out by the further growth of the permanent teeth. The dates and order of the eruption of the teeth are subject to considerable variation, but the usual sequence is somewhat as follows: Primary Dentition. Median incisors, 6th to 8th month. Lateral incisors, 7th to 9th month. First molars, ..., Beginning of 2d year. Canines, i^ years. Second molars, .3 to 3^ years. 27

THE BRAIN. 410 7i my vesicle an evagination appears and becomes converted into a club-shaped structure attached to the ventral portion of the vesicle by a pedicle. These evaginations (Fig. 225, op) are known as the Qplic evazinations, and being concerned in the formation of the eye will be considered in the succeeding chapter. After their forma- tion the antero-lateral portions of the vesicle become bulged out into two protuberances (/?) which rapidly increase in size and give rise eventually to the two cerebral .hemispheres, which form, together with the portion of the vesicle which lies between them, what is termed the telencephalon or fore-brain, the remainder of the vesicle giving rise to what is known as the diojccplwhui or 'Iwccn- brain (Fig. 225, t). The mid- dle vesicle is bodily converted into the mesencephalon or 7nid- brain (m), but the posterior vesicle differentiates so that three parts may be recognized: (i) a rather narrow portion which immediately succeeds the mid-brain and is termed the isthmus (i); (2) a portion whose roof and floor give rise to the cerebellum and pons respectively, and which is termed the metencephalon or hind-brain (mt) ; and (3) a terminal portion which is known as the medulla oblongata, or, to retain a consistent nomenclature, the myelencephalon or Fig. 225.—Reconstruction of THE Brain of an Embryo of 2.15 MM, h, Hemisphere; i, isthmus; m, mesencephalon; mf, mid-brain flexure; mt, metencephalon; my, myelencephalon ; nf, neck flexure; ot, otic capsule; op, optic evagination; t, dien- cephalon.— (His.)

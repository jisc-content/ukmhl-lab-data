THE LIMB MUSCLES. 226 eighth cervical and the first thoracic nerves, and only those supplied by the eighth cervical and the first thoracic nerves extend as far as the tips of the fingers. The arrangement of the bands in the upper part of the brachium may be seen from Fig. 121, in connection with which it must be noted that the fourth cervical band does not extend down to the level at which the section is taken and that the prae- axial band of the eighth cervical nerve and both the prae- axial and postaxial bands of the first thoracic are repre- sented only by connective tissue in this region. In another sense than the longitudinal one there is a division of the limb musculature into more or less definite areas, namely, in a transverse direction in accordance with the jointing of the skeleton. Thus, there may be recognized a group of muscles which pass from the axial skeleton to the pectoral girdle, another from the limb girdle to the brachium or thigh, another from the brachium or thigh to the antibrachium or crus, another from the antibrachium or crus to the carpus or tarsus, and another from the carpus or tarsus to the digits. This transverse segmentation, if it may be so termed, is not, however, perfectly definite, many muscles, even in the lower verte- brates, passing over more than one joint, and in the mam- malia, especially, it is further obscured by secondary migra- tions, by the partial degeneration of muscles and by an end to end union of primarily distinct muscles. The latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior and pectoral muscles are all examples of a process of migration as is shown by their innervation from cervical nerves, as well as by the actual migration which has been traced in the developing embryo (Mall, Lewis). In the lower limb evidences of migration may be seen in the femoral head of the biceps, comparative anatomy showing this to be a de- rivative of the gluteal set of muscles which has secondarily

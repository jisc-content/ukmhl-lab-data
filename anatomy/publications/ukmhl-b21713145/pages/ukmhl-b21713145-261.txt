THE FORMATION OF THE HEART. 247 and forms {^i) the Etistachianjuahe (Fig. 135, F^), guard- ing the Opening of the inferior cava and directing the blood entering by it toward the foramen ovale, and (2) the Thebesian valve, which guards the opening of the coronary sinus. At first no veins communicate with the left atrium, but on the development of the lungs and the establishment of their vessels, the pulmonary veins make connection with it. JTwo veins arise from each lung, and as^ they pass toward the heart they unite in pairs, the two vessels so formed again uniting to form a single short trunk which opens into the upper part of the atrium (Fig. 136, Vep). As is the case with the right atrium and the sinus venosus, the expansion of the left atrium brings about the absorp- tion of the short single trunk into its walls, and, the ex- pansion continuing, the two vessels are also absorbed, so that eventually the four primary veins- open independently into the atrium. While the atrial septa have been developing there has appeared on the dorsal wall of the ^atrial canal a tubercle- endocardium, and a similar thicken- ing also forms.on_the_ventral wall. Thgse. endocardial cushions increase in size and finahy unite together by their tips, forming a complete partition, diyiding the atrial canal into a right and left .half (Fig. 136). With^ the upper edge of this partition the thickened lower edge of the atrial septum^ unites^ so that the separation of the atria would be complete were it not for the foramen ovale. While these changes have been taking place in the atrial portion of the heart, the separation of the right and left ventricles has also been progressing, and in this two dis- tinct septa take part. From the floor of the ventriVnIqr cavity along the line of junction of Jhe_right_and left por- tions a ridge, composed largely of muscular tissue, arises (Figs. 134 and 136), and, growing more rapidly in its

DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. 72 toward the yolk-sac. This bending in proceeds most rap- idly at the anterior end of the body, as shown in the dia- grams (Fig. 39), and least rapidly at the posterior end where the belly-stalk is situated, and produces a constriction of the yolk-sac, the portion of that structure nearest the embryonic disk becoming enclosed within the body of the embryo to form the digestive tract, while the remainder is converted into a pedicle-like portion, the yolk-stalk, at the extremity of which is the yolk-vesicle. The further con- tinuance of the folding in of the edges of the embryonic area leads to an almost com- plete closing in of the di- gestive tract and reduces the Fig. 40.-EMBRY0 2.5 mm.

An embryo which exhibits an early stage in the process of constriction has been described by Allen Thompson and is represented in Fig. 40.* It measured about 2.5 mm. in length and had reached a stage in which the medullary folds had become very pronounced and their edges had come into contact at one portion, although the anterior and posterior portions of the groove {mg) between them were still widely open. The embryo will be seen from the figure to project somewhat both in front of and behind the yolk- sac, although the greater part of its ventral surface is still formed by that structure. At the sides also it is well sepa- rated from the yolk-sac, and resting upon the sac in front is a swelling which represents the heart. * It must be noted that in the figure neither the amnion (except for a small fragment still persisting in front) nor the belly-stalk is rcprcsenlcd.

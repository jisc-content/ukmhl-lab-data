THE PERITONEUM. 345 to one another, so that on the right side certain peritoneal recesses are formed, one between the right king and the stomach, a second between the hver and the stomach, and a third between the pancreas and the same structure. In man these three recesses communicate with one another to form the primary bursa omentahs, and open by a common epiploic foramen into the general peritoneal cavity. The rotation of the stomach, which takes place later, merely serves to modify and intensify the original bursa. In the human embryo a small recess also forms upon the left side between the left lung and the stomach, but it later becomes obliterated. Below the level of the upper part of the duodenum the ventral mesentery is wanting; only the dorsal mesentery occurs. So long as the intestine is a straight tube the length of the intestinal edge of this mesentery is practically equal to that of its dorsal attached edge. The intes- tine, however, increasing in length much more rapidly than the ab- dominal walls, the intestinal edse of the mesentery soon becomes very much longer than the attached edge, and when the intestine grows Fic. 191.—Diagra out into the umbilical coelom the mesentery accompanies it (Fig. 191). As the coils of the intestine develop, the intestinal edge of the mesentery is thrown into corres- ponding folds, and on the return of the intestine to the abdominal cavity the mesentery is thrown into a somewhat funnel-like form by the twisting of M SHOW- ING THE Arrangement OF THE Mesentery and Visceral Branches of THE Abdominal Aorta IN an Embryo of Si.\ Weeks. p, Pancreas; S, stomach; Sp, spleen.— (Toldt.)

These conditions are due apparently to the ex- tensor and tibialis muscles being relatively shorter and the opposing- muscles relatively longer than in the adult, and with the elongation or shortening, as the case may be, of the muscles on the assumption of the erect position, the bones in the neighborhood of the ankle-joint come into new relations to one another, the result being a modification of the form of the articular surfaces, especially of the talus Fig. 277.—Longitudinal Sections of the Head of the Femur of (A) New-born Child and (B) a Later Stage of Development. cp, Epiphysial center for the head; hj head; t, trochanter.— (Henke.) (astragalus). In the child the articular cartilage of the trochlear surface of this bone is continued onward to a con- siderable extent upon the neck of the bone, which comes into contact with the tibia in the extreme extension possible in the child. In the adult, however, such extreme extension being impossible, the cartilage upon the neck gradually dis- appears. The supination in the child brings the talus in close contact with the inner surface of the calcaneus and with the sustentaculum tali; with the alteration of position a growth of these portions of the calcaneus occurs, the sus-

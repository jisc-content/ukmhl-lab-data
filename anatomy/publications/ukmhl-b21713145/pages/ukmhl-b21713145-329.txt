THE BRANCHIAL EPITHELIAL BODIES. ever, only a relatively small portion of the entire thyreoid (Fig-. 173, thm IV). Two other pairs of bodies enter into intimate relations with the thyreoid, forming what have been termed the parathyreoid bodies (Fig. 172^ pt}^ and pth^). One of these pairs arises as a thick- />^^"" z^^- ening of the anterior /// wall of the fourth bran- j^^-^jB JS^/z/zw/// chial groove and the other comes from the corresponding wall of the third groove. The members of the former pair, after separating from their points of ori- gin, come to lie on the dorsal surface of the lateral portions of the thyreoid body (Fig. 173, pthm IV) in close prox- imity to the lateral thy- reoids, while those of the other pair, passing further backward, come to rest behind the lower border of the thyreoid (Fig"- 173. Pihm III). The cells of these bodies do not become divided into cords by the ingrowth of connective tissue to the same extent as those of the thyreoids, nor do they become sepa- rated into follicles, so that the bodies are readily distingiu'sh- able by their structure from the thyreoid.

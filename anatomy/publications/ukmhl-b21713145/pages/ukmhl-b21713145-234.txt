TI-IE LIMB MUSCLES. 220 The Limb Muscles.â€”It has been customary to regard the limb muscles as derivatives of certain of the myotomes, these structures in their growth ventrally in the trunk walls being supposed to pass out upon the postaxial surface of the limb buds and loop back again to the trunk along the prc-eaxial surface, each myotome thus giving rise to a por- tion of both the dorsal and the ventral musculature of the limb. This view has not, however, been verified by direct observation of an actual looping of the myotomes over the axis of the limb buds; indeed, on the contrary, the limb muscles have been found to develop from the cores of mesenchyme which form the axes of the limb buds and from which the limb skeleton is also developed. This may be explained by supposing that the limb muscles are primarily derivatives of the myotomes and that an extensive concen- tration of their developmental history has taken place, so that the axial mesenchyme actually represents myotomic material even though no direct connection between it and the myotomes can be discovered. Condensations of the developmental history certainly occur and the fact that the muscles of the human limbs, as they differentiate from the axial cores, present essentially the same arrangement as in the adult seems to indicate that there is actually an extensive condensation of the phylogenetic history of the individual muscles, since comparative anatomy shows the arrangement of the muscles of the higher mammalian limbs to be the result of a long series of progressive modifications from a primitive condition. However, even though this be the case, there is yet the possibility that the limb musculature, like the limb skeleton, may take its origin from the ventral mesoderm and consequently belong to a different embry- onic category from the axial myotomic muscles. The strongest evidence in favor of the myotomic origin of the limb muscles is that furnished by their nerve supply.

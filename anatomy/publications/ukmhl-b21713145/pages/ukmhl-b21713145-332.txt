3i8 THE (ESOPHAGUS. chial cartilages disappear; the muscles originally associated with these structures persist, however, and give rise to the muscles of the pharynx, which consequently are innervated by the ninth and tenth nerves. The Development of the CEsophagus.—From the ven- tral side of the lower portion of the pharynx an evagination develops at an early stage which is destined to give rise to the organs of respiration; the development of this may, however, be conveniently postponed to a later chapter (Chapter XII). The oesophagus is at first a very short portion of the archenteron (Fig. 175, but as the heart and diaphragm recede into the thorax, it elongates (Fig. 175, B) until it eventually forms a considerable portion of the digestive tract. Its endodermal lining, like that of the rest of the digestive tract except the pharynx, is surrounded by splanch- nic mesoderm whose cells become converted into non- striated muscular tissue, which, by the_fourth month, has separated into an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer. The Development of the Stomach and Intestines.— By the time the embryo has reached a length of about 3 mm. its constriction from the yolk-sac has proceeded so far that a jDortion of the digestive tract anterior to the yolk-sac can be recognized as the stomach and a portion posterior as the intestine. At first the stomach is a simple, spindle-shaped enlargement (Fig. 175) and the intestine a tube without any coils or bends, but since in later stages the intestine grows much more rapidly in length than the abdominal cavity, a coiling of the intestine becomes necessary. The elongation of the stomach early produces changes in its position, its lower end bending over toward the right, while its upper end, owing to the development of the liver, is forced somewhat toward the left. At the same time the

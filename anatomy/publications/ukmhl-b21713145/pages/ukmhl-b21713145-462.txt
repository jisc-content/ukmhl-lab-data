44^ THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. To understand the development of the sympathetic sys- tem it must be rememl^ered that it consists typically of three sets of ganglia. One of these is constituted by the ganglia of the ganglionated cord (Fig. 242, GC), the second is represented by the ganglia of the praevertebral plexuses {PVG), such as the cardiac, solar, hypogastric, and pelvic, while the third or peripheral set (PG) is formed by the cells which occur throughout the tissues of probably most of the visceral organs, either in small groups or scattered through plexuses such as the Auerbach and Meissner plex- FiG. 242.—Diagram showing the Arrangement of the Neurones OF THE Sympathetic System. The fibers from the posterior root ganglia are represented by the broken black lines; those from the anterior horn cells by the solid black; the white rami by red; and the sympathetic neurones by blue. DR, Dorsal ramus of spinal nerve; GC, ganglionated cord; GR, gray ramus communicans; PG, peripheral ganglion; PVG, praevertebral ganglion; VR, ventral ramus of spinal nerve; WR, white ramus communicans.— {Adapted from Hiibcr.) uses of the intestine. Each cell in these various ganglia stands in direct contact with the axis-cylinder of a cell situated in the central nervous system, probably in the lat- eral horn of the spinal cord or the corresponding region of the brain, so that each cell forms the terminal link of a chain whose first link is a neurone belonging to the central system (Huber).

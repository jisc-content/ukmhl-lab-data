Fusion of the two layers of mesoderm along the course of the veins now take place, and, each recess thus becomes divided into two parallel passages, which^have been termed the dorsal (Fig. 187, r/)i/)_and__ve_ntral .(^/'^) parie- tal recesses.

The dorsal recesses, however, retain their continuity with the trunk-cavity until a much later period. By the fusion of the omphalo-mesenteric veins mentioned above, there is formed a thick semilunar fold which projects horizontally into the ccelom from the ventral wall of the body and forms the floor of the ventral part of the parietal recess. This is known as the septum transversuni, and ^ besides containing the anterior portions of the omphalo- mesenteric veins, it also furnishes a passage by which the 30

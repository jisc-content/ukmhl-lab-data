THE LIVER. The bile capillaries seem to make their appearance first in cylinders which lie in close relation to branches of the portal vein (Fig. 184), and thence extend throughout the neighboring cylinders, anastomosing with capillaries devel- oping in relation to neighboring portal branches. As the extension so proceeds the older capillaries continue to en- large and later become transformed into hile-ducts (Fig. 184, C), the cells of the cylinders in which these capillaries were situated becoming converted into the epithelial lining of the ducts. ■ The lobules, which form so characteristic a feature of Fig. 184.—Injected Bile Capillaries of Pig Embryos of {A) 8 cm., (5) 16 CM., AND (C) OF Adult Fig.—(Hendrickson.) the adult liver, are late in appearing, not being fully devel- oped until some time after birth. They depend upon the relative arrangement of the branches of the portal and hepatic veins; these at first occupy distinct territories 01 the liver substance, being separated from one another by practically the entire thickness of the liver, although of course connected by the capillaries which lie between the hepatic cylinders. During development the two sets of branches extend more deeply into the liver substance each invadmg the territory of the other, but they can read'ily be 29

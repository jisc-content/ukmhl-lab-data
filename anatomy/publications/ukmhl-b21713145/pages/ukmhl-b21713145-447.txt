THE CORPUS CALLOSUM. 433 tlie hippocampus extend forward into the anterior portion of the hemispheres (Fig. 237), but on account of their posi- tion they become encroached upon by the enlargement of the corpus callosum, with the result that the hippocampus be- comes practically ob- literated in that por- tion of its course which lies in the re- gion occupied by the corpus callosum, its fissure in this region becoming known as the callosal fissure, while the correspond- ing portions of the dentate gyrus become reduced to narrow and insignificant bands of nerve-tissue which rest upon the upper surface of the corpus callosum and are known as the lateral longitudinal strict. Some doubt still exists as to the exact mode of formation of the fifth ventricle. Some authors maintain that it is a por- tion of the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum, separated from the rest by the forward growth of the corpus callosum and finally closed by the secondary union of the rostrum with the lamina terminalis. The Olfactory Lobes.—At the time when the cerebral hemispheres begin to enlarge—that is to say, at about the fourth week—a slight furrow, which appears on the ven- tral surface of each anteriorly, marks off an area which, continuing to enlarge with the hemispheres, gradually be- comes constricted off from them to form a distinct lol)e-like 38 Fig. 238.—Median Longitudinal Sec- tion OF THE Brain of an Embryo of THE Fifth Month. ac.

Furthermore, since the mucous membrane of the palate is supphed by branches from the trigeminus which pass by way of the spheno-palatine (Meckel's) ganghon, and the same region is supphed in lower forms by a palatine branch from the facial, it seems probable that the palatine Fig. 240.—Diagrams showing the Sensory Components of the Cranial Nerves of a Fish (Menidia). The somatic sensory system is unshaded, the viscero-sensory is cross- hatched, and the lateral line system is black. asc.v. Spinal root of trigeminus; brx, branchial branches of vagus; ol, olfactory bulb; op, optic nerve; rc.x, cutaneous branch of the vagus; rix, intestinal branch of vagus; rl, lateral line nerve; rl.acc, accessory lateral line nerve; ros, superficial ophthalmic; i-p, ramus palatinus of the facial; thy, hyomandibular branch of the facial; t.iiif, infra- orbital nerve.— (Herrick.) nerves of the mammalia are also to be assigned to this sys- tem.* If this be the case, a very evident clue is afforded to * The" fact that the palatine branches are associated with the tri- geminus in the Mammalia and with the facial in the Amphibia is readily explained by the fact that in the latter the Gasserian and geniculate ganglia are not always separated, so that it is possible for fibers origi- nating from the compound ganglion to pass into either nerve.

THE DESCENT OF THE TESTES. 388 testes. The change of position is partly due to the rate of growth of the inguinal ligaments being less than that of the abdominal walls, the reproductive organs being thereby drawn downward toward the inguinal regions where the ligaments are attached. The attachment is to the bottom of a slight pouch of peritoneum which projects a short dis- tance into the substance of the genital swellings and is known as the canal of Nuck in the female, and in the male as the vaginal process. In the female a second factor combines with that just mentioned. The relative shortening of the inguinal liga- ments acting alone would draw the ovaries toward the inguinal regions, but since the inguinal ligaments are united toJ.he Mii^lleriayii di^^^^ (see p. 372), and since the ovaries are continuous with the posterior layer of the peritoneal folds which contain these ducts, the fusion of the lower ends of the ducts produces a traction toward the median line, so that the ovaries come to lie finally in the true pelvis. With the testes the case is more complicated, since in addi- tion to the relative shortening of the inguinal ligaments there is an elongation of the vaginal processes into the sub- stance of the genital swellings, and it must be remembered that the testes, like the ovaries, are primarily connected with the peritoneum. Three stages may be recognized in the descent of the testes. The first of these depends on the slow rate of elongation of the inguinal ligaments or guber- naculum. It lasts until about the fifth month of develop- ment, when the testes lie in the inguinal region of the abdomen, but during this month the elongation of the guber- naculum becomes more rapid and brings about the second stage, during which there is a slight ascent of the testes, so thaFthey come to lie a little higher in the abdomen. This stage is, however, of short duration, and is succeeded by the stage of the final descent, which is characterized by th^

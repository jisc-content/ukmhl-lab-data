THE PLACENTA. becoxne very much enlarged during- pregnancy and those of the basalis communicate freely with the intervillous space, so that a free circulation of the matemal blood through the space occurs. The villi being conipletelyjiiijmersed^^ constantly renewed blood, an osmotic interchange takes place between the maternal blood of the space and the fetal blood contained in the vessels of the villi, the^maternal blood transmitting the nutritive materials necessary for the growth of_the embryo and receiving the waste products of the fetal metabolism. And it is only in this manner that the nutri- tion of the embryo can take place, since nowhere is there a direct communication of the two vascular systems. It has been maintained by many authors thaJLJlie^Lnter- villous space is lined throughout by a layer of_cells_XDntinn.ous with the endothelium of the maternal vessels, so that the fetal blood is separated from the maternal, not only by the felal tissues oFthe villi^but also by a layer of maternal ^tissue (com- pare what is said m~tlie small print on page 129 concerning the homologies of the ectodermal layers of the villi). The presence of such a layer is certainly what rnight be expected, since, as Oscar Hertwig has weTTexpressed it, "the employ- ment of spaces lying outside the blood-courses as component parts of the vascular system would be a phenomenon without analogy." It is to be noted that the arteries and veins of the decidua basalis do_iiQL-ComiTTm2icate by means of capillaries, ^"<L_lj}' the intervillous space, and~this has given rise to the" theory that the space is to be regarded as an enormously en- larged capillary, iiiwliich case it should be lined thrqnpjioiit- by maternal endotlielium~ Recent observations on the lower mammals, especially the rodents (rabbits, guinea-pig, etc.), seem to show, however, that the space owes its origin to a true effusion of maternal blood, and the evidence furnished by Peters, van Heukelom and Rossi Doria from the study of its formation in very early human embryos indicates its origin in the human placenta in the manner described above. But although It seems certain that the maternal blood con- tamed in the intervillous space is not separated bv maternal epithelium from the villi, nevertheless it is probable that in later stages the space is enclosed by epithelium. On the fet'il side It is, of course, lined by the chorionic ectoderm and on

This it does, and upon the extension so formed there is developed in each jaw a second set of thickenings, beneath each of which a dental papilla again appears. These tooth-germs represent the incisors, canines, and premolars of the permanent dentition. The lateral edges of the dental shelf being continued outward toward the articulations of the jaws as prolongations which are not Fig 16=;—Transverse Sections through the Lower Jaw showing 'the Formation of the Dental Shelf in Embryos of (^) 17 mm.

These represent the permanent molars; their formation is much later than that of the other teeth, the germ of the second molar not appearing until about the sixth week after

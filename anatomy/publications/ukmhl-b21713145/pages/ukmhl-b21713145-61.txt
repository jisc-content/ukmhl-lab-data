THE SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM. 47 upper pole of the ovum, is a mass of cells projecting into the yolk-cavity and forming what is known as the inner cell-mass, a structure comparable to the blastoderm of the reptile. In one respect, however, a difference obtains, the inner cell-mass being completely enclosed within the envel- oping cells, which is not the case with the blastoderm of the reptile. That portion of the enveloping layer which covers the cell-mass has been teniied Raube/s covering layer, and probably owes its existence to the precocity of the formation of the enveloping layer. It is clear, then, that an explanation of the early stages of development of the mammalian ovum is to be obtained by a comparison, not with a yolkless ovum such as that of Amphioxus, but with an ovum richly laden with yolk, such as the meroblastic ovum of a reptile or bird. In these forms the nutrition necessary for the growth of the embryo and for the complicated processes of development is provided for by the storing up of a quantity of yolk in the ovum, the embryo being thus independent of external sources for food. The same is true also of the lowest mammalia, the Monotremes, which are egg-laying forms, producing ova resembling greatly those of a reptile. When, however, in the higher mammals the nutrition of the embryo became provided for by the attachment of the embryo to the walls of the uterus of the parent so that it could be nourished directly by the parent, the storing, up of yolk in the ovum was unnecessary and it became a holoblastic ovum, although many peculiarities dependent on the original meroblastic condition persisted in its development. Twin Development.â€”As a rule, in the human species but one embryo develops at a time, but the occurrence of twins is by no means infrequent, and triplets and even quadruplets occa- sionally are developed. The occurrence of twins may be due to two causes, either to the simultaneous ripening and fertiliza- tion of two ova, either from one or from both ovaries, or to the

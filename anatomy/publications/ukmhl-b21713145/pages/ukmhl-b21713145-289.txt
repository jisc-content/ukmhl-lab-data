DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. These are represented iii^tlie belly-stalk by a single venous trmik which, when it reaches the body of the embryo, divides J^nto two stems which pass forward, one on each side of the^umbilicus, and thence on each side of the median line of the ventral abdominal wall, to form with the corre- sponding omphalo-mesenteric veins common trunks which open into the ductus Cuvieri. As the liver develops it comes into intimate relation with the omphalo-mesenteric veins, which receive numerous branches from its substance and, indeed, seem to break up into a network (Fig. 153, A) Fig. 153.—Diagrams Illustrating the Transformations of the Omphalomesenteric and Umbilical Veins. £>.C, Ductus Cuvieri; D.V.A, ductus venosus; V.o.m.d and V.o.m.s, right and left omphalo-mesenteric veins; V.u.d and V.u.s right ^nd left umbilical \ems.— (Hochstetter.) ' traversing the liver substance and uniting again to form two stems which represent the original continuations of the omphalo-mesenterics. From the point where the common trunk formed by the right omphalo-mesenteric and umbili- cal veins opens into the Cuvierian duct a new vein develops, passing downward and to the left to unite with the left

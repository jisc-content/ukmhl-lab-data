POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. 5o8 and twelfth years, followed by (2) a rapid acceleration which reaches its maximum at about the sixteenth year and then very rapidly diminishes. These irregularities may be more clearly seen from the charts on page 507, which rep- resent the curves obtained by plotting the annual increase of weight in boys (Chart I) and girls (Chart II). The diminution and acceleration of growth referred to above are clearly observable, and it is interesting to note that they occur at earlier periods in girls than in boys, the diminution occurring in girls at the eighth and ninth years and the acceleration reaching its maximum at the thirteenth year. Considering, now, merely the general diminution in the rate of growth which occurs from birth to adult-life, it becomes interesting to note to what extent the organs which are more immediately associated with the metabolic activi- ties of the body undergo a relative reduction in weight. The most important of these organs is undoubtedly the liver, but with it there must also be considered the thyreoid and thymus glands, and probably the suprarenal bodies. In all these organs there is a marked diminution in size as com- pared with the weight of the body, as will be seen from the following table (H. Vierordt), which also includes data ABSOLUTE WEIGHT IN GRAMS. New-born and Adult. Liver. Thy- reoid. Ihy- mus. Suprarenal Bodies. Spleen. Heart. Kid- ney.

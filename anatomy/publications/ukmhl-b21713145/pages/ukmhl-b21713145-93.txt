79 DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. and the next to be described than is implied by the figures. This embryo (Fig. 45) is also one of those described by His and is known as embryo lxvii (Lr). It measures 4.2 mm. in length and shows an almost complete disappearance of the dorsal flexure so marked in embryo Lxviii. Instead of this, it presents a well-marked ventral bending of lx)th the anterior and posterior portions of the body, so that the dorsal surface is prominently curved in the regions which will later be the nape of the neck and the sacral region, and consequently the convexities may be known as the neck bend and the sacral bend. Furthermore, there is noticeable a ventral projection of the extreme front end of the body, so that a third convexity occurs anterior to the neck bend and may be termed the head bend. The constriction of the yolk-sac has progressed; the meso- dermic somites have almost reached their maximum devel- opment and are very distinct; the two branchial clefts pres- ent in the preceding embryo have increased in size and the third cleft has made its appearance; two small elevations of the sides of the body, one almost opposite the neck bend and the other opposite the sacral bend, are the first indica- tions of the limbs (Ul and LI) ; and the eyeball and ear vesicle (au), which were present though not very evident ni earlier stages, are now plainly visible in surface views. In the next stage—as a type of which an embryo figured by Coste (Fig. 46) may be taken—the three bends of the body mentioned alx)ve have greatly increased, so that the head and tail of the embryo are almost in contact and the latter is bent a little toward one side. The closure of the * ventral surface of the body is almost completed and the margins of the umbilicus have begun to be prolonged ven- trally so as to enclose the yolk-stalk and belly-stalk in the umbilical cord.

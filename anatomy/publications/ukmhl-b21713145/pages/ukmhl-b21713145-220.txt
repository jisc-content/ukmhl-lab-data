2o6 DEVELOPMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLES. more or less regularly in rows and later jrnigrating from y- their ojginal centrajjposition to the perijjher^fjjie^lw^^ and, in the limb muscles, the development is further compli- cated by a process of degeneration which affects groups of muscle fibers, so that bundles of normal fibers are separated by strands of degenerated tissue in which the fibrils have disappeared, the nuclei have become pale and the sarcoplasm vacuolated and homogeneous. Later the degenerated tissue seems to disappear entirely and mesenchymatous connective tissue grows in between the persisting fibers, grouping them into bundles and the bundles into the individual muscles. So long as the formation of new fibrils continues, the increase in the thickness of a muscle is probably due to a certain extent to an increase in the actual number of fibers, which results from the division of those already exist- ing. Subsequently, however, this mode of growth ceases, the further increase of the muscle depending upon an in- crease in size of its constituent elements (Macallum). The Development of the Skeletal Muscles.â€”It has already been pointed out that all the skeletal muscles of the body, with the exception of those connected with the bran- chial arches, are derived from the myotomes of the meso- dermic somites, even the limb muscles possibly having such an origin, although the cells of the tissue from which the muscles of the limb buds form lack an epithelial arrange- ment and are indistinguishable from the somatic mesen- chyme which forms the axial cores of the limbs. The various fibers of each myotome are at first loosely arranged, but later they become more compact and are arranged parallel with one another, their long axes being directed antero-posteriorly. This stage is also transitory, / however, the fibers of each myotome undergoing various modifications to produce the conditions existing in the adult, in which the original segmental arrangement of the fibers

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKIN. cutaneous branches of the fourth thoracic nerve, as determined expenmentally in the monkey (Macacus), is distinctly zonal or segmental, the nipple lying practically in the middle line of the zone, the upper half of its area is also supplied or over- lapped by fibers of the third nerve and the lower half by fibers of the fifth (Fig. 80), so that j^ny area of_skiiLin the zone is innervated by fibers coming from at least two segmental nerves (ISherrington). And, furthermore, the distribution of each nerve crosses the mid-ventral line of the body, forming a more or less extensive crossed overlap. And not only is there a confusion of adjacent areas but an area may shift its position relatively to the deeper structures Fig. 80.—Diagram showing the Overlap of the ///, IV, and V In- tercostal Nerves of a Monkey.—(Sherrington.) supplied by the same nerve, so that the skin over a certain muscle is not necessarily supplied by fibers from the nerve which supplies the muscle. Thus, in the lower half of the abdomen, the skin at any point will be supplied by fibers from higher nerves than those supplying the underlying muscles (Sherrington), and the skin of the limbs may receive twigs from nerves which are not represented at all in the muscle- supply (second and third thoracic and third sacral). The Development of the Nails.—The earliest indica- tions of the development of the nails have been described by Zander in embryos of about nine weeks as slight thicken- ings of the epidermis of the tips of the digits, these thick- enings being separated from the neighboring tissue by a faint groove. Later the nail areas migrate to the dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges (Fig. 81) and the grooves

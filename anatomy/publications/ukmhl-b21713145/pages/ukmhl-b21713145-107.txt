93 AGE OF EMBRVO AT DIFFERENT STAGES. Thus, Bischoff found that the embryonic disk in the rabbit showed but httle differentiation up to the seventh or eighth day, while at the tenth day the embryo possessed branchial clefts and mesodermic somites. It would seem from the available data, which are more definite than usual, that a human embryo described by Eternod and measuring only 1.3 mm. in length was very nearly tw^enty-one days old; and if this estimate be correct then the ages assignied by His to the earlier embryos must be very considerably increased. As regards the later periods of dev^elopment, the limits of error for any date become of less importance. His esti- mates that at the end of the second month when the embryo Ijecomes a fetus, its length is about 25 to 28 mm., and for later periods Schroder gives the following- measurements as the averag-e: 3d lunar month 70- 90 mm. 100-170 mm. 180-270 mm. 280-340 mm. 350-380 mm. 425 mm. 467 mm. 490-500 mm. 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th loth From the study of a relatively large number of embryos Mall concludes that the ages of embryos measuring any- where from I to 100 mm. in length may be expressed in days with a fair amount of accuracy by the square root of the length multiplied by 100 (VnengFirin~^nrnO<~ioo), and that in embryos between 100 and 220 mm. the age in days is about the same as the length in millimeters. The data concerning the weight of embryos of different ages are as yet very insufficient, and it is well known that the weights of new-born children may vary greatly, the authenticated extremes being, according to Vierordt,' 717 grams and 6123 grams. It is probable that considerable

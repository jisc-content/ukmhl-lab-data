DEVELOPMENT OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. Opening of the sac into the veins being guarded by a valve due to the obHque direction taken by the outgrowth. From each lymph heart branches, whjch anastomose and radiate in all directions, grow outward toward the skin, which they reach in embryos of about i8 mm., and in later stages con- tinue, to extend in a radiating manner until they form a sub- cutaneous network over the anterior half of the body. In the meantime the lymph hearts have separated from their points of origin (Fig. 158, A, ALH), with which, however, they remain connected by a duct, and from this a branch grows backward, following the line of the vagus nerve (Fig. 158, A, TD). The branch on the left side soon meets with the aorta and, using this as a guide, grows more rapidly than its fellow on the right and becomes the thoracic duct, or, rather, since it divides just before it reaches the aorta and sends a branch backward on either side of that vessel, it gives rise to tzvo thoracic ducts (Fig. 158, B). In embryos of 20 mm. a second pair of lymph hearts de- velops at the junction of the sciatic veins with the cardinals (Fig. 158, A, PLH), and from these branches grow toward the surface and radiate subcutaneously, similarly to those from the anterior hearts, with which they eventually unite. The thoracic ducts, continuing to elongate backward, dilate opposite the kidneys to form two receptacula chyli (Fig. 158, B, RC) and still more posteriorly unite with the pos- terior lymph hearts, which then separate completely from the veins from which they originated. In later stages branches, arising as outgrowths from^the thoracic ducts, gradually invade the mesentery and the various organs, following in general the course of the arteries, as do also the branches which pass to the limbs to form their deep lymphatics; the superficial branches, on the contrary, follow essentially the course of the veins. The lymph hearts as deyelopnient proceeds become transformed

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRA AND RIBS. 173 but a single center appears in the body. Thus, to take a thoracic vertebra as a type, a center appears in each half of each vertebral arch at the base of the transverse process and gradually extends to form the bony lamina, pedicle, and the greater portion of the transverse and spinous processes; a single center gives rise to the body of the vertebra; and each rib ossifies from a single center. These various cen- ters appear early in embryonic life, but the complete trans- formation of the cartilages into bone does not occur until Fig. 96.—a, a Vertebra at Birth; B, Lumbar Vertebra showing Secondary Centers of Ossification. a, Center for the articular process; c, body; el, lower epiphysial plate; en, upper epiphysial plate; na, vertebral arch; s, center for spinous process; t, center for transverse process.— (Sappey.) some time after birth, each vertebra at that period consist- ing of three parts, a body and two halves of an arch, sepa- rated by unossified cartilage (Fig. 96, A). At about puberty secondary centers make their appearance; one ap- pears in the cartilage which still covers the anterior and posterior surfaces of the vertebral body, producing disks of bone in these situations, another appears at the tip of each spinous and transverse process (Fig. 96, B), and in the lumbar vertebrae others appear at the tips of the articu- lating processes. The epiphyses so formed remain separate until growth is completed and between the sixteenth and twenty-fifth years unite with the bones formed from the primary centers, which have fused by this time, to form a single vertebra.

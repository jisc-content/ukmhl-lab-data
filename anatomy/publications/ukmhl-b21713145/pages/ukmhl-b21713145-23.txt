INTRODUCTION. 9 may be supposed that this has been the case ah initio. This is the doctrine of the continuity of the germ-plasm, a doc- trine of fundamental importance on account of its bearings on the phenomena of heredity. It is necessary, however, to fix upon some hnk in the continuous chain of the germ-plasm as the starting-point of the development of each individual, and this link is the fertilized ovum. By this is meant a germ cell produced by the fusion of two units of the germ-plasm. In many of the lower forms of life {e. g., Hydra and certain turbel- larian worms) reproduction may be accomplished by a di- vision of the entire organism into two parts or by the separation of a portion of the body from the parent indi- vidual. Such a method of reproduction is termed non- sexual. Furthermore in a number of forms {e. g., bees. Phylloxera, water-fleas) the germ cells are able to undergo development without previously being fertilized, this consti- tuting a method of reproduction known as parthenogenesis. But in all these cases sexual reproduction also occurs, and in all the more highly organized animals it is the only method which normally occurs; in it a germ cell develops only after complete fusion with another germ cell. In the simpler forms of this process little difference exists between the two combining cells, but since it is, as a rule, of advan- tage that a certain amount of nutrition should be stored up in the germ cells for the support of the developing em- bryo until it is able to secure food for itself, while at the same time it is also advantageous that the cells which unite shall come from different individuals (cross-fertilization), and hence that the cells should retain their motility, a di- vision of labor has resulted. Certain germ cells store up more or less food yolk, their motility becoming thereby im- paired, and form what are termed the female cells or ova, while others discard all pretensions of storing up nutrition.

The first of these is at first indistinguishable from the pyloric portion of the stomach and can be recognized as the duodenum only by the fact that it Jias connected with it the ducts of the liver and pancreas; as development proceeds, however, its caliber diminishes and it assumes the appear- ance of a portion of the intestine. The remaining coils elongate rapidly and are thrown into Fig. 177.—Reconstruction of the Intestine of an Embryo of ly mm.

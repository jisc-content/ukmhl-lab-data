1^52 OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. separated from one another by bands of cartilage. The portion of cartilage lying in front of the foramen magnum ossifies to form a basioccipital bone (Fig. 103, bo), the por- tions on either side of this give rise to the two exoccipitals {co), which bear the condyles, and the portion above the foramen produces a supraoccipital {so), which represents ho, Basioccipital; eo, exoccipital; ip, praoccipital, although even interparietal; so, supraoccipital. . . . ... - ri line of union of the two parts is to be seen in two deep in- cisions at the sides of the bone. The union of the exoc- cipitals and supraoccipital takes place in the course of the first or second year after birth, but the basioccipital does not fuse with the rest of the bone until the sixth or eighth year. It will be noticed that no special centers occur for the four occipital vertebrje, these structures having become completely incorporated in the chondrocranium, and even the cartilaginous partitions which divide the hypoglossal foram- ina usually disappear during the process of ossification.

All that por- tion of the bone which lies above that line is com- posed of membrane bone which owes its origin to the fusion of two or some- times four centers of ossi- fication, appearing in the membranous roof of the embryonic skull. The bone so formed {ip) represents the interparietal of lower vertebrates and, at an early stage, unites with the su- at birth an indication of the

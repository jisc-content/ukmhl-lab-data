THE LARYNX/ corresponding prolongations of the plates of the opposite side, so as to enclose an area of mesenchyme into.which the chondrification only extends at a later period, and occasion- ally fails to so extend, producing what is termed a foramen thyreoideum. The mesenchymal condensations which represent the cri- coid and arytenoid cartilages are continuous, but each aryte- noid has a distinct center of chondrification, while the car- tilage of the cricoid appears as a single ring which is at first open dorsally and only later becomes complete. The epi- glottis cartilage resembles the thyreoid in being formed by the fusion of two originally distinct cartilages, from each of which a portion separates to form the cuneiform cartilages {cartilages of Wrisherg), while the corniculate cartilages {cartilages of Sautorini) are formed by the separation of a small portion of cartilage from each arytenoid. The formation of the thyreoid cartilage by the fusion of two pairs of lateral elements finds an explanation from the study of the comparative anatomy of the larynx. In the lowest group of the mammalia, the Monotremata, the four cartilages do not fuse together and are very evidently serially homologous with the cartilages which form the cornua of the hyoid. In other words, the thyreoid results from the fusion of the fourth and fifth branchial cartilages. The cricoid, in its development, presents such striking similari- ties to the cartilaginous rings of the trachea that it is prob- ably to be regarded as the uppermost cartilage of that series, but the epiglottis seems to be a secondary chondrification in the glosso-laryngeal fold (Schaffer). The arytenoids pos- sibly represent an additional pair of branchial cartilages, such as occur in the lower vertebrates (Gegenbaur). These last arches have undergone almost complete re- duction in the mammalia, the cartilages being their only representatives, but, in addition to the cartilages, the fourth

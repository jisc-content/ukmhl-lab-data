3^4 THE MESONEPHROS. ber of coiled tubules, which arise by some of the cells of the ridge aggregating to form solid cords, at first entirely unconnected with either the coelomic epithelium or the Wolffian duct. Later the cords become connected with the coelomic epithelium and acquire a lumen, and near the coelomic end of the tubule a condensation of the mesen- chyme of the Wolffian ridge occurs to form a glomerulus into which a branch ex- tends from the neighbor- ing aorta. The tubules finally acquire connection with the Wolffian duct and at the same time lose their connections with the coelomic epithelium, their nephrostomes being ac- cordingly but transitory structures. The tubules rapidly increase in length and become coiled, and the glomeruli project into their cavities, pushing in front of them the wall of the tubule so that it has the appearance represented in Fig 202. It seems probable that primarily the mesonephric cords are arranged segmentally, a single pair occurring in each segment of the body behind the pronephros as far back, probably, as the pelvic region, and hence the intermediate cell-mass from which the Wolffian ridge is formed may properly be regarded as composed of nephrotomes, even though no surface indications of segmentation are to be seen in it. The correspondence of the tubules with the myotomes becomes, however, early disturbed, partly as the Fig. 202.—Transverse Section of THE Wolffian Ridge of a Chick Embryo of Three Days. ao, Aorta; gl, glomerulus; gr, genital ridge; mes, mesentery; mt, meso- nephric tubule; vc, cardinal vein; Wd, Wolffian duct.—(Mihalkovicz.)

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 261 the vesical, inferior hiemorrhoidal and uterine, which are distributed to the pelvic viscera. At birth the portions of the umbiHcal arteries beyond the umbiHcus are severed when the umbilical cord is cut, and their intra-embryonic portions, which have been called the hypogastric arteries, quickly undergo a reduction in size. Their proximal portions re- main functional as the superior vesical arteries, carrying blood to the urinary bladder, but the portions which intervene between the bladder and the umbilicus become re- duced to solid cords, forming the obliterated hypogastric arteries of • adult anatomy. In its general plan, accordingly, the arterial system may be regarded as consisting of a pair of longitudinal vessels which fuse together throughout the greater portion of their length to form the dorsal aorta, from which there arise segmentally arranged lateral somatic branches and ventral and lateral visceral branches. With the exception of the aortic trunks (together with their anterior continuations, the internal carotids) and the external carotids, no longitudinal arteries exist primarily. In the adult, however, several longitudinal vessels, such as the vertebrals, internal mam- mary, and epigastric arteries, exist.

THE NOTOCHORD. lOI and these cells later undergo a peculiar transformation whereby the chordal tube is converted into a solid elastic rod surrounded by a cuticular sheath secreted by the cells. The notochord lies at first immediately beneath the median line of the medullary groove, between the ectoderm and the endoderm, and has on either side of it the mesodermal plates. It is a temporary structure of which only rudiments persist in the adult condition in man, but it is a structure characteristic of all vertebrate embryos and persists to a more or less perfect extent in many of the fishes, being indeed the only axial skeleton possessed by Amphioxus. Li^ the higher vertebrates it is almost completely replaced by the vertebral column, which develops around it in a manner to be described later. Turning now to the middle germinal layer, it will be found that in it also important changes take place during these early stages of development. The probable mode of devel- opment of the extmrembryonic mesoderm and body-cavity has already been described (p. 69) and attention may now be directed toward what occurs in the embryonic mesoderm. In both the Peters embryo and the embryo v.H described by von Spee this portion of the mesoderm is represented by a_2late_.of^ls lying, between the ectoderm and endoderni^ and becoming continuous at the edges of the embryonic area with both the laver whirh â– ^iirr^^^^^j'. tiie yolk-sac and, through the mesoderm of the belly-stalk, with the chorionic mesoderm (Fig. 35). It seems probable, since there is in these embryos no indication as yet of the formation of the chorda endoderm, that this plate of mesoderm corresponds to the prostomial mesoderm of lower forms. In older em- bryos, such as the embryo Gle of Graf Spee and the younger embryo described by Eternod (Fig. 54), the mesoderip'^no longer forms a continuous sheet extending completely across the embryonic disk, but is divided into two lateral plates, in

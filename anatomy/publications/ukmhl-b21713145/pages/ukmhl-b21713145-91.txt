DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. 77 for a time and then either disappear or are applied to some entirely different purpose. Indeed, in man they are never really clefts but merely grooves, and corresponding to each groove in the ectoderm there is also one in the subjacent endoderm of what will eventually be the pharyngeal region of the digestive tract, so that in the region of each cleft the ectoderm and endoderm are in close relation, being sepa- rated only by a very thin layer of mesoderm, while in the intervals between suc- cessive clefts a more con- siderable amount of meso- derm is present (Fig. 44). In the human embryo four clefts develop on each side of the body and five branchial arches, the last arch lying posteriorly to the fourth cleft and not being very sharply defined along its posterior margin. As just stated, the clefts are normally merely grooves, and in later development either disappear or are converted into special structures. Occasionally, however, a cleft may persist and the thin membrane which forms its floor may become per- forated so that an opening from the exterior into the pharynx occurs at the side of the neck, forming what is termed a branchial fistula. Such an abnormality is most frequently de- veloped from The lower (ventral) part of the first cleft; nor- mally this disappears, the upper portion persisting, however, to form the external auditory meatus and tympanic cavity. The embryo lxviii (Lg) just described measured 2.11 mm. in length, this measurement, however, being taken along a straight line and not following the flexure of the body. It does not, therefore, represent the actual length of the body and there is much less difference between this Fig. 44.~-Floor of the Pharynx OF Embryo B, 7 mm. Long.

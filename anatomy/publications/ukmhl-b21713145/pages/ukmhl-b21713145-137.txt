THE UMBILICAL CORD. 123 nion passes up upon the sides of the belly-stalk (Fig. 63, B), so that the whole of the ventral surface of the stalk is entirely uncovered by ectoderm, this layer being limited to its dorsal surface (Fig. 64). In subsequent stages the embryonic ectoderm and somatic mesoderm at the edges of the umbilicus grow out ventrally, carrying with them the line of attachment of the amnion and forming a tube which encloses the proximal part of the yolk-stalk. The ectoderm of the belly-stalk at the same time extending more laterally, the condition represented in Fig. 63, C, is pro- duced, and, these processes continuing, the entire belly- stalk, together with the yolk-stalk, becomes enclosed within a cylindrical cord extending from the ventral surface of the body to the chorion and forming the iijnbilical cord (Fig. 63, D). From this mode of development it is evident that the cord is, strictly speaking, a portion of the embryo, its sur- faces being completely cQvered by embryonk-ectodexni^ the amnion being carried during its formation further and further from the umbilicus until finally it is attached around the, distal extremity of the cord. In_enclosing the yolk-stalk the umbilical cord,, encloses. also a small portion of what was originally the extra- embryonic body-cayit)^_sur^ the yolk-stalk. A sec- tion of the cord in an early stage of its development (Fig. 65, A) will show a thick mass of mesoderm occupying its dorsal region; this represents the mesoderm of the belly- stalk and contains the allantois and the umbilical arteries and vein (the two veins originally present in the belly-stalk having fused), while toward the ventral surface there will be seen a distinct cavity in which lies the yolk-stalk with its accompanying blood-vessels. The portion of this coelom nearest the body of the embryo becomes much enlarged, and during the second month of development contains some coils

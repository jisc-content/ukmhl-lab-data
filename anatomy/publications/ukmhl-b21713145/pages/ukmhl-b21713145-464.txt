THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. 450 they branch, one of tlie branches continuing ventrally in the body-wall, while the other (Fig. 243, wr) passes mesially toward the aorta, some of its fibers reaching that structure, while others bend so as to assume a longitudinal direction. These mesial branches represent the white rami communicantes, but as yet no ganglion cells can be seen in Fig. 243.—Transverse Section through the Spinal Cord of an Em- bryo OF 7 MM. c, Notochord; g, posterior root ganglion; ni, spinal cord; s, sympathetic cell migrating from the posterior root ganglion; zvr, white ramus.— (His.) their course. The cells of the posterior root ganglia have already, for the most part, assumed their bipolar form, but among them there may still be found a number of cells in the neuroblast condition, and these (Fig. 243, s), wander- ing out from the ganglia, give rise to a column of cells

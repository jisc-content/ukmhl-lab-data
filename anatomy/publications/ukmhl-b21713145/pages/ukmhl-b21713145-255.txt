THE FORMATION OF THE HEART. 241 into leukocytes; that the polymorphonuclear and polynuclear leukocytes are not stages leading to disintegration, but repre- sent stages of amitotic division, etc. It is impossible in the limits of the present work to discuss these various ideas, and the views which have seemed to be most strongly supported by observations have been chosen for presentation.

The Formation of the Heart.—The heart makes its ap- pearance while the embryo is still spread out upon the surface of the yolk-sac, and arises as two_sepa.rate portions which only later come into contact in the median line. On each side of the body near the margins of the embry- onic areata fold of the splanchnopleure'^appears, projecting into jdie^coelomic_xa.Yity, and within this fold a v^ery tlim- walled sac is formed, probably by a splitting of¥ of its in- nermost cells (Fig. 130, A). Eadhjold will produce a portion of the muscular walls {myocardiuiit) of the heart, and each sac j3art„.Q.Lits_eiidotlieliu (endocardmm). tRe constriction of the embryo from the yolk-sac proceeds, the two folds are gradually brought nearer,together (Fig. 130, B), until they meet in the mid-ventral line, when the myocardial folds and endocardial sac fuse together (Fig. •22

THE TRUNK MUSCULATURE. 214 in the human body, although traces of still more posterior myotomes are to be found in muscles such as the curvator coccygis sometimes developed in connection with the coccy- geal vertebrae. The perineal muscles and the external sphincter ani are also developments of the third and fourth (and second) sacral myotomes. At a time when the cloaca (see p. 297) is still present, a sheet of muscles lying close beneath the integument forms a sphincter around its opening (Fig. ti6). sr P A B Fig. 116.—Perineal Region of Embryos of {A') Two Months and (5) Four to Five Months^ showing the Development of the Perineal Muscles. dc, Nervus dorsalis clitoridis; p, pudendal nerve; sa, sphincter ani; sc, sphincter cloacae; sv, sphincter vaginjE.— {Popozvsky.) On the development of the partition which divides the cloaca into rectal and urinogenital portions, the sphincter is also divided, its more posterior portion persisting as the external sphincter ani, while the anterior part gradually differentiates into the various perineal muscles (Popowsky). The Cranial Musculature.—As was pointed out in an earlier chapter, the existence of distinct mesodermic somites has not yet been completely demonstrated in the head of the human emhryo,but in lower forms, such as the elasmohranch fishes, they are clearly distinguishable, and it may be sup-

429 THE CEREBRAL CONVOLUTIONS. V the entire thickness of the pallial wall and consequently pro- duces an elevation upon the inner surface, a projection into the cavity of the ventricle which is known as the hippocam- pus, whence the fissure may be termed the hippocampal fis- sure. The portion of the pallium which intervenes between this fissure and the chorioidal forms what is known as the dentate gyrus. Toward the end of the third or the beginning- of the fourth month two prolonga- tions arise from the fissure just where it turns to be continued into the temporal lobe, and these, extending posteriorly, give rise to the parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures. Like the hippocampal, these fissures produce elevations upon the in- ner surface of the pal- lium, that formed by the parieto-occipital early disappearing, while that produced by the calcarine persists to form the calcar {hippocampus minor) of adult anatomy. The three fissures just described, together with the chorioidal and the lateral cerebral fossa, are all formed by the beginning of the fourth month and all affect the entire thickness of the wall of the hemisphere, and hence have been termed the primary or total fissures. Until the begin- ning of the fifth month they are the only fissures present, but at that time secondary fissures, which, with one excep- tion, are merely furrows of the surface of the pallium, Fig. 235.â€”Bbain of an Embryo of the Fourth Month. c, Cerebellum; p, pons, s, lateral cere- bra fossa.

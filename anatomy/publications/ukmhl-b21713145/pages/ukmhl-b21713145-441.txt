Later, however, the walls of the hemispheres gain the ascendancy in rapidity of growth and the plexuses become relatively much smaller. Since the portions of the roof-plate which form the chorioidal fissures are continuous with the velum interpositum in the roofs of the interventricular foramina, the chorioid plexuses of the lateral and third ventricles be- come continuous also at that point. The mode of growth of the chorioid fissures seems to indicate the mode of growth of the hemispheres. At first the growth is more or less equal in all directions, but later it be- comes more extensive posteriorly, there being more room for ex- pansion in that direction, and when further extension backward becomes difficult the posterior ex- tremities of the hemispheres bend ventrally toward the base of the cranium, and reaching this, turn forward to form the temporal lobes. As a result the cavities of the hemispheres, the lateral ven- tricles, in addition to being carried forward to form an anterior horn, are also carried backward and ventrally to form the lateral or descending horn, and the corpus striatum likewise extends backward to the tip of each tem- poral lobe as a slender process known as the tail of the caudate nucleus. In addition to the anterior and lateral horns, the ventricles of the human brain also possess Fig. 234.—Median Longi- tudinal Section of the Brain of an Embryo Calf of 5 cm. ch, Cerebellum; cp, chorioid plexus; cs, corpus stria- tum; fM, interventricular foramen ; in, hypophysis ; m, mid-brain; oc, optic commissure; t, posterior part of the diencephalon. — {Mihalkovicz.)

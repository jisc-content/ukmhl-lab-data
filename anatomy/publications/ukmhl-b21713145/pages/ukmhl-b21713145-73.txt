FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 59 around the inner surface of the enveloping layer. A little later a dark area appears at one end of the embryonic disk, produced by a proliferation of cells in this region and having a somewhat crescentic form. As the embryonic disk in- creases in size a longitudinal band makes its appearance, extending forward in the median line nearly to the center of the disk, and represents the primitive streak (Fig. 29, B), a slight groove along its median line forming what is termed the primitive groove. In slightly later stages an especially dark spot may be seen at the front end of the primitive streak and is termed Hensens node (Fig. 29, C, hn), while Fig. 30.—Posterior Portion of a Longitudinal Section through THE Embryonic Disk of a Mole. bl, Blastopore, ec, ectoderm; en, endoderm; prnij prostomial meso- derm.— (After Heape.) still later a dark streak may be observed extending forward from this in the median line and is termed the head-process of the primitive streak. To understand the meaning of these various dark areas recourse must be had to the study of sections. A longi- tudinal section through the embryonic disk of a mole ovum at the time when the crescentic area makes its appearance is shown in Fig. 30. Here there is to be seen near the hinder edge of the disk what is potentially an opening (bl), in front of which the ectoderm (ec) and primary endodenn (en) can be clearly distinguished, while behind it no such distinction of the two layers is visible.' This stage may be regarded as comparable to a stage immediately preceding the invagination stage of the reptilian ovum, and the region

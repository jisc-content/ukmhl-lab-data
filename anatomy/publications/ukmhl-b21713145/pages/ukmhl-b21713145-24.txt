INTRODUCTION. lO are especially motile and can seek and penetrate the inert ova; these latter cells constitute the male cells or sperma- tozoa. In many animals both kinds of cells are produced by the same individual, but in all the vertebrates (with rare exceptions in some of the lower orders) each individual produces only ova or spermatozoa, or, as it is generally stated, the sexes are distinct. It is of importance, then, that the peculiarities of the two forms of germ cells, as they occur in the human species, should be considered. LITERATURE. E. B.

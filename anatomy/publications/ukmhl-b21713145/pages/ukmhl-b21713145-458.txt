In the first place, the neuroblasts which give rise to those fibers of the nerve which come from the spinal cord are situated in the dorsal part of the ventral zones and in the adult in the lateral horn of the cord. As the nuclei of origin are traced anteriorly they will be found to change their position somewhat as the medulla is reached and eventually come to lie in the reticular formation, the most anterior of them being practically continuous with the motor nucleus of the vagus. Indeed, it seems that the spinal accessory nerve is properly to be regarded as an ex- tension of the vagus downward into the cervical region (Fiirbringer, Streeter), a process which reaches its greatest development in the mammalia and seems to stand in relation to the development of those portions of the trapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles which are supplied by the spinal accessory nerve. It is believed that the white rami communicantes which pass from the spinal cord to the thoracic and upper lumbar sympathetic ganglia arise from cells situated in the dorso- lateral portions of the ventral horns, and it is noteworthy that white rami are wanting in the region in which the spinal

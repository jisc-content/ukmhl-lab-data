279 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. rounded by a venous ring, the dorsal limb of which is formed by the new longitudinal anastomosis, which has been termed the supracardinal vein (McClure and Hunt- ington), while the ventral limb is formed by a portion of the posterior cardinal (Fig. 155, B). Still later the ven- tral limb of the loop disappears and the dorsal supracardinal limb replaces a portion of the more primitive posterior car- dinal. An anastomosis now develops between the right and left cardinals at the point where the iliac veins open into them (Fig. 155, B), and the portion of the left cardinal which intervenes between this anastomosis and the entrance of the internal spermatic vein disappears, the remainder of it, as far forward as the renal vein, persisting as the upper part of the left internal spermatic vein, which thus comes to open into the renal vein instead of into the vena cava, as does the corresponding vein of the right side of the bod}'- (Fig. 155, C, s). The renal veins originally open into the cardinals at the point where these are joined by the large cross-connection, and when the lower part of the left car- dinal disappears, this cross-connection forms the proximal part of the left renal vein, which consequently receives the left suprarenal (Fig. 155, C). The observations upon which the above description is based have been made upon the rabbit, but it seems jrnb- ablejrom the partial observations that have been made that similar changes occur also in the human embrvo. It will be noted from what has been said that the inferior yena cava is a composite vessel, consisting^ of at least four ele- ments: (i) the proximal part of the ductus venosus; (2) the anterior part of the right subcardinal; (3) the right supracardina]j_and (4) the posterior part of the right cardinal. Recent observations by McClure and Huntington on the development of the veins of the cat show, however, that

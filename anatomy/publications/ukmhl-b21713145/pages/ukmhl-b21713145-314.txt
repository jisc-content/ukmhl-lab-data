300 DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOUTH REGION. maxillge, thus completing the separation of the definitive mouth from the nasal cavity. At the point" o"f meeting of the shelves with the premaxillas a small communication be- tween the two cavities persists for a time, frequently until after birth; it allows passage of the anterior palatine vessels and nerves, and places the organ of Jacobson (p. 459) in communication with the mouth. Later the opening becomes closed over by mucous membrane, but it may be recognized Fig. 164.—View of the Roof of the Oral Fossa of Embryo showing THE Lip-groove and the Formation of the Palate.—(His.) in the dried skull as the foramen incisivum (anterior pala- tine canal). When the ridges which become the palatal plates are first formed they have an almost vertical direction, projecting down- ward and somewhat inward between the sides of the tongue and the alveolar processes. The tongue at this stage almost completely fills the oral cavity, its dorsum being in contact with the base of the skull. Later, the lower jaw, which at first is considerably shorter than the upper one, increases in length and at the same time also in breadth, and also assumes a more horizontal position. The tongue then sinks down between the Meckelian cartilages and the palatal ridges bend dorsally so as to become horizontal, and their further growth leads to their union in the median line to form the roof of the mouth. Occasionally there is a failure of the union of the palatal plates, the condition known as cleft palate resulting. The in-

DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. to reach its requisite diameter and strength, without becom- ing an almost soHd and unwieldy mass of compact bone. During the ossification of the cartilaginous trabeculse osteoblasts become enclosed by the bony substance, the cavi- ties in which they lie forming the lacunce and processes radiating out from them, the canaliculi, so characteristic of bone tissue. In the growth of periosteal bone not only do osteoblasts become enclosed, but blood-vessels also, the Haversian canals being formed in this way, and around Fig. 92.—A, Transverse Section of the Femur of a Pig Killed AFTER Having Been Fed with Madder for Four Weeks; B, the Same of a Pig Killed Two Months after the Cessation of the Madder Feeding. The heavy black Hue represents the portion of bone stained by the madder.—{After Flourens.) these lamellae of bone are deposited by the enclosed osteo- blasts to form Haversian systems. That the absorption of periosteal bone takes place during growth can be demonstrated by taking advantage of the fact that the coloring substance madder, when consumed with food, tinges the bone being formed at the time a distinct red. In pigs fed with madder for a time and then killed a section of the femur shows a superficial band of red bone (Fig. 92, A), but if the animals be allowed to live for one or two months after the cessation of the madder feeding, the red band will be found to be covered by a layer of white bone varying in thick- ness according to the interval elapsed since the cessation of feeding (Fig. 92, B) ; and if this interval amount to four months, it will be found that the thickness of the uncolored

164 DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. mesenchyme, until finally the cartilage becomes entirely con- verted into a mass of spongy bone enclosed within a layer of more compact periosteal bone. As a rule, each cartilage bone is developed from a single center of ossification, and when it is found that a bone of the skull, for instance, develops by several centers, it is to be regarded as formed by the fusion of several primarily distinct bones, a conclusion which may generally be con- firmed by a comparison of the bone in question with its homologues in the lower vertebrates. Exceptions to this rule occur in bones situated in the median line of the body, these occasionally developing from two centers lying one on either side of the median line, but such centers are usually to be regarded as a double center rather than as two distinct centers, and are merely an expression of the fundamental bilaterality which exists even in median structures. More striking exceptions are to be found in the long bones in which one or both extremities develop from special centers which give rise to the epiphyses (Fig. 91, ep, ep'), the shaft or diaphysis (d) being formed from the primary center. Similar secondary centers appear in marked promi- nences on bones to which powerful muscles are attached (Fig. 91, a and Z?), but these, as well as the epiphysial cen- ters, can readily be recognized as secondary from the fact that they do not appear until much later than the primary centers of the bones to which they belong. These secondary centers give the necessary firmness required for articular surfaces and for the attachment of muscles and, at the same time, make provision for the growth in length of the bone, since^a plate of cartilage alwaysjnteiwe^^ epiphyieTan^^ This cartilage continues to be transformed into bone on both its surfaces by the extension of both the epiphysial and diaphysial ossification into it, and,

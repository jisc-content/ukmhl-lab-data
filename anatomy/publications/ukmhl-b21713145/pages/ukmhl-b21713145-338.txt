During subsequent development it continues to ni^rease injize until it forms a conical pouch arising from the colon just where it is joined by the small intes- tine (Fig. 179). The enlargement of its terminal portion does not keep pace, however, with that of the portion near- est the intestine, but it becomes grad- ually more and more marked off from it by its lesser caliber and gives rise to the vermiform appendix. At birth the original conical form of the entire outgrowth is still quite evi- dent, though it is more properly de- scribed as funnel-shaped, but later the proximal part, continuing to in- FiG. 179.â€”C/EcuM OF crease in diameter at the same rate Embryo of 10.2 cm. colon, becomes sharply sepa- c, Colon; i, ileum.

Up to the time when the embryo has reached a length of 14 mm., the inner surface of the intestine is quite smooth, but when a length of 19 mm. has been reached, the mucous membrane of the upper portion becomes thrown into longi- tudinal folds, and later these make their appearance through- out its entire length (Fig. 180). Later, in embryos of 60 mm., these folds break up into numbers of conical processes, the villi, which increase in number with the development of the intestine, the new villi appearing in the intervals between those already present. A remarkable phenomenon has recently been described as occurring in the duodenum of embryos of about 12.5 mm. It consists in a rapid growth in the thickness of the mucous"riiem- brane, whereby the lumen of the intestine immediately below the opening of the hepatic and pancreatic ducts becomes greatly reduced in size and is finally completely obliterated. This condition persists until the embryo has reached a length of 14.5

However that may be, true cartilage devel- 0£s_or^ither side of the ossifying region, and iiitglhTT^ ossification gradually extends, so that at least a portion of the bone is preformed in cartilage^ ' ^ The scapula is at first a smgle plate of cartilage in which two centers of ossification appear One of these gives rise to the body and the spine, while the other Fig. Cen- 109.—The Ossification TERS OF THE ScAPULA. a, h, and c, Secondary centers for the angle, vertebral border, and acromion; co, center for the cora- coid process.—(Testut.) ])n)(luccs tlie coracoid proc- ess (Fig. 109, co), the rudimentary representative of the coracoid bone which extends between the scap- ula and sternum in the lower vertebrates. The coracoid_ does not unite with the body until about the fifteenth year, and sec- ondary centers which give_ rise to the vertebral edge (b) and inferior angle of the bone_(a) and to the acromion process (c) unite with the rest of the bone at about the twentieth year. rhe hnincnis and the bones of the forearm are typical long bones, each of which develops from a primary center, whi^h gives rise to the shaft, and has, in addition, two or more epiphysial centers. In the humerus an epiphysial center appears for the head, another for the greater tuber- osity, and usually a third for the lesser tuberosity, while at the distal end there is a center for each condyle, one for

49^ THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER OF THE EYE. cavity which divides the mass into an inner and an outer portion. The cavity is the anterior chamber of the eye, and it has served to separate the cornea (co) from the tunica vasculosa lentis (tv), and, extending laterally in all direc- tions, it also. separates from the cornea the mesfiDphyme which rests upon the marginal portion of the optic cup and constitutes the stroma_ofjhe iris.__Cells arrange themselves on the corneal surface of the cavity to form a continuous endothelial layer, and the mesenchyme which forms the peripheral boundary of the cavity assumes a fibrous charac- ter and forms the limmentwn pectinatum iridis, among the fibers of which cavities, known as the spaces of Fontana (Fig. 270, sf), appear. Beyond the margins of the cavity the corneal tissue is directly continuous with the sclerotic, beneath the margin of which is a distinctly thickened por- tion of mesenchyme resting upon the ciliary processes and forming the stroma of the ciliary body, as well as giving rise to the muscle tissue which constitutes the ciliary muscle (Figs. 270 and 271, mc). The ectoderm which covers the outer surface of the eye does not proceed beyond the stage when it consists of sev- eral layers of cells, and never develops a stratum corneum. In the corneal region it rests directly upon the corneal tis- sue, which is thickened shg;htly upoiT_ its outer surface to form the anterior elastic laminu; more peripherally, how- ever. a quantity of loose mesodermal tissue lies between it and the outer surface of the sclerotic, and, together with the ectoderm, forms the coiijuncjiva [Fig. 265, cj). The Development of the Accessory Apparatus of the Eye. â€”The eyelids make their appearance at an early stage as two folds of skin, one a short distance above and the other below the cornea. The center of the folds is at first occu- pied by indifYerent mesodermal tissue, which later becomes modified to form the connective tissue of the lids and the

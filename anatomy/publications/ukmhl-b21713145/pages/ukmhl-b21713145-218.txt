204 DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCULAR SYSTEM. liially, there is formed a continuous mass of protoplasm or syncytium in which all traces of cell boundaries are lacking (Fig. 113). While the individual cells, or myoblasts as they are termed, are still recognizable, gran- ules appear in their cyto- plasm, and these arrange themselves in rows and unite to form slender fibrils, which at first do not extend beyond the limits of the myo- blasts in which they have appeared, but later, as the fusion of the cells proceeds, are con- tinued from one cell territory into the other through considerable Fig. 113.—Section THROUGH THE Heart- stretches of the syncy- WALL OF A Duck Embryo of Three . -.i ^ a . Days.—(M. Hcidenhain.) tium, without regard to the original cell areas. The fibrils multiply, apparently by longitudinal division, and arrange themselves in circles around areas of the syn- cytium (compare Fig. 114). As the multiplication of the fibrils continues those newly formed arrange themselves around the interior of each of the original circles and grad- ually occupy the entire cytoplasm, or sarcoplasm as it may now be termed, except immediately around the nuclei where, even in the adult, a certain amount of undifferen- tiated sarcoplasm persists. Tlie fibrils when first formed are apparently homogeneous, but later they become differ- entiated into two distinct substances which alternate with

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. 282 brought to the limb is collected by a vein which passes dis- tally along the radial border of the limb bud, around its di_staljx)rder, and proximally along its ulnar border to open into the anterior cardinal _vein; this_2S the primary ulnar veuL__ Later a second vein grows out from the external jugular along the radial border of the limb, representing the cepJmlic vein of the adult, and on its appearance the digital veins, which were formed from the primary ulnar vein, become connected with it, and the distal portion of the pri- mary ulnar vein disappears. Its_2roximal portion persists, however, to form the basilic vein, from which the brachial vein and its continuation, the ulnar vein, are developed, while the radial vein develops as an outgrowth from the cephalic, which at an early stage secures an opening into the axillary vein, its original communication with the exter- nal jugular forming the jugulo-cephalic vein. In the lower limb a primary fibular vein, exactly compar- able to the primary ulnar of the arm, surrounds the distal border of the limb-bud and passes up its fibular border to open with the posterior cardinaWein. The iurther devel- opment in the lower limb differs considerably, however, from that of the upper limb. From the.^£rmiary fibidaryei^^^ an anterior tibial vein grows out, which receives the digital branches from the toes, and from the posterior cardinal, anterior to the point where the primary fibular opens into jt, a vein grows down the tibial side of the leg, forming the long saphenous vein. From this the femoral vein is formed and from it the posterior tibial vein is continued down the lee. An anastomosis is formed between the femoral and the primary fibular veins at the level of the knee and the proximal portion of the latter vein then becomes greatly reduced, while its distal portion possibly persists as the small saphenous vein (Hochstetter).

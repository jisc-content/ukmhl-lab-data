468 THE INTERNAL EAR. In connection with the spiral organ certain adjace.nt celb also retain their columnar forni and undergo various modi- fications, giving rise to a rather complicated structure whose development has been traced in the ral^bit. Along the whole length of the cochlear duct the cells resting upon that half of the basilar membrane which is nearest the axis of the cochlea, and may be termed the inner half, retain their columnar sha^e, forming two ridgesjgrojectmg.slightly into the cavity of the scala (Fig. 252). The cells of the inner ridge, much the lal-ger of the two, give rise to the mem- brana tectoria, either a^ a cuticular s.e;£xeliDn oi"_ by the_arti- ficial adhesion of long hair-like processes whichj^roject from their free surfaces (Ayers). The cells of the outer rj_dge are arranged in six longitudinal rows (Fig. 252, 1-6) ; those of the innermost row (i) develop hairs upon their free sur- faces and form the inner hair cells, those of the next two rows (2 and 3) gradnallv 1)ecome transformed on their adjacent surfaces into chitinqus substance and form the rods of Corti, while the three outer row s (4 to 6) develop into the outer hair cells. It is hi connection with the hair cells that the periplieral prolongations of the cells of the cochlear ganglion terminate, and since these hair cells are arranged in rows extendijig the entire length of the cochlear duct, the ganglion also is drawn oj,itJnto„A-Sp.iral following; tl^ of the cochlea, and hence is sometimes termed the spiral ganglion. While the various changes described above have been raking place in the otocyst, the mesoderm surrounding it has also been undergoing development. At first this tissue is quite uniform m,character, but later the_cells immediately surrounding the otocyst condense to give ,rise to a^fiferous layer (Fig. 253, ep) whilejiiore, peripherally they become, more loosely arranged jind^form_ a somewhat gelatinous iayer^^and still more peripherally a second fibrous layer

From the more ventral portion of each dorsal zone there is formed a thickening, the corpus striatum (Figs. 233, cs, and 226, VI 2), a structure which is for the telencephalon what the optic thalamus is for the diencephalon, while from the more dorsal portion there is formed the remaining or mantle (pallial) portions of the hemispheres (Figs. 233, h, and 226, VI 4). When first formed, the hemispheres are slight evaginations from the median portion of the telencephalon, the openings by which their cavities communicate with the third ventricle, the mter- vcntricular foramina, being relatively very large (Fig. 233), but, in later stages (Fig. 226), the hemispheres increase more markedly and eventually surpass all the other portions of the brain in magnitude, overlapping and completely con- cealing the roof and sides of the diencephalon and mesen- cephalon and also the anterior surface of the cerebellum. In this enlargement, however, the interventricular foramina share only to a slight extent, and consequently become rela- tively smaller (Fig. 226), forming in the adult merely slit- like openings lying between the lamina terminalis and the thalami and having for their roof the anterior portion of the velum interpositum. The velum interpositum,—that is to say, the roof-plate,— where it forms the roof of the interventricular foramen, is prolonged out upon the dorsal surface of each hemisphere, and, becoming invaginated, forms upon it a groove. As the hemispheres, increasing in height, develop a mesial wall, the groove, which is the so-called chorioidal fissure, comes to lie along the ventral edge of this wall, and as the growth of the hemispheres continues it becomes more and more elon- gated, being carried at first Ixickward (Fig. 234), then ven- trally, and finally forward to end at the tip of the temporal lobe. After the establishment of the grooves the mesen-

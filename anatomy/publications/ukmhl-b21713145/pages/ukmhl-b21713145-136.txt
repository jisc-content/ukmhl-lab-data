THE ALLANTOIS AND BELLY-STALK. I 22 Uterus in the latter, the arrangement for the passage of the excreted material into the maternal blood being so per- fect that there is practically no need for the development of an allantoic cavity. The portion of the endodermal diverticulum which is enclosed within the umbilical cord persists until birth in a more or less rudimentary condition, but the intra-embryonic portions of the allantois reach a greater development, the more^proximal portions acc{uiring a cavity of considerable extejit^and fomuiig the urop-enitnl sinn^i and the urinary i bladcler, while the portion intervening between the apex of ' the bladder and the umbilicus becomes converted into a I solid cord of fibrous tissue termed the iirachus. Occasionally a lumen persists in the urachal portion of the allantois and may open to the exterior at the umbilicus, in which case urine from the bladder may escape at the umbilicus. Since the allantois in the human embryo, as well as in the lower forms, is responsible for respiration and excre- tion, its blood-vessels are well developed. They are repre- sented in the belly-stalk by two veins and two arteries (Fig. 64), known in human embryology as the umbilical veins and arteries, which extend from the body of the embryo out to the chorion, there branching repeatedly to enter the numerous chorionic villi by which the embryonic tissues are placed in relation with the maternal. The Umbilical Cord.â€”During the process of closing in of the ventral surface of the embryo, a stage is reached in which the embryonic and extra-embryonic portions of the body-cavity are completely separated except for a small area, the umbilicus, through which the yolk-stalk passes out (Fig. 63, B). At the edges of this area in front and at the sides the embryonic ectoderm and somatic mesoderm become continuous with the corresponding layers of the amnion, but posteriorly the line of attachment of the am-

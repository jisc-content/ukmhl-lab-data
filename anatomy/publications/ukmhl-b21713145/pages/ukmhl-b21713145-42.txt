THE MATURATION OF THE OVUM. 28 mosomes in the somatic cells (Fig. 13, oc') and at the meta- phase a dyad from each tetrad passes into each of the two cells that are formed. These two cells (secondary oocytes) are not, however, of the same size; one of them is almost Fig. 13.â€”Diagram Illustrating the Reduction of the Chromo- somes DURING the Maturation of the Ovum. 0, Ovum; oocyte of the first generation; oc^, oocyte of the second generation; p, polar globule. as large as the original primary oocyte and continues to be called an ovum (oc^), while the other is very small and is termed a polar globule (p). A second division of the ovum quickly succeeds the first (Fig. 13, oc^), and each dyad

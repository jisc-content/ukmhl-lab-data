43 THE SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM. the fourth is circular and cuts off the inner ends of the six cells previously formed (Fig. i8, D). The disk now con- sists of six central smaller cells surrounded by six larger peripheral ones. Beyond this period no regularity can be discerned in the appearance of the seg-mentation planes; but radial and circular divisions continuing to form, the disk becomes divided into a large number of cells, those at the center being much smaller than those at the periphery. In the meantime, however, the smaller central cells have begun Y Fig. 19.â€”Diagram Illustrating a Section of the Ovum of a Reptile at a Stage Corresponding to the Blastula of an Amphibian. bl, Blastoderm; Y, yolk-mass. to divide in planes parallel to the surface of the disk, which, tljoiIlMngL^L-sk^^ thus becomes a discoidal cell-mass. During the segmentation of the disk it has increased materially in size, extending further and further over the surface of the yolk, into the substance of which some of the lower cells of the discoidal cell-mass have penetrated. A comparison of the diagram (Fig. 19) of the ovum of a reptile at about this stage of development with the figure of the amphibian blastula (Fig. 17, D) will indicate the

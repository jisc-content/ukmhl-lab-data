103 THE MESODERMIC SOMITES. cubical masses which are termed the protovertebrce or, better, mesodermic somites (Fig. 58, wz^), structures whose appear- ance in surface views has already been described (Fig. 41 et seq.). The cells of the somites and of the lateral parts, which may be termed the ventral mesoderm, are at first stellate in form, but later become more spindle-shaped, and those near the center of each somite and those of the ventral mesoderm arrange themselves in regular layers so as to en- close cavities which appear in these regions (Fig. 58). The Fig. 59.—Transverse Section of an Embryo of 2.5 mm. (See Fig. 42) SHOWING on either SIDE OF THE MEDULLARY CaNAL A MeSO- dermic Somite, the Intermediate Cell-mass, and the Ventral Mesoderm.— {von Lenhossek.) cavities of the somites first formed become continuous with the cavities contained between the layers of the adjacent ventral mesoderm, but this continuity eventually disappears and is not developed in the later formed somites. Each original lateral plate of gastral mesoderm thus becomes divided longitudinally into three areas, a more median area

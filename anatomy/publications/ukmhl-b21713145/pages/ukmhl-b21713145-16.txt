Later, in 1846, a botanist, von Mohl, observed that living plant cells contained a similar substance, upon which he believed the existence of the cell as a vital structure was dependent, and he bestowed upon this substance the name protoplasm, by which it is now universally known. By these discoveries the importance originally attributed to the cell-wall was greatly lessened, and in 1864 Max Schultze reformulated the cell theory, defining the cell as a mass of protoplasm, the presence or absence of a limiting membrane or cell-wall being immaterial. At the same time the spontaneous origination of cells from an undifferen- tiated matrix, believed to occur by the older authors, was shown to, have no existence, every cell originating by the divisign of a preexisting cell, a fact concisely expressed in the aphorism of Virchow—omnis cellula a celluld. Interpreted in the light of these results, the human body is an aggregate of myriads of cells,*—i. e., of masses Qjf protoplasm, each of which owes its origin to the division of a; preexistent cell and all of which may be traced back t^ a^ single parent cell—a fertilized ovum. All these cells are not alike, however, but just as in a social community one group of individuals devotes itself to the performance of Qne of. fche duties requisite to the well-being of the commu- nity and another group devotes itself to the performance of another duty, so too, in the body, one group of cells takes upon itself one special function and another another. There is, in other words, in the cell-community a physiological * It has been estimated that the number of cells entering into the composition of the body of an adult human being is about twenty-six million five hundred thousand millions!

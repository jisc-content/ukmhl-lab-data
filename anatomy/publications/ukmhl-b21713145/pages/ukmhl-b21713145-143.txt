THE CHORIONIC VILLI. ectoderm differentiates into two layers, a superficial one in which the cell-boundaries disappear so that it consists of a continuous layer of protoplasm in which numerous nuclei are embedded (Fig. 69, A, s) and which is termed the syncytium, and an inner one, consisting of well-defined cells arranged in a single layer and termed the Langhans cells (Ic). It may be stated that the exact significance of these two layers is still under discussion, some authors believing the Langhans cells to be mesodermal, while others, admitting that Fig. 68.â€”Two Villi from the Chorion of an Embryo of 7 mm. they are ectodermal, maintain the view that the syncytium is really maternal tissue. The view here presented is most in accord with the more recent observations (Minot, Peters, Mar- chand, Rossi Doria). As development proceeds the villi, which are at first dis- tributed evenly over the chorion frondosum, are separated into groups termed cotyledons (Fig. 70) by the growth into the intervillous space of trabeculae from the walls of

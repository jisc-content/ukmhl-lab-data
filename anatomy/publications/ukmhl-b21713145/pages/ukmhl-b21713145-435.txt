THE DIENCEPHALON. 421 The Development of the Diencephalon.—A transverse section through the diencephalon of an embryo of about five weeks (Fig. 231) shows clearly the differentiation of this portion of the brain into the typical zones, the roof-plate (rp) being represented by a thin-walled, somewhat folded area, the floor-plate (fp) by the tissue forming the floor of a well-marked ventral groove, while" each lateral wall is divided into a dorsal and ventral zone by a groove known as the sulcus Monroi (Sin), which extends forward and ventrally toward the point of origin of the optic evagination (Fig. 233). At the posterior end of the ridge-like elevation which represents the roof-plate is a rounded elevation (Fig. 232, p) which, in later stages, elongates until it almost reaches the dermis, forming a hollow evagination of the brain roof known as the pineal process. The distal extremity of this process enlarges to a sac-like structure which later becomes lobed, and, by an active pro- liferation of the cells lining the cavities of the various lobes, finally becomes a solid structure, the pineal body. The more proximal portion of the evagination, remaining hol- low, forms the pineal stalk, and the entire structure, bodv and stalk, constitutes what is known as the epiphysis. The significance of this organ in the Mammalia is doubtful in the Reptiha and other lower forms the outgrowth is double" a secondary outgrowth arising from the base or from the anterior wall of the primary one. This anterior evao-ination elongates until it reaches the dorsal epidermis of the head and Fig. 231.—Transverse Sec- tion OF THE Diencephalon OF AN Embryo of Five Weeks. ds, Dorsal zone; fp, floor-plate; rp, roof-plate; Stn, sulcus Monroi; V2, ventral zone.— (His.)

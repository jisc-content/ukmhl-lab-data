THE GENITAL DUCTS. 38o upper ends persisting in connection with the epoophora, while their lower ends persist as straight tubules lying at the sides of the vagina and forming what are known as the canqhof Gartner. The Miillerian ducts, on the other hand, become converted into the Fallopian tubes {tuhce uterince), and in their lower portions into the uterus and vagina. From the margins of the openings by which the Miillerian ducts communicate with the coelom projections develop at an early period and give rise to the fimhricE, with the excep- tion of the one connected with the ovary, the fimbria ovarica,\ which is the upper persisting portion of the original genital ridge, it_s_lower portion, below the ovary, bejng represented by^Jhe ovarian and inguinal ligament already described. It has been seen that the lower portions of the Miillerian ducts fuse together to form a single canal, and it is from this that the uterus and vagina are differentiated, the histological distinction of the two portions commencing to manifest itself at about the third month. During the fourth month the vaginal portion of the duct becomes flattened and the epithelium lining its lumen fuses so as to completely occlude it and, a little later, there appears near its lower opening a distinct semicircular fold attached to its dorsal margin. This is the hymen, a structure which seems to be repre- sented in the male by the veru montanum. The oblitera- tion of the lumen of the vagina persists until about the sixth month, when the cavity is re-established by the break- ing down of the central epithelial cells. The diagram. Fig. 211, illustrates the transformation from the indifferent condition which occurs in the two sexes, and that the homologies of the various parts may be clearly understood they may also be stated in tabular form as on the next page. In addition to the sessile hydatid, a stalked hydatid also occurs in connection with the testis, and a similar structure is

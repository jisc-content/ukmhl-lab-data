THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA. The Development of the External Genitalia.—At about the^^fth_week. before the urogenital sinus has opened to the exterior^.the mesenchyme on its ventral wall begins to thicken, j)roducing a slight projection to the exterior. This eminence, whiciris known as the o^enital tubercle (Fig. 212, gt), rapidlyincreases in size, its extremity becomes some- what bulbonsly eiilarged~7Fig.'214, gl) and a ^-roove. exr— tending to the base of the terminal enlargement, appears upon its vestibular surface, the lips of the groove forming Fig. 214.—The External Genitalia of an Embryo of 25 mm. a, Anus; gf, genital fold; gl, glans; gs, genital swelling; p, perineal body.— ( Keihel.) two well-marked genital folds (Fig. 214, ^/). At about the tenth week there aj)pears on either side of the tubercle an enlargement termed the genital swelling (Fig. 214, gs), which is due to a thickening of the mesenchyme of the lower part of the ventral abdominal wall in_the_j-eg-ion where the inguinal ligament is attached, and with the ap- pearance of these structures the indifferent stage of the external genitals is completed. In the female the growth of the genital tubercle proceeds rather slowly and it becomes transformed into the clitoris, the genital folds becoming prolonged to form tlie labia minora.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE JOINTS. 200 are shown by comparative studies to be in many cases de- generated portions of what were originally muscles. In certain diarthroses, such as the temporo-mandibular and sterno-clavicular, the whole of the central portions of the intermediate mesenchyme does not degenerate, but it is converted into a filDro-cartilage, between each surface of which and the adjacent bone there is a cavity. These inter- FiG. 112.—Longitudinal Section through the Joint of the Great Toe in an Embryo of 4.5 cm. c, Articular capsule; i, intermediate mesenchyme which has almost disappeared in the center; and p', cartilages of the first and second phalanges.— (Nicholas.) articular cartilages seem, in the sterno-clavicular joints, to represent the sternal ends of a bone existing in lower verte- brates and known as the precoracoid, but it seems doubtful if those of the temporo-mandibular joints have a similar significance, the most recent observations on their develop- ment tending to associate them with the external pterygoid muscles (Kjellberg).

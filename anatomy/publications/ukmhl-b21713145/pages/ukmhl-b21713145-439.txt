The cords later on divide transversely to a greater or less extent to form alveoli, the entire struc- ture coming to resemble somewhat the parathyreoid bodies (see p. 315), and, like these, having the functic^n of pro- /./• W $'5 Fig. 233.—Median Longitudinal Section of the Brain of an Em- bryo OF 16.3 MM. br, Anterior brachium; eg, corpus geniculatum laterale; cs, corpus striatum; h, cerebral hemisphere; ir, infundibular recess- It lamma terminahs;_or, optic recess; ot, thalamus; p, pineal process- sm, sulcus Monroi; st, hypothalamic region; vi velum interposi- tum.— {His.) ducing an internal secretion. The posterior lobe, derived from the brain, retains its connection with that structure, its stalk being the infundihulum, but its terminal portion does not undergo such extensive modifications as does the ante- rior lobe, although it is claimed that it gives rise to a glandu- lar epithelium which may become arranged so as to form alveoli. The cerebral hemispheres are formed from the lateral 37

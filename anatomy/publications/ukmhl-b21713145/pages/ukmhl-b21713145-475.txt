461 THE INTERNAL EAR. papilku which occur in the adult do not develop simulta- neously, but their number increases with the age of the fetus, and there is, moreover, considerable variation in the time of their development. The taste-buds are formed by a differentiation of the epithelium which covers the papillae, and this differentiation appears to stand in intimate relation with the penetration of fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve into the papillae. The buds form at various places upon the papillae, and at one period are especially abundant upon their free surfaces, but in the later weeks of intrauterine life these surface buds undergo degeneration and only those upon the sides of the trench persist, as a rule. The foliate papillae do not seem to be developed until some time after the circumvallate, being entirely wanting in em- bryos of four and a half and five months, although plainly recognizable at the seventh month. The Development of the Ear.—It is customary to de- scribe the mammalian ear as consisting of three parts, known as the inner, middle, and outer ears, and this division is, to a certain extent at least, confirmed by the embryonic devel- opment. The inner ear, which is the sensory portion proper, is an ectodermal structure, which secondarily becomes deeply seated in the mesodermal tissue of the head, while the middle and outer ears, which provide the apparatus necessary for the conduction of the sound-waves to the inner ear, are modi- fied portions of the anterior branchial arches. It will be convenient, accordingly, in the description of the ear, to accept the usually recognized divisions and to consider first of all the development of the inner ear, or, as it is better termed, the otocyst. The Development of the^ Otoc^t.—In an embryo, of 2.4 mm. a pair of pits occur upon the surface of the body about opposite the middle portion of the hind-brain (Fig. 247, A),

339 THE DIAPHRAGM. decidedly obliquejn position, a rliange associatedjith^the backward movement of the heart. As the closure^of the ventral wall of the body extends posteriorly the ventral edge of the septum gradually slips downward upon it, while the dorsal edge is held in its former position by its attachment to the wall of jthe digestive tract an^ the ductus _Cuvieri. The anterior surface of the septum thus comes to look ven- trally as well as forward, and the parietal cavity, having taken up into itself the blind pouches which represented the ventral recesses, comes to lie to a large extent ventral to the posterior recesses. As may be seen from Fig. i88, the ductus Cuvieri. as they bend from the lateral walls of the body into the free edges of the septum, form a marked' projection which diminishes considerably the opening of the dorsal recesses into the parietal cavity. In later stages this projection increases and from ifs dorsal edge a fold, which may be regarded as a continuation of the free edge of the septum, projects into the upper portions of the recesses and eventually fuses with the median portion of the septum attached to the wall of the gut. In this way the parietal cavity becomes a completely closed sac, and is henceforward known as the pericardial cavity, the original ccelom being now divided into two portions, (i) the pericardial, and (2) the pleuro-peritoneal cavities, the latter consisting of the abdominal coelom together with the two dorsal parietal recesses which have been separated from the pericardial (parietal) cavity and are destined to be converted into the pleural cavities. The Formation of the Diaphragm.â€”It is to be remem- bered that the attachment of the transverse septum to the ventral wall of the digestive tract is opposite the point where the liver outgrowth develops. When, therefore, the out- growth appears, it pushes its way into the substance of the septum, which thus acquires a very considerable thickness,

DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. J > < / at once established. Before, however, the vascularization Tcaches"^the embryo some of the canals begin to enlarge (Fig. 126, A), producing arteries and veins, the rest of_tlie net- work formirig'capinaries uniting these two sets of vessels, and, this process continu- ing, there are eventually . differentiated a sjngle om- V pJialo-mesenteric{mtelline) artery and two omphalo- ") mesenteric {vitelline') veins (Fig. T26, J5). In the human embryo the small size af__the-jyQlk- v sac permits of the exten- sion of the vascular area over its entire surface at an early period, and this condition has already been reached in the earliest stages known and conse- quently no sinus terminalis such as occurs in the rab- l)it is visible.

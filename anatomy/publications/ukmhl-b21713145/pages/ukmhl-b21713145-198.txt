84 OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. is known as the hasisphenoid, and still later a center appears on either side of the basisphenoids to form the lingulce (/), and another pair appears in the anterior part of the carti- lage, between the orbitosphenoids, and represent the pre- sphenoid. In addition to these ten centers, all of which are formed in cartilage, certain other membrane bones are included in the adult sphenoid. Thus, a little before the appearance of the center for the alisphenoids an ossification is formed in the mesenchyme of the lateral wall of the posterior part of the nasal cavity and gives rise to the medial lamina of the pterygoid process, the mesenchyme at the tip of the ossification condensing to form a cartilaginous hook-like structure over which the tendon of the tensor veli palatini plays. This cartilage later ossifies to form the pterygoid hamulus, the medial pterygoid lamina being thus a combi- nation of membrane and cartilage, the latter, however, being a secondary development and quite independent of the chon- drocranium. It is probable also that the upper anterior angle of each alisphenoid is formed by ossification of the mesenchyme in this situation and recent observations seem to show that the lateral lamina of the pterygoid process develops as an ossification of mesenchyme situated laterally to the medial lamina (Fawcett). The lateral' pterygoid laminae early unite with the alisphe- noids, by the sixth month the lingulae have fused with the hasisphenoid and the orbitosphenoids with the presphenoid, and a little later the hasisphenoid and presphenoid unite. The alisphenoids and medial pterygoid laminae remain sepa- rate, however, until after birth, fusing with the remaining portions of the adult bone during the first year. The cartilage of the ethmoidal region of the chondro- cranium forms somewhat later than the other portions and consists at first of a stout median mass projecting down-

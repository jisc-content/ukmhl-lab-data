i6i DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Two views exist as to the mode of formation of the matrix, some authors rnaintajn^ it is produced by the actual transfoirnation of the mesen- chyme cells into fibers, while others_^laim_that_it is manu- factured by the cellsbut does no^directly represent the cells themselves. Fibrils and material out of v^hich fibrils could be~Tormed have undoubtedly been observed in connective- tissue cells, but whether or not these are later passed to the exterior of the cell to form a connective-tissue fiber is not yet certain, and on this hangs mainly the difference between Fig. 88.â€”Portion of the Center of Ossification of the Parietal Bone of a Human Embryo. the theories. Recently it has been held (Mall) that the mesenchyme of the embryo_is really a syncytium in and 4' from the protoplasm of which the matrix forms; if this be correct, the distinction which the older views make between the intercellular and intracellular origin of the matrix be- comes of little importance. Bone differs from the other varieties of connective tissue in that it is never a primary formation, but is always devel- oped either in fibrous tissue or cartilage; and according as it is associated with the one or the other, it is spoken of as 15

At the same time, too^,~the uterine tissues sur- rounding^ ovum grow up around it. forming at first as itjvvere^gT^ular walL-(Fig. 67, A), and eventually com- pletely enclose it, forming an envelope known as the decidua I ca^sularis or renexa. The blood extravasation is now con- tained within a closed space bounded on the one hand by the uterine tissues and on the other by the wall of the ovum (Fig. 67, B). Over either the whole or a greater portion of the surface of the ovum processes, termed chorionic villi, now begin to grow out from the chorion into the surrounding blood space (Fig. 67, B), some floating freely in the space, while others traverse it and come into contact by their extremities with the unaltered uterine tissues, forming what are termed fixation villi. Later the portion of the blood space bounded by the decidua capsularis disappears and with it the villi from the corresponding portion of the chorion, so that this latter structure becomes differentiated into two regions (Fig. 67, C), one which is destitute or practically so of villi, the chorion Jccve, and one, the chorion frondosum, corix- sponding^to_tliejittachment of the belly-stalk, provided with them. The blood space into which the villi project is usu- ally termed the intervillous space. The villi are at first irregularly lobed processes, formed by asolid massjpfectodenpallraijhQderm rells. As devel- opment proceeds the lobes become much more slender and branch so that each villus assumes a dendriti£_faniL Iii the meantime, however, processes from the chorionic meso- derm grow out nito each villus, extending out even into the terminal branches and forming ji_central core in which bl£od-yessels_jlev^ whirji become confinnnu^ with the umbilical arteries and veins.

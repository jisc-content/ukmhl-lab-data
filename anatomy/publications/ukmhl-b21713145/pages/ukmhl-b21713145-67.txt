53 FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. the ectoderm (Fig. 26, cc), and a subjacent mass of some- what scattered cells. Later the lowermost cells of this sub- jacent mass arrange themselves in a continuous layer, con- stituting what is termed the primary cndoderm {en^), while the remaining cell%, aggregated especially in the region of the crescentic groove, form the prostomial mesoderm (prm). In the region enclosed by the groove a distinct delimitation of the various layers does not occur, and this region forms the primitive streak. The groove now begins to deepen.

In the gecko (Will) it pushes forward be- tween the ectoderm and primary endoderm almost to the anterior edge of the blastoderm, but later the cells forming its floor, together with those of the primary endoderm im- mediately below, undergo a degeneration, the roof cells at the lateral margins of the invagination becoming contin-

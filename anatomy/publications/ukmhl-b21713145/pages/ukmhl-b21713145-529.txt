POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. is to preserve its contact with the mandibular fossa, and this, again, demands a diminution of the angle at which the rami join if the teeth of the two jaws are to be in proper apposition. In the bones of the appendicular skeleton secondary epi- physial centers play an important part in the ossification, and in few are these centers developed prior to birth, while the union of the epiphyses to the main portions of the bones takes place only toward maturity. The dates at which the various primary and secondary centers appear, and the time at which they unite, may be seen from the following table: UPPER EXTREMITY. Bone. Clavicle Scapula. Body Coracoid ...

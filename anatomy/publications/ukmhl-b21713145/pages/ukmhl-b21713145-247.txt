21 233 " CHAPTER IX THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIRCULATORY AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS. At present nothing is known as to the eadiest stages of development of the circulatory system in the human embryo, but it may be supposed that they resemble in their funda- mental features what has been observed in such forms as the rabbit and the chick. In both these the system originates in two separate parts, one of whjcli, located in the embryonic mesoderm, giyesjjsejo the heart while the other, arising in the extraembryonic mesoderm. foj;ms Jhe^ fi_rst_blood- vessels. It will be convenient to consider these two parts separately, and the formation of the blood-vessels may be first described. In the rabbit the extension of the mesoderm from the embryonic region, where it first appears, over the yolk-sac is a gradual process, and it is in the more peripheral por- tions of the layer that the blood-vessels first make their appearance. They can be distinguished before the splitting of the mesoderm has been completed, but are ^Iways devel- oped in that portion of the layer which is most intimately associated with the yolk-sac, and consequently becomes the splanchiiic layer. The first indication of the vessels is the appearance in the peripheral portion of the mesoderm of cords or minute patches of spherical cells TFig. 124, A). These increase^in size by the division and separation of the cells from one. aiiotlier (Fig. 124, B), a cjear fluid appear- ing_in the intervals which separate them. Soon the cells surrounding each cord arrange themselves to form an en-

DEVELOPMENT OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. studied, as has also the final transformation of the condition described into that found in the adult. Lewis, from his observations on rabbit embryos, concludes that the lymphatics arise as outgrowths from the veins, but the outgrowths occur not only at the points indicated by Sabin, but ajsojtother points, as, for instance, near the root of the external mammary vein and in the vicinity of the azygos, gastric and superior mesenteric veins. The cond_- nuity^_of_these detached vessels with the veins was not actually observed, buMt is believed that they were out- growths which had separated from their veins, and__that they jeyentually unite with the jugular and femoraI jTint- growths to form a continuous lymphatic system. Ajthird view, that of Salg. and, more recently, of Hunt- ington and McClure, jjeriies the primary connection of the lymphatics with the veins, and maintains that they_are formed by^jthe^usion ofjnesenchymal spaces and only sec- ondarily make connection'^ wnth thp \re\n< Huntington and McClure find the first traces of the system in cat embryos in a series ^jjdisconnegted spaces in the tissue immediately sur- rcMmdingjdieJugular veins, and believe that these unite to form the anterior lymph hearts which subsequently become connected with the junction of the subclavian and jugular veins. Similar spaces occur in the_tissue surrmtndjng othei' veins, niid^Jjie^^anotis spaces eventuallv unite together to form the lymphatic system, and may make connections with vems other than the subclavian, as, for instance, the azygos. It is worthy of note that the spaces develop most rapidly where they are in association with regressive veins, and since it is in general the veins of the left side of the body which undergo the greatest amount of regression, an expla- nation is afforded of the situation of the thoracic duct on that side. Further observations are necessary to clear up the dis-

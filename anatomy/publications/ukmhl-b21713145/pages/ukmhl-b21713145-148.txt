THE DECIDU^. 134 this portion of the wall undergoes differ somewhat from those occurring- elsewhere. Consequently it becomes pos- sible to divide the deciducT into (i) a portion which is not in direct contact with the ovum, the decidua vera (Fig. 72, V) and (2) a portion which is. The latter portion'is again capable of division. The ovum becomes completely embedded in the mucosa, but, as has been pointed out, the Fig. 73.—Surface View of Half of the Decidua Vera at the End OF the Third Week of Gestation. d, Mucous membrane of the Fallopian tubes; ds, prolongation of the vera toward the cervix uteri; pp, papillae; rf, marginal furrow.— {Kolhnann.) chorionic villi reach their full development only over that portion of the chorion to which the belly-stalk is attached. The decidua which is in relation to this chorion frondosum undergoes much more extensive modifications than that in ■ relation to the chorion Iseve, and to it the name of decidua % basalis {decidua serotina) (Fig. 72, B) is applied, while

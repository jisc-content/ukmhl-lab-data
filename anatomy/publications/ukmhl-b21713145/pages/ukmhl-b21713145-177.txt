While these processes have been taking place the nTesenchyme surrounding the cartilage has become cc converted into a periosteum (/jo), similar to that of membrane bone, and its osteoblasts deposit a layer of bone (/>) upon the sur- face of the cartilage.

In the meantime the calcification of the cartilage matrix has been extending, and as fast as the net- work of calcified trabeculae is formed it is invaded by thel

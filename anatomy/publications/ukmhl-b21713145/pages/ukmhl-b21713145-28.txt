SPERMATOGENESIS. toward the lumen of the tubule, and in the third section the enlargement has increased to such an extent that the sper- matogonia are forced away from the basement membrane, with which the Sertoli cell alone is in contact. In the fourth section the spermatogonia are seen in process of division; one of the cells so formed will persist as a spermatogone, while the other forms what is termed a primary sperma- tocyte {sc^). The results of the division are seen in the last section, where four spermatogonia are seen again in contact with the basement membrane and above them are four primary spermatocytes. Returning now to the first and second sections, the layer of primary spermatocytes may still be seen, indications of an approaching division being furnished by the arrangement of the chromatin in those of the second section, and in the third section the division is seen in progress, the two cells which result from it being termed secondary spermatocytes (sc^). These cells almost immediately undergo division, as shown in the fourth section, each giving rise to two spermatids (sp), each of which becomes later on directly transformed into a sperma- tozoon (^^), From the primary spermatocyte there have been formed, therefore, as the result of two mitoses, four cells, each of which represents a spermatozoon. During these divisions important departures from the typical method of mitosia occur. These departures have been most thoroughly studied in the lower forms, but it is probable that they are fundamentally similar in the mam- malia. It has already been pointed out (p. 6) that the number of chromosomes which appear during the mitoses of the somatic cells is characteristic for the species. In the division of the primary spermatocytes the number of chromosomes which appear is apparently only half the char- acteristic number, but in reality it is double that number, since each chromosome is really composed of four elements

A), and as these increase in size and give rise to additional outgrowths, the structure of the lobes rapidly becomes com- plicated (Fig. 196, B and C). The lower primary process on each side may be regarded as a prolongation of the bronchus, while the remaining process or processes represent lateral outgrowths from it. Considerable difference of opinion has existed as to the nature of the further branching of the bronchi, some authors regarding it as a succession of dichotomies, one branch of each of these placing itself so as to be in thelin^ of thp 31

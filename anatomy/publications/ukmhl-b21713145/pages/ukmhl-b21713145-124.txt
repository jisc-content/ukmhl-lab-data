METAMERISM. I lO This metamerism is most distinct in the neck and trunk regions, and at first only in the dorsal portions of these regions, the ventral portions showing metamerism only after the extension into them of the myotomes. But there is clear evidence that the arrangement extends also into the head, and that this, like the rest of the body, is to be regarded as composed of metameres. It has been seen that in the notochordal region of the head of lower vertebrates mesodermic somites are present, while anteriorly in the pr^e- chordal region there are head-cavities which resemble closely the mesodermic somites, and may, perhaps, be directly com- parable to the somites of the trunk. There is reason, there- fore, for believing that the fundamental arrangement of all parts of the body is metameric, but though this arrangement is clearly defined in early embryos, it loses distinctness in later periods of development. But even in the adult the primary metamerism is clearly indicated in the arrangement of the nerves and of parts of the axial skeleton, and careful study frequently reveals indications of it in highly modified muscles and blood-vessels. In the head the development of the branchial arches and clefts produces a series of parts presenting many of the peculiarities of metameres, and, indeed, it has been a very | general custom to regard them as expressions of the general metamerism which prevails throughout the body. It is to be noted, however, that they are produced by the segmenta- tion of the ventral mesoderm, a structure which in the neck and trunk regions does not share in the general metamerism, and, furthermore, recent observations on the cranial nerves seem to indicate that these branchiomeres cannot be regarded as portions of the head metameres or even as structures comparable to these. They represent, more probably, a second metamerism superposed upon thejnore general one, or, indeed, possibly more primitive than it, but whose rela- :

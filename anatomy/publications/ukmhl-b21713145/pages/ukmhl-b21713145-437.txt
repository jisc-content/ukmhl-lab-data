THE DIENCEPHALON. which, with the subjacent portions of the velum, become invaginated into the cavity of the third ventricle to form its chorioid plexus. The dorsal zones thicken in their more dorsal and ante- rior portions to form massive structures, the thalami (Figs. 226, V2, and 232, ot), which, encroaching upon the cavity of the ventricle, transform it into a narrow slit-like space, so narrow, indeed, that at about the fifth month the inner surfaces of the two thalami come in contact in the median line, forming what is known as the intermediate mass. More ventrally and posteriorly another thickening of the dorsal zone occurs, giving rise on each side to the pulvinar of the thalamus and to a lateral geniculate body, and two ridges extending backward and dorsally from the latter structures to the thickenings in the roof of the mid-brain which represent the anterior corpora quadrigemina, give a path along which the nerve-fibers which constitute the supe- rior quadrigeminal brachia pass. From the ventral zones what is known as the hypothala- mic region develops, a mass of fibers and cells whose rela--* tions and development are not yet clearly understood, but which may be regarded as the forward continuation of the tegmentum and reticular formation. In the median line of the floor of the ventricle an unpaired thickening appears, representing the corpora mamillaria, which during the third month becomes divided by a median furrow into two rounded eminences; but whether these structures and the posterior portion of the tuber cinereum, which also develops from this region of the brain, are derivatives of the ventral zones or of the floor-plate Is as yet uncertain. Assuming that the mamillaria and the tuber cinereum are derived from the ventral zones, the origins of the structures formed from the walls of the diencephalon may be tabulated as follows:

119 THE ALLANTOIS AND BELLY-STALK. per cent, of cases it persists, forming a more or less exten- sive diverticulum of the lower part of the small intestine, sometimes only half an inch or so in length and sometimes much larger. It may or may not retain connection with the abdominal wall at the umbilicus, and is known as MeckeVs diverticiilum. This embryonic rudiment is of no little importance, since, when present, it is apt to undergo invagination into the lumen of the small intestine and so occlude it. How frequendy this happens relatively to the occurrence of the diverticulum may be judged from the fact that out of one hundred cases of occlu- sion of the small intestine six were due to an invagination of the diverticulum. In the reptiles and birds the yolk-sac is abundantly sup- plied with blood-vessels by means of which the absorption of the yolk is carried on, and even although the functional importance of the yolk-sac as an organ of nutrition is almost nil in the human embryo, yet it still retains a well-developed blood-supply, the walls of the vesicle, especially, possessing a rich network of vessels. The future history of these ves- sels, which are known as the omphalo-mesenteric vessels, will be described later on. The Allantois and Belly-stalk.â€”It has been seen that in reptilian and avian embryos the allantois reaches a high degree of development and functions as a respiratory and excretory organ by coming into contact with what is com- parable to the chorion of the mammalian embryo. In man it subserves similar functions, but is very much modified both in its mode of development and in its relations to other parts, so that its resemblance to the avian organ is some- what obscured. The differences depend partly upon the remarkable abbreviation manifested in the early develop- ment of the human embryo and partly upon the fact that the allantois serves to place the embryo in relation with the maternal blood, instead of with the external atmosphere,

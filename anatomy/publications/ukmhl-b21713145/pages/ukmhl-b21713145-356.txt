342 TI-IE PLEURA. of tlie diaphragm, the supply of whose musculature from the fourth cervical nerves is thus explained. The Pleurce.â€”The diaphragm is as yet, however, incom- plete dorsally, where the dorsal parietal recesses are still in continuity with the trunk-cavity. With the increase in thickness of the septum transversum, these recesses have acquired a considerable length antero-posteriorly, and into their upper portions the outgrowths from the lower part of the pharynx which form the lungs (see page 353) begin to project. The recesses thus become transformed into the pleural cavities, and as the diaphragm continues to descend, slipping down the ventral wall of the body and drawing with it the pericardial cavity, the latter comes to lie entirely ventral to the pleural cavities. The free borders of the diaphragm, which now form the ventral boundaries of the openings by which the pleural and peritoneal cavities communicate, begin to approach the dorsal wall of the body, with which they finally unite and so complete the separation of the cavities. The pleural cavities continue to enlarge after their separation and, extending laterally, pass between the pericardium and the lateral walls of the body until they finally almost completely surround the pericardium. The intervals between the two pleurae form what are termed the 7nediastina. The downward movement of the septum transversum extends through a very considerable interval, which may be appreciated from the diagram shown in Fig. 190. From this it may be seen that in early embryos the septum is situ- ated just in front of the first cervical segment and that it lies very obliquely, its free edge being decidedly posterior to its ventral attachment. When the downward displace- ment occurs, the ventral edge at first moves more rapidly than the dorsal, and soon comes to lie at a much lower level. The backward movement continues throughout the entire

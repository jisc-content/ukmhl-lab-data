IMPLANTATION OF THE OVUM. the cells become thicker and later form a syncytial projer- tion or knob which comes into contact with the uterine mucosa (Fig. 66, B), and at the point of contactjthe mucosa cells undergo degeneration, allowing the knob to come into relation with the deeper tissues of the uterus (Fig. 66, C), / the process apparently being one in which the mucosa cells ^ I are eroded by the syncytial knob. It seems probable that in the human ovum the process is C Fig. 66.—Successive Stages in the Implantation of the Ovum of THE SpERMOPPIILE. a, syncytial knob; k, inner cell md.?.s.—{Rejsek.) at first of a similar nature and that as the covering layer cells come into contact with the deeper layers of the uterus, these too are eroded, and, the uterine blood-vessels being included in the erosion process, an extravasation of blood plasma and corpuscles occurs in the vicinity of the burrow- ing ovum. In the meantime the ovum has increased con- siderably in size, its growth in these early stages being

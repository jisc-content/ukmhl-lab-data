DEVELOPMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLES. 207 can be perceived in comparatively few muscles. The exact nature of these modifications is almost unknown from direct observation, but since the relation between a nerve and the myotome belonging- to the same segment is established at a very early period of development and persists throughout life, no matter what changes of fusion, splitting, or migra- tion the myotome may undergo, it is possible to trace out more or less completely the history of the various myotomes by determining their segmental innervation. It is known, for example, that the latissimus dorsi arises from the seventh and eighth* cervical myotomes, but later undergoes a migra- tion, becoming attached to the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and to the crest of the ilium, far away from its place of origin (Mall), and yet it retains its nerve-supply from the seventh and eighth cervical nerves with which it was originally associated, its nerve-supply consequently in- dicating the extent of its*migration. By following the indications thus afforded, it may be seen that the changes which occur in the myotomes may be re- ferred to one or more of the following processes : 1. A longitudinal splitting into two or more portions, a process well illustrated by the trapezius and sternomastoid, which have differentiated by the longitudinal splitting of a single sheet and contain therefore portions of the same myo- tomes. The sterno-hyoid and omohyoid have also differ- entiated by the same process, and, indeed, it is of frequent occurrence. 2. A tangential splitting into two or more layers. Ex- amples of this are also abundant and are afforded by the muscles of the fourth, fifth, and sixth layers of the back, as recognized in English text-books of anatomy, by the two *TIii.s enumeration is based on convenience in associating the myo- tomes with the nerves which supply them. The myotomes mentioned are those which correspond to the sixth and seventh cervical vertebra

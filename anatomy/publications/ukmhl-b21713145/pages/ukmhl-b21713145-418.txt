404 THE HISTOGENESIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. aggregate to form a nerve, that formed by the axis-cylinders being the posterior root of a spinal nerve, while that formed by the dendrites soon tmites with the ventral nerve-root^of the corresponding segment to form the main stem ^f a spinal nerve. There is thus a very important difference in the mode of development of the two nerve-roots, the__a^ds-C}d]nd^^ of the ventral roots arising^ from cells situated in the wall of the medullarv canal and growing outward (ceritrifu- gally), while those of the dorsal root sprmg from cells situ- d Fig. 223.—Cells from the Gasserian Ganglion of a Guinea-pig Embryo. a, Bipolar cell; h and c, transitional stages to d, T-shaped cells.— {von Gehuchten.) nted peripherallv and ^row inwM'd (centripetally) toward the medullary canal. In_the_niajority of the dorsal root ganglia the points of origin of the two processes of each bi^poTarcelT gradually approach one another and eventually come to^ri^e from a common stem, a process of the cell-body, which thus assumes a characteristic T form. From what has been said it will be seen that each axis- cylinder is an outgrowth from a single neuroblast and is part of its cell-body, as are also the dendrites. Another view has, however, been advanced to the effect that the nerve fibers first

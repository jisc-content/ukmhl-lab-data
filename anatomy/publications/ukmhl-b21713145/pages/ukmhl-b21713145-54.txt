THE SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM. 40 ovnm of Amphioxus in its first division separates into two similar and equal cells, and these are made four (Fig. i6, A) by a second plane of division which cuts the previous one at right angles. A third plane at right angles to both the preceding ones brings about an eight-celled stage (Fig. i6, B), and further divisions result in the formation of a large number of cells which arrange themselves in the form of a hollow sphere which is known as a hlastula (Fig. i6, E). Fig. i6.—Stages in the Seg MENTATION OF AlHpJllOXUS. A, Four-celled stage; B, eight-celled stage; C, sixteen-celled stage; D, early blastula; E, blastula; F, section of blastula.— (Hatschck.) The minute amount of yolk which is present in the ovum of Amphioxus collects at an early stage of the segmentation at one pole of the ovum, the cells containing it being some- what larger than those of the other pole (Fig. i6, B), and in the blastula the cells of one pole are larger and more richly laden with yolk than those of the other pole (Fig. i6, F). If, now, the segmenting ovum of an Amphibian be examined, it will be found that a very much greater amount of yolk is present and, as in y4/;//'/HV;.t-//^, it is located especially at one ])ole of the ovum. The first three planes of segmentation have the same relative positions as in

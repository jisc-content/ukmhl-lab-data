69 DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. the yolk-sac also to a certain extent forms part of the embryo. This embryo seems to be in an early stage of the primi- tive streak formation, before the development of the head process. On comparing it with the ovum of a bat in ap- proximately the stage of development represented in Fig. 28, C, it will be seen to present some important advances (Fig. 36). It seems clear that the yolk-sac is equivalent to what was the cavity of the ovum in the earlier stages, and consequently the cavity (c) into which the yolk-sac projects is unrepresent^r] in ttTen^aF^' lnajnTT" How tHTs cavity is formed can only be conjectured, but it seems probable that it arises by the splitting of the layer of cells which lines the interior of the trophoderm in the bat's ovum (or perhaps by the vacuolization of the central cells of this layer) and the subsequent accumulation of fluid between the two mesodermal layers so formed. However that may be, it seems clear that the size of the human ovum is due mainly to the rapid growth of this cavity, which, as future stages show, is the extra-embryonic portion of the body^ cavity the splitting or vacuolization of the mesoderm by which [t i^ probably formed being the precocious appear- ance of the ty])ical splitting of the nip^ndern-^ to. form the embryonic body-cavitv which, as will be seen in a subse- quent chapter, takes place only at a later stage of develop- ^ ment. Froni now on the trophoderm and the layer of me- soderm lining it may together be spoken of as the chorion, the mesoderm layer being termed the chorionic mesoderm. A human embryo of a somewhat greaTeF age~(Fig! 37), measuring about jnm. in length, has been described by Graf Spec as embryo v.H., and was taken from an ovum estimated to measure 6 by 4.5 mm. in diameter. Notwith- standing the much greater size of the ovum, which is due to the continued increase in the size of the extra-embryonic

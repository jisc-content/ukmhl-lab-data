THE GENITAL DUCTS. 378 ing from the portion of the Wolffian ckict which forms the globus minor of the epididymis, represents another portion of it and is known as the vas aherrans. The Wolffian duct is retained complete, the portion of it nearest the testis becoming greatly elongated and thrown into numerous coils, forming the body and globus minor of the epididymis, while the remainder of it is converted into the vas deferens and the ductus ejaculatorius. A lat- eral outpouching of the wall of the duct to form a longi- tudinal fold appears at about the third month and gives rise to the vesicida seminalis, the lateral position of the out- growth explaining the adult position of the vesiculse lateral to the vasa deferentia. With the Miillerian duct the case is very different, since it disappears completely throughout the greater part of its course, only its upper and lower ends persisting, the former giving rise to a small sac-like body, the sessile hydatid of Morgagni, attached to the upper end of the testis near the epididymis, while the latter is represented by a depression in the floor of the urethra known as the sinus pocularis, which is usually prolonged upward into a short cylindrical pouch known as the uterus masculinus, although it corre- sponds to the vagina rather than to the uterus of the female. In the Female.â€”In the female the genital portion of the mesonephros, though never functional as ducts, persists as a group of ten to fifteen tubules, situated between the two layers of the broad ligament and in close proximity to the ovary; these constitute what is known as the epodphoron {parovarium or organ of Rosenmiiller). The tubules ter- minate blindly at the ends'nearest the ovary, but at the other extremity, where they are somewhat coiled, they open into a collecting duct which represents the upper end of the Wolffian duct. Near this rudimentary body is another, also composed of tubules, representing the remains of the

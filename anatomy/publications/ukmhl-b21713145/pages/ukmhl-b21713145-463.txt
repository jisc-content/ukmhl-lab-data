449 THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. lumbar regions of the body the central system neurones form distinct cords known as the zvhite rami communicantes (Fig. 242, IVR), which pass from the spinal nerves to the adjacent ganglia of the ganglionated cord, some of them terminating around the cells of these ganglia, others pass- ing on to the cells of the prsevertebral ganglia, and others to those of the peripheral plexuses. In the cervical, lower lumbar and sacral regions white rami are wanting, the cen- tral neurones in the first-named region probably making their way to the sympathetic cells by way of the upper thoracic nerves, while in the lower regions they may pass down the ganglionated cord from higher regions or may join the prsevertebral and peripheral ganglia directly with- out passing through the proximal ganglia. In addition to these white rami, what are known as gray rami also extend between the proximal ganglia and the spinal nerves; these are composed of fibers, arising from sympathetic cells, which join the spinal nerves in order to pass with them to their ultimate distribution. The brief description here given applies especially to the sympathetic system of the neck and trunk. Representa- tives of the system are also found in the head, in the form of a series of ganglia connected with the trigeminus and facial nerves and known as the ciliary, spheno-palatine, otic, and submaxillary ganglia; and, as will be seen later, there are probably some sympathetic cells which owe their origin to the root ganglia of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. There is nothing, however, in the head region cor- responding to the longitudinal bundles of fibers which unite the various proximal ganglia of the trunk to form the gan- glionated cord. The first indications of the sympathetic system are to be seen in a human embryo of about 7 mm. As the spinal nerves reach the level of the dorsal edge of the body-cavity, 39

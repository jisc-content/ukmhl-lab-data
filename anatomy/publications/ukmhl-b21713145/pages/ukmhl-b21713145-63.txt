FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 49 mammalian ovum is uncertain, but if it be applicable it ex- plains the phenomenon of inversion without complicating it with the question of twin-formation. The Formation of the Germ Layers.â€”During the stages which have been described as belonging to the seg- mentation period of development there has been but little differentiation of the cells. In Amphioxns and the am- phibians the cells at one pole of the blastula are larger and more yolk-laden than those at the other pole, and in the mammals an inner cell-mass can be distinguished from the enveloping cells, this latter differentiation having been anticipated in the reptiles and being a differentiation of a portion of the ovum from which alone the embryo will develop from a portion which will give rise to accessory structures. In later stages a differentiation of the inner cell-mass occurs, resulting first of all in the formation of a two-layered or diploblasiic and later of a three-layered or triplohlastic stage. Just as the segmentation has been shown to be profoundly modified by the amount of yolk present in the ovum and by its secondary reduction, so, too, the formation of the three primitive layers is much modified by the same cause, and to get a clear understanding of the formation of the triplo- hlastic condition of the mammal it will be necessary to de- scribe briefly its development in lower forms. In Amphioxus the diploblastic condition results from the flattening of the large-celled pole of the blastula (Fig. 22, A), and^ially from the invagination of this portion of the > ves|cle_within the other portion (Fig. 22, B). The original single-walled blastula in this way becomes converted into a double-walled sac termed a gastnila, the outer layer of wdiich is known as the ectoderm or epiblast and the inner layer as the endoderm or hypoblast. The cavity bounded by the endoderm is the primitive gut or archenteron, and

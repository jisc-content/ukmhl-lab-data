FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 52 cent endoderm. Tliis line of fusion of the three germ layers is known as the primitive streak.. It is convenient to dis- tinguish the mesoderm of the primitive streak from that formed from the dorsal wall of the archenteron by speak- ing of the former as the prostomial and the latter as the gastral mesoderm, though it must be understood that the mes YiG. 24.—Section through a Gastrula of Amblystoma. dl, Dorsal lip of blastopore; gc, digestive cavity; gr, area of mesoderm formation; mes, mesoderm—{EyclesJiymer.) two are continuous immediately in front of the definitive blastopore. In the reptilia still greater modifications are found in the method of formation of the germ layers. Before the enveloping cells have completely surrounded the yolk-mass, a crescentic groove, resembling that occurring in amphibia, appears near the posterior edge of the blastoderm, the cells of which, in front of the groove, arrange themselves in a superficial layer one cell thick, which may be regarded as

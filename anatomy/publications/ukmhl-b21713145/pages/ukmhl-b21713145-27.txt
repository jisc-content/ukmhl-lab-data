13 SPERMATOGENESIS. Spermatogenesis.—The spermatozoa are developed from the cells which line the interior of the seminiferous tubules of the testis. The various stages of development cannot all be seen at any one part of a tubule, but the formation of the spermatozoa seems to pass along each tubule in a wave-like manner and the appearances presented at differ- ent points of the wave may be represented diagrammatically as in Fig. 6. In the first section of this figure four dififerent genera- FiG. 6.—Diagram showing Stages of Spermatogenesis as seen in Different Sectors of a Seminiferous Tubule of a Rat. s, Sertoli cell; sc^, spermatocyte of the first order; sc^, spermatocyte of the second order; sg, spermatogone; sp, spermatid; s::, spermato- zoon.— {Modified from von Lenhossck.) tions of cells are represented; above are mature sperma- tozoa lying in the lumen of the tubule, while next the base- ment membrane is a series of cells from which a new gen- eration of spermatozoa is about to develop. The cells of this series are of two kinds; the larger one {s) will develop into a structure known as a Sertoli cell, while the others are parent cells of spermatozoa and are termed spermatogonia Ug). In the next section the Sertoli cell is seen to have l)ec()mc considerably enlarged, its cytoplasm projecting

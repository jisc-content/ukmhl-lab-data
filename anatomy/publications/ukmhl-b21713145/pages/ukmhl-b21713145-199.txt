OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. 185 ward and forward into the nasal process (Fig. 105, //)), and two lateral masses (Im), situated one on either side in the mesenchyme on the outer side of each olfactory pit. Ossification of the lateral masses or ectethmoids begins rela- tively early, but it appears in the upper part of the median cartilage only after birth, producing the crista galli and the perpendicular plate, which together form what is termed the mcsethmoid. When first formed, the three cartilages are quite separate from one another, the olfactory and nasal nerves passing down between them to the olfactory pit, but later bony trabeculae begin to extend across from the meseth- moid to the upper part of the ectethmoids and eventually form a fenestrated horizontal lamella which ossifies to form the cribri- form plate. The lower part of the median cartilage does not ossify, but a ' BRYO center appears on each side of The shaded parts represent the median line in the mesen- chyme behind and below its pos- terior or lower border. From these centers two vertical bony plates develop which unite by their median surfaces below, and above invest the lower border of the cartilage and form the vomer. The portion of the cartilage which is thus in- vested undergoes resorption, but the more anterior portions persist to form the cartilaginous septum of the nose. The vomer, consequently, is not really a portion of the chondro- cranium, but is a membrane bone; its intimate relations with the median ethmoidal cartilage, however, make it conveni- ent to consider it in this place. 17 Fig. 105.—Anterior Portion OF THE Base of the Skull OF A 6 TO 7 Months' En- car- tilage, cp, Cribriform plate; Im, lateral mass of the eth- moid ; Ip, perpendicular plate ; of, optic foramen; os, orbito- sphenoid.—{After von Spec.)

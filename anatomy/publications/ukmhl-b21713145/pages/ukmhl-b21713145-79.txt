The lining membrane of the serous cavities of the body. 5. The kidneys and ureters. 6. The internal organs of reproduction. From this list it will be seen that the products of the mesoderm are more varied than those of either of the other layers. Among its products are organs in which in either the embryonic or adult condition the cells are arranged in a definite layer, while in other structures its cells are scat- tered in a matrix of non-cellular material, as, for example, in the connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and the blood and lymph. It has been proposed to distinguish these two forms of mesoderm as mesothcliuni and niescnch\mte respectively, a distinction which is undoubtedly convenient, though prob- ably devoid of the fundamental importance which has been attributed to it by some embryologists.

THE FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM. 34 It seems to be a rule that but one spermatozoon pene- trates the ovum. Many, of course, come into contact with it and endeavor to penetrate it, but so soon as one has been successful in its endeavor no further penetration of others occurs. The reasons for this are in most cases obscure; experiments on the ova of invertebrates have shown that the subjection of the ova to abnormal conditions which impair their vitality favors the penetration of more than a single spermatozoon {polyspermy), and, indeed, it appears that in some forms, such as the common newt {Diemycty- lus), polyspermy is the rule, only one of the spermatozoa, however, which have penetrated uniting with the female pronucleus, the rest being absorbed by the cytoplasm of the ovum. Fertilization marks the beginning of development, and it is therefore important that something should be known as to where and when it occurs. It seems probable that in the human species the spermatozoa usually come into contact with the ovum and fertilization ensues in the upper part of the Fallopian tubes, and the occurrence of extra- uterine pregnancy (see p. 21) seems to indicate that occa- sionally the ovum may be fertilized even before it has been received into the tube. It is evident, then, that when fertilization is accomplished the spermatozoon must have traveled a distance of about twenty-four centimeters, the length of the upper part of the vagina being taken to be about 5 cm., that of the uterus as 7 cm., and that of the tube as 12 cm. A considerable interval of time is required for the completion of this jour- ney, even though the movement of the spermatozoon be tolerably rapid. The observations of Henle and Hensen indicate that a spermatozoon may progress in a straight line at about the rate of from 1.2 to 2.7 mm. per minute, while Lott finds the rate to be as high as 3.6 mm.

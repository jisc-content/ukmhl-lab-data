4/2 THE MIDDLE EAR. has been held to be a derivative of the mesenchyme from which the periotic capsule is formed. In later stages, how- ever, it becomes connected with the cartilage of the second branchial arch, as shown in Fig. 255, and it is a question whether this connection, which is transitory, does not really indicate the phylogenetic origin of the ossicle from the sec- ond arch cartilage, its appearance as an independent struc- FiG. 255.—Semi-diagrammatic View of the Auditory Ossicles of an Embryo of Six Weeks. i.

However that may be, the stapedial artery disappears in later stages and the_ stapedius nmsclt,. dti'ived from the musculature, of the second branchial arch and therefore supplied by._the facial nerve, becomes attached to the ossicle. The three ossicles at first lie embedded in the mesenchyme forming the roof of the ^primitive tympanic cavity, as does also the chorda tympani, a branch of the seventh nerve, as

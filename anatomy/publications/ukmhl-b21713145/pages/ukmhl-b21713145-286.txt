2/2 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. itself becoming the distal portion, the middle cerebral vein becomes the superior petrosal sinus, while the anterior cerebral vein persists as the middle cerebral vein of adult anatomy (Fig. 151, C). Additional sprouts from the terminal portion of the superior sagittal sinus give rise to the straight and inferior sagittal sinuses, and, after the disappearance of the vena capitis lateralis, a new stem devel- ops between the cavernous and transverse sinuses, passing medial to the ear vesicle, and forms the inferior petrosal sinus (Fig. L51, C). This joins the transverse sinus at the jugular foramen and from this junction onwards the anterior cardinal vein may now be termed the internal jugu- lar vein. Passing backward from the jugular foramen the internal jugular veins unite with the posterior cardinals to form on each side a common trunk, the ductus Cuvieri, and then passing transversely toward the median line open into the sides of the sinus venosus. So long as the heart retains its original position in the pharyngeal region the jugular is a short trunk receiving lateral veins only from the upper- most segments of the neck and from the occipital segments, the remaining segmental veins opening into the inferior cardinals. As the heart recedes, however, the jugulars become more and more elongated and the cervical lateral veins shift their communication from the cardinals to the jugulars, until, when the subclavians have thus shifted, the jugulars become much larger than the cardinals. When the sinus venosus is absorbed into the wall of the right auricle, the course of the left Cuvierian duct becomes a little longer than that of the right, and from the left jugu- lar, at the point where it is joined by the left subclavian, "atranch arises which extends obliquely across to join the right jugular, forming the left innominate vein. When this is established, the connection between the left jugular

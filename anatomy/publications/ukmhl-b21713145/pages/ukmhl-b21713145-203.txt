OSSIFICATION OF BRANCHIAL ARCH SKELETON. 189 fication, which then disappears and the thickenings unite to form the adult bone, though occasionally one or more of their lines of union may persist, prcJducing a bipartite or tripartite zygomatic. The vomer, which has already been described, belongs also strictly to the category of membrane bones, as do also the maxillae and the palatines; these latter, however, pri- marily belonging to the branchial arch skeleton, with which they will be considered. The purely membrane bones in the skull, are, then, the following: Interparietals, Part of squamous portion of occipital. Squamosals, Squamous portions of tem- porals. Tympanies, Tympanic plates of temporals. Parietals. Frontal. Nasals. Lachrymals. , j Zygomatics. Vomer. The Ossification of the Branchial Arch Skeleton.â€”It has been seen (p. i8o) that a cartilaginous bar develops only in the mandibular process of the first branchial arch. In the maxillary process no cartilaginous skeleton forms, but two membrane bones, the palatine and maxilla, are devel- oped in it, their cartilaginous representatives, which are to be found in lower vertebrates, having been suppressed by a condensation of the development. The palatine bone develops from a single center of ossification, but for each maxilla no less than five centers have been described (Fig. 107). One of these gives rise to so much of the alveolar border of the bone as contains the bicuspid and molar teeth, a second forms the nasal process and the part of the alveo- lar border which contains the canine tooth; a third the por- tion which contains the incisor teeth; while the fourth and

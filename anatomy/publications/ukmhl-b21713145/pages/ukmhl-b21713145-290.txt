276 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. omphalo-mesenteric; this is the ductus venosus (Fig. 153, B, DVA). In the meantiiiTe three cross-connections h^ye developed between the two omphalo-mesenteric veins, two of which pass ventral and the other dorsal to the intestine, so that the latter is surrounded by two venous loops (Fig. 154, A), and a connection is developed between each um- bilical vein and the corresponding omphalo-mesenteric (Fig. 153, B), that of the left side being the larger and uniting with the omphalo-mesenteric just where it is joined by the Fig 1S4—A, The Venous Trunks of an Embryo of 5 mm. seen from THE Ventral Surface; B, Diagram Illustrating the Trans- formation TO THE Adult Condition.

When these connections are com- plete, the upper portions of the umbilical veins degenerate (Fig. 154), and now the right side of the lower of the two omphalo-mesenteric loops which surround the intestine dis-

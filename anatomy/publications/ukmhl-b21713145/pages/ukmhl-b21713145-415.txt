THE HISTOGENESIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 4OI mv of two well-defined zones, an inner one immediately sur- rounding the central canal and composed of the indifferent cells and the bodies of the supportive or ependymal cells, and an outer one consisting of the branched prolongations of the ependymal cells. This outer layer is termed the m-Ql'giliciI vehmi .(R^ndschleier) (Fig. 220, mv). The in- different cells now be- gin to wander outward to form a definite layer, termed the man- tle layer J lying between the marginal velum and the bodies of the ependymal cells (Fig. 221), and when this layer has become well established the cells composing it begin to divide and to differen- tiate into (i) cells termed neuroblasts, destined to become nerve-cells, and (2) others which appear to be supportive in charac- ter and are termed neu- roglia cells (Fig. 221, B). The latter are for the most part small and have their cell-bodies drawn out into very numerous and exceedingly slender processes, which ramify among the neuroblasts, these, on the other hand, being larger and each early developing a single strong process which grows out nito the marginal velum and is known as an avis- os Fig. 220.—Ependymal Cells from the Spinal Cord of an Embryo of 4.25 MM. mv, Marginal velum.—(i/w.)

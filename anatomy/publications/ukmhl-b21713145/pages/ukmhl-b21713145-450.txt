THE CRANIAL NERVES. 436 The conditions just described are those which obtain throughout the greater part of the thoracic region. Else- where the fibers of the ventral divisions of the nerves as they grow outward tend to separate from one another and to become associated with the fibers of adjacent nerves, giving rise to plexuses. In the regions where the limbs occur the formation of the plexuses is also associated with a shifting of the parts to which the nerves are supplied, a factor in plexus formation which is, however, much more evident from comparative anatomical than from embryo- logical studies. The Development of the Cranial Nerves.â€”During the last thirty years the cranial nerves have received a great deal of attention in connection with the idea that an accu- rate knowledge of their development would afTord a clue to a most vexed problem of vertebrate morphology, the metamerism of the head. That the metamerism which was so pronounced in the trunk should extend into the head was a natural supposition, strengthened by the discovery of head-cavities in the lower vertebrates and by the indica- tions of metamerism seen in the branchial arches, and the problem which presented itself was the correlation of the various structures belonging to each metamere and the de- termination of the modifications which they had undergone during the evolution of the head. In the trunk region a nerve forms a conspicuous element of each metamere and is composed, according to what is known as Bell's law, of a ventral or efferent and a dorsal or afferent root. Until comparatively recently the study of the cranial nerves has been dominated by the idea that it was possible to extend the application of Bell's law to them and to recognize in the cranial region a number of nerve pairs serially homologous with the spinal nerves, some of them, however, having lost their afferent roots, while in

394 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPRARENAL BODIES. the separation of the two tissues and their liistological dif- ferentiation is complete, occasional masses of interrenal tis- sue remaining- imbedded in the medullary substance and an immigration, of sympathetic cells continuing until at least t_he tenth year (WieselV ~ ' A great deal of difference of opinion has existed in the past concernmg the origin of the suprarenal glands. By several authors they have been regarded as derivatives in whole or in part of the excretory apparatus, some tracing their origin to the mesonephros and others even to the pronephros. The fact Fig. 217.—Section through the Suprarenal Body of an Embryo OF 17 MM. A, Aorta; R. interrenal portion; S, sympathetic nervous system; SB, sympathetic cells penetrating the interrenal portion.— (Wiescl.) that in some mammals the cortical (interrenal) cells are formed from the bottom of depressions of the ccelomic epi- thelium seemed to lend support to this view, but it is now pretty firmly established that the appearances thus presented do not warrant the interpretation placed upon them and that the interrenal tissue is derived from the coeloinic epithelium quite independently of the nephric tubules. That the chromaf- fine tissue is a derivative of the sympathetic nervous system has long been recognized. During the development of the suprarenal glands por-

CHAPTER VII. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUES AND SKELETON. It has been seen that the cells of a very considerable por- tion of the somatic and splanchnic mesoderm, as well as of parts of the mesodermic somites, become converted into mesenchyme. A very considerable portion of this becomes converted into what are termed connective or supporting tissues, characterized by consisting of a non-cellular matrix in which more or less scattered cells are embedded. These tissues enter to a greater or less extent into the formation of all the organs of the body, with the exception of those forming the central nervous system, and constitute a net- work which holds together and supports the elements of which the organs are composed; in addition, they take the form of definite membranes (serous membranes, fasciae), cords (tendons, ligaments), or solid masses (cartilage), or form looser masses or layers of a somewhat spongy texture (areolar tissue). The intermediate substance is somewhat varied in character, being composed sometimes of white, non-branching, non-elastic fibers, sometimes of yellow, branching, elastic fibers; of white, branching, but inelastic fibers which form a reticulum, or of a soft gelatinous sub- stance containing considerable quantities of mucin, as in the tissue which constitutes the Whartonian jelly of the umbili- cal cord. Again, in cartilage the matrix is compact and homogeneous, or, in other cases, more or less fibrous, pass- ing over into ordinary fibrous tissue, and, finally, in bone the organic matrix is largely impregnated with salts of lime.

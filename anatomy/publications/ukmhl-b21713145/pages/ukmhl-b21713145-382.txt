368 THE METANEPHROS. beginsJo_dongate (Fig. 205, C), growing toward the hilus of the kidney, parallel to the branch of the outgrowth from the Wolffian duct to which it is attached and between this and the glomerulus, and forms a loop of Henle. From the portion of the horizontal limb of the S which lies between the glon^erulus and the descending limb of the loop of Henle" the proximal convoluted tubule ..(C) arises, while the distal_ convoluted and the arched collecting tubules (C and A) are formed from the uppermost portion of the upper loop (Fig. 205, D). The entire length of the urinary tubule from Bowman's capsule to the arched collecting tube inclusive is thus de- rived from a renal vesicle, while each renal ampulla becomes by its elongation a collecting tubule and the remaining por- tions of the outgrowth from the Wolffian duct become the pelvis of the kidney and the ureter. Up to the time when the urinary tubules begin to develop there is no pelvis to the kidney, the ureter extending well toward the center of the blastema before beginning to branch and the branches thence extending to the cortex (Fig. 204). As soon as the tubules appear, however, the formation of the pelvis begins by what has been described as an evagination of the primary branches of the ureter to form a common cavity, a process which is beginning to manifest itself in the stage shown in Fig. 204, B, and which is continued until the secondary branches are also taken up into the cavity, into which the various collecting tubules then open separately. At about the tenth week of development the surface of the human kidney becomes marked by shallow depressions into lobes, of which there are about eighteen, one corre- sponding to each of the groups of tubules which arise from the same renal vesicle. This lobatipn persists until after birth and then disappears completely, the surface of the kidney becoming smooth.

I/O DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRAE. out which represent the future transverse and articular processes. The fusion of the cartilage of the costal process with the body of the vertebra does not, however, persist. Later a solution of the junction occurs and the process becomes a rib cartilage, the mesenchyme surrounding the area of solu- tion forming the costo-vertebral ligaments. At first the rib cartilage is separated by a distinct interval from the trans- verse process of the vertebral arch, but later it develops a process, the tubercle, which bridges the gap and forms an articulation with the transverse process. The mesenchyme which extends between successive ver- tebral arches does not chondrify, but later becomes trans- formed into the interspinous ligaments and the ligamenta flava, while the anterior and posterior longitudinal liga- ments are formed from unchondrified portions of the tissue surrounding the vertebral bodies. As was pointed out, the mesenchyme in the region of the cleft separating the anterior and posterior portions of a sclerotome becomes an intervertebral fibrocartilage, and, as the cartilaginous bodies develop, the portions of the noto- chord enclosed by them become constricted, while at the same time the portions in the intervertebral regions increase in size. Finally the notochord disappears from the verte- bral regions, although a canal, representing its former posi- tion, traverses each body for a considerable time, and in the intervertebral regions it persists as relatively large flat disks forming the pulpy nuclei of the fibrocartilages. The mode of development described above applies to the great majority of the vertebrae, but some departures from it occur, and these may be conveniently considered before passing on to an account of the ossification of the carti- lages. The variations affect principally the extremes of the series. Thus the posterior vertebrae present a reduction of

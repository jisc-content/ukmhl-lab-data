FORMATION OF THE GERM LAYERS. 51 mp 23.â€”Transverse Section of 24, gc), the roof of which is composed of relatively small yoik-containiiig cells while its floor is formed by the large cells of the lower pole of the blastula. The cavity of the blastula is not sufficiently large to allow of the typical in- vagination of all these large cells, so that they become enclosed by the rapid growth of the ecto- derm cells of the upper pole of the ovum over them. Before this growth takes place the blastopore corresponds to the entire area occupied by the large yolk cells, but later, as the growth of the smaller cells gradually encloses Amphioxus Embryo with Five . Mesodermic Pouches. the larger ones, it be- ^j^^ Notochord; d, digestive cavity; comes smaller and is ec, ectoderm; cn, endoderm; m, finally represented by a small opening situated at what will be the hind end of the embryo. Soon after the archenteron has been formed a solid plate of cells, eventually splitting into two layers, arises from its roof on each side of the median line and grows out into the space between the ectoderm and endoderm (Fig. 25, ink^ and mk^), evidently corresponding to the hollow plates formed in the same situations in Amphioxus. This is not, however, the only source of the mesoderm in the amphibia, for while the blastopore is still quite large there may be found surrounding it between the endoderm and ectoderm a ring of mesodermal tissue (Fig. 24, mes). As the blas- topore diminishes in size and its lips come together and unite, the ring of mesoderm forms first an oval and then a band lying beneath the line of closure of the blastopore and united with both the superjacent ectoderm and the subja-

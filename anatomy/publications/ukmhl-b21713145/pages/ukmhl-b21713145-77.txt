If these results be regarded as applicable to the human embryo, then it mav be supposed that in this the head region is devel- oped from'the portion of the embryonic disk situated in front A BCD Fig. 34.—Diagrams Illustrating the Relations of the Chick Embryo to the Primitive Streak at Different Stages of De- velopment.— (Peebles.) of Hensen's node, while the entire trunk is a product of the region occupied by the node. The Significance of the Germ Layers.—The formation of the three germ layers is a process of fundamental impor- • tance, sincejt^s_a differentiation, o£ the cell units of the ovum into tissues which have definite tasks to fulfil. As has been seen, the first stage in the development of the layers is the formation of the ectoderm and endoderm, or, if the physiological nature of the layers be considered, it is the differentiation of a layer, the endoderm, which has

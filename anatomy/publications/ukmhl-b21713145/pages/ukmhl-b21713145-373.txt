Since the nerve which corresponds to these arches is the vagus, the supply of the larynx is derived from that nerve, the superior laryngeal nerve probably cor- responding to the fourth arch, while the inferior (recurrent) answers to the fifth. The course nf the rernrrent nerve fiiids its explanatioii_in I the relation of the nerve to the fourth branchial artery." When \^ the heart occupies its primary position ventral to the floor of the pharynx, the inferior laryngeal nerve passes transversely inward to the larynx beneath the fourth branchial artery. As_ the heart recedes the nerve is caught by the vessel and is car- ried back with it,. tHe portion of the vagus between it and the superior laryngeal nerve elongating until the origins of the two laryngeal nerves are separated by the entire length of the neck. Hence it is that the right recurrent nerve bends upward behind the right subclavian artery, while the left curves beneath the arch of the aorta (see Fig. 143). LITERATURE. J. M.

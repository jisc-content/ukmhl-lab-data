On the rupture of the follicle a considerable portion of the stratum granulosum remains in place, and usually there is an effusion of a greater or less amount of blood from the vessels of the theca interna into stance having suggested the name corpus luteum which is now applied to it. In later stages there is a gradual increase in the amount of connective tissue present and a corresponding diminu- tion of the lutein cells, the corpus luteum gradually losing its yellow color and becoming converted into a whitish, fibrous, scar-like body, the corpus albicans, which may event- ually almost completely disappear. These various changes occur in every ruptured follicle, whether or not the ovum which was contained in it be fertilized. But the rapidity with which the various stages of retrogression ensue differs greatly according to whether pregnancy occurs or not, and it is customary to distinguish the corpora lutea which are associated with pregnancy as corpora lutea vera from those whose ova fail to be fertilized and which form corpora lutea AFTER Menstruation. d, Blood-clot; f, Graafian follicle; th, theca.—(Kollmaitii.)

The split in the wall through which the ovum escaped soon closes over and the cavity becomes filled with cells separated into groups by trabeculae of connective tissue containing blood- vessels (Fig. 12). These cells contain a consider- able amount of a peculiar yellow pigment known as lutein, the color imparted to the follicle by this sub-

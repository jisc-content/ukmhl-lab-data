THE CRANIAL NERVES. 445 accessory nerve occurs. Since this nerve represents a cranial lateral motor root the temptation is great to regard the cranial lateral motor roots as equivalent to the white rami of the cord, and this temptation is intensified when it is recalled that there are both embryological and topographical reasons for regarding the branchiomeric muscles, to which the cranial lateral motor nerves are supplied, as equivalent to the visceral muscles of the trunk. But in view of the fact that a sympathetic neurone is always interposed between a white ramus fiber and the visceral musculature, while the, lateral motor fibers connect directly with the branchiomeric musculature, it seems advisable to await further studies before yielding to the temptation. As regards the actual development of the cranial nerves, they follow the general law which obtains for the spinal nerves, the motor fibers being outgrowths from neuroblasts situated in the walls of the neural tube, while the sensory nerves are outgrowths from the cells of ganglia situated without the tube. In the lower vertebrates a series of gan- glia, known as the suprabranchial ganglia, are developed from the ectoderm along a line corresponding with the level of the auditory invagination, while on a line corresponding with the upper extremities of the branchial clefts another series occurs which has been termed that of the epibranchial ganglia, and with both of these sets the cranial nerves are in connection. In the mammalia these structures have not yet been sufficiently studied, but from the general relation- ship of the suprabranchial ganglia it seems probable that they are associated with the lateral line nerves and are con- sequently represented in the mammalia only by the ganglia of the auditory nerve. From what has been said above it is clear that the usual arrangement of the cranial nerves in twelve pairs does not rep- resent their true relationships with one another. The various pairs are serially homologous neither with one another nor

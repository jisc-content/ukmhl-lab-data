SPERMATOGENESIS. 15 more or less closely united to form a tetrad. During the mitosis each tetrad divides into two dyads, one of which passes into each secondary spermatocyte, and these cells undergoing- division without the usual reconstruction of the nucleus, each of the dyads which they contain is halved. Fig. 7.â€”^DiAGRAM Illustrating the Reduction of the Chromo- somes During Spermatogenesis. sc^, Spermatocyte of the first order; sc', spermatocyte of the second order; sp, spermatid. SO that each spermatid receives a number of single chromo- 1 somes equal to half the number characteristic for the species. / ^ This reduction of the chromosomes of the germ cells may be understood from the annexed diagram (Fig. 7), which represents the spermatogenesis of a form whose somatic cells are supposed to contain eight chromosomes.

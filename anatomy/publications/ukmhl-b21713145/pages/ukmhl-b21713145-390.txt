A somewhat similar fate is shared by the medullary cords, these also breaking up into a number of follicles, but sooner or later these follicles undergo degeneration so that shortly after birth practically no traces of the cords remain. It must be noted that degeneration of the follicles formed from the cortical layer also takes place even during fetal life and continues to occur throughout the entire periods of growth and functional activity, nu- merous atretic follicles Fig. 210.—Section of the Ovary of a New-born Child. a, Ovarial epithelium; b, proximal part of a Pfluger's cord; c, sex-cell in being found m the ovary epithelium; d and e, spherical masses; f, primary follicle; g, blood-vessel.— (From Gegenhaiir, after Waldeyer.) at all times. Indeed it would seem that degen- eration is the fate of the great majority of the follicles and sex-cells of the ovary, but few ova coming to maturity during the life-time of any individual. Rete-cords developed from the rete portion of the germ- inal ridge occur in connection with the ovary as well as with the testis and form a rete ovarii. They do not, however, extend so deeply into the ovary, remaining in the neighbor- hood of the mesovarium, and they do not become tubular,

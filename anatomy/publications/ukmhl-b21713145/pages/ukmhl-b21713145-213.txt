199 DEVELOPMENT OF THE JOINTS. The Development of the Joints.â€”The mesenchyme which primarily represents each vertebra, or the skull, or the skeleton of a limb, is at first a continuous mass, and when it becomes converted into cartilage this also may be continuous, as in the skull, or may appear as a number of distinct parts united by unmodified portions of the mesen- chyme. In the former case the various ossifications as they extend will come into contact with their neighbors and will either fuse with them or will articulate with them directly, forming a suture. When, however, a portion of unmodified mesenchyme intervenes between two cartilages, the mode of articulation of the bones formed from these cartilages will vary. The intermediate mesenchyme may in time undergo chondrifi- cation and unite the bones in an almost immovable articu- lation known as a synchondrosis {e. g., the sacroiliac articu- lation) ; or a cavity may appear in the center of the inter- vening cartilage so that a slight amount of movement of the two bones is possible, forming an amphiarthrosis (e. g., the symphysis pubis) ; or, finally, the intermediate mesen- chyme may not chondrify, but its peripheral portions may become converted into a dense sheath of connective tissue (Fig. 112, c) which surrounds the adjacent ends of the two bones like a sleeve, forming the articular capsule, while the central portions degenerate to form a cavity. The bones which enter into such an articulation are more or less freely movable upon one another and the joint is termed a diar- throsts {e. g., the knee- or shoulder-joint). In a diarthrosis the connective-tissue cells near the inner surface of the capsule arrange themselves in a layer to form a synovial membrane for the joint, and portions of the cap- sule may thicken to form special bands, the reinforcing ligaments, while other strong fibrous bands, which may pass from one bone to the other, forming accessoi-y ligaments,

THE HISTOGENESIS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 403 is only partly closed (Fig, 42), the cells which lie along the line of transition between the lips of the groove and the general ectoderm form a distinct ridge readily recognized in sections and termed the neural crest (Fig. 222, A). When the lips of the groove fuse together the cells of the crest unite to form a wedge-shaped mass, completing the closure of the canal (Fig. 222, B), and later proliferate so as to. extend outward over the surface of the canal (Fig. 222, C). Since this proliferation is most ac- tive in the regions of the crest which correspond to the mesodermic somites there is formed a series of cell masses, arranged segmentally and situated in the mesenchyme at the sides of the medullary canal (Fig. 206). These cell-masses represent the dorsal root_£an£lia, and certain of their constitu- ent cells, which may also be termed neuroblasts. Fig. 222.—Three Sections through THE Medullary Canal of an Em- bryo OF 2.S Mu.~(vo7i Lenhossek.) early assume a fusiform shape and send out a process from each extremity. One of these processes, the axis-cylinder, grows inward toward the medullary canal and penetrates its marginal velum, and, after a longer or shorter course in this zone, enters the mantle layer and comes into contact with the dendrites of some of the central neuroblasts. The other process extends peripherally and is to be regarded extremely elongated dendrite. The processes from the cells of each ganglion

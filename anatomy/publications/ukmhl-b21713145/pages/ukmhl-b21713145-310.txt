296 CHAPTER X. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND GLANDS. The greatest portion of the digestive tract is jormed by the constriction off .of. the dorsal portion of the yolk-sac, as shown in Fig. 39, the result being the formation of a cylinder, closed at either end, and composed of a layer of splanchnic mesoderm lined on its inner surface_by_endQ- derm. Tliis cylinder_2^_termed^ the arrhpntpmn and has connected with it the yolk-stalk and the allantois. thejatter communicating with its somewhat dilated terminal portion. which cilso receives the ducts of the primitive kidneys and, is known as the cloaca (Fig. 163). At a very early stage of development the anterior end of the embryo begins to project slightly inftwt_jDÂ£^ the yolk-sac, so that a ^hallow depression is formed between the two structures. As the constriction of tKe~eml5ryq f foTp' the sac proceeds, the anterior portion of the brain becomes bent ventrally and the heart makes its appearance immedi- ately in front of the anterior surface of the yolk-sac, and so the depression mentioned above becomes deepened (Fig. 162) to form the oral sinus. The floor of this, lined by ectoderm, is immediately opposite the anterior end oOhe archenteron, and, since mesoderm does not develop in _this region, the ectoderm of the sinus and the endoderm ofjhe archenteron are directly in contact, forming a thin pharyn-^ geal membrane separating the two cavities (Fig. 162, pm). in embryos of 2.15 mm. this membrane is still existent, but soon after it becomes perforated_and finally disappears, so that the archenteron and oral sinus become continuous.

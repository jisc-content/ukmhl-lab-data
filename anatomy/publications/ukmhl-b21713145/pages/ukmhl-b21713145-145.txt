THE CHORIONIC VILLI. the uterus, the fixation villi becoming connected with these septa as well as with the general uterine wall. The ecto- derm of the villi also undergoes certain changes with ad- vancing growth, the layer of Langhans cells disappearing except in small areas scattered irregularly in the villi, and the syncytium, though persisting, undergoes local thicken- ings which become replaced, more or less extensively, by depositions of fibrin (Fig.-^,?B, cf). The changes which occur during the later stages of devel- FiG. 70.—Mature Placenta after Separation from the Uterus. c, Cotyledons; ch, chorion, amnion, and dccidua vera; um, umbilical cord.— ( Kollmann.) opment in the chorion are very similar to those described for the villi. Thus, the mesoderm thickens, its outermost layers becoming exceedingly fibrillar in structure, while the ectoderm differentiates into two layers, the outer of which is syncytial while the inner is cellular, and later still, as in the villi, the syncytial layer is replaced in irregular patches by a peculiar form of fibrin which is traversed by flattened anastomosing spaces and to which Minot has ap- plied the name cmuilized fibrin (Fig. 71).

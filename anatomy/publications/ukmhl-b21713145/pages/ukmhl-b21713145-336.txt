322 THE INTESTINE. abdomen, crossing^in front of the duodennm and having the remaniing portion of the small intestine below it. The elongation continuing, the secondary coils of the small in- testine become more numerous and the lower portion of the large intestine is thrown_into _a looÂ£ which extends trans- versely across the lower part of the abdominal cavity and represents the sigmoid flexure of the colon. At the time of birth this portion of the large intestine is relatively much longer than in the adult, amounting to nearly^half the entire length of the colon (Treves), but after the fourth month after birth a readjustment of the relative lengths of the parts of the colon occurs, the sigmoid flexure becoming shorter and the rest of the colon proportionally longer, whereby the^cum is pushed downward until it lies in the right iliac fossa, the ascending colon being thus established. When this condition has been reached, the duodenum, after passing downward for a short distance so as to pass dorsally to the transverse colon, bends toward the left and the secondary coils derived from the second and third pri- mary coils come to occupy the left upper portion of the abdominal cavity. Those from the fourth primary coil pass across the middle line and occupy the right upper part of the abdomen, those from the fifth cross back again to the left lumbar and iliac regions, and those of the sixth take possession of the false pelvis and the right iliac region (Fig. i78)r~" - Slight variations from this arrangement are not infrequent, but it occurs with sufficient frequency to be regarded as the normal. A failure in the readjustment of the relative lengths of the different parts of the colon may also occasionally occur, in which case the caecum will retain its embryonic position beneath the liver. The yolk-stalk is continuous with the intestine at_the extremity of the loop which extends"^it into the umMlical coelom, and when the primary coils become apparent its

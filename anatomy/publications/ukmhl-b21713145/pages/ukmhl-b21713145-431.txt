THE CEREBELLUM. The cerebellum is formed from the dorsal zones and_roof- plate of the metencephalon and is a thickening of the tissue immediatelY_ anterior to the front edge of the posterior veluiTi. This latter structure has in early stages a rhom- boidal shape (Fig. 229, A) which causes the cerebellar thickening to appear at first as if composed of two lateral portions inclined obliquely toward one another. In reality, however, the thickening extends entirely across the roof of the brain (Fig. 229, B), the roof-plate probably being invaded by cells from the .dor§g.l zones and so giving rise to the vermis, while the lobes are formed directly from the dorsal zones. During the second month a groove appears Fig. 229.—.4, Dorsal View of the Brain of a Rabbit Embryo of 16 MM.; B, Median Longitudinal Section of a Calf Embryo of 3 cm. c. Cerebellum; m, m'id-hva'm.— (Mihalkovic2.) on the ventral surface of each lobe, marking out an area which becomes the iiocculus, and later, during the third month, transverse furrows appear upon the vermis dividing it into five lobes, and later still extend out upon the lobes and increase in number to produce the lamellate structure characteristic of the cerebellum. The histogenetic development of the cerebellum at first proceeds along the lines which have already been described as typical, but after the development of the mantle layer the cells lining the greater portion of the cavity of the ventricle cease to multiply, only those which are situated

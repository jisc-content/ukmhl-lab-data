CHAPTER XIIL THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE URINOGENITAL SYSTEM. The excretory and reproductive systems of organs are so closely related in their development that they must be considered together. Tliey both owe their origin to the mesoderm which constitutes the intermediate cell-mass (p. 104), this, at an early period of development, becom- ing thickened so as to form a ridge projecting into the .'Ct Fig. 200.—Transverse Section through the Abdominal Region of A Rabbit Embryo of 12 mm. a, Aorta; gl., glomerulus; gr, genital ridge; m. mesentery; nc, noto- chord; t, tubule of mesonephros; zvd, Wolffian duct; zvr, Wolffian ridge.— {Mihalkovicz.) dorsal portion of the coelom and forming what is known as the Wolffian ridge (Fig. 200, zvr). The greater portion of the substance of this ridge is concerned in the develop- ment of the primary and secondary excretory organs, but on its mesial surface a second ridge appears which is des- tined to give rise to the ovary or testis, and hence is termed the genital ridge {gr). ^60

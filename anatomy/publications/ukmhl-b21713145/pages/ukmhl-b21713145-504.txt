490 THE RETINA. with which they are mingled, hut it is heheved that they are represented by cells which are bipolar when the rod and cone cells are still in a unipolar condition (Fig. 266, e). If this identification be correct, then it is noteworthy that at first their outer processes extend as far as the external limiting membrane and must later shorten or fail to elon- gate until their outer ends lie in what is termed the outer Fig. 266.—Diagram showing the Development of the Retinal a, Cone cell in the unipolar, and b, in the bipolar stage; c, rod cells in the unipolar, and d, in the bipolar stage; e, bipolar cells; f and t, amacrine cells; g, horizontal cells; h, ganglion cells; k,^ Miiller s fiber; I, external limiting membrane—{Kallius, after Cajal.) granular layer of the retina, where they stand in relation to the inner ends of the rod and cone cell processes. Of the development of the amacrine (/, i) and horizontal cells {g) of the retina little is known. From their position in new-born kittens it seems probable that the former are

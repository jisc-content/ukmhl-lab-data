1/4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRA AND RIBS. Each rib ossifies from a single primary center situated near the angle, secondary centers appearing for the capit- ulum and tuberosity. In some of the vertebrae modifications of this typical mode of ossification, occur. Thus, in the upper five cervi- cal vertebrae the centers for the rudimentary ribs are sup- pressed, ossification extending into them from the vertebral arch centers, and a similar suppression of the costal centers occurs in the lower lumbar vertebra, the first only develop- ing a separate rib center. Furthermore, in the atlas a c Fig. 97—Upper Surface of the First Sacral Vertebra, and B, Ventral View of the Sacrum showing Primary Centers of Ossification. c, Body; na, vertebral arch; r, rib center.—(5"a/'/'t?3'.) double center appears in the persisting hypochordal bar, and the body which corresponds to the atlas, after developing the terminal epiphysial disks, fuses with the body of the epistropheus (axis) to form its odontcid process, this ver- tebra consequently possessing, in addition to the typical cen- ters, one (double) other primary and two secondary cen- ters. In the sacral region the typical centers appear in all five vertebrae, with the exception of rib centers for the last one or two (Fig. 97) and two additional secondary centers

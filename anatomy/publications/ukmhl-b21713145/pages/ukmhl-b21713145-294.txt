DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. 28o in this form the process is somewhat different from what obtains in the rabbit. The differences depend principally upon the greater development of the supracardinal veins, these vessels extending far anterior to the subcardinal cross- connection, and forming the dorsal limb of a very wide ureteric venous ring (Fig. 156, A). During development the two supracardinal limbs of the ureteric ring approach Pig 156â€”Diagrams Illustrating the Development of the Inferior Vena Cava in the Cat.

The complicated development of the inferior vena cava nat- urally gives rise to numerous anomalies of the vein due to

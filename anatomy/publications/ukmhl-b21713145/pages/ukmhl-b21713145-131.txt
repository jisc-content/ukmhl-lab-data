THE AMNION. 117 along- an oblique line joining these two points (Fig. 63, B and C, in which the attachment of the amnion is indicated by the broken line). Leaving aside for the present the changes which occur in the attachment of the amnion to the embryo (see p. 123), it may be said that during the later growth of the embryo the amniotic cavity increases in size until finally its wall comes into contact with the chorion, the extra- ernbryonic body-cavity being thus practically obliterated (Fig. 63, D), thoug-h no actual fusion of amnion and chorion | ^ occurs. Suspended by the umbilical cord, which has by this time developed, the embryo floats freely in the amniotic cavity, which is filled by a fluid, the liquor amnii, whose origin is involved in doubt, some authors maintaining that it infiltrates into the cavity from the maternal tissues, while others hold that a certain amount of it at least is derived from the embryo. It is a fluid with a specific gravity of about 1.003 ^^'^^ contains about i per cent, of solids, prin- cipally albumin, grape-sugar, and urea, the last constituent probably coming from the embryo. When present in great- est quantity,—that is to say, at about the beginning of the ' last month of pregnancy,—it varies in amount between one- half and three-fourths of a liter, but during the last month it diminishes to about half that quantity. To protect the epidermis of the fetus from maceration during its prolonged immersion in the liquor amnii, the sebaceous glands of the skin at about the sixth month of development pour out upon the surface of the body a white fatty secretion known as the vernix caseosa. During parturition the amnion, as a rule, ruptures as the result of the contraction of the uterine walls and the liquor amnii escape as the "waters," a phenomenon which nor- mally precedes the delivery of the child. As a rule, the rup- ture is sufficiently extensive to allow the passage of the child.

The relations of the broad ligaments and mesorchia in the male become profoundly modified by the descent of the testes into the scrotum, a process to be described later (p. 388). From each genital ridge a prolongation, of mesenchyme extends ■ downward in the mesentery' of the ridge, nearly parallel with the Miillerian duct, with which it comes into contact at the point where the two ducts fuse and thence is con- tinued downward and for- ward between the folds of the broad ligament to be attached i to the ventral wall of the" abdomen in the inguinal region. The upper part of this pro-j longation of the genital ridge' represents the ligament of the'^ ovary and its lower part the! ligamentum teres of the female] (Fig. 207), while in the male the entire structure forms what is known as the giibernaculum-. testis. The Development of the Testis.—At about the fourth or fifth week there appears in the sex-gland region of the genital ridge a structure which serves to characterize the region as a testis. This is a layer of somewhat dense con- nective tissue which grows in between the epithelial and stroma layers of the sex-gland region and gradually ex- tends around the entire sex-gland to form the tunica alhu- ginea. By its development the sex-cords are separated from the epithelium, which later becomes much flattened and K4 Fig. 207.—Reproductive Or- gans OF A Female Embryo OF Six Months.

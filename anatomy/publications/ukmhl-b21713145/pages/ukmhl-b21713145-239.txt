THE LIMB MUSCLES. 225 in Fig. 120. In the differentiation of the individual mus- cles which proceeds as the nerves extend from the trunk into the axial mesenchyme of the limb, the muscle bands undergo modifications similar to those already described as occurring in the trunk myotomes. Thus, each of the muscles represented in Fig. 120, B, is formed by the fusion of elements derived from two or more bands; the soleus and gastrocnemius represent deep and superficial layers Fig. 121.—Section through the Upper Part of the Arm showing THE Zones Supplied by the Nerves. Sv to 7v, Ventral branches; 5J to 8(/, dorsal branches of the cervical nerves.—{Bolk.) formed from the same bands by a horizontal (tangential) splitting, these same muscles contain a portion of the second sacral band which overlaps muscles composed only of higher myotomes, and the intermuscular septum between the pero- neus brevis and the flexor hallucis longus represents a por- tion of the third sacral band which has degenerated into connective tissue. A similar arrangement occurs in the bands which are to be recognized in the musculature of the upper limb. These are supplied by the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and 5^

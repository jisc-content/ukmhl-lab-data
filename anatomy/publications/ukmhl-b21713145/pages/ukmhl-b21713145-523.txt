POST-NATAL DEVELOPMENT. regarding other organs in which a marked relative diminu- tion, not in all cases readily explainable, occurs. Recent observations by Hammar render necessary some modification of the figures given for the thymus in the above table. He finds the average weight of the gland at birth to be 13.26 grms., and that the weight increases up to puberty, averaging 37.52 grms. between the ages of 11 and 15. After that period it gradually diminishes, falling to 16.27 grms. between 36 and 45 and to 6.0 grms. between 66 and 75. Ex- pressed in percentage of the body weight this gives a value in the new-born of 0.42 and in an individual of 50 years of 0.02, a difference much more striking than that shown in Vier- ordt's table. It must be mentioned, however, that the gland is subject to much individual variation, being largely influenced by nutritive conditions. The remaining organs, not included in the tables given above, when compared with the weight of the body, either show an increase or remain practically the same. ABSOLUTE WEIGHT IN GRAMS.

The difference does not, however, depend upon the differentiation of additional muscles; there

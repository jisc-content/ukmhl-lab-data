In this way the attachment of the transverse mesocolon takes the form of a transverse line instead of a point, and this portion of the mesentery divides the abdominal cavity into two portions, the upper (ante- rior) of which contains the liver and stomach, while the lower contains the remainder of the digestive tract with the exception of the duodenum. By passing across the ventral surface of the duodenum and fusing with it, the Fig. 193.â€”Diagrams Illustrating the Manner in which the Fixa- tion OF the Descending Colon (C) takes Place. transverse mesocolon forces that portion of the intestine against the dorsal wall of the abdomen and fixes it in that position, and its mesentery thereupon degenerates, becom- ing subserous areolar tissue, the duodenum assuming the retroperitoneal position which characterizes it in the adult. The descending colon, which on account of the width of its mesentery is at first freely movable, lies well over to the left side of the abdominal cavity, and in consequence the left layer_of its mesentery lies in contact with the parietal layerjjf the peritoneum. A fusion of these two layers, beginningnear the middle line and thence extend-

332 THE PANCREAS. the former, at first situated to the right of the vein, later grows across its ventral surface so as to come into contact with the dorsal gland, with which it fuses so intimately that no separation line can be distinguished. The body and tail of the adult pancreas represent the original dorsal oiitgrowth, while the right__ventral pancreas becomes the head. Both the dorsal and ventral outgrowths early become lobed, and the lobes becoming secondarily lobed and this lobation repeating itself several times, the conipquiid^tubu- .lar^structure of the adult gland is acquired, the very numer- ous terminal lobules becoming the secreting acini, while the remaining portions become the ducts. Of the principal ducts, there are , at first two :, that of the__dorsal pancreas, the duct of Santorini, opens into the duodenum on its dorsal surface, while that of the ventral outgrowth, the duct of pyirsuiig, opens into the ductus choledochus. When the fusion of the two portions of the gland occurs, an anastomo- sis of branches of the two ducts develops and the jDroximal portion of thejluct of Santorini usually degenerates, solEaT the secretion of the entire gland empties into the common bile-ducts through the duct of Wirsung\_ In the coiinecth^gjdssue which separates the lobules of the gland, groups of cells occur, which have no connection with the ducts of the gland, and form what are termed the areas of T.anfrgrhnns. They arise by a differentiation of tTi^ fplk AA/huji form the orifi^inal pancxeatic outgrowths, and have been distinguished in the dorsal pancreas of the guinea-pig while it is still a solid outgrowth.

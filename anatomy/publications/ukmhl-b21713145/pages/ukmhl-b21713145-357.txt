THE PERITONEUM. 343 1 Oumoa£ length of the cervical and thoracic regions, and when the level of the tenth thoracic segment is reached the separation of the pleural and peritoneal cavities is completed, and then the dorsal edge begins to descend more rapidly than the ventral, so that the diaphragm again becomes oblique in the same sense as in the beginning, a position which it retains in, the adult. The Development of the Peritoneum.—The peritoneal cavity is developed from the trunk-cavity of early stages and is at first in free commu- nication on all sides of the yolk-stalk with the extra-em- bryonic coelom. As the ven- tral wall of the body develops the two cavities become more and more separated, and with the formation of the umbili- cal cord the separation is com- plete. Along the mid-dorsal line of the body the archenteron forms a projection into the cavity and later moves further out from the body-wall into the cavity, pushing in front of it the peritoneum, which thus comes to surround the intestine, forming its serous coat, and from it is continued back to the dorsal body-wall forming the mesentery. It has already been seen that on the separation of the liver from the septum transversum, the tissue of the latter gives rise to the peritoneal covering of the liver and of the posterior surface of the diaphragin, and also to the ventral Fig. 190.—Diagram showing THE Position of the Dia- phragm IN Embryos of Dif- ferent Ages.—{Mall.)

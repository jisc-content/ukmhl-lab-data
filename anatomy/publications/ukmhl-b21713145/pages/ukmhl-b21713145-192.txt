DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL. 178 mesenchyme which invests the anterior portion of the noto- chord and extends forward beyond its extremity into the nasal region, forming a core for the nasal process (see p. 88). From each side of this basal mass a wing projects dorsally to enclose the anterior portion of the medullary canal which will later become the cerebral part of the cen- tral nervous system. No indications of a segmental ori- gin are to be found in this mesenchyme; as stated, it is a continuous mass, and this is likewise true of the cartilage which later develops in it. The chondrification occurs first along the median line in what will be the occipital and sphenoidal regions of the skull (Fig. icq) and thence gradually extends forward into the ethmoidal region and to a certain extent dorsally at the sides and behind into the regions later occupied by the wings of the sphenoid (as and os) and the squamous por- tion of the occipital (s). No cartilage develops, however, in the rest of the sides or in the roof of the skull, but the mesenchyme of these regions becomes converted into a dense membrane of connective tissue. While the chondri- fication is proceeding in the regions mentioned, the mesen- chyme which encloses the internal ear becomes converted into cartilage, forming a mass, the periotic capsule (Fig. lOO, p), wedged in on either side between the occipital and sphenoidal regions, with which it eventually unites to form a continuous chondrocranium^ perforated by foramina for the passage of nerves and vessels. The posterior part of the basilar portion of the occipital cartilage presents certain peculiarities of development. In calf embi"yos there are in this region, in very early stages, â€¢ four separate condensations of mesoderm corresponding to as many mesodermic somites and to the three roots of the hypoglossal nerve together with the first cervical or sub- occipital nerve (Froriep) (Fig. loi). These mesenchy-

THE MESODERMIC SOMITES. I04 compose^joLmesodermic somites, lateral to this a narrow underlying the original longitudinal groove which sep- arated the somite area from the ventral mesoderm and which from its position is termed the intermediate cell mass (Fig. 58, /), a_nd, finally, the ventral mesoderm. Thisjast poftionjsjiow^div^ two layers, the dorsal of which is termed the somatic mesoderm, while the ventral one is known as the splanchnic mesoderm (Fig. 58, so and sp; and Fig- 59) J the cavity which separates these two layers being the embryonic body-cavity o_r pi euro peritoneal cavity, whicli will eventually give rise to the pleural, pericardiaLand-peri- toneal cavities of the adult as well as the cavity of each tunica vaginalis testis. Beginning in the neck region, the formation of the meso- dermic somites proceeds anteriorly and posteriorly until finally there are present in the human embryo thirty-eight pairs in the neck and trunk regions of the body, and, in addition, a certain number are developed in what is later the occipital region of the head. Exactly how many of these occipital somites are developed is not known, but in the cow four have been observed, and there are reasons for believing that the same number occurs in the human embryo. In the lower vertebrates a number of cavities arranged in pairs occur in the more anterior portions of the head and have been homologized with mesodermic somites. Whether this homology be perfectly correct or not, these head-cavities, as they are termed, indicate the existence of a division of the head mesoderm into somites, and although practically nothing is known as to their existence in the human embryo, yet, from the relations in which they stand to the cranial nerves and musculature in the lower forms, there is reason to suppose that they are not entirely unrepresented. The mesodermic somites in the earliest human embryos in which they have been observed contain a completely closed cavity, and this is true of the majority of the somites

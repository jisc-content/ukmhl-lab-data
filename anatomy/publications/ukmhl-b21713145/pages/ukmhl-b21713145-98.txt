DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. 84 marked, and in the head region a shght ridge surrounding the eyeball and marking out the conjunctival area has appeared; a depression anterior to the nasal fossae marks off the nose from the forehead; and the external ear, whose development will be considered later on, has become quite distinct. This embryo had a neck-rump length of 13.6 mm. In the embryos xxxv (S2) and xcix (L3) (Fig. 49, A and B) of His' collection the straightening out of the neck bend is proceeding, and indeed is almost completed in em- bryo xcix, which begins to resemble closely the fully formed fetus. The tail filament, somewhat reduced in size, still persists and the rotundity of the abdomen continues to be well marked. The neck' region is beginning to be distin- guishable in embryo xxxv and in embryo xcix the eyelids have appeared as slight folds surrounding the conjunctival area. The nose and forehead are clearly defined by the greater development of the nasal groove and the nose has also become raised above the general surface of the face, while the external ear has almost acquired its final fetal form. These embryos measure respectively about 15 and 17.5 mm. in length.* Finally, an embryo—again one of those described by His, namely, his lxxvii (Wt), having a length of 23 mm.— may be figured (Fig. 50JL as representing the practical acquisition of the fetal form. This embryo dates from \about the end of the second month of pregnancy, and from this period onward it is proper to use the term fetus rather than that of embryo. The changes which have been de- scribed in preceding stages are now complete and it remains only to be mentioned that the caudal filament, which is still prominent, gradually disappears in later stages, becoming, as it were, submerged and concealedj3a^ejithjicljacenn.^arts * The embryo xxxv presents a slight abnormality in the great pro- jection of the heart, but otherwise it appears to be normal.

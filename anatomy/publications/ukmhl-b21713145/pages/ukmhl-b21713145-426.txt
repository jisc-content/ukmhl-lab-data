THE BRAIN. 412 the third ventricle, which includes the cavity of the median portion of the telencephalon as well as the entire cavity of the diencephalon. During the differentiation of the various divisions of the brain certain flexures appear in the roof and floor, and to a certain extent correspond with those already described as occurring in the embryo. The first of these flexures to appear occurs in the region of the mid-brain, the first vesicle Fig. 226.—Median Longitudinal Section of the Brain of an Embryo OF the Third Month.— (His.) being bent ventrally until it comes to lie at practically a right angle with the axis of the mid-brain. This may be termed the mid-brain flexure (Fig. 225, mf) and corre- sponds with the head-bend of the embryo. The seco£d flexure occurs in the region of thejiiedulla oblongata and is known as the neck flexure (Fig. 225, nf); it corresponds with the similarly named bend of the embryo and is pro- duced by a bending ventrally of the entire head, so that the axis of the mid-brain comes to lie almost at right angles with that of the medulla and that of the first vesicle parallel

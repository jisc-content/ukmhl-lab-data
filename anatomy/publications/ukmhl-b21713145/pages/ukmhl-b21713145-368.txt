The recent thorough study by Flint of the development of the lung of the pig shows that, in that form at least, the branching is a mono- r j podial one, and that from the main bronchus as it elongates four sets of secondary outgrowths develop, namely, a strong lateral, a dorsal, a ventral, and a weak and variable medial set. There is a general tendency for the individual branches of the various sets to be arranged in regular succession and for their development to be symmetrical in the two lungs. But on account of the necessity under which the lungs are placed of adapting themselves to the neighboring structures and at the same time affording a respiratory surface as large as possible, an amount of asymmetry supervenes. Thus, it has already been noted that in the earliest branching a single lateral bronchus is formed in the left lung and two in the right. The uppermost of these latter, the first lateral bronchus, is unrepresented in the left lung, and is peculiar in that it lies behind the right pulmonar^^iartery (Fig. 196, C), or in the adult, after the recession-of'tHe heart, above it, whence it is termed the^^^grfmo/ bronchus. Its absence on the left side is pâ‚¬rhaps_due_ to its suppression to permit the normal recession of the aoj:tic_arch_(Flint). So, too, the inclination of the heart causes a suppression of the second ventral bronchus in the left lung, but at the same time it affords opportunity for an excessive develop- ment of the corresponding bronchus of the right lung, which pushes its way between the heart and the diaphragm and is known as the infra-cardiac bronchus. As soon as the unpaired first lateral bronchus and the

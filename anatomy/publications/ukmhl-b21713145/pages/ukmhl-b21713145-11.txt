PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. vii The assimilation of the enormous mass of facts which constitute what is usually known as descriptive anatomy has always been a difficult task for the student. Part of the difficulty has been due to a lack of information re- garding the causes which have determined the structure and relations of the parts of the body, for without some knowledge of the why things are so, the facts of anatomy stand as so many isolated items, while with such knowl- edge they become bound together to a continuous whole and their study assumes the dignity of a science. The great key to the significance of the structure and relations of organs is their development, recognizing by that term the historical as well as the individual develop- ment, and the following pages constitute an attempt to present a concise statement of the development of the human body and a foundation for the proper understand- ing of the facts of anatomy. Naturally, the individual development claims the major share of attention, since its processes are the more immediate forces at work in de- termining the conditions in the adult, but where the em- bryological record fails to afford the required data, whether from its actual imperfection or from the incompleteness of our knowledge concerning it, recourse has been had to the facts of comparative anatomy as affording indications of the historical development or evolution of the parts under consideration. It has not seemed feasible to include in the book a com- plete list of the authorities consulted in its preparation.

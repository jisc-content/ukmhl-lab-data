«.THE LUNGS. 355 paired second lateral bronchi are formed mesenchyme begins to collect around each of them and also around the main bronchi, the lobes of the adult lung, three in the right lung and two in the left, being thus outlined. A development of mesenchyme also takes place around the excessively devel- oped right second ventral bronchus, and sometimes produces a well-marked infra-cardiac lobe in the right lung. In later stages the various bronchi of each lobe give rise to additional branches and these again to others, and the mesen- chyme of each lobe grows in between the various branches. At first the amount of mesen- chyme separating the branches is comparatively great, but as the branches continue, the growth of the mesenchyme fails to keep pace with it, so that in later stages the terminal enlargements are separated" from one another by only very thin partitions of mes- enchyme, in which the pulmonary vessels form a dense network. The final branchings of each ulti- mate bronchus or bronchiole re- sults in the formation at its ex- tremity of from three to five enlargements, the atria (Fig, 197, A), from which arise a number of air-sacs (vS') whose walls are pouched out into slight diverticula, the air-cells or alveoli. Such a combination of atria, air-sacs, and air-cells consti- tutes a lobule, and each lung is composed of a large number of such units. The greater part of the original pulmonary groove be- FiG. 197.—Diagram of the Final Branches of the Mammalian Bronchi. A, Atrium; B, bronchus; S, air-sac.— (Miller.)

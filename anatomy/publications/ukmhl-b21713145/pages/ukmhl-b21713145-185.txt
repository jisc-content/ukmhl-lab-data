DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERTEBRA. 171 the vertebral arches, those of the last sacral vertebrae being but feebly developed, while in the coccygeal vertebrae they are indicated only in the first. In the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, the reverse is the case, for the entire adult ver- tebra is formed from the posterior portion of a sclerotome, its lateral masses and posterior arch being the vertebral Fig. 95.—Longitudinal Section through the Occipital Region and Upper Cervical Vertebra of a Calf Embryo of 18.5 mm. has, Basilar artery; ch, notochord; Kc'-\ vertebral centra; Ic^*, inter- vertebral disks; occ, basioccipital; Sc'-\ hypochordal bars.— {Froriep.) arches, while its anterior arch is the hypochordal bar, which persists in this vertebra only. A well-developed centrum is also formed, however (Fig. 95), but it does not unite with the parts derived from the preceding- sclerotome, but during its ossification unites with the centrum of the epis- tropheus (axis), forming the odontoid process of that ver-

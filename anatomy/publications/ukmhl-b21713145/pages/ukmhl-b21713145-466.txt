THE SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM. 452 The elongated courses of the cardiac sympathetic and splanchnic nerves in the adult receive an explanation from the recession of the heart and diaphragm (see pp. 252 and 342), the latter process forcing downward the coeliac plexus, which originally occupied a position opposite the region of the gan- glionated cord from which the splanchnic nerves arise.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKIN. 149 verted principally into fibrous con- nective tissue, the outer layers of which are relatively compact, while the deeper ones are looser, forming the subcutaneous areolar tissue. Some of the mesen^hji3ial_cells, however, become coirv^rted_jnto, non-striated muscle-fibers, which for the most part are few in number and associated with the hair follicles, though in cer- tain regions, such as the skin of the scrotum, they are very numerous and form a distinct layer known as the dartos. Some cells also arrange them- selves in groups and undergo a fatty degeneration, well-defined masses of adipose tissue embedded in the lower layers of the dermis being thus formed at about the sixth month. Although the dermal mesenchyme is unsegmental in character, yet the nerves which send branches to it are segmental, and it might be expected that indica- tions of this condition would be retained by the cutaneous nerves even in the adult. A study of the cutaneous nerve- supply in the adult realizes to a very considerable extent this expectation, the areas supplied by the various nerves forming more or less distinct zones, and being therefore segmental (Fig. 79). But a considerable commingling of adjacent areas has also occurred. Thus, while the distribution of the Fig. 79—Diagram showing the Cutaneous Distribution of the Spinal Nerves — (Head.)

THE INTERNAL EAR. 467 part of the surface the cells flatten down, only a few. ag'^Ter gated together to form patches, retaining the high columnar form and developing hair-like processes upon theii; free sur- faces. These are the sensory cells of the ear. In the human ear there are in all six patches of these sensory ceHs, an elongated patch {crista ainpuUaris) in the ampulla of each semicircular canal (Fig. 251, cr), a round patch {itia- Ksp.

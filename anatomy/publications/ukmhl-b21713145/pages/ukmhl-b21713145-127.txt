11 YOLK-STALK AND FETAL MEMBRANES. US understanding it will be well to consider briefly their devel- opment in some lower form, such as the chick. At the time when the embryo of the chick begins to be constricted off from the surface of the large yolk-mass, a fold, consisting of ectoderm and somatic mesoderm, arises just outside the embryonic area, which it completely sur- rounds. As development proceeds the fold becomes higher and its edges gradually draw nearer together over the dorsal Fig. 62.—Diagrams Illustrating the Formation of the Amnion AND AlLANTOIS IN THE ChICK.

The layers of the outer waU of the fold after fusion form part qfthe general ectoderm and somatic meso- derm which make up the outer wall of the ovum and together

Shortly after birth the foramen ovale closes more or less perfectly, and the ductus arteriosus di- ' minishes in size as the piilmonary arteries increase, and ' becomes eventually converted into a fibrous cord. The ( hypogastric arteries diminish greatly, and after they have i passed the bladder are also reduced to fibrous cords, a fate 1 likewise shared by the umbilical vein, which becomes con- 1 verted into the round ligament of the liver. The Development of the Lymphatic System.—It has already been seen (p. 237) that theJ3[^phocytes^ first make their appearance in the tissues surrounding the early blood- ^.Zl^ ^ vessels, but opinions differ as to their exaclorigm. Accord- ^y*^"^ ing to some observers, they are formed by modification of mesenchyme cells, while "ptHers believe th"a1rtheY3M§_gvL dence that the lymphocytes of the intestinal and tonsillar lymph-nodes are derived from the intestinal and tonsillar epithelium, and quite recently it has been maintained that the epithelial cells which form the thymus body in fishes are directly transformed into lymphocytes. Which view will prove correct must be left for future observations to decide. The observations upon the origin of the lymphatic vessels ^ are at present somewhat discordant. According to the h^^" observations of Sabin, the vessels are first distinguishable in pig embryos of 14.5 cm. as two small sacs or lympK. hearts, which arjse^ one on each side, as outgrowths from near the junction of the subclavian and__jiigular veins^ the

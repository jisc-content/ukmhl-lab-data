156 DEVELOPMENT OF TTIE MAMMARY GLANDS. mr m been observed that in the pig the first indication of their development is seen in a thickening of the epidermis along a line situated at the junction of the abdominal walls with the membrana reuniens (Schulze). This thickening subse- quently becomes a pronounced ridge, the milk ridge, from which, at certain points, the mammary glands develop, the ridge disappearing in the intervals. In a human embryo 4 mm. in length an epidermal thickening has been ob- served which extended from just below the axilla to the inguinal region (Fig. 85) and was apparently equiva- lent to the milk line of the pig, and in em- bryos of 14 or 15 mm. the upper end of the line had become a pro- nounced ridge, while more posteriorly the thickening had disappeared. The further history of the ridge has not, however, been yet traced in human embryos, and the next stage of the development of the glands which has been observed is one in which they are represented by a circular thickening of the epidermis which projects downward into the dermis (Fig. 86, A). Later the thickening becomes lobed (Fig. 86, B), and its superficial and central cells become corni- fied and are cast off, so that the gland area appears as a depression of the surface of the skin. During the fifth and sixth months^the lobes elongate into soHd cylindrical col- umns of cells (Fig. 87) resembling not a little the cylinders Fig. 85.—Milk Ridge (wr) in a Human Em BR Yo.—(Ka lUus.)

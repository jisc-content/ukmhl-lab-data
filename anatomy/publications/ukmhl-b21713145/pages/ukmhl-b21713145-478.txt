This canal is the ductus cochlearis (scala media of the cochlea), and the remaining portion of the otocyst subsequently be- comes divided by a constriction into the utriculus. with which the semicircular ducts are con- nected, and the saccuhis. The constriction which separates the cochlear duct from the sacculus becomes the ductus while that between and sacculus is CO rcuniens, the utriculus converted into a narrow canal with which the ductus endo- 1^-npliatiais connects, and hence it is that, in the adult, the connection between these two portions of the otocyst seems to be formed by the ductus dividing proximally into two limbs, one of which is connected with the utricle and the other with the saccule. When first observed in the human embryo the auditory ganglion is closely associated with the geniculate ganglion of the seventh nerve (Fig. 248, B), the two, usually spoken of as the acustico^^ formingmas^.o^^^^^ lyjngjnclosjjcontact with the anterior wall ofjhe otocyst..

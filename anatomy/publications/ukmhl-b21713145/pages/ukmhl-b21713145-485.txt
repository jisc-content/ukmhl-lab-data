THE MIDDLE EAR. its dorsal end enlarges to formJLliÂ£_tYmpanic cavity_^ while the narrower portion intervening between this and the pharyngeal cavity represents the tuba auditiva (Eustachian tubej.^ To correctly understand the development of the tympanic cavity it is necessary to recall the structures which form its boundaries. Anteriorly to the upper end of the first branch- ial pouch there is the upper end of the first arch, and behind it the corresponding part of the second arch, the two fusing together dorsal to the tympanic cavity and forming its roof. Internally the cavity is bounded by the outer wall of the cartilaginous investment of the otocyst, while externally it is separatecFfrom the upper part of the ectodermal groove of t"he firsFbranchial cleft by the thin membrane which fornis. the floor of the groove. It has been seen in an earlier chapter that the axial meso- derm of each branchial arch gives rise to skeletal structures and muscles. The axial cartilage of the ventral portion of the first arch is what is known as Meckel's cartilage, but in that portion of the arch which forms the roof and anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, the cartilage becomes con- stricted to form two masses which later ossify to form the malleus and incus (Fig. 250, m and i), while the muscular tissue of this dorsal portion of the arch gives rise to the tensor tyntpanL Similarly, in the case of the second arch there is to be found, dorsal to the extremity of the cartilage which_forms the styloid 2rix:ess of the adult, a narrow plate of cartilage which_forms an investment fqr^the facia]_ nerve (Fig. 250, Vil), and dorsal to this a ring of cartilage (st) which surrounds a small stapedial artery and represents the stapes. ^ It has been found that in the rabbit the mass of cells from which the stapes is formed is at its first appearance quite independent of the second branchial arch (Fuchs), and it

THE PHARYNX. 312 I" the floor of the pharynx behind the thickenings wliicl: IDroduce the tongue there is to be found in early stages a pair of tliickcnings passing horizontally backward and uniting in front so that they resemble an inverted U (Fig. I7i> /). These ridges, which form what is termed the f^^rada (Ji'is), are concerned in the formation of parts of the larynx (see p. 356). In the part of the roof of the pharynx which comes to lie be- tween the openings of the Eusta- chian tubes, a collection of lym- phatic tissue takes place beneath the mucous membrane, forming the pharyngeal tonsil, and im- mediately behind this there is formed in the median line an up- wardly projecting pouch, thej>/za- ryns^eal bursa, first certainly no- ticeable in embryos 6.5 mm. in Fig. 171.—The Floor of THE Pharynx of an Em- bryo OF 2.15 MM. f, _ Furcula; t, tnberculum impar.— (His.) length. This bursa has very generally been regarded as the persistent remains of Rathke's pouch (p. 301), especially since it is much more pronounced in fetal than in adult life. It has been shown, however, that it is formed quite independently of and posterior to the true Rathke's pouch (Killian), though what its significance may be is still uncertain. The tonsils are formed from the epithelium of the lower part of the second branchial grooye. ' At about the fourth month solid buds begin to grow from the epithelium into the subjacent mesenchyme, and depressions appear on the surface of this region. Later the buds become hollow by a cornification of their central cells, and open upon the floor of the depressions which represent the crypts of the tonsil. In the meantime Ivmphorvtes, concerning whose origin there is a difference of opinion, collect in the sub- jacent mesenchyme and eventually aggregate to form lym-

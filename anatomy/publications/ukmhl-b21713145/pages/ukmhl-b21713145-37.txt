RELATION OP OVULATION TO MENSTRUATION. 2$ ceptions, however, have been observed which show that the coincidence of the two phenomena is not invariable, preg- nancy, for example, having occurred in young girls who had not yet menstruated, and in forty-two operated cases in which the ovaries and uterus had been removed after men- struation, twelve showed no signs of ovulation as deter- mined by the presence of recently ruptured follicles in the ovaries (Leopold and Mironoff), while in another set of fifty-four cases ovulation appeared to have coincided with menstruation in thirty-nine instances. From the evidence at present at our disposal it may be stated that in the human species while ovulation generally coincides with menstruation, yet the two phenomena may, and not infrequently do, occur independently of one another. In the lower mammals ovulation is, as a rule, directly asso- ciated with a condition known as oestrus or "heat," this being preceded by certain phenomena constituting what is termed the prooestrum and corresponding essentially to menstruation. In the majority of species one or more oestrous periods occur during the year in fertile females, and each of these is pre- ceded by a prorestrum. But the prooestrous phenomena do not in all forms invariably lead to an oestrum, since, although female monkeys menstruate regularly throughout the year, yet they have only one annual oestrous period (Heape). The immediate causes of the prooestrous and oestrous phe- nomena and of their periodic occurrence are as yet obscure. Animals, however, from which the ovaries have been completely removed do not exhibit the phenomena, and it has recently been found that in such animals an oestrous state, or at least a transient condition resembling oestrus may be produced by the injection of an extract of ovaries taken from animals in a prooestrous or oestrous state. On the basis of this it has been suggested that the prooestrous and oestrous phenomena are the results of an internal secretion produced by the ovaries (Mar- shall and Jolly).

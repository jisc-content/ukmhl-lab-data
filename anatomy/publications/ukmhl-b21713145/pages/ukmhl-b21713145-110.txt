96 CHAPTER IV. THE MEDULLARY GROOVE, NOTOCHORD, AND MESODERMIC SOMITES. In the youngest human embryos known, such as the Peters' embryo and the youngest embryo described by Graf Spee, there is no differentiation of the embryonic disk other than that associated with the formation of the primi- tive streak. In an embi-yo described by Eternod and meas- uring 1.3 mm. in length (Fig. 54) a median longitudinal groove (;/;) has made its appearance, marking out the axis of the disk and forming what is known as the medullary groove; and in the older embryo described by Spee (Fig. 38) a longitudinal ridge has appeared on either side of the groove, forming the medullary folds. The two folds are continuous anteriorly, but behind they are at first separate, the anterior portion of the primitive streak lying between them. In forms, such as the Reptilia, which possess a distinct blastopore, this opening lies in the interval between the two, and consequently is in the floor of the medullai*y groove, and in the mammalia, even though no well-defined blastopore is formed, yet at the time of the formation of the medullary fold an opening breaks through at the anterior end of the primitive streak and places the cavity lying below the endoderm in communication with the space bounded by the medullary folds. The canal so formed is termed the ncurcntcric canal (Fig. 55, nc) and is so called because it unites what will later become the cen-

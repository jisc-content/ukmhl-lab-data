THE CRANIAL NERVES. 437 Others a dislocation, as it were, of the two roots had oc- curred. The results obtained from investigation along this line have not, however, proved entirely satisfactory, and facts have been elucidated which seem to show that it is not possible to extend Bell's law, in its original form at least, to the cranial nerves. It has been found that it is not sufficient to recognize simply afferent and efferent roots, but these must be analyzed into further components, and when this is done it is found that in the series of cranial nerves certain components occur which are not represented in the nerves of the spinal series. Before proceeding to a description of these components it will be well to call attention to a matter already alluded to in a previous chapter (p. no) in connection with the segmentation of the mesoderm of the head. It has been pointed out that while there exist " head-cavities " which are serially homologous with the mesodermal somites of the trunk, there has been imposed upon this primary cranial metamerism a secondary metamerism represented by the branchiomeres associated with the branchial arches, and, it may be added, this secondary metamerism has become the more prominent of the two, the primary one, as it devel- oped, gradually slipping into the background until, in the higher vertebrates, it has become to a very considerable extent rudimentary. In accordance with this double me- tamerism it is necessary to recognize two sets of cranial muscles, one derived from the cranial myotomes and rep- resented by the muscles of the eyeball, and one derived from the branchiomeric mesoderm, and it is necessary also to recognize for these two sets of muscles two. sets of motor nerves, so that, with the dorsal or sensory nerve-roots, there are altogether three sets of nerve-roots in the cranial region instead of only two, as in the spinal region.

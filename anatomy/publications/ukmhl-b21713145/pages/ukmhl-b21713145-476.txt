462 THE INTERNAL EAR. The ectoderm lining the pits is somewhat thicl<er than is the neighboring ectoderm of the surface of the body, and, from analogy with what occurs in other vertebrates, it seems prob- able that the pits are formed by the invagination of localized thickenings of the ectoderm. The mouth of each pit grad- ually becomes smaller, until finally the invagination is con- verted into a closed sac (Fig. 247, B), which separates from the surface ectoderm and becomes enclosed within the sub- jacent mesoderm. This sac is the otocyst, and in the stage just described, found in embryos of 4 mm., it has an oval or more or less spherical form. Soon, however, in embryos of 6.9 mm., a prolongation arises from its dorsal portion Fig. 247.—Transverse Section Passing through the Otocyst (ot) OF Embryos of (A) 2.4 mm. and (B) 4 mm.—(His.) and the sac assumes the form shown in Fig. 248, A; this prolongation, which is held by some authors to be the re- mains of the stalk which originally connected the otocyst sac with the surface ectoderm, represents the ductus endo- ly_JJ];phcitj£ii£^ and, increasing in length, it soon becomes a strong club-shaped process, projecting considerably beyond the remaining portions of the otocyst (Fig. 248, B). In embryos of about 10.2 mm. the sac begins to show certain other irregularities of shape (Fig. 248, B,sc). Thus, about opposite the point of origin of the ductus endolymphaticus three folds make their appearance, representing the scini- circular ducts, and as they increase in size the opposite waTTs

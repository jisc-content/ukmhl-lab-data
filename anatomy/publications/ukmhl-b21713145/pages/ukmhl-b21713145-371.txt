The open- ing is, however, for a .time, almost-obHterated by a thick- ening of the epithelium covering the ridges, and it is not until the tenth or eleventh week of development that it is re-established. Later than this, at the middle of the fourth month, a linear depression makes its appearance on the mesial wall of each arytenoid ridge, forming the beginning of the ventricle, and although at first the depression lies horizontally its lateral edge later bends anteriorly, so that its surfaces look outwards and inwards. The lips which Fig. 199.—Reconstruction of the Mesenchyme Condensations which Represent the Hyoid and Thyreoid Cartilages in an Embryo of Forty Days.

The cartilages of the larynx can be distinguished during the seventh week as condensations of mesenchyme which are but indistinctly separated from one another. The thy- reoid cartilage is represented at this stage by two lateral plates of mesenchyme, separated from one another both ventrally and dorsally, and each of these plates undergoes chondrification from two separate centers (Fig. 199). These, as they increase in size, unite together and send prolonga- tions ventrally which meet in the mid-ventral line with the

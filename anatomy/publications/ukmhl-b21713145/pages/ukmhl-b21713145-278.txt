The Development of the Arteries of the Limbs.— Much information is still required before the complete his- tory of the development of the arteries of the limbs can be written, and at present one must rely largely upon the facts PiQ 147.—Embryo of 13 mm. showing the Mode of Development OF the Internal Mammary and Deep Epigastric Arteries.— . iMall.) of comparative anatomy and on the anomalies which occur in the human body for indications of what the early devel- opment is likely to be. So far as embryological observa- tions go, they confirm the conclusions derived from such sources. Notwithstanding the fact that the limbs are formed by outgrowths from_^several segments, there is as yet no evi- dence to, show That a corresponding number of segmental

THE MATURATION OF THE OVUM, 30 themselves in order that the fourth may have the bulk, that is to say, the amount of nutritive material and cytoplasm necessary for successful development. In the mouse, which for the present must be taken as type of the mammalia, the majority of ova show an appar- ent departure from the processes just described. The num- ber of chromosomes occurring- in the somatic cells of the Fig. 14.—Ovum of a Mouse Showing the Maturation Spindle. The ovum is enclosed by the zona pellucida {s.p), to which the cells of the corona radiata are still attached.—(Sobotta.) mouse is twenty-four. The first maturation spindle (Fig. 14) possesses twelve chromosomes, which from analogy with the lower forms may be assumed to be tetrads, and during the metaphase each chromosome divides transversely, the polar globule receiving twelve chromosomes, presum- ably dyads, while twelve remain within the ovum.

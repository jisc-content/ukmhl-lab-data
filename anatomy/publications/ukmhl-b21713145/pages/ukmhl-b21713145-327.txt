THE TONSIL. phatic follicles in close relation with the buds. Whether the lymphocytes wander out from the blood into the mesen- chyme or are derivecl_directly from the epithelium or the mesenchyme cells is the question at issue. The tonsil may grow to a size sufficient to fill up com- pletely the groove in which it forms, but not infrequently a marked depression, the fossa mpratonsillaris, exists above it and represents a portion of the original second branchial furrow. The groove of R^semnilller, which was at one time thought to be also_a^remnant of the second furrow, is a secondary depression which appears in embryos of 11.5 cm. behind the opening of the Eustachian tube, in about tlie region of the-third branchigil furrow. The Development of the Branchial Epithelial Bodies.—• These are structures which arise either as thickenings or as outpouchings of the epithelium lining the lower portions of the inner branchial furrows. Five pairs of these struc- tures are developed and, in addition, there is a single un- paired median body. This last makes its appearance in eiiiHryos of about 3 mm., and gives rise to the major por- tion of the thyreoid body. It is situated immediately be- hind the anterior portion of the tongue, at the apex of the groove between this and the posterior portion, and is first a slight pouch-like depression (Fig. 167). As it deepens, its extremity becomes bilobed, and after the embryo has reached a length of 6 mm. it becomes completely separated from the floor of the pharynx. The point of its original origin is, however, permanently marked by a circular de- pression, the foramen ccccum (Fig. 168, fc). Later the bilobed body migrates down the neck and becomes a solid transversely elongated mass (Fig. 172, th), into the sub- stance of which trabeculse of connective tissue extend, divid- ing it into a network of anastomosing cords which later 28

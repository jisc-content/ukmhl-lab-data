THE PANCREAS.' accompanied by" an actual degeneration of portions of the liver tissue, the cells disappearing completely, while the ducts and blood-vessels originally present persist, the for- mer constituting the va-sa aberrantia of adult anatomy.. These are usually especially noticeable at the left edge' of the liver, between the folds of the left lateral . *^ ligament, but they may also be found along the line of the vena cava, around the gall-bladder, and in the region, of the left longitudinal fissure. The Development of the Pancreas.—The pan- creas arises a little later than the liver^ as three separate outgrowths, one from the dorsal surface of the duodenum (Fig. 185, DP) usually a little above the liver outgrowth, and one oh each side from the lower part of the com- mon bile-duet. Of the latter outgrowths, that upon the J_e.ft side (Vps) early begins to degenerate and completely disap- pears, while that of"the right side (Vpd) con- FlG. 185.—RiA u.\ .^iRUCTION OF THE Pancreatic Outgrowths of an Embryo of 7.5 mm.

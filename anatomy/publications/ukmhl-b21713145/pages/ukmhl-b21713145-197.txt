OSSIFICATION OF THE CHONDROCRANIUM. 183 Two pairs of centers have been described for the inter- parietal bone and it has been claimed that the deep lateral incisions divide the lower pair, so that when the incisions meet and persist as the sutura mendosa, separating the so- called inca bone from the rest of the occipital, the division does not correspond to the line between the supraoccipital and the interparietal, but a portion of the latter bone remains in connection with the supraoccipital. Mall, however, in twenty preparations, found but a single pair of centers for the interparietal. Occasionally an additional pair of small centers appear for the uppermost angle of the interparietal, and the bones Fig. 104.—Sphenoid Bone from Embryo of 3^ to 4 Months. The parts which are still cartilaginous are represented in black, as, Alisphenoid; h, basisphenoid; lingula; os, orbitosphenoid; p, internal pterygoid ^Iztt—{Sappcy.) formed from them may remain distinct as what have been termed fontanelle hones. In the sphenoidal region the number of distinct bones which develop is much greater than in the occipital region. In the first place, at the beginning of the ninth week a center appears in each of the cartilages which represent the alisphe- noids (great wings) (Fig. 104, as), and at about the twelfth week a center appears in each orbitosphenoid (lesser wing) cartilage {os). A little later a pair of centers (bs), placed side by side, are developed in the cartilage representing the posterior portion of the body and together represent what

In a considerable percentage of individuals the third molars (wisdom teeth) never break through the gums, and frequently when they do so they fail to reach the level of the other teeth, and so are only partly functional. These and other peculiari- ties of a structural nature shown by these teeth indicate that they are undergoing a retrogressive evolution. The Development of the Tongue.â€”Strictly speaking, the tongue is largely a development of the pharyngeal re- gion of the digestive tract and only secondarily grows for- ward into the floor of the mouth. In embryos of about 3 mm. there may be seen in the median line of the floor of the mouth, between the ventral ends of the first and second branchial arches, a small rounded elevation w hich has been termed the tuherculum impar (Fig. lyi, t). In later stages (Fig. 167, A) this becomes larger and reaches its greatest development in embryos of about 8 mm., after _wliich it becomes less prominent and finally unrecognizable; but before this there has appeared on each side of the_floor of_ the mouth a longitudinal groove, each of which at its ante- rior end bends medially toward its fellow. By these_a/z/^o/o- lingual grooves an area is marked out in the floor of the moutii which gradually becomes more and more prominent and rounded upon its oral surface, and forms the anterior portion of the tongue (Fig. 167, B, f). This median^elc::. vation is bounded_at the sides and almost to the median line in_front by the alveolo-lingual grooves, and posteriorly it is

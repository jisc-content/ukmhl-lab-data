THE UROGENITAL SINUS. 384 jjvhich the Wolffian_and Miillerian ducts open. This con- necting canal represents the urethra (Fig-.~2i3. ur), or rather the entire urethra of the female^ and the proximal part of that of the male, since a considerable portion of the latter canal is still undeveloped (see p. 386). From this urethra there is developed, at about the third month. a series of solid longitudinal folds which project upon the outer surface and separate from the urethra from above downward. These represent the tubules of the prostate gland and are developed J n bpth sexes, a 1 though they re- main in a somewhat rudimentary condition in the female. The muscular tissue, so characteristic of the gland in the adult male, is developed from the surrounding mesenchyme at a later stage. The urogenital sinus is in the early stages also tubular in its upper part, though it expands considerably below, where it is closed by the cloacal membrane. This, by the separation of the cloaca into rectum and sinus, has become divided into two portion^ the more ventral of which closes the sinus and the dorsaL_t]iÂ£-.rectum, the interval between them having become considerably thickened to form the perineal body^ In embryos of about 17 mm. the urogenital portion of the membrane has broken through, and in later stages the tubular portion of the sinus is^radually taken up into the more expanded lower portion, until finally the entire sinus forms a shallow depression, termed the vesti- bule, into the upper part of which the urethra opens, while below,are the openings of the . Wolffian (ejaculatory) ducts in the male or the orifice__of the vagina in the female. From the sides of the lower part of the sinus a pair of evaginations arise toward the end of the fourth month and give rise to the bulbo-vestibular glands^ (Bartholin's) of the female or the corresponding bulbo-uretltral glands (Cozuper's) in the male.

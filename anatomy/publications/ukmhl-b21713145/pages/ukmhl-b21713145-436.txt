In addition to the epiphy- sial evaginations, another evagination arises from the roof-plate of the first brain vesicle, further forward, in the region which becomes the median portion of the telen- cephalon. This parcuphysis, as it has been called, has been observed in the lower verte- brates and in the Marsupials (Selenka), but up to the pres- ent has not been found in other groups of the Mamma- lia. It seems to be compar- able to a chorioid plexus which is evaginated from the brain surface instead of being invaginated as is us- ually the case. There is no evidence that a paraphysis is developed in the h u m a n brain. The portion of the roof- plate which lies in front of the epiphysis represents the velum interpositum of the adult brain, and it forms at first a distinct ridge (Fig. 232). At an early stage.

THE OPTIC NERVE. 492 rounded by a number of nuclei representing- the mantle layer and surrounding these a non-nucleated layer, resembling the margmal velum and continuous distally with the similar layer of the retina. When the ganglion cells of the latter begm to send out their axis-cylinder processes, these pass into the retinal marginal velum and converge in this layer toward the bottom of the ciliary fis- sure, so reaching the ventral wall of the optic stalk, in the velum of which they may be distin- guished in rat embryos of 4 mm., and still more clearly in those of 9 mm. (Fig. 268, A). Later, as the fibers become more numerous, they gradually invade the lateral and finally the dorsal walls of the stalk, and, at the same time the mantle cells of the stalk become more scattered and assume the form of connec- tive-tissue (neuroglia) cells, while the original cavity of the stalk is gradually obliterated (Fig. 268, B). Finallyj,_the_stalk becomes a solid mass of nerve-fibers,^, among which the altered jiiantle cells are scattered. From what has been stated above it will be seen that the sensory cells of the eye belong to a somewhat different cate- gory from those of the other sense-organs. Embryologically they are a specialized portion of the mantle layer of the medul- lary canal, whereas in the other organs they are peripheral structures either representing or being associated with repre- sentatives of posterior root ganglion cells. Viewed from this standpoint, and taking into consideration the fact that the sensory portion of the retina is formed from the invaginated part of the optic bulb, some light is thrown upon the inverted Fig. 267. â€” Diagram MATic Longitudinal Section OF THE Optic Cup and Stalk passing through THE Chorioid Fissure.

I02 THE MESODERMIC SOMITES. the interval between which the ectoderm of the floor of the medullary groove and the chorda endoderm are in close contact (Fig. 34). These lateral plates represent the gas- tral mesoderm, whose origin has already been described (p. 62), and which apparently supplants the original pros- tomial mesoderm, whose fate in the human embryo is at present unknown. The changes which now occur have not as yet been observed in the human embryo, though they probably resemble those described in other mammalian em- bryos, and the phenomena which occur in the sheep may serve to illustrate their probable nature. The lateral plates increase in size by the multiplication Fig. 58.—Transverse Section through the Second Mesodermic Somite of a Sheep Embryo 3 mm. Long. am.

In the region which will later become the neck of the embryo a longitudinal groove appears upon the dorsal surfjice of each plate, marking off the more median thicker portion from the lateral parts, and the median portions then become divided transversely into a number of more or less

OVULATION. finally lead to a rupture, and it has also been pointed out that just before the maturation of the follicle the theca interna undergoes an exceedingly rapid development and vascularization which may play an important part in the phenomenon. Normally the ovum when expelled from its follicle is received at once into the Fallopian tube, and so makes its way to the uterfis, in whose cavity it undergoes its develop- ment. Occasionally, however, this normal course may be interfered with, the ovum coming to rest in the tube and there undergoing its development and producing a tubal pregnancy; or, again, the ovum may not find its way into the Fallopian tube, but may fall from the follicle into the abdominal cavity, where, if it has been fertilized, it will undergo development, producing an abdominal pregnancy; and, finally, and still more rarely, the ovum may not be ex- pelled when the Graafian follicle ruptures and yet may be fertilized and undergo its development within the follicle, bringing about what is termed an ovarian pregnancy. All these varieties of extra-uterine pregnancy are, of course, exceedingly serious, since in none of them is the fetus viable. It was long believed that ovulation was coincident with certain periodic changes of the uterus which constitute what is termed menstruation. This phenomenon makes its ap- pearance at the time of puberty, the exact age at which it appears being determined by individual and racial peculiari- ties and by climate and other factors, and after it has once appeared it normally recurs at definite intervals more or less closely corresponding with lunar months (i. e., at inter- vals of about twenty-eight days, the extremes being from twenty-four to thirty-four days) until somewhere in the neighborhood of the fortieth or forty-fifth year, when it ceases.

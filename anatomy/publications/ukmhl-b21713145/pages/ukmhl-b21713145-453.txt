THE CRANIAL NERVES. 439 nuclei almost invariably unite with sensory fibers to form a mixed nerve, but those from all the ventral motor nuclei form independent roots, while the olfactory and auditory nerves alone, of all the sensory roots (omitting for the pres- ent the optic nerve), do not contain fibers from either of the series of motor nuclei. The relations of the various cranial nerves to the nuclei may be seen from the following table, in which the + sign indicates the presence and the — sign the absence of fibers from the nuclear series under which it stands: Number.

Of these, the second or optic nerve undoubtedly belongs to an entirely different category from the other peripheral nerves, and will be considered in the following chapter in connection with the sense-organ with which it is associated (see especially p. 491). The twelfth or hypoglossal nerve, on the other hand, really be- longs to the spinal series and has only secondarily been taken up into the cranial region in the higher vertebrates. It has already been seen (p. 179) that the bodies of four vertebrae are included in the basioccipital bone, and that three of the nerves corresponding to these vertebrae are represented in the adult by the hypoglossal and the fourth by the first cer- vical or suboccipital nerve. The dorsal roots of the hypo-

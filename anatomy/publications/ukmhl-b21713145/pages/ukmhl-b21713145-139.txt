THE UMBILICAL CORD. 125 of the small intestine, but later the entire cavity becomes more and more encroached upon by the growth of the meso- derm, and at about the fourth month is entirely obliterated. A section of the cord subsequent to that period of develop- ment will show a solid mass of mesoderm in which are em- bedded the umbilical arteries and vein, the allantois, and the rudiments of the yolk-stalk (Fig. 65, B). When fully formed, the umbilical cord measures on the average 55 cm. in length, though it varies considerably in different cases, and has a diameter of about 1.5 cm. Tt presents the appearance of being spirally twisted, an appear- ance largely due, however, to the spiral course pursued by the umbilical arteries, though the entire cord may undergo a certain amount of torsion from the movements of the embryo in the later stages of development and may even be knotted. The greater part of its substance is formed by the mesoderm, the cells of which become stellate and form a reticulum, the meshes of which are occupied by connec- tive-tissue fibrils and a mucous fluid which gives to the tissue a jelly-like consistence, whence it has received the name of Wharton's jelly. The Chorion.â€”To understand the developmental changes which the chorion undergoes it will be of advantage to obtain some insight into the manner in which the ovum becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus. Nothing is known as to how this implantation is eflfected in the case of the human ovum; it has already been accomplished in the youngest ovum at present known. But the process has been observed in other mammals, and what takes place in Spermophilus, for example, may be supposed to give a clue to what occurs in the human ovum. In the spermophile the ovum lies free in the uterine cavity up to a stage at which the vacuolization of the central cells is almost com- pleted (Fig. 66, A). At one region of the covering layer

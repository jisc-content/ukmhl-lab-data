THE SEGMENTATION OF THE OVUM. 42 huge mass of yolk. The inertia of this mass of nutritive material is so great that the segmentation is confined to the small yolkless disk of protoplasm and affects consequently only a portion of the entire ovum. To distinguish this form of segmentation from that which affects the entire ovum it D Fig. i8.—Four Stages in the Segmentation of the Blastoderm OF THE Chick.—(Costc.) is termed merohlastic segmentation, the other form being known as holoblastic. In the ovum of a turtle or a bird the first plane of seg- mentation crosses the protoplasmic disk, dividing it into two practically equal halves, and the second plane forms at approximately right angles to the first one, dividing the disk into four quadrants (Fig. i8, A). The third division, like the two which precede it, is radial in position, while

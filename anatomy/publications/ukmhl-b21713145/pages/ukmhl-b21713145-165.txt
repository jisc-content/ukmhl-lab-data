DEVELOPMENT OF THE NAILS. surrounding the areas deepen, especially at their proximal edges, where they form the nail-folds (nf), while distally thickenings of the epidermis occur to form what have been termed sole-plates (sp), structures quite rudimentary in man, but largely developed in the lower animals, in which they form a considerable portion of the claws. The actual nail substance does not form, however, until Fig. 8i.â€”Longitudinal Section through the Terminal Joint of THE Index-finger of an Embryo of 4.5 cm. e, Epidermis; ep, epitrichium; nf, nail fold; Ph, terminal phalanx; sp, sole plate. the embryo has reached a length of about 17 cm. By this time the epidermis has become several layers thick and its outer layers, over the nail areas as well as elsewhere, have bcome transformed into the stratum corneum (Fig. 82, sc), and it is in the deep layers of this (the stratum lucidum) tliat keratin granules develop in cells^jwdiidi_de^pnpratP to g]ye_riseJCLth^iaiLsii^^ (n).

The homologies of the parts of the spermatozoon with those of the spermatid may be presented in tabular form thus: Spermatid. Spermatozoon. Nucleus. Head. Archoplasm. Head-cap. Centrosome.

The spermatozoon is, then, one of four equivalent cells, produced by two successive divisions of a primary spermat- ocyte and containing one half the number of chromosomes characteristic for the species. The Ovum.—The human ovum is a spherical cell meas- uring about 0.2 mm. in diameter and is contained within a cavity situated near or at the surface of the ovary and termed a Graafian follicle. This follicle is surrounded by a capsule composed of two layers, an. outer one, the theca externa, consisting of fibrous tissue resembling that found in the ovarian stroma, and an inner one, the theca interna, composed of numerous spherical and fusiform cells. Both the thecse are richly supplied with blood-vessels, the theca interna especially being the seat of a very rich capillary network. Internal to the theca interna there is a trans- parent, thin, and structureless hyaline membrane, within which is the follicle proper, whose wall is formed by a layer of cells termed the stratum granulosum (Fig. 9, mg) and inclosing a cavity filled with an albuminous fluid, the 3

277 DEVELOPMENT OF TIIE VENOUS SYSTEM. appears, as_ does also tha^ portion of the left side of the uppeT^loop which intervenes between the middle cross-con- nection and the ductus venosus, and so there is formed from the omphalo-mesenteric veins the vena porta. While these changes have been progressing the^ight_ umbilical vem, originallyjhe larger of the two (Fig. 153, A and B, V.u.d), has become very much reduced in size and, losing its connection with the left vein at the umbilicus, forms a vein of the ventral abdominal wall in which the blood now flows from above downward. The left umbili- cal now forms the only route for the return of blood from the placenta, and appears to be the direct continuation of the ductus venosus (Fig. 154, C), iato which open the hepatic veins, returning the blood distributed by the portal vein to the substance of the liver. Returning now to the posterior cardinal veins, it has been found that in the rabbit the branches which come to them from the mesentery anastomose longitudinally to form a vessel lying parallel and slightly ventral to each cardinal. These may be termed the subcardinal veins (Lewis), and in their earliest condition they o^en at either end into the corresponding cardinal, with which they are also united by numerous cross-branches. Later, in rabbits of 8.8 mm., these cross-branches begin to disappear and give place to a large cross-branch situated immediately below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and at the same point a cross-branch between the two subcardinals also develops. The portion of the right subcardinal which is anterior to the cross-connection now rapidly enlarges and unites with the ductus venosus about where the hepatic veins open into that vessel (Fig. 155, A), and the portion of each posterior cardinal immediately above the entrance of the renal veins degenerates, so that all the blood received by the posterior portions of the cardinals is returned to the heart by way of

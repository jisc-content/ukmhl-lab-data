4 INTRODUCTION. protoplasm as the cytoplasm from the nuclear protoplasm or karyoplasni. The study of protoplasm coagulated by reagents seems to nidicate that it is a mixture of substances rather than a simple chemical compound. Both the cytoplasm and the karyoplasm consist of a more solid substance, the rctic- rihim, which forms a network or felt-work, in the inter- stices of which is a more fluid material, the enchylema * The karyoplasm, in addition, has scattered along the fibers of its reticulum a peculiar material termed chromatin and usually contains embedded in its substance one or more spherical bodies termed nucleoli which may be simply larger masses__of-chromatin or bodies of special chemical compo^ sition. And, finally, in all actively growing cells there is differentiated in the cytoplasm a peculiar body known as the arctoplasni sphere, in the center of which there is usually a minute spherical body known as the centrosome. It has been already stated that new cells arise by the division of preexisting ones, and this process is associated with a series of complicated phenomena which have great significance in connection with some of the problems of embryology. When such a cell as has been described above is about to divide, the fibers of the reticulum in the neigh- borhood of the archoplasm sphere arrange themselves so as to form fibrils radiating in all directions from the sphere as a center, and the archoplasm with its contained centro- some gradually elongates and finally divides, each portion retaining its share of the radiating fibrils, so that two asters, * It has been observed that certain coagtilable substances and gelatin, when subjected to the reagents usually employed for "fixing" proto- plasm, present a structure similar to that of protoplasm, and it has been held that protoplasm in the uncoagulated condition is, like these sub- stances, a more or less homogeneous material. On the other hand, Biitschli maintains that living protoplasm lias a foam-structure and is, in other words, an emulsion.

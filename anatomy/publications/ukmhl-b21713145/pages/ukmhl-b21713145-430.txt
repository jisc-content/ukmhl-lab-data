4i6 THE MYELENCEPHALON. from the spinal cotcI and witli the oHvary fibers to form a round bundle situated in theHoi'saT portion~qjf' the marginal velum and known asJhe restiform body (Fig, 228, trY. The principal differentiations of the zones of the myelen- cephalon may be stated in tabular form as follows: Roof-plate, Posterior velum Dorsal zones, ' Nuclei of termination of sensory roots of cranial nerves. Nuclei of GoU and Burdach. ^ The olivary bodies. r Nuclei of origin of the motor roots of Ventral zones, J cranial nerves. The reticular formation. "Ploor-plate, The median raphe. The Development of the Metencephalon and Isthmus.— Our knowledge of the development of the metencephalon, isthmus, and mesencephalon is by no means as complete as is that of the myelencephalon. The pons develops as a thickening of the portion of the brain floor which forms the anterior wall of the pons flexure, and its transverse fibers are well developed by the fourth month (Mihalko- vicz), but all details regarding the origin of the pons nuclei are as yet wanting. If one may argue from what occurs i^the myelencephalon, it seems probable that the reticular formation of the metencephalon is derived from the ventral zone, and that the median raphe represents the floor-plate. Furthermore, the relations of the pons nuclei to the reticu- lar formation on the one hand, and its connection by means of the transverse pons fibers with the cerel^ellum on the other, su£g;est_the possibility thnt they may be the meten- cephalic representatives^^ nf thp olivary bodies and are formed by a migxatipa-Ji^ntralLv.,neuroblasts from the dorsal zones.

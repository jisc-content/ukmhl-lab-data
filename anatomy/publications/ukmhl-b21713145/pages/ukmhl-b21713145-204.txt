igO OSSIFICATION OF BRANCHIAL ARCH SKELETON. fifth centers lie above the first and give rise to the inner and outer portions of the orbital plate and the body of the bone. The first, second, fom-th, and fifth portions early unite to- gether, but the third center, which really lies in the ven- tral part of the nasal process, remains separate for some time, forming what is termed the premaxilla, a bone which remains permanently distinct in the majority of the lower mammals. The above is the generally accepted view as to the develop- ment of the maxilla. Mall, however, maintains that it has but two centers of ossification, one giving rise to the pre- maxilla and the other to the rest of the bone. The max- illary center makes its appear- ance about the middle of the sixth week. Since the condition known as hare-lip results from a fail- ure of the maxillary process to unite completely with the frontonasal process (see p. 89), and since the premax- illa develops in the latter and the maxilla in the former, the cleft may pass between these two bones and prevent their union (see also p. 301). The upper end of Meckel's cartilage passes between the tympanic bone and the outer surface of the periotic cap- sule and thus comes to lie apparently within the tympanic cavity of the ear; this portion of the cartilage divides into two parts which ossify to form two of the bones of the mid- dle ear, the malleus and incus, a description of whose further development may be postponed until a later chap- ter. At about the middle of the sixth week of development a plate of membrane bone appears to the outer side of the lower portion of the cartilage and gradually extends to form the greater portion of the body of the mandible, the ramuss Fig. 107.—Diagram of the Os- sifications OF which the Max- illa is Composed, as seen from THE Outer Surface.

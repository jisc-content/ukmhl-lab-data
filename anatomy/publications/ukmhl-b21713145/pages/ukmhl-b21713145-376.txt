THE PRONEPHROS. 362 plete development, making no connection with the duct, and indeed the anterior one hardly deserves to be termed a tubule, since it is a solid cord of cells, continuous at one extremity with the coelomic epithelium. The posterior one is, however, a hollow tubule ending blindly at one extrem- ity, while at the other it communicates with the coelomic cavity, the opening being termed a nephrostome. Oppo- site these rudimentary tubules there arises from the root of the mesentery a process which projects freely into the coelom toward the nephrostomes. This probably represents Fig. 201.—Transverse Section through Chick Embryo of about Thirty-six Hours. en, Endoderm; im, intermediate cell mass; ms, mesodermic somite; nc, notochord; so, somatic, and sp, splanchnic mesoderm; wd, Wolffian duct.—(JValdeyer.) a rudimentary free glomerulus, into which branches from the aorta may project. Structures which are probably to be identified as pro- nephric tubules have been observed in older embryos up to 20 mm. (Tandler), situated at the sides of the aorta from about the seventh to the eleventh segments. They present, however, signs of degeneration, having, for instance, no connection with the coelomic epithelium in older embryos, and it seems probable that they later disappear completely. A similar but more perfectly developed pronephros has been described in other mammals, such as the rabbit and rat, and is of constant occurrence in all the lower vertebrates. In these the pronephric tubules, which may be six (in the lamprey) or

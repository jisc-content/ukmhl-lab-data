The significance of these structures is uncertain, though it has been suggested that they are persisting rudiments of the prone- phros. A failure of the development of the various parts just de- scribed to be completed in the normal manner leads to various abnormalities in connection with the reproductive organs. Thus there may occur a failure in the fusion of the lower por- tions of the Miillerian ducts, a bihorned or bipartite uterus resulting, or the two ducts may come into contact and their adjacent walls fail to disappear, the result being a median par- tition separating the vagina or both the vagina and uterus into two compartments. The excessive development of the fold which gives rise to the hymen may lead to a complete closure of the lower opening of the vagina, while, on the other hand, a failure of the Miillerian ducts to fuse may produce a biper- forate hymen. The Development of the Urinary Bladder and the Urogenital Sinus.—So far the relations of the lower ends of the urinogenital ducts have not been considered in detail, although it has been seen that in the early stages of develop- ment the Wolffian and Miillerian ducts open into the sides of the ventral portion of the cloaca; that the ureters com- municate withjhe lower portions of the Wolffi^^TductT; that from the ventral anterior poi^ion of the" cloaca~the*

DEVELOPMENT OF THE VENOUS SYSTEM. 269 continued increase in size of the external iliac ajid its cmv tiniiation, the femoral (/), accom2anied by a reduction of tlie_upper portion of the sciatic and its separation from its poplileal portion (p) to form the inferior gluteal artery of the adult. The continuation of the popliteal down the leg is the peroneal artery (pe) and the upper perforating branch of this unites with the lower one to, form a_continuous ante- rior tibial, the lower connection of which with the peroneal persists in part as the anterior peroneal artery. A new branch arises from the upper part of the peroneal and passes down the back of the leg to unite with the lower part of the arteria saphena, forming the posterior tibial artery (pt), and the upper part of the saphenous becomes much reduced, persisting as the superficial branch of the art, genu suprema and a rudimentary chain of anastomoses which accompany the long saphenous nerve. The Development of the Venous System.â€”The earli- est veins to develop are those which accompany the first- formed arteries, the omphalo-rnesenterics and umbiHcals, but it will be more convenient to consider first the veins which carry the blood from the body of the embryo back to the heart. These make their appearance, while the heartjs still in the pharyngeal region, as two pairs of longi- tudinal trunks, the anterior and posterior cardinal veins, into which lateral branches, arranged more or less seg- mentally, open. The anterior cardinals appear somewhat earlier than the posterior and form the internal jugular veins of adult anatomy. Each vein extends forward from the heart at the side of the notochord and is continued on the under siirface of the brain, lying medial to the roots of the cranial_nerves. Later sprouts arising from the vein form loops around the nerve roots and the portion of the loops formed by the original vein then disappear, so that the vessel now lies lateral to nerve roots, except in the case

Since the p-ubernaculum is attached to the bottom of the process, and since its gi'owth has again diminished, the testes gradually assume again their inguinal position, and are finally drawn down into the scrotum with the vaginal processes. The condition which is thus acquired persists for some time after birth, the testicles being readily pushed upward into the abdominal cavity along the cavity by which they Fig. 215.—^DiAGRAMS Illustrating the Descent of the Testis. il, Inguinal ligament; m, muscular layer; s, skin and dartos of the scro- tum; t, testis; tv, tunica vaginalis; vd, vas deferens; vp, vaginal process of peritoneum.—(After Hertzvig.) descended. Later, however, the size of the openings of the vaginal processes into the general peritoneal cavity becomes greatly reduced, so that each process becomes converted into an upper narrow neck and a lower sac-like cavity (Fig. 215, B), and, still later, the walls of the neck portion fuse and become converted into a solid cord, while the lower portion, wrapping itself around the testis, becomes the tunica vaginalis (tv). By these changes the testes become per- manently located in the scrotum. During the descent of the testes the remains of each Wolffian body, the epididymis,

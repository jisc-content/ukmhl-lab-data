I I 2 CHAPTER V. THE YOLK-STALK, BELLY-STALK, AND FETAL MEMBRANES. The conditions to which the embryos and larvae of the majority of animals must adapt themselves are so different from those under which the adult organisms exist that in the early stages of development special organs are very fre- quently developed which are of use only during the em- bryonic or larval period and are discarded when more advanced stages of development have been reached. This remark applies with especial force to the human embryo which leads for a period of nine months what may be termed a parasitic existence, drawing its nutrition from and yielding up its waste products to the blood of the parent. In order that this may be accomplished certain special organs are developed by the embryo, by means of which it forms an intimate connection with the walls of the uterus, which, on its part, becomes greatly modified, the combination of em- bryonic and maternal structures producing what are termed the deciducB, owing to their being discarded at birth when the parasitic mode of life is given up. Furthermore, it has already been seen that many pecu- liar modifications of development in the human embryo result from the inheritance of structures from more or less remote ancestors, and among the embryonic adnexes are found structures which represent in a more or less modi- fied condition organs of considerable functional importance in lower forms. Such structures are the yolk-stalk and reside, the amnion, and the allantois, and for their proper

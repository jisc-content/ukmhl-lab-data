203 CHAPTER VIIL THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Two forms of muscular tissue exist in the human body, the striated tissue, which forms the skeletal muscles and is under the control of the central nervous system, and the non-striated, which is controlled by the sympathetic ner- vous system and is found in the skin, in the walls of the digestive tract, the blood-vessels and lymphatics, and in connection with the genito-urinary apparatus. In the walls of the heart a muscle tissue occurs which is frequently re- garded as a third form, characterized by being under con- trol of the sympathetic system and yet being striated; it is, however, in its origin, much more nearly allied to the non-striated than to the striated form of tissue, and will be considered a variety of the former. The Histogenesis of Non-striated Muscular Tissue.â€” Non-striated muscular tissue is formed by the direct con- version of mesenchyme cells into muscle-fibers, the exact details of the conversion being as yet unknown. The fibers are sometimes more or less scattered in the general connective tissue or may be grouped into small bundles or into layers. They are formed from the mesenchyme of the somatic and splanchnic layers of the mesoderm, but appa- rently never from the mesodermic somites. The cells from which the heart musculature develops are at first of the usual well defined embryonic type, but, as development proceeds, they become irregularly stellate in form, the processes of neighboring cells fuse and, even-

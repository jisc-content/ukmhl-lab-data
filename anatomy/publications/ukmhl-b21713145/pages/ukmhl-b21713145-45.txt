31 THE FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM. the process is essentially typical, but in at least 75 per cent, of the ova examined only one polar globule could be ob- served. In the remaining 25 per cent, two polar globules occurred, the twelve chromosomes again dividing trans- versely, so that the second polar globule and the ovum each received twelve chromosomes and the reduction was typical. Recent observations, however, favor the idea that no real deviation from the normal reduction phenomena occurs in the ovum of the mouse. Gerlach holds that the failure of the second polar globule does not indicate the non-occur- rence of the second maturation mitosis, but merely that this, owing to the late entrance of a spermatozoon develops in such a plane or in such a position that the pole of the spindle does not reach the surface of the ovum, the polar globule, consec|uently, not being extruded, but remaining within the ovum, where its chromosomes later degenerate. Kirkham, however, goes even farther, and maintains that the second polar globule is formed in all fertilized ova, the first one in the meantime, however, having escaped through the zona pellucida in the majority of the ova, so that the appearance of but a single globule is presented. If this last view be correct then the maturation phenomena of the mouse's ovum are perfectly typical. The Fertilization of the Ovum.â€”It is perfectly clear that the reduction of the chromosomes in the germ cells cannot very long be repeated in successive generations unless a restoration of the original number takes place occasion- ally, and, as a matter of fact, such a restoration occurs at the very beginning of the development of each individual, being brought about by the union of a spermatozoon with an ovum. This union constitutes what is known as the fertilisation of the ovum. The fertilization of the human ovum has not yet been observed, but the phenomenon has been repeatedly studied

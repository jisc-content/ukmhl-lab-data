DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPLEEN. vessels gain access to the organ. The cells differentiate themselves into trabeculse and pulp cords, special collections of lymphoid cells around the branches of the splenic artery forming the Malpighian corpuscles. It has already been pointed out (p. 238) that during embry- onic life the spleen is an important haematopoietic organ, both red and white corpuscles undergoing active formation within its substance. The Malpighian corpuscles are collections of lymphocytes in which multiplication takes place, and while nothing is as yet known as to the fate of the cells which are contributed to the spleen from the coelomic epithelium, since they quickly come to resemble the mesenchyme cells with which they are associated, yet the growing number of observations Fig. 161.—Section through the Left Layer of the Mesogastrium OF A Chick Embryo of Ninety-three Hours, showing the Origin of the Spleen. ep, Coelomic epithelium; fns, mesenchyme.— (Tonkoff.) indicating an epithelial origin for lymphocytes suggests the possibility that the cells in question may be responsible forjhe first leukocytes of the .spleen. The Coccygeal or Luschka's Ganglion.—In embryos of about 15 cm. there is to be found on the ventral surface of the apex of the coccyx a small oval group of polygonal cells, clearly separated from the surrounding tissue by a mesen- chymal capsule. Later, connective-tissue trabeculas make their way into the mass, which thus becomes divided into lobules, and, at the same time, a rich vascular supply, de- rived principally from bi'anches of the middle sacral artery,

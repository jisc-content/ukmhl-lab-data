99 THE MEDULLARY GROOVE. By this process the medullary groove becomes converted into a medullary canal which later becomes the central canal of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain, thg ectodermal walls of the canal thickening to give rise to the central nervous system. The closure of the groove does not, however, take place simultaneously along its entire length, but begins in what corresponds to the neck region Fig. 56.â€”Diagrams showing the Manner of the Closure of the Medullary Groove. of the adult (Fig. 41) and thence proceeds both anteriorly and posteriorly, the extension of the fusion taking place rather slowly, however, especially anteriorly, so that an anterior opening into the otherwise closed canal can be distinguished for a considerable period (Fig. 42). While these changes have been taking place in the ecto- derm of the median line of the embryonic disk, modifica- tions of the subjacent endoderm have also occurred. This endoderm, it- will be remembered, was formed by the head

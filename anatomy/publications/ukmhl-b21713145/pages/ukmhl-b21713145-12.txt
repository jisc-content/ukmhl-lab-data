PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. Vlll The short bibHographies appended to eacli chapter make no pretensions to completeness, but are merely indications of some of the more important works, especially those of recent date, which consider the questions discussed. For a very full bibliography of all works treating of human embryology up to 1893 reference may be made to Minot's Bibliography of Vertebrate Embryology, published in the " Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History," volume iv, 1893. It is fitting, however, to acknowledge an especial indebtedness, shared by all writers on human embryology, to the classic papers of His, chief among which is his Anatomic menschlicher Embryonen, and grate- ful acknowledgments are also due to the admirable text- books of Minot, O. Hertwig, and KoUmann. Anatomical Laboratory, University of Michigan. October i, 1902.

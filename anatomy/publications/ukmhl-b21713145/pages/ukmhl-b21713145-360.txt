All that portion of the mesentery which is attached to the part of the intestine which will later become the jejunum, ileum, ascending- and transverse colon, is attached to the body- wall at the apex of the funnel, at a point which lies to the left of the duodenum. Up to this stage or to about the middle of the fourth month the mesentery has retained its attachment to the median line of the dorsal wall of the abdomen throughout A £ Fig. 192.—Diagrams Illustrating the Development of the Great Omentum and the Transverse Mesocolon. bid, Caecum; dd, small intestine; dg, yolk-stalk; di, colon; du, duode- num ; gc, greater curvature of stomach; gg, bile duct; gn, meso- gastriuni; k, point where the loops of the intestine cross; mc, mesocolon; md, rectum; mes, mesentery; wf, vermiform appendix. — {Herhvig.) its entire length, but later fusions of certain portions occur, whereby the original condition is greatly modified. One of the earliest of these fusions takes place at the apex of the funnel, where the portion of the mesentery which passes to the transverse colon and arches over the duode- num fuses with the ventral surface of the latter portion of the intestine and also with the peritoneum covering the

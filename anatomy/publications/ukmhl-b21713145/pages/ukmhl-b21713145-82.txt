68 DEVELOPMENT OF EXTERNAL FORM. ft on the surface furthest away from the uterine cavity, was considerably thicker, than elsewhere, forming an area of attachment of the embryo to the wall of the ovum. In the substance of this thickening was the amniotic cavity (am), whose roof was formed by flattened cells, which, at the sides, became continuous with a layer of columnar cells forming the floor of the cavity and constituting the em- bryonic ectoderm (ec). Immediately below this was a layer Fig. 36.â€”Diagrams to show the Probable Relationships of the Parts in the Embryos Represented in Figs. 28, C, and 35. Ac, Amniotic cavity; C, extra-embryonic body-cavity; Me, (in figure to the left) mesoderm, (in figure to the right) somatic mesoderm; Me', splanchnic mesoderm; D, digestive tract; En, endoderm; T, trophoblast. The broken line in the mesoderm of the figure to the left indicates the line along which the splitting of the meso- derm occurs. of mesoderm (in) which split at the edge of the embryonic disk into two layers, one of which became continuous with the mesodermic thickening and so with the layer of meso- derm lining the interior of the trophoderm, while the other enclosed a sac lined by a layer of endodermal cells and termed the yolk-sac (ys). The total length of the embr3ro was aj_9^inni., and so far as its ectoderm and mesoderm are concerned it might be described as a flat disk resting on the surface of the yolk-sac, though it must he understood that

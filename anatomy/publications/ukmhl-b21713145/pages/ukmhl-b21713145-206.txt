192 OSSIFICATION OF BRANCHIAL ARCH SKELETON. Finally, the cartilages of the fourth and fifth branchial arches early fuse together to form a plate of cartilage, and the two plates of opposite sides unite by their ventral edges to form the thyreoid cartilage of the larynx. Fig. io8.â€”Diagram showing the Categories to which the Bones OF the Skull Belong. The unshaded bones are membrane bones, the heavily shaded repre- sent the chondrocranium, while the black represents the branchial arch elements. AS, Alisphenoid; ExO, exoccipital; F, frontal; Hy, hyoid; IP, interparietal; Z, zygomatic; Mn, mandible; Mx, maxilla; NA, nasal; P, parietal; Pe, periotic; SO, snpraoccipital; Sq, squamosal; St, styloid process; Th, thyreoid cartilage; Ty, tympanic. The accompanying diagram (Fig. io8) shows the vari- ous structures derived from the branchial arch skeleton, as

411 THE BRAIN. aficr-hrain {my). From each of these six divisions de- finite structures arise whose relations to the secondary divisions and to the primary vesicles may be understood from the following table and from the annexed figure (Fig. 226), which represents a median longitudinal section of the brain of a fetus of three months.

But while the walls of the primary vesicles undergo this complex differentiation, their cavities retain much more per- fectly their original relations, only that of the first vesicle sharing to any great extent the modifications of the walls. The cavity of the third vesicle persists in the adult as the fourth ventricle, traversing all the subdivisions of the vesi- cle; that of the second, increasing but little in height and breadth, constitutes the aqiucductus cerebri; while that of the first vesicle is continued into the cerebral hemispheres to form the lateral ventricles, the remainder of it constituting

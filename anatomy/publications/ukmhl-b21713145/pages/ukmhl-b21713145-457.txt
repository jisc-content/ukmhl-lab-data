TI-IE CRANIAL NERVES. 443 the homologies of the system in the spinal nerves, for since the spheno-palatine ganglion is to be regarded as part of the sympathetic system, the sensory fibers which pass from the viscera to the spinal cord by way of the sympathetic system (p. 448) present relations practically identical with those of the palatine nerves. Finally, with regard to the system of the lateral line, there seems but little doubt that it has no representation whatso- ever in the spinal nerves. It is associated with a peculiar system of cutaneous sense-organs found only in aquatic or marine animals, and also with the auditory and possibly the olfactory organs, the former of which are certainly and the latter possibly primarily parts of the lateral line system of organs. The organs are principally confined to the head, although they also extend upon the trunk, where they are followed by a branch from the vagus nerve, the entire system being accordingly supplied by cranial nerves. In the fishes, in which the development of the organs is at a maximum, fibers belonging to the system are found in all the branchio- meric nerves and all converge to a portion of the medulla known as the tubcradum acusticum. In the Mammalia, with the disappearance of the lateral line organs there has been a disappearance of the associated nerves, and the only certain representative of the system which persists is the auditory nerve. The table given on page 439 may now be expanded as follows, though it must be recognized that such an analysis of the mammalian nerves is merely a deduction from what has been observed in lower forms, and may require some modifications when the components have been subjected to actual observation:

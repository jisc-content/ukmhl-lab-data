147 PART 11. ORGANOGENY. CHAPTER VI. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM. The Development of the Skin.â€”The skin is composed of two embryologically distinct portions, the outer epidermal layer being developed from the ectoderm, while the dermal layer is mesenchymatous in its origin. The ectoderm covering the general surface of the body is, in the earliest stages of development, a single layer of cells, but at the end of the first month it is composed of two layers, an outer one, the epitrichium, consisting of slightly flattened cells, and a lower one whose cells are larger and which will give rise to the epidermis (Fig. 78, A). During the second month the differences between the two layers become more pronounced, the epitrichial cells assuming a characteristic domed form and becoming vesicular in struc- ture (Fig. 78, B). These cells persist until about the sixth month of development, but after that they are cast off, and, becoming mixed with the secretion of sebaceous glands which have appeared by this time, form a constituent of the vernix caseosa. In the meantime changes have been taking place in the epidermal layer which result in its becoming several layers thick (Fig. 78, B), the innermost layer being composed of cells rich in protoplasm while those of the outer layers are

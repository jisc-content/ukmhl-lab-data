246 THE FORMATION OF THE HEART. the£oof of the cavity. This is the ajrialse^m or se^Jum_ primum (Fig. 134, ss), and it rapidly increases in size and thickens_upon its_ free margin, which reaches^almost to the upper border_oLthe_s]wt_atrial canal (Fig. 136). The continuity of the two atria is thus almost dissolved, but is so^^rcr established by the formation in the dorsal part of the septum of an^ opening which soon reaches a considerable size and is known as the foramen ovale (Fig. 133, fo). Close to the atrial septum, and parallel with it, a second ridge appears in the roof and ventral wall of the right atrium. This septum secundum {S2) is from the beginning very much thicker than the atrial septum, and Jts. fre^ edge, arching around the ventral edge and floor of the fora- men ovale, becomes continuous with the left lip of the fold which guards the opening of the sinus venosus and with this forms the annulus of Vieussens of the adult heart. When the absorption of the sinus venosus into the wall of the right atrium has proceeded so far that the veins com- municate directly with the atrium, the vena cava superior opens into it at the upper part of the dorsal wall, the vena cava inferior more laterally, and below this is the smaller opening of the coronary sinus. The upper portion of the right lip of the fold which originally surrounded the open- ing of the sinus venosus, toother with the septum spurium, gradually disappears ; the lower portion persists, however, Fig. 135.—Heart of Em- bryo OF 10.2 CM.

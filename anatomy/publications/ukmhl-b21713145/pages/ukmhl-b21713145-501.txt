487 THE IRIS AND CILIARY BODY. folds in the region of the corpus ciHare persist and produce the ciliary processes of the adult eye. Embedded in the substance of the iris stroma in the adult are non-striped muscle-fibers, which constitute the sphtjtclejr, and dilatator iridis. It has long been supposed that these fibers'^vere differentiated from the stroma of the iris, but recent observations have shown that they arise from the cells Fig. 264.—Radial Section through the Iris of an Embryo of 19 CM.

The Development of the Retina.—Throughout the retinal region of the cup the pigment layer, undergoing the same changes as in the ciliary region, forms the pigment layer

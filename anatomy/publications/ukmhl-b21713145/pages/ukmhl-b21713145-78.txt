64 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GERM LAYERS. principally nutritive functions. In certain of the lower invertebrates, the class Coelentera, the differentiation does not proceed beyond this diploblastic stage, but in all higher forms the intermediate layer is also developed, and with its appearance'^a further division of the functions of the organ- > ism supervenes, the ectoderm, situated upon the outside of / the body, assuming the relational functions, the endoderm I becoming still more exclusively nutritive, while the remain- I ing functions, supportive, excretory, locomotor, reproduc- I tive, etc., are assumed by the mesoderm.^ The manifold adaptations of development obscure in cer- tain cases the fundamental relations of the three layers, certain portions of the mesoderm, for instance, failing to differentiate simultaneously with the rest of the layer and appearing therefore to be a portion of either the ectoderm or endoderm. But, as a rule, the layers are structural units of a higher order than the cells, and since each assumes definite physiological functions, definite structures have their origin from each. Thus from the ectoderm there develop: 1. The epidermis and its appendages, hairs, nails, epi- dermal glands, and the enamel of the teeth. 2. The epithelium lining the mouth and the nasal cavities, as well as that lining the lower part of the rectum. 3. The nervous system and the nervous elements of the sense-organs, together with the lens of the eye. From the endoderm develop : 1. The epithelium lining the digestive tract in general, together with that of the various glands associated with it, such as the liver and pancreas. 2. The lining epithelium of the larynx, trachea, and lungs. 3. The epithelium of the bladder and urethra (in part). From the mesoderm there are formed: I. The various connective tissues, including bone and the teeth (except the enamel).

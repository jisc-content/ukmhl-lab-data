256 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. in terrestrial animals, with the loss of the gills and the devel- opment of the lungs as respiratory organs, the capillaries of the gills disappear and the afferent and efferent branchial vessels become continuous, the condition represented in the diagram resulting. But this condition is merely temporary in the mammalia and numerous changes occur in the arrangement of the vessels before the adult plan is realized. The first change is a disappearance of the vessel of the first arch, thejventral stem from which it arose being continued forward to form the temporal arteries, giving off near the point where the branchial vessel originally arose a branch which represents the internal maxillary artery in part, and possibly also a sec- ond branch which represents the external maxillary (His). A little later the second branchial vessel also degenerates (Fig. 142), a branch arising from the ventral trunk near its former origin, possibly representing the future lingual artery (His), and then the portion of the dorsal trunk which intervenes between the third and fourth braiichial vessels vanishes, so that the dorsal trunk anterior to the third branchial arch is cut off from its connection with the dorsal aorta and forms, together with the vessel of the third arch, the internal carotid, while the veiitral trunk, anterior to the point of origin of the third vessel, becomes the exter- n"al carotid, and the portion which intervenes between the third and fourth vessels becomes the common carotid (Fig. 143)- The rudimentary fifth vessel, like the first and second, disappears, but the fourth persists to form the aortic arch, there being at this stage of development two complete aortic arches. From the sixth vessel a branch arises which passes backward to the lungs, forming the pulmonary artery, and the portion of the vessel of the right side which intervenes between this and the aortic arch disappears, while the corre-

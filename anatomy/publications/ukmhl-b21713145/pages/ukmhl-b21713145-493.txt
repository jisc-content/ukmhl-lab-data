479 THE EYE. it soon shows a differentiation into a terminal bulb and a stalk connecting the bulb with the brain (Fig. 225). At an early stage the bulb comes into apposition with the ecto- derm of the side of the head, and this, over the area of con-^ tact, becomes thickened and then depressed to form the beginning of the future lens (Fig. 259). As the result of the depression of the lens ectoderm, the outer wall of the optic bulb becomes pushed inward toward the inner wall, and this invagination continuing until the Fig. 260.—Reconstruction qf the Brain of an Embryo of Four Weeks, showing the Chorioid Fissure.—(His.) two walls come into contact, the bulb is transformed into a double-walled cup, the optic cup, in the mouth of which lies the lens (Fig. 261). The cup is not perfect, however, since the invagination affects not only the optic bulb, but also extends medially on the posterior surface of the stalk, forming upon this a longitudinal groove and producing a defect of the ventral wall of the cup, known as the chorioidal fissure (Fig, 260). The groove and fissure become occu- pied l)y mesodermal tissue, and in this, at about the fifth

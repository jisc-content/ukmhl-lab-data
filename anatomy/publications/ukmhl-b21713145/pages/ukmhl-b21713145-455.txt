441 THE CRANIAL NERVES. cutaneous sense-organs largely developed in the fishes and known as the organs of the lateral line. The fibers of the somatic sensory system converge to a group of cells, situated in the lateral part of the floor of the fourth ventricle and forming what is termed the tri- geminal lobe, and also extend posteriorly in the substance of the medulla (Fig. 240), forming what has been termed the spinal root of the trigeminus and terminating in a column of cells which represents the forward continuation of the posterior horn of the cord. In the fishes and am- phibia fibers belonging to this system are to be found in the fifth, seventh, and tenth nerves, but in the mammalia their distribution has apparently become more limited, being con- fined almost exclusively to the trigeminus, of whose sensory divisions they form a very considerable part. Since the cells around which the fibers of the spinal root of the tri- geminus terminate are the forward continuations of the pos- terior horns of the cord, it seems probable that the fibers of this system are the cranial representatives of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, which, it may be noted, are also somatic in their distribution. The fibers of the viscero-sensory system are found in the lower forms principally in the ninth and tenth nerves (see Fig. 240), although groups of them are also incorporated in the seventh and fifth. They converge to a mass of cells, known as the lobus vagi, and like the first set are also con- tinued down the medulla to form a tract known as the fas- ciculus solitarius or fasciculus communis. In the mammalia the system is represented by the sensory fibers of the glosso- pharyngeo-vagus set of nerves, of which it represents prac- tically the entire mass; by the sensory fibers of the facial arising from the geniculate ganglion and included in the chorda tympani and probably also the great superficial petrosal; and also, probably, by the lingual branch of the

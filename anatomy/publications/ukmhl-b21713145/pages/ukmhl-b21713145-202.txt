The Membrane Bones of the Skull.â€”In the membrane forming the sides and roof of the skull in the second stage of its development ossifications appear, which give rise, in addition to the interparietal and squamosal bones already- mentioned in connection with the occipital and temporal, to the parietals and frontal. Each of the former bones de- velops from a single center which appears at the end of the eighth week, while the frontal is formed at about the same time from two centers situated symmetrically on each side of the median line and eventually fusing completely to form a single bone, although more or less distinct indica- tions of a median suture, the metopic, are not infrequently present. Furthermore, ossifications appear in the mesenchyme of the facial region to form the nasal, lachrymal, and zygomatic bones, all of which arise from single centers of ossification, [n the case of each zygomatic bone, however, three osseous thickenings appear on the inner surface of the original ossi-

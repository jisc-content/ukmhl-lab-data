230 THE LIMB MUSCLES. flexor tendons. The fourth layer partly assumes a longitu- dinal direction and becomes the tibialis posterior and the flexor hallucis longus and partly retains its original oblique direction and its connection with the deep layers of the plantar aponeurosis, becoming the quadratus plantae. In the foot (Fig. 123, B) the superficial layer persists as mus- cular tissue, forming the abductors, the flexor digitorum Fig. 123.â€”Transverse sections through (A) the crus and (B) the foot, showing- the arrangement of the layers of the flexor muscles. The shading has the same significance as in the preceding figure. AbH, abductor hallucis; AhM, abductor minimi digiti; AdH, adductor hallucis; ELD, extensor longus digitorum; F, fibula; FBD, flexor brevis digitorum; FBH, flexor brevis hallucis; FBM, flexor brevis minimi digiti; FLD, flexor longus digitorum; G, gastrocnemius; ID, interossei dorsalis; IV, interossei ventrales; L, lumbricales; P, plantaris; Pe, peroneus longus; Po, popliteus; S, soleus; T, tibia; TA, tibialis anticus; TP, tibialis posticus; I-V, first to fifth metatarsal. brevis and the medial head of the flexor hallucis brevis, the second and third layers become respectively the lumbricales, the lateral head of the flexor hallucis brevis and the adduc- tor hallucis, while the fourth and fifth layers together form the interossei, as in the hand, the flexor quinti digiti brevis really belonging to that group of muscles.

As develop- ment proceeds the number of layers increases and the super- ficial ones, undergoing a horny degeneration, give rise to the stratum corneum, while the deeper ones become the stratum Malpighii. At about the fourth month ridges develop on the under surface of the epidermis, projecting downward into the dermis (Fig. 84), and later secondary ridges appear in the intervals between the primary ones, while on the Fig. 78.â€”A, Section of Skin from the Dorsum of Finger of an Embryo of 4.5 cm.; B, from the Plantar Surface of the Foot OF an Embryo of 10.2 cm. et, Epitrichium; cp, epidermis. palms and soles ridges appear upon the outer surface of the epidermis, corresponding in position to the primary ridges of the under surface. The mesenchyme which gives rise to the dermis grows in from all sides between the epidermis and the outer layer of the myotomes, which are at first in contact, and forms a continuous layer underlying the epidermis and showing no indications of a segmental arrangement. It becomes con-

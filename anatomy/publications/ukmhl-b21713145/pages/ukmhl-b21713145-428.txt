In embryos of about 9 mm. the differentiation of the dorsal and ventral zones into ependymal and mantle layers is clearly visible (Fig-. 227), and in. the ventral zone the marginal velum is also well developed Where^the fibers from the sensory ganglion of the^vagus nerve enter thT dorsal zone an^oyal area (Fig. 227, fs) is to be seen which is evidently comparable to the oval bundle of the cord and Fig. 227.—Transverse Section through the Medulla Oblongata OF .AN Embryo of 9.1 mm. rf^, Dorsal zone; fp, floor-plate; fs, fasciculus solitarius; /, lip; rp, roof- plate; V2, ventral zone; X and XII, tenth and twelfth nerves.— (His.) consequently with the fasciculus of Burdach. It gives rise to the solitary fasciculus of adult anatomy, and in embryos of II to 13 mm. it becomes covered in by the fusion of the reflected lip of the dorsal zone with the sides of the myelen- cephalon^ this fusion, at the same time, drawing the mar- gins of the roof-plate ventrally to form a secondary lip (Fig. 228). Soon after this a remarkable migration ven- trally of neuroblasts of the dorsal zonebegins. Increasing

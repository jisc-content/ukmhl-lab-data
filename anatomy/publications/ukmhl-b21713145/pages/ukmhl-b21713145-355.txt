THE DIAPHRAGM. posterior surface of the upper layer and below to the ante- rior surface of the liver, beyond which it is continued down the ventral wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus (Fig. 189, C, Ls). This is the falciform ligament of the liver of adult anatomy, and in the free edge of its prolongation clown the ventral wall of the abdomen the umbilical vein passes to the under surface of the liver, while the free edge of that por- tion which lies between the liver and the digestive tract con- tains the omphalo-mesenteric (portal) vein, the common bile-duct, and the hepatic artery. The diagram given in Fig. 184 will, it is hoped, make clear the mode of formation and the relation of this fold, which, in its entirety, consti- tutes what is sometimes termed the ventral mesentery. And not only do the grooves fail to unite in the median line, but they also fail to completely separate the liver from the upper layer of the septum dorsally, the portion of the lower layer which persists in this region forming the coro- imr^ %am^2^^/_of the liver. The portion of the lower^ layer which forms the roof of the grooves becomes the layer of peritoneum covering the posterior surface of the upper layer (which represents the diaphragm), while^tjie portion which remains connected with the liver constitutes its jDeritoiieal investment. In the meantime changes have been taking place in the upper layer. As the rotation of the heart occurs, so that its atrial portion comes to lie anterior to the ventricle, the Cuvierian ducts are drawn away from the septum and l^nf*£ate the posterior wall of the pericardium, the se£a- ration iDeing assisted by Jhe continued descent _oTjhe~ at:: *3.9hment of the edge of the septum to the ventral wall of the body. During the descent, when the upper layer of the septum has reached the level of the fourth cervical seg- ment, portions of the myotomes of that segmenTbecoiTie prolonged into it and the layer assumes the characteristics

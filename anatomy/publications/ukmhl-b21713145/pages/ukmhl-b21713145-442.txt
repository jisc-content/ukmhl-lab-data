428 THE TELENCEPHALON. posterior horns extending backward into the occipital por- tions of the hemispheres, these portions, on account of the greater persistence of the mid-brain flexure (see p. 412), being enabled to develop to a greater extent than in the lower mammals. The scheme of the origin of parts in the telencephalon may be stated as follows: Median Part. Hemispheres. Roof-plate, { Anterior part of Velum r Floor of chorioidal fis- interpositum. \ sure. Dorsal zones, •• • | Ventral zones, .. -= Lamina terminalis. Optic evaginations. Anterior part of hypo- thalamic region. Anterior part of tuber cinereum. Pallium. Corpus striatum.. Olfactory lobes (see p. 433). The Convolutions of the Hemispheres.—The growth of the hemispheres to form the voluminous structures found in the adult depends mainly upon an increase of size of the jpallium. The corpus striatum, although it takes part in the elongation of each hemisphere, nevertheless does not increase in other directions as rapidly and extensively as the pallium, and hence, even in very early stages, a depres- sion appears upon the surface of the hemispheres where the corpus is situated (Fig. 275). This depression is the lateral cerebral fossa, and for a considerable period it is the only sign of inequality of growth on the outer surfaces of the hemispheres. Upon the mesial surfaces, however, at about the time that the chorioid fissure appears, another linear depression is formed dorsal to the chorioid, and when fully formed extends from in front of the interventricular fora- men to the tip of the temporal lobe (Fig. 237, h). It affects ■

THE LIMB MUSCLES. 221 this presenting a distinctly segmental arrangement. This does not necessarily imply, however, a corresponding pri- marily metameric arrangement of the muscles, any more than the pronouncedly segmental arrangement of the cuta- neous nerves implies a primary metamerism of the dermis (see p. 148). It may mean only that the nerves, being seg- mental, retain their segmental relations to one another even in their distribution to non-metameric structures, and that, consequently, the limb musculature is supplied in succes- sion from one border of the limb bud to the other from succeeding nerve roots. But whether further observation may prove or disprove the myotomic origin of the limb musculature, the fact re- mains that it possesses a segmentally arranged innervation, and it is possible, therefore, to recognize in the limb buds a series of parallel bands of muscle tissue, extending longi- tudinally along the bud and each supplied by a definite seg- mental nerve. And furthermore, corresponding to each band upon the ventral (prjeaxial) surface of the limb bud, there is a band similarly innervated upon the dorsal (post- axial) surface, since the fibers which pass to the limb from each nerve root sooner or later arrange themselves in prie- axial and postaxial groups as is shown in the diagram Fig. 118. The first nerve which enters the limb bud lies along its anterior border, and consequently the muscle bands wdiich are supplied by it will, in the adult, lie along the outer side of the arm and along the inner side of the leg, in consequence of the rotation in opposite directions which the limbs undergo during development (see p. 91). The first nerve which supplies the muscles attached to the dorsum of the ilium is the second lumbar, and follow- ing that there come successively from before backward the remaining lumbar and the first and second sacral nerves. The arrangement of the muscle bands supplied by these

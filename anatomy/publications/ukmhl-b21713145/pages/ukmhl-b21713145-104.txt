90 DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIMBS. A furrow or constriction appears at the junction of the flattened and cyhndrical portions (Fig. 47), and later a second constriction divides the cyhndrical portion into a proximal and distal moiety, the three segments of each limb —the arm, forearm, and hand in the upper limb, and the thigh, leg, and foot in the lower—being thus marked out. The digits are first indicated by the development of four radiating shallow grooves upon the hand and foot regions, and a transverse furrow uniting the proximal ends of the digital furrows indicates the junction of the digital and palmar regions of the hand or of the toes and body of the foot. After this stage is reached the development of the upper limb proceeds more rapidly than that of the lower, although the processes are essentially the same in both limbs. The digits begin to project slightly, but are at first to a very considerable extent united together by a web, whose further growth, however, does not keep pace with that of the digits, which thus come to project more and more in later stages. Even in comparatively early stages the thumb, and to a- somewhat slighter extent the great toe, is widely separated from the second digit (Figs. 49 and 50). While these changes have been taking place the entire limbs have altered their position with reference to the axis of the body, being in stages later than that shown in Fig. 47 directed ventrally so that their longitudinal axes are at right angles to that of the body. From the figures of later stages it may be seen that it is the thumb (radial) side of the arm and the great toe (tibial) side of the leg which are directed fonvard; the plantar and palmar surfaces of the feet and hands are turned toward the body and the elbow is directed outward and slightly backward, while the knee looks outward and slightly forward. It seems proper to conclude that the radial side of the arm is homologous with the tibial side of the leg, the palmar surface of the hand

THE TRUNK MUSCULATURE. 212 and the psoas, which He beneath the vertebral column and hence have been termed hyposkeletal muscles (Huxley). More ventrally three sheets of muscles, lying one above the other, are formed, the fibers of each sheet being arranged in a definite direction differing from that found in the other sheets. In the abdomen there are thus fonned the two oblique and the transverse muscles, in the thorax the inter- costals and the trans versus thoracis, while in the neck these portions of some of the myotomes disappear, those of the remainder giving rise to the scaleni muscles, portions of the trapezius and sternomastoid (Bolk), and possibly the hyo- glossus and styloglossus. In the abdominal region, and to a considerable extent in the neck also, the various portions of myotomes fuse together, but in the thorax they retain in the intercostals their original distinctness, being separated by the ribs. The table on page 213 will show the relation of the various trunk muscles to the portions of the myotomes. The intimate association between the pelvic girdle and the axial skeleton brings about extensive modifications of the posterior trunk myotomes. So far as their dorsal por- tions are concerned probably all these myotomes as far back as the fifth sacral are represented in the sacro-spinalis, but the ventral portions from the first lumbar myotome on- wards are greatly modified. The last myotome taking part in the formation of the rectus abdominis is the twelfth thoracic and the last to be represented in the lateral muscu- lature of the abdomen is the first lumbar, the ventral por- tions of the remaining lumbar and of the first and second sacral myotomes either having disappeared or being devoted to the formation of the musculature of the lower limb. The ventral portions of the third and fourth sacral myo- tomes are represented, however, by the levator ani and coccy- geus, and are the last myotomes which persist as muscles

Structure of Kidney ;45 quickly expand into calyces which, embracing the tops of the pyramids, collect the urine. (For ureter^ see p. 349.) The function of the kidney is to get rid of the excess of water, with, of course, certain excrementitious substances in solution ; it is thus closely associated with the skin, with the mucous membrane of the bowel, and to a certain extent with the lungs. When the diseased kidney demands rest the skin and the bowels should be set to work by diaphoretics and purgatives. When a patient with acute intestinal obstruction is constandy vomiting there is little or no fluid for the kidney to drain off, and suppression of urine is noted ; and when a man is perspiring profusely, or is racked with diarrhoea or cholera, he passes hardly any urine. That which comes away in such cases is laden with excrementitious materials and is consequently of high specific gravity. Structure.â€”The cortical part consists of branching and coiled tubules, and of ramifications of blood-vessels, in which the bases of the twelve or twenty pyramids of the viedultary part are received. These pyramids consist of parallel bundles of uriniferous tubules, and are partially separated from one another by offshoots of the cortical part, through which the blood-vessels pass outwards from the hilum.

A uriniferous tubule begins in the cortex in a dilatation like a Florence flask (Malpighian capsule), in which a branch of artery and vein form a tuft {glomerulus), from which the watery part of the urine transudes, to escape at last by the apex of the pyramid (papilla) into the sinus of the ureter. The tubule has a continuous epithelial lining. Blood in the urine may be due to rupture of the engorged vascular

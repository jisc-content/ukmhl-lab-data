Develop7iient 124 arches through which the cervical epiblast blends with the pharyn- geal hypoblast. From the first cleft the Eustachian tube and tym- panum are developed, the meatus auditorius grows from its hinder end, and the pinna from the neighbouring integument (p. 102). Branchial fistulae may be found in the middle line of the neck, where the lateral arches have failed to meet, and down the side of the neck, by the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, where the blending of the adjacent arches has been imperfect. Their most common situations are shown in the adjacent sketch, which has been kindly lent by Mr. Bland Sutton, to whose Lectures in the ' Lancet' of 1888 the reader will do well to refer. These fistulas lead by slender canals deeply into the neck, towards the pharynx, with which they were originally continuous. Sometimes they are in symmetrical pairs. Paget has noticed that their secretion is aug- mented during bron- chial or nasal catarrh. Occasionally a small pendulous nodule of skin, or of skin and cartilage, marks part of the line of closure of one of the clefts, just as nodules grow at the end of the first post-oral fissure to form the pin- na, and sometimes a similar nodule persists in the middle line as a clumsy representative of a needless raphe, by way of evidence of the fusion of the plates in the middle line. Dermoid cysts, which are frequently found in the face, neck, and pinna, are due to pieces of the epiblast in some of the clefts having been closed in externally ; their epidermal lining secreting a seba- ceous material, the cysts become conspicuous, and may in due course demand removal. Sometimes the cysts contain hair and sebaceous glands.

357 Lumbar Plexus caries of that bone inflammatory pressure upon the posterior root of the nerve is manifested by definite peripheral neuralgiasâ€”the patient complaining of pains in the front of the belly, in each groin, or over the hips. The second nerve sends down a branch to the third, and divides into the genito-crural and the external cutaneous, each of which, doubt- less, derives a few filaments from the descending branch of the first. The genito-crural descends on the front of the psoas, and breaks into a genital and a crural division. The genital branch passes down upon the external iliac artery, and eventually leaves the abdomen through the inguinal canal, ending in the supply of the cremaster, or over the round ligament. ' Retraction of the testis' (p. 349) is effected through the influence of this nerve. The crural branch passes beneath Poupart's ligament and through the front of the crural sheath and the fascia lata, and supplies the skin over the outer part of Scarpa's triangle. C. WITH 121" DORSAL.. The external cutaneous comes through the outer side of the psoas, creeps beneath the iliac fascia, and emerges from the pelvis iDelow the outer end of Poupart's ligament. Then, slowly piercing the fascia lata, it gives cutaneous branches to the buttock and to the outer aspect of the thigh as low as the knee. The third and fourth nerves, with the twig from the second, com- bine to give off" the anterior crural and the obturator.

Disease of Spine 212 Fracture of spine ; cord lacerated. (A. Shaw.) no messages can proceed from the brain to the muscles which are sup- pHed by nerves coming off below the injured spot ; sensation also is lost (j-^^ p. 216). And the trophic influence for the skin being lost, bed-sores are very apt to appear. The pa- tient, therefore, with a broken back, is placed upon a water- bed, so that the weight of his body may be distributed evenly, and not fall upon the prominent parts only. The bladder and the lower bowel do not work properly, be- cause the reflex centre (p. 218) is cut off from cerebral control, and retention of urine and cystitis probably occur, possibly the man has priapism (p. 216), and the reflexes, as explained on page 219, are most likely exaggerated. The least touch upon the sole may cause violent contractions in the quadriceps extensor; but if the displacement disorganise the lumbar enlargement these reflexes are then lost, for the chain is broken. They may be lost too for a while when the grey matter has exhausted its energy by frequent discharges. The spijial vei7ts consist of a ladder- like network about the neural arches of the vertebrae ; of anterior longitudinal veins, which lie be- hind the bodies and receive the venae basis vertebras ; of posterior longitudi- nal veins, which are also outside the dura mater, and which extend along the back of the cord; and, lastly, of the veins of the cord itself, which pierce the dura mater,

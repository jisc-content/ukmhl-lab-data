294 The Abdomen PART IV THE ABDOMEN The transverse measurement of the abdomen {abdo^ I conceal) is greater below than it is just beneath the diaphragmâ€”and especially so in women ; but in children, on account of the imperfect development of the pelvis, the superior transverse diameter is the greater. The boundaries are, laterally and anteriorly, the false ribs and diaphragm, and the oblique, transverse, and straight muscles ; pos- teriorly, the lumbar spine, the diaphragm, the lower ribs, quadratus lumborum, and the lamelte of the transverse muscle. The expanded ilia also help to enclose the cavity and support the viscera. Though the diaphragm affords a definite limit above, the abdomen is separated from the pelvic cavity only by the shifting planes of peri- toneum, which, under the name of false ligaments, slope to the bladder and rectum. Were the partition between the abdominal and pelvic cavities less movable, the ascent of the distended bladder and of the pregnant uterus would be impeded, and the descent of the coils of small intestine into the pelvis, when those viscera are empty, could not take place. In cancer of the oesophagus or pylorus, on account of the emptiness of the alimentary canal, the front of the abdomen is flat; and in tuber- cular meningitis, because of the irritability of the nervous system, the bowels being empty and contracted, the depressed surface of the ab- domen is ' boat-shaped.' For palpation of the abdomejt^ the patient should be lying on his back, with the knees drawn up so that the abdominal wall may be relaxed to the utmost, and when a very thorough examination is to be made, precaution should be taken that the stomach, bowels, and bladder are empty. When a tumour descends with inspiration and rises with expiration its seat is in one of the abdominal-viscera, and not in the abdominal wall. A line drawn around the trunk from the base of the ensiform cartilage to the tenth dorsal spine suggests the upper limit of the abdominal cavity, which ascends a good deal beneath the dome of the diaphragm and under cover of the ribs and the base of the lungs.

i6o TJie Pericardium middle line and compressed, respiration is embarrassed, and the patient is hardly able to move himself in his bed. When the effusion is excessive the lower two-thirds of the sternum, and the left cartilages, from the second to the seventh, are prominent, the intercostal spaces are Avidened, and the area of cardiac dulness is increased. In the young subject, with pliant chest-walls, the bulging is more marked than in the adult. As the patient lies in bed the effusion does not at first increase the area of dulness, because it gravitates to the back of the sacâ€”collecting behind the heart; but as the distension increases the lungs are pushed aside, and the ascitic pericardium bulges against the chest-wall, giving rise to a dull percussion-note as high, perhaps, as the first space, and extending widely behind the right and left cartilages, and the xiphoid. 1^ jS.lv:&^!^ V /4r Effusion into pericardium ; lungs pushed aside ; slight effusion into right pleura, v, vi, vii, ribs in section. (Braune.) The diaphragm, liver, and stomach are, at the same time, thrust downwards. In acute inflammation the sac may contain from twelve to eighteen ounces of serum, but when the disease is chronic the fluid may amount to three pints. In the latter case the left lung would be pushed far out, and the tumour would bulge so much towards the abdomen

Development of Lip 105 ingsofthe superior maxillary processes, which, extending inwards, are eventually fused with the descending flap at a short distance from the median hne. If a unilateral arrest of development take place, a single hare-lip results ; if the arrest be symmetrical, the cleft is double. The labial cleft is thus to the side of the median line, not in it, as it is in the hare. The cleft may extend into the nostril; or may be represented by a mere notch or depression at the border of the lip. Sometimes a small triangular gap is found continuous by its apex with a vertical linear cicatrix, as if Nature herself had attempted a plastic opera- tion with partial success. Hare-lip may be hereditary, several members of the same family being disfigured by it. Often it is associated with cleft palate, and the median piece of the lip may be attached with the inter-maxillary bone to the projecting nasal septum.^ In double hare-lip the inter-maxillary bone should contain the four incisors, but more often it contains three, or two only. Double hare-lip; prsemaxilla attached to tip of nose. Mr. Pitt's case of Median Hare-lip. ^^^^^ process descending to form median part of lip ; a deepening of this notch gives median hare-lip. Fergusson taught that the lateral incisors were then lost in the cleft, but, from development (p. 17), this explanation does not suffice. The median part of the lip descends as a bifid process, and if the gap between its lateral nodules be exaggerated, whilst their outer ' From The Surgical Diseases of Children, Cassell & Co.

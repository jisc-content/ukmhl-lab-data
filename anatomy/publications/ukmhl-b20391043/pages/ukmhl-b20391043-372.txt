The Pelvis 36o PART V THE PELVIS The innominate bone has three primary centres of ossification : for ihum at third month of foetal life, ischium at fourth, and pubes at fifth. During childhood these segments are joined in the acetabulum by a Y-shaped carti- lage, which, becoming softened and disinte- grated in hip-joint disease, readily allows pus to work through into the pelvis. Five secondary ce?itres appear at puberty : in the Y-shaped cartilage (so that the three parts of the bone are soon after fused together); in the iliac crest, which, as a cartilaginous rim, is sometimes detached by violence ; in the anterior inferior iliac spine, which may be torn off by energetic contraction of the rectus femoris, or by direct violence ; in the ischial tuberosity, and at the pubic symphysis. The bone is welded into a solid mass at about the twenty-fifth year. Weaver's bursa.â€”The ischial tuberosity is separated from the gluteus maximus by a large bursa, and in those who sit much, as weavers, tailors, and coachmen, the sac may become inflamed, and may suppurate. The sacro-iliac joint is formed by the auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, each of which is covered with a layer of cartilage. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament is thin, the posterior is thick and strong, and, in addition, contains a large amount of interosseous fibres. The joint is supplied by branches of the gluteal and ilio-lumbar arteries, and by nerves from the superior gluteal, the sacral plexus, and perhaps from the obturator. Disease of the joint may follow injury, or parturition, or may be secondary to spinal caries. The local tenderness may be detected by following the iliac crest round to the sacrum, and pressing below the posterior superior spine. In addition to the constant pain at the bottom of the back, there

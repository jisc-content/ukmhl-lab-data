The Mouth 104 at the front and back of the wound, and the judicious arrangement of strips of waterproof strapping are now taking the place of the pins, the use of which is apt to mark the Hp with permanent scars. Supply.—Below the region of the orbicularis the lower lip receives the submental and inferior labial branches of the facial artery. The coronary branches of the same artery pierce the orl^icularis and form a circle close beneath the mucous membrane. In operating for hare- lip one suture should be passed beneath their cut ends. (There is no superior labial artery : an upper lip which is long enough to need one is an artistic defect.) The infra-orbital artery may help in the supply of the upper lip, and the mental branch of the inferior dental in that of the lower lip. The lymphatics pass to the submaxillary and to the cervical glands. The nerves are derived from the terminations of the superior maxillary and inferior dental trunks ; the mental branch of the inferior dental also helps in the supply of the lower lip.

Development.—The buccal cavity first appears as a depression in the epiblast between the fronto-nasal process above, the superior maxillary processes at the sides, and the mandibular plates (p. 105) below. The mouth is then separated from the pharynx, but the par- tition soon wears away at the region of the fauces. Sometimes the hinder part of the mandibular fissure (M.F., p. 124) fails to be oblite- rated ; a large mouth, macrostoma, then results. Hare-lip.—The median part of the upper lip is formed by a flap which descends, in connection with the fronto-nasal plate, from the front of the cranium ; the lateral parts are developed from the cover-

365 F(£tal Head Thus, at the brim the longest diameter is the transverse, the shortest is the antero-posterior. In the middle plane the oblique dia- meter is the longest, and the shortest is the antero-posterior. At the outlet the antero-posterior is the longest and the transverse the shortest. Axes.—A line, ed^ drawn at right angles to the middle of the superior plane shows the axis of inlet; it extends between the navel and the tip of the coccyx ; the axis of outlet passes from the sacro-vertebral angle through the anus. The spine of the ischium gready influences the direction of the fcetal head during parturition. The foetal head.— Though the base of the foetal skull is solidly developed, to protect important nerves and ganglia, the vault is ex- tremely compressible, the edges of the bones being bevelled, and con- nected by membranous seams, so as to permit overlapping as the head passes through the pelvic straits. Where three or more sutures meet, the membranous seams are wide and conspicuous, and the arterial pulsation which there exists gives those areas the name of fontanelles. There is a fontanelle at each angle of the parietal bone, those in the middle of the coronal and lambdoid sutures being extremely important; by their shape and posi- tion the finger of the obstetrician recognises the kind of head presenta- tion with which he is dealing. {See fig. on p. 366.) The anterior fontanelle is like the ace of diamonds ; the posterior is triangular. The anterior is wide, but the posterior is encroached upon by the close proximity of the corners of the three bones which bound it. In the case of chronic hydrocephalus the anterior fontanelle may not be closed until after puberty. The lateral halves of the frontal bone are connected by a loose suture which extends downwards from the front of the anterior fontanelle ; it is the continuation of the sagitta suture, or conjugate. ob, oblique. tr, transverse.

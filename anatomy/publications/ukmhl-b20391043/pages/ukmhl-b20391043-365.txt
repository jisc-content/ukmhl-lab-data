The splenic runs along the upper border of the pancreas, behind the stomach, and breaks up into several short trunks for the hilum of the spleen and the great end of the stomach (vasa brevia). In its course the splenic gives off the pancreaticse parvas and a pancreatica magna, and a large vessel, the gastro-epiploica sinistra, which runs in the root 4, Abdominal aorta.

N.B. — All the large veins—except the left renal—are posterior to the arte- ries. of the great omentum, to meet the gastro-epiploic branch of the hepatic along the greater curvature of the stomach. The superior mesejiteric comes off close below the coeliac axis, just behind the pancreas and splenic vein, and emerges between the pan- creas and transverse duodenum. It gives off from its right side the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch ; and, passing between the layers A A

Varieties of Hydrocele 429 thighs. The testis is not, like the heart, completely surrounded by the serous tunic; the posterior aspect is covered only by the epididymis. Through the uncovered part of the testis the vessels enter and leave, and through it an incision could be made into the gland without wounding the serous sac. Occasionally the testis is found with the tunica vaginalis at the back and the epididymis in front, but this variation rarely occurs. If, from arrest in the progress of development, obliteration of the funicular process of peritoneum fail to take place, the serous fluid which moistens the general peritoneal cavity may gravitate into the tunica vaginalis, and give rise to a scrotal water-tumour (uSwp, water ; Ky]Ky]^ tumour), a hydrocele. And, as this variety of hydrocele is usually found at, or soon after, birth, it is distinguished by the adjective congrenital; sometimes, however, it first appears in adult life. The contents of this variety of hydrocele can be emptied into the abdominal cavity by placing the patient on his back and raising the scrotum: Congenital Infantile Funicular Encysted Vaginal Varieties of hydrocele. (Ashby and Wright.) but, as soon as he is put once more upright, the fluid comes trickling down into the tunica vaginalis. Injecting such a hydrocele for radical treatment might set up an extensive and uncontrollable peritonitis. Treatment can only be expectant; the obliteration of the funicular process being aided by the constant pressure of a well-fitting truss. It is not in itself a serious condition, but, by maintaining the patency of the funicular process, it invites the descent of a piece of intestine. (Congenital hernia, p. 310.) If the funicular process be closed at its abdominal end but open below, a collection of serum in the tunica vaginalis will distend the

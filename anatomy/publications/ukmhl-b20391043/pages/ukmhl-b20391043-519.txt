Choparfs AnipiLtation 507 Bones of foot and synovial membranes.—The astragralus articulates with the os calcis in two places, the interosseous ligament intervening between the facets. Its head fits into the fossa at the back of the scaphoid. The posterior of its two calcanean facets has a Synovial membranes of ankle-joint and foot. (Quain.) synovial membrane of its own, but the membrane which lubricates the anterior Hnes also the upper surface of the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, and follows the head of the astragalus into the astragalo- scaphoid joint. ExcisioJi of the astragalus may be required in the case of caries, in intractable dislocation of the foot, and in infantile paralysis and invete- rate talipes equino-varus (Lund), with the view of keeping the sole flat upon the ground. It is easily accomplished by a free incision across the front of the ankle-joint, the anterior tibial vessels and nerve, and as many of the neighbouring tendons as convenient, being placed aside. The anterior and lateral ligaments of the ankle-joint and the astragalo-scaphoid connection being severed, the bone is ' dug out,' the interosseous astragalo-calcanean ligament having been divided. Chopart's amputation.—Much of the movement which apparently takes place at the ankle-joint actually occurs between the astragalus and scaphoid, on the inner side, and the os calcis and cuboid on the outer side of the foot. These articulations constitute the tra?isve7^sc or mid-tarsal joint; the partial removal of the foot, known as Chopart's amputation, is effected through it. In this amputation the flap is first shaped out in the sole, the limits of the flap being the borders of the sole laterally, and the roots of the toes in front. Thus all the soft parts are raised in a thick flap to cover the naked ends of the

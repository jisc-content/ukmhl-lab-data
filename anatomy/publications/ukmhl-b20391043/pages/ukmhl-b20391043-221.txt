spinal Caries 209 with stiffness of the region affected. In trying to stoop the patient cannot bend his neck or back, and he stands with his hands on his thighs or resting against a table or chair. If the advance of the angular curvature be slow, the cord adapts itself, and no pressure-effects are manifested. But if it come on rapidly, or, coming on slowly, be extreme, motor paralysis results, because of a projection taking place at the back of the bodies into the vertebral canal, and impinging against the front, the motor area, of the cord (p. 215). But, although a child may have complete muscular paralysis in his lower extremities for many months, he may at last completely recover movement ; the explanation being that much of the pressure has been of the nature of inflammatory deposits, rather than of the bony pro- jection. In the paraplegic child with angular curvature there is no pressure upon the posterior aspect of the cord, so there is no loss of sensation, and, the skin being well supplied, there is no special likeli- hood of the occurrence of bed-sores, as obtains after fracture of the spine. With pressure upon the front of the cord, the knee and ankle reflexes are exaggerated because the cerebral influence can no longer descend to control them (p. 220). But if the pressure be upon the lumbar enlargement, as may happen in caries of the lowest dorsal vertebrae, there may be so much disturbance within the cord that the afferent influence can no longer awaken the motor impulse, in which case the knee-jerk and ankle clonus may be lost. In the progress of caries, inflammatory thickenings press upon the spinal nerves, causing characteristic peripheral pains in the area of their distribution.

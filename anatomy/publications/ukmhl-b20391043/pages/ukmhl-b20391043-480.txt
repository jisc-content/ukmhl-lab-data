468 The Hip-Joint thinning and an absorption of these tissues, and so escape through the ischio-rectal fossa, or by the rectum and anus. Occasionally the matter escapes by perforation in the frojit of the capsule^ finding its way into the bursa beneath the psoas, in which case it may become extravasated upwards beneath the psoas and iliacus and so give rise to secondary pelvic abscess and to caries. Often when disease has passed away, the hip-joint is synostosed, the femur being flexed and inverted. The limb can then be brought straight down only by tilting the pelvis forwards and arching the loins (lordosis). The exact amount of the deformity is calculated by correcting the lordosis, by raising the thigh, making the line which connects the anterior iliac spines pass at right angles to the middle line of the body {'â–  sguarijtg the pelvis,^ as it is called), and noting the position which the limb thus assumes. If the ankylosis be in a very faulty position, the limb may be brought straight by dividing femur subcutaneously, below the great trochanter, with a keyhole saw. Rectangular ankylosis following hip disease ; a, lordosis, thigh being brought down ; b, lor- dosis effaced by raising thigh. (Erichsen.) As the joint-disease advances, and ulceration attacks the femur and acetabulum, the child finds that he can get greatest rest and quiet when the flexed knee is steadied over the other thigh, and protected from muscular startings and accidental movements by the other leg and foot, with which he lifts and arranges the damaged member. Thus the thigh becomes persistently flexed and inverted. Dislocation of the femur, in the proper sense of the term, in hip- joint disease never occurs. It sometimes seems to have taken place when examination is made by Bryant's or Nelaton's (p. 447) method,

Back of Forc-anii The extensor communis digitorum lies along the ulnar side of the preceding muscle. Arising from the external condyle and from the fascia investing it, it divides into tendons for the four fingers. These pass in the shallow radial groove, together with the tendon of the extensor indicis, lubricated by the one syno\ ial membrane. As they pass over the metacarpus the three inner tendons are connected with each other by short slips. The tendons spread out and form the posterior ligaments for the metacarpo-phalangeal joints ; at the next joints they divide into three slips, of which the middle one is inserted into the base of the middle phalanx, while the lateral slips pass on to the base of the last phalanx ; in each case they act as posterior liga- ments. XcrvL\ the posterior interosseous. The extensor minimi dig-iti arises like the last muscle, along the ulnar side of which it runs. Its slender tendon occupies a separate compartment beneath the annular ligament, in the groove between the radius and ulna, and is inserted in common with the innermost tendon of the extensor communis. Nej've, the posterior interosseous. The extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the external condyle, between the extensor minimi digiti and anconeus, and passes along the edge of the latter muscle to the posterior border of the ulna, along which it also arises. Its tendon runs in the groove on the inner side of the head of the ulna, behind the styloid process, under the annular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the fifth metacarpal bone. Its iicr-'c'c-siipply is from the posterior interosseous. The anconeus (ay/cco;/, elbow) looks like a piece of the triceps which has been cut off by the external condyle, from the back of which it arises. It is inserted into the adjacent part of the olecranon process, and a little way down the back of the shaft of the ulna. Being in its origin, insertion, and action so like the triceps, it is naturally supplied by the same nerve as the triceps, the musculo-spiral. The muscles of the deep layer at back of fore-arm are directed obliquely downwards and outwards, and intervene between the posterior interosseous vessels and nerve and the back of the inter- osseous membrane. The supinator brevis arises from the outer aspect of the ulna, and surrounds the upper third or more of the radius. The extensor ossis nietacarpi arises from both bones, and the extensor priini i?ttemodii poUicis from the radius only ; these two muscles form a projection at the back of the lower third of the radius as they descend over the radial extensorsof the wrist to the groove on the outer side of the styloid process. The former of them is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone, the latter into that of the first phalanx of the thumb ; between the styloid process and the root of the thumb they cross the radial artery ; serous effusion into their synovial sheath is not of infrequent occurrence. The extensor secimdi arises from the ulna, and so, to reach its insertion at the root of the ungual phalanx, it has to pass very

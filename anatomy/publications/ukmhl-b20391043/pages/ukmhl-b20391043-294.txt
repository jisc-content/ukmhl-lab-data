282 The Back of the Fore-arm obliquely across the back of the wrist, where its tendon occupies a deep and solitary groove on the ulnar side of that for the radial extensors of the wrist. Its oblique tendon, which crosses the radial artery just as it is entering the root of the first interosseous space, is an important and conspicuous landmark. The extensor indicis arises from the ulna ; its tendon passes with the tendons of the extensor com- munis and is inserted with the outermost of them {v. p. 287). All the' muscles of the deep layer are supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve. Epiphyses of ulna. The ulna begms to ossify at about the eighth week of foetal life, and at birth ossification has extended from the shaft through the coronoid and olecranon processes, with the exception of a shallow cap at the top of the olecranon, which is still cartilaginous, and which does not begin to ossify until the tenth year. This unimportant epiphysis joins the shaft at puberty, but the lower end of the bone, which begins to ossify in the fourth year, does not join until manhood. Inflammation of the bursa which is placed between the skin and the olecranon process constitutes ' inineT^s elbow' ; I have seen it greatly enlarged in a bill-poster, as the result of constant friction against the walls and hoardings. Epiphyses of radius. The radius begins to ossify at about the eighth week, and at birth only its ends are cartilaginous. The lower epiphysis begins to ossify in the second year and joins at manhood ; the upper epiphysis ossifies in the fifth year and joins at puberty. Fracture may occur in any part of the fore-arm, but the most common site is at the lower end of the radiusâ€”Colles's fracture. At first view it seems unlikely that the stronger bone should oftenest break, and that the fracture should be through the strongest part of that bone. The explanation is simple : a man is falling and he puts out his hand to break the shock. The hand being in the position of pronation, the

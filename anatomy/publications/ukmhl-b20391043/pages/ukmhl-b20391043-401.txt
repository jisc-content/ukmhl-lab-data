Nerves of Rectum 389 plexus, but important branches come from the fourth sacral nerve. Paralysis of this nerve after injury to the lumbar spine may help to ex- plain the sluggishness of the bowel in such cases. On account of the close association of the nerves of the bladder and rectum, irritability of the latter set may cause constant desire to micturate, whilst opera- tions upon the rectum are apt to give rise to retention of urine. The anus is supplied by branches of the internal pudic nerve. The lymphatics end in the pelvic and lumbar glands ; those from the anus enter the glands arranged along the course of Poupart's liga- ment. Enlargement of the lymphatic glands may be caused by dysen- teric or other non-malignant ulcerations of the rectum ; therefore, when exploring the bowel in a case of ulceration, and feeling enlarged glands against the sacrum, one must not jump to the conclusion that the disease is malignant. In the case of epithelioma of the anus the inguinal glands are first enlarged, and subsequently the pelvic glands. THE UTERUS The uterus is about the size and shape of a small green fig ; the large end is directed upwards and forwards, and the small end looks a, anus ; c/, clitoris ; h, hymen; I, labium; n, nympha ; r, rectum ; 11, uterus ; va, vagina. downwards and backwards, to open into the vagina.

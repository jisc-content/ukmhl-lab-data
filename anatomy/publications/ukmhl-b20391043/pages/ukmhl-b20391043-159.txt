Phrenic Nerve 147 the most important of which are from the second and third for the sterno-mastoid ; the influence of these nerves may render futile section of the spmal accessory (p. 71) nerve in the case of spasmodic con- traction of that muscle. The trapezius also receives branches from the third and fourth, which, like the sterno-mastoid branch, communicate with the spinal accessory. The phrenic comes from the third and fourth, and receives a twig also from the fifth nerve, that is, from the upper part of the brachial plexus. It descends into the chest over the scalenus anticus and the subclavian artery, and behind the vein. It then runs in front of the root of the lung, between the pleura and pericardium, and supplies the diaphragm on its under-surface, giving off pleural and pericardial twigs in its course. The left nerve is the longer, because it is pushed out of its course by the pericardium ; it bears an important relation to the front of the transverse aortic arch, whilst the right nerve descends on the outer side of the innominate artery and the superior cava. Filaments of the right phrenic pass under the coronary and falciform ligament into the substance of the liver; and it is probably through their influence that, in disease of the liver, pain is referred to the point of the right shoulder (p. 339). The phrenic chiefly comes from the fourth cervical nerve, which also gives off" acromial filaments in the supra-clavicular nerves, as already noted. In paralysis of the diaphragm, as after diphtheria, phrenic nerve may be galvanised on dragging the lower end of the sterno-mastoid slightly inwards (so that the rheophore may be placed over the scale- nus anticus, the outer border of which muscle corresponds to the outer border of the sterno-mastoid), the other rheophore being placed over the costal attachment of the diaphragm.

443 Lateral L itJiotoJiiy below the bladder and beneath the side of the prostate, to reach the penis by piercing the triangular ligament. In the operation of lateral lithotomy such a vessel could scarcely escape division when the incision is being made in the prostate. ht the female the pudic artery supplies the labia by its superficial perineal branches ; the artery of the bulb enters the vaginal wall, and the terminal branches, which are very small, supply the clitoris. To mark the position of the internal pudic artery on the surface of the buttock, see p. 374. The internal pudic vein begins as the vein of the corpus caverno- sum and receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, with the exception of the dorsal vein of tlie penis, which runs straight through the triangular ligament into the prostatic plexus, as shown on p. 413. For lateral lithotomy the grooved staff is passed and the stone Lithotomy on curved staff. (Fergusson.) is struck, either by it or by the sound—the former for choice, for then the operator can be certain that the instrument is in the bladder; the patient is still lying supine. The assistant takes the staff, and the patient is then placed in the lithotomy position. The surgeon feels for the course of the pubic and ischial rami and the situation of the bulb—taking his landmarks, gauging the space. He then introduces his left index-finger into the anus, to feel that the staff has not wandered into a false passage ; that the lower bowel is not loaded with faeces, and bulging over the line of incision; that the dilated part of the empty rectum is not in undue danger of being incised ; to learn, perchance, the situation of the stone, and to see that the assistant is holding the staff according to his instructions. Then he

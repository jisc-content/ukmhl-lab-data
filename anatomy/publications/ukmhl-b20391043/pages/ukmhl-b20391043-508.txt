Pott's Fracture 496 be jealously protected in excision of the knee. The tibial epiphyses rarely become detached either by disease or injur>\ The fibula also has three centres, the shaft beginning to ossify soon after the tibia. The lower epiphysis begins to ossify in the second year, as in the tibia. The upper epiphysis begins to ossify in the fourth year, and joins at manhood, as in the tibia. But the lower epiphysis, which was the first to ossify, joins a little earHer. This is the exception to the rule, that the epiphysis which ossifies first joins last. The head of the fibula lies far back beneath the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and is on a level with the tubercle of that bone. Tailors often develop a bursa over the external malleolus. Fracture.â€”From direct violence, as when a wheel passes over them, the two bones may be broken at the same level; but when the fracture is the result of indirect violence, as in a fall, they are likely to break in their weakest parts, the tibia in its lower third, the fibula near its neck. Pott's fracture re- sults from a sudden twist of the foot, the internal malleolus or the lateral ligament giving way, and the fibula breaking a few inches above the ankle- joint. The condition was first described by Pott^ from whose ' Chirurgical Works' the adjoining wood-cuts are adapted. With a violent twist of the foot the lower end of the fibula becomes a lever of the first order : the ful- crum being at the lower tibio-fibular joint, the power the outward thrust against the external malleolus, and the resist- ance telling just where the bone yields. This spot is not the weakest part of the entire bone, for that is in the upper third, and can hardly be influenced by a twist at the ankle.

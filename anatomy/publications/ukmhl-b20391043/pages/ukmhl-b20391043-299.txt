Synovitis of Wrist 287 arches, and, as shown elsewhere (p. 280), the lines of the clefts of the fingers must also be avoided. P.us lying deeply must be reached with the director ; but if an abscess have extended from the palm and along the flexor tendons it may be necessary to slit boldly through the anterior annular ligament. In synovitis of tlie wrist there is a bulging all around the joint, so that the depressions are effaced and the position of the tendons is obscured. There is pain on moving the wrist, and also on pressing the carpus against the radial socket or drawing the articular surfaces asun- der. I have recently had two patients under my care who had at the same time sub-acute inflammation of the wrist-joint and acute effusion into the synovial membrane of the extensor communis digitorum. Doubt- less in these persons there was a gap in the posterior ligament through which the two synovial membranes were continuous. The fore-arm Lister's excision of wrist. and hand were secured in a moulded splint for some months, and the disease completely subsided.

47 Cerebral Convolutions tudinal fissure, and runs a short distance on to the convex surface of the hemisphere between the parietal and occipital lobes. This figure shows the relative position of the sutures of skull and the fissures of brain. (Quain.) Kobes.â€”The frontal lobe reaches back to the fissure of Rolando ; that part of it which rests in the anterior fossa of the skull constitutes its orbital surface. The frontal lobe is marked by two horizontal sulci which map it into superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolu- tions, which, like the sulci, are directed from before backwards. Be- hind these horizontal lobes is a vertical furrow, the trajisverse fro7ital fissure^ or, because it lies in front of the central (Rolando's) fissure, the prcB-central sulcus. The vertical convolution which lies between this transverse frontal sulcus and the fissure of Rolando is the important ascending frontal convolution. The intra-parietal fissure ascends for a while behind the fissure of Rolando and then turns backwards, perhaps to join the parieto- occipital fissure. The convolution between it and the fissure of Ro- lando is the ascending; parietal convolution, and below the fissure of Rolando it becomes continuous with the ascending frontal convolu- tion, the junction between their lower ends forming a thick flap which has to be lifted up in order to expose the island of Reil. Acting thus like a lid, the flap is called the operculum {pperio^ -ertu7n, cover, hide), the convolutions of the island being the gyri operti.

Sj'^/ic's A nipiitation Ll s FR A\'C as the operation is on the right or left side, the tibiaHs posticus and flexor longus digitorum, for these two tendons iust escaped division by the first incision. The front of the foot being depressed, the articular ligaments are. easily divided, and the joint traversed ; and the knife, pass- ing along the upper part of the OS calcis, behind the tibia, reaches and divides the tendon of Achilles and the plantaris. The ends of the tibia and fibula are then sawn off. The posterior tibial artery lies just where the two in- cisions meet, at the spot a little below and behind the tip of the inner malleolus. When the operation is being (lone for disease of a child's ankle, the epiphysis, which re- presents the posterior part of the OS calcis, may be detached. If so, it had better be dissected out, as it is likely to be un- sound p. 508). The vitality of the tlap depends on the calcanean branches of the posterior tibial, the malleolar of the anterior tibial, and the posterior branches of the peroneal. In Pirog-off's modification of Syme's amputation, most of that part of the os calcis which is behind the astragalus is cut off and turned up, so that its sawn surface may become ossified on to the sawn surface of the tibia. The incision in the sole, therefore, may be sloped a trifle forwards, the plantar muscles, vessels, nerves, and tendons being cut right through to the bones. The heel-flap, of course, is not dissected up, but the back of the os calcis is sawn off" after the ankle- joint has been opened from the front. To ensure rest and perfect ap- position of the sawn surfaces, the tendon of Achilles should be divided. Lines of incisions for amputations. and Walsham.) (After Smi The Foot The plantar fascia is very thick and strong where it is attached to the tuberosities of the os calcis. Coming forwards, it spreads into

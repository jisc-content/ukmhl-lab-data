62 The Cranial Nerves To reach the supra-orbital nerve a horizontal incision is made for about three-quarters of an inch, just above the border of the orbitâ€”the skin, superficial fascia, orbicularis palpebrarum, and occipito-frontalis being traversed. The middle of the incision should be just above the supra-orbital notch, which can be made out by the finger. When instead of a notch there is a complete foramen in the bone the site of the nerve can be ascertained by pressure ; it emerges at the junction of the inner middle thirds of the supra-orbital ridge. When it is suspected that a person is shamming insensibility, steady pressure should be kept up with the finger on the nerve, just over the supra-orbital notch. No impostor could bear this for long, and he may thus be conveniently and promptly tested. The superior maxillary division leaves by the foramen rotundum.

(Holden.) runs across the spheno-maxillary fossa, and, coursing beneath the floor of the orbit, emerges by the infra-orbital foramen under cover of the levator labii superioris. It then spreads out into branches for the nose, lower eyelid, and upper lip. It gives off an orbital branch which divides into a temporal and a malar twig, which pierce the outer wall of the orbit to supply the skin in the temporal and malar regions respectively. Other branches of the trunk are the sensory root to Meckel's ganglion ; the posterior dental^ which forms a loop in the bone and gives off twigs to the lining of the antrum, to the pulp-cavities of the molar teeth, and to the gums. The anterior dental runs down in the front wall of the antrum to supply the incisors, the canine, and the bicuspids.

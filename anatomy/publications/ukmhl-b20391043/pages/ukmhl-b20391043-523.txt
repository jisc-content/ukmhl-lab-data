Stiff Great- Toe 511 Gouty inflammation is specially apt to attack the first joint of the great toe : because it is a hard-worked joint, because it is far away from the centre of circulation, and because wearing a boot has caused the toe to be deflected so that the joint is not worked in the natural manner. In certain flat-footed adolescents the first joint of the great toe becomes stiff and painful, or inconveniently flexed : the conditions are called hallux ri^idus and hallux flexus ; the cause is unknown, and the treatment is unsatisfactory.

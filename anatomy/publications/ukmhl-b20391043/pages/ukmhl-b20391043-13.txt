A MANUAL OF ANATOMY PART I THE HEAD AND NECK The platysma myoides is a thin sheet of striated fibres between the two layers of the superficial fascia. It arises from the fasciae of the deltoid and pectoral regions, and is inserted into the body of the lower jaw and with the muscles at the commissure of the lips. Thus its actio7i is to depress the jaw and to draw down the corner of the mouth. Being a muscle of (unhappy) expression, its 7terve-siipply is from (the lower division of) the facial; it also receives twigs from the superficial cervical. Relations.â€”Beneath it are the anterior and external jugular veins, the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and the infra-maxillary nerve ; the deep fasciae ; deltoid, clavicle, pectoralis major ; sterno- mastoid ; masseter ; facial vessels, and buccinator. Passing from the shoulder towards the jaw, the line of the fibres of the muscle is that of the external jugular vein, which is readily seen through the thin muscle. When bleeding from this vein, the surgeon must make his incision at right angles to the course of the vein and across the fibres of the platysma, so that the blood may freely escape through a widely open wound, and not become extravasated beneath the muscle. The Deep Cervical Fascia The deep fascia may be traced from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the ligamentum nuchae as a thin covering to the trapezius ; having reached the anterior border of that muscle, it is slightly reinforced by a layer from beneath it. This thickened layer

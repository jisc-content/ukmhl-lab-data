The nuiscitlo-phremc^ the outer of the terminal divisions, slopes behind the sternal ends of the lower spaces, under cover of the diaphragm (which it sup- plies), and gives off anterior intercostals, like those described above. The inner division, the supe- rior epigastric^ passes through the xiphoid gap in the diaphragm (p. 152) to enter the rectus ab- dominis, in which it descends to anastomose with the deep epigastric of the external iliac. A twig or two from it enter the falciform ligament to anasto- mose with branches of the hepa- tic artery. The interiial inamnia^y veins end in the innominate veins. ]tig-ation of the internal mammary in its continuity may be required when an oblique wound, such as a stab, implicates the trunk behind a costal carti- lage, so that the surgeon cannot secure it at the bleeding spot. It may be reached by making a two-inch incision from the side of the sternum through the middle of one of the higher spaces. The skin, fasciae, and pectoralis major havmg been traversed, the aponeurosis is seen which continues the exter- . Then comes the internal inter-

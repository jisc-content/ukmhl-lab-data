447 PART V THE LOWER EXTREMITY Surface markingrs. â€”The furrow corresponding" to PoiiparPs liga- ment extends from the front of the iliac crest to the pubic spi?ie. From the spine the pubic crest may be traced inwards to the symphysis. From the sub-pubic arch the rami of the pubes and ischium may be followed to the ischial tuberosity. When inquiring if a Jm^Jiiabe inguinal or femoral^ the inner border of the hand should be laid along the line of Poupart's ligament ; if the protrusion be chiefly above the hand it is inguinal, if below, femoral, for a femoral hernia comes up from the saphenous opening. The spine of the pubes is above and to the inner side of a femoral hernia. Below Poupart's ligament is a triangular depression corresponding to Scarpa's triangle, and from its apex, which points downwards and inwards, runs a shallow groove in which the femoral vessels and the sartorius descend. The line of the artery is drawn when the limb is slightly flexed A A B, N61aton's line ; c d, measurement from Bryant's belt-line to top of trochanter ; the line A c should be continued round the body. and everted, from the middle of the interval between the iliac spine and pubic symphysis,, to the inner femoral condyle.

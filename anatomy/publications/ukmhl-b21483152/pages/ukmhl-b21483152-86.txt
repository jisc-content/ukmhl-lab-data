84 Such are the grounds on which a " helkf^ in the ne- cessity lor limiting the number of anatomical schools is founded ; such the premises whence it is inferred that a li- mitation of the number of dissecting rooms " is under all circumstances useful ajid necessary in Scotland, where the proportion of the population dying in hospitals is very small I" No doubt a limitation of the number of dissect- ing rooms in Edinburgh would, under all circumstances, be useful to the professor, but flagrantly unjust to the rest of the profession, and injurious to the interests of science. It should, moreover, be steadily borne in mind, that the document in question confines its views to mere school edu- cation, to the course of study requisite preparatory to un- dergoing an examination. Yet this is the first step only in the career of medicine. A person may possess a very de- <;ent knowledge of the classics, or o\ the elements of ma- thematical science, on quitting the university, but he is then only just beginning to think; to discover how to avail him- self of his powers and acquisitions. Suppose, now, that he sits down quietly, and closes his books; that he never looks into a Greek or Latin author; never solves a problem in geometry, nor troubles his brains about an algebraical cal- culation ;—Will he becorrie an erudite critic, a profound geometrician, or an expert algebraist? Certainly not. Whence, then, do people seem to imagine, that a moderate degree of anatomical knowledge is to serve the professional man during the rest of his life ? That he is to enrich science with important observations and discoveries, instruct himself, and benefit mankind without ever taking a scalpel in hand, after once quitting the seminary of his youth ? No one ever excelled as a skilful botanist by simply con- sulting books and plates ; but by resorting to nature,—by ocular inspection, and actual handling of the plants which he attempts to study or describe. The most sedulous stu- dent cannot possibly acquire a minute knowledge of ana- tomy during his academical course; it must be subsequently attained if it ever be attained; and until this be the case we cannot arrive at that certainty in medicine which is so

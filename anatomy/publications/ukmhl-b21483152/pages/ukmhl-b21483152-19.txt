Greeks, Ro- mans, Arabians, and the nations of Europe in general, bowed submissively and successively to the will of the great medical autocrat. We have seen, then, how extensively and deeply rooted the prejudice against dissection was prior to the Christian Era; and very naturally so, since it was intimately blended with their religious feelings and hopes. We might sup- pose a priori that the establishment of Christianity would have removed these feelings, since it introduced purer no- tions respecting the doctrines of soul and body, and whilst it elevated and dignified the former, taught that it was of little consequence what became of the latter. In chang- ing their religion, however, men do not always lay aside their previous prejudices, and those commonly entertained against anatomical pursuits were still encouraged, and kept alive by the fathers themselves of the Church, who openly declaimed against the old anatomists, in terms of no very measured or mild description, as the following passage from Tertullian, who died about the close of the second century, will evince : " Herophilus ille, medicus aut lanius, qui sex- centos exsecuit ut naturam scrutaretur."* We regret that the members of our profession should originally be indebted to a holy father for so opprobrious an epithet; it is one which the vulgar have not yet forgotten. That the church of Rome should interdict the practice of anatomy or surgical operations by ecclesiastics may, to many, seem nothing strange. But it did more; for Pope Boniface the 8th went so far as to issue a bullf against the preparation of human skeletons; thus precluding even the regularly edu- cated practitioner from cultivating an acquaintance with • De anima.

14 formed openly in the face of the whole world. At the death of Alexander, Egypt, it is well known, fell to the lot of Ptolemy, the munificent and liberal promoter of science. It was under his enlightened patronage that the Alex- andrian school was founded; a circumstance constitut- ing, beyond doubt, one of the most remarkable events in the history of human civilization. There, a knowledge of the human frame was not simply felt to be necessary, but sought after with zeal and ardour. It was no longer reckoned a crime to dissect the body of man; subjects were plentifully supplied, and so numerous did physicians discover the errors of their predecessors to be, and so great were the advantages reaped, that they even ex- tended their views to the cultivation of morbid anatomy. The institution of post mortem examinations in order to detect the seat of disease, was especially promoted by the Ptolemies, who did not content themselves with simply exhorting physicians to adopt this practice, but likewise encouraged it by their presence, and still more by taking themselves an active part in the operation : " regibm coi- pora mortuorum ad scrutandos morbos insecantibus !"* So anxious were they to promote the advancement of this new branch of medical science, and to remove the common prejudices against anatomical pursuits ! How splendid was the example which these royal dissectors gave to the world ! Yet no sooner did the study of human anatomy cease to enjoy regal patronage, than men became again blind to its utility and alive to their superstitious feelings. The rubicon, however, had been passed; the first step made openly, and the world shown that dissection, so far from being a crime, was an occupation not unworthy even of royal hands. It is impossible to estimate the benefit which must have ac- crued to science and humanity had this practice of the Ptolemies been duly persevered in. Unfortunately, inde- * Plin. lib. 19, cap. 5.

12 with the Greeks and Romans, physic did not arrive at any- thing like the perfection attained in other sciences. And from a similar cause its progress has been retarded to the present hour; even the venerable Hippocrates never dis- sected a human body, and the only information which he possessed as to its structure, was derived from two ex- tremely precarious sources; the casual examination of dry bones fortuitously thrown in his way, and the occasional inspection of parts laid open by wounds. We need feel no surprise, then, if the ancients could not distinguish an ar- tery from a vein, or a tendon from a nerve. Neither v/ill it appear astonishing that so many centuries should elapse prior to the discovery of what we now deem one of the most obvious and plain truths in physiology, namely—the circulation of the blood. Alcmaeon,* of Croton, is the first zootomist mentioned by history. Democritus,f the ab- derite, was also a zealous comparative anatomist; and Diodes,:}: of Carysthus, is supposed to be the first author of a work on anatomy. Harvey began to teach publicly his new doctrine in 1619, A.D. Is it not then humiliating to reflect that, for more than two thousand years, a supersti- tious regard for the dead should have so lamentably ob- structed, and should still continue to obstruct the progress of one of the most useful and sublime branches of natural knowledge ? In some countries, human folly even tended to deprive the student of the aid derivable from compara- tive anatomy; for the doctrine of metempsychosis rendered the carcaseof an animal an object of special value and regard.^ Under these circumstances it cannot be matter of astonish- ment that medicine should for ages have presented a mere tissue of subtle and incomprehensible theories on the one hand, and on the other, a system of empirical and supersti- « Flourished, 500—4-50 years B.

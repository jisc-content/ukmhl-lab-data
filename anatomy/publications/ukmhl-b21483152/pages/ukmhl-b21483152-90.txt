88 the public good demanded interference. On many occa- sions, indeed, this is so urgently called for, that nothing but prompt attention to it, can save the living from de- struction. Utility of the dead to the living is the end which is aimed at, and if legislators are permitted to act on this principle in one case, they may be in another. Christia- nity so manifestly discourages a superstitious regard for the dead, that we wonder to behold it conspicuous in our se- nators, more particularly in those of the Upper House. Is it not sufficient for us to know that at death the soul can im- mediately wing its way to the mansions of bliss ?* Must we also be childishly anxious about the fate of the corrup- tible tenement in which it dwelt imprisoned; that frail fabric which has been the cause of so much woe, and mi- sery, and distress to us ? We are not, however, without hope of witnessing the prejudices now prevalent against anatomy, one day vanish. People merely want enlighten- ing as to the real nature of anatomical pursuits; by this means alone can their imaginary fears be dispelled. In order to decide whether the ordinary mode of disposing of the dead, or that made use of by the anatomist, is the pre- ferable, they need simply to be informed, that, in the former case the body is destroyed by putrefaction and vermin, whilst in the latter it is carefully and elegantly preserved as an instructive specimen of Nature's nice and curious workmauvship ! â€¢ Verily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise," was the language of Christ to the penitent thief. " Then (at death) shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return to God who gave it." (Ecclesiastes.)

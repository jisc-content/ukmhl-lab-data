18 the human frame. Considering the unenlightened state of the period in which he lived, there is perhaps nothing very extraordinary in this circumstance, although its occurrence is deeply to be lamented, since nothing in those days so effectually operated on the mass of mankind as measures adopted by the hierarchy. It is manifest, however, that Boniface was influenced by vulgar prejudices, and not by any doctrines of the Christian religion. In fact, his suc- cessors in process of time became more liberal in this re- spect ; letters gradually revived, and Italy became at once the birth place of polite literature and natural science. Mondini dei Luzzi was the first who, after so long and dark a period, again openly prosecuted anatomical re- searches on the human body.* Several of his countrymen soon followed Mondini's example; the consequences of which were such as might naturally be anticipated ; the same repugnant feelings, the same superstitious notions as those prevalent among the Romans, were once more re- vived. Hence, Berengar, who had rendered himself re- markable for the indefatigable zeal with which he studied anatomy, very unmeritedly suffered the imputation of being a vivisector. The vulgar and the ignorant have always dealt largely in illiberal accusations against men of science; and we ought not, therefore, to feel surprise at this asper- sion of Berengar's character; more particularly when we reflect on the influence of the church in those times. Still, ■one cannot but lament that men, whose minds ought to have been infinitely elevated above popular prepossessions and superstitions, should have been the very instruments of fostering and cherishing them. The universal darkness then prevalent may, we are aware, be urged as a strong plea in palliation of their conduct, and it is one, certainly, which cannot be adduced in behalf of the dignitaries of the church who have so lately shown themselves hostile to ana- tomical pursuits. • 1315.

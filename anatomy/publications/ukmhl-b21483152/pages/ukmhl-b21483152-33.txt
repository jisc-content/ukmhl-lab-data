31 Can anything be more oppressive or unjust towards the surgeon ? Acknowledging the indispensable nature both of his vocation, and the means by which his education must be perfected, is it not time that a nation^ which, like ours, lays such arrogant claims to a pre-eminent degree of civili- zation, liberality, and discernment,—a nation that boasts of introducing the principle of common sense into philosophy', should, in the name of that common sense, banish these in- consistencies ? But, having dwelt thus long on the indispensable nature of anatomical pursuits, having pointed out their influence on medical and surgical practice, and the consequent be- nefits which thev confer on society in general; having, moreover, vindicated the character of those who prosecute them, let us turn for a moment our attention to the opera- tion of dissection itself in so far as it regards the dead. That which so many excellent, wise, and enlightened men have practised and approved of, cannot surely partake of any moral or religious turpitude. Ignorance, superstition, and prejudice form a tripartite coalition, against which, in all ages, reason seems to have waged unequal combat. Opinions, once extensively dif- fused, remain as established prejudices long after the causes, whence they originated, have ceased to exist. The aversion to dissection entertained by the ancients sprung very na- turally, as we have already mentioned, from the supersti- tions in which they were educated. This aversion, more- over, was powerfully increased by the idea of criminal pu- nishment becoming subsequently attached to dissection ; and the too ample occasion which was at one time given for impeaching the humanity of those who practised it, tended to confirm and fortify this feeling to the very utmost.* • It appears from a passage in the writings of Faloppia, that even in his time (1361,) criminals were occasionally given up, whilst yet living, to the anatomist, who subsequently dispatched them in his way—that is to say, by means of opium.

81 for a limitation of schools, in order that his own estahiish'^ meiit may always have an adequate supply of materials, he need suffer no further alarm; the number of his pupils will measure the extent of his exertions; and these, no doubt, he will then redouble. No place, be it remembered, ever rose in anatomical ce- lebrity simply because its schools were limited; but because the teachers possessed superiour merits, and the supply of subjects was plentiful. Will the Scotch anatomist inform us, why London so far outstrips the northern metropolis in this respect, and why Dublin excels them both ? It is not on account of fewer schools existing in these cities, for the contrary is the case; it is owing, as every student knows, to the greater facility of procuring bodies; and, for this very reason, an increasing number of pupils annually re- sort to Dublin in search of anatomical knowledge. But the Scotch memorial proceeds to state that, from eight hundred to nine hundred medical students visit Edin- burgh, yearly, in order to receive their medical education j and hence without direct permission for the transfer of bodies (which most indubitbaly ought to be granted) a suffi- cient supply of subjects could not be obtained under the provisions of Mr. Warburton's bill. It would, however, savour too much of rodomontade to advance that all these pupils actually dissected, or wished to dissect at Edinburgh. Of the students who graduate in this place (say from one hundred to one hundred and twenty yearly) numbers obtain their anatomical information in the Irish University, and of those who do not graduate, the majority do not prosecute the study of anatomy in Edinburgh. It may be replied that this arises from the scarcity and high price of subjects. But if the prejudices of the Scotch will not suffer them to allow their precious carcases to be dissected, and if the demand for subjects is to be satisfied by transportation from distant places, dissection will always continue more expensive antl difficult at Edinburgh than elsewhere; a circumstance which will infallibly diminish the number of dissectors there,

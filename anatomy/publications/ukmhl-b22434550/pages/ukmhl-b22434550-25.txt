OF Tllli HUMAN BODY. 25 liony part of Human Teeth. Phosphate of lime ..... hi“95 Fluate of lime ..... 2-10 Carbonate of lime ..... 5'50 Phosphate of Magnesia .... 1.05 Soda, with a little muriate of soda . . 1.40 Gelatin, water, &c. .... 28'00 100- Enamel of Human Teeth. Phosphate of lime ..... 85*3 Fluate of lime ..... 3*2 Carbonate of lime ..... 8 0 Phosphate of lime .... 1*5 Soda, animal and water .... 100- In addition to my preceptor, the bones have been analyzed by Mr. Hatchett, Professor Brande, Berzelius, M. Jules Cloquet, M. M. Four- croy and Vauquelin, and Beclard ; but, strange to say, none agree in the same results.* 2. The Muscles. The muscles of animals chiefly consist of fibrin, albumen, gelatin, extractive matter, phosphates of lime, soda, ammonia, carbonate of lime, and sulphate of potass. 3. The Membranous Tissue. Membranes of animals consist of concrete gelatin, and are, like skins, convertible into leather by tanning. 4. The Brain. The brain has long been known to anatomists; but it is only of late years that chemists have paid it any attention. It has been analyzed by Vauquelin, and, according to his examinations, there is no difference ■ of composition in the various portions of the nervous system. Of the analysis of the brain, cerebellum, spinal marrow, and nerves, he gives the same result. He found in them all the same matter, the composi- tion of which is as follows :— Water ...... 80-00 White fatty matter .... 4-53 Red fatty matter . . i . 0-70 Ozmazomef ..... 1*12 Albumen ..... 7-00 Phosphorus ..... Sulphur and Salts, such as q 1-50 Phosphate of Potass . 1 5*15 Lime . . | Magnesia * I am preparing a Course of Demonstrations on the minute Anatomy and Physiology of the Human Skeleton for publication, wherein the investigations of these philosophers will be discussed. t Ozmazome is a peculiar animal principle found in the muscles. It has a brownish yellow colour, with the taste and smell of soap.—Dit. Uhe. I)

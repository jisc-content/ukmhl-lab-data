Several years ago, during my pupillage, when in my eighteenth year, I was requested by a friend to give him an answer in writing to the following important question selected from holy writ:— WHAT IS MAN?* Accordingly, I wrote the principal portion of the following Fami- liarLecture, and, having printed it, it not only met my friend’s approbation, but likewise the heads of several highly respectable families; in fact, it pleased the gay, the thoughtless, and the grave; or, in other words, the public were pleased with it; among whom I may mention, with feelings of no small gratification, several of the learned bishops, dignitaries, and clergy of the Established and Roman Catholic churches, together with many eminent dissenting ministers of different religious persuasions ; as the sentiments ex- pressed in my discourse not only gave the youthful mind some general ideas of the human body, but conveyed them in a language intelligible to the most uneducated individual. Besides, its general tendency proves the wisdom, power, and goodness of Almighty God in the inimitable construction of our own frames. From the above causes I attribute the favourable reviews by Mr. Chambers in the Edinburgh Journal; the late Rev. Dr. Drew in the Imperial Magazine ; J. S. Buckingham, Esq., M. P., in the Athenaeum; Professor Rennie; the Rev. Mr. Wrench, and other eminent characters; consequently, five large editions have been rapidly disposed of. * Job. vii. 17.

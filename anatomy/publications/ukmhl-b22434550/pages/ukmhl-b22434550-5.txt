October 15, 1834. TO SHARON TURNER, Esq., F. A. S. & R. A. S. L., Author of the “History of the Anglo-Saxons,” “The Middle Ages,” “The Modern History of England,” and ” The Sacred History of the World from the Creation to the Deluge.” My Dear Sir, When I consider the great benefits you have conferred upon English Literature by your splendid intellectual acquirements, your arduous researches into the history of our country, and particularly by your last production (which ought to lie perused by every individual), inasmuch as it not only instructs the reader in the nature of those objects which common observation has rendered familiar to him; but leads him to a contemplation of their great Creator, these of themselves would point you out as the fittest person to whom I could inscribe the following Lecture ; but, Avlien I look back upon the kind disinterested favours you have as generously conferred upon me, it then forms an additional reason why I should do so. I indulge in the hope that my humble en- deavours to illustrate, in a familiar manner, the structure of the human body, may be so fortunate as to meet with your kind ap- probation ; and trusting that Almighty God may enable you and your family to enjoy both happiness in this world and that which is to come, is the earnest prayer of Your obliged and humble Servant, II. W. DEWIIURST.

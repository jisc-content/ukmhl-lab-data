VI PREFACE. A sixth having been called for by its friends and former patrons, their wishes are obeyed; and I may observe that the whole Lecture has been re-written, and considerably enlarged in every respect; so that if the former series were allowed to be good, this, I hope, will be considered better, and be found to deserve that kind patronage its predecessors enjoyed. I may observe that this Lecture, in a more extended form, forms the introductory discourse to my popular Course of Lectures illustrative of the anatomical, physiological, chemical, and mecha- nical composition of man and animals; and which series has been delivered at the principal literary, scientific, and mechanics’ institu- tions in London and its environs, and the principal provincial towns. To the clergy of various denominations it is hoped tins discourse will not prove unacceptable; for the pious and learned archbishop Tillotson lamented his ignorance of the subject, when descanting on the wisdom of God, in the creation of the world.* • “ The wisdom of God, in the frame of our bodies, very much appears by a curious con- sideration of the several parts of it; but that requiring a very accurate skill in anatomy, I choose rather wholly to forbear it, than by my unskilfulness to be injurious to the divine wisdom.”—Archbishop Tillotson’s 83d Sermon.

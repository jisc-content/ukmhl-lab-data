The foramen ca^urn is the remains of a tubnlar down-growth formed early in embryonic life, in the region of the dorsum of tlie tongue, from which tlie isthmus of the tliyroid gland is developed (see page 36). The posterior or pharyngeal portion of the dorsum linguae (Eig. 6.39), nearly vertical in direction, forms the greater portion of tlie anterior wall of the oral pharynx (Fig. 641). Its surface is free from evident papillse, Init is thickly studded with rounded projections, each presenting, as a rule, a little pit, visible to the Middle turbinated bone Middle meatus of nose Superior meatus of nose Inferior meatus of nose Sphenoidal sinus Inferior turbinated bone Posterior edge of nasal septum ifice of Eustachian tube rsa pharyngea Part of the pharyngeal tonsil Lateral recess of pharynx Levator cushion Genio-glossus Genio-hyoid Cricoid cartilage Lymjihoid follifle Hvoid bone Fig. 639.â€”Sagittal Section through Mouth, Tongue, Larynx, Pharynx, and Nasal Cavity. The section was slightly oblique, ami the posterior edge of the nasal septum has been preserved. The specimen is viewed slightly from below, hence the apparently low position of the inferior turbinated bone. naked eye, at its centre ; the great majority of these are lymphoid follicles (folliculi tonsillares linguales, Fig. 644, C) similar to those found in the tonsils; some few are said to be mucous glands; all are covered by a smooth mucous membrane, and they combine to give to this region a characteristic nodular appearance. The tmicous membrane of this portion of the tongue is separated from the muscular substance by a submucous layer in which the lymphoid follicles and the mucous glands lie embedded (Fig. 639). At the sides it is continuous with that covering the tonsils and the side wall of the pharynx; whilst behind it is reflected on to the front of the epiglottis, forming in the middle line a

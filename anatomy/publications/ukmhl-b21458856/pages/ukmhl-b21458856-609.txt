G.O (C.2), Great occipital ; C.3, Least occipital; T.l, et seq., Posterior piiniary divisions of thoracic nerves ; L.l, et seq., Posterior primary divisions of first three lumbar nerves ; S.l, et seq., Posterior primary divisions of sacral nerves; Acr, Acromial branches from cervical plexus ; T.2-12, Lateral branches of thoracic nerves ; Giro, Cutaneous branches of circumflex nerve ; L.l, Iliac branch of ilio-hypogastric nerve ; E.C, External cutaneous nerve ; S.Sc, Small sciatic nerve. On the other side a schematic representation is given of the areas supplied by the above nerves, the numerals ■ indicating the spinal origin of the branches of distribution to each area.

758 THE VASCULAE SYSTEM. The right common carotid artery, as akeady stated, differs as regards origin from the left commou carotid. In length and general position it corresponds with the cervical portion of the left common carotid, and its relations also are very similar. Such differences as exist may be briefly summarised as follows:—The internal jugular vein on both sides hes external to the artery; on the left side it runs well in front of the carotid artery in the lower part of the neck, whilst on the right side the vein is separated fropi the outer surface of the artery at its lower end by a well-marked interval in which the vagus nerve appears. The thoracic duct does not come into relation with the risjht common carotid, and there is also a Anterior superficial temporal artei'y 1 ransversejfacial artery Posterior superficial temporal artery SuiJerficial temporal artery Iii,ternal maxillary jartery Posterior auricular artery Posterior belly of digastric muscle Occiijital artery Internal carotid artery External carotid artei-y Brachial plexus Transverse cervical artery .Subclavian arter .Suprascapular artery ^FiG. 554.—The Carotid and Subclavian Arteries and their Branches. difference in the relations of the recurrent laryngeal nerves to the arteries on the two sides. On the left side the nerve crosses behind the mediastinal part of the left artery, and lies internal to its cervical part, whilst the corresponding nerve on the right side passes behind the lower part of the carotid artery in the neck to reach its inner side. THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. Tlie external carotid artery (a. carotis externa. Fig. 555) is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the common carotid ; its length is about two and a half inches

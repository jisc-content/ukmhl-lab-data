The ductules of each glaud unite to form a single duct (ductus excretorius), which pierces the bulb of the corpus spongiosum, and, after a relatively long course, ends by opening into the spongy portion of the urethra l^y a minute aperture. The secreting acini are lined by columnar epithelium. The glands receive their arterial supply from the artery to the bulb. Ill old age these glands may be difficult or impossible to find. THE MALE URETHRA. The urethra in the male is a channel of about eight inches in length leading from the bladder to the external urethral orifice at the extremity of the glans penis. The canal serves not only for the passage of urine, but it also affords an exit for the seminal products which enter by the common ejaculatory ducts, and for the secretion of the prostatic and Cowper's glands. In addition, numerous minute glands (giandulse urethrales) pour their secretion into the urethra. The first part of the urethra lies within the pelvic cavity, and has an almost Pin. 766.â€”Mesial Section throuoh the Male Pelvis, opening up tlie wliok- leiigtli of the uretlira.

Turning more forwards, the urethra passes below the pubic arch, and pierces the fibrous layers which form the pelvic wall in this region. Leaving tlie pelvic cavity, the canal enters the bull) of the corpus spongiosum, where the latter is attached to the triangular ligament, and throughout the rest of its course it lies surrounded by the erectile tissue of the corpus spongiosum and glans penis. The part of the urethra which lies embedded in

857 THE POETAL SYSTEM OF VEINS. with the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein, which passes to the Hver. These veins, together with their tributaries, constitute the portal system. All the vessels of this system are devoid of valves. The portal vein (vena portte) is a wide venous channel, about three inches long, which conveys blood from the stomach, from the whole of the intestine, except the terminal portion of the rectum, and from the spleen and pancreas to the hver. Unlike other veins, it ends hke an artery by breaking up into branches, which ultimately terminate in capillaries in the substance of the hver; from these portal capillaries the hepatic veins (p. 848), which also receive the blood conveyed Fig. 591.â€”The Portal Vein and its Tributaries. to the hver by the hepatic artery, arise; and as these open into the inferior ^'ena cava, the portal blood ultimately reaches the general systemic circulation. The portal vein commences by the union of the superior mesenteric and the splenic veins behind and to the left of the neck of the pancreas, and either in front of the left border of the inferior vena cava, at the level of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, or in front of the upturned extremity of the lower portion of the head of the pancreas. It ascends in front of the inferior vena cava, and behind the neck of the pancreas and the first part of the duodenum, to the lower border of the foramen of Winslow, where it passes forwards, in the right pancreatico- gastric fold of peritoneum, and enters the lower border of the gastro-hepatic

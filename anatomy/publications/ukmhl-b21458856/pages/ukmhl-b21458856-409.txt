THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 369 upper (four to eight) thoracic spines. This muscle is not prolonged into the neck. It conceals the next group of muscles, and forms the innermost column of the erector spinse muscle. The erector spinse muscle is bound down by the vertebral aponeurosis, and is concealed by the more superficial muscles (sterno-mastoid, trapezius, levator Obliquus superior- Rectus capitis posticus major—^-gj Obliquus inferior jj| Sterno-mastoid- COMPLEXUS muscle Trachelo-mastoid Scaleni, medius and posticus Semispinalis colli jj^^p™™^—-Complexus muscle Sterno-mastoid Splenius capitis Levatores costarum Splenius colli Levator anguli scapula Transversalis colli Cervicalis ascendens Complexus muscle longissimus dorsi — Semispinalis dorsi Semispinalis dorsi Middle layer of lumbar fascia Vertebral aponeurosis (cut>- Obliquus internus abdomini Origin of erector spin b Vertebral aponeurosis (cut)- Spinalis dorsi Vertebral aponeurosis (cut) I - Lumbar fascia //gWB Obliquus internus abdominis Obliquus externus abdominis Origin of gluteus maximus Fig. 272.—Deeper Muscles op the Back. scapulee, rhomboids, splenius, serrati postici). It covers the ribs posteriorly, and partially conceals the semispinals and complexus muscles. The complexus muscle (m. semispinalis capitis) closely resembles in position and attachments the trachelo-mastoid. It takes origin from the transverse processes of the upper six thoracic and the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae, internal to the transversalis cervicis and trachelo-mastoid. It has an additional origin also from the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra. It forms a broad muscular sheet which extends upwards in the neck, to be inserted between the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone. The inner 24

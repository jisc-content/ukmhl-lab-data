The iHbital and frontal opocula are late in appearii]^ a&d very taidy in their growth. Indeed, it is only duriiur the eooise of the first year of injEintile life that they come into apposition with e«ch other and with the other two opereola. so as to cl(«e in the fcnepart of the Sylvian fosai and fonn the anreriiH' liml^ of the Sylvian fissure. They do not begin to take shape until more than half of the Sylvian fossa has already been dosed by the fomto-parietal and the tempmal opeacola.

Wtween which ii lies. When strongly devdoped, it separates the two Sylvian limbs from each other to such an extern that they assume the appeaiance of the letter U: wboi the frontal operrulum is less str^Higly marked, the anteriw Sylvnn Hmbs may assume a V form or a Y farm. In the latter case, the orbital ai^l the fronto- parietal <^>«cnla meet helow the frontal <^renliim to form the stem oi the Y. In those cases whexe the frontal operculum is al^ent alt<3geiher, a single anterior limb of the Sylvian fissure is the result. The late appearance, the ^w growth, the variability of these two opeivnla, and also the tendency to ab(Hti\¥ growth or compile suppression of the frontal operrnliun, all bespeak the £ks that, from a phykgenetic point of view, the frontal and cslMtal. opereula are, cranparatively speakii^ re««it |»<oiiiactiotts in the evolimon d the human brain. In the anthropoid ape they axe abeait, and, cai£equenily, the ibrepart oi the i^and of Beil is exposed on the snr&ce of the siiwian Isain. The same cii»iditi<» is not at all an uncommon occnrrraKe in the brain of the microcephali'C idiot. Hssure of Rolando ^sulcus centralis).—The fissure of Bolando takes an oblique coarse acroes the outer CMiTex surface of the cerebral henusphere and intervenes between the finontal and parietal lobes. Its upper «id cuts the supero-mesial IxHtler of the hemisphere a short distance / ^^^^ . behind the mid-point between the firontal * - ■A and occipital p:»Ie?. whilst its lower end terminates at-jve the midiJle of the pos- terior horizontal limb of the fissure of .lainiackiE^ Svlvius^ Its supcrior extremity, as a rule, turns round the supero-meaal border of the hemisphere, and is then continued backwards for a short distance on the n.esiil surface. Although, in its general oirection, the fissure is oblique, it is very far trom being straight. It takes a anuons c-ouise acPDSs the hemisf-here and makes two t-ends, which are usually fairly conspicuous, and which are termed the genua.

The angle which the genial direction of the fissure of Eolando makes with the mesial plane is tem^ the 'RniaTuWr. aagiiR. In the adult brain the average Bolandic angle is 71' 7', and the limits of variation would appear to be 69' and 74'. Fi

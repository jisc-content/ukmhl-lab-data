99G THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM. The pelvic cavity is bounded ill front and at the sides by the portions of the in- nominate bones below the level of the iliopectiiieal lines. These bony walls arc partly clothed, in front and laterally, by the obturator internus muscles, and internal to these by the parietal portion of the pelvic fascia, as low down as the white line. The posterior SCALE IN INCHES SCALE IN CENTIMETRES Fig. 671.—The Fuont of the Body, showing the subdivisions of the abdominal cavity and the position ot the chief viscera. (From a photograph of the body represented in tlie preceding figure.) The viscera in Fig. 670 have been traced in red on tliis figure. The photographs for these two figures and for Fig. 675 were taken ft-om the same body, under precisely similar conditions ; consequently the relations of the deeper parts to tlie surface are correctly obtained by superimposing the pictures as in this illustration. Tlie liver occupies a slightly lower position than u.sual. wall is formed by the front of the sacrum, covered on each side by the pyriformis muscle. This wall (as represented by the pyriformis muscles) meets the lateral wall at the anterior border of the great sciatic foramen ; through this foramen the pyriformis passes out, thus closing up what would otherwise be a large aperture in the ])arietes of the cavity. The floor is composed of the two pairs of muscles which form the pelvic diaphragm, namely, the levatores ani and coccygei—covered by the visceral layer of the

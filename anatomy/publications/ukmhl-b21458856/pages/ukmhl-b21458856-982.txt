942 THE RESriRATOEY SYSTEM. When tlie ramification of tlie cntodermal tnbes into the lung mesoderm is complete, the small terminal flask-shaped extremities of the various branches represent the infundibula. At first these are devoid of air-cells, but between the sixth montli and the termination of gestation the alveolar diverticula make their appearance on the alveolar ducts and on the infundibula. It is thus seen that the epithelial lining of the entire system of bronchial tubes, infundibula and alveoli, is originally derived from the entodermal lining of the fore- gut. The other constituents which enter into the constitution of the lungs and bronchi are derived from the mesoblast. The rudiments of the lungs grow backwards on either side of the oesophagus into the fissure-like jjortion of the cocloni which occupies the thoracic region. They push before them the epithelial lining of the latter, and thus acquire their covering of visceral pleura. By the development of the diaphragm and the pericardium tlie pleural jjortions of the coeloni become cut oft'from the peritoneal cavity and from eaeii other. (_)ur knowledge of the development of the lungs has been greatly extended by the writings of Professor His and Professor Arthur Robinson.

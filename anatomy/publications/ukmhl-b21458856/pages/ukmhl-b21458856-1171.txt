THE UTEEUS. 1131 ligament, which is largely composed of uiistriped muscle fibres continuous with those of the uterus, is enclosed in a slight fold derived from the posterior layer of the broad ligament. .The ligament of the ovarj^ represents tlie upper portion of the gnbernacnluni which appears in the emliryo. The round ligament of the uterus (ligamentum teres uteri) is a narrow flat l)and attached to the uterus just in front'of and a little l)elow the opening of the Fallopian tube. Near the uterus it contains numerous smooth muscle fibres, which are continuous with those of the uterus; further on it is chiefly composed of fibrous connective tissue. Lying in the anterior part of the broad ligament, it reaches the pelvic wall, and is then directed forwards and slightly upwards to cross the obliterated hypogastric artery and the pelvic ])rim. After it has reached the Fio. 77.5.—Mesial Section of the Pelvis in an Adult Fe;,l\le. The cavity of the uterus is indicated diagranimatically. From a specimen in the Anatonncal Department, Trinity College, Dublin. pelvic wall its course is comparable to that of■ the vas deferens in the male (Fig. 773), and, like the latter, it leaves the abdomen to traverse the inguinal canal. It finally ends in the subcutaneous tissue and skin of the la))ium majus. Its terminal part is composed of connective tissue only. In some cases a small diverticulum of the peritoneal cavity can lie traced accompanying the round ligament through the abdominal wall. This is called the canal of Nuck (processus vaginalis peritonei), and corresjionds to the jirocessus vaginalis of the male (p. 1111). The round ligament of the uterus represents the lower portion of the gubernaculum testis which appears in the male embryo (see p. 1112).

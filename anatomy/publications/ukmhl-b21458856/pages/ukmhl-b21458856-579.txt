BASAL GANGLIA OF THE CEEEBEAL HEMISPHEEE. 539 darker in colour than the globus pallidus, and in this respect resembles the caudate nucleus. It is ^ traversed by tine radiating bundles of fibres, which enter it from the external medul- lary lamina. Both in point of struc- ture and in mode of development it is closely associ- ated with the caudate nucleus, and it is the only part of the len- ticular nucleus which is con- nected by inter- vening bands of gray matter with the caudate nuc- leus. The antero- posterior length, as well as the vertical depth of the putamen, is much greater than Great longi tudinal lissure Corpus callosuu Lateral ventricle.

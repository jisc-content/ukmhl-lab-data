OSTEOLOGY. 170 may be deflected to one or other side. They communicate with the nose through a passage called the infundibulum, which opens inferiorly into the fore part of the middle meatus. The fact should not l)e overlooked that the air spaces within the temporal bone, viz. the tym])anic cavity and the mastoid air cells, are brought into com- munication with the naso-pharynx tlirough the Eustachian tubes. For further details regarding the air-sinuses and the mode of their growth, consult the descrip- tion of the individual bones. Coronal Sections. The relations of many parts of the cranium are well displayed in a series of coronal sections. By sawing off a thin slice from the front of the lower part of the frontal bone above, and caiTying the section downwards through the inner wall of the orbit and Fig. 120.- -Part of the Fkontal.

Anterior nasal spine. the nasal process of the superior maxilla, into the anterior nares below, a number of im- portant relations are revealed (see Fig. 120). In the frontal region the extent and arrangement of the frontal sinuses are displayed. The partition between the two sinuses, be it noted, is usually complete and central in position, though it may occasionally be

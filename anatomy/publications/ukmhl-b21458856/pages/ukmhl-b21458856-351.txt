These variable slips of muscle are supplied ])y th.e internal anterior thoracic nerve, the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or the ihtercosto- humeral. \ The pectoralis minor is a narrow, flat, triangular muscle.

Directed obliquely outwards and upwards, it is inserted into the front of the extremity of the coracoid process, and usually also into the conjoint origin of the biceps and coraco- brachialis. It is wholly concealed by the pectoralis major, except when the arm is raised, when the outer border of the muscle becomes superficial. It enters into the formation of the front wall of the axilla, and gives attachment along its upper

564 THE NEEVOUS SYSTEM. sheaths from the pia mater. These blend with the connective-tissue sheaths of the nerves. The ligamentum denticulatum is a strong fibrous band which stretches out like a wing from the pia mater on either side of the spinal cord, so as to connect the pia mater with the dura mater. The pial or inner attachment of the ligament extends in a continvious line between the anterior and posterior nerve-roots, from the level of the foramen magnum above to the level of the first lumbar vertebra below. Its outer margin is serrated or denticulated, and for the most part free. From twenty to twenty-two denticulations may be recognised. They occur in the intervals Ijetween the spinal nerves, and pushing the arachnoid before them, they are attached l)y their pointed ends to the inner surface of the dura mater. The ligamenta denticulata partially subdivide the wide subarachnoid space in the spinal canal into an anterior and a posterior compartment. The anterior nerve-roots traverse the anterior compartment, whilst the posterior nerve-roots traverse the posterior compartment. Further, the posterior compartment is imperfectly sub- divided into a right and a left lateral part l)y the septum posticum. By means of the ligamenta denticulata the spinal cord is suspended in the middle of the tube of dura mater. Â«

374 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. mastoid the fascia helps to form tlie carotid sheath, which is completed hy septal processes stretching inwaxds across the neck in relation to the infrahyoid muscles, trachea, oesophagus and pharynx, and the prevertebral muscles. Tlie trachea, oesophagus, and pharynx, are likewise encapsuled in cervical fascia, a septal layer passing across the middle line of the neck between the trachea and ceso- phagus. Lastly, a strong prevertebral fascia passes across the neck in front of the prevertebral muscles, and behind the oesophagus and pharynx. The cervical fascia is attached above to the bones of the skull: super- ficially to the superior 30 curved line of the occi- pital bone, the mastoid 33 process, the zygoma (over 34. the parotid gland) and 35 the lower border of the 36 mandible; more deeply ^" to the styloid and vaginal processes of the temporal bone, the great 41 wing of the sphenoid and - 42 the basilar process. This deeper attachment is be- FiG. 274.—Transverse Section in the Cervical Region (between the ^^^.^^ parotid gland and pharynx, and is associated with the for- mation of three liga- ments : stylo - mandibular ligament, internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and pterygo-spinous liga- ment. The fascia is at- tached below, through its muscular connexions, to the sternuui, first rib, clavicle, and scapula. By means of its connexion with the trachea and the common carotid artery it is carried down behind the first rib into the superior mediastinum, and becomes ultimately continuous with the pericardium. By means of its connexion with the suljclavian artery it is carried down to the axilla, as the subclavian sheath, which becomes connected with the costo-coracoid membrane. THE MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. The muscles of the head are divisible into three separate groups with very different relations and uses—viz., superficial muscles, muscles of the orbit, and muscles of mastication. The superficial muscles comprise a large group, including the muscles of the scalp and face and the ]:)latysnia myoides in tlie neck.

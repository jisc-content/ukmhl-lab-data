The hook of the unciform is felt deeply l ieneath the radial side of the hypothenar eminence, and a full finger's breadth l)elow and external to the pisiform. The bases of the first, third, and fifth metacarpals, all of which can be readily identified on the dorsal aspect, furnish a sufficient guide to the line of the carpo- Fio. 813.â€”OF Hand. metacarpal articulations. At the base of the third metacarpal is a tubercle, which can be felt projecting from its dorsal aspect at a point If in. A ertically below the tubercle upon the back of the lower end of the radius. This metacarpal tubercle marks the insertion of the extensor carpi radialis brevior, the favourite site for the development of a "ganglion" which may freqiiently be ruptured by pressing it firmly against the tubercle. Anteriorly, the carpo-metacarpal articulations correspond to the lower border of the anterior annular ligament. The prominences of the knuckles are formed entirely by the heads of the metacarpal bones. Anteriorly, the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations are situated I in. above the level of the wel) of the fingers; posteriorly, the joints may lie felt as a groove immediately aljove the projecting ridge at the base of the first phalanges. A well-marked crease crosses ol)liquely over the anterior aspect of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thuml). To cut into the first interphalangeal

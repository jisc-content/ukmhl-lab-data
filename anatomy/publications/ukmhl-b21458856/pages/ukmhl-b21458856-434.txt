THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 394 a fan-like manner as they descend, to be inserted into the outer surface of the ribs posterior to the angles. They lie under cover of the longissimus dorsi muscle. The infra-costales (subcostales) are slips of muscles found on the inner surface of the lower ribs near their angles. They are in series with the internal inter- costal muscles, but pass over the deep surface of several ribs. The triangularis sterni (m. transversus thoracis) occupies the posterior aspect of the anterior thoracic wall. It arises from the back of the ensiform cartilage and mesosternum as high as the level of the third costal cartilage. From this origin its fibres radiate outwards, the lower ones horizontally, the upper ones obliquely upwards, to be inserted into the costal cartilages of all the true ribs Fig. 289.—The Muscles of the Thoracic Wall. • except the first and seventh. The muscle lies against the pericardium and pleura. It is separated from the chest-wall by the internal mammary vessels and the anterior branches of the intercostal nerves. The muscle is continuous l)elow with the transversalis abdominis. The diaphragm is the great membranous and muscular partition separating the cavities of the thorax and abdomen. It forms a thin lamella arching over the liver, stomach, and spleen, with its convex upper surface in contact with the pericardium, pleura and chest-wall. It possesses a peripheral origin from the sternum, ribs and vertebral column, and an insertion into a central tendon. It arises (1) anteriorly from the posterior surface of the ensiform cartilage by two slender fleshy slips, directed backwards; (2) laterally, from the deep surface of the lower six ribs on each side by fleshy bands which interdigitate with those of the transversalis abdominis; (3) posteriorly, from the lumbar vertebrse, by the crura.

In the dorsal region the discs are thinnest on their anterior aspects in correspondence with the anterior concavity of this section of the spine. Each disc consists of a circumferential portion (annulus fibrosus), formed for Vertebral body Intervertebral disc- Nucleus pulposus flavuiu Fig. 198.—Mesial Section through a Portion of the Lumbar Part of the Spine. ■ the most part of oblique parallel fibres running from one vertebra to the other. Horizontal fibres are also found. The axial or central part of the disc is elastic, soft, and pulpy (nucleus pulposus).^ The upper and lower surfaces of the disc are closely adherent to the adjoining Three slips of the stellate ligament Fig. 199.—Anterior Common Ligament of the Vertebral Column, and the Costo-vertebhal Joints as seen from the Front. epiphyseal plates of the vertebral bodies, and as ossification advances, the distinc- tion between epiphyseal plates and vertebral body disappears.

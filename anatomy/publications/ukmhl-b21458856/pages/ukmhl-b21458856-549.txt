509 THIRD VENTEICLE. gradually subsides as the strand, on its way to end in the corpus mammillare, becomes more and more sunk in the gray matter on the side of the ventricle. The third ventricle communicates with both of the lateral ventricles, and also Middle commissure Tfenia thalami linis lid Choroid plexus ventricle IV. Fig. 378.—Mesial Section through the Corpus Callosum, Diencephalon, etc. Shows the third and fourth ventricles connected by the aqueduct of Sylvius. with the fourth ventricle. The aqueduct of Sylvius, the narrow channel which tunnels the mesencephalon, brings it into communication with the fourth ventricle. The opening of this aqueduct is placed at the posterior part of the floor of the third ventricle, immediately below the posterior commissure.

These apertures are placed at the upper and fore parts of the lateral walls, and lead outwards and slightly upwards between the most prominent parts of the anterior pillars of the fornix and the anterior tubercles of the optic thalami. They are just large enough

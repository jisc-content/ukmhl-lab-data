534 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. side of a much larger strand of fibres iu tlie medullary substauce of the occipital lobe, viz. the optic radiation. On the inner vjall two elongated curved elevations may be observed. The Fig. 396.—Dissection, to sliow the fornix and lateral ventricles ; the body of the corpus callosuni has been turned over to the left. uppermost of these is termed the bulb of the cornu (bulbus cornu posterioris), and is produced by the fibres of the forceps major of the corpus callosum as they curve abruptly backwards from the lower part of the splenium of the corpus callosum into the occipital lobe. Below this is the elevation known as the calcar avis. It varies greatly in size in different brains and is caused by an infolding of the ventricular wall in correspondence with the anterior calcariue fissure on the exterior of the hemisphere. Descending Horn of the Lateral Ventricle (cornu inferius).—The descending horn is the C(jntinuation of the cavity into the temporal lobe. At first directed backwards and outwards, the descending horn suddenly sinks downwards behind the optic thalamus into the temporal lobe, in the centre of which it takes a curved course forwards and inwards to a point about an inch behind the extremity of the temporal pole. In the anole between the diverging posterior and descending horns the ca\dty of the ventricle presents an expansion of a somewhat triangular shape. To tliis, the name of trigonum ventriculi is sometimes given. The roof of the descending horn is formed for the most part by the tapetum of the corpus callosum. At the extremity of the horn the roof presents a bulging into the cavity. This is the amygdaloid tubercle, and it is yjroduced by a super-

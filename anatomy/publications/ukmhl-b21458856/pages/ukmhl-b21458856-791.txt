THE PULMONARY AETERY. 751 pulmonary vein ; hehind it, is the left bronchus; above, the aortic arch, to which it is con- nected by the ligamentum arteriosum, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve; below, it is in relation with the lower left pulmonary vein. After entering the lung it descends, like the right pulmonary artery, behind and on the outer side of the stem bronchus, and between its ventral and' dorsal branches. Branches.—Just before passing through the hilus it gives off a branch to the Pig. 552.—The Pulmonary Arteries and Veins and their Eelations.

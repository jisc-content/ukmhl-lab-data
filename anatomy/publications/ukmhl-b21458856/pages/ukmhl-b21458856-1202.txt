The parallelogram AMDC overlies the Rolandic area, i.e. the ascending frontal and the ascending parietal conA'olutions, se])arated by the fissure of Rolando.

A finger's-breadth l)elow AB is the parallel sulcus, the posterior extremity of which turns upwards tn terminate at R, the point which indicates, therefore, the position of the angular gyrus. The fissure of Rolando may be mapped out upon the scalp by drawing a line downwards and hjrwards for a distance of 3f in. from a point half-an-inch behind

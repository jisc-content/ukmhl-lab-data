MUSCLES OF THE PELVIS. 411 The levator ani arises from (1) the back of the body of the pubis, (2) the parietal pelvic fascia above or along the white line, and (3) the spine of the ischium. Its fibres are directed downwards and backwards, to be inserted into (1) the central point of the perineum, (2) the external sphincter around the anus and the ano- coccygeal raphe behind the anus, and (3) into the sides of the lower sacral and the coccygeal vertebrte. The concave upper surface of the muscle is covered in part by the visceral Saci'o-scialic ligament (cut) Sphincter ani externu.s Fig. 306.- -The Fascial and Muscular Wall op the Pelvis after Riomoval of Part of the Left Innominate Bone. pelvic fascia; in part it is in contact with the rectum behind and the prostate gland or vagina in front. The inferior convex surface of the muscle forms the inner wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. Its posterior edge is overlapped by the ischio-coccygeus; its anterior edge is in contact with the posterior layer of the triangular ligament. The levator ani is divisible into four partsâ€”pubo-rectalis, pubo-coccygeus, ilio- coccygeus, and iUo-sacraHs. The pubo-rectalis (levator prostatfe) is tlie part inserted into the central point of the perineum. The pubo-coccygeus is tlic part inserted into the anus and the ano-coccygeal raphe, and the ilio-coccygeus and ilio-sacralis are represented by the fibres attaclied to the sacrum and coccyx. The first two are best developed ; the last two series of fibres tlie most rudimentary. These several parts of the muscle represent the remains of the flexor caudse of tailed animals.

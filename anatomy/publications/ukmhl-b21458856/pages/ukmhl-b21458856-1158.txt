1118 UKOGENITAL SYSTEM. liehiml the plane of tlie urethra, lies em])e(lde(l among the muscle filires, and is composed of minute, slightly Ijranched tul)ules, lined l)y a columnar epithelium. In the upper portion of the gland the tubules are sliglitly dilated and shorter than in other parts, where they are long and convoluted. The glandular tubules lead into the minute prostatic ducts, which open into the urethral canal as it traverses the prostate. These ducts (ductus prostatici) are numerous—about twenty in all —and open for the most part into a groove on each side of the median elevation (crista iirethralis) in the posterior wall of the urethra (Fig. 767). Vessels and Nerves of the Prostate-—Tlie prostate receives it hlood supply from branches of the hsemorrhoidal and inferior vesical arteries, while tlie large plexus of veins which surrounds it, and into which the veins of the j^enis open, drains into the vesical plexus. In old people the veins of the jjrostatic plexus usually l)ecorae much enlarged. The nerves of the prostate are derived from the hypogastric plexus. COWPER^S GLANDS. Cowper's glands (glandula? bulbo-tirethrales) are a pair of small Ijodies placed in relation to the second, or membranous, part of the urethra. They are each about Fio. 765,—The Bladder and the Stkuctures traversed by the Urethra, seen from the outer side after removal from the l)0(lj'. The bladder has been artificially distended. the size of a pea, and are of a yellowish-brown colour. Situated in the space between the two layers of the triangular ligament, they lie below the level of the apex of the prostate, and above that of the bulb of the corptis spongiosum (Figs. 765 and 767). The gland is made up of a number of closely applied lobes or

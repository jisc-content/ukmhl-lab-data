GENERAL EMBRYOLOGY. 16 half-centrosomes are formed, two male and two female. From the four half-centrosomes two new centrosomes are formed by the union of half a male centrosome witli half a female centrosome. Each of the two centrosomes, therefore, which accompany the first segmentation nucleus contains both male and female elements. Fio. 8. —Fektilisation of the Ovum (Diagrammatic).

Segmentation.—Segmentation is the division of the fertilised ovuin (oosperm) into a number of cells. These cells are afterwards arranged in layers—the germinal layers or layers of the blastoderm ; ultimately they are differentiated into the tissue elements of the body. p p A B Fig. 9.—Segmentation of the Fertilised Ovum in the Rahhit. Formation of blastomeres and morula (Diagrammatic). A, Division into two segments ; B, Division into four segments ; C, Morula. P, Polar bodies. The phenomena of segmentation have not been observed in the liuman ovum, and it is to be understood that the following description is based chietiy upon the conditions met with in rodents, more especially in the rabbit, an animal well adapted for the study of these phenomena.

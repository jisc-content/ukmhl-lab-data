The central process passes inwards towards the deep extremity of the bud, where it ends free, either in a single varicose filament or by becoming Iiifurcated or branched. Nerves of Taste.â€”The nerve which sup- plies the taste ljuds over the anterior part of the tongue is probably the chorda tym- pani branch of the facial nerve ; that for the posterior part, the glosso-pharyngeal. The internal laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve supplies the epiglottis, together with a small area of the tongue immedi- ately in front of it. The nerve fibrils, having lost their medvdlary sheath, ramify partly between the gustatoiy cells and ])artly amongst the cells of the luid capsule.

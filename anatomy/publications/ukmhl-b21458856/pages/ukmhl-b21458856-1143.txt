One group of these mucous glands possesses a mniute common duct (ductus paraurethralis), which opens into the urogenital cleft by the side of the urethral orifice.

Striped muscle fibres are also found in connexion with the female urethra, and are especially plentiful in the lower part of the anterior wall of the passage. THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. We have here to describe (1) the testes or essential reproductive glands of the male, together with their (2) coverings and (3) ducts, (4) the prostate, (5) Cowper's glands, (6) the external genital organs, and (7) the male urethra. The reproductive glands of the male, or testes, are a pair of nearly symmetrical oval-shaped bodies situated in the scrotum. The duct of each giaud,^ at first much twisted and intertwined, forms a structure known- as the epididymis, which is applied against the posterior and outer part of the testis. From the epi- didymis the excretory duct or vas deferens passes upwards towards the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall, which it pierces very obliquely, to enter the alxlominal cavity. Here each vas deferens is covered hj peritoneum, and, crossing the pelvic brim, enters the pelvis. The vas now runs on the side wall of the

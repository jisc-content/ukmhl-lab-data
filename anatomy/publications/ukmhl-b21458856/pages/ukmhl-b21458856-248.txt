OSTEOLOGY. 208 bone becomes tbick and rounded, and forms a wide notcb wbicb sweeps forwards and downwards to join tbe mass of bone behind tbe acetabubim, where itjf become* fused with the ischium ; this is called the ilio-sciatic or great sciatic notchancisural ischiadica major). The ilium has two surfaces, an inuer and an outer. The external surface is divided into two parts, viz. a lower acetabular, and an upper gluteal part.

The gluteal surface, broad and expanded, is concavo-convex from behind forward. It is traversed by three rough curved lines, well seen in strongly developed bones, but often faint and indistinct in feebly marked speci- mens. Of these the inferior curved line (linea glutcea inferior) curves backwards from a point immediately above the anterior inferior spine towards the ilio-sciatic notch posteriorly; the bone between this and the ap^fabular margin is marked liy

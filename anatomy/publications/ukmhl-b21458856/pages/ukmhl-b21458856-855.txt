It pierces the femoral sheath aud the cribriform fascia, and passes upwards and inwards between the superficial and deep layers of the superficial fascia of the abdominal wall towards the umbilicus. It supplies the inguinal glands and the integument, and anastomoses with its feUow of the opposite side, with the deep epigastric, and with the superficial circumflex iliac and superficial external pudic arteries. (c) The superficial external pudic artery (a. pudenda externa superficiaUs) also springs from the front of the femoral artery, and, after piercing the femoral sheath and the cribriform fascia, runs upwards and inwards towards the Fig. 574.â€”The Femoral Vessels in SCxVRPa's Triangle. spine of the pubis, where it crosses superficial to the spermatic cord. It suppHes the integument of the lower part of the, abdominal wall, the root of the dorsum of the penis in the male, and the region of the mons Veneris in the female, and it anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, the deep external pudic, the dorsal artery of the penis, and the superficial epigastric arteries. (2) Muscular branches are distributed to the pectineus and the adductor muscles on the inner side, and to the sartorius and the vastus internus on the outer side. (3) The deep external pudic artery (a. pudenda externa profunda) rises from the inner side of the femoral. It runs inwards, across the front of the pectineus, and in front of or behind the adductor lougus, to the inner side of the thigh ; it then

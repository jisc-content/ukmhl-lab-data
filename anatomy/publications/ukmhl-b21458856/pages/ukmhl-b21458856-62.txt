Proainnintic area Bucco- pharyngeal area Notochortlal area Pericardial area Fio. 15.—Surface Areas of the Blastoderm. The anterior part of this second area is situated in front of the neural groove, and as, at a later period, it forms a septum between the primitive mouth and the pharynx, it may be termed the bucco-pharyngeal area. The posterior part of the area forms the floor of the medullary groove, and as the notochord is formed from its entodermal layer we have named it the noto- chordal area. The third area corresponds to the posterior part of the primitive streak. It exa» tends from the base of the tail towards the umbilicus, forming the cloacal mem- brane, which forms the It is eventually perforated posterior boimdary of the primitive alimentary canal, by the genito-urinary and anal apertures. Except in the areas just described, the blastodermic membrane is trilaminar, and at an early period it is possible to distinguish the regions in which the heart and pericardium, the amnion and the placental and non-placental parts of the Embryonic area NG Amniotic area Placental area Chorionic area Placental area Chorionic area Fio. 16.—Sections showing the Different Areas of the Blastodermic Vesicle (Diagrammatic).

These regions form fairly well-defined areas, to the relative positions of whicli reference may now be made. The anterior part of the embryonic area in front of the bucco-pharyngeal area is the region in which the pericardium and heart are developed, and it may therefore be termed the pericardial area. 1'he blastodermic membrane immediately surrounding tlie embryonic area,

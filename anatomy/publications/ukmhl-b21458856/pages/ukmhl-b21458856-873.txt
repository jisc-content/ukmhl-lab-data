833 EXTEKNAL JUGULAE VEIN. Whilst on the surface of the steruo-mastoid muscle it is covered by the super- ficial fascia and platysma muscle, and it lies parallel with, and slightly in front of, the great auricular nerve; after crossing the transverse cervical nerve it reaches the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, where it receives a tributary called the posterior external jugular vein, which commences in the superficial tissues of the upper and back part of the neck, and runs downwards and forwards across the roof of the upper part of the posterior cervical triangle to its termination in the external jugular vein.

There are usually two valves in the lower part of the vein—one, which is generally incompetent, at its termination, and a second at a higher level; this is frequently competent. Tributaries.—In additiou to the posterior auricular vein and the posterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein by which it is formed, the external jugular vein receives the posterior external jugular vein, which has already been described, the transverse cervical and suprascapular veins from the region of the shoulder, and the anterior jugular vein. Occasionally the cephalic vein also opens into it.

385 THE MUSCLES OF THE HYOID BONE. passes upwards and slightly outwards in the neck in front of the trachea and thyroid body, and beneath the omo-hyoid and sterno-hyoid muscles, to be. inserted into the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage. The muscle is marked by an oblique tendinous intersection in the middle of its length. The thyro-hyoid muscle continues the line of the preceding muscle to the hyoid bone. Short and quadrilateral, it arises from the oblique line of the thyroid Fig. 284.â€”The Tdiangles of the Neck (Muscles). cartilage, and passing over the thyro-hyoid membrane beneath the omo-hyoid and sterno-hyoid, it is inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. The levator glandulse thyroidese is an occasional slip stretching between the hyoid bone and tlie isthmus or jiyraniid of the thyroid body. The supra-hyoid muscles comprise the digastric, stylo-hyoid, mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid muscles, and also the genio-hyoglossus and hyoglossus, to be described among the extrinsic muscles of the tongue. The digastric muscle arises by its posterior belly from the digastric groove beneath the mastoid process. It is directed downwards and forwards to end in an intermediate tendon, which is connected by a pulley-like band of cervical fascia to the body of the hyoid bone. The anterior belly of the muscle is directed forwards and upwards to the chin, and is inserted into an oval impression on the lower border of the mandible close to the symphysis. The muscle forms the 25

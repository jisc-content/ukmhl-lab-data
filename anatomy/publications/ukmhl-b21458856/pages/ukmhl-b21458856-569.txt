COEPUS CALLOSUM. 529 is highly arched from before backwards, and presents a convex upper surface and a concave lower surface. The upper surface of the corpus callosum forms the bottom of the great longi- tudinal fissure, and on each side of this it is covered by the callosal gyrus. Only in its posterior part is it touched by the falx cerebri; in front, this process of dura mater falls considerably short of it. The upper surface of the callosum is covered by a thin layer of gray matter continuous at the bottom of the callosal sulcus with the gray cortex on the surface of the hemisphere. In this there are embedded on either side of the mesial plane two delicate longitudinal bands of fibres, called respectively the stria longitudinalis medialis and lateralis. The stria longitudinalis medialis is the more strongly marked of the two, and it is separated from its neigh- bour of the opposite side by a faint mesial furrow. The stria longitudinalis lateralis Gpmi Fig. 392.â€”The Corpus Callosum, exposed from above and the right half dissected, to show tlie course taken by its fibres. is placed further out, under cover of the callosal gyrus. The thin coating of gray matter, with the two strire, represent an aborted convolution, termed the gyrus supracallosus. So thin is the gray coating supplied by this gyrus that the trans- verse direction pursued by the callosal fibres proper can be easily perceived through it. The two extremities of the corpus callosum are much thickened, whilst the intermediate part or body is considerably thinner.- The massive posterior end, which is full and rounded, lies over the mesencephalon and extends backwards as far as the highest point of the cerebellum. It is called the splenium, and it consists of an upper and a lower part. The latter is bent forwards under the upper part, to the inferior surface of which it is closely applied. The anterior end of the corpus callosum is not quite so massive and is folded downwards and backwards on itself. 34

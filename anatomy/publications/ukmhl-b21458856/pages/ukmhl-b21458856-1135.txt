1095 THE BLABBER. fluid after de.atli, wheu the bladder wall has lost the power of contracting. It certainly does not represent a normal condition of the organ in the living. The normal empty bladder is strongly contracted, and its wall is thick and firm. A distinctly Y-shaped appearance is not presented by its cavity in mesial section, l)ut the interior of the organ is seen as a simple narrow interval continuous with the canal of the urethra. Distended Bladder.—As the l)ladder fills with fluid the superior wall is raised upwards from the intero-lateral and basal walls, and, at the same time, the borders separating the suY)erior from the other surfaces of the l)ladder become at first more rounded and then oljliterated. The lateral borders of the l)ladder, becoming in this manner opened out, give rise to so-called lateral surfaces in the Fig. 742.—The Bladder, and the Structures traversed by the Urethra in the Male, viewed from the outer side. The bladder has been artificially distended. distended organ. These surfaces, however, are not sharply marked oif from the infero-lateral surfaces, and are directly continuous with the superior surface. Dur- ing distension, also, the angles present in the empty condition of the organ become rounded as the entire bladder wall becomes more uniformly convex. In mesial section the cavity of the bladder becomes circular or oval in outline, and.the highest part of the bladder, when much distended, lies at some distance above the pelvic brim. The highest part of the distended bladder does not correspond to the attach- ment of the urachus at the apex, but lies liehind this poiilt (Fig. 742). As the superior wall of the l)ladder is raised up it carries with it the peritoneum, and thus the reflexion of that membrane, from the anterior abdominal wall on to the apex of the l)ladder comes to lie one and a half inches, or even higher, above the upper margin

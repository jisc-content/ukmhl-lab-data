NOEMA LATEEALTS OF THE SKULL. 149 niastoidea), much simpler and less serrated than the two previously mentioned. These three sutures just described meet in triradiate fashion at a point called the asterion. Anteriorly the curve of the squamous suture is continued downward between the anterior edge of the squamous part of the temporal and the posterior border of 19 20 21 22 23 Fig. 115.â€”Norma Lateralis. 1.

Coronal suture. the great wing of the sphenoid; inferiorly it lies in plane with the middle of the zygomatic arch. The sutures around the summit of the great wing of the sphenoid are arranged like the letter H placed obliquely, the cross piece of the H corresponding to the spheno-parietal suture. When this is short, and becomes a mere point of contact, the arrangement then resembles the letter X- This region is named the pterion. Curving over the lateral region of the calvaria in a longitudinal direction is the temporal crest (linea temporalis). This is often double. The lower line marks the limit of the attachment of the temporal muscle, whilst the upper ridge defines

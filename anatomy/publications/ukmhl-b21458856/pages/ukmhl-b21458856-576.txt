THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 536 ventricle. It lies on the .surface of the hippocampus major and is continuous behind the posterior part of the optic thalamus, with the choroid plexus in the body of the lateral ventricle. But it must not be supposed that the choroid plexus lies free in the ventricular cavity. It is clothed in the most intimate manner by an epithelial layer, which represents the inner or mesial wall of the descending horn on the Fig. 398.â€”Dissection, to show the fornix and the posterior and descending coruua of the lateral ventricle of the left side. pushed into the cavity by the choroid plexus. The ventricle, therefore, only opens on the surface through the choroid fissure when this thin epithelial layer is torn away by the withdrawal of the choroid plexus. From the above, it will be under- stood that the arcuate choroid fissure, throughout its whole length (viz. from the foramen of Monro to the extremity of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle), is formed by the involution of a portion of the wall of the hemisphere which remains epithelial. In the body of the ventricle this layer is attached, on the one hand, to the sharp lateral margin of the fornix, and on the other to the upper surface of the optic thalamus ; in the descending horn it is attached, in like manner, to the edge of the fimbria or posterior pillar of the fornix, whilst above it joins the roof of this portion of the ventricle along the line of the taenia semicircularis. The eminentia coUateralis shows very great differences in its degree of develop- ment, and it may present two distinct forms, which may be distinguished" from each other as the eminentia coUateralis posterior and the eminentia collateralis anterior. The posterior collateral emi7ience is a smooth elevation in the floor of the trigonum ventriculi, in the interval which is left between the calcar avis and the hippocampus major as they diverge from each other. In the foetal bVain this is

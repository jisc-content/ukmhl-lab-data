Posteriorly, the first and terminal interphalangeal articu- lations are opposite the distal of the various creases overlying the joints. The most important muscular landmarks upon the front of the forearm are the supinator longus, the flexor carpi radialis and the pronator radii teres. The Fig. 814.â€”Dorsal Aspect ov Hand. supinator longus is thrown into prominence by flexing the semi-prone forearm against resistance. At the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the forearm the pronator radii teres passes beneath the supinator longus; between the two is the radial artery. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis forms a prominent landmark descending along the middle of the anterior aspect nf the forearm towards the ridge of the trapezium ; the tendon of the palmaris longus, when present, is seen to its inner side. At the back of the forearm the intermuscular septum lietween the radial and common extensors corresponds to the upper part of a line extending from the external epicondyle of the liumerus ti) the tubercle on the back of the lower end of the radius. The posterior interosseous nerve, at the point at which it emerges from the substance of the supinator l)revis, will l)e found at the bottom of this septum, 2 in. below the head of the radius; below this point the septum is the best line along which to cut down upon the posterior surface of the radius.

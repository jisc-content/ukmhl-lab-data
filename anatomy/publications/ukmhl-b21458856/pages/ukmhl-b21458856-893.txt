THE DEEP VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTEEMITY. 853 The Deep Veins of the Lower Extremity. All the arteries of the lower limb except the popliteal and femoral trunks are accompanied by two vence comites. They usually lie one on each side of the artery; they are connected with each other by transverse channels which pass in front of or behind the artery, and they are provided With numeroiis valves. The popliteal vein (v. poplitea, Fig. 575) is formed, at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, by the union of the vense comites of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. At its commencement it lies to the inner side of and somewhat Fig. 588.â€”The Femoral Vessels in Scarpa's Triangle. superficial to the pophteal artery, and to the outer side of the internal popHteal nerve. As it ascends through the pophteal space it gradually incHnes towards the outer side of the artery, and in the middle of the space it is directly behind the artery, separating the artery from the internal pophteal nerve, which is still more posterior, whilst at the upper end of the space it is to the outer side of the artery, and still between it and the internal pophteal nerve. It then passes through the adductor magnus muscle and becomes the femoral vein. The popliteal vein, which is provided with two or three bicuspid valves, is closely bound to the artery by a dense fascial sheath. Not uncommonly there are one or more additional sateUite veins which anastomose with the popliteal vein, and in these cases the artery is more or less completely surrounded by venous trunks.

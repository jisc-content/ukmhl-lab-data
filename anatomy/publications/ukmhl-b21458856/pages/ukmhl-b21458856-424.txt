384 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. The omo-hyoid is a double-bellied muscle, arising by its posterior belly from the superior border of the scapula and the suprascapular ligament. It forms a narrow muscular band, directed obliquely forwards and upwards, to end in an intermediate tendon beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle. From this tendon the anterior belly proceeds upwards to its insertion into the body of the hyoid bone. The posterior belly of the muscle separates the posterior triangle into occipital and subclavian parts; the anterior belly crosses the common carotid artery at the level of the cricoid cartilage, and in the anterior triangle forms the boundary Hj'poglossal nerve Vagus nerve Recurrent branch I | Superior cervical ganglion of tlie sympathetic Fig. 283.â€”The Muscles of the Hyoid Bone and Styloid Process, and the Extrinsic Muscles OF the Tongue, with their Nerves. between the muscular and carotid triangles. A process of the deep cervical fascia binds down the tendon and the posterior belly to the scapula and iirst rib. The sterno-hyoid muscle arises from the posterior surface of the presternum, from the back of the first costal cartilage, and from the clavicle. It passes vertically upwards in the neck, internal to the omo-hyoid and in front of the sterno-thyroid muscle, to be inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. Except near its origin the muscle lies superficially in the anterior triangle, alongside the omo-hyoid and in front of the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles, the trachea, and the thyroid body. The sterno-thyroid muscle arises beneath the sterno-hyoid from the back of the presternum and first costal cartilage. Broader than the preceding muscle, it

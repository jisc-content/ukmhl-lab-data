THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 848 Hepatic Veins (vv. hepaticiv, Fig. 587).—These veins convey l)lood which has passed through the hver from the portal veins and from the hepatic artery; they open into that portion of the inferior vena cava which has immediately l)elow the diaphragm, and l)ehind the right lobe of the liver. They, form two groups, an upper consisting of two or three large trunks, and a lower group of smaller veins. The upper group occasionally consists of only two veins, a right and a left; HeiJatic veins liiferioi' phrenic artery Snprareiial .body Inferior vena cava Renal artery Renal vein Rif;lit ovarian vein Ovarian artery Ureter Psoas muscle -Asceniling colon Common iliac vein Connnon iliac artery Middle sacral artei-y Ileuin C;ecnn External iliae arterv External iliac vein -0!;>oiiliagns Inferior jjlirenic artery Suprarenal body Cceliac axis Suprarenal vein Superior mesenteric artery -Renal artery Renal vein Lumbar arteries Ureter Left colic artery -0\ arian artery -Inferior mesenteric artery —-Descending colon - P.soas muscle -Common iliac artery -Sigmoid artery Common iliac vein Superior luemor- rhoidal ai'tery Iliac colon Pelvic colon External iliac artery External iliac vein ~T*'allopian tube Uteri Fu;. .587.—The Infeiuor Vexa Cava and its Tributauies. more frequently there are three vessels, a right, a left, and a middle vein, and in the latter case the middle vein issues from the Spigelian lobe. The veins of the lower group vary in numljer from six or seven to twenty ; they return blood from the right and Spigelian lobes. The hepatic veins commence in the interior of the lobules of the liver as intralobular veins; these issue from the upper and posterior aspects of the lobules, and unite together to form suhlohular veins; and the latter, uniting with one another as they converge towards the posterior surface of the liver, form the larger hepatic veins.

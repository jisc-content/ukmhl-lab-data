THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 90G Occasionally tlie thoracic duct commences and terminates in tlie usual manner, l>ut crosses the vertel)ral column immediately after its origin and ascends on the left side. Not uncommonly there is no distinct receptacnlum chyli, in wliicli case the terminal lympliatic vessels of the abdomen merely unite to form a larger vessel which does not present any obvious dilatation, and from which the thoracic duct is continued. The terminal lymphatic truidc may open into the internal jugular vein previous to its junction with the subc'lavian, instead of into the commencement of the innominate vein. Occasionally tlie thoracic duct is doiible, either on the whole or in part of its extent, and sometimes it Ijreaks up into a plexus of vessels which may reunite into a single trunk in the upper part of the thorax. Both tlie thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct may before terminating divide into l)i-anches which, though sometimes reuniting on each side' into a single trunk, not infrequently open separately into the great veins at the root of the neck. As a rule the thoracic duct joins the commencement of the left innominate vein, but it may end in the internal jugular, vertebral, or subclavian veins of the left side ; wliilst very rarely, it ojiens into the vena azygos major.

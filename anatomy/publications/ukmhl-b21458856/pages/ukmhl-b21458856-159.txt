THE SPHENOID BONE. 119 pituitary body. Behind, this is overhung by a sloping ridge, the dorsum sellc^j," the posterior surface of which is incHned upwards, and is in continuation with the basilar groove of the occipital bone. Anteriorly and externally the angles of this ridge project over the pituitary fossa in the form of prominent tubercles, called the flamular process Fia. 92.—Sphenoid as seen fhom Behind. posterior clinoid processes (processus clinoidei posteriores). In front of the pituitary fossa there is a transverse elevation, the olivary eminence (tuberculum sellse) towards the outer extremities of which, and somewhat behind, there are often- times little spurs of bone, the middle clinoid processes (processus clinoidei medii). Fig. 93.—Sphenoid as seen from the Front. In front of the olivary eminence is the optic groove (sulcus chiasmatis), which passes outwards on either side to become continuous, between the roots of the lesser wings, with the optic foramina. This groove is liable to considerable variations, and apparently does not always serve for the lodgment of the optic chiasma. (Lawrence, " Proc. Soc. Anat." Journ. Anat. and Physiol., vol. xxviii. p. 18.) In front of the optic groove, from which it is often separated by a thin sharp edge, the superior surface continues forwards on the same plane as the upper surfaces of 8c

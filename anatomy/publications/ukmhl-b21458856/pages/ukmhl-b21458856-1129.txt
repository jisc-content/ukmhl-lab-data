When the ureters reach the bladder they are a little more than' two inches apart. They pierce the l)ladder wall very ol)liquely, being embedded within its muscular tissue for nearly three quarters of an inch of their length.

When the l)ladder is empty these openings are placed at about one inch apart but 69

The olfactory nerve (n. olfactorius) consists of several parts; (1) a series of fine THE FIEST OR OLFACTORY NERVE. The Cranial Nerves—conMnued. 633 Number. Name. Function. Superficial Attach- ment to Brain. XI. XII. Spinal acces- sory Hypoglossal (a) Accessory to vagus. Motor to muscles of palate, pharynx, oeso- phagus, stomach and intestines, and respiratory organs ^ inhibitory for lieart. (6) Spinal part: motor to trapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles Motor to muscles of the tongue Medulla oblongata. Spinal cord. Medulla oblongata.

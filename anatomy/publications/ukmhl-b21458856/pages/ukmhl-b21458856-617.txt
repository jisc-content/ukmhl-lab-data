577 THE CEEVICAL PLEXUS. The clavicular branches (rr. supra-claviculares) pass over the middle third of the clavicle, beneath the platysma, and can be traced as low as the nipple. The acromial branches (rr. supra-acromiales) pass over or through the insertion of the trapezius muscle, and over the outer third of the clavicle, to the shoulder, where they supply the skin as far down as the lower third of the deltoid muscle. Deep Branches.—The deep branches of the cervical plexus are naturally separated into an external and an internal set by their relation to the sterno-mastoid ^j'lG. 427.—The Teiangles of the Neck (Nerves). muscle. Beneath the muscle^ the external branches are directed outwards towards the posterior triangle, the internal branches inwards towards the anterior triangle. The external branches consist of muscular and communicating nerves, which for the most part occupy the posterior triangle. The muscular branches are the following: (1) To the sterno-mastoid, from the second cervical nerve. This enters the muscle on its deep surface and communicates with the spinal accessory nerve. (2) To the trapezius, from the third and fourth cervical nerves. These nerves cross the posterior triangle and end in the trapezius, after having communicated with the spinal accessory nerve, in the posterior triangle, and beneath the muscle. (3) To the levator anguli scapulce, from the third and fourth cervical nerves. Two independent branches enter the outer surface of the muscle in the posterior triangle. (4) To the scaleni (medius and posticus), from the third and fourth cervical nerves. The communicating branches, already mentioned, are three in number. They

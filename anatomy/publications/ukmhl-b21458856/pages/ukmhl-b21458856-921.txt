Gradually the orifice of communication is constricted, and ultimately it is transformed into a cleft which opens from the right end of the sinus into the back of the right part of the auricular chamber; the cleft is guarded by two lateral valve-like folds of endocardium, the right and left venous valves, which become continuous above with Internal jugular vein External jugular vein Vertebral artery Subclavian artery Subclavian vein Innominate veins Right pulmonary artery Superior vena cava Vena azygos major Right auricle Right ventricle Hepatic vein Inferior vena cava Intercostal veins —' Obliterated portiqn ot the right cardinal vein Steni formed by fused vitelline veins Renal vein Lumbar vein Common iliac artery External iliac artery Internal iliac artery I— 1st cephalic aortic arch (obliterated) Internal carotid artery nd cephalic aortic arch (obliterated) External carotid 3rd cephalic aortic arch forming part of { internal carotid Vertebral artery 5^—Subclavian artery 4th cephalic aortic arch forming arch of aorta Left superior intercostal vein Ductus arteriosus (part of the fifth aortic arch) Pulmonary artery Vena azygos minor superior Left auricle Left ventricle ' Vena azygos minor inferior —Ductus venosus Dorsal aorta Obliterated left cardinal vein Placenta Allantoic arteries Fig. 602.—Diagram of the Course op the Fcetal Circulation. a transitory downward projection from the roof of the auricle, known as the septum spurium. In the early stages the veins of the two sides opened into the corresponding sections of the sinus venosus, but numerous transformations, which are described in the account of the development of the veins, occur, and finally all the veins, except the left duct of Cuvier, open into the right end of the sinus, which is gradually absorbed into the auricular cavity; the transverse part of the sinus, which becomes a mere appendage of the right end, is transformed into the coronary sinus, which receives the blood from the walls 56

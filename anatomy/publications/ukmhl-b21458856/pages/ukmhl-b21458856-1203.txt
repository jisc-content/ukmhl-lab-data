THE CEANIUM. 1163 the mid-sagittal point M at an angle of 67° to the sagittal line (Hare). This angle may readily be found by Chiene's plan of folding a sheet of paper first to half a right angle and again to a quarter of a right angle (45° + 22-5° = 67'5'"). According to Cunningham, the average angle which the fissure makes with the sagittal line is 70°. The lateral ventricle may be tapped or drained at the commencement of the descending cornu, through the posterior half of the first temporal convolution, by Fig. 793.—Cranio-Cerebral Topography.

For this purpoae the centre of the trephine should be placed a finger's-breadth below tlie middle of CB. Or, secondly, the ventricle may be reached from above, by traversing brain tissue for a depth of 4 to 5 cm. through the superior frontal sulcus, 1;^ in. (two fingers'-breadth) in front of the point K, the instrument being dii'ected downwards and backwards (Kocher).

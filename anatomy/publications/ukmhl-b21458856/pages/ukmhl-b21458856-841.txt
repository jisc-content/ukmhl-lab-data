As it crosses just above the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts, the right hepatic artery gives off a cystic branch. The cystic artery (a. cystica) runs downwards and forwards along the cystic duct to the gall-bladder, where it divides into upjjer and lower branches; the upper passes downwards between the gall-bladder and the under surface of the liver, to both of which it gives offsets; the lower branch is distributed on the under surface of the gall-bladder, between it and the peritoneum. The left hepatic artery (ramus sinister) is longer and narrower than the right. It runs to the left end of the transverse fissure, gives one or two branches to the Spigelian lobe, crosses the Fig. 568.â€”The Suterior Mesenteric Artery and its Branches. longitudinal fissure, and breaks up into branches which terminate in the substance of the left lobe of the liver. 2. The superior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica superior, Figs. 566, 568, and 591) springs from the front of the aorta, about half-an-inch below the origin of the cceliac axis and opposite the first lumbar vertebra. It passes obliquely downwards and forwards, crossing in front of the left renal vein, the lower part of the head of the pancreas, and the third part of the duo- denum; opposite the latter it enters the root of the mesentery, in which it continues to descend, curving obliquely from above downwards and to the right, to 51

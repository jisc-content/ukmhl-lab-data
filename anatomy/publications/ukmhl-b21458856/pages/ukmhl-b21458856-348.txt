(2) Along the outer border muscular shps arise from the lower three or four ribs, interdigitating with the FiG< 231.â€”Superficial Muscles of the Back. origins of the obliquus exteruus abdominis. (3) As tJie iqjj^er harder of the muscle passes horizontally over the lower angle of the scapula, an additional fleshy slip usually takes origin from the bone to join the muscle on its deep surface. Beyond the lower angle of the scapula the latissimus dorsi, greatly narrowed, curves spirally round the teres major muscle, and forms the prominence of the posterior axilla,ry fold. It ends in a ribbon-like tendon, closely adherent at first to the teres major, which is inserted into the fioor of the bicipital groove of the

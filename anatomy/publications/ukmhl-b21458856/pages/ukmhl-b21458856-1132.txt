Laterally the bladder is sup- ported by the levatores aui muscles, and further from the middle line it is in contact on each side with the obturator internus ; it is sepsirated from l)oth of these muscles Ijy a layer of the pelvic fascia. The opening of the urethra, or internal urethral orifice (orificium urethne internum), is placed in or near the part of the l)ladder wall which lies lowest in the pelvic cavity. The term neck, or cervix, of the l)ladder is often applied to this region, as here the liladder appears as if it were suddenly constricted to form the urethra. The portion of the liladder wall lieliind tlie urethral orifice. Fig. 738.â€”Mesial Section of the Male Pelvis. The liladder has been artificially distended.

The corresponding xmrt of the Uadder in the female rests against the anterior wall of the vagina. The term apex, or summit, of the 1)ladder (vertex vesica) is api)lied to the portion which lies nearest to the upper border of the symphysis when the organ is empty, or but slightly filled. The apex rises high above the pubis into the abdominal cavity when the Idadder is distended. Con- nected with the apex of the liladder is a fibrous cord (ligamentum umbilicale medium) which passes upwards, in the middle line, on the posterior, aspect of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. This cord represents the urachus, or portion of the allantois which lies within the body of the developing embryo.

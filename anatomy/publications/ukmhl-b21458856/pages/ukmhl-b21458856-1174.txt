UKOGENITAL SYSTEM. 1134 the third and fourth sacral nerves. In addition to fibres from tlie jjlexus ntero-vaginalis, the uterus receives fiV)res directly from the hypogastric plexus, and also from the vesical plexus. The numerous lymphatic vessels coming from the body of the uterus end for the most part in the lumbar lymphatic glands. Along the course of the round ligament of the uterus there are a few lym])hatic vessels which establish a connexion between the lymphatic network surrounding the uterus and the inguinal lymijhatic glands. The lymphatics from tlie cervix uteri end in the glands placed near the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. THE VAGINA. The vagina is a passage about three inches in length, open at its lower end, and coininunicatiug above with the cavity of the uterus. The passage is directed downwards and forwards, describing a slight curve which is convex back- wards. The axis of the vagina forms with that of tlie uterus an angle which is open Fig. 770.â€”Mksial Section ok the Pelvis in an Adult Female. The cavity of the uterus is indicated diagramniatically.

This angle is usually somewhat greater than a right angle, ljut varies with the condition of the neighbouring viscera (p. 1132). The vagina is wider in its middle part than it is at either end, and normally its anterior and posterior walls are in cotitact. In transverse section the lower part is usually an H-shaped cleft, the middle part a simple transverse slit, while the lumen of the upper portion, into which the cervix uteri projects, is more open. The lower part of the cervix has the appearance of entering the vagina through the upper portion of its anterior wall (Fig. 776). As more of the posterior than of the anterior part of the cervix

1212 SUEFACE AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. THE POPLITEAL SPACE. When the knee is extended the popliteal fascia Ls put upon the stretch, and obliterates the hollow of the popliteal space; Ity flexing the knee the fascia is relaxed, and the fingers may be pressed deeply into the upper or femoral division of the space ; as a rule, the pulsations of the popliteal artery can be felt. Beneath the semitendinosus is the fleshy semimembranosus, which bulges into the space and overlaps the upper part of the popliteal artery. Between the semimemlu'anosus and the inner head of the gastrocnemius is the most important bursa in the popliteal region ; it not infrequently becomes distejided with fluid, and then presents usually a more or less sausage-shaped outline; according to Holden, the bursa communi- cates with the cavity of the knee-joint in one subject out of five. To map out the line of the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve, draw a line from a point a little internal to the upper angle of the space to a point mid- Ghiteus medius Tubercle of iliac crest Anterior superior iliac spine Linea semilunaris Fig. 817.â€”The Thigh and Ghoin. way ])etween the condyles of the femur, and thence down the middle of the space to the level of .the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia. The internal popliteal nerve lies immediately beneath the deep fascia; the artery is separated from the trigone of the femur by a quantity of fat. The popliteal lymphatic glands lie beneath the popliteal fascia, one upon the internal popliteal nerve, the others deeply in the space (Leaf). THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. Between the front of the thigh and the al)domen is the fold of the groin, at the bottom of which Poupart's ligament can be felt as a tense Ijand, stretching from tbe anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis. The anterior superior spine looks directly forwards ; comparati\'e measurements of the lower extremities

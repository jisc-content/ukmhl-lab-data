The blood which enters the right auricle by the inferior vena cava is mixed; it consists partly of purified blood from the placenta, and partly of impure blood returning from the abdomen and lower extremities. The blood from the placenta IS returned to the embryo by the umbilical vein. From the umbilical vein it passes along a channel called the ductus venosus, which terminates in the upper part of the

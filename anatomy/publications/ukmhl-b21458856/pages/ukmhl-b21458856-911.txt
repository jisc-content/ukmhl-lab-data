LYMPHATIC GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE ABDOMEN. 871 from the glands of the lower extremities, as well as some of the efferent vessels from the visceral glands, and a few vessels which x^ass directly to them from the walls of the viscera. (1) The vis- ceral glands in- clude tlie follow- Gastric Glands. •—These lie along the borders of the stomach in the gastro - hepatic (lymphoglandul<e gastricte super- iores), tlie gastro- colic (lympho- glandula3 gastricie inferiores), and the gastro-splenic omenta ; they receive afferent vessels from the walls of the stomach, and they give off" efferent vessels which ter- minate in the cceliac glands. The efferents which issue from the glands along the small curva- ture follow the branches of the coronary artery, those from the glands along the lower part of the great curvature accompany the right gastro- epiploic artery, and the efferents from the glands along the left part of the great cur- vature, running l^y the sides of the gastric branches of the splenic artery, pass back- wards through the gastro-splenic omentum to the hilus of the Fio. 596.—Deef Lymphatic Glands and Vessels of the Thorax and Abdomen (diagrammatic).

The scalenus posticus arises from the posterior tubercles of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical transverse processes, and is inserted into the rough impression on the outer side of the second rib. It, is concealed behind by the levator anguli scapulae, and is in contact anteriorly with the scalenus medius. The rectus capitis anticus major arises from the anterior tubercles of the trans- verse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical verte- brse. It forms a flat triangular muscle, which is directed up- wards, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone behind the pharyngeal spine. It lies on the cervical vertebrse be- hind the carotid vessels and the pharynx, external to the longus colli, and internal at its origin to the scalenus anticus. The rectus capitis anticus minor arises from the anterior arch of the atlas, and Scalenus posticus Fig. 287.—The Prevertebral Muscles of the Neck.

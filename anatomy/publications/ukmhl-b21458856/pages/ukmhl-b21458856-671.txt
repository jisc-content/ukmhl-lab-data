Two different kinds of variations occur in relation to the limb-nerves. (1) Individual variations, in both the extent of origin and in the area of distribution of a given nerve, are not uncommon ; these variations are usually concomitant with compensatory variations in adjacent nerves, and are due to the fibres of a given spinal nerve taking an abnormal course in the trunk of another nerve of distribution and effecting a communication with the proper nerve peripherally. In this way the variations in the origin and distribution of the intercosto-hnmeral nerve may be explained ; and, similarly, the ulnar nerve may have some of its fibres carried as far as the forearm incorporated with the median and transferred to it by a communication between the two nerves in that region. (2) Variations in the limb-plexus, in relation to the vertebral column, are the chief cause of variations in the constitution of the limb-nerves. These variations affect more or less the whole series of nerves in the plexus. The brachial plexus is subject only to very slight variation in joosition and arrangement. It may be reinforced at the upper end Iiy a slender trunk from the fourth cervical nerve, and, more frequently, by an intra-thoracic communication between the second and first thoracic nerves. The presence of one or other of these nerves is an indication of a slight tendency towards a cephalic or caudal shifting of the whole plexus in relation to the spinal cord. It is, however, never sufficient to cause the exclusion to any extent of the nerves normally implicated. The presence of a cervical rib may coincide with little or no change in the relation of the nerves. Indeed, the inclusion of the second thoracic nerve in the plexus may be, as already stated, merely an individual variation, a change in the -path to the limb of the intercosto-hnmeral nerve. Concomitant variations occur among groups of nerves, however, which indicate a certain tendency to variation in the position of the Avhole plexus. At one end, the suprascapular and musculo-cutaneous nerves may arise from the fourth and fifth, fifth alone, or fifth and sixth cervical nerves. At the other end of the plexus, the musculo-spiral may or may not receive a root from the first thoracic nerve, and this addition is rather more likely to occur when the second thoracic nerA'e is implicated in the j^lexus.

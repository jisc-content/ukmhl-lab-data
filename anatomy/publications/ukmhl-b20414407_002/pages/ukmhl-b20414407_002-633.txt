601 AUDITORY OSSICLES. with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. As already mentioned, it forms the innermost layer of the membrana tympani, and is prolonged backwards into the mastoidal antrum and air-cells. It also covers the ossicles and invests the tendons of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles. Auditory Ossicles.—These are termed the malleus, the incus, and the stapes. The malleus presents a head, a neck, a manubrium or handle, and two processes termed respectively, the processus brevis, and the processus gracilis. The head is large and rounded. It is directed upwards, and lies above the level of the membrana tym- pani, close to the roof of the tympanum. On its posterior aspect there is a notch-like articular surface directed backwards for articulation with the body of the incus. The manubrium is embedded in the fibrous layer of the membrana tympani. The processus brevis is a stunted projection which springs from the root of the manubrium. It is directed outwards, and abuts against the membrana tympani immediately below the membrana flaccida. The processus gracilis is a slender spicule of bone which is directed forwards, and enters the Glaserian fissure. It almost invariably breaks in detaching the malleus from the adult skull, but it can be easily preserved in the skull of an infant. The incus is shaped somewhat like a bicuspid tooth in Fig. 322.—Left malleus and incus. (After Helmholtz.) Tendon of tensor tympani. Long process of the incus. Short process of the incus. Processus gracilis of the malleus. The straight line a.b.c. connects the extremities of the two processes of the incus with the extremity of the manubrium of the malleus.

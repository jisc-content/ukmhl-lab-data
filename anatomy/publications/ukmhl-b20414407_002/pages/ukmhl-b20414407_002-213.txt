DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 183 wards, and the convexity inwards. The two crescents of opposite sides are connected across the middle line by a transverse band, which is called the grey commissure. The postero-median fissure cuts through the cord until it reaches the grey commissure. The bottom of the antero-median fissure is separated from it by an intervening strip of white matter which is termed the aiiterior white com^nissure.

It is just visible to the naked eye as a minute speck. This canal tunnels the entire length of the cord, and opens above (after having traversed the lower half of the medulla oblongata) into the fourth ventricle of the brain. The portion of the grey commissure which lies behind the central

LOB us UVUL^. 583 tonsil or amygdala, a rounded lobule, which bounds the vallecula on the inner side of the biventral lobule; (4) the sle7ider lobule (lobulus gracilis), a narrow crescentic strip of cerebellar surface which is situated behind the biventral lobule; (5) the postero-inferior lobule placed behind the slender lobule, and bounding the great horizontal fissure below. These lobules of the hemispheres, with the corresponding portions of the vermis inferior, constitute the lobes on the under aspect of the cerebellum. Fig. 314.—Lower surface of the cerebellum. (From SCHVVALBE.) N. Nodule. U. Uvula. P. Pyramid. Lobus Noduli.—The lobus noduli comprises the nodule and the flocculus with an exceedingly delicate connecting lamina of white matter, termed the inferior 7nedullary velum. The velum cannot be properly seen at present, but it will be exposed at a later stage of the dissection. Lobus Uvulae.—The uvula is a triangular elevation placed between the two tonsils. It is connected across the sulcus valleculge with each tonsil by a low-lying ridge of grey matter scored by a few shallow furrows, and in consequence termed the furrowed bafid. The two tonsils and the uvula form the lobus uvulae.

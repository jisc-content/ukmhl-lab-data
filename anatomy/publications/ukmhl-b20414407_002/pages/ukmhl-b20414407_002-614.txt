The two crescentic lobules on the upper surface of the hemisphere are frequently described together as the quadrate lobule. Lobus Cacuminis.—The folium cacuminis forms the most posterior part of the vermis superior, and it bounds the great horizontal fissure superiorly at the posterior or mar- supial notch. It is a single folium, the surface of which may be smooth or beset with rudimentary secondary folia. It is the connecting link between the two postero-superior lobules of the hemispheres—the three parts constituting the lobus cacuminis. As the folium cacuminis is traced outwards into the postero-superior lobule of the hemisphere, it is found to expand greatly. The result of this is that the postero- superior lobule on each side is an extensive foliated district bounding the hinder part of the great horizontal fissure above. Lobes on the under surface of the Cerebellum.—The connection between the several parts of the vermis inferior and the corresponding districts on the under surface of the two hemispheres, is not nearly so distinct as in the case of the vermis superior and the lobules on the upper surface of the hemispheres. A groove, the sulcus valleculce, intervenes between the vermis inferior and the hemisphere on each side. From behind forwards the following subdivisions of the vermis inferior may be recognised—(i) the tuber valvulse, (2) the pyramid, (3) the uvula, and (4) the nodule. On the under surface of the hemisphere there are five lobules mapped out by intervening fissures. These are— (i) the flocculus, a little lobule lying on the middle peduncle of the cerebellum ; (2) the biventral lobule, which lies imme- diately behind the flocculus, and is partially divided into two parts by a fissure which traverses its surface ; (3) the

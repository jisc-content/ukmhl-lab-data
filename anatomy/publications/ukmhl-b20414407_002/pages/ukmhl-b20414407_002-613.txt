581 LOB us CLIVI. presents the following subdivisions:—(i) the lingula; (2) the central lobe; (3) the culmen monticuli; (4) the clivus monticuli; (5) the folium cacuminis. With the exception of the lingula, each of these is continuous on either side with a corresponding district on the upper surface of the hemisphere, thereby forming a cerebellar lobe. Thus, the central lobe is prolonged outwards in an expansion called the ala ; the culmen constitutes a central connecting piece between the two anterior crescentic lobules of the hemi- spheres ; the clivus stands in the same relation to the posterior crescentic lobules; and the folium cacuminis is the connecting band between the postero-superior lobules of the hemispheres. The Lingula.—The lingula can only be seen when the bottom of the semilunar notch is pushed backwards. It consists of four or five small folia continuous with the grey matter of the vermis superior, and prolonged forwards on the surface of the valve of Vieussens or superior medullary velum in the interval between the superior cerebellar peduncles. Lobus Centralis with its Alse.—The central lobe lies at the bottom of the semilunar notch, and is only seen to a very small extent on the upper surface of the organ. It is a little central mass which is prolonged outwards for a short distance round the semilunar notch in the form of two expansions, termed the alcE. Lobus Culminis.—The culmen montictili constitutes the summit or highest part of the monticulus of the vermis superior. It is prolonged outwards on either side into the corresponding hemisphere as the anterior crescentic lobule. This is the most anterior subdivision on the upper surface of the hemisphere. The two anterior crescentic lobules, with the culmen monticuli, form the lobus culminis cerebelli. Lobus Clivi.—The clivus niojtticuli lies behind the culmen, from which it is separated by a distinct fissure, and it forms the sloping part or descent of the monticulus of the vermis

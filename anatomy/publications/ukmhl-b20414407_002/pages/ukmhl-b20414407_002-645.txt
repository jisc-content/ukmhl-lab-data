613 THE EYEBALL. aqueductus cochleiie, a canal which transmits a small vein to the com- mencement of the internal jugular vein. Within the cavity of the vestibule the following objects may be seen :—the fovea hemispherica for the saccule, the fovea hemi-elliptica for the utricle, the common opening of the posterior and superior semicircular canals, the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, and the internal opening of the aqueductus vestibuli. The latter canal transmits minute veins to the inferior petrosal sinus, and lodges a process of the membranous labyrinth (ductus endolymphaticus). THE EYEBALL. The eyeball is not perfectly spherical; it may be said to be composed of the segments of two spheres. The anterior or corneal segment, forming only about one-sixth of the entire eyeball, possesses a shorter radius than the hinder or sclerotic segment. The anterior clear corneal part of the eyeball forms, therefore, a dome-like bulging or prominence on the front of the globe of the eye. The terms miterior and posterior pole are respectively applied to the central points of the anterior and posterior curvatures of the eyeball. The imaginary line which joins these poles receives the name of the sagittal axis., whilst another line drawn in a coronal direction around the globe of the eye midway between the two poles so as to divide the eyeball into two hemispheres is termed the equator. Imaginary meridional lines are also drawn between the two poles so as to cut the equatorial line at right angles. In studying the structure of the eyeball it is necessary to have a proper understanding of these terms. Dissection of the Eyeball.—A satisfactory dissection of the globe of the eye can only be made when the eyeball is fresh ; and in the dissect- ing-room it is impossible to obtain suitable specimens. This does not in reality matter very much because it is always easy to procure eyeballs of the pig, sheep, or ox, which suit the purpose admirably. It is

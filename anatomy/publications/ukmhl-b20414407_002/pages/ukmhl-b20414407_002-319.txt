DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 289 cases its deficiency is compensated for by an increase in the size of the transverse facial, or of some of the other vessels which appear on the face. The course of the facial artery in the neck has already been noted (p. 256). It enters the face by passing on to the mandible immediately in front of the masseter muscle. It then takes a very tortuous course forwards and upwards to a point a short distance behind the angle of the mouth ; from this it ascends to the inner canthus of the eye, and much reduced in size by the numerous branches it has given off, it terminates by anastomosing with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. Throughout its whole length it is comparatively superficial. It is true that it is placed somewhat deeply in the fat of the cheek, but the only muscles which cover it are, from below upwards : the platysma, the risorius, and the zygomaticus major. Its terminal part is usually embedded in the midst of the fibres of the levator labii superioris ateque nasi. The parts upon which it rests as it extends through the face, will be seen to be—(i) the lower jaw; (2) the buccinator; (3) the levator anguli oris ; (4) the levator labii superioris. The facial vein does not accompany it closely in the face, but lies, above the level of the lower jaw, at some distance behind it. Several branches of the facial nerve cross it. Branches of the Facial Artery.—The branches which arise from the facial artery are very numerous. Some of inconsiderable size pass backwards. They are distributed to parts in the buccal, masseteric and malar regions, and anastomose with the transverse facial, the buccal, and the infra-orbital arteries. Others proceed forwards^ and being of larger size, they receive special designations. They are :—■ 1. Inferior labial. I 3. Superior coronary. 2. Inferior coronary. | 4. Lateral nasal. 5. Angular.

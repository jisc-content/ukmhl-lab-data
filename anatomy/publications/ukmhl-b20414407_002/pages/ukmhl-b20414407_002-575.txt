The anterior pillars of the fornix (columnse fornicis) are two rounded strands which emerge from the anterior part of the body of the fornix, and then diverge very slightly from each other as they curve downwards in front of the foramen of Monro. Sinking into the grey matter on the lateral wall of the third ventricle, each anterior horn proceeds down- wards to the base of the brain, where it protrudes in the ascends from the corpus mammillare are not directly con- tinuous with those of the anterior pillar of the fornix, it receives the special name of the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr. The connections which have just been described cannot be made out at present, but at a later period the dissector will experience little difficulty in tracing the anterior pillar of the fornix to the corpus mam- millare, and in displaying the connection of this with the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr. The posterior pillars of the fornix are flattened bands which diverge widely from the body of the fornix. At first they are adherent to the under surface of the corpus cal- losum, but soon they sweep downwards round the posterior ends of the optic thalami, and enter the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles. Here each posterior pillar comes into relation with the corresponding hippocampus major, and a portion of its fibres become spread out on the surface of Fig. 296.â€”Diagram of the fornix ; profile view. form of the corpus mammillare. This appears to be a twisted loop of the anterior pillar, in which the pillar turns upon itself, and is then continued upwards and backwards into the anterior tubercle of the optic thalamus. As there is good reason to believe that the fibres of the strand which

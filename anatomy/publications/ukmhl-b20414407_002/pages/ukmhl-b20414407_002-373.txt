DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 343 Vagus or Pneumogastric Nerve. — The vagus passes through the middle compartment of the jugular foramen in company with the spinal accessory—both being included within the same sheath of dura mater. In the neck it pur- sues a vertical course, lying, in the first instance, between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, and afterwards between the same vein and the common carotid artery. Further, as has been already observed, it is inclosed within the sheath which envelops these vessels, and it lies upon a plane posterior to them. At the root of the neck it enters the thorax, and shows different relations on the two sides. On the right side it crosses the first part of the subclavian artery; on the left side it proceeds downwards between the common carotid and left subclavian arteries, and passes under cover of the left innominate vein. As in the case of the glosso-pharyngeal, the vagus shows two ganglia in connection with its upper part. These are thQ ganglion of the root {gangliojt superius) and the ganglion of the trunk {ga^tglion inferius or plexus nodosus). The Ganglion of the Root is situated within the jugular foramen. It is a rounded sweUing which is connected by communicating twigs with several of the nerves in the neighbourhood, and which gives off two branches of distribution. Branches of Communication. Branches of Distribution. 1. With the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. 2. With the spinal accessory. 3. With the superior ganglion of the sympathetic. 1. Recurrent nerve. 2. Auricular nerve. The reairrent branch is a minute twig which runs backwards through the jugular foramen, and, dividing into two branches, is distributed to the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa. The auricular nerve (Arnold's nerve) obtains a filament of communi- cation from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal, and proceeds

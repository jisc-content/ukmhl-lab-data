175 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. the anterior root, on the other hand, are not so regularly placed. They emerge from the cord over an area of some breadth. The size of the nerve-roots will be observed to differ greatly. The lower lumbar and upper sacral nerve-roots are much the largest, whilst the lower sacral and the coccygeal roots are the smallest. In the cervical region the roots increase in size from above downwards, but more rapidly in the lower members of the group; in the dorsal region the roots of the first nerve are large, but those which succeed it are small and of uniform size. In relative lengthy and in the direction which they follow in the spinal canal, the nerve-roots also show great differ- ences. This is due to the spinal cord being so much shorter than the canal in which it lies. In the upper part of the cervical region the nerve-roots are short, and proceed out- wards in a more or less horizontal direction. Below this the nerve-roots gradually lengthen, and have to descend in the spinal canal for a distance which is always increasing the farther down we go. The arrangement of the lower dorsal, the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerve-roots, is particularly characteristic. They are exceedingly long, and 7 Fig. 202.â€”Segments of spinal cord ; anterior aspect. (ScHWALBE, after Allen Thomson.) 1. Anterior median fissure. 2. Posterior median fissure. 3 and 5.

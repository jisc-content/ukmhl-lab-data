THE CEREBRUM. the supero-mesial margin above to the posterior horizontal limb of the Sylvian fissure below (Fig. 283, C.A.). The superior frontal sulcus (Fig. 283,/*^), extends forwards in a more or less horizontal direction from the sulcus praecentralis superior. The gyrus frontalis superior (Fig. 283, F^) is the narrow convolution between the supero-mesial border of the hemi- sphere and the superior frontal sulcus. It takes a horizontal course forwards to the frontal pole. The ififerior frontal sulcus (Fig. 283,/"^), occupies a lower level than the superior furrow of the same name. Its hinder end is placed in the angle between the vertical and horizontal parts of the inferior praecentral sulcus, and is not infrequently confluent with one or other of these. It pro- ceeds forwards towards the superciliary margin of the hemi- sphere, and ends a short distance from this in a terminal bifurcation. The gyrus fro?italis medius (Fig. 283, F^) is the broad convolution which lies between the superior and inferior frontal furrows. The gyrus frontalis inferior (Fig. 283, F^) is that portion of the outer surface of the frontal lobe which is placed in front of the inferior praecentral sulcus and below the inferior frontal sulcus. The sulcus paramedians (Fig. 283, pjn.s.), is the term applied to a series of short irregular furrows arranged longitudinally, close to the supero-mesial border of the hemisphere. These rudimentary sulci partially subdivide the superior frontal convolution into an upper and lower division, and are of interest in so far that they are best marked in high types of brain. The sulcus frontalis medius of Eberstaller (Fig. 283, proceeds horizontally forwards in the fore part of the middle frontal convolution, so as to divide it into an upper'and a lower part (Fig. 283, F-S and F-I). When it reaches the supercilary margin of the hemisphere it bifurcates, and its

556 THE BRAIN. pigmented matter which intervenes between them. This is termed the substantia nigra. Substantia Nigra.—As seen in transverse section the sub- stantia nigra presents a somewhat crescentic outHne, and is largely composed of pigmented nerve cells. It is in reality a thick band which begins below at the upper border of the pons Varolii, and extends upwards in the midst of the crus cerebri, as high as the corpora mammillaria. The margins of this band of dark coloured substance come to the surface at the oculomotor and lateral sulci, and its inner part is traversed by the emerging nerve fibres of the oculomotor SULCUS OCULOMOTORIUS Fig. 302.—Diagrammatic view of the cut surface of the mesencephalon when transversely divided. nerve. The surface turned towards the tegmentum is concave and uniform ; the opposite surface is convex, and rendered highly irregular by the presence of numerous slender prolongations of the substance into the crusta. The Crusta.—The crusta is somewhat crescentic when seen in section, and stands quite apart from its fellow of the opposite side. It is composed of a compact mass of longitudinally directed nerve fibres which are carried upwards into the internal capsule. The middle third of each crusta is composed of the important pyrai7iidal tract, but this is

284 HEAD AND NECK. branches of the cervico-facial division in the midst of the parotid gland. This receives the name of the pes anserinus or plexus parotideus. The branches into which this portion of the facial trunk divides are classified according to the direction which they take intoâ€” 1. Temporal. 2. Malar. 3. Infra-orbital. The temporal branches, three or four in number, emerge from the upper border of the parotid, and are carried up- wards over the zygomatic arch to the temporal region. Here they supply the attrahens auriculam, the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis, the orbicularis palpebrarum, and the corrugator supercilii. They communicate with several branches of the trigeminal or fifth cranial nerve, more especially with the auriculo-temporal, the temporal branch of the orbital, and the supra-orbital. The malar branches run forwards upon the malar bone, and end in filaments, which enter the outer and lower part of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. Some of the twigs may be traced to the upper and lower eyeHds. On the malar bone they communicate with the malar branch of the orbital nerve, and in the eyelids they are connected with the various branches of the trigeminal nerve which are distributed to these structures. The infra-orbital branches are larger than either of the preceding, and they run horizontally forwards along the lower border of the malar bone, and under cover of the zygomaticus major to the infra-orbital region. Here they supply twigs to the muscles in this neighbourhood as well as to the muscles of the nose. They likewise communicate with the infra-orbital, nasal, and infra-trochlear nerves. With the infra-orbital nerve they form a complicated plexus (the infra-orbital plexus), under cover of the levator labii superioris.

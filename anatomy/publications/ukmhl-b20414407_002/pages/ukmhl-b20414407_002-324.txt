294 HEAD AND NECK. The following strata will be exposed in each eyelid as the student dissects from the surface towards the conjunctiva lining its deep aspect:— Upper Lid. Lower Lid. 1. Integument. 2. Palpebral part of the orbicu- laris palpebrarum. 3. The tarsus, the palpebral liga- ment, and the expanded ten- don of the levator palpebrae superioris. 4. Conjunctiva. 1. Integument. 2. Palpebral part of the orbicu- laris palpebrarum. 3. The tarsus and the palpebral ligament. 4. Conjunctiva. In addition to these structures, two ligaments named the internal a?id external tarsal ligaments will be noticed. They attach the tarsal plates to the inner and outer margins of the orbit. The dissection should be carried on in both eyelids at the same time. Integument and Orbicularis.—^These strata have already been examined, and the skin has been reflected. The palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle in each lid forms a thin layer of arching muscular fibres loosely connected with the integument by some lax areolar tissue. A fasci- culus, somewhat thicker than the others, lies along the free margin of each lid, close to the bases of the eyelashes. This is termed the musculus ciliaris. Dissection.—The entire orbicularis muscle may now be thrown inwards. This will show very clearly the origin of its muscular fibres at the inner margin of the orbit (p. 271). In raising the palpebral part great care must be taken to preserve the palpebral vessels and nerves, and at the same time to avoid injury to the palpebral ligament. The Tarsi.—The removal of the palpebral part of the orbicularis brings into view the palpebral ligaments and the tarsal plates. These lie in the same morphological plane, and they constitute the ground-work of the eyelids.

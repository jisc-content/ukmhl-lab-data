352 HEAD AND NECK. the superior articular process of the atlas, under cover of the vertebral artery and the rectus capitis lateralis, and, gaining the anterior aspect of the atlas, it enters into the formation of the first loop of the cervical plexus. As it lies in relation to the vertebral artery, it is joined by a filament from the sympathetic plexus which surrounds that vessel. Removal of the Head and Neck from the Trunk.—By the thne that the dissectors of the head and neck have arrived at this stage of their work, the dissectors of the thorax have in all probability finished their dissection. If this be the case, the head and neck may be removed from the trunk by cutting through the vertebral column at the level of "the inter\-ertebral disc between the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae. By this proceeding the three upper dorsal vertebrae, with the attached portions of the first, second, and third pairs of ribs, are removed with the neck. The scalene muscles and the longus colli are therefore pre- served intact. THE LATERAL PART OF THE MIDDLE CRANL\L FOSSA. The structures contained within the middle cranial fossa may now be examined, and, in carrying out this dissection, the head should be supported on a block so that the floor of the cranial cavity looks upwards. The following are the structures which must be displayed :— 1. Cavernous venous sinus. 2. Internal carotid arter}-. 3. Middle meningeal arter}-. 4. Small meningeal arter}-. 5. The two roots of the trigeminal nerve, with the Gasserian ganglion and the three main divisions of the trigeminal nerve. 6. Oculomotor nerve (3rd cranial). 7. Trochlear nerve (4th cranial). 8. Abducent ner\-e (6th cranial). 9. Cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. 10. Great superficial petrosal nerve. 11. Small superficial petrosal nerve.

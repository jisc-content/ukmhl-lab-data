MOUTH AND PHARYNX. 399 more or less destroyed. The muscular layer constitutes the chief bulk of the lips. It is formed by the orbicularis oris and the various muscles which converge upon the mouth. The labial glands are very numerous and lie between the mucous membrane and the muscular fibres. In each lip there is an arterial arch formed by the corresponding coronary arteries (p. 290). The Cheeks have five layers entering into their construc- tion, all of which have been examined in the dissection of the face. They are—(i) skin; (2) a fatty layer traversed by some of the facial muscles and the facial artery; (3) the buccal aponeurosis; (4) the buccinator muscle; (5) the mucous membrane. The buccal glands are numerous and are situated between the buccinator muscle and the buccal aponeurosis. Their ducts pierce the muscle and open upon the inner aspect of the mucous membrane. The buccal aponeurosis is a dense fascia which covers the buccinator muscle. Above and below it is attached to the alveolar portions of the maxillary and mandibular bones, whilst behind it is continued backwards upon the side of the pharynx. The muscles which traverse the fatty layer are chiefly the zygomaticus major, the risorius, and the posterior fibres of the platysma. The parotid duct pierces the three inner layers of the cheek, and opens into the mouth opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. Gums and Teeth.—The mucous membrane of the gums is smooth, vascular, and firmly bound down to the subjacent periosteum of the alveolar portions of the jaws by a stratum of dense connective tissue. It is continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the lips and cheeks, and on the other, with the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. The gum embraces closely the neck of each tooth. In the adult the teeth in each jaw number sixteen. From the middle line backwards, on each side, they are the two^ incisors, the canine, the two bicuspids, the three molars.

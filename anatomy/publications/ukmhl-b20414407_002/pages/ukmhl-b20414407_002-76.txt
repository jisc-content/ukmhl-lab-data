THORAX. 54 It is necessary, however, to note the relative position of these cusps. One, the largest of the three, is suspended so as to intervene between the auriculo-ventricular opening and the pulmonary orifice. It lies in front and to the left of the opening. This is the infundibular cusp. Another is placed posteriorly to the auriculo-ventricular opening, and lies closely applied to the septum. This is the septal cusp.

The third is situated to the right, near the margin of the heart, and may be termed the inarginal cusp. The chordae tendinese of the anterior papillary muscle are distributed in the interval between the infundibular and marginal flaps; those from the posterior papillary muscle go to the interval between the marginal and septal flaps; whilst to the interval

THORAX. 88 believed that the middle lobe of the right lung is the representative of the upper lobe of the left lung. When the main stem of the bronchus is followed into the inferior lobe on either side, it will be observed to travel downwards towards the back part of the base, and give off, as it proceeds, a series of large ventral^ and a series of smaller dorsal branches. The first hyparterial division on each side {i.e.^ the branch to the middle lobe of the right side, and the branch to the upper lobe of the left side) may be regarded as the first member of the ventral group (Fig. 183). It should be observed that when the bronchial tubes enter the lung, they cease to be flattened posteriorly, and become uniformly cylindrical. This is due to the cartilage being disposed around the tube on all its aspects, in the form of irregular flakes, and imperfect rings. The further the tubes are traced, the scarcer and finer become the particles of cartilage. The pulmonary vessels in the substance of the lungs run with the bronchi. The vei?is still keep to the front of the air passages; the arteries., however, as we have noted, turn backwards to reach their posterior aspect, and this relation they maintain in the lung substance. Dissection.—The dissector should next turn his attention to the thoracic portion of the sympathetic nervous system. In order to expose it, he must strip the parietal pleura from the sides of the vertebrae and the inner surface of the ribs. Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic.^—This extends downwards through the thoracic cavity upon the heads of the ribs and the intervening intercostal spaces, and has an appearance somewhat similar to a knotted string. The thoracic ganglia are usually twelve in number, and, with the exception of the two lowest, they are placed upon the heads of the upper ten ribs. Towards the diaphragm the cord inclines forwards, so that the two lowest ganglia come to lie upon the bodies of the two last dorsal vertebra. The first

SIDE OF THE NECK. 249 may be marked on the surface by drawing a line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the lower jaw and the mastoid process. At the root of the neck the two vessels are close together, the trachea and oeso- phagus alone intervening, but as they proceed upwards they diverge slightly from each other, and where they end they are separated by the entire width of the thyroid cartilage and the pharynx. Together with the internal jugular vein, the pneumogastric nerve, and the descendens hypoglossi nerve, the vessel is enveloped by a strongly marked sheath derived from the cervical fascia. This has been removed, but its constitu- tion, and the relation which its contents bear to each other within it, have been already observed (pp. 198, 217). The common carotid artery is very differently circum- stanced in regard to the surface in its lower and upper parts. . Opposite the cricoid cartilage it is crossed by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and below this it is placed very deeply, being covered by the integument, platysma, and deep fascia, and by three muscular strata, viz., the sterno- mastoid, the sterno-hyoid, and the sterno-thyroid. Above the level of the omo-hyoid muscle it lies within the limits of the carotid triangle, and is therefore placed nearer the surface. Here it is merely overlapped by the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and covered by the platysma, fasciae, and integument. The vessels and nerves in relation to its anterior surface are :â€” 1. Superior thyroid vein. 4. Sterno-mastoid artery. 2. Middle thyroid vein. 5. Descendens hypoglossi nerve 3. Anterior jugular vein. and the ansa hypoglossi. The three veins cross the common carotid from within outwards, and at different levels, viz., the superior thyroid near its bifurcation, the middle thyroid below the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the anterior jugular at the root of the neck ; whilst, however, the thyroid veins are in im-

THE LARYNX. 447 the hyoid bone and tongue, whilst inferiorly it is directly continuous with the trachea. In front it is covered by the integument and deep cervical fascia, and on either side of the mesial plane by two thin strata of muscles, viz., the sterno- hyoid, the omo-hyoid, the sterno - thyroid and the thyro-hyoid. As a general rule a narrow process of the thyroid body, termed the central lobe, is also continued upwards on its anterior surface. On each side the lateral lobe of the thyroid body is prolonged upwards upon it, and it is related to the great vessels of the neck. Posteriorly it is in relation to the pharynx; by this it is separated from the prevertebral muscles. If we consider the tip of the epiglottis to represent its upper limit, the larynx in the adult may be regarded as being placed in front of the bodies of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth cer- vical vertebrae; but its posi- tion alters somewhat with the movements of the head and also during deglutition.

On the anterior part of the inner wall of the vestibule there is a circular depression, termed the fovea hemispherical which is bounded behind by a vertical ridge, called the crista vestibuli. The bottom of the fovea hemispherica is perforated by some minute holes which give admission to filaments from the vestibular part of the auditory nerve. On the roof of the vestibule another depression, named the fovea hemi-elliptica^ may be seen. It is placed behind the crista vestibuli. A small aperture placed on the posterior part of the inner vestibule. superior semicircular canal. posterior semicircular canal. foramen rotundum. external semicircular canal.

It is the mouth of the aqueductus vestibuli—a small canal which leads backwards to the posterior surface of the petrous bone, where it opens under the dura mater. Semicircular Canals.—These are three bony canals or tubes placed behind the vestibule. They are bent upon themselves, so that each forms considerably more than half a circle, and they occupy planes at right angles to each other like three faces of a cube. They are termed superior, pos- terior, and external, and they open into the back part of the vestibule by five round orifices, the number of openings being thus reduced through the adjoining extremities of the

THORACIC WALL. 7 terminal branches constitute the anterior cutaneous nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches come off midway between the spine and the sternum, and, piercing the external inter- costal muscles, appear in the intervals between the digita- tions of the serratus magnus. It is not necessary to make a dissection of the intercostal nerves in more than two or three of the spaces. Intercostal Vessels.—The intercostal arteries should be dissected in those spaces in which the nerves have not been traced, and in which, therefore, the internal intercostal muscles are still entire. It is only in a well-injected subject that a satisfactory view of these vessels can be obtained. In each intercostal space 07te artery is found passing from behind forivards and two^ the a?iterior intercostal arteries^ running from before backwards. In the upper two spaces the vessels which run from behind forwards are derived from the superior intercostal branch (truncus costo-cervicalis) of the subclavian artery; in the nine lower spaces they spring directly from the aorta, and are called the aortic intercostal arteries. The afiterior intercostal arteries of the upper six spaces proceed directly from the internal mammary, whilst in the case of the lower spaces they come from the outer of its two terminal branches—viz., the musculo-phrenic artery (PI. n.). The intercostal vessels are for the most part distributed between the two muscular strata. From the angles of the ribs onwards to a point midway between the spine and sternum, the aortic intercostal arteries lie under shelter of the lower margins of the ribs which bound the spaces superiorly, and at a higher level than the corresponding nerves. Here each divides into two branches, and these pass forwards in relation to the upper and lower margins of the intercostal space. They give off small branches which accompany the lateral cutaneous nerves. The superior intercostal arteries are disposed in a similar manner. The

i6 THORAX. surface of the membrane, if healthy, presents an appearance which is characteristic of all serous membranes. It is smooth, polished, and glistening, 'and is moistened by a small amount of serous fluid. It is thus admirably adapted to allow the movements of the lung during respiration to take place with the smallest possible degree of friction. When the surface of the membrane becomes roughened by inflammatory exudation, the so-called "friction sounds" of pleurisy become evident when the ear is applied to the chest. Introduce the hand into the pleural sac, and explore its parietal pleura, -visceral pleura. Fig. 158.â€”Diagram of the two pleural sacs. extent and connections. First carry it inwards behind the costal cartilages. Its passage across the mesial plane of the body is effectually barred by the reflection of the pleural membrane from the back of the sternum to the front of the pericardium. Above the level of the pericardium it passes right back to the vertebral column, and then proceeds out- wards on the ribs. Upon the lateral aspect of the peri- cardium it can be traced backwards towards the spine, and here it must be studied from two points of view, viz. (i) at the level of the root of the lung, and (2) below the root of the lung.

350 HEAD AND NECK. in the thorax, and, crossing the arch of the aorta, ends in the superficial cardiac plexus. The Middle Cervical Ganglion is the smallest of the three ganglia of the neck. It is placed opposite the sixth cervical vertebra in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery, upon which, indeed, it not unfrequently rests. It presents the following branches :— 1. Twigs which connect it with the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, and which pass between the contiguous margins of the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles. 2. Thyroid branches which run to the thyroid body along the inferior thyroid artery, and which form connections with the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. 3. The middle cardiac nerve. On both sides the middle cardiac nerve enters the thorax and is lost in the deep cardiac plexus. In the neck it is connected with the superior cardiac nerve, and with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. On the right side it passes behind or in front of the subclavian artery; on the left side it is continued downwards between the common carotid and subclavian arteries. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is lodged in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. In this position it Hes behind the vertebral artery. It is by no means un- common to find it more or less completely fused over the neck of the first rib with the first thoracic ganglion. Again, the connection between it and the middle ganglion is generally in the form of two or more slender nerve-cords, of which one passes in front of the subclavian artery. The loop which is thus formed is termed the ansa Vieussie7tii. The branches of the inferior cervical ganglion are :—■ 1. Connecting twigs with the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. 2. Rami vasculares. 3. Inferior cardiac nerve. The ra7ni vasculares are fine branches which form a plexus around the subclavian artery and its branches.

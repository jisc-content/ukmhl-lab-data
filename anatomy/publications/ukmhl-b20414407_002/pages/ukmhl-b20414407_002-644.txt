6l2 THE AUDITORY APPARATUS. the posterior bend is the opening of the pyramid. The pyramid is con- nected to the promontory by a little spicule of bone, which has been compared to a flying buttress (Holden). The promontory forms a bold eminence on the inner wall of the tympanum. Above it is placed the fenestra ovalis, below and behind it is the fenestra rotunda. The latter opening is somewhat under the shadow of the promontory. Section III.—In the section from which Fig. 330 is taken, the saw has passed through the cochlea and the vestibule, the superior and ex- FiG. 330.—Vertical section of the left temporal bone parallel to the superior border of the petrous bone, and about one-eighth of an inch anterior to that border. 1.

If the specimen be held up to the light and examined with a pocket-lens, the modiolus will be seen to be pierced by a number of fine holes (lamina cribrosa). At the end of the lowest turn of the cochlea, close to the fenestra rotunda, is the inner opening of the

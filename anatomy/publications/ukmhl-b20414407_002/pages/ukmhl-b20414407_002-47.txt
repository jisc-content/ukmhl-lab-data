25 THORACIC CAVIT\. clothes the ribs and intercostal muscles, and it bears the im- press of the costal arches. The inner surface presents a much smaller area than the outer surface, and is deeply concave in adaptation to the pericardium upon which it fits. As the heart projects more into the left side of the chest, the The two borders of the lung stand in marked contrast to each other. The anterior border is short, thin, and sharp, and extends forwards and inwards in front of the peri- cardium into the narrow pleural recess behind the sternum and costal cartilages {sinus costo-mediastinalis). The pos- terior border of the lung is thick, long, and rounded. It forms the most bulky part of the organ, and occupies the deep hollow of the thoracic cavity which is placed on each side of the spine. During respiration the two surfaces, the posterior border and the lower surface of the base and the apex of the lung always remain in close apposition with the walls of the cavity in which the organ lies. The sharp margin around the base rises and falls in the sinus phrenico- costalis, but it is doubtful if it ever, even in the deepest inspiration, reaches the lowest limit of this recess. The anterior sharp margins of the lungs approach and retreat to a slight degree from each other in Fig. 161.â€”The Lungs. (From Gegenbaur.) s. Superior lobe ; m. Middle lobe ; i.

It is situated some- what nearer the apex than the base, and also nearer the posterior than the an- terior border of the lung. Through the hilum enter the arteries, nerves, and bronchus, whilst through the same slit the veins and lymphatics emerge.

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 157 surface they pierce the splenius, rhomboideus, and trapezius muscles.^ Lumbar Region.—The internal brmtches of the posterior divisions of the five lumbar nerves are of small size, and, like the corresponding twigs in the lower dorsal region, they have a purely muscular distribution. They end in the multifidus spinae muscle. The external branches sink into the substance of the erector spinae, and are concerned in the supply of that muscle, and also of the lumbar intertransverse muscles. The upper three of these nerves are of large size, and become cutaneous by piercing the superficial lamella of the lumbar fascia. They have already been traced by the dissector of the lower Hmb to the skin of the gluteal region. The lowest external branch communicates with the corre- sponding branch of the first sacral nerve. Blood Vessels of the Back.—In the cervical region the dissector has already noticed the arteria profunda cervicis, the second part of the occipital artery, and its branch termed the arteria princeps cervicis. Deep in the sub- occipital region he will subsequently meet with a small portion of the vertebral artery. In addition to these, how- ever, minute twigs may be discovered in a well-injected subject, passing backwards from the vertebral artery, in the intervals between the transverse processes, and also in the sub-occipital space. These supply the muscles, and anasto- mose with the other arteries in this region. In the dorsal region the dorsal branches of the aortic intercostal arteries make their appearance between the trans- verse processes. Each of these vessels reaches this point by passing backwards in the interval between the body of a vertebra and the superior costo-transverse ligament. It is associated with the corresponding posterior primary division ^ The cutaneous distribution of these nerves has already been examined by the dissector of the upper hmb.

THE BRAIN. 530 the posterior end of the brain, and it unites the inner sur- faces of the two cerebral hemispheres throughout very nearly a half of their antero-posterior length. Looked at as a whole, it is highly arched from before backwards, and presents a convex upper surface and a concave lower surface. The upper surface of the corpus callosum forms the bottom of the great longitudinal fissure, and on each side of this it is covered by the callosal convolution.

The upper surface of the callosum is streaked in the transverse direction —an indication that this structure is for the most part com- posed of transversely directed bundles of nerve-fibres passing from one hemisphere to the other. Certain longitudinal markings are also evident in cases where the brain has been carefully preserved. In the mesial plane there is a shallow longitudinal groove, termed the raphe. On either side of

258 HEAD AND NECK. mylo-hyoid muscle towards the chin. Near the symphysis it changes its direction, and is carried upwards over the base of the lower jaw, to end in branches for the muscles and integument of the chin and lower lip. In the submaxillary region it gives numerous twigs to the surrounding muscles, and anastomoses with the sublingual artery by branches which pierce the mylo-hyoid muscle. In the face it anastomoses with the inferior labial branch of the facial and the mental branch of the inferior dental. Facial Vein.—The cervical portion of the facial vein will be noticed passing backwards and downwards, superficial to the submaxillary gland and facial artery. After picking up tributaries corresponding to the branches of the similar part of the artery, it joins the anterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein. The short trunk thus formed is termed the common facial vein, and it pours its blood into the internal jugular at the level of the hyoid bone. The Internal Maxillary Artery (arteria maxillaris interna) will be displayed in the dissection of the pterygo-maxillary space. Occipital Artery (arteria occipitalis).—The occipital artery springs from the posterior aspect of the external carotid at the same level as the facial. It takes the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle as its guide, and runs upwards and backwards to reach the interval between the mastoid process and the transverse process of the atlas. From this onwards it has been studied in the dissection of the scalp and the back of the neck (pp. in, 141, and 151). The first part of the vessel crosses the internal carotid artery, the vagus nerve, the spinal accessory nerve, and the internal jugular vein. The hypoglossal nerve hooks round it, and it is overlapped by the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. The only branches which spring from this portion of the occipital are :—(i) muscular twigs ; and (2) a meningeal branch.

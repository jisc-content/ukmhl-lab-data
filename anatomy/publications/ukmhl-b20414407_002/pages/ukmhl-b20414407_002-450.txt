The posterior superior dental nerve takes origin in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and almost immediately divides into two branches, which proceed downwards upon the posterior aspect of the body of the superior maxillary bone. They contribute a few fine filaments to the mucous membrane of the cheek and to the gum, and then disappear into the minute posterior dental foramina to supply the three Fig. 258.â€”Diagram of the superior maxillary nerve. a.

Anterior superior dental nerve. k. Facial branches of infra-orbital. molar teeth and the lining membrane of the antrum of Highmore. The middle superior dental nerve supplies the two bicuspid teeth. It arises from the infra-orbital nerve, a short dis- tance in front of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and can be easily detected (when present) by gently raising the parent trunk from the floor of the canal. It descends in a minute canal which traverses the outer wall of the antrum of Highmore.

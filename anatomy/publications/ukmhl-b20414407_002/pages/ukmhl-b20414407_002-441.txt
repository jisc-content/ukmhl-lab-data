Somewhat triangular in form, it is broadest in front, where it is bounded by the uprightly placed epiglottis. Behind it is narrow, and ends in the interval between the two arytenoid cartilages ; on either side stretches a sharp fold of mucous membrane, called the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. On either side of the posterior part of the laryngeal open- ing, between the arytenoid cartilage and the posterior part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, there is a small down- wardly directed recess, which presents a wide entrance but THYRO.EPIGLOT.LIC VAGUS.N LONG.COLLI Fig. 257.â€”Transverse section through the neck at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. rapidly narrows towards the bottom (Fig. 257).

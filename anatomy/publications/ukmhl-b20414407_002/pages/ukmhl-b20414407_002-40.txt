THORAX. i8 it is pushed outwards over the lung and lung-root in the form of an investment. But the continuity of the mem- brane in a longitudinal direction must also be established. This inquiry will render clear its relations in the upper and lower parts of the thoracic cavity. In the upper part of the chest cavity, the pleura will be observed to extend upwards through the thoracic inlet into the root of the neck, and to form in this locality a dome-shaped roof for each side of the chest (Fig. 157). This portion of the pleura is called the cervical pleura^ and it passes upwards above the level of the anterior part of the first costal arch for a distance of from i to 2 inches. The height to which it rises varies considerably in different individuals. The subclavian artery arches over and lies in a groove on the inner and anterior aspect of this cul-de-sac near its summit, and the scalenus anticus muscle is in rela- tion to its outer surface. Further, the cervical pleura is supported and strengthened by an aponeurotic expansion {Sibson's fascia) which is spread over it, and receives attach- ment to the inner concave margin of the first rib. This- fascia is derived from a small muscular slip which takes, origin from the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. It may be regarded as a derivative from the scalene group of muscles. In the lower part of the thorax the parietal pleura is reflected from the inner surface of the chest wall on to the upper surface of the diaphragm, and is carried inwards upon this towards the pericardium. This portion of the mem- brane is termed the diaphragmatic pleura. The Lines of Pleural Reflection.â€”The two pleural sacs are not shaped alike. The right pleura is shorter and wider than the left, and consequently the lines along which the two membranes are reflected from the sternum and costal cartilages backwards towards the pericardium, and also from the chest wall on to the diaphragm, differ somewhat on the two sides.

197 SIDE OF THE NECK. The processes and partitions which proceed from the deep surface of the cervical fascia cannot in every case be dis- played at the present stage of the dissection, but it is necessary that they should be described, in order that the student may be able to recognise them and appreciate their bearings as they are unfolded in the subsequent dissection of the neck. Those requiring special notice are :— 1. The prevertebral fascia. 2. The pretracheal fascia. 3. The carotid sheath. 4. The stylo-maxillary ligament. The prevertebral fascia is a strong partition which stretches across the neck immediately in front of the vertebral column and the prevertebral muscles. On either side it extends outwards behind the carotid vessels and the internal jugular vein, to obtain attachment to the layer of the investing aponeurosis which lies on the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle. In an upward direction it can be traced to the base of the skull to which it is fixed, whilst below it passes continuously downwards into the thorax upon the longus colli muscles. The prevertebral fascial septum thus subdivides the investing tube of cervical fascia into—{a) a posterior compartment which contains the vertebral column and the muscles which surround it ; and {b) an anterior or visceral compartment, which contains the pharynx, the larynx, the trachea, the gullet, the thyroid body, and the depressor muscles of the larynx and hyoid bone. It is important to note that there is no barrier interposed between this visceral compartment and the superior medi- astinal space of the thoracic cavity. The pretracheal fascia is a partition of no great strength, which springs from the deep aspect of the lamella clothing the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid. It passes right across the visceral compartment of the neck in front of the thyroid body and trachea, and behind the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, the sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles.

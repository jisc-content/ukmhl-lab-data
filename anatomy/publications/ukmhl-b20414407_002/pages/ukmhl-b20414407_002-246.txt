Carotid Triangle.—During the dissection of the carotid triangle the following parts are displayed :— ' I. Common carotid dividing into external and internal carotid arteries. 2. Superior thyroid. 3. Lingual. Branches of the 4. Facial. I external Arteries<( 5. Occipital. carotid. 6. Ascending phar^mgeal. J 7. Hyoid. Branches of the superior thyroid. Veins 8. Sterno-mastoid. 9. Superior laryngeal. ,10. Sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital. 1. Internal jugular. 2. Facial. ^ 3. Anterior temporo-maxillary. 4. Lingual. 5. Superior thyroid. Tributaries of the internal jugular. I. Hypoglossal, Crossing the space in a transverse direction. 2. Descendens hypoglossi. ^, 3. Nerve to thyro-hyoid. Crossing Nerves < 4. Internal laryngeal. r the space 5. External laryngeal. obliquely. 6. Spinal accessory. J 7. Vagus. ) Descending 8. Sympathetic. J vertically. Intercarotic body. Portion of the larynx and pharynx. Greater cornu of the hyoid bone. Lymphatic vessels and glands. This subdivision of the anterior triangle, when opened up, contains portions of each of the three carotid arteries. It therefore receives the name of carotid triangle. It is well, however, that the dissector should clearly understand that it is only after the parts are relaxed by dissection that these vessels come to lie within the space. When the fascia and

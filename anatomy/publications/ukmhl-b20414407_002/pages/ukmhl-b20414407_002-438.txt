HEAD AND NECK. 4o8 various apertures with the mucous membrane of the nasal fossae, of the Eustachian tubes, of the buccal cavity, of the larynx, and of the oesophagus. The glands in connection with the mucous membrane of the pharynx are of two kinds—viz., racemose and follicular. The racemose glands will be noticed to form a thick layer on the lateral and posterior aspects of the upper part of the pharyngeal wall. They gradually diminish in number as they are followed downwards, and opposite the isthmus faucium they are separated from each other by considerable intervals. The follicular glands are similar in character to those which are observed on the root of the tongue, and to those which constitute the tonsils. In some localities they occur in an isolated condition, in others they are collected together in masses of different sizes. One aggregation of considerable size is placed upon the upper part of the pos- terior wall of the pharynx, where this joins the roof. It is termed the pharyngeal tonsil (Luschka), and is of some clinical importance. It is oval in form, and about half-an inch in length (Fig. 256). The soft palate which hangs like a curtain over the isthmus faucium may be regarded as dividing the pharynx into an upper and a lower part. The upper portion or naso- pharynx (cavum pharyngo-nasale) is placed behind the nasal fossae and remains always patent (Fig. 256). It presents four apertures through which it is brought into connection with the nasal chambers and the tympanic cavities—viz., the two choanae or posterior nares, and the mouths of the two Eustachian tubes. The posterior nares or choance are two large oval openings, placed immediately below the base of the skull, which look directly backwards into the naso-pharynx. They constitute the communication between the nasal fossae and the pharynx, and are separated from each other by the thin posterior border of the vomer bone. The vertical diameter of each opening measures about one inch, whilst the

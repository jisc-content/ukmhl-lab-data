THORACIC CAVITY. 43 The Auricular Part of the heart stands in marked con- trast with the firm ventricular portion. Its walls are thin and flaccid, and in the uninjected heart they are collapsed, so that it is difficult to realise the shape of this portion of the organ. It is crescentic in form. The chief bulk of it is placed behind, but it sends forwards two processes or cornua, termed the auricular appendices. A deep con- cavity or hollow is thus produced, in which lie the two great arterial trunks which spring from the ventricles, viz., the pulmonary artery in front and the aorta behind. The ac- companying diagram, which represents a transverse sec- tion through the auricular portion of the heart, will serve to illustrate this point (Fig. 168). On the posterior aspect of the auricular part of the heart a faintly marked groove extends upwards in a vertical direction from the auriculo-ventricular furrow (Figs. 167 and 168). This groove passes over the top of the auricular part, and then downwards in front of it. It corresponds to the internal attachment of the inter- auricular septum (septum atriorum), which intervenes be- tween the right and left auricular cavities, and therefore it is termed the interauricular furrow. The posterior capacious part of each auricle is somewhat quadrangular in shape, and is called the atrhun: the prolongation for- wards on either side of the great arterial trunks is termed the auricular appendix (auricula). It should be noted that the left auricle forms a greater part of the posterior wall of the auricular portion of the ■ ;0 iB\ 11 L.A Fig. 168.—Transverse section through the auricular part of the heart.

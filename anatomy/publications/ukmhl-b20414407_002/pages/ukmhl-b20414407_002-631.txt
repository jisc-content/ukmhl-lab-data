MEMBRANA TYMPANL 599 almost surrounds the tendon of the tensor tympani, and forms a pulley upon which the tendon plays. Below the hinder end of the promontory is the fenestra rotunda^ an aperture which, in the macerated bone, leads into the cavity of the cochlea, but which in the recent state, is closed by a membrane which is stretched across it, and receives the name of the secondary membrane of the tympa?tum. The outer wall of the tympanic cavity is formed for the most part by the membrana tympani. Membrana Tympani.— The membrana tympani is an elliptical disc of mem- brane which is stretched across the bottom of the meatus auditorius externus, so as to form the greater part of the outer wall of the tympanum. It is placed very obliquely; its lower and its fore border both incline inwards. With a horizontal plane it forms an angle which varies from about 40° to 45°. Its mode of attachment around the bottom of the attention. Here, there is a Fig. 320.—Schematic representa- tion of the membrana tympani and the malleus. (From Testut.) 1.

Tympanic cavity. meatus is deserving of some ring-like ridge of bone very distinctly grooved which forms as it were a frame in which the membrane is set. But this ridge is deficient above, and at this point there is a deep notch (the notch of Rivinus) between the extremities of the bony ridge. This notch is occupied by a portion of the membrane which is not so dense in its texture (see-

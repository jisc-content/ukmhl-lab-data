Septum Linguae.—The septum of the tongue can best be seen by making a transverse section through the organ. This will also in a measure demonstrate the stratum trans- versum and stratum perpendiculare of muscular fibres. The septum is a mesially placed fibrous partition. It is strongest behind, where it is attached to the hyoid bone. THE BRAIN. Du'ections.—In the first instance the brain should be placed on a dissecting-room platter, with its superior surface uppermost. As it has in all probability been removed from strong spirit, it is necessary to keep it moist during the whole dissection, by means of a cloth dipped in water. Unless this be done the membranes are apt to become dry, and then they are exceedingly difficult to remove. General Appearance of the Brain.—When viewed from above the brain presents an ovoid figure, its broad end being directed backwards. Its greatest transverse diameter is in the neighbourhood of the parietal eminences. The only parts which are visible when the brain is in this posi- tion are the two convoluted cerebral hemispheres. These are separated from each other by a deep mesial cleft, called the great longitudinal fissure, which extends from the front to the back of the brain. The position of the brain should now be reversed. Turn it so that it rests on its superior surface. The inferior aspect of the brain is usually termed the "base." It presents an uneven and irregular surface, which is more or less accurately adapted to the inequalities on the floor of the cranium. From this point of view some of the main subdivisions of the organ may be recognised. Thus, behind is seen the short cylindrical portion, called

436 HEAD AND NECK. olfactory region comprises the upper and middle turbinated bones with the superior meatus; the respii-atory region includes the inferior turbinated bone, the middle meatus, the lower meatus, and the greater part of the atrium. In the lower part of the outer wall the mucous membrane is thick and spongy. This is particularly noticeable over the lower borders and posterior extremities of the middle and inferior turbinated bones, where the membrane presents an irregular surface and forms soft bulging cushions. This condition is largely due to the presence of a rich venous plexus, the vessels of which run for the most part in an antero-posterior direction. In the case of the lower spongy bone, the veins are so numerous that the mucous membrane assumes the character of cavernous tissue, and is sometimes spoken of as the " erectile body." When turgid with blood, it swells out so as to obliterate the interval between the turbinal bone and the septum. The mucous membrane of the floor, meatuses, and the atrium, is smoother and not so thick as that over the turbinated bones. Everywhere numerous racemose glands are embedded in its midst, and the minute punctiform orifices of the ducts are visible to the naked eye. In the olfactory region the lining mem- brane of the nose (called the olfactory or Schneiderian mem- brane) in the fresh state is of a yellowish colour, and is softer and more delicate than in the respiratory part. The great vascularity of the mucous membrane of the nose is doubtless for the purpose of moistening and raising the temperature of the inspired air.

465 THE LARYNX. Ada??u. This is more prominent in its upper part than below, and is always more marked in the male than in the female. From the pomum Adami the two alae diverge backwards and outwards, like the limbs of the letter \J, so as to enclose between them the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages. The upper border of each ala is somewhat convex, but in front it is cut away or bevelled off, so that with the corresponding part of the opposite ala a deep median notch is formed. This is called the incisura thyroidea. The lower bor- der is nearly straight, but is subdivided by a slight tubercle into an anterior and a posterior concave part. The posterior border is thick and rounded and gives attachment to the Fig. 269.—Cartilages of larynx seen fibres of the stylo-pharyn- from the front. (From Luschka.) geus and palato-pharyngeus 1.

The shorter, stronger mferior cornu curves slightly inwards. On the inner aspect of its tip there is a facet which articulates with the side of the cricoid cartilage. The outer surface of the ala is flat. VOL. II.—30

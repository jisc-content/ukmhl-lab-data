HEAD AND NECK. 342 nerve is joined by a branch from the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve, and, after the junction is effected, it is termed the small superficial petrosal 7ie7^e. The canal in which the small superjicial petrosal nerve is lodged opens into the cranial cavity upon the anterior face of the petrous bone, immediately external to the hiatus Fallopii. Through this the nerve emerges, and soon leaves the interior of the cranium by passing down- wards in the interval between the great wing of the sphenoid and the petrous bone. Outside the skull it ends by joining the otic ganglion. In the tympanic cavity the tympanic 7terve gives branches of supply— Fig. 240.—Diagram of the tympanic nerve. (Modified from Henle.) a.

(i) to the mucous membrane of the tympanum ; (2) to the lining mem- brane of the mastoid cells (Fig. 240,/, 0); and (3) to the mucous mem- brane of the Eustachian tube (Fig. 240,/). It also gives off a fine branch termed the small deep superjicial petrosal nerve (n. petrosus profundus minor). This enters a canal in the processus cochleariformis which conducts it to the foramen lacerum medium, where it effects a junction with the carotid plexus. The tympanic nerve likewise receives a minute twig from the carotid plexus which is called the nervus carotico- tympanicus.

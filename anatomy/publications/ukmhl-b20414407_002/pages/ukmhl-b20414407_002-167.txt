139 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. The SDiall occipital nerve—Fig. 197 (9)—springs from the anterior primary division of the second cervical nerve, and runs upwards to assist in the supply of the integument over the occiput. Its terminal twigs have already been dissected in the superficial fascia of the scalp (p. 109). Occasionally the small occipital is represented by two separate nerves. Dissection.—The great auricular nerve can readily be exposed by drawing the head well over to the opposite side and then dividing the fascia over the outer surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle very obliquely. Begin the incision at the posterior margin of the muscle about the middle of the neck, and carry it upwards and forwards towards the lobule of the ear. Great auricular or auriculo-parotidean nerve—Fig. 186 (9).—The great auricular nerve is a branch of the cervical 6. Fig. 197.—Superficial dissection of the posterior aspect of the neck and head.

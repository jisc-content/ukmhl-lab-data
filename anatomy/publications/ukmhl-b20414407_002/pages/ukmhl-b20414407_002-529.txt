499 BASE OF BRAIN. The Olfactory Nerves arise from the olfactory bulb or lobe, and enter the nasal chamber through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. General Connections of the Several Parts of the Brain. —Before proceeding to the more particular study of the different parts of the brain, it is well that the student should acquire a general conception of the manner in which these are connected with each other. In the posterior cranial Fig. 282.—Diagrammatic view of the manner in which the several parts of the brain are connected with each other. (From Schwalbe). fossa, below the tentorium, are placed the medulla oblongata, the pons Varolii, and the cerebellum. These structures surround a cavity which is called the fourth ventricle of the brain, and all stand in intimate connection with each other. The medulla oblongata is for the most part carried upwards into the pons Varolii, but at the same time two large strands on its posterior or dorsal aspect, termed the restiform bodies, are prolonged into the cerebellum, and constitute

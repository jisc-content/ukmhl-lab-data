On each side, however, the lateral part of the same membrane is not attached to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, but slopes upwards and inwards, and very materially diminishes the transverse width of the lower subdivision of the laryngeal cavity in its upper part. The attachments which it effects are very definite. Beloiv it is fixed to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, immedi- ately subjacent to the mu- cous membrane ; in front it is attached to the lower half of the inner surface of the ala of the thyroid carti- lage, close to the angle; and behind to the lower border of the processus vocaHs of the arytenoid cartilage. Above it is directly continu- ous with the inferior thyro- arytenoid ligament or true vocal cord. The latter, in- deed, may be looked upon as constituting its upper, thickened, free border. In contact with its outer surface are the lateral crico-arytenoid and the thyro-arytenoid muscles, whilst its inner surface is clothed by the lining mucous membrane of the larynx. The Inferior Thyro-arytenoid Ligament or true vocal cord is formed in connection with the upper free border of the lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane. It is attached in front, close to its fellow of the opposite side, to the middle of the angular depression between the two alse of the thyroid cartilage. From this it stretches backwards, and is fixed behind to the tip and upper border of the processus vocalis, which projects forwards from the base of the arytenoid cartilage.

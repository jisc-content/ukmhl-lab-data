THORACIC CAVITY. 77 of the posterior part of the superior mediastinum, and many of the structures in the one are prolonged downwards into the other. The arbitrary upper hmit of the posterior mediastinum is the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra. In front, it is bounded by the pericardium, except in its very lowest portion, where the anterior wall is formed by the posterior surface of the diaphragm (Fig. i8i). Behind, it is limited by the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae below the fourth, and on each side by the mediastinal pleura as it passes back from the pericardium to the spine. In transverse section its outline is quadrilateral. Figures i8o Inorcccic ao)\ — yen a cava injT T/1,0 TO. c ic clu ct. Fig. i8o.—Tracing of section through the posterior media- stinum at the level of the eighth dorsal vertebra. and i8i are taken from tracings of transverse sections through the space. They serve to show the character of the space and the relative positions of some of the more important contents. The following is a list of the struc- tures which it contains :—- 1. The descending thoracic aorta. 2. The oesophagus. 3. The pneumogastric nerves. 4. The thoracic duct. 5. The vena azygos major. 6. Certain of the right aortic inter- costal arteries. 7. The vena azygos minor superior. 8. The vena azygos minor inferior. 9. The great splanchnic nerves. 10. Some lymphatic glands.

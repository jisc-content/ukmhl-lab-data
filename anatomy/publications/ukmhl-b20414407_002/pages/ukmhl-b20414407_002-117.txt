THORACIC CAVITY. 95 the right side of the thoracic duct and the aorta. In the thorax it extends upwards upon the bodies of the dorsal vertebrse and over the right intercostal arteries, until it reaches the level of the upper border of the root of the right lung. At this point it hooks forwards over the right bronchus, and ends by joining the superior vena cava. It is situated in the posterior mediastinum, with the aorta and thoracic duct lying to the left (Figs. i8o and i8i). The tributaries of the vena azygos major are as follows : —(i) the superior intercostal vein of the right side; (2) the intercostal veins of the eight lower spaces of the right side; (3) the vena azygos minor superior; (4) the vena azygos minor inferior; (5) the bronchial vein from the right lung; (6) certain of the oesophageal veins; (7) some minute pericardiac veins. The vena azygos major communicates below with some of the lumbar veins—tributaries of the inferior vena cava; whilst above, it pours its blood into the superior vena cava. In this way it forms a link by which the superior vena cava is brought into connection with the inferior vena cava. Vena Azygos Minor Superior (vena hemiazygos acces- soria).—This vein is formed on the left side of the body by the union of the intercostal veins of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth spaces. It communicates above with the left superior intercostal vein, which carries the blood from the second and third intercostal spaces to the left innominate vein. At the level of the eighth dorsal vertebra it turns inwards behind the aorta and thoracic duct, and crossing the middle line ends by joining the vena azygos major. In many cases, however, it joins the vena azygos minor inferior. In addition to the intercostal veins it receives the left bronchial vein. The Vena Azygos Minor Inferior (vena hemiazygos).— This vein takes origin within the abdomen as the left ascend- ing lumbar vei?i. It enters the thorax by piercing the left

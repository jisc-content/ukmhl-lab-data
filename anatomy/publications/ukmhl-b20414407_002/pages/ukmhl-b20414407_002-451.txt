421 THE OTIC GANGLION. The anterior superior dental nerve^ much the largest of the three dental branches, springs from the infra-orbital as it approaches the fore part of the canal. It can be brought into view by raising the parent trunk from the floor of the canal, and it will then be seen to enter a special bony tunnel which traverses the upper jaw in front of the antrum of Highmore. The dissector should endeavour to open up this canal with the chisel. After supplying a branch to the mucous membrane of the lower and fore part of the nasal fossa, the anterior superior dental nerve divides into branches for the incisor and the canine teeth. While traversing the upper jaw, the three superior dental branches communicate with each other, and form two nerve-loops. Numerous twigs proceed from these, and join in a fine plexus. It is from this plexus that the terminal filarnents to the teeth and gum take origin. The Infra-orbital Artery is a branch of the internal maxillary. It arises in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and accompanies the infra-orbital nerve. In the face its terminal twigs anastomose with branches of the facial, transverse facial, and buccal arteries ; in the infra-orbital canal it gives some fine branches to the contents of the orbital cavity, and also the anterior dental artery (arteria alveolaris superior anterior), which accompanies the nerve of that name, and supplies the incisor and canine teeth, and the lining mem- brane of the antrum. The infra-orbital vein joins the pterygoid plexus. OTIC GANGLION—NASAL FOSS^ — MECKEL'S GANGLION—INTRAPETROUS PORTION OF THE FACIAL NERVE. Dissection. — The portion of the lower jaw which still remains, together with the tongue and larynx, must now be removed from the upper part of the skull. From the angle of the mouth on each side carry the knife backwards through the buccinator and mucous membrane of the cheek, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the lateral wall of the

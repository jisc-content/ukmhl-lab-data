52 THORAX. of the right ventricle is rendered extremely irregular by the projection of fleshy ridges called coluvmcB carnecB (trabeculae carneae). It is customary to describe these as presenting three different forms—{a) simple elongated ridges; {b) fleshy slips or trabecule free throughout the greater part of their extent, but fixed to the wall by their two extremities; {c) conical fleshy projections of considerable size, which project into the cavity, and are attached by their bases only. These last are called viusculi papil- lares, and are arranged so as to form an anterior and a posterior set. The free end of each of these papillary muscles gives origin to several delicate thread-like ten- Fig. 171.—Transverse section through dons—chordce ten- t^e ventricular part of the heart. and stretch across the ventricular cavity to the septum, to which it is attached. This is the moderator band. By fixing the yielding anterior wall of the ventricle to the more solid septum, it is said to prevent over distension of the cavity. There are two openings in the right ventricle—(i) the auricido-ventricular^ which gives admission to the stream of blood; (2) the pulmo?zary, through which the blood passes di?tece — and by these they are brought into connection with the seg- ments of the auriculo- ventricular valve. A transverse fleshy band will be noticed to spring from the base of the an- terior papillary muscle. (From LuscHKA.) 1. Cavity of right ventricle. 2. Cavity of left ventricle. 3.

596 THE AUDITORY APPARATUS. toidal antrum and air-cells, whilst in front the Eustachian tube opens into it and brings it into connection with the cavity of the pharynx. It contains the chain of auditory ossicles which cross from its outer to its inner wall, and it is lined by delicate mucous membrane. The vertical depth and the antero-posterior length of the tympanic cavity is about half-an-inch in each case. Its width, however, from side to side, is not more than a sixth- of-an-inch, and as both its outer and inner walls bulge into the cavity, its width in the centre is thereby still further reduced. It presents for examination a roof and a floor with four walls, viz., anterior, posterior, external, and internal. The roof is composed of a very thin plate of bone termed the tegmen tympani. This separates it from the cranial cavity. In chronic inflamma- tory conditions of the middle ear an extension of the inflam- matory process to the meninges of the brain is always to be apprehended. The floor is also formed by a thin osseous lamina, which is interposed between the tympanum and the jugular fossa, which lodges the internal jugular vein. An extension of an inflammatory condition of the middle ear in this direc- tion, therefore, might lead to thrombosis. The posterior wall presents, in its upper part, the opening into the mastoidal antrum, and below this, close to the inner wall, a small hollow conical projection termed the pyrajuid. This is perforated on its summit, and the aperture leads into a canal which curves backwards and then downwards until it finally opens into the lower part of the last stage of the Fallopian aqueduct. This curved canal lodges the stapedius- FiG. 318.â€”Schematic vertical section through the tpii- panum. (From Testut.) 1. External meatus. 2. Tympanic ca^-itj-. 3. Promontory- or inner wall. 4.

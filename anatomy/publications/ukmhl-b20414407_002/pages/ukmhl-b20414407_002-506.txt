The inferior lingual muscle (Hnguahs inferior) is a rounded fleshy belly which is placed upon the inferior aspect of the tongue. Behind, it lies in the interval between the hyo- glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus and shows an attachment to the hyoid bone; in front, it is prolonged to the apex of the tongue between the inner border of the stylo-glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus ; with the former it is more or less blended. The transverse muscular fibres (stratum transversum) lie under the lingualis superior, and constitute a thick layer which extends outwards from the lateral face of the septum linguae, to reach the dorsum and side of the tongue. The fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus ascend through the stratum transversum and break it up into numerous lamellae (Fig. 273 d). It is joined by the fibres of the palato-glossus (Henle) (Fig. 272). The vertical muscular fibres (stratum perpendiculare) ex- tend in a curved direction from the dorsum to the under c Fig. 273.â€”Longitudinal section through the tongue. (From Aeby.) e.

HEAD AND NECK. 230 the two laminae of the fascial sheath which retains the tendon in position. The branch for the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles is a nerve which breaks up along their outer margins into a number of twigs for their supply. One small filament may sometimes be traced into the thorax, where it communicates with the phrenic and cardiac nerves. The thyro-hyoid nerve is a slender twig which comes off from the hypoglossal as it approaches the hyoid bone. It supplies the thyro-hyoid muscle. Sterno-Clavicular Articulation.—The dissector must now examine the sterno-clavicular joint, as the next step consists in the disarticulation of the clavicle and the reflection of the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The structures which hold the two bones in position at this joint are the following :— Ligaments proper. /'Anterior sterno-clavicular. (Posterior sterno-clavicular, . ^ r Interclavicular. Accessory ligaments. , . , , , . ■, t ^osto-clavicular or rhomboid. Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Dissecticn.—To expose these ligaments the origin of the pectoralis major from the clavicle and the manubrium sterni must be removed. The sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid is also, to a certain extent, in the way, but it is not advisable to divide this. Sterno-Clavicular Ligaments.—These are placed one in front and the other behind the joint, but they are not isolated sharply-defined bands. Above, they are united by their margins with the interclavicular ligament, whilst below they run into each other so as to constitute in this manner a capsule for the joint (capsula articularis). The a?iterior sterno-clavicular ligameiit springs from the front of the inner end of the clavicle, and proceeds obliquely downwards and inwards to gain attachment to the anterior aspect of the manubrium sterni. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament has a corresponding position, and presents similar attach- ments on the posterior aspect of the joint.

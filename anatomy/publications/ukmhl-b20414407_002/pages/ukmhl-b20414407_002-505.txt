475 THE TONGUE. the mucous membrane will expose a group of glands aggregated together, so as to form a small oval mass on each side of the mesial plane. The stylo-glossus will be observed to run along the side of the tongue to the tip where the two muscles become to a certain extent continuous. The hyo-glossus extends upwards to the side of the tongue, and its fibres pass for the most part under cover of those of the stylo-glossus to reach the dorsum, over the posterior part of which they spread out beneath the mucous membrane. The genio-hyo-glossus sends its fibres vertically upwards into the tongue on each side of the mesial septum, and its insertion stretches from the tip to the base. The fibres of the palato-glossus become con- tinuous with those which form the stratum transversum. The chondro-glossus is not always present. It is separated from the deep surface of the hyo-glossus by the lingual vessels, and by the pharyngeal slip of the genio-hyo-glossus. It is a slender muscular band which takes origin from the inner aspect of the root of the lesser cornu, and the adjoining part of the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres ascend to enter the tongue, and finally spread out on the dorsum under cover of the lingualis superior. The superficial lingual inuscle (lingualis superior) is a continuous layer of longitudinal fibres which covers the entire dorsum linguae, from the root to the tip, immediately beneath the mucous membrane.

HEAD AND NECK. 172 The ligamenta denticulata arachnoid space into an an- terior and a posterior com- partment. In the anterior compartment the anterior nerve-roots pass outwards; the posterior compartment contains the posterior nerve- roots, and is imperfectly sub- divided into two lateral sub- divisions by the septum pos- ticum. By means of the ligamen- tum denticulatum of either side, the spinal cord is sus- pended in the middle of the sac of dura mater. Spinal Cord.—The spinal cord itself may now be studied in situ. It is a cylindrical structure, slightly flattened in front and behind, which extends from the mar- gin of the foramen magnum, where it is continuous with the medulla oblongata of the brain, to the lower border of the body of the first or the upper border of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. Its lower end rapidly tapers to a point, and is termed the conus medullaris. From the extremity of this, a slender filament, termed the filum terminale or central liga ially subdivide the sub- FiG. 20I.—Lateral view of the spinal cord, dura mater, and ligamentum denticulatum. — (HiRSCHFELD and Leveille.)

It is closely adherent to the crista galli, to the posterior margins of the lesser wings of the sphenoid, to the posterior clinoid processes, to the petrous portions of the temporal bones, to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and around the margin of the foramen magnum. Another cause of its close adhesion in this locality is, that it gives sheaths to the cranial nerves, and passes out of the cranium through the basal foramina to become continuous with the periosteum on the external surface of the skull. So close, indeed, is the union between the dura mater and the base of the cranium, that it would require maceration to effect a complete separation. Partitions of Dura Mater.—The dura mater gives off, as we have already seen, processes which act as partial parti- tions within the cranial cavity. These are four in number, viz. :— (i.) The falx cerebri (which has already been studied). (2.) The tentorium cerebelli. (3.) The falx cerebelli. (4.) The diaphragma sellse. Tentorium Cerebelli.—Fig. 192 (4), and Fig. 191 (4), p. 119. This is a large crescentic fold of dura mater which constitutes a membranous roof for the posterior fossa of the cranium, and at the same time forms a partition between the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. It is not horizontal. It is accurately applied to the upper surface of the cerebellum. Its highest point, therefore, is in front, in the mesial plane, and from this it gradually slopes downwards to its attached border. A very imperfect idea of its natural appearance can be obtained in the present instance, seeing that its connections have been severed in the removal of the brain. Before it is disturbed it is per- fectly tense, and this tension is due to its connection with the falx cerebri. These two processes of dura mater are mutually dependent on each other in this respect—divide one and both become relaxed.

SIDE OF THE NECK. 245 The cervical plexus thus formed has very definite relations. It lies under cover of the upper part of the sternormastoid I., II., III., IV.â€”Anterior primary divisions of the upper four cervical nerves. R. Branches to recti muscles. G.A. Great auricular. S.M. Branches to the sterno-mastoid. S.O. Small occipital. T.C. Superficial cervical. L.A.S. Branches to levator anguli scapulae. D.T. Descending trunk. C. Communicating to fifth cervical. P. Phrenic. C.C. Rami communicantes hypo- glossi. C. H. Communicating branch to hypo- glossal. H. Hypoglossal. T.H. Thyro-hyoid nerve. D. H. Descendens hypoglossi. A. H. Ansa hypoglossi. This diagram shows that the descendens hypoglossi, the branch to the thyro-hyoid, and in all probability the branches to the genio- hyoid, are composed of fibres given to the hypoglossal by the com- municating twigs it receives from the first cervical nerve. and in front of the scalenus medius and the levator anguli scapulae muscles.

THE BRAIN. 548 noticed on the floor of the lateral ventricle which intervenes between the thalamus and the caudate nucleus—a groove which contains the vein of the corpus striatum and the taenia semicircularis. On the inner side the superior surface of the thalamus is separated in its anterior half from the internal or mesial surface by a sharp edge, or rather by a somewhat prominent ledge, produced by a small white strand, termed the stria fornicis or the stria pinealis. Posteriorly, this stria leads to the pineal body, whilst anteriorly it runs into the anterior pillar of the for- nix. The superior surface of the thalamus is slightly bulging or convex, and is of a whitish colour owing to the presence of a thin superficial coating of nerve fibres (stratum zonale). It is divided into two areas by a faint oblique groove which begins in front a short distance behind the anterior extremity of the thalamus, and extends obliquely outwards and back- wards. This sulcus corre- sponds to the free edge of the fornix. The two areas thus mapped out are very differently related to the ven- tricles of the brain. The outer area includes the anterior extremity of the thalamus, and forms a part of the floor of the lateral ventricle; it is covered with ependyma, and overlapped by the choroid plexus (Fig. 297). The inner area intervenes between the lateral and third ventricles of the brain, and takes no part in the formation of the walls of either. It is covered by the velum interpositum, above which is the fornix. It includes the posterior extremity of the thalamus. Fig. 299.—Upper surface of the left thalamus.

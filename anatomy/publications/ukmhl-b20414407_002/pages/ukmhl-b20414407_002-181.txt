DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 151 point where it pierces the trapezius to become superficial, can now be fully exposed. To effect this, the trachelo-mastoid must be divided a short distance below its insertion, and along with the splenius capitis thrown upwards as far as possible. Occipital Artery (arteria occipitalis).—The second part of the occipital artery is now displayed. In the region of the mastoid process it is very deeply placed; indeed, no less than five structures lie superficial to it. These are (enumerating them in order from the vessel outwards) —(i) the origin of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle; (2) the mastoid process; (3) the trachelo- mastoid ; (4) the splenius capitis; and (5) the sterno- mastoid.i As the artery runs backwards, it very soon emerges from under cover of the first three of these struc- tures, and a little farther on it leaves the shelter of the splenius; so that it is covered by the sterno-mastoid alone. Issuing from under cover of the posterior border of this muscle, the artery crosses the apex of the posterior triangle, and disappears under the trapezius, which it finally pierces near the external occipital protuberance, to reach the scalp. Two muscles constitute its deep relations—viz., the insertion of the superior oblique and the complexus. The following bra?iches may be traced from this portion of the occipital artery :— 1. Arteria princeps cervicis. 2. Mastoid. 3. Muscular. The arteria prmceps cervicis (ramus descendens) is a twig of some size, which gives off a small branch to the deep surface of the splenius, and then sinks under cover of the complexus, where it will be subsequently dissected. The small mastoid artery (ramus mastoideus) enters the ^ It is not uncommon to find the artery at this point of its course nearer the surface. It may pass backwards between the splenius and the trachelo-mastoid.

HEAD AND NECK. 204 only after the fascial connections of the muscle have been divided that the triangle becomes well marked. Cases also occur in which the omo-hyoid takes partial or complete origin from the clavicle, and thus the supra-clavicular space is still further reduced in size. Another condition which materially affects the dimensions of the supra-clavicular triangle is the muscular development of the subject. The more powerful the neck, the more extensive are the attachments of the trapezius and sterno-mastoid to the clavicle, and the narrower in consequence is the triangle. In a few instances these muscles will be observed to meet on the clavicle, and thus obliterate the space altogether. This latter condition, however, is not necessarily associated with a specially high development of the muscles. In the supra-clavicular space a great number of highly important structures are collected together within a very limited area. The great blood vessels and nerves which pass from the neck to the upper limb traverse this space. Its contents are the following :— {Subclavian. Transversalis colli. Supra-scapular. External jugular. Supra-scapular. Veins Transversalis colli. 3 '''^^i Subclavian. Nerves—The trunks of the brachial plexus and their branches Lymphatic glands. Subclavian Artery (arteria subclavia).—It is only the third part of the subclavian artery which is included in the supra-clavicular triangle. This portion of the vessel extends from the outer margin of the scalenus anticus to the outer border of the first rib. Here it enters the axilla and becomes the axillary artery. It takes a very oblique course; at first it lies at a variable distance above the level of the clavicle, but as it runs from above downwards and outwards, it finally comes to lie behind the clavicle and the subclavius muscle. It is this portion of the artery that the surgeon selects, when the choice lies in his own hands, as the seat for apply-

371 THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. artery. It pierces the optic nerve about a half an inch behind the eyeball, and is conducted in its substance to the interior of the globe of the eye. The ciliary arteries are very numerous. Two groups are recognised—viz., a posterior and an anterior. The posterior ciliary arteries run with the ciliary nerves. They arise by two trunks which spring from the ophthalmic whilst it lies below the optic nerve. These divide into several slender branches, which pierce the sclerotic around the entrance of Fig. 244.—Diagram of the ophthalmic artery and its branches. (After QuAiN and Meyer, modified.) the optic nerve. Two members of this group of vessels enter the eyeball on either side of the optic nerve, somewhat apart from the others. They are termed the long ciliary arteries (arteriae ciliares posteriores longge) (Fig. 243). The anterior ciliary arteries (arteriae ciliares anteriores) come off in the fore part of the orbit from the lachrymal and muscular branches. They vary in number from six to eight, and run to the anterior part of the eyeball, where they form an

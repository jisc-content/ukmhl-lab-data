THORACIC WALL. 9 has been properly executed, a strong fascia will be observed to pass from the surface of the diaphragm on to the surface of the costal pleura so as to hold it in position. Preserve this for further examination. The Internal Mammary Artery (arteria mammaria in- terna) arises in the root of the neck from the first part of the subclavian, and enters the thorax, by passing downwards behind the inner end of the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib. Accompanied by two veins, it descends to the interval between the sixth and seventh costal cartilages, where it ends by dividing into the superior epigastric and the musculo-phrefiic branches. It runs parallel with the outer margin of the sternum, from which it is separated by an interval of about half-an-inch. Placed in front of the internal mammary artery are the upper six costal cartilages, with the intervening intercostal muscles and anterior intercostal membranes. It is crossed by the series of intercostal nerves before they turn forwards to gain the surface. In the upper part of its course the artery is supported by the pleura, but lower down it rests upon the triangularis sterni which intervenes between it and the pleural sac. In addition to its two terminal branches, a large number of small collateral twigs proceed from the internal mammary— 1. The anterior intercostal, • 1 ^ ,u ^, ^ . J-to the thoracic parietes. 2.

J The anterior intercostal arteries (rami intercostales) are supplied to the upper six intercostal intervals, and have already been dissected (p. 7). Two are given to each space: frequently these arise by a common trunk. The perforating arteries (rami perforantes) accompany the anterior cutaneous nerves, and reach the surface by piercing the internal intercostal muscles, the anterior intercostal mem-

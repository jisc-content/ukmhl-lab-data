30 THORAX. Dissection.—The pulmonary vessels and the bronchus should now be separated from each other with the handle of the knife, and their relative positions in the root of the lung studied. This dissection should be made, not only in front, but also behind, so that the parts may be thoroughly isolated and rendered distinct. Hardened and blackened bronchial glands sometimes make the dissection a difficult one. These must be removed. The puhnofiary veins are placed most anteriorly and the bronchus most posteriorly, whilst the pulmonary artery is i?iter??iediate in position. When examined in respect to their relations from above downwards, the right and left puhiionary roots are seen to differ from each other. On both sides the veins occupy the lowest level. On the right side the bronchus is highest and the artery intermediate, whereas on the left side the artery is highest and the bronchus intermediate in position. The different position of the bronchus in the roots of the lungs is not due to any differ- ence in the direction of the main stems or trunks of the tubes, but to the fact that on the right side a branch arises from the bronchus close to its origin, and proceeds almost horizontally outwards to the upper lobe of the lung. This division, which is not represented on the left side, lies above the level of the pulmonary artery, and in consequence receives the name of the eparterial bronchus. The other branches of the right bronchus, and all the branches of the left bronchus, lie below the level of the main trunk of the corresponding pulmonary artery, and are termed hyparterial bronchi. The relation of parts in the roots of the two lungs may be shortly expressed thus :— From Before Backwards, {Veins. Artery. Bronchus. From Above Downwards. r Artery. r Bronchus.

451 THE LARYNX. the middle of the laryngeal cavity, of which it constitutes the narrowest part. In front it corresponds to the interval between the true vocal cords ; behind it corresponds to the interval between the bases and vocal processes of the ary- tenoid cartilages (Fig. 265). It is composed, therefore, of two very distinct parts—(i) a narrow anterior portion, between the true vocal cords, involving less than two-thirds of its length, and called the glottis vocalis; (2) a broader, shorter portion between the arytenoid cartilages, and termed the glottis respiratoria. The form of the rima glottidis undergoes frequent al- terations during life, but during ordinary quiet respiration it is lanceo- late in outline. The glottis vocalis presents the form of an elon- gated triangle with the base directed backwards, whilst the glottis respira- toria is somewhat quad- rangular. The length of the entire fissure differs considerably in the two sexes, as will be seen from the following figures which are given by Krause :— Length of rima glottidis in male, . 19 to 25 ni.m. ,, ,, in female, . 14 to 17 vi.iji. The side wall of the larynx in the interval between the true and the false vocal cords shows a depression or recess which is termed the laryngeal sinus. The dissector should endeavour to gauge the extent of this, by means of a probe bent at the extremity. He will note that the recess passes Fig. 265.—Transverse section through the larynx at the level of the true vocal cords. (From Luschka.) 1. Alae of thyroid cartilage. 2.

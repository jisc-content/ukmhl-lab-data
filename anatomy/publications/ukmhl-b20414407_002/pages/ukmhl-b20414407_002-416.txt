HEAD AND NECK. 386 cervical nerve enters the suboccipital triangle of the neck by passing backwards between the artery and the neural arch of the atlas. The branches which are given off by the vertebral artery in the neck are of small size. They are {a) muscular ; {b) lateral spinal. The muscular twigs go to the muscles in the neighbour- hood. The lateral spinal branches enter the spinal canal upon the cervical nerves, and have been described on p. 179. The Vertebral Vein does not take origin within the cranium. It merely accompanies the vertebral artery in the cervical part of its course, and forms a close venous plexus around it as it proceeds through the succession of bony foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. Its radicles arise in the suboccipital region, where they anastomose with the tributaries of the occipital and deep cervical veins. Before it enters the transverse process of the atlas it receives a large offset from the intra- spinal venous plexus. Inferiorly, the vertebral vein opens into the innominate vein (p. 238). Dissection.—The muscles must now be completely removed in order that the vertebral and cranio-vertebral joints, and the ligaments in con- nection with the cervical portion of the spine may be examined. The axis, atlas, and occipital bone present a series of articulations in which the uniting apparatus is very different from that of the vertebrae below. Articulations of the Lower Five Cervical Vertebrae.— The lower five cervical vertebrae are united together very much upon the same plan as the vertebrae in other regions of the vertebral column. Both the bodies and the neural arches are connected by distinct articulations and special ligaments. Three separate joints may be said to exist between the opposed surfaces of the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae— viz., a central amphiarthrodial joint and two small lateral diarthrodial joints. The amphiarthrodial joint (Fig. 249) occupies by far the

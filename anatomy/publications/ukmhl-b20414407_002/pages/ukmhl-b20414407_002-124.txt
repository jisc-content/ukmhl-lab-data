I02 HEAD AND NECK. Vertical and transverse sections must be made through two or more of the intervertebral discs, in order that their structure may be displayed. The facets of the articular processes are coated by hyaline cartilage. A capsular ligament lined by a synovial mem- brane encloses each joint. The intertransverse ligaments are feeble bands which pass between the tips of the transverse processes. In the lower part of the dorsal region they are intimately blended with the intertransverse muscles: in the middle and upper parts of the dorsal region they entirely replace the muscles. HEAD AND NECK. The dissector of the Head and Neck begins work on the same day that the subject is brought into the Dissecting- room. It is placed on a short table for this purpose, and of the two days during which it remains in the lithotomy position, the first should be devoted to the dissection of the scalp, and the second to the removal of the brain. SCALP. Strictly speaking, the term "scalp" should be restricted to the soft parts which cover the vault of the cranium above the level of the temporal ridges and the superior curved line of the occipital bone, but it is convenient to dissect at the same time the superficial structures in the temporal regions. Above the level of the temporal ridges we meet with five strata as we dissect from the surface to the bone, viz.â€” (i) the skin; (2) the superficial fascia; (3) the occipito- frontalis muscle, with its extensive epicranial aponeurosis;

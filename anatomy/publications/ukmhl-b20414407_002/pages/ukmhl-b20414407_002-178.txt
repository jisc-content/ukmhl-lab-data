HEAD AND NECK. superior oblique muscle of the head, and it is traversed by the occipital artery which in this part of its course gives off its arteria princeps cervicis branch. Next remove the vertebral aponeurosis and turn the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and the superficial lamella of the lumbar fascia outwards. Erector Spinas (sacro-spinalis).—Under this name we include a series of muscular strands which stretch with a greater or less degree of continuity along the entire length of the dorsal aspect of the spinal column. In the lumbar region it constitutes a bulky fleshy mass which may be considered the starting point. This bulky mass sends a pointed process downwards on the back of the sacrum, and has the following origin :—(i) from the spines of the lower two dorsal, all the lumbar and all the sacral vertebrae; (2) from the supra-spinous ligaments which bind the lumbar and dorsal spines together; (3) from the back of the sacrum and from the posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament; (4) from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest. In great part the super- ficial surface of this muscular mass is covered by a very dense tendon, which in its lower part becomes blended, as already noted, with the superficial lamella of the lumbar fascia. As the erector spinse is followed upwards it is seen to divide into three columns. The outer column first separates from the general mass, and to it the name of ilio-costalis is given; the middle column is termed the longissimus^ and the inner column, which only becomes quite distinct as we approach the upper part of the dorsal region, is called the spifialis dorsi. Ilio-costalis (ilio-costalis lumborum).—The intermuscular interval between this muscle and the longissimus becomes apparent about the level of the last rib. The separa- tion is rendered all the more distinct from the external branches of the posterior primary divisions of the dorsal spinal nerves appearing in the interval. Turn the muscle

Each nerve, before it reaches the surface, pierces —{a) the internal intercostal muscle; {b) the anterior intercostal membrane ; {c) the origin of the pectoralis major ; and (d) the deep fascia (Fig. 154). But this description only holds good for the upper five Fig. 154.—Diagram of one of the upper intercostal nerves. intercostal nerves. The lower six nerves^ on leaving the anterior ends of the intercostal spaces, pass forwards into the abdominal wall between the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles, where they have already been displayed by the dissector of the abdomen. The intercostal nerves, as they traverse the thoracic wall, give off—ia) the lateral cutaneous branches ; and {b) twigs to the intercostal muscles and triangularis sterni. Their

CILIARY PROCESSES. 621 radiate backwards from the circumference of the crystalline lens. By washing out the pigment from this part of the vascular tunic, the arrange- ment of the processes will be more fully displayed. A second dissection may be made in another eyeball with the object of exposing the ciliary processes from the front. In this case remove the cornea with the scissors by cutting round the corneo scleral junction. The iris is now brought conspicuously into view, and may, with advan- tage, be studied at this stage. Several cuts in the meridional direction, and at equal intervals from each other, should in the next place be made through the anterior part of the sclerotic coat. The strips of sclerotic should then be separated from the ciliary muscle, and pinned backwards in a cork-lined tray filled with water. The last step in the dissection consists in the removal of the iris. Ciliary Processes.—When the choroid coat is traced forwards under the ciliary muscle, it is seen to form a series -Proc. cil. -Lens. -Ora Sir rat a Fig. 334.-—The ciliary processes of the human eyeball viewed from behind. (From Merkel.) of elongated prominent thickenings, which radiate backwards from the margin of the crystalline lens like the folds of a goffered frill. These thickenings are the ciliary processes. They vary slightly in their degree of prominence, and also in length, but they are very constant in number. In the human eye seventy ciliary processes, as a rule, may be counted. As each process proceeds forwards, it becomes gradually more and more prominent until ultimately it ends in a thickened projection, which occupies the space between the margin of the iris and the circumferential part of the anterior surface of the crystalline lens. In this position the ciliary processes bound peripherally the pos- terior chamber of the eyeball (Fig. 331).

EXTERNAL CAPSULE. 565 into an external, internal, and an anterior nucleus (Figs. 308) by thin internal medullar}^ laminae. External Capsule.—This term is applied to the narrow- band of white matter which intervenes betvveen the lenticular nucleus and the claustrum (Figs. 303, 304, and 305). Dissection.—The bundle of Vicq D'Azyr and the anterior commissure should now be followed as far as this is possible in what remains of the rio'ht half of the cerebrum. In can neither case is the dissection a difficult one. By removing the remains of the lenticular nucleus the an- terior commissure will be ex- posed in its course towards the temporal lobe. In the first in- stance, it passes transversely outw^ards through the lower part of the globus pallidus and below the putamen. It then bends suddenly backwards to reach the medullar}' centre of the tem- poral lobe, above the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. If the dissection be successfully accomplished, the anterior com- missure wall be seen to pre- sent a twisted or rope-like appearance. The bundle of Vicq cTAzyr may be traced from the corpus mammillare upwards into the anterior nucleus of the optic thalamus by scraping away the grey matter on the side of the third ventricle. The continuity between the anterior pillar of the fornix and the corpus mammillare should at the same time be established. Within the corpus mammillare there is a small nucleus of grey matter.

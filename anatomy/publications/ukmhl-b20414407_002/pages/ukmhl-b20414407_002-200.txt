HEAD AND NECK. I70 Arachnoidea Spinalis—Fig. 200 {a).—The arachnoid resembles the dura mater in forming a loose, wide invest- ment for the spinal cord. Unlike the dura, however, it is remarkable for its great delicacy and transparency. The sac which it forms is most capacious towards its lower part, where it envelops the extremity of the cord and the collec- tion of long nerve-roots which constitute the cauda equina. Here it can be most easily demonstrated by making an incision into it, and inserting the handle of the scalpel, or, better still, by inflating the sac with air by means of a blow- FiG. 200.—Transverse section through the spinal cord and its membranes.

Above, the arachnoid mater becomes continuous at the level of the foramen magnum with the corresponding membrane which clothes the brain, whilst, laterally, it is pro- longed outwards upon the various nerve-roots, thus contri- buting to each a tubular sheath. Sub-arachnoid Space.—Fig. 200 {sa.p.).—This term is ap- plied to the wide space between the arachnoid and pia mater. It is occupied by a variable amount of cerebro-spinal fluid, and is directly continuous with the cranial sub-arachnoid

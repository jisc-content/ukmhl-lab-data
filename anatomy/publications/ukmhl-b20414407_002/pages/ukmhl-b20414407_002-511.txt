MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS. 481 dip into the sulci on the surface of the cerebrum and cerebellum. It bridges over the inequalities on the surface of the brain. It is consequently spread out in the form of a very distinct sheet over the medulla, the pons Varolii, and the hollow on the base of the brain which lies in front of the pons. The cut ends of several of the cranial nerves will be observed projecting through this sheet; whilst in front, immediately to the outer side of the optic nerve, the in- ternal carotid artery may be noticed piercing it.

It contains the subarachnoid fluid, and is broken up by a meshwork of fine filaments and trabeculae, which connects the two bounding membranes in the most intimate manner, and forms a delicate sponge-like interlace- ment between them. Where the arachnoidea passes over the summit of a cerebral convolution, and is consequently closely applied to the subjacent pia mater, the meshwork is so close and the trabeculae so short that the two membranes cannot be separated from each other. To the dissector they appear to form a single lamina. In the intervals between the VOL. II.—31

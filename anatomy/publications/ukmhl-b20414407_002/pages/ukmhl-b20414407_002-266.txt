In a great number of cases, a branch of considerable size will be observed springing from the third part of the subclavian artery. This, in all probability, will be the posterior scapular arising directly from the subclavian. It is so common an occurrence that the dissector must always be prepared to meet it. Vertebral Artery (arteria vertebralis).—This is the first branch which is given off by the subclavian. It springs from the posterior aspect of the trunk about a quarter of an inch from the inner margin of the scalenus anticus on the right side, and from the point where the vessel reaches the root of the neck on the left side. Only a small portion of its extent is seen in the present dissection. It proceeds up- wards in the interval between the longus colli and the scalenus anticus muscles, and disappears by entering the foramen transversarium of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. It is placed very deeply, and is covered in front by its companion vein and the internal jugular vein. Numerous large sympathetic twigs accompany it. The vertebral artery on the left side is crossed by the thoracic duct. The vertebral vein will be noticed issuing from the aperture in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. It passes downwards in front of its companion artery, and behind the internal jugular vein, to open into From the first part. From the seco7id part.

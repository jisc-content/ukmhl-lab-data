525 THE CEREBRUM. closely to each other at the locus perforatus anticus. These extremities have been seen to be connected by the roots of the olfactory tract, and in this manner the limbic ring may be considered to be closed. The upper part of the limbic lobe is placed in intimate relation to the extremities and upper surface of the corpus callosum, and receives the name of callosal convolution or gyrus fornicatus. The lower portion of the lobe, termed the hippocainpal convolution, forms the inner part of the tentorial face of the hemisphere. Behind, the hippocampal gyrus is connected with the callosal convolution by a narrow portion termed the isthmus. From this it extends forwards towards the temporal pole. Finally, on the side of the crus cerebri, the hippocampal convolution is folded back on itself, and ends in a recurved hook-like extremity, termed the uncus. The uncus does not reach so far forwards as the temporal pole. The callosal convolution begins below the anterior end of the corpus callosum at the locus perforatus anticus, and winding round the genu of the callosum, it is continued backwards on its upper surface to the hinder thickened extremity or splenium. Finally, curving round this it becomes greatly narrowed through the calcarine fissure cutting into it. This narrow part is termed the isthmus, and constitutes the link of connection between the callosal gyrus and the hippocampal gyrus. The callosal gyrus is separated from the marginal con- volution by the calloso-marginal fissure. Behind this it is very imperfectly marked off from the precuneus by the post-limbic sulcus. From the corpus callosum it is separated by the callosal sulcus. The hippocampal convolution is bounded on the outer side by the anterior part of the collateral sulcus, and in front of this by the incisura temporalis, which separates its hooked extremity, or uncus, from the temporal pole. On its inner side it is limited by the hippocampal or dentate fissure,

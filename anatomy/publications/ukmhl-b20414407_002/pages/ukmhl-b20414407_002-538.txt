THE BRAIN. 5o8 understood that they are directly continuous with each other around the supero-mesial margin of the hemisphere. The externalparieto-occipitalfissure cuts the supero-mesial border of the hemisphere in a transverse direction from one and a half to two inches in front of the occipital pole. It is usually not more than half-an-inch in length, and it is brought to an abrupt termination by an arching convolution which winds round its extremity, and receives the convenient name of arcusparieto-occipitalis (Fig. 283). The internal parieto-occipital fissure (Fig. 284,is carried downwards in a nearly vertical direction as a con- Ro.m.

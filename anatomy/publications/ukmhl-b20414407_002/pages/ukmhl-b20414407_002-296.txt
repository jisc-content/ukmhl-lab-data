266 HEAD AND NECK. the auriculo-temporal nerve, which ascends under cover of the upper part of its posterior border. The communicating twigs from the auriculo-temporal and great auricular nerves to the facial nerve, must be preserved. By this dissection the termination of the external carotid artery and the temporo-maxillary vein will be displayed. The Parotid Gland is the largest of the salivary glands. It is lodged in the niche between the lower jaw and the ear, and being adapted to this recess, it presents a very irregular figure. Above, it is limited by the zygoma. Below, Fig. 222. (From Gegenbaur.) its lower border is in apposition with the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and is separated from the submaxillary gland by that partition of the deep cervical fascia which the student has already studied under the name of the stylo- maxillary ligament. Behind it abuts against the^-auditory meatus, the mastoid process, and the sterno-mastoid muscle. In front it will be seen to overlap the posterior border of the masseter, and extend forwards upon it for some distance

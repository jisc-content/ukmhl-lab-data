THE BRAIN. 498 column behind the attachment of the ligamentum denti- culatum. The Auditory and Facial Nerves issue close together at the lower border of the pons Varolii, and immediately above the restiform body. The auditory ?ierve is the larger of the two, and lies to the outer side of the facial. Its two roots embrace the restiform body. The facial nerve issues from the pons close to its lower border, and immediately to the inner side of the auditory nerve. Between these two nerves a slender filament will be observed. This is the pars intermedia of Wrisberg. It joins the facial in the internal auditory meatus. The Abducent is a small nerve, which emerges from the front of the medulla in the groove between the lower border of the pons Varolii and the outer part of the anterior pyramid. The Trigeminal or Fifth is the largest of all the cranial nerves. It appears on the side of the pons Varolii, nearer its upper than its lower border, and in a line with the facial and auditory nerves. It consists of two roots—a large sensory root composed of a great number of fasciculi loosely held together, and a very small, more compact motor root which emerges in front and slightly to the inner side of the point at which the sensory root enters the pons. Trochlear Nerve.—The superficial origin of the trochlear or fourth nerve cannot be seen at present. It emerges from the valve of Vieussens. It is a delicate little nerve which has a long intracranial course, and may be observed winding round the outer side of the crus cerebri, between the cere- brum and cerebellum. The Oculomotor Nerve may be seen within the inter- peduncular space. It issues by several fascicles from the sulcus oculomotorius on the inner face of the crus cerebri. The Optic is a large round nerve which proceeds outwards and forwards from the optic tract and optic chiasma. The origin of the optic tract will be studied at a later stage.

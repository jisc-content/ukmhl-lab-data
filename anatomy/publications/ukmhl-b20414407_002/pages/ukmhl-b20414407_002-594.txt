562 THE BRAIN. The nucleus lenticularis comes to the surface at the anterior perforated spot, and a continuity between the grey matter forming it and the grey cortex of the brain is thus estabhshed. The Claustrum is a thin plate of grey substance em- bedded in the white matter which intervenes between the lenticular nucleus and the grey cortex of the island of Reil. caudate nucleus corpus callosum fornix internal capsule optic thalamus middle commissure external capsule claustrum Fig. 305.â€”Coronal section through the corpus striatum in a plane posterior to the section exhibited in Figure 304.

Followed in an upward direction it becomes gradually thinner until it ultimately appears, when seen in section, as an exceedingly delicate grey streak. As it is traced down- wards, however, it thickens considerably, and at the base of the brain it comes to the surface at the anterior perforated spot, and becomes continuous with the grey matter of the

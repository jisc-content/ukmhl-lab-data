134 HEAD AND NECK. branch ascends upon the great wing of the sphenoid, and the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, grooving both deeply, whilst the posterior branch turns backwards upon the squamous portion of the temporal bone. The wide distribution of these vessels in the dura mater has already been noticed. Two veins accompany the middle meningeal artery. Above, these vessels communicate with the superior longi- tudinal sinus (Testut), whilst below, they unite in a common trunk which joins the pterygoid plexus. The anterior rfieningeal artery (arteria meningea anterior) proceeds from the anterior ethmoidal artery as it lies on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, along with the nasal nerve. It supplies a limited area of dura mater in the anterior fossa of the cranium. The small meningeal artery (ramus meningeus accessorius) is somewhat inconstant, and not unfrequently springs from the middle meningeal. It enters the cranium through the foramen ovale, but it should not be looked for at the present stage, as it is best examined along with the Gasserian ganglion and the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The meningeal branches from the ascending pharyngeal artery are the terminal twigs of this vessel, and enter the cranium through the foramen lacerum medium, through the jugular foramen, and through the anterior condyloid foramen. The branch which passes through the jugular foramen is the largest. The meningeal branches of the occipital and vertebral arteries are small. The former enters through the jugular foramen, whilst the latter gains admittance to the cranium through the foramen magnum, and is distributed in the posterior cranial fossa. Pituitary "^o^-^ {hypophysis cerebri)—Fig. 195.—The over- hanging margin of the diaphragma sellae should be freely cut in two or three places, and the pituitary body carefully dislodged from the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone.

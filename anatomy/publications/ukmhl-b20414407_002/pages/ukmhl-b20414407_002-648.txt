6i6 THE EYEBALL. wards, some resistance will be met close to the margin of the cornea from the attachment of the ciliary muscle to the deep surface of the sclerotic. This can easily be broken through with the blunt point of the closed forceps ; as soon as this is done the aqueous humour escapes. In the case of the posterior part of the sclerotic, its complete separation can be effected by dividing the fibres of the optic nerve close to the point where they appear through the sclerotic. When the above dissection is successfully carried out, the outer fibrous tunic is isolated in two portions, whilst a continuous view of the inter- mediate vascular coat is obtained. The eyeball, denuded of its external tunic, should now be placed in a shallow vessel filled with water. Sclerotic Coat.—The sclerotic is what is commonly known as the white of the eye. It is a dense, resistant Fig. 332.—Posterior aspect of left eyeball. (After Testut, modified.) tunic, opaque-white in colour, which envelopes the posterior five-sixths of the globe of the eye. It is thickest behind, and becomes thinner as it is traced forwards. Near the cornea, however, it again becomes thicker owing to the accession of fibres which it receives from the tendons of the ocular muscles. Except at the optic entrance and close to the margin of the cornea, where it adheres to the surface of the subjacent ciliary muscle, the deep surface of the sclerotic is very loosely attached to the choroid coat. Some pigmented fiocculent connective tissue, termed the

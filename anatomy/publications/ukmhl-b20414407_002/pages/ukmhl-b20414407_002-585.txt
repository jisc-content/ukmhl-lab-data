THE MESEXCEPHALON. which this name is appHed are for the most part composed of grey matter, although each has a superficial coating of white fibres. The superior pair are larger and broader than the inferior pair, but they are not so well defined nor yet so prominent. A longitudinal and a transverse groove separate the quadrigeminal bodies from each other. The longitudinal groove occupies the mesial plane, and extends upwards as far as the posterior commissure. From its lower end a short but well defined narrow band of white fibres, the frce-nulu?n veli, passes to the valve of Vieussens—a lamina placed immediately below the inferior pair of quadrigeminal pro- minences. The upper part of the longitudinal groove is occupied by the pineal body. The transverse groove curves round behind each of the superior pair of quadrigeminal bodies, and separates them from the inferior pair. Brachia of the Corpora Quadrigemina.—-The corpora quadrigemina are not marked off from the side of the mesen- cephalon, but each body has in connection with it on this aspect a prominent white strand, which is prolonged upwards and forwards under the projecting puhinar and corpus geniculatum externum on the hinder end of the optic thalamus. These strands are called the brachia of the corpora quadrigemina, and they are separated from each other by a continuation on the side of the mesencephalon of the transverse groove which intervenes between the two pairs of bodies. Corpus Geniculatuin Intemimi.—Closely connected with the brachia of the corpora quadrigemina will be seen the corpus geniculatum internum. It is a little oval eminence, ver}- sharply defined, which lies on the side of the upper part of the mesencephalon under shelter of the pulvinar of the optic thalamus. Connections of the Brachia and the Origin of the Optic Tract.—It will now be seen that the brachia are intimately connected with the optic tract. The i?iferior brachium pro-

HEAD AND NECK. 370 springs from its lower and fore angle. The lower group is generally more numerous than the upper. As these fine nerves proceed along the optic nerve they divide, and thus increase in number; at the back of the eyeball from twelve to eighteen may be counted. Finally they pierce the sclerotic by a series of apertures which are placed around the entrance of the optic nerve. The Ophthalmic Artery (arteria ophthalmica) is a branch of the internal carotid, and it accompanies the optic nerve into the orbit through the optic foramen. At first it Hes below the optic nerve, but it soon winds round the outer side of the nerve, and crossing it superficially proceeds forwards along the inner wall of the orbit, under cover of the superior oblique muscle. At the inner angle of the orbit, it ends by dividing into two terminal branches—viz.. the frontal and the nasal (Fig. 244). The branches of the ophthalmic artery are very numerous, and they can seldom be satisfactorily displayed, unless a special injection has been made, or a cold injection used. They are :— 1. The lachrymal. 6. Ethmoidal. 2. Muscular. 7. Palpebral. 3. Arteria retinae centralis. 8. Xasal. 4. Ciliary. 9. Frontal. 5. Supra-orbital. The lachrymal artery (arteria lacrimalis) accompanies the lachrymal nerve, and supplies the gland of that name and the conjunctiva. Two branches, named exter?ml palpebral (arteriae palpebrales laterales), form an arch (arcus tarseus) in each eyelid, near the free margin, with the internal palpebral arteries. The muscular twigs (rami musculares) come off at variable points, not only from the main artery, but also from certain of its branches. They supply the muscles contained in the orbital cavity. The arteria retina centralis is a minute but important

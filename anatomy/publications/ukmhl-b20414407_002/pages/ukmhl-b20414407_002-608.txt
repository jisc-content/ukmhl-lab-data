THE BRAIN. 576 white matter and open towards the mesial plane. It is in reality a lamina arranged in a purse-like manner with its open mouth directed towards the raphe. The fibres which enter through its mouth constitute the olivary pedtmcle. The accessory olivary nuclei are two band-like laminte of grey matter, which are respectively placed on the dorsal and mesial aspects of the main nucleus, ^\^len seen in transverse section each of these nuclei presents a rod-like appearance (Fig. 312, 6^ and cr.) Behind, or deeper than, the olive on the one hand, and the pyramid on the other, is the fonnatio retictilaris of the medulla. It forms a large n.X f 71.x Fig. 312.—Section through the medulla oblongata at the leve of the middle part of the olive.

384 HEAD AND NECK. Intertransverse Muscles and Cervical Nerves.—To obtain a proper display of the intertransverse muscles it will be necessary to remove the prevertebral and scalene muscles. The intertransverse muscles consist of seven pairs of small fleshy slips, on each side, which connect the bifid extremities of the cervical transverse processes (Fig. 248, 3). The anterior slip of each muscle is attached to the anterior tubercles of two adjacent transverse processes; whilst the posterior slip ex- tends between the posterior tubercles. The highest pair of muscular slips lies between the atlas and the axis; the lowest pair connects the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra with the transverse pro- cess of the first dorsal vertebra. The cervical nerves will be observed to have a very definite relation to the intertransverse muscles. The anterior primary branches of the lower six cer- vical nerves make their appear- ance by passing outwards be- tween the two slips of the corresponding muscles. The posterior primary divisions of the same nerves turn back- wards behind the posterior muscular slips. The upper two cervical nerves emerge from the spinal canal, as we have already noticed, differently from , the others. They pass backwards over the neural arches, of the atlas and axis respectively.

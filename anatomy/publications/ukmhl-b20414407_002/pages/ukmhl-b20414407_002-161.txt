REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 133 sinus. Owing to its position, this sinus is somewhat difficult to demonstrate. Arteries entering the Cranial Cavity.—The student has now examined the various channels by means of which the venous blood is drained out of the cranial cavity. He should next examine the arteries which introduce the blood into this cavity. These are— 1. The vertebral arteries. 2. The internal carotid arteries. 3. The meningeal arteries. The Vertebral and Internal Carotid Arteries carry blood for the supply of the encephalon and the parts within the orbit. The internal carotid artery will be observed piercing the dura mater immediately behind, and to the inner side of the anterior clinoid process. At this point it gives off its ophthalmic branch which accompanies the optic nerve through the optic foramen, and immediately beyond this the internal carotid trunk has been severed in the removal of the brain. The vertebral artery will be observed piercing the dura mater immediately below the foramen magnum. It also has been divided close to its point of entrance. Meningeal Arteries.—These are the nutrient arteries of the dura mater, and the inner table and diploe of the cranial bones. They are derived from a great number of different sources, but the only one of any size is the middle meningeal^ which comes from the internal maxillary artery. The others are small twigs, and, except in a well injected subject, will not be easily made out. They are:—(i) anterior meningeal from the anterior ethmoidal artery; (2) the small meningeal from the internal maxillary artery; (3) some small branches from the ascending pharyngeal, occipital, and vertebral arteries. The middle meningeal artery (arteria meningea media), a branch of the internal maxillary artery, enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid, and divides into two large terminal branches. Of these, the anterior

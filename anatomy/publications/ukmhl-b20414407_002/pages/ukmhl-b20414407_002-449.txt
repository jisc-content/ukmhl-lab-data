SUPERIOR DENTAL NERVES. 419 Superior Maxillary Nerve.—The superior maxillary nerve springs from the Gasserian ganglion within the cranial cavity (p. 355). It is composed entirely of sensory fibres, and proceeds forwards under the dura mater to the foramen rotundum through which it passes into the spheno- maxillary fossa. The nerve is now carried across the upper part of this fossa and enters the infra-orbital canal, where it receives the name of infra-orbital. Finally it emerges upon the face through the infra-orbital foramen, and breaks up, under cover of the levator labii superioris, into numerous branches, which form a dense plexus with twigs from the facial nerve. Its terminal filaments are distributed to the lower eyelid, the nose, and the upper lip. From its origin within the cranium to its termination on the face, the superior maxillary nerve pursues a nearly straight course, and in each stage it gives off one or more branches. These are:— 1.

I Labial, J The temporo-malar nerve., which has already been dissected in the orbit, can now be traced back to its origin from the superior maxillary nerve in the spheno-maxillary fossa. The spheno-palatine branches are two stout twigs which arise from the under aspect of the superior maxillary nerve, and proceed vertically downwards in the spheno-maxillary fossa to Meckel's ganglion, of which they constitute the se?isory roots. Superior Dental Nerves (nervi alveolares superiores).— These are usually three in number, and are distinguished as posterior, middle, and anterior. The middle superior dental nerve is sometimes absent as a separate trunk, in

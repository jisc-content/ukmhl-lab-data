DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 295 The tarsi are two thin plates of condensed connective tissue placed one in each eyelid, so as to occupy an area immediately adjoining its free margin. They differ very materially from each other. The superior tarsal plate is much the larger of the two, and presents the figure of a half oval. Its deep surface is intimately connected with the subjacent conjunctiva, whilst its superficial surface is clothed by the orbicularis, and is in relation to the roots of the eyelashes. Its superior border is thin, convex, and continuous with the tendinous expansion of the levator palpebrae superioris. The inferior border of the tarsal plate is thickened and straight, and the integument adheres firmly to it. The inferior tarsal plate is a narrow strip which is similarly placed in the lower lid. Meibomian Follicles.â€”At this stage the attention of the student cannot fail to be attracted by the Meibomian follicles. To the naked eye they appear as closely-placed, parallel, yellow, granular-looking streaks, which run at right angles to the free margins of the lids. They are more numerous and of greater length in the upper lid, and, being lodged in furrows on the deep surface of the tarsal plates, they are distinctly visible upon both aspects of these, even while the conjunctiva is in position. The ducts open upon the free margin of each lid behind the eyelashes, and by the aid of a magnifying glass they can be seen as round orifices placed in a single row. The mouths of these glands can be well demonstrated by squeezing the eyeHd between the finger and thumb, when the greasy secretion of the glands will be pressed out. The Palpebral Ligaments are two broad membranous sheets which extend into the basal portions of the eyelids from the upper and lower margins of the orbital opening. They form an incomplete membranous diaphragm around the circumferential part of the orbital opening, termed the

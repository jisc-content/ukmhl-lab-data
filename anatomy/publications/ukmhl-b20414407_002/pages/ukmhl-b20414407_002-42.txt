20 THORAX. runs inwards and backwards along the eleventh rib, and reaches the spine at the level of the neck of the twelfth rib. Trace now the line along which the left pleura is reflected from the chest wall below the level of the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage. At this point it retires in an out- ward direction from the right pleura, and descends at a variable distance from it, so as to leave a small triangular Fig. i6o.â€”The pleural reflection on each side is repre- sented by a solid black line. The outline of the lung is indicated by a dotted line. (From Gegenbaur.) portion of the pericardium uncovered by pleura, and in direct contact with the anterior chest wall. This area is very variable in its extent, but the accompanying diagram (Fig. 160) may be considered to represent the maximum amount of outward deviation of the left pleural sac in con- nection with this part of the chest wall. As a rule, the area of the pericardium which is left bare is not so extensive. Incisura cardiaca.

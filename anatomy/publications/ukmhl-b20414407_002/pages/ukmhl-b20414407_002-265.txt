SIDE OF THE NECK. 235 The relations of the subclavian artery are so numerous, and of so varied a character, at different parts of its extent, that it is found necessary to subdivide it into three portions. The first part extends from the origin of the vessel to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus ; the secoftdportion lies behind this muscle; whilst the third part extends from the Fig. 216.—Diagram of the subclavian artery and its branches.

First part.—Owing to the difference of origin, the rela- tions presented by the first portion of the subclavian artery are not the same on the two sides of the body. Let us examine, in the first instance, the vessel of the right side.

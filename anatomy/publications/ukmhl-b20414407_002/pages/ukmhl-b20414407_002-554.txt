THE BRAIN. 524 Olfactory Lobe.—The olfactory lobe is small and rudi- mentary in the human brain. It is described by His as consisting of a posterior lobule, which may be said to correspond with that part of the cerebral cortex which is named the locus perforatus anticus, and an anterior lobule composed of (i ) the olfactory bulb and tract, with the two roots of the latter; (2) the trigonum olfactorium ; and (3) the area of Broca. The olfactory tract is a narrow white prismatic band, which expands anteriorly into a swollen bulbous extremity termed the olfactory bulb. Both the tract and the bulb lie upon the olfactory sulcus on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, whilst the inferior surface of the bulb rests on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and receives the numerous olfactory nerves which reach it through the foramina in that part of the cranial floor. Posteriorly, the olfactory tract will be seen to divide into two diverging roots of attachment. The mesial root curves abruptly inwards, and may be followed into the extremity of the callosal gyrus {i.e., the anterior end of the limbic lobe). The lateral root runs backwards and outwards over the outer part of the locus perforatus anticus, and gradually dis- appears from view. In animals in which the olfactory apparatus is better developed than in man, it may be traced into the uncinate extremity of the hippocampal convolution {i.e., posterior end of the limbic lobe). The trigonu7n olfactorium is the little triangular field of grey matter which occupies the interval between the roots of the olfactory tract at the point where they begin to diverge. The area of Broca lies in front of the curved mesial root of the olfactory tract, and is continuous with the commence- ment of the callosal gyrus. Limbic or Falciform Lobe.—This lobe is seen on the mesial surface of the hemisphere, in the form of an elongated ring-like convolution, the extremities of which approach

HEAD AND NECK. 158 of a spinal nerve, and with it is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back. In the lumbar region similar branches are derived from the lumbar arteries. They are distributed upon the same plan. In both dorsal and lumbar regions these vessels, before reaching the back, furnish small spinal branches which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina. These will be traced at a later period. The accompanying veins of the dorsal branches of the lumbar and intercostal arteries pour their blood into the lumbar and intercostal veins. These veins are of large size, being joined by tributaries from the dorsal spinal venous plexus, and also by others from the interior of the spinal canal. Transversus Spinalis.—Under this name are included a system of muscles which occupy the vertebral groove from the back of the sacrum as high as the axis vertebra. When this muscular mass is analysed, it is found to consist of three strata, each of which is composed of a series of bundles or slips pursuing a more or less obhque course. As the term given to the whole system implies, these slips for the most part stretch from the transverse processes upwards and inwards to be inserted into the spinous processes of the vertebrae. The superficial slips pass over five or more vertebras and connect distant points on the column; the deeper slips are shorter, and the most deeply placed of all merely pass between contiguous vertebrae. The superficial layer is termed the semispinalis muscle; the intermediate layer is called the multifidus spince ; whilst the deep stratum is composed of a series of short muscles, termed the rotatores spince. In the dorsal and cervical regions we find the three layers (Hughes); in the lumbar and sacral regions the semispinalis is absent. Dissection.—The semispinalis muscle is already in great part ex- posed. To display it fully, however, it is necessary to remove the spinalis dorsi muscle.

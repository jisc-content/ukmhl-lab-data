HEAD AND NECK. 240 nerve to the larynx. The tracheal (rami tracheales) and (Esophageal (rami oesophagei) branches in like manner supply the trachea and gullet. They are of small size, and anasto- mose with the bronchial and oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. The thyroid or terminal branches (rami glandulares) are usually two in number. One ascends upon the posterior aspect of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, whilst the other is given to its base or lower end. They inosculate with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side, and also with the branches of the superior thyroid artery. The muscular branches are a series of irregular twigs given to the various muscles in the neighbour- hood. The iftferior thyroid vein does not run in company with the artery of the same name. It is a large vessel which comes from the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, and descends upon the trachea under cover of the sterno-thyroid muscle. The veins of both sides enter the thorax, and unite to form a short common stem, which opens into the left innominate trunk. In many cases, however, the right vein will be observed to open separately into the angle of union between the two innominate veins. Both veins receive, as they proceed down, tributaries from the larynx, trachea, and oesophagus. The anterior vertebral vein accompanies the ascending cervical artery, and opens into the vertebral vein. The Suprascapular and Transversalis Colli Arteries have already been examined in the greater part of their course (p. 206). After taking origin from the thyroid axis, they both pass outwards upon the scalenus anticus muscle, and under cover of the clavicular head of the sterno-mastoid. The suprascapular (arteria transversa scapulae) crosses the scalene muscle close to its insertion, immediately above the subclavian vein; the transversalis colli (arteria transversa colli) is placed at a slightly higher level. Both vessels cross in front of the phrenic nerve.

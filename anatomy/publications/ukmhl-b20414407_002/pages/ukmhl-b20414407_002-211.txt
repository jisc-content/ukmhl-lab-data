DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. i8i Preservation of the Spinal Cord.—If the spinal cord be in a fit state for preservation, the dissector should immerse it for a few weeks in methy- lated spirit, or in a large quantity of a saturated solution of bichromate of potash. When sufficiently firm, the dissector should endeavour to learn something of its internal structure by making transverse sections through it at different levels, and inspecting the cut surface closely with the naked eye, or with the aid of a magnifying glass. Internal Structure of the Spinal Cord.—A good deal can be learned by a naked eye inspection of cross sections of the cord made in different regions and at different levels. The spinal cord is then seen to be a bilateral structure. It is partially subdivided into a right and a left half by two median clefts,—one upon the anterior, and the other upon the posterior aspect. These clefts are called the antero-inedia?! and the postero- median fissures., and they extend along the entire length of the cord. At the same time, it must be noted that these two median fissures present many points of difference. The antero-median fissure is, for the greater part of its length, much shallower than the postero-median fissure; further, it is wider and much more apparent, and the pia mater dips down into it to form a fold or reduplication within it. The postero-median cleft, in addition to its being deeper and narrower, contains only a single septum of pia mater prolonged into it from the deep surface of the enclosing membrane. The two halves of the cord thus marked off from each other are to all intents and purposes symmetrical, and they Fig. 204. — Segment of spinal cord ; lateral aspect.

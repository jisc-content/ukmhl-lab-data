453 THE LARYNX. The Thyro-hyoid Membrane is a broad membranous sheet, which occupies the interval between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage. It is not equally strong throughout, but shows a central thick portion and a cord-like right and left margin, whilst in the intervals between these it is thin and weak. The central thickened part {ligamentum thyro- hyoideum medium) is largely composed of elastic fibres. Above, it is attached to the posterior aspect of the upper margin of the body of the hyoid bone, whilst below, it is Fig. 266.â€”(From Gegenbaur.) fixed to the sides of the deep median notch, which interrupts the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. The upper part of its anterior surface is therefore placed behind the posterior hollowed out surface of the body of the hyoid bone; a synovial bursa is interposed between them, and in certain movements of the head and larynx the upper border of the thyroid cartilage is allowed to slip upw^ards behind the hyoid bone. On each side of the strong central part the

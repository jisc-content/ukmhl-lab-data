SIDE OF THE NECK. 255 breaking up into twigs, which enter the substance of the thyroid body. The following branches proceed from it :â€” 3. Sterno-mastoid. The hyoid (ramus hyoideus) is a minute twig, which springs from the superior thyroid before it leaves the carotid triangle, and runs transversely inwards under cover of the thyro-hyoid muscle, and along the lower border of the hyoid bone. It anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the hyoid branch of the lingual artery. The superior lary?igeal artery (arteria laryngea superior) is a larger vessel. It springs from the superior thyroid as it lies in the carotid triangle, and associating itself with the internal laryngeal nerve, it enters the larynx by piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane. The sterno-mastoid artery (arteria sternocliedomastoidea) is a small vessel which runs downwards and outwards across the carotid sheath, to reach the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid muscle, into which it sinks. It gives, in addition, minute twigs to the depressor muscles of the larynx, and its only claim to special description is the position it occupies in relation to the common carotid artery. The crico-thyroid artery (ramus cricothyreoideus) runs inwards upon the crico-thyroid membrane, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side. It has already been noticed, in the dissection of the middle line of the neck (p. 222). The thyroid or terjuinal branches (rami glandulares) of the superior thyroid artery spring from the main trunk at the apex of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body. Three main branches may be recognised ; of these the largest is distributed on the posterior surface of the lateral lobe ; the smallest ramifies on its outer surface ; whilst the third is carried downwards upon the inner aspect of the lateral lobe, and then along 1.

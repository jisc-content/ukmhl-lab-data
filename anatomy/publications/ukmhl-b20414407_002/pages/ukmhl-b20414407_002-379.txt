DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 349 From its upper end the stout branch proceeds which enters the carotid canal, whilst its lower end tapers into the down- ward continuation of the cord. Numerous branches issue from it; of these some connect it with neighbouring nerves, whilst others are distributed in various ways. The connecting branches are: — (i) slender filaments which connect it with the upper four cervical nerves; (2) twigs to both ganglia of the vagus ; (3) to the petrous gang- lion of the glosso-pharyngeal; and (4) to the hypoglossal. It is not connected with the spinal accessory. The branches of distribution are :— 1. Rami vasculares. 2. Pharyngeal. 3. Superior cardiac. The rami vasculares are soft delicate filaments which run towards the external carotid artery, and form a loose interlacement around it and its branches. From this plexus a branch is given to the intercarotid body; further, the part continued upon the facial artery supplies, as we have already noted, the sympathetic root to the submaxillary ganglion, whilst the subdivision upon the middle meningeal artery furnishes the corresponding root to the otic ganglion, as well as the external superficial petrosal nerve which runs to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The phary?igeal branches course inwards between the two carotid arteries to join the pharyngeal plexus. The superior cardiac nerve is a long slender branch which springs by several roots from the ganglion and then pro- ceeds downwards behind the carotid artery. At different stages of its course it is joined by other branches of the sympathetic, by a branch from the vagus, and also by filaments from the external laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The right superior cardiac nerve is continued into the thorax by passing behind or in front of the subclavian artery, and it ends in the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve follows the left common carotid artery

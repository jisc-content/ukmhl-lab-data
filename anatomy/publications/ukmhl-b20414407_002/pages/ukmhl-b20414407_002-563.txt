THE CEREBRUM. 531 this there is a low-lying but distinct ridge, formed by a slender white tract of nerve fibres, called the stria longiiudi- nalis fnedialis. Again, to the outer side of this, and under cover of the callosal gyrus, there are other feebly marked longitudinal ridges, termed the strice longitudinales laterales. The two extremities of the corpus callosum (Fig. 291) are greatly thickened, whilst the intermediate part, often called the body, is considerably thinner.

The anterior end, which is not quite so massive, is folded downwards and backwards upon itself, and is called the genu. The recurved lower portion of the genu is separated from the part of the corpus callosum which lies above by an interval; it rapidly thins as it passes backwards, and is termed the rostrum.

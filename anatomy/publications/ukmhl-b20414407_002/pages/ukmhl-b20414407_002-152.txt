HEAD AND NECK. 126 The Diaphragma Sellse is a small circular fold of the inner layer of the dura mater which forms a roof for the sella turcica. A small opening is left in its centre for the trans- mission of the infundibulum. An almost complete case is thus formed for the pit- uitary body. Cranial Nerves.—The dissector should now turn his attention to the cranial nerves, and study the manner in which they leave the cranial cavity. Each nerve car- ries out with it a covering derived from each of the three membranes of the brain. In the case of the optic nerve these remain distinct; but in all the others the sheath derived from the arach- noid very soon disap- pears. Begin by examining the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. From this the olfactory bulb has been displaced in the removal of the brain. About twenty minute Fig 193.—Aperture between the dor- sum sell£e and the anterior con- cave free margin of the tentorium.

Anterior clinoid process. olfactory nerves proceed from the under surface of the bulb and descend into the nose through the holes in the cribriform plate. These have been ruptured close to their origin, but in all probability traces of them will be observed. The second or optic nerve—Fig. 193 (3)—will be seen enter- ing the orbit through the optic foramen. It is accompanied

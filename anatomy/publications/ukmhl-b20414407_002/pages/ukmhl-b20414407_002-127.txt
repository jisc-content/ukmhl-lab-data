SCALP. proceed downwards upon the nasal bone to form the pyramidahs nasi muscle. Ascending upon the forehead, the frontal bellies are inserted near the line of the coronal suture into the epicranial aponeurosis. The Epicranial Aponeurosis {galea aponeuroticd) which connects the occipital and frontal bellies of the occipito- frontalis muscle, constitutes a continuous layer over the summit and sides of the head. Posteriorly it can be traced backwards in the interval between the two occipital bellies of the muscle, when it will be observed to have an attach- ment to the external occipital protuberance and the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Laterally, it presents no sharply defined margin, but, losing its aponeurotic character, it is prolonged downwards as a fine expansion over the temporal fascia. In this locality it gives origin to tw© of the small auricular muscles. Dissection.—Divide the epicranial aponeurosis by a mesial incision of about an inch and a-half in length, and then carry across the middle of this a second short transverse cut. On raising the corners thus marked out, the aponeurosis will be seen to rest upon a layer of loose flocculent areolar tissue, containing no fat—the fourth stratum of the scalp. Owing to the great laxity of this tissue, the occipito-frontalis muscle by its con- tractions can move the hairy scalp freely over the pericranium which invests the bone. Extrinsic Muscles of the Ear.—In man these muscles are very poorly developed, and the auricle possesses in conse- quence only a very limited power of independent movement. They are three in number, viz. :— 1. Attollens auriculam. 2. Attrahens auriculam. 3. Retrahens auriculam. The first two of these are so thin that it requires an ex- perienced and careful dissector to isolate them from the superficial fascia. Attollens auriculam—Fig. 186 (i).—To expose this muscle the upper part of the auricle must be dragged downwards.

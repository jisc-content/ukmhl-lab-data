On the exterior of the heart there are markings which indicate this internal subdivision, and enable us to map out with the greatest accuracy the walls of the four cham- bers. Thus encircling the heart in transverse direction, nearer the base than the apex, is a deep furrow which is Fig. 167.â€”Posterior surface (fades diaphragi7iatica) of the heart. (From Gegenbaur.)

It in- tervenes between the auricles which lie above it and the ventricles which are placed below it. In the undissected heart, with the epicardium in position, the depth of this furrow is somewhat obscured, from the fact that it lodges some large blood vessels and a certain amount of fat.

THE CEREBRUM. 503 features the same in all human brains; but when the com- parison is pushed into the more minute details of the arrangement many differences become manifest, not only in the brains of different individuals, but also in the two cerebral hemispheres of one individual. Of the furrows we have to recognise two varieties, viz., complete and incomplete. The coi?iplete fissures are few in number, and they consist of inwardly directed folds which involve the whole thickness of the cerebral wall. They consequently show in the interior of the cerebral cavity or lateral ventricle in the form of internal elevations on its wall. In this category we include (i) the dentate or hippo- campal fissure; (2) the anterior portion of the calcarine fissure; and (3) a portion of the collateral fissure. The incomplete sulci are merely surface furrows of very varying depth which do not produce any effect on the inner surface of the ventricular wall. General Structure of the Cerebral Hemispheres.â€”Each cerebral hemisphere is composed of an outside coating of grey matter spread in a continuous and uninterrupted layer over its entire surface, except where the corpus callosum enters, and an internal core of white matter. The grey coating is termed the cerebral cortex., whilst the white in- ternal part is called the medullary centre. But in addition to the grey matter on the outside, there are certain large deposits of grey matter embedded in the substance of each hemisphere in its basal part. These constitute the cerebral nuclei., and although to a certain extent isolated from the grey matter on the surface, it will be observed later on that at certain points they are directly continuous with it. Each convolution shows a corresponding structure. It has an external covering of grey matter supported upon a core of white medullary matter. By means of the convolutions and sulci the grey matter on the surface of the hemisphere is enormously increased.

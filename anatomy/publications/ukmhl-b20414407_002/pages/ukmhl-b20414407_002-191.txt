DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. i6i from the tip of the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and, expanding as it proceeds downwards and out- wards, is inserted into the outer border of the first rib, imme- diately beyond the tubercle. Each of the succeeding muscles takes origin from the tip of a dorsal transverse process, and is inserted into the outer surface of the rib immediately below, along a line extending from the tubercle to the angle. Posterior Primary Divisions of the Sacral Nerves.— These are very small. The upper four will be found emerg- ing from the posterior sacral foramina ; the fifth appears at the lower end of the sacral canal. To expose the upper three the multifidus spinae muscle covering the upper three sacral apertures must be carefully removed. Each of these three nerves will be found to divide in the usual manner into an internal and external branch. The internal bra?iches are very fine, and end in the multifidus spinae. The external bra?iclies are somewhat larger, and join together so as to form a looped plexus upon the back of the sacrum. This communicates above with the external branch of the last lumbar nerve and below with the posterior division of the fourth sacral nerve. Branches proceed from the loops thus formed to the surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. Finally they become superficial by piercing the gluteus maximus muscle, and they supply a limited area of skin over the gluteal region. They have already been examined by the dissector of the lower Hmb. The lowest two posterior primary divisions of the sacral nerves do not exhibit the usual division into external and internal branches. They are very small, and, after com- municating with each other, and also with the coccygeal ?terve, they distribute filaments to the parts on the back of the lower portion of the sacrum and on the dorsal aspect of the coccyx.

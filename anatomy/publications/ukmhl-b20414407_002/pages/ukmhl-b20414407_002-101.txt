It issues from this plexus in the form of one or two cords, which pass to the anterior aspect of the aright vagus nerve. left vagus left recurrent laryn- geal nerve posterior left pul- monary plexus left bronchus left pulmonary vein right recurrent laryngeal nerve. vena azygos major. vena cava inferior. diaphragm.

Upon the oesophagus another plexus—the plexus gulcE—is formed. Both of the pneumogastric nerves take part in the formation of this plexus. From the plexus guise, the left pneumogastric emerges as one trunk, and passes out of the thorax by the oesophageal opening of

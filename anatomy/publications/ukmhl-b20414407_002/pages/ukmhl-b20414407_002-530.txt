500 THE BRAIN. its inferior pedu72cles, or the bonds of union between the medulla and the cerebellum (Fig. 282, d). The transverse fibres of the pons Varolii are gathered together on either side in the form of a large rope-like strand. This dis- appears into the corresponding hemisphere of the cere- bellum and constitutes its middle peduncle (Fig. 282, c). The great mass of the brain is termed the cerebrum. This occupies the anterior and middle cranial fossae, and extends backwards into the occipital region above the tentorium and the cerebellum. The greater part of the cerebrum is formed by the cerebral hemispheres, which are separated from each other in the mesial plane by the great longitudinal fissure. At the bottom of this fissure may be seen the corpus callosum^ a broad commissural band which connects the two cerebral hemispheres with each other. Each hemisphere is hollow—the cavity in its interior being termed the lateralveiitricle of the brain. Between and below the cerebral hemispheres, and almost completely concealed by them, is the inter-brain or the thalamencephalon. The principal parts forming this portion of the brain are the two^ optic thalami, between which is the third ventricle of the brain—a deep, narrow cavity occupying the mesial plane. The third ventricle communicates with the lateral ventricles through two small apertures, termed the foramina of Monro. The cerebrum is connected with the parts in the posterior cranial cavity (pons Varolii, cerebellum, and medulla oblon- gata) by a narrow stalk called the isthmus encephali, the mid-brain, or the mesencephalon. The mid-brain is built up of the crura cerebri, passing from the pons Varolii to the cerebrum (Fig. 282, a), the corpora quadrigemina forming its dorsal part (Fig. 282, b), the superior cerebellar peduncles proceeding from the cerebellum to the cerebrum, &c. It is tunnelled by a narrow passage—the aqueduct of Sylvius— which extends between the fourth and the third ventricles.

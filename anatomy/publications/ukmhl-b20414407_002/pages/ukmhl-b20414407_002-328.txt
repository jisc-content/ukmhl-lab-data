HEAD AXD XECK. 298 palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle. The intermediate stratum, largely composed of involuntary muscular fibres, is inserted into the upper border of the tarsal plate; whilst the deepest lamina is attached to the fornix conjunctivae (Fig. 230). Vessels and Nerves of the Eyelids.—At the inner canthus two arteries—the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic artery —appear and run outwards in the upper and lower lids. At the outer margin of the orbit, one or more branches of the lachrymal artery pierce the palpebral ligament, and anastomose with the palpebral arteries. An arterial arch {arcus tarseus) is thus formed close to the margin of each eyelid, between the orbicularis muscle and the tarsal plate. The veins run inwards towards the root of the nose, and open into the frontal and angular veins. The /lerves are more numerous, and come from a number of different sources. The motor filaments for the palpebral part of the orbicularis are derived from the facial ner^'e, and enter the lids at the outer margin of the orbit. The sen- sory twigs for the upper lid come from the lachry?nal, supra- orbital, supra-trochlear, and infra-trochlear nerves^ whilst the lower lid is supplied by branches from the infra-orbital //if/":". Lactirymal Apparatus.—The following structures are included under this heading :— 1. The lachrymal gland and its ducts. 2. The lachrymal canals. 3. The laclir}Tnal sac and the nasal duct. 4. The tensor tarsi muscle. The Lachrymal Gland hes within the orbit, in the hollow on the roof of this ca\it}-, at the inner side of the external angular process of the frontal bone. The fore-part of the gland projects slightly beyond the orbital margin, and rests upon the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, as it is reflected from the lid on to the eyeball. If the gland be now raised

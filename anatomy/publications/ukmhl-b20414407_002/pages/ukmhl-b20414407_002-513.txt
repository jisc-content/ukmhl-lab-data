MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS. 483 basalis, and within it are placed the large arteries which take part in the formation of the circle of Willis. Leading out from the cisterna basalis there are certain wide subarachnoid channels. Two of these are prolonged into the Sylvian fissures, and in these are accommodated the middle cerebral arteries and some of their branches. In front the basal cistern passes into a space in front of the optic chiasma, and from this it is continued into the great longitudinal fissure above the corpus callosum. In this subarachnoid passage are lodged the anterior cerebral arteries. All the subarachnoid cisterns communicate in the freest manner with each other, and also with the narrow intervals on the surface of the cerebrum. The subarachnoid space does not communicate in any way with the subdural space. In certain localities, however, it communicates with the ventricular system of the brain. Three such apertures are described in connection with the fourth ventricle, whilst another slit is said to lead from the cisterna basalis into the lower end of the descend- ing horn of the lateral ventricle. Pacchionian body Fig. 277.—Diagram of the membranes of the brain and of the Pacchionian bodies. Pacchionian Bodies.—^The connection of the Pacchionian bodies with the arachnoid mater has already been referred to (p. 115). Pia Mater.—The pia mater forms the immediate invest- ment of the brain. It is finer and more dehcate than the corresponding membrane of the spinal cord, and it follows closely all the inequalities on the surface of the brain. Thus, in the case of the cerebrum, it dips down so as to hne both sides of every sulcus and form a fold within it. On the cerebellum the relation is not so intimate; it is only

HEAD AND NECK. 270 posterior trunk. The former joins the facial vein, whilst the latter unites with the posterior auricular vein to form the external jugular. The internal maxillary artery at once passes forwards under cover of the neck of the jaw and disappears from view. The superficial temporal artery may now be fully followed out. The Superficial Temporal Artery (arteria temporalis super- ficialis) appears to be the direct continuation upwards of the external carotid artery. At first in the substance of the parotid, it soon emerges from this, and crossing the root of the zygoma, ascends upon the temporal fascia for a variable distance, and then divides into its two terminal branches, the anterior (ramus frontalis) and posterior superficial tem- poral (ramus parietalis) arteries. These are described in p. no. The superficial temporal artery is closely accom- panied by the auriculo-temporal nerve, and the superficial temporal vein. In addition to its terminal branches it gives offâ€” 1. Parotid twigs. 2. Anterior auricular branches. 3. The transverse facial. The anterior auricular branches (rami auriculares ante- riores) supply the anterior aspect of the external auricle and anastomose with the posterior auricular artery. The transverse facial (arteria transversa faciei) is given off in the substance of the parotid. It runs transversely for- wards, and, emerging from undercover of the anterior border of the gland, proceeds onwards across the masseter to end in twigs which anastomose with branches of the facial, buccal and infra-orbital arteries. Whilst it lies on the masseter muscle it is in relation to the upper border of the parotid duct. The middle temporal (arteria temporalis media) arises immediately above the zygoma, and it pierces the temporal fascia to reach the temporal muscle, and communicate 4. The middle temporal. 5. The orbital.

SECTIONS THROUGH THE TEMPORAL BONE. 6ii On the cut surface of the opposite part of the bone (not figured) several turns of the cochlea will be found to be cut across, and the communica- tion of the bend of the aqueduct of Fallopius with the hiatus Fallopii will be seen. On the same piece of bone the student should also note the canal for the tensor tympani, which is situated immediately above the processus cochleariformis, and the Eustachian tube which lies below that thin bony lamella. He should pass a pin through the Glaserian Fig. 329.—Vertical section of the left temporal bone passing through the hiatus Fallopii, and nearly parallel to the superior border of the petrous bone. 1.

Immediately external to that opening he will find the continuation of the ridge for the membrana tympani. Section II.—The parts in this section are exhibited in Fig. 329. The superior and external semicircular canals are divided, and their ampullae are shown. The middle portion of the aqueduct of Fallopius is laid open, and the two bends of that canal are seen.

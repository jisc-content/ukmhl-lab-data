Ill REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. by the ophthalmic artery, which lies below it. The student should note the strong loose sheath of dura mater which envelops the nerve. The third or ocido-motor fierve—Fig. 193 (4)—is a firm cord-like nerve, which pierces the dura mater in front of the posterior clinoid process, within a triangular area indistinctly marked out by the intersection of the margins of the tentorium, as they pass to be attached to the clinoid pro- cesses. The nerve enters the wall of the cavernous sinus, in which it will be afterwards traced. The minute thread-like fourth or trochlear 7ierve—Fig. 193 (5)—also enters the wall of the cavernous sinus, to gain which it perforates the dura mater a short distance behind, and to the outer side of the third nerve, but within the same triangular area. Its aperture of exit lies under shelter of the free margin of the tentorium. The fifth or trigeminal fierve—Fig. 193 (6)—is composed of two parts—viz., a large, soft, sensory portion, consisting of loosely connected funiculi, and a small, firmer motor portion, which lies upon the inner surface of the sensory part. They can generally be easily distinguished, and both pierce the dura mater at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and under the anterior extremity of the tentorium. The sixth or abdtuefit nerve—Fig. 193 (10)—is a small, round nerve, which disappears through the dura mater at the lower and outer part of the dorsum sellse, and enters the wall of the cavernous sinus. The portio 77iollis, or auditory nerve, the portio dura, or facial nerve, and the small pars interjjiedia all enter the auditory meatus, where the pars intermedia joins the facial nerve. They are accompanied by the auditory artery. The glosso-pharyjigeal, thepneumogastric or vagus, and the spinal accessory nerves pierce the dura mater over the internal jugular foramen in the order in which they have been named, from before backwards. The glosso-pharyngeal has a separate

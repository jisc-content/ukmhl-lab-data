The superficial branches have already been examined, but now that the plexus is fully dissected, the student should again study their mode of origin. Muscular Branches.—The anterior recti muscles and the rectus lateralis receive twigs from the first loop of the plexus, but as this is placed very high up in the neck, these branches can only be satisfactorily displayed in the deep dissection of the neck. The sterfio-mastoid muscle draws one or more twigs from the second cervical nerve, and by means of these

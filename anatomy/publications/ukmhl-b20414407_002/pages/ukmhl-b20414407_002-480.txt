450 HEAD AND NECK. Between the outer aspect of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold and posterior part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, there is a deep depression of mucous membrane on each side, termed the sinuspyriformis (p. 411). The Middle Subdivision of the laryngeal cavity (Fig. 263, B), is the smallest of the three. Above it is bounded by the false vocal cords, below by the true vocal cords, whilst it communicates by the intervals between these folds with the vestibule on the one hand, and the inferior compart- ment of the larynx on the other. The false vocal cords are two prominent mucous folds which extend from before backwards on the side walls of the laryngeal cavity. They are soft and somewhat flaccid, and present a free border which is slightly archedâ€”the con- cavity looking downwards. The interval between the false vocal cords is sometimes termed the false glottis^ and is considerably wider than that between the true vocal cords. It follows from this, that when the cavity of the larynx is examined from above, the four cords are distinctively visible, but when examined from below the true cords alone can be seen. The true vocal cords are placed immediately below the false cords, and are sharp and prominent. The mucous membrane which is stretched over them is so thin that the yellowish colour of the elastic ligaments which support them can readily be discerned. In section each true vocal cord is somewhat prismatic in form, and the free border looks upwards and inwards. The true vocal cords are the agents by means of which the voice is produced. The false vocal cords are of little importance in this respect; indeed, they can in great part be destroyed, and no appreciable difference in the voice result. The riiJia glottidis is the elongated fissure by means of which the middle compartment of the larynx communicates with the lower subdivision. It is placed somewhat below

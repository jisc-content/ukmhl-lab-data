68 THORAX. higher level, upon the right side of the windpipe. To the right side of the artery, in its upper part, are the pleura, the right innominate vein, and the right phrenic nerve. With the exception of the two trunks into which it divides, the innominate artery gives off no branches. The thyroidea ii7ia, an occasional artery, may be seen to spring from it in some cases. Left Common Carotid Artery.—This artery ascends to the posterior aspect of the left sterno-clavicular articulation. Fig. 178.—Transverse section through the superior medi- astinum at the level of the third dorsal vertebra. At this point it leaves the thorax and enters the neck. It lies deeply in the thorax, at a greater distance from the manubrium sterni than the innominate artery. In front of this vessel are the remains of the thymus gland, and the left vena innominata, which crosses it. Behind, it is in relation, in the first instance, to the trachea, and higher up to the oesophagus and thoracic duct. To its left side is the left vagus

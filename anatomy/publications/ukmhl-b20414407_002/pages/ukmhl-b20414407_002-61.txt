THORACIC CAVITY. 39 one-third of the organ is in the right, and about two-thirds in the left half of the thoracic cavity (Fig. 164). The general relations of the organ should now be examined. The base is placed in front of the middle por- tion of the dorsal segment of the vertebral column. Four dorsal vertebrae lie above it, and four below it, whilst the intermediate four (viz., the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th) lie behind it. The apex approaches the anterior wall of the thorax, and in life will be felt beating in the fifth intercostal space of the left side, one and a-half inches below the nipple, and three and a-half inches from the middle line. The through the heart represents the stomach (Fig. 16^, p. face {fades sternalis) of the heart looks upwards as well as forwards, and lies behind the greater part of the gladiolus of the sternum and certain of the costal cartilages. On both sides the third, fourth, and fifth costal cartilages are in front of the heart, but as the chief bulk of the organ is situated to the left of the mesial plane, the left sixth costal cartilage is also in front of it. Three costal cartilages on the right side, therefore, and four on the left side are in relation to the anterior surface of the heart. The pleural sacs and the anterior thin margins of the lungs intervene between the Fig. 164.—The vertical line drawn posterior surface {fades diaphragmatica), which is flattened, and looks more downwards than back- wards, rests upon the diaphragm—the floor of the pericardium alone intervening. Immediately below the cardiac area of the diaphragm is the upper surface of the liver, and in front and to the left a small piece of the mesial plane. (From Braune.) 33). The anterior sur-

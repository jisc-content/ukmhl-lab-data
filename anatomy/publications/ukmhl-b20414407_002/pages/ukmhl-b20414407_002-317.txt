287 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. the superior palpebral ligament, and gives filaments to the skin and conjunctiva. The infra-trochlear ?ierve will be found above the internal tarsal ligament and the inner canthus. The twigs into which it divides communicate with the facial and supply the lachrymal sac, the conjunctiva and the skin of the eyeUds, and the root of the nose. The nasal nerve reaches the face on the side of the mov- able part of the nose. To expose it, divide the compressor naris, and it will be found appearing between the lower margin of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage. It gives branches to the integument of the nose and com- municates with the facial nerve. It can be traced down- wards under cover of the compressor muscle to the tip of the nose. The branches of the superior maxillary divisio?i of the trigeminal nerve which appear on the face are three in number, viz., the temporal branch of the orbital nerve, which has been already studied (p. 108); the malar branch of the orbital nerve ; and the infra-orbital. The malar nerve (ramus subcutaneus malse) is an exceed- ingly minute twig which emerges on the face through a minute foramen on the outer surface of the malar bone, a short distance behind the external margin of the orbit. To expose it the orbicularis palpebrarum must be carefully raised from the bone in an upward direction. The infra-orbital nerve is the terminal part of the superior maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. It is a large branch which issues from the infra-orbital foramen under cover of the levator labii superioris. It forms, with the facial nerve, a dense plexus, and distributes palpebral, nasal, and labial branches. The palpebral twigs turn upwards to supply the skin and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid; the nasal branches incline inwards upon the side of the nose; and the labial branches run downwards to end in the skin and mucous membrane of the upper lip.

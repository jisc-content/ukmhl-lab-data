HEAD AND NECK. 278 buccinator muscle arrange themselves at the angle of the mouth, in the manner already described, into two bundles, and these are prolonged onwards into the two lips so as to encircle the oral aperture, and become continuous with the corresponding fasciculi of the opposite side. These fibres form the marginal part of the orbicularis, and also the deeper peripheral part. The labial portions of the levator anguli LL.N. Fig. 226.â€”Diagram of the orbicularis oris muscle.

The labial slip from the levator anguli oris passes into the lower lip, and the corresponding slip from the depressor anguli oris is continued into the upper Hp. In neither case do the fibres reach the opposite angle of the mouth j they are inserted into the skin at the middle of each

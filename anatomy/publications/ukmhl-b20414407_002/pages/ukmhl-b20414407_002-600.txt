568 THE BRAIN. Anterior Area of the Medulla—Anterior Pyramid.— The district between the antero-median furrow and the row of hypoglossal nerve fascicles issuing from the medulla receives the name of the anterior pyramid. An inspection of the surface is almost sufficient to show that this is formed by a compact mass of longitudinally directed fibres. It expands somewhat, and assumes a more prominent appearance as it passes upwards, and finally reaching the lower border of the pons Varolii, it becomes slightly con- stricted and disappears from view by plunging into that structure. The pyramids ^..-—^ are the great motor strands of the medulla. Although the anterior pyramid at first sight ap- pears to be the continua- tion upwards of the anterior column of the cord, it con- tains within itself only a very small proportion of fibres derived from that source. This will be at once mani- fest if the decussation of the pyramids be examined. For direct pyramidal — tract. — crossed pyramidal tract. this purpose introduce the Fi^^- 309.—Diagram of the decus- back of the knife-blade into pyramids, the antero-median furrow below the decussation, and on one side push forcibly outwards the anterior column of the cord. The pyramid will then be seen to divide at this level into two portions, viz., a small strand termed the direct pyramidal tracts which proceeds downwards into the anterior column of the cord, and takes up a position close to the antero-median furrow, and a much larger strand called the crossed pyramidal tracts which at this level is broken up into three or more coarse bundles which sink backwards, and, at the same time, cross the mesial plane to

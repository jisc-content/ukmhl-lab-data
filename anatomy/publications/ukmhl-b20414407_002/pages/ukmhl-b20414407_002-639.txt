607 THE COCHLEA. superior and posterior canals becoming fused together so as to present a common orifice. One extremity of each canal where it joins the vestibule becomes expanded into what is termed its ampulla. There are thus three ampullated ends. The superior semicircular canal forms the highest part of the labyrinth, and gives rise to a smooth elevation on the anterior surface of the petrous bone, immediately in front of its superior border. It is vertical, and placed somewhat transversely to the long axis of the petrous bone. The posterior semicircular canal, which is the longest of the three tubes, is also vertical, and lies in a plane parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone. The external semi- circular canal is the shortest of the tubes, and occupies a horizontal plane. The Cochlea is a tapering tube which is coiled spirally for two turns and a half around a central pillar, termed the modiolus. The appearance produced is somewhat similar to that of a spiral shell. The cochlea lies in front of the vestibule, with its base directed towards the bottom of the internal auditory meatus; whilst its apex looks forwards and outwards, and comes into close relation with the canal for the tensor tympani muscle. The cochlear tube rapidly diminishes in diameter as it is traced towards the apex of the cochlea, and its closed extremity is termed the cupola. The first turn which it takes around the modiolus produces the bulging of the inner wall of the tympanum, which has been described under the name of the promontory. The modiolus is thick at the base, but rapidly tapers towards the apex. Its base abuts against the bottom of the internal auditory meatus. It forms the inner wall of the cochlear tube, and winding spirally round it like the thread of a screw is a thin lamina of bone, which partially sub- divides the tube into two compartments. This is termed the lamina spiralis.

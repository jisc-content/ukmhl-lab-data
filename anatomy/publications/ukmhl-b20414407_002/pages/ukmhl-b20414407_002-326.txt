The superior ligament blends along the orbital arch w^ith the pericranium, clothing the frontal bone, and with the periosteum lining the roof of the orbit, whilst inferiorly it blends with the expanded tendon of the levator palpebn'e superioris. The inferior ligament is continuous on the one hand with the lower margin and anterior aspect of the lower tarsal plate, and on the other with the peri- osteum of the face and the floor of the orbit. Towards the inner canthus, where the eyelids are supported by the Fig. 230.â€”Diagram of the structure of the eyelids. internal tarsal ligament, the palpebral ligaments become thin and delicate. The Tarsal Ligaments should in the next place be ex- amined. The palpebral ligaments fix the tarsi to the upper and lower margins of the orbit; the tarsal Hgaments attach the tarsi to the outer and inner orbital margins. The external tarsal ligament is a narrow band of no great strength, which springs from the malar bone where this forms the outer margin of the orbit and proceeds inwards.

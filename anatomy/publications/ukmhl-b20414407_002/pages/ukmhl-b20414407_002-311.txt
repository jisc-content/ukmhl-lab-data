DISSECTION OF THE FACE. facialis. The sensory nerves come from various sources, and they reach the face either directly or indirectly through the medium of filaments which join branches of the facial nerve. The following table shows the derivation of these nerves :— Nerves of the Face. I. Motor. Facial nerve. II. Sensory. {a.) Appearing directly on the face, 1. Facial branches of the great auricular nerve. 2. Branches of the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial), viz. -Supra-orbital. Supra-trochlear. Infra-trochlear. Palpebral branch of the lachrymal. ^Nasal. Infra-orbital. Subcutaneus malce. (^Temporal branch of the orbital. 1 . r ■ {Auriculo-temporal. rrom the mienor _ , , ^ ... T . • 1 Long buccal, maxillary division. , ^ I Mental. {b.) Reaching the face indirectly. 1. Communicating branches from the great auricular nerve to the facial nerve. 2. Communicating branches from the auriculo-temporal nerve to the facial nerve. Whilst, therefore, the motor filaments come from one source alone, the sensory nerves are derived partly from the cervical plexus through the great auricular nerve, but chiefly from the trigeminal nerve, each division of which furnishes several branches to the face. Dissection.—The facial nerve is already, in a great measure, dis- played. Its exit from the stylo-niastoid foramen can be rendered more evident by chipping off the free projecting part of the mastoid process. In doing this first use the saw, and then complete the severance with the From the ophthalmic division. From the superior J i maxillary division.

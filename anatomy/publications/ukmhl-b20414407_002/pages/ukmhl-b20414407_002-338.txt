3o8 HEAD AND NECK. The External Pterygoid Muscle (musculus pterygoideus externus) arises in the zygomatic fossa by two heads, an upper and a lower. The upper head springs from the infra- temporal ridge and the zygomatic surface of the great wing of the sphenoid; the lozver head takes origin from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate. As the muscle passes backwards it diminishes somewhat in width, and is Fig. 234.â€”Dissection of the pter}'go-maxillaty space. T. Ant. deep temporal ner%'e and artery. I 3.

The Internal Pterygoid Muscle (musculus pterygoideus internus) is also bicipital at its origin. Its two heads em- brace the origin of the lower head of the external pterygoid.

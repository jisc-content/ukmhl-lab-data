173 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. In the female the average length of the spinal cord is sixteen and a quarter inches; in the male it is seventeen and a half inches. Throughout the greater part of the dorsal region the spinal cord presents a uniform girth, but in the cervical and lower dorsal regions it shows marked swellings, termed respectively the cervical and lumbar e7ilarge7ne?its. From these expansions proceed the nerves which supply the upper and lower limbs. The cervical swellifig (intumescentia cervicalis) is the more evident of the two. It begins at the upper end of the cord and attains its greatest breadth (13 to 14 mm.) opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra. Below it subsides opposite the second dorsal vertebra. The lumbar swelling (intumescentia lumbalis) begins at the level of the tenth dorsal vertebra, and attains its maximum trans- verse diameter (11 to 13 mm.) opposite the last dorsal vertebra. Below it rapidly tapers into the tapering conus medullaris. Filum Terminale.â€”This delicate thread-like filament lies amidst the numerous long nerve-roots which occupy the lower part of the spinal canal, and it can readily be detected from these (i) by its silvery glistening appearance, and (2) by its continuity with the extremity of the co?ius medullaris. Although the central canal of the spinal cord is prolonged down in its interior for nearly half its length, and nervous elements can be traced in its substance for a like distance, the filum terminale is chiefly composed of pia mater carried downwards from the conus medullaris. The linea splendens and the lower ends of the ligamenta denticulata may also be considered to be continued into it. At the level of the second or third sacral vertebra it pierces the tapered end of the tube of dura mater, and receives an investment from it, and, finally, reaching the lower end of the sacral canal, it terminates by blending with the periosteum on the back of the coccyx or last piece of the sacrum.

THORACIC CAVITY. 41 The heart lies free within the sac formed by the peri- cardium, except where it is attached by the great vessels which are connected with its basal portion. Its position is influenced, to a certain extent, by the position of the body. External Configuration of the Heart.—In studying the form and appearance of the heart, the dissector will find it advantageous to refer to an injected specimen. At the Fig. 166.—Anterior aspect {fades stenialis) of the heart. (From Gegenbaur.) Ventr. d. Right ventricle. 1 Aur. Right auricular appendix. Ventr, s. Left ventricle. | Atriujii d. Right atrium. same time he should remember that such a specimen is apt to convey an erroneous impression, in so far that during life the auricular and the ventricular chambers are never fully distended at the same time. The interior of the heart is divided by an internal parti- tion into a right and a left cavity. Further, each of these is still further subdivided into an upper auricular and a lower ventricular chamber., which communicate freely with

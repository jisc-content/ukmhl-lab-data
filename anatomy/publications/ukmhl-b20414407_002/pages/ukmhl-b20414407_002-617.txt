CEREBELLAR PEDUXCLES. 5S5 the interior. Further, the complete manner in which the surface is cut up by the fissures and sulci into secondary and tertiary folia is seen. The central mass of white matter is termed the corpus trapezoides. From this, main prolonga- tions pass into the various lobules, and these give off branches so as to supply each folium with a central white stem or core. The term arbor vitce. is applied to the appear- ance which consequently results when a section is made through the cerebellum. Cerebellar Peduncles.—These are three in number on each side—viz., the middle, the superior, and the inferior. They are all directly connected with the white medullary centre of the cerebellum, and are composed of fibres which emerge from or enter the white central substance of the organ. The jniddle pediuide is much the largest of the three. It is formed by the transverse fibres of the pons, and it enters the cerebellar hemisphere on the outer side of the other two. The lips of the anterior part of the great horizontal fissure are separated widely from each other to give it admission. Within the cerebellar hemisphere its fibres are distributed in two great bundles. Of these, one composed of the upper transverse fibres of the pons, radiates out in the lower part of the hemisphere; whilst the other, consisting of the lower transv erse fibres of the pons, spreads out in the upper part of the hemisphere. The inferior pedu)icle is simply the restiform body of the medulla. It emerges from the white matter of the cere- bellar hemisphere between the other two peduncles. At first directed forwards, it then turns sharply downwards so as to form the upper part of the posterior area of the .medulla (/>., the restiform body). The superior pedujides are composed of fibres which for the most part come from the corpus dentatum of the cerebellar hemisphere. As they issue from the cerebellum, each peduncle lies close to the inner side of the corresponding

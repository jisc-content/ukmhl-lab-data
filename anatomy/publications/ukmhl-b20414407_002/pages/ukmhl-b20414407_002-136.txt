HEAD AND NECK. 114 it is connected with the deep surface of the bones. These have necessarily been torn asunder in the removal of the skull-cap. The bleeding points are most numerous along the middle line, or, in other words, along the line of the superior longitudinal sinus; and if the handle of the knife be run from before backwards, so as to make pressure along this line, a considerable quantity of blood will ooze out. This shows that a number of small veins from the cranial bones have been rup- tured. The degree of adhesion between the dura mater and the inner surface of the cranial bones varies in different subjects and in different localities. In all cases it is most adherent along the lines of the sutures ; and, further, it is very much more firmly at- tached to the base than the vault of the cranium. In the child—indeed, as long as the bones of the cranium are growing— it is more adherent than in the adult; and it is also more firmly bound to the bone in old age. The dissector should now wipe the outer surface of the dura mater with a sponge. He will then recognise the Fig. 188. — Diagrammatic section through an arachnoidal vilhis. (SCHWALBE.) pa.

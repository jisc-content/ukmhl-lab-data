THE CEREBRUM. 535 at an acute angle (Fig. 294). It is bounded in front by the posterior surface of the genu of the corpus callosum, whilst the roof is formed by the fore part of the same structure. The imier wall, which is vertical, is formed by the septum lucidum — a thin mesial partition between the lateral ventricles of opposite sides. The sloping floor presents a marked elevation or bulging, viz., the smooth rounded and Fig. 294.—Coronal section through the right cerebral hemisphere and the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. (Gegenbaur.) enlarged anterior extremity of the pear-shaped caudate nucleus. The Body of the Lateral Ventricle is likewise roofed by the corpus callosum. On the inner or mesial side it is bounded by the hinder part of the septum lucidum, and behind this by the attachment of the fornix to the under surface of the corpus callosum. On the outer side it is closed, as in the case of the anterior horn, by the meeting of the roof and the floor of the cavity. On the floor a number of important objects may be

561 THE LENTICULAR NUCLEUS. divided lenticular nucleus assumes an altogether different shape, and is seen to be completely cut off from the caudate nucleus by the internal capsule (Fig. 305). It is now triangular or wedge-shaped. Its base is turned towards the external capsule, the claustrum, and the island of Reil; its internal surface is applied to the internal cap- sule ; whilst its inferior surface is directed downwards towards the base of the brain. But, further, two white laminae are now evident, the exterfial and the internal medullary lamince^ which traverse its substance and divide it Fig. 304.— Coronal section through the anterior part of the corpus striatum. (From Gegenbaur.) into three zones. The outer, basal, and larger zone, is termed the putamen (Fig. 305, i). It is darker in colour than the other two zones, and is traversed by fine radiating white streaks. The two inner zones are of a faint yellowish tint, and they together form what is termed the globus pallidus (Fig. 305, 2 and 3). The putamen has a greater antero- posterior length than the globus pallidus. It follows from this that it alone is connected with the head of the caudate nucleus by the intervening bands of grey matter (Fig. 304). VOL. II.—36

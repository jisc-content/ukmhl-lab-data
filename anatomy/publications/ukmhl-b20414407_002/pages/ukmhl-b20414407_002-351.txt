SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 321 jaw, and unite with the hngual nerve near its origin. It is joined by a slender filament from the otic ganglion. Otic Ganglion.—As this ganglion lies under cover of the inferior maxillary trunk, it cannot be satisfactorily studied at this stage. It is true that it may be exposed by tracing the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle upwards, when it will be seen to be developed in connection with the root of this branch. Its connections, however, can only be made out by dissecting from the inside, and it is well to defer its examination until this can be done. Dissection.—The student should now endeavour, by means of a Hey's saw, a chisel, and the bone-pliers, to remove the outer table of the lower jaw, and thus open up the mandibular canal. Structures within the Mandibular Canal.—This canal is traversed by the inferior dental artery and nerve. These give off twigs which enter the fangs of the molar and bicuspid teeth, and they each terminate by dividing into a mental and incisor branch. The mental artery and nerve appear on the face through the mental foramen, and have already been examined; the incisor artery and nerve are carried forwards to the symphysis and send up twigs to the canine and incisor teeth. The vessel anastomoses in the bone with the corre- sponding artery of the opposite side. SUBMAXILLARY REGION. The superficial area of the submaxillary region has already been dissected, under the name of the anterior part of the digastric or submaxillary triangle (p. 220). It is now necessary to carry the dissection to a deeper plane, in order to expose a number of parts in connection with the tongue and floor of the mouth. The structures thus displayed are:— VOL II.—21

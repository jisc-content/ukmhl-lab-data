51 THORACIC CAVITY. with care and deliberation, but more especially the second one. In this case the auriculo-ventricular valve is liable to injury, and it is well to protect it by introducing the forefinger of the left hand through the auriculo-ventricular opening into the ventricle. The anterior wall of the right ventricle can, in this way, be raised in the form of a V-shaped flap and turned to the right. Wash away the blood and clots. Right Ventricle. — The cavity of the right ventricle, now laid open and exposed to view, is of a somewhat triangular form, the base being directed upwards, and the apex downwards to- wards the apex of the heart. It does not reach the apex of the heart, however, but cor- responds to the junction of the anterior and pos- terior interventricular furrows around the right sharp margin of the heart. On transverse section, the cavity of the right ventricle is semi- lunar in outline, owing to the thick fleshy in- terventricular septum which constitutes its inner and posterior wall bulging into it (Fig. its upper part, and thins Fig. 170.—Diagram to show the manner in which the right ventricle should be opened. The dotted lines indicate the direction of the incisions. In the anterior interventricular furrow the coronary artery and the great cardiac vein are seen, a, Superior vena cava; b. Pulmonary artery ; c, Aorta. 171). The wall is thickest at slightly towards the apex. With the exception of the conus arteriosus, the interior of which is smooth and even, the inner surface of the walls

HEAD AND NECK. 444 branches to the auricular nerve from the vagus. The last of these is probably destroyed by the dissection, but the other two can be brought into view by gently raising the nerve from the anterior wall of the canal. By using the chisel in front, and to the inner side of the geniculate ganglion, the cochlea will be exposed. Intrapetrous Portion of the Facial Nerve.—As the facial nerve traverses the petrous bone, it may be divided into four stages, which differ from each other in the relations they present and in the direction which they take. They are :— 1. A part within the internal auditory meatus. 2. A very short part which extends from the bottom of the internal auditory foramen to the geniculate ganglion. 3. A part which occupies that portion of the aqueduct of Fallopius which runs along the inner wall of the tympanum. 4. A part which extends vertically downwards to the stylo-mastoid foramen. First stage.—In the internal auditory meatus, the facial nerve runs almost directly outwards in company with the auditory nerve and the pars intermedia. In this stage of its course it lies in relation to the upper and fore part of the auditory nerve, and is joined by the pars intermedia. At the bottom of the auditory meatus it enters the aqueduct of Fallopius. Second stage.—The second part of the facial nerve is very short. It runs outwards with a slight inclination forwards between the vestibule and cochlea, and very soon ends in the swelling termed the geniculate ganglion. Third stage.—At the geniculate ganglion, the facial nerve bends suddenly and then proceeds backwards and slightly downwards in that portion of the aqueduct which runs along the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum, imme- diately above the foramen ovale. The first three portions of the facial nerve are nearly horizontal, and pursue a somewhat V-shaped course. The apex of the V is directed forwards, and corresponds to the geniculate ganglion.

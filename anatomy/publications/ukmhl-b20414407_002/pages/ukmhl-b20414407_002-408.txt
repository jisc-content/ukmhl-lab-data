HEAD AND NECK. 378 Check and Suspensory Ligaments.—The connections of the capsule of Tenon to the walls of the orbital cavity are somewhat complicated. The suspensory ligament (Lock- wood) is perhaps the most important of these. It stretches across the fore part of the orbit, after the fashion of a ham- mock, and gives support to the eyeball. Its two extremities are narrow, and are attached respectively to the malar and lachrymal bones. Below the eyeball it widens out and blends with the capsule of Tenon. The external and in- ternal check ligaments also constitute bonds of union between tendon of internal capsule of Tenon thrown rectus. back from eyeball. Fig. 246.—Dissection of the capsule of Tenon from the front. the capsule of Tenon and the orbital wall. They are strong bands which pass from the sheaths around the external and internal recti muscles to obtain attachment to the malar and lachrymal bones respectively; here they are brought into association with the extremities of the suspensory ligament. The function of the check ligaments is easily understood. They limit the contraction of the external and internal recti muscles, and thus prevent excessive rotation of the eyeball in an outward or inward direction. There is a similar but

REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 117 contrast between the two surfaces of the dura mater will be observed. The superficial surface, as we have noted, is rough and fiocculent. The deep surface, which is turned to- wards the subdural space, is smooth, polished, and glistening. The Cerebral Veins returning the blood from the surface of the cerebral hemispheres will be seen shining through the arachnoid. They are lodged in the sulci Fig. 189.—The dura mater and the superior longitudinal sinus, &c. The lines along which the dura mater should be incised in removing the brain are indicated by dotted lines on the right side. between the convolutions, and run upwards to the middle line. Reaching the superior longitudinal sinus they are suddenly directed forwards, and lie against the wall of the sinus for some distance before they open into it (Fig. 189). Superior Longitudinal Sinus (sinus sagittalis superior). —Open into this venous channel by running the knife

187 SIDE OF THE NECK. posterior column is wedge-shaped in transverse section, and lies between the postero-median fissure and the posterior cornu of grey matter. The lateral coluiim occupies the concavity of the grey crescent. Behind, it is bounded by the posterior grey cornu and the postero-lateral sulcus, whilst in front it extends as far as the outermost fasciculi of the anterior nerve roots as they pass out from the anterior grey horn. The anterior column includes the white matter between the antero-median fissure and the anterior horn of grey matter, and also the white matter which separates the thick extremity of the anterior grey cornu from the surface of the cord. This latter portion of the anterior column is traversed by the emerging fascicles of the anterior nerve roots. In the cervical region a faint longitudinal groove runs dowaiwards on the surface of the posterior column of the cord. This indicates the position of a septum which passes into the column from the deep surface of the pia mater and divides it incompletely into two unequal strands. The groove is termed the paramedian furrow : the smaller and more internal of the two strands is called the postero-median coluum or the tract of Goll, whilst the outer and larger strand receives the name of the postero-exterftal colunm or the tract of Burdach. The w^hite matter of the spinal cord increases steadily in quantity from below upwards. SIDE OF THE NECK. Four days having now been devoted to the dissection of the posterior aspect of the body, the subject is turned on its back, and blocks being placed under the thorax and pelvis, the dissection of the side of the neck is commenced. This region may be said to present a somewhat quadrilateral figure, hi front., it is bounded by the middle fine of the neck; behind, it is limited by a line corresponding to the

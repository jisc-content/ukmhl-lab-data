275 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. more frequently it takes independent origin from the fascia covering the masseter, although some of its fibres come directly from the platysma. It is composed of a few slender fasciculi which pass transversely forwards in the fatty tissue of the cheek to the angle of the mouth, where they are inserted into the skin. The Depressor Anguli Oris is a flat triangular muscle which presents a broad origin from the external oblique line of the lower jaw. From this it proceeds upwards to the angle of the mouth. Here its fibres, which are collected in the form of a narrow bundle, are partly inserted into the skin, and partly prolonged into the upper lip in the orbi- cularis oris. The mental branch of the mandibular nerve and its accompanying artery appear on the face under cover of this muscle Levator Labii Superioris Alseaue Nasi.—This is a thin fleshy band which lies along the side of the nose. It is narrow above where it arises from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, but it expands somewhat as it proceeds downwards, and finally it divides into two slips—a nasal and a labial. The inner and smaller nasal slip is inserted into the wing of the nose, whilst the labial slip is prolonged into the upper lip, where some of its fibres blend with the orbicularis oris, and others obtain a direct attach- ment to the skin. The Levator Labii Superioris arises from the lower margin of the orbital opening, immediately above the infra-orbital foramen. It takes the form of a flat band which proceeds downwards and slightly inwards, to end in the skin of the upper lip. Under cover of this muscle the large i?ifra- orbital nerve emerges on the face, and joins with branches of the facial nerve in the infra-orbital plexus. The Zygomaticus Minor may be looked upon as a part of the preceding muscle. It is also closely connected with the orbicularis palpebrarum, from which some of its

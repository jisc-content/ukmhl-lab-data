312 HEAD AND NECK. the superficial temporal vein behind the neck of the jaw, to form the temporo-maxillary trunk. The pterygoid venous plexus also estabhshes by various offsets, certain highly important connections. From its fore part the deep facial vein proceeds; this extends forwards under cover of the lower jaw and the masseter, and unites with the facial vein. Entering its upper part are one or more minute emissary veins from the cavernous sinus. These gain the exterior of the cranium by passing through the foramen ovale. It likewise communicates with the ophthal- mic vein through the spheno-maxillary fissure. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation (articulatiomandibularis). —This joint must next be studied, in order that the external pterygoid muscle may be thrown forwards. In connection with it we find— Ligaments Proper. Accessory Ligaments. 1. The external lateral. 2. The capsular. An interarticula 1. Internal lateral. 2. Stylo-maxillary, f fibro-cartilage. The external lateral ligament is a strong band which is attached above to the outer surface of the posterior part of the zygomatic arch and to the tubercle at the root of the zygoma. It is composed of short parallel fibres, which proceed obliquely downwards and backwards to be inserted into the outer and hinder part of the neck of the lower jaw. The capsule of the joint consists of a few scattered fibres, which support the synovial membranes upon the inner, anterior, and posterior aspects of the articulation. The internal lateral ligament is a long membranous band which springs from the spinous process of the sphenoid, and is attached below to the lingula and to the sharp inner margin of the mandibular foramen. It is not in direct

DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 271 with the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillary artery. The orbital artery (arteria zygomatico-orbitalis) is an inconstant branch which runs forwards above the zygoma to supply the outer part of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and the skin in this neighbourhood. Muscles of the Face.—The muscles of the face are arranged in groups around the different facial apertures. There is thus a palpebral and superciliary group in relation to each orbital opening ; an oral group around the mouth ; and a nasal group in connection with the nose. Each of these groups may be examined in turn. It is convenient to begin with the palpebral and superciliary muscles. These are three in number :— 1. Orbicularis palpebrarum. 2. Tensor tarsi (Horner's muscle). 3. Corrugator supercilii. The upper eyelid has a special elevator, termed the levator palpebrce superioris, but this muscle is contained within the orbital cavity, and does not come under the notice of the dissector at the present stage. The examination of the tensor tarsi must also be deferred until the eyelids are dissected. Internal Tarsal Ligament.—If the eyelids be drawn outwards, a prominent cord-like ligament becomes apparent on the inner side of the inner canthus. This extends out- wards from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone to reach the eyelids, and is termed the internal tarsal ligament. It will be afterwards more fully examined, but it is necessary to notice it at present, seeing that it is closely connected with the origin of the orbicularis palpebrarum. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum (orbicularis oculi) is the sphincter muscle of the palpebral fissure. It is a thin sheet of muscular fibres, which occupies a very consider- able area of the face. It is customary to regard it as being composed of two parts, a palpebral and an orbital.

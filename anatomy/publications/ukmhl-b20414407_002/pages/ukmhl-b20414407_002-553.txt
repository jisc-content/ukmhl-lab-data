THE CEREBRUM. 523 bounded by a distinct limiting sulcus (sulcus circularis Reilii) which has already been described, and its dependent apical part, which looks downwards, is in close relation to the Sylvian vallecula and the anterior perforated spot on the base of the brain. The insula is divided into several diverging convolutions by a series of radiating sulci. Of the latter, one, which pre- s.R.^. S.R./. Fig. 288.â€”Fissures and gyri on the surface of the insula.

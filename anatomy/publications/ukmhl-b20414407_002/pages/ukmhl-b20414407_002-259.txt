229 SIDE OF THE NECK. Hypoglossal Nerve.—The portion of the hypoglossal nerve which traverses the anterior triangle can be studied at this stage. It appears by emerging from under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric, and immediately turns forwards by hooking round the occipital artery. Near the upper border of the hyoid bone it disappears from the present dissection by passing under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle. It forms a loop on the side of the neck which lies upon the external carotid and lingual arteries and finally, above the hyoid bone, upon the hyoglossus muscle. It is crossed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric and the two slips of insertion of the stylo-hyoid. Two branches will be seen to arise from this portion of the hypoglossal nerve, viz.:— 1. The ramus descendens. 2. The thyro-hyoid. The ramus descendejis hypoglossi, as a rule, leaves the hypoglossal nerve at the point where it turns round the occipital artery. It proceeds downwards and inwards so as to cross the common carotid artery very obliquely. Reaching the upper border of the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, it ends by joining a slender branch which advances towards it from the second and third cervical nerves. This nerve is called the ramus cervicalis descendens and by its union with the ramus descendens hypoglossi a nerve-loop is formed in front of the common carotid artery, which is called the aiisa hypoglossi (Fig. 218). From the convexity of this loop branches are given off which supply both bellies of the omo-hyoid, the sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles. The branches for the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid may proceed from the ramus descendens hypoglossi before it reaches the ramus cervicalis descendens. The filament for the posterior belly runs downwards and backwards along the lower border of the intermediate tendon, and between

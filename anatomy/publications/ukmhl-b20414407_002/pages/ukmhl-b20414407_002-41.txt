19 THORACIC CAVITY. Behind the manubrium sterni the two pleural sacs are separated from each other by an angular interval, but near the upper end of the gladiolus they come together, and proceed downwards in close contact, and slightly to the left of the mesial plane, as far as the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage. Not only are they in contact, but in trans- verse sections through the chest, it will be seen that the left pleural sac in this position slightly overlaps the right pleural sac (Fig. 159). At the level of the attachment of the fourth costal cartilage to the sternum the two sacs part company. The left pleura deviates outwards, whilst the Fig. 159.â€”Tracing from a transverse section through the frozen chest, at the level of the junction of the third costal cartilages with the sternum. S.

Here it turns sharply outwards, and running obliquely downwards and backwards upon the deep surface of the seventh costal cartilage, is reflected from this on to the upper surface of the diaphragm. Following the line of diaphragmatic reflec- tion on the right side, it will be seen to continue in a downward and backward direction across the bony extremity of the eighth rib, across the ninth rib, until it reaches in the axillary line the ninth intercostal space, or, perhaps, the upper margin of the tenth rib. Crossing the tenth rib, it

CRANIO-VERTEBRAL JOINTS. 393 tube of dura mater which still remains in the spinal canal must next be carefully detached. A broad membranous band stretching upwards over the posterior aspect of the body and odontoid process of the axis is displayed. This is the posterior occipito-axial ligament. The Posterior Occipito-axial Ligament (membrana tectoria) (Fig. 250, 4; and Fig. 251, 4 and 5) is a broad Fig. 251.â€”Ligaments on the anterior wall of the spinal canal which connect the occipital bone, the atlas, and axis. The posterior occipito-axial ligament and the superior appendix of the cruciform ligament have been partially removed, their attached extremities being alone left in position (From Luschka, slightly modified.) 1. Portion of theatlanto-occipital capsular ligament. 2. Appendix superior of the cruciform ligament cut across. 3. Appendix inferior of the cruciform ligament. 4. Lower part of posterior occipito-axial ligament thrown downwards. 5. Upper part of the posterior occipito- axial ligament thrown upwards. 6. Upper attachment of appendix superior. 7. Hypoglossal nerve. 8. Two parts of the suspensory odon- toid ligament. 9. Alar or check ligament. 10. Odontoid process. IT. Transverse ligament. 12. Accessory atlanto-axial ligament.

NASAL NERVE. 369 in different subjects. It is placed in the back part of the orbit between the optic nerve and the external rectus muscle, and very commonly on the outer side of the ophthalmic artery. By its posterior border it receives its three roots ; whilst from its anterior border the short ciliary nerves are given off. The sensory root comes from the nasal, and is called the long root. It enters the upper and hinder angle of the ganglion. The short or ijiotor root is a short, stout trunk ; it comes from the branch of the oculomotor nerve, which goes to the inferior oblique muscle, and it enters the lower and hinder angle of the ganglion. The sympathetic root comes from the cavernous plexus, and joins the posterior border of the ganglion, close to the entrance of the long root from the nasal nerve. In some cases it joins the long root before it reaches the ganglion. The short ciliary nerves are from four to six in number, and they come off in two groups, of which one emerges from the upper and fore angle of the ganglion, whilst the other VOL.

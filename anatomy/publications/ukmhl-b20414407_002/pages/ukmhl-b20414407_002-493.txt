THE LARYNX. 463 border of the inferior constrictor muscle. It now is observed to ascend upon the outer aspect of the cricoid cartilage, im- mediately behind the crico-thyroid joint. Here it is joined by the communicating twig from the internal laryngeal nerve, and almost immediately afterwards it divides into two branches. The larger of these proceeds upwards, under cover of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and breaks up into filaments which supply the lateral crico-arytenoid, the thyro- arytenoid, and the thyro-ary-epiglottidean muscles; the S7naller or posterior branch inclines upwards and backwards upon the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, and under cover of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle. It supplies twigs to this muscle, and is then continued onwards to end in the arytenoid muscle. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is therefore the motor nerve of the larynx. It supplies all the muscles with the exception of the crico-thyroid, which draws its nerve-supply from the external laryngeal. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, however, is usually considered to contain a few sensory fibres. These it gives to the mucous membrane of the larynx below the rima glottidis. Laryngeal Arteries.—The superior laryngeal artery, a branch of the superior thyroid, accompanies the internal laryngeal nerve; the i?iferior laryngeal artery which springs from the inferior thyroid accompanies the recurrent laryngeal nerve. These two vessels ramify in the laryngeal wall and supply the mucous membrane, glands and muscles. Laryngeal Cartilages and Joints.—The cartilages which constitute the skeleton of the larynx and give support to its wall are the following :— They are held together by certain ligaments and joints. 4. Arytenoid, 5. Cornicula laryngis or cartilages of Santorini, 6. Cuneiform, paired.

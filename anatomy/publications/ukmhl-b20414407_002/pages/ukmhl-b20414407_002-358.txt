HEAD AND NECK. 328 immediately external to the symphysis. Below^ it is supported by the mylo-hyoid muscle. Its anterior extremity reaches the mesial plane above the anterior border of the genio-hyo-glossus and is in contact with its fellow of the opposite side. The duct of Wharton and the lingual nerve are prolonged forwards under cover of the sublingual gland. Numerous small ducts (the number varying from eight to twenty) proceed from the sublingual gland. These are called the ducts of Rivini, and they have two modes of termination. Some open into Wharton's duct; others open directly into the mouth by piercing the mucous membrane which overlies the gland. One of the latter, larger than the others, receives the special name of the duct of Bartholt?i, and this opens into the mouth close to the orifice of the duct of Wharton. Lingual Nerve.—In the dissection of the pterygo-maxillary region, the lingual nerve has been seen passing downwards between the ramus of the mandible and the internal pterygoid muscle. It now inclines forwards to reach the side of the tongue, and, passing over the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, it lies below the last molar tooth between the mucous membrane and the body of the mandible. At this point it is in danger of being hurt by the clumsy extraction of one of the lower molars, and here also it may be divided by the surgeon, from the inside of the mouth. In its further course the nerve keeps close to the side of the tongue, crossing the upper part of the hyo-glossus, and, beyond this, the duct of Wharton. It is placed immediately under the mucous membrane of the mouth, and it can be traced as far as the tip of the tongue. The branches which proceed from the lingual nerve in this region are of two kinds—(i) twigs of communication; (2) branches of distribution. II. Two or more to the submaxillary ganglion. 2. One or two which descend along the anterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle to unite with the hypoglossal nerve.

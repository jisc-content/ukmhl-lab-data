210 [sect. v. THE SKIN, mention only scabies or itch, clue to the settlement of the Acarus scabiei (Art. 225) in the epidermis. The itch-mite pierces the homy layer and bores its way obliquely through it till it reaches the rete mucosum in the neighbourhood of the papillae. As the epidermal cells grow and approach the surface, it continues to work its way downwards so as always to keep below. In this wa}'- it gives rise to burrows (cuniculi) which penetrate the skin obliquely and are irregularly zigzagged and curved: they may reach the length of one or two centimetres. The mite sits at the blind end of the burrow (Fig. 164), leaving behind its excreta (/) in the form of yellow, brown, or black grains and lumps. The female also lays its eggs in the burrow, and as these are hatched the young mites may be seen in all stages of development (e). The irritation caused by the mite directly and by the scratching which it induces gives rise to eczematous inflammation of the skin, with the formation of vesicles and pustules. Pus may collect beneath the burrows of the Acarus. When the affection is allowed to become chronic the skin may be very gravely altered, the epidermal layers being greatly thickened and pervaded by the burrows in all directions. Inflammatory hypertrophy of the cutis takes place, and the papillae (b) become enlarged and notably elongated. The horny layer (a) may become almost honeycombed or cavernous from the number of burrows which traverse it.

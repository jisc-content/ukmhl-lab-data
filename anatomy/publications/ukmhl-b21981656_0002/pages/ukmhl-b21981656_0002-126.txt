THE SPLEEN AND THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. [SECT. III. 106 may take up fluid and become diffluent or liquefied, or they may become calcareous. The second or firm variety of caseous necrosis begins as a homogeneous degeneration. It occurs mainly in hyperplastic (Art. 340) and tuberculous (Art. 342) glands, which often have a glassy or translucent appearance even to the naked eye. The process is found on examination to start in a uniform or homogeneous transformation of the entire tissue, or of single cells -in it, which take the form of shining flakes or lumps and gradually lose their nuclei. If the tissue so changed passes on into the soft variety of caseation, it breaks up into a granular friable mass. Necrotic patches, made up of greyish friable moist tissue, are formed in the glands generally after acute inflammatory swelling, such as often accompanies typhoid fever and diphtheria. The lymphoid cells are partially trans- formed into pale denucleated lumps, which speedily disintegrate. Such patches may go on to gangrenous putrefaction; or losing fluid may become condensed and cheesy-looking. In the latter case calcification often follows, and the entire gland may be transformed into a chalky or mortar-like mass. Stratified concretions (Fig. 134 b) not infrequently take the place of fw. 134. Chalky concretions. diffuse calcareous deposits. They a from au inflamed omentum are especially common in connexion h from a tuberculous lymphatic with tuberculous disease. ^land

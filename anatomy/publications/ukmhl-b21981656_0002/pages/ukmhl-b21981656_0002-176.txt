[sect. v. THE SKIN. 156 By the heat the epidermal cells are partially destroyed, and the vessels of the cutis are more or less disorganised. The vessels pour out an exudation, which passes from the tips of the papillae into the epidermal layers. The cells already killed or injured by the heat are thereby swollen up (Fig. 145 d), and soon dissolve completely (/). This takes place at first immediately over the papillae (df). The inter-papillary cells (e) may hold out for a time; but they are apt to be stretched and distorted by the exudation, and as soon as this becomes sufficiently abundant they too swell up and then dissolve (g). Coagulation sets in as the cells dissolve and the place is taken by granular and fibrous masses whose forms correspond in general to the cell-areas, and so maintain for a time the configuration of the rete Malpighii (Fig. 149). The free and abundant exudation whiclx by its pressure raises the horny layer of the epidermis depresses and flattens the papillae (i). If the exudation continues after the solution and coagulation of the epidermal layers, the entire fibrinous mass may itself be lifted by a new accumulation (k) taking place beneath it. 371.

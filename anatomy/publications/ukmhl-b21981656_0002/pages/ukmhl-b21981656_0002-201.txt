XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. often induced (h), and epidermal growths penetrate the deeper layers of the skin; when they reach a certain size they remind one of the cellular ingrowths of carcinoma. The surface layers may more- over be here and there swollen, or vacuolated, or in process, of desquamation. Fig. 154.

The glands cease to secrete sebum, and may become greatly distended and enlarged by the accumulation in their ducts of epithelial cells. Sometimes the cellular infiltration is most dense in the immediate neighbourhood of the sebaceous glands. The infiltrated tissue generally becomes necrotic, softens, and breaks through the epidermis (g); in this way lupous ulcers are formed which by gradual advance may involve a very large extent of the surface. In some cases however the nodules are re-absorbed without ulceration. Some of the extravasated cells are utilised in forming new fibrous tissue, and the papillae may in this way become notably enlarged, the skin as a whole may thicken, and at length the ulcerated tissue may be replaced by a cicatrix. After a time the new tissue contracts and a puckered scar is left. Lupus first appears as a local eruption of small bright red or brownish spots (Kaposi) ; after a time nodular prominences can be seen and felt under the skin, and the nodules coalesce so as to

THE SPLEEN AND THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. [SECT. 111. 112 340. Large-celled indurative hyperplasia of the lymphatic glands is distinguished by the transformation of the normal gland- tissue into a large-celled tissue having none of the characters of the original structure. The large-celled tissue consists in pai't of close-packed rounded or polygonal cells (Fig. 137 b), and in part of spindle-cells. There is but little intercellular substance, though in some spots distinct patches of fibrous tissue are seen. If the proper lymphadenoid tissue has not entirely disappeared, the re- maining portions of it form reticulated bands (a) pervading the large-celled tissue. The latter stains less deeply than the small cells of the normal lymphadenoid tissue. Fig. 137. Laege-celled hypeeplasia of a lymphatic gland. (Carmine staining : x 150) a remnants of lymphadenoid tissue b large-eeUed tissue c spindle-celled tissue The process of transformation begins with an accumulation of leucocytes in the gland-tissue, followed by the development of epithelioid cells with large nuclei. Only a few patches are formed at first, and these are cliiefly confined to the follicles and trabeculae, though they are also found in the lymph-sinuses. The develop- ment of the large cells can always be made apparent in sections by the use of staining reagents. The scattered patches then unite into more or less extensive ones, though at times the fusion is incomplete and the gland seems made up of isolated groups of large-celled nodules. We may thus distinguish a diffuse and a nodular variety of large-celled hyperplasia. The latter very much resembles tuberculous change, and the resemblance is occasionally increased by the occurrence of giant-cells Avithin the nodules (Art. 342). Hyperplastic glands of the kind described feel firm and dense, and may reach the size of a pigeon's egg, or even of a small hen's

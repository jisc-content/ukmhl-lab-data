CHAPTER LIV. THE INTESTINE. 463. Introductory, The intestinal part of the alimentary canal is that within which especially the assimilable parts of the food are absorbed, and so reach the lymphatics and blood-vessels. The intestine (according to some authorities) contains no new or specifically distinct variety of secreting glands, and its mucous membrane yields no specific secretions. On the other hand its absorbing surface is greatly increased by being thro\vn into a multitude of villi and valvular folds and tube-like crypts or pits. The epithelium consists throughout of a single layer of cylindrical cells, the blood-vessels and lymphatics extending up to the lower surface of the epithelium. The loose-textured connective tissue of the mucosa and submucosa expands at many points into a still looser reticulum, which contains lymphoid cells in abundance and so constitutes lymphadenoid tissue. This is aggregated into single nodules, the so-called solitary glands or follicles, or groups of these are agminated to form Peyer's patches. It is scarcely needful to point out that it is from the mucous surface that the intestine is most exposed to injury. Matters con- stantly pass into it from the stomach which react harmfully on its tissues, and the mucous membrane is the first part to be attacked. The normal contents, if they stagnate and so become altered in their physical or chemical characters, may give rise to various morbid conditions. In other cases Ave must assume that speci- fically noxious matters enter the canal from the mouth, and that these may be the cause of certain intestinal disorders. Many such disorders are probably due to specific bacteria, and in some of them these have been actually demonstrated. As regards the affections of the intestine which are traceable to the circulation, we need only remark that the intestinal mucous membrane like others is liable to oedema and haemorrhage in the

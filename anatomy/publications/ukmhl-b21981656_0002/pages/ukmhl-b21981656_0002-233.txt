CHAPTEE XLIII. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS. 414. The general structure of a mucous membrane is similar to that of the skin, and its surface is everywhere in continuity Avith the exterior- surface of the body. In textural details, however, there are considerable differences. The fibrous or reticular tissue (the mucosa) underlying the epithelial cells is looser and more cellular than the cutis : indeed in many parts it assumes the structure of lymphadenoid tissue and encloses a multitude of lymphoid elements in its meshes. The epithelial covering is thinner and more delicate than the epidermis, in some places consisting only of a siagle layer of juicy cylindrical cells; and even where the layers are numerous there is no protecting horny coveriag as in the case of the skin. The mucous membranes are all well supplied with blood-vessels and lymphatics, which extend up to the epithelial strata. The vessels , are in general continuous with those of the loose-textured and vascular submucous connective tissue (the submucosa). The submucosa is abundant in the mucous membranes of organs which are exposed to rapid and repeated changes of area and volume, and whose lining-membrane is consequently apt to be thrown into folds. In organs, like the uterus, which are not exposed to such sudden variations the submucosa is absent. The epithelial covering of the mucous membranes is highly permeable; so that liquids and small corpuscular bodies pass in from the outer surface, or pass out and are excreted from the blood-vessels. These matters pass partly between the epithelial cells, and partly through their substance. All the mucous membranes yield a secretion, which, apart from the liquid excreted from the vessels (usually small in amount), is characterised chiefly by the presence in it of mucus. The mucus is derived from certain of the epithelial cells, which elaborate it

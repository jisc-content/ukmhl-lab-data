The various forms of retrogressive change described in Arts. 32—71 may all of them affect the mucous structures. Necrosis occurs chiefly as the result of mechanical or chemical injury, and also of disorders of the circulation and inflammation. The changes produced are treated generally in Arts. 32—71, and with reference to particulars in Arts. 424—427. The issue of necrosis is always local inflammation and ulceration; repair takes place by regenerative growth, or by granulation and cicatrisation. In considering the various modes of degeneration it is con- venient to separate the changes in the epithelial elements from those in the fibrous tissues of the mucous membrane. The former show signs of degenerative change much more frequently than the latter. One of the commonest manifestations is an abnormal increase of the mucous secretion (catarrhal inflammation, Art. 420). Fatty degeneration of the epithelial cells is also common; and abnormal and premature desquamation plays a considerable part in certain of the inflammatory processes. The fibrous structures are especially liable to amyloid disease, especially in the intestine. The walls of the vessels are the favourite seat of the degenerative change. The fibrous structures are sometimes affected by mucoid and fatty degeneration, but they are much less liable to such changes than the epithelium. Atrophy of the mucous membrane, by which the epithelium is in part destroyed, is a condition of the greatest importance. In the alimentary canal the process can be followed in its most typical form: it is usually connected with or dependent on catarrhal inflammation. It will be remembered that the mucosa of the intestine is mainly composed of a glandular stratum containing lieberklihnian crypts with the underlying muscularis mucosae. The glandular

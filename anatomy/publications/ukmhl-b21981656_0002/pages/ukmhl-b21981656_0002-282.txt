CHAPTER LIII. THE STOMAOH. 452. Introductory. With the stomach begins the portion of the alimentary tract whose special function is the digestion and absorption of the ingested food. In accordance with this function we find the mucous membrane of the stomach furnished with numerous blood-vessels and lymphatics, a very thin epithelial covering, and an extraordinary number of glands yielding the juices necessary for digestion. The ingesta linger in the stomach for a considerable time; part is directly absorbed by the gastric mucous membrane, part is altered by the gastric digestion, and part passes on unaltered. It is easy to understand that—owing to the length of time during which the ingesta remain in the stomach, and the intimate nature of the relations between them and the mucous membrane —the latter is very liable to be injuriously affected by any noxious substance which may be swallowed. Thus the acids and alkalies which give rise to swelling and corrosion in the mouth, throat, and oesophagus (Art. 450) will in general act still more de- structively on the walls of the stomach. And other substances (like phosphorus, salicylic acid, etc.), which may pass through the upper parts of the tract without doing any harm, will be able in the stomach, where they lie for an appreciable time, to set up local or general inflammatory mischief. An excessive meal of ordinary food may have the latter effect, and of course substances in them- selves noxious or irritating will act more intensely. And although the stomach has the power of as it were protecting itself by the secretion of a thick coating of inert mucus, still this power has its limits and often enough is inadequate. The gastric mucous membrane is likewise exposed to danger from the side of the circulation. Apart from local or general

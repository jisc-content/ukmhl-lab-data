Haxit Berlin 1882 (the papillomata are thought to be due to cougeaital ueuritis, the proximate cause being distm-bauce of the vaso-motor mechanism). BosTROM some time ago {Sitzungsher. d. phys.-ined. Qesell. zu Erlangen 1880) described a case in which every three or four months the horny epidermis of the hand was shed in the form of a glove. This was preceded by intense redness of the skiu, and coincided in time with a menstrual period. The affection was therefore not improbably due to vaso-motor distm-bance. 398. Warts and moles. The skin is the seat of certain peculiar formations, which are characterised by the presence of nests and clusters of epithelioid cells. They affect the cutis chiefly, and appear at birth or in the first ten or twenty years of life. Fig. 157. Section a?HBODGH two papillae raoM a cutaneous wabt.

They lie in the lower reticular layers of the cutis or in the papillae, and are separated by vascular connective tissue: but there are neither vessels nor fibrous tissue

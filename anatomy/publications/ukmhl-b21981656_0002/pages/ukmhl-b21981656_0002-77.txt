CHAPTER XI. INFECTIVE GRANULOMATA, TUMOURS, AND PARASITES OF THE HEART. 285. Tubercle is the commonest of the gramilomata affecting the heart; syphiloma is more rare. In acute miliary tuberculosis the heart does not escape the general invasion; but it is much less common to find larger caseous nodules in its substance. When they do occur it is almost invariably in connexion with like caseous nodules in the pericardium. Gummata are very rare. They lie in the wall of the heart embedded in dense hyperplastic fibrous tissue; and according to their age appear as soft reddish or greyish patches, or as dry yellow cheesy nodes. Simple inflam- matory indurations of the heart-muscle occur as a consequence of congenital or acquired syphilis, and these are more common than gummata. Of the true tumours several kinds may attack the heart primarily, such as sarcoma, fibroma, lipoma, myxoma, and myoma; but they are all of them rare. Secondary tumours are more frequently found, especially secon- dary carcinomata. The tumour-germs, other than those that seize upon the heart from the pericardium, reach the heart-muscle through the circulation. The growths may be seated in the substance of the wall, or may protrude into the cavities, or into the pericardial sac. Occasionally tumours attack the heart by continuity from the mediastinum, the oesophagus, or the stomach. The effect of such tumours on the heart will of course depend on their seat and size. If large they may interfere seriously with its action. Thrombi readily form on tumours which project into the cavities. Softening and ulceration of new growths may lead to rupture of the heart. Of parasites Cysticercus and Echinococcus are found in the heart. Echinococcus (hydatids) may lead to its rupture. For references see Orth's Lehrb. d. spec. path. Anat. vol. i Berlin 1883.

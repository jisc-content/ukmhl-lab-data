157 CHAP. XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. where the exudation is sudden and abundant. When the inflam- mation is loss acute, and the injury to the epidermis less extensive than it is in burns, the vesicles or blebs are formed more gradually. Thus the erysipelatous inflammation of the skin, which follows upon the lodgement in its lymphatics of certain micrococci (Fig. 146 h i k), is characterised by primary cellular infiltration (?n) of the corium and papillae. When the exudation reaches the epidermal layers the cells (/) begin to swell up; they then become vacuolated, that is to say drops of liquid (e) distend them and displace their protoplasm and nucleus. If several vacuoles are formed simultaneously ^vithin the same cell, the protoplasm is reduced to a kind of mesh-work {g), in which however the nucleus can generally be detected. At length the protoplasm dissolves Fig. 147. Section through a vesicle of hekpes zostek. {From lUWHT, Sitzimgsher. cl. k.

THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES. [sect. VI. 216 specks of ecchymosis and the mingling of a few red corpuscles with the ordinary secretion; or so abundant that the membrane itself is soaked with blood, which at the same time pours away from the free surface. Excessive haemorrhages of this kind often occur without any perceptible cause, especially in persons congenitally predisposed to bleeding (Art. 28). Many persons are particularly subject to bleeding from the nasal mucous membrane; others bleed from the surface of the large or small intestine or from the bladder, sometimes to such an extent that death ensues. Congestion, thrombosis, embolism, wounds, disease of the vessels, may any of them give rise to haemorrhage, and some of the inflammations of the mucous membrane are apt to assume a haemorrhagic character, or at least to be accompanied by extravasations of blood. Such extravasations may be due to diapedesis or to actual rupture of the vessels. The consequences of haemorrhage are various : small extravasa- tions are re-absorbed, but often (as in the intestine) leave behind slaty or black discolorations vs^hich may persist for a long time. Frequently the tissue infiltrated with blood necroses and breaks down; erosions and ulcers are thus produced, which at times reach a considerable size. After extensive haemorrhage, such as results from intense and enduring engorgement, large and continuous portions of the tissue may perish, and gangrene not uncommonly sets in.

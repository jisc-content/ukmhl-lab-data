CHAPTER LX. INFLAMMATIONS OF THE LIVER. Furulent hepatitis and Hepatic abscess. 493. Purulent inflammation of the liver depends on the invasion of the organ by some noxious or irritant body derived either from the exterior or from some other part of the system. The information we now possess concerning the genesis of the suppurative process justifies us in believing that as a rule this imtant is a bacterium or is produced by the agency of bacteria. Only in very peculiar and unlikely conditions can any other agent (such as the Actinomyces) give rise to suppuration within the liver. The avenues by which micro-organisms may enter the liver are numerous. They may enter directly from without in the case of a perforating wound of the liver through the belly-wall, and cause the wound to suppurate. A purulent inflammation of any of the neighbouring organs or tissues may extend to the liver by con- tinuity, or through the channel of the lymphatics. More commonly however the micro-organisms reach the liver through the blood. The portal vein is the most frequent channel, though the hepatic artery may also convey infection. Rarely, and only in very exceptional circumstances, can anything of the kind pass with the venous blood from the vena cava into the hepatic veins. Lastly, in infants the patent umbilical vein may convey infection to the liver. Infection of the liver by these channels is commonly secondary ; that is, it depends upon a preceding lodgement of bacteria some- where withia the territory supplied by the blood-vessels in question. Thus abscess of the liver is not infrequently the result of purulent inflammation (dysentery) of the intestine, infection being conveyed by the portal vein; or it may follow upon a suppurating wound of the head for example, the channel of infection being the hepatic artery. In the latter case the virulent material must have passed 21â€”2

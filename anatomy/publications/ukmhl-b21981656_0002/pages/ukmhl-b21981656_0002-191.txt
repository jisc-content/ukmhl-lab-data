CHAP. XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. m being generally accompanied by the formation of plates, scales, and flakes, an appearance recalling that of elephantiasis combined with ichthyosis is produced (Arts. 394, 396 and 413). So long as the inflammation persists the hypertrophied fibrous tissue is thickly beset with clusters of young leucocytes. They are occasionally aggregated into nodules containing giant-cells. 386. The pustular syphilide follows upon the papular form (Art. 379) by the development of pustules above the papules. Small pustular and large pustular varieties may be distinguished. The latter are often described as syphilitic variola, acne, or impetigo. The pustules are surrounded by a red infiltrated raised border. When the papules and pustules grow to any considerable size the eruption is described as pemphigus syjjhiliticus, and when these harden into crusts they form riipia syphilitica. The syphilitic pemphigus of infants (Fig. 152) calls for special mention. It occurs chiefly on the limbs of infants suffering Fia. 152. Infantile syphilitic pemphigus.

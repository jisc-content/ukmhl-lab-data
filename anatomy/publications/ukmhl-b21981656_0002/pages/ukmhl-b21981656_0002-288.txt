[sect. VII. 268 THE ALIMENTAKY TRACT. Ulcers of this extent are rare as a consequence of simple inflammation. Like the round or perforating gastric ulcer (Art. 459) they may give rise to serious haemorrhage. A more common result is pigmentary change in the mucous membrane, with glandular atrophy and fibrous hyperplasia (atrophic pigmentary induration). The pigmentation is usually grey, and is due to the presence of minute black granules derived from small extravasations of blood. The atrophy appears in the thinning of the mucous membrane, which may be marked enough to be visible by the unaided eye; in slighter cases it can be demonstrated under the microscope. When the fibrous hyperplasia is on the whole but slight, it seems to be confined to the interglandular connective tissue (Fig. 175 a). In more advanced cases the mucous membrane is increased in its entire thickness, and rises in folds (d) and warty or polypous excrescences. The surface thus becomes rough and connigated, and the condition is known as the etat mamelonne, or polyposis ventriculi (Art. 422). Tig. 175.

Some of the glands lose their epithelium and disappear, others take the form of cysts. These cysts, which vary in size from that of a small pea to that of a bean, contain a clear viscid liquid mingled with granular detritus and

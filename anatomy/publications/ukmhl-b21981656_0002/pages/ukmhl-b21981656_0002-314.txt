Tuberculosis of the intestine has already been con- sidered in Art. 428, so far at least as the minuter tuberculous tissue-changes are concerned. It is one of the commonest of intes- tinal diseases, and chiefly attacks the lymphadenoid structures. The neighbourhood of the ileo-caecal valve is the region most fre- quently affected, but often enough the whole of the large intestine down to the anus becomes tuberculous. At first a little nodule covered with epithelium iDrotrudes from the surface of a Payer's patch or over a solitary follicle. After a time the centre of the nodule becomes pale-yellow, indicating that necrosis and caseation have begun. The caseous parts break down and a tuberculous ulcer (Fig. 179 h) with infiltrated borders is formed. The ulcer is minute, but soon enlarges as it coalesces with others formed in like manner, while new foci of disintegi'ation appear in its gradually advancing borders. a mucosa b submucosa c internal muscular coat d external muscular coat e serous coat / solitary follicle FlO. 179.

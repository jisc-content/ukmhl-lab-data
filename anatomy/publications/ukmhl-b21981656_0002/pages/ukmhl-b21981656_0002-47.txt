CHAPTER V. SOLID IMPURITIES IN THE BLOOD. 263. The morbid changes in the blood just discussed (Arts. 257â€”262) are all liable to produce more or less transitory pollution of the blood. Disintegi-ated corpuscles, such as are common after bums, can only be regarded as impurities which have to be eliminated; and so too the pigment-granules of melanaemia, and the crumbled fragments of softening thrombi, are matters foreign to healthy blood. They have this in common that they are the products of morbid changes in the blood itself The minute groups of granules seen in some cases of anaemia are probably of the same nature; RiESS {Reichert's Arch. 1872) thinks they are disintegrated white cells, Leube (Berl. klin. Woch. 44, 1879) regards them as broken-down haematoblasts, Bizzozero (Arch, ital. de hiologie i) as broken-down blood-plates. Morbid changes in the vessel-wall may introduce impurities as well as changes in the blood itself For instance, in some infective fevers the vascular endothelium becomes fatty and is shed into the blood-current. When the lining membrane of the heart or great vessels becomes inflamed it is not uncommon for fragments of diseased tissue to be swept off in like manner. Fatty or necrotic patches in the lining membrane are also very apt to contribute impurities to the blood; it is thus that fragments of necrosed valves, of inflammatory exudations, and of fatty detritus enter the circulation. 264. Impurities derived from the tissues are frequently conveyed by various channels into the blood. The lymphatic system is one channel, and solid matters may be taken up and carried along by the lymph-current directly. More commonly such matters are first taken up by contractile cells which act as carriers. Thus the products of disintegration of extravasated blood are carried off by corpuscle-carrying cells, and the pro-

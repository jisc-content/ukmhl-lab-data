CHAPTER XVI. CHANGES IN THE CALIBRE OF THE VESSELS. 301. A true aneurysm is a localised dilatation of an artei*y involving all three of its coats. When the dilatation has persisted for a time one or other of the coats may atrophy; the media being the first to disappear, while the intima often follows. In this way the wall of the aneurysm may ultimately in places consist of the adventitia alone. When the dilatation extends over a considerable section of the artery, when for instance the entire thoracic aorta is uniformly dilated while retaining its cylindrical form, we have a diffuse or cylindrical aneurysm; a spindle-shaped dilatation constitutes a fusi- form aneurysm; a localised unilateral bulging is a sacculated aneurysm: while an artery with some of its branches which is dilated and convoluted, and it may be in parts sacculated, is described as a cirsoid aneurysm (or less aptly an aneurysmal varix, which term has properly another signification. Art. 311). The forms just mentioned may of course be combined in various ways, so that intermediate and transitional varieties are common. In the case of sacculated aneurysms the diameter of the opening into the sac is often less than that of the sac itself. The racemose or anastomotic aneurysm (otherwise described as an arterial vascular tumour) is a distinct variety. Here, as has been mentioned in Arts. 151 and 289, we have to do with a general dilatation of a multitude of arterial twigs and capillaries accompanied by hypertrophy of their walls. Abnormal width of the arteries generally, apai't from localised or aneurysmal change, may occur as a congenital or at least de- velopmental anomaly. 302. The development of an aneurysm is in general to be referred to some pre-existent disease of the arterial coats. Saccu- lations are especially apt to occur when the intima and media are

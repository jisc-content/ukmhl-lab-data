345 CHAP. LXI.] PAEASITES OF THE LIVEE. Anatomy; here we propose merely to add something concerning the echinococcus or hydatid of the liver. A hydatid has usually the form of a simple cyst, of the size of a walnut or larger. The wall is composed of an inner chitinous layer and an outer fibrous one, the latter being sometimes re- markably thickened. If the echinococcus is alive the cyst contains a clear liquid, and the inner surface is covered with a whitish parenchymatous layer, on which are seated small white brood-capsules containing scolices (Art. 245). Cases in which the mother-cyst is accompanied by internal or external daughter-cysts are less common. By the time the liver comes to be examined the hydatid is usually dead, and the liquid wholly or partially absorbed. In this case the chitinous capsule is shrunken and folded, and contains a white cheesy, pulpy, or mortar-like and calcareous mass. In this the characteristic booklets can often be discovered lying loosely. When the cysts reach a large size they may burst into the neighbouring parts, for example, into the peritoneum or intestine, or externally; sometimes inflammation is set up around the cysts. Echinococcus viultilocularis, giving rise to what was formerly described as 'alveolar colloid' of the liver, is a peculiar variety described in Art. 247.

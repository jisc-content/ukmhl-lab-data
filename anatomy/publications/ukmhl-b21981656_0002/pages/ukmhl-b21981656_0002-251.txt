CHAP. XLVII.] INFECTIVE QRANULOMATA AND TUMOURS. 281 In the mucous membrane of the bronchi and bladder the tuberculous growths do not attain any large size. In the larynx, glottis, and epiglottis the sub-epithelial granulomatous tissue may sprout into fungous growths resembling exactly the fungating granulomata of bone (Art. 121). The epithelium is thereby raised into warty excrescences, and when they break down more or less extensive ulcers are produced. Fig. 173. Tubebculosis of the laege intestine.

The tubercles (Fig. 173 i are seated chiefly in the submucosa; the cellular infiltrations of the mucosa are less definitely aggregated. When the tubercles break down cavities are formed in the submucosa (/i,), which we may call tuberculous abscesses, and these gradually extend into and through the mucosa and ultimately form open ulcers on the surface Qi). The tuberculous ulcer when once formed usually advances by progressive disintegration of its infiltrated margins. The in- filtration of cells and their aggregation into tubercles being very irregular in their course (Fig. 173), the process of disintegration is

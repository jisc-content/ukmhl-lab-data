338 [sect. VIII. THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. The nodules when recent consist of simple aggregations of small cells (Fig. 196 b); when more advanced they contain giant-cells; when ' mature' the central cells are denucleated and necrotic. The most recent tubercles exactly resemble foci of simple in- flammatory infiltration. The eruption of nodules is not infrequently accompanied by a diffuse and somewhat extensive cellular infiltra- tion of the liver generally. Nodules of larger size are as a rule manifestly made up of smaller nodules. As the tubercles become mature the infiltrated liver-tissue in which they are seated becomes necrosed and the cells are trans- formed into shapeless denucleated blocks. The bile-ducts sometimes perish in like manner. When they are surrounded or enclosed by tubercles the epithelial cells, especially when they coalesce or fuse together, may simulate giant-cells. According to Arnold new bile- ducts may be formed in the midst of a tuberculous nodule, as in non-tuberculous interstitial hepatitis (Art. 497). In the second form of tuberculosis, or chronic tuberculous hepatitis, there is not onty an eruption of nodules but also a diffuse fibrous hyperplasia of the liver. Its tissue is traversed by more or less dense bands of fibrous tissue, containing small grey tubercles or larger yellow or bile-stained caseous patches. When these reach a considerable size they break down and cavities are formed, which enclose liquid or pulpy bile-stained detritus. Cases occur in which the entire organ is honeycombed with innumerable cavities varying in size from that of a pea to that of a walnut; but such cases are rare. Large caseous nodes, resembling the solitary tubercles of the brain, are also rare. References :â€”J. Arnold, Virch. Arch. vol. 80; Orth, ibid. vol. 60.

CHAPTER XLVII. INFECTIVE GRANULOMATA AND TUMOURS. 428. Tuberculosis of the mucous membranes is one of the commonest of all diseases. In post-mortem examinations we generally meet with it in the form of tuberculous ulceration, but oj)portunities often occur for studying the process in its early stages. It begins as a cellular infiltration of the sub-epithelial tissue, which is either localised in definite nodules, or diffusely scattered with here and there slightly-marked aggregations. If there are any lymph-follicles in the tissue the infiltrated cells tend to accumulate round them. The smallest nodules of all have often no very characteristic appearance, but they occasionally contain giant-cells. Caseation usually sets in early (c). The Fig. 172.

Disintegration speedily follows ; the sub-epithelial nodules break through the epithelium, and rounded or sinuous ulcers of various sizes (Figs. 172 d and 173 h) are formed. The floor and margins of such ulcers are infiltrated with cells, the surface portions being necrotic. Tubercles are often but not always found seated in the infiltrated zone.

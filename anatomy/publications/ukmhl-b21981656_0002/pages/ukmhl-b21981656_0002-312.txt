THE ALIMENTAEY TRACT. 292 [sect. VII. The swelling of the patches and follicles is chiefly due to the extreme cellular infiltration of the mucosa (Fig. 178 and Fig. 178.

The glands (/) of the mucosa are thereby thrust asunder and displaced, and the villi are likewise infiltrated and swollen. The submucosa underlying the patches is uniformly infiltrated (6,). In the earlier stages the several follicles (g) within the infiltrated region are still distinct and recognisable, but they are presently merged and lost in the general assemblage of lymphoid cells and leucocytes, extravasated and other. The muscular and serous coats (Cj are also invaded by the extravasated cells, though in a less marked degree. The number of swollen patches and follicles varies much. Often but a small number or even a single one is markedly affected; while in other cases the affection extends upwards to the jejunum or downwards to the anus. In the second week of the disease partial disintegration and necrosis of the swollen patches usually sets in. The disintegration attacks the whole of the central part of the patch, or two or more parts of it simultaneously. The surface quickly assumes a frayed or ragged appearance, and becomes yellow or brown from the action of the bile. Gradually the disintegrated tissue or slough

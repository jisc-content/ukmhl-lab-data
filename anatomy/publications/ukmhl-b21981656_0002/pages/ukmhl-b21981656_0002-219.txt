CHAPTER XLI. AFFECTIONS OF THE SEBACEOUS GLANDS, HAIR, AND NAILS. 403. Disorders of the sebaceous secretion. In normal conditions the epithelium of the sebaceous glands secretes a small quantity of oily liquid, which becomes condensed in the gland or in its duct to a semi-fluid grease-like substance containing disinteg- rated cells. If the secretion becomes over-abiindant we have what is called seborrhoea or steatorrhoea, with its consequences which go by the various names of tinea furfuracea, acne sebacea, ichthyosis sebacea, etc. According as the secretion dries into scales and crusts or remains liquid and oily we have seborrhoea sicca, squamosa, furfihracea, or seborrhoea oleosa. The scales and crusts are often dirty and discoloured, and occasionally form broad greasy scabs or lamellae, from the under side of which processes pass into the openings of the sebaceous ducts. Seborrhoea may be local or general. The local variety chiefly affects the scalp and the external genitals. General seborrhoea is rare, and is usually met with only in new-born infants; the abundant secretion of vernix caseosa which is normal in the intra-uterine period is in fact continued after birth. The abundant sebaceous secretion from the glands of the scalp which is normal during the first year of life sometimes gives rise, in neglected infants, to large fissured dirty cheesy-looking crusts or cakes, consisting of fatty matter, dirt, epidermal scales, and hairs. Seborrhoea often alfects enfeebled or anaemic patients. The skin of the trunk and limbs becomes covered with dry glistening scales, whence the affection is sometimes referred to as pityriasis tabescentiiom. When the scalp only is affected, the dried secretion taking the form of abundant branny scales, the affection is called dandrifif or pityriasis furfuracea capillitii; when the scales are large and thick it is sometimes called ichthyosis sebacea.

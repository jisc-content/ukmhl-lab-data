108 THE SPLEEN AND THE LYMPHATKI GLANDS. [SECT. IIL pigmentation of the bronchial glands by matters inhaled with the air as dust. When blue or red colours have been used in tatooing the skin, the glands which receive the corresponding lymphatics are often found after a time to contain some of the insoluble pigment. See ViRCHOW {Celhdar-pathologie 4th ed. p. 224, Virch. Arch. vol. 35), Billroth {Beitrcige z. path. Hist. (1858) p. 135, Virch. Arch. vol. 21), Rebsamen {Virch. Arch. vol. 24), Orth {Virch.

The consequences of foreign deposit in the glands depend on its amount and on its physico-chemical nature. Many substances, such as calcium carbonate, are dissolved; others like coal- dust, stone-dust, or cinnabar remain and lead to permanent pig- mentation. They lie enclosed in lymphoid cells (Fig. 136 c), or Fig. 136. Section of a slate-coloured buonchial gland.

If the amount present is small the changes induced are trifling; larger amounts lead to the shrinking of the gland. The lymphoid elements dwindle and disappear, while the meshes of the reticulum become filled Avith pigment-carrying cells (Fig. 136 c and c') and free pigment. The reticulum may be unaltered, or in part hyperplastic (a), in which case it is made up of juicy branching and anastom- osing cells. Dense fibrillated connective tissue (6) is often formed in places, and this too contains pigment. Chemically active substances have of coiirse a very different effect, as also such living micro-organisms as may reach the glands. They usually set up more or less violent inflammation, and not infrequently lead to necrosis.

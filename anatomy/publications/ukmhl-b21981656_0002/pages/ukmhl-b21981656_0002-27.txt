CHAPTER II. INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION OR THROMBOSIS. 252. We have already seen (Art. 35) that when blood dies it usually coagulates, that is to sayâ€”solid masses of fibria are formed in the plasma, the masses consisting of granules or granular fibrils or homogeneous flakes. When coagulation occurs within the vessels during life the process is called thrombosis, and the coagulum is called a thrombus. On Schmidt's hypothesis the coagulation of the blood depends on the union of two albuminoid bodies, fibrinogen and fibrino- plastin (or paraglobulin), in presence of a third factor or ferment (Art. 35). Taking the fibrinogen as furnished by the plasma, and the other factors as furnished by the colourless elements of the blood, coagulation is evidence of the death of the latter in whole or in part. Coagulation may take place in blood which is at rest, or in blood which is in motion ; and the appearance of the thrombus is different in the two cases. In blood at rest coagulation takes place throughout the entire mass simultaneously. The thrombus is thus dark-red or brown in colour, and consists of granular and fibrous clots of fibrin containing multitudes of red corpuscles and a few white corpuscles. Red thrombi of this kind are most commonly formed in occluded or highly engorged vessels. When recent they are soft and full of serum. Afterwards they become firmer, tougher, and drier, the fibrin contracting and squeezing out the serum. They become at the same time paler and greyer; the decolorisation proceeds in fact by the same steps as in extravasated blood (Art. 68). When coagulation begins in blood which is still flowing, the entire mass does not coagulate at once; minute flakes separate out, consisting chiefly (according to Zahn) of white blood-cells with a varying number of red blood-cells. According to the number and arrangement of these latter the thrombus may be white or grey, or pale reddish, or mottled and stratified.

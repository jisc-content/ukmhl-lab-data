46 THE VASCULAR MECHANISM. [sect. II. section through a degenerating muscular bundle. In the upper part the muscle-cells are still unaltered and present the ordinary appearance (a). In the middle the cells (b) are beginning to break Fig. 124. myomalacia cordis. {Section through a degenerating muscular bundle: double staining with haematoxylin and carmine : x 300) a normal muscle-cell d non-nuclear fibrous tissue b disintegrating muscle-cell e normal nucleus of muscle-ceU c completely degenerate miiscle-cell e^ swoUen nucleus resolved into granular detritus up into fragments, while below (c) they are completely disintegrated into granular detritus. The destruction is often limited to the muscle-cells, but at times the connective tissue likewise suffers ; in such cases the nuclei cease to take up colour when the section is stained {d), and gTanules are deposited among the pale fibrils of the connective tissue. When haemorrhage occurs as an accompaniment, we may find entire or fragmentary blood-cells mingled with the connective tissue and in part replacing the disintegrated muscle-cells ; and in later stages the tissue will contain pigment-granules. When the destructive process has gone a certain length, and death does not ensue, processes of repair are set up. The detritus is re-absorbed and carried off, and the gap filled up by scar-tissue. Migratory leucocytes pass out of the vessels, and reactive inflamma- tion begins. The detritus is for the most part taken up by these migratory cells, in part also taken up by the vessels directly or in solution. Ultimately fibrous tissue developes from the granulation- tissue built u-p by the leucocytes and perhaps by the multiplication

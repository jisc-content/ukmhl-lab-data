CHAPTER XLIV. HYPERAEMIA AND HAEMORRHAGE. 415. Congestive hyperaemia. Many of the mucous mem- branes are physiologically subject to periodic hyperaemia. The blood-supply of the alimentary canal during digestion, and of the uterus during menstruation, is very strikingly increased. The increase is governed by vaso-motor influences transmitted through the nerves, in obedience to which the afferent arteries are dilated, and so convey more blood to the parts. Morbid influences may likewise give rise to hyperaemia, either by paralysing the vaso-constrictor, or stimulating the vaso-dilator nerves. The morbid stimuli may act on the central nervous system, or, by reflex action, on the mucous membrane itself. The swallowing of hot food makes the stomach hyperaemic; the inhalation of irritating vapours or the act of rubbing the eyelid will determine blood to the bronchi or the conjunctiva respectively. A mucous membrane when hyperaemic becomes intensely reddened, and the distended vessels can be distinguished on close examination. At the same time the secretion becomes more abundant, often visibly so after the congestion has lasted a little time. Passive hyperaemia or engorgement usually gives rise to livid redness; but if the membrane is exposed to the air (as in the case of the lungs) the tint may be almost arterial. Long-continued venous engorgement frequently leads to abiding varicose dilatation of the veins. Tf oedema results from the engorgement, the mem- brane usually swells up and assumes a sodden appearance. Where the submucosa is loose and open (as in the intestine) the swelling is sometimes very remarkable, the transuded liquid collecting in great abundance in the meshes of the tissue. 416. Haemorrhages occur very frequently in the mucous membranes. They may be slight, giving rise merely to minute

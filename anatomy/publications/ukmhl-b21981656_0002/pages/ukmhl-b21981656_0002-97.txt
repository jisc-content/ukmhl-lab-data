CHAP. XVI.] CAPILLAEY ECTASIS. 77 thrombi, leading to the development of fibrous tissue; but the thrombi never undergo complete organisation. These somewhat incoherent thrombi form but an imperfect defence against the danger of rupture, as the blood may work its way between the thrombus and the vessel-wall; while the thrombi themselves may undergo softening, disintegration, or even lique- faction : occasionally calcareous salts are deposited and they become calcified. Charcot asserts {Smile and chronic diseases 1881) that cerebral haemor- rhage always depends on the ruptiu-e of an aneurysm more or less minute. EiCHLER (beutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med. xxii), Zenker {Natm-forscherversamm. 1872), and Roth (Corresp. f. schweiz. Aerzte 1874) admit that aneurysms are very generally fouud in such cases. But they are occasionally absent, and the truth probably is that they are a frequent but not an invariable cause of apoplectic haemorrhage.

Dilatation of the capillaries is usually referred to as capillary ectasis when it is general; more localised dilatations are called capillary aneurysms. Ectasis chiefly occurs as a result of chronic disorders of the circulation which lead to over-distension of the capillaries with blood; in other words as a result of long- standing congestion or engorgement.

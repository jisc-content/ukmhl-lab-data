BLOOD AND LYMPH. [sect. I. 12 infiltration appearing in the outer and middle coats (Fig. 118 e), as well as in the inner coat (/). Presently migratoiy cells begin to accumulate, partly within the lumen of the vessel {g), partly within the substance of the thrombus, and partly between the latter and the vessel-wall. The first cells which migrate are small and round, and their nuclei are strongly stained by colouring- reagents. Presently larger cells appear, with clear vesicular nuclei (A); these have been developed out of the migratory cells. They are of various forms, rounded, elongated, or ramified (A). These Fig. 118.

When they have multiplied sufficiently, so that they become contiguous, they are gradually transformed into fibrous tissue. New blood-vessels are simultaneously developed, and at length the new-formed tissue is vascularised throughout. This is the general course of the process; but considerable variation may take place in details. Thus if the thrombus result from ligature, in a young and healthy patient, the accumulation of leucocytes will be much more marked than in such a case as is represented in Fig. 118: in this case the patient was old, and his arteries had already undergone a certain amount of morbid change.

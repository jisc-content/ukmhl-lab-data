327 CHAP. LX.] CHEONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER. various channels. Of these channels the blood-vessels are the chief, though the bile-ducts also are very often at fault; in other words the disease is most frequently haematogenous, though instances of what we may call biliary hepatitis are by no means uncommon. As to the exact nature of the noxious influences or agents we know little. It is possible that in many or in most cases irritant matters absorbed from the alimentary canal are especially concerned. By many authorities alcohol is considered to be one of the most important of the exciting factors. In other cases syphilis is admittedly the cause. Indurative inflammation of the liver is always a chronic and at the same time a very gradual and insidious affection. It is rare for an acute hepatitis to pass into a chronic one of this type. The first stages of the affection are marked by the presence of a more or less obvious infiltration of the liver-tissue with leucocytes. Fig. 188, Eeoent intekstitial hepatitis. {Haematoxylin staining: x 80) a normal liver-tissue b interlobular connective tissue infiltrated with leucocytes The infiltration is chiefly seen in the interlobular connective tissue (Fig._ 188 b), and thence extends into the lobules. The infiltration is usually at first in the form of disconnected patches of various sizes. Less commonly it is uniformly diffused. From the extravasated cells new fibrous tissue is gradually elabora,ted by the development of fibroblasts, that is to say of large cells with clear vesicular nuclei (Fig. 189 d). When the process extends to the lobules leucocytes accumulate within the lobular capillaries (Fig. 189 b and Fig. 190), and from them are developed fibroblasts (Fig. 190) and ultimately fibrous tissue.

25 CHAP. IV.] CHANGES IN THE BLOOD-COEPUSCLES. EngKsh work on the subject see Wilks, Bi-it. med. Journ. 2, 1874; Taylur, Guy's Hosp. Rep. 1878 ; Coupland, Gulstonian Lectures, Lancet 1, 1881 ; HoBSON, Practitioner xxx (1883). The genesis of oligocythaemia is referable partly to excessive consumption, partly to defective production, of the red corpuscles. As regards the latter many authors maintain that white corpuscles are transformed into red by the development in them of haemoglobin. Some hold that the transformation occurs within the blood as it circulates, others that it is confined to the spleen and bone-marrow. The transformation (say they) is effected by the disap- pearance of the nucleus, the rounding and flattening of the cell, and the gi-adual deposition in it of haemoglobin. In support of this view the occurrence of nucleated red corpuscles is insisted on. Quite recently these assumptions have been assailed by various investi- gators, and a different account has been given of the genesis of red corpuscles. Hayem makes out that they arise from his ' haematoblasts,' which are pinkish, yellowish, greenish, or sometimes colourless biconcave discs, without nuclei, and measming 1—4 micromm. across. These discs are formed in the protoplasm of the lymph-corpuscles, and are shed by the latter before they reach the blood. Cadet and Pouchet give a like account, though the latter believes that nucleated red corpuscles are produced by direct transformation from leucocytes. Malassez and Foa say that they are foi-med out of cells budded off from the nucleated ceUs of the bone- marrow. EiNDFLEiscH fiuds that nucleated red haematoblasts are formed in the mari'ow, which subdivide and produce daughter-cells; from these the nucleus is extruded and the remainder becomes a red corpuscle. Bizzozero denies the accuracy of Hatem's observations and holds that the latter's 'haematoblasts' are nothing but his own blood-plates (Art. 252), which have nothing to do with the production of red corpuscles. He asserts that after birth nucleated red blood-cells appear in the bone-marrow, which are really yoimg corpuscles, and increase by subdivision. The division of the nucleus is accompanied by the formation of karyolytic figures. In early foetal life this process of multiplication takes place throughout the entire vasculai' system ; towards the close of foetal life the process is restricted to the liver and spleen, and after birth to the bone-marrow. Neumann takes up a like position. Like Rindpleisch, Bizzozero states that the nucleus escapes from these young corpuscles, while Fol assumes that it disappears. References ;—Bizzozero, Gaz. med.

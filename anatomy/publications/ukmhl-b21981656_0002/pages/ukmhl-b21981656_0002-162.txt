THE SKIN. [sect. V, 142 another reason against the classification of skin-diseases according to their causes alone. In the following chapters we shall classify the diseases of the skin in the main according to the histological changes which they involve. Aetiology will be appealed to as a subsidiary principle of classification in affections where (as in parasitic disease) the exciting cause either is itself amenable to microscopical investiga- tion, or always induces the same specific textural change. The histological mode of classification cannot of course be always carried out with perfect strictness. The above-mentioned fact— that the same morbid change may be produced in various ways and may thus appear as a stage in various distinct morbid processes— obliges us now and then to have regard to the general clinical course of a disease as well as to its histology. And as in the case of the skin we can follow without difficulty the evolution and progress of the morbid processes, and so ascertain that the same phase of textural change is not always associated with the same disease (as indicated by its clinical course), we are constrained to modify somewhat the subdivision of the suljject which mere patho- logical anatomy would suggest.

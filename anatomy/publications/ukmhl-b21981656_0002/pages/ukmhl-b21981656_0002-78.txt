CHAPTER XII. HYPOPLASIA AND DEGENERATION OF THE VESSELS. 286. A blood-vessel consists essentially of an endothelial tnbe ; but all vessels above a certain size have their endothelial walls strengthened by the addition of connective tissue, elastic tissue, and muscle-cells; and all again above a somewhat larger size have nutrient vessels of their own, the so-called vasa vasorum. The diseases of the vessels are processes affecting the vessel- walls alone, or the vessel-walls with the surrounding tissue; or they may form merely a part of some general affection of the parenchyma of the organs through which the vessels run. The latter is especially the case with the smaller vessels embedded in the substance of the organs. The malformations of the vessels which have clinical importance have already been referred to in treating of the mal- formations of the heart. Here we need refer again only to the condition of general under-growth or hypoplasia of the vessels associated with chlorosis, and characterised by abnormal nar- rowness of the channels and thinness of the walls, especially of the greater arteries. The very frequent anomalies of position, course, and distribution which are met with in arteries and veins are treated of in text-books of normal anatomy. According to Beneke (Die anat. Grundlagen d. Constitutions-anomaliemi Marburg 1878) the circumference of the ascending aorta in a new-bom infant is 20 mm., in an adult 68 mm.; the pulmonary artery measuring 23 mm. and 65 mm. in the two cases respectively. Above the bifurcation of tlie abdomi- nal aorta the circumference in the adult measm-es 32 mm. 287. Simple atrophy of the walls of arteries and veins is observed in connexion with general marasmus and atrophy of indi- vidual organs. After amputation of a limb the vascular trunks of the stump usually become smaller. Instead however of this simple and uncomplicated atrophy we more often find evidence of partial

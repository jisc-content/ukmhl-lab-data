CHAPTER LXI. TUMOURS AND PARASITES OF THE LIVER. Primary tumoitrs. 502. Both epithelial and connective-tissue tumours occur in the liver, but rarely as primary growths. Of the epithelial tumours adenoma must first be considered, though it is a decidedly rare affection. It takes the form of multiple nodules, from the size of a millet-seed to that of a cherry, and greyish or yellowish or reddish on section. The smallest nodules are continuous with the surrounding liver-tissue, the larger ones are enclosed in a fibrous capsule and frequently undergo a process of internal softening. When the adenomatous nodules are numerous the liver becomes greatly enlarged, and its surface is beset with rounded protuberances. Only one case is recorded (Greenfield) in which the tumour had given rise to metastatic growths. The nodules consist of convoluted and anastomosing glandular tubes resembling the convoluted tubules of the kidney, and em- bedded in a framework of vascular fibrous tissue. According to RINDFLEISCH these tubes are developed from the cylindrical columns or trabeculae of the liver-cells; the cells being supposed to multiply abnormally and to group themselves into tubular clusters. As the smaller nodules increase in size, fresh liver-cells are drawn into the growth, and the tubes already developed throw out fresh off-shoots and branches. References :—Griesinger, Arch. d.

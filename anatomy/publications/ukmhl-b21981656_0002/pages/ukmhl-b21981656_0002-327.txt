CHAP. LV.] PIGMENTARY INFILTRATION OF THE LIVER. 307 The presence of these iron-compounds in the liver can be ex- plained only by supposing that the excretion of the products of blood-disintegration through the liver cannot keep pace with the supply. The accumulation is favoured by the fact that the action of the liver itself is impaired in consequence of the general anaemia. In extreme cases the liver-cells become fatty as well as pigmented, and exhibit multitudes of very minute oil-globules interspersed through their substance (Fig. 181 b). The liver-cells may be affected injuriously by alterations in the composition of the blood, other than those due to its pollution with the products of its own disintegration; and the connective tissue which sheathes and supports the vessels may likewise suffer from the same cause. Simple disturbances of the hepatic circulation, also, may of course lead to disorders of the nutrition of the liver. Lastly, morbid changes of some danger may arise from disorders primarily affecting the biliary channels and ducts. The mere stoppage of the outflow from the common bile-duct may affect the liver seriously, and inflammation of the bile-ducts them- selves are obviously still more dangerous (Art. 512). 20â€”2

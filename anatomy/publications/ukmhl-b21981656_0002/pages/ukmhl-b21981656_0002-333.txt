CHAPTER LVIII. ATROPHY AND DEGENERATION OF THE LIVER. 485. Simple atrophy. Starvation which has been rapidly fatal, and grave chronic disorders of nutrition of long standing, may equally induce extreme atrophy of the liver. The experiments of Bidder, Schmidt, and Voit have shown that in dogs and cats starvation may reduce the volume of the Uver by two-thirds. The diminution is chiefly due to the dwindling of the liver-cells. In emaciated or marasmic patients, whether the wasting is due to senile decay or to organic disease, the liver is usually greatly diminished in size, and in some cases occupies only one-third of its original volume. The atrophy is seldom uniform, the margins of the organ being usually the most wasted. The anterior margin of the right lobe and the whole margin of the left are often very markedly shrunken. In extreme cases the parts just mentioned, as well as other regions (notably along the line of the suspensory ligament), may be altogether devoid of liver-cells. The atrophy in these cases is primarily due to loss of the liver- ceUs, which become steadily smaller (Fig. 183 A) and at length vanish outright. The trabeculae and lobules dwindle, and the interlobular or portal sheaths of connective tissue (Fig. 182 d) ap- proach each other. When the lobules have entirely disappeared, the meshes enclosed by the portal sheaths enclose mere slareds of loose fibrous tissue (e) composed of little else than collapsed capillaries. The bile-ducts within the portal sheaths (/) persist however, and in some parts seem even increased in number; at any rate a section through the interlobular structures often shows that at certain points whole clusters and groups of bile-ducts have been cut across (/). The atrophic tissue is usually poor in cells; but if any obstruc- tion to the outflow of bile has taken place, signs of inflammation and cellular infiltration may be seen (Art. 496). The wasted borders of the lobes may be reduced to mere

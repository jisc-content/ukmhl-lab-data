CHAPTER XXIV. ATROPHY AND DEGENERATION OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. 330. The lymphatic glands stand to the lymphatic system somewhat in the same relation as the spleen to the blood-vessels. The glands may be described as masses of lymphadenoid tissue (that is to say, of reticular fibrous tissue containing lymphoid cells in its meshes) aggregated here and there around the lymph- channels. They contribute to the lymph the lymphoid elements produced in their follicular mesh-work, and perhaps exert upon it some chemical influence besides. The lymph passing through the glands is derived from a three- fold source. The chief source is the transudation from the blood. This permeates the tissues, giving up to them some of its con- stituents and taking up from them some products of their meta- bolism : while at many points of the body, and especially at the absorbing mucous surfaces, substances enter and mingle with the lymph which are originally derived from without the body. From the normal sources of the lymph the lymphatic glands may in like manner receive noxious matters; and these may be such as to induce more or less grave disorders of function, and even of anatomical structure. Thus the lymphatic glands are liable to secondary disease, following upon primary disease of the tissues whence their lymph is derived. In addition to these the lymphatic glands are subject to various forms of independent disease, which are partly retrogressive and partly progressive or constructive in their nature. 331, Simple atrophy. In advanced age the lymphatic tissues generally are observed to undergo senile diminution ; the lymphatic glands become smaller, and the lymphadenoid tissue of the mucous membranes becomes scantier. The thymus gland, which is of the same nature, dwindles away in the early years of Hfe.

PKEFACE The very rapid sale of Professor Ziegler's text-book in Germany has led to an unforeseen delay in the completion of the Second Part. Two editions of the sections already published having been exhausted, the Professor has been obliged to give to the preparation of a third edition of these the time he hoped to spend in completing the re- maining sections. My own purpose was that the second volume of this English version should conclude the book, but in view of the requests which reach me from every side I have thought it better to bring out the first eight sections as an instalment than to put off the publication of the whole for another year. The third and concluding volume is already in hand, and will be of about the same size as the present. It will contain the sections on the Kidney, the Lungs, and the Nervous System, together with general indexes to the whole work. In the third German edition the arrangement of the articles has been recast, and other changes of form have been made; but in order to preserve the continuity of the English version I shall follow throughout the plan of the first volume. This plan has been generally approved, and it appears to be the most convenient for English students.

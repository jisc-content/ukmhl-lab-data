CHAP. XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. 155 stratum. Similar blisters are formed in putrefactive and gan- grenous afltections of the skin (Art. 42). Inflammatory vesiculation is always then the result of excava- tion due to destruction of epidermal cells in the softer layers of the epidermis, the excavations being always more or less fully occupied by exuded liquid. The epidermal cells may perish in various ways. The time and mode in which the cells die, and the consistence and amount of the exudation determine the character of the vesicular eruption. Thus if the cells are directly injured and killed out- right (as by high temperature), while the papillary vessels are simultaneously damaged and pour out abundant exudation, the dead cells are very rapidly dissolved and disappear. On the other hand, if the injury primarily affects the vessels of the cutis and papillae and so induces exudative inflammation, the cells perish slowly and pass through a comparatively prolonged stage of mere swelling. When a small portion of the skin is exposed for a short time to a high temperature, the first effect is a marked reddening of the surface. Then the horny layer is raised by the formation beneath it of a cavity distended with fluid, and a blister is produced. Fia, 145. Section through the maegin of a blistee due to a bubn.

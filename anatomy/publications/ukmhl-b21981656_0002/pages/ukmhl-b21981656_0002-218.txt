198 THE SKIN. [sect. V. Kaposi (IJebra's Diseases of the skin iv, Patli. ?t. Therap. d. HatUkrankheiten Vienna 1880). Adenoma of the sweat-glands is a somewhat rare affection. It gives rise to nodules, which break down and ulcerate (Verneuil, Arch, generales ISo^; Thiersch, Der Epithelialkrehs 1865). Secondary neoplasms of the skin are not very common, though they do occur in connexion with both connective-tissue and epithelial tumours. Malignant growths of the skin itself are espe- cially apt to infect healthy parts of it, and give rise to daughter- tumours. Of growths in other organs mammary cancer is the most apt to produce cutaneous metastases.

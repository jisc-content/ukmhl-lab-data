104 THE SPLEEN AND THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS, [SECT. IIL The decrease in the volume of the lymphatic tissues is due to a diminution in the number of their lymphoid elements. In the case of the thymus these elements disappear wholly, and the remaining connective tissue becomes transformed into fat. This general physiological retrogression may be imitated under morbid conditions, especially in the general marasmus of chil- dren ; but wasting of the lymphatic tissues may also follow upon localised disease. The mesenteric glands are those most apt to atrophy. In such cases the lymphoid elements, and chiefly those of the medullary cylinders, are the first to disappear. Sometimes the lymphoid elements entirely disappear and the reticulum is changed into adipose tissue, beginning at the hilum. Atrophied lymphatic glands, if not morbidly pigmented, have a light grey tint and are usually firmer than is normal: when transformed into fatty tissue, the change is sufficiently apparent. 332. Amyloid degeneration of the lymphatic glands is a common aff"ection. Usually other organs are affected by it at the same time; it is rarely confined to the glands alone. When it is, the cause is nearly always some chronic suppuration within the territory whence the lymph-supply of the affected glands is drawn. If the amyloid change is at all advanced it is often distinguishable by the dull greyish tint and firm consistence of the glands on section; to make certain however, we must employ the iodine or methyl-violet reaction, or examine the glands microscopically.

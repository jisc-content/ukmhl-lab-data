CHAPTER XXVII. FOREIGN SUBSTANCES IN THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. 334. Minutely divided foreign substances which have gained access to the lymphatic vessels are intercepted and retained for a longer or shorter time in the glands. Thus after haemorrhage into the tissues the red corpuscles or their remains are conveyed to the glands^ and deposited there within the carrier- cells. At first these carrier-cells with the corpuscles or pigment (hydrated ferrous oxide, Art. 268) they contain are met with mainly in the sinuses (Fig. 135); but afterwards they enter the follicles. Occasionally the deposit may be so large that the proper structure of the gland is obscured by it. The appearance of the gland is altered greatly, and it may be stained dark brownish-red or russet, so as occasionally to recall the look of the spleen-pulp, especially when the colouring-matter of the blood in solution passes into its substance as well as the insoluble pigment.

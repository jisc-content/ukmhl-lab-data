CHAPTER XV. SCLEROSIS AND ATHEROMA. 297. Sclerosis in an artery implies the existence of local thickenings of its inner coat. They appear as slight broadened prominences, rising above the level of the normal intima as definite flat or convex plaques or patches. The margins may be steep or sloping, the surface is smooth. The patches may be translucent or almost gelatinous, or cartilaginous, or white and densely fibrous. These patches appear in arteries of all sizes—from the aorta just above its valves to the smallest arteriole. They are often few in number; but in other cases they are extraordinarily numerous, cases occurring in which the intima of the aorta is so beset that there scarcely remains a healthy spot on its surface. If the sclerosis is at all marked there are always found, in addition to the greyish or cartilaginous patches, other plaques of an opaque white or yellowish-white colour. These may be smooth or rough; and not infrequently the tissue has disintegrated and fallen away from them, leaving so-called ulcers with white detritus lying on their floors; or the rough and ulcerated spots may be covered with thrombi. The white or yellowish plaques are known as atheromatous patches, and the eroded spots as atheromatous ulcers, the process as a whole being described as atheroma of the arteries. It is thus a sequel of sclerosis. Very often a third change is associated with these, namely the calcification of the affected s]Dots. When this occurs the white atheromatous patches become hard and rigid to the feel, giving one the impression of a plate of bone lying beneath the superficial layer. In the veins these changes are much less common, and in general much less marked; but they do sometimes occur. Calcifi- cation is oftener met with than simple atheroma.

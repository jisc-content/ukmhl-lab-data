THE LIVER AND PANCREAS, [sect. VIII. 320 Iodine gives the characteristic brown colour, and methyl-aniline a pale ruby tint (Art. 58). The unaltered tissue varies in appearance in different cases. When the liver-cells contain no fat, they are usually of a bro^vn or reddish-brown colour. The presence of fat makes them look yellowish-white. Well-marked amyloid change is always associated with enlarge- ment of the liver. The edges are thickened and rounded and the surface is smooth, but the serous covering is free from thickening. The tissue becomes firmer and much more elastic. The amount of blood contained in it varies but is generally small, at least in the more degenerate portions. General amyloid disease of the liver occurs chiefly in connexion with cachectic conditions, such as those depending on tuberculosis, chronic suppuration, syphilis, etc. Other organs are simultaneously affected ir; a similar manner, especially the spleen, intestine, and kidneys. The liver may at the same time be diseased in other ways; thus in tuberculosis it may contain tubercles, and in syphilis it may exhibit the characteristic hyperplasia of the periportal con- nective tissue (Art. 499) or gummatous foci in various stages. Circumscribed amyloid change of the liver, limited to one or more spots, is much less common than the uniformly diffused or general affection; but it is occasionally met with. Cases are recorded in which the amyloid substance was aggregated into nodes or nodules, or confined to a few isolated blood-vessels. The latter is especially the case in the vessels of cicatricial tissue developed in consequence of syphilitic inflammation. Eeferences :â€”Arts. 58, 59; Wilks, Guy''s Hosp.

THE SKIN. 184 [sect. V. the papillae so as to lead to their atrophy, we have what is called a corn (clavus). The constant irritation of the papUlary layer thus caused, especially when associated with external friction or pressure, induces more or less intense inflammation, and this occasionally passes into suppuration. Sometimes the hypertrophy takes the form not of flattened or discoid thickening but of a horn-like protuberance {cornu cutaneum), which may reach a considerable size. The base usually includes a few enlarged and vascular papillae. Inflammatory' warts are essentially of the same nature as the hypertrophies just described, though their appearance is very different. They are the result of long-continued irritation of a special kind. One of the commonest forms is that known as the venereal wart or cauliflower excrescence {condyloma acuminatuvi). This is usually seated on some part of the external genitals or around the anus; the special irritation which induces it is that Pig. 155.

The fibrous tissue on which they stand often becomes tumid at the same time, while the epidermal layers become thickened and hypertrophied, and so may cover over some of the irregularities caused by the branching of the papillae. But many of these remain and are markedly exaggerated, so that the entire growth takes on a typically papillomatous appearance. These warts are often very numerous and crowded together at one spot. Though small and inconspicuous at first they may grow

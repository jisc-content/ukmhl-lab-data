CHAPTER XX. DISORDEKS OF CIRCULATION AND INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SPLEEN. 319. The amount of blood contained in the spleen is subject to considerable and incessant physiological variation. During digestion the organ increases in size from congestive hyperaemia, which passes away as the blood-supply diminishes on the con- traction of the afferent arteries; the reduction in size being further aided by the tension of the elastic fibres and the contrac- tion of the unstriped muscular fibres of the trabeculae and the capsule. Congestive hyperaemia may in like manner occur as a morbid condition, exceeding the physiological condition in intensity and duration. In all the infective disorders of the system, as in typhoid and other acute exanthemata, in syphilis, and in pyaemia the onset of the disease is accompanied by splenic hyperaemia. The spleen enlarges, and that in much greater proportion to its size than do the other organs which become hyperaemic at the same time: this is due to the fact that not merely are the capillaries and veins distended with blood, but also the mass of the splenic pulp which is in free communication with them. Such a spleen looks large and its capsule is tense; the pulp is deep red, and so soft that on section it may be easily scraped away. The malpighian follicles sometimes stand out distinctly as white nodules, sometimes are scarcely recognisable amid the swollen pulp. 320. The congestive hyperaemia may pass away rapidly, but it often persists for some time and further changes are set up in consequence. This is especially the case with the enlargement accompanying the acute infective diseases, such as typhoid, pyaemia, relapsing fever, ague, acute nephritis, and scarlatina.

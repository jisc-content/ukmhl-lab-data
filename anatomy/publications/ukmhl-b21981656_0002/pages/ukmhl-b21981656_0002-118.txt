When the pulp becomes amyloid the walls of the capillaries and venules become thickened and degenerate. See ViRCHOW (Virck.

Traumatic rupture is more common, and may occur in a healthy spleen or in one which has already undergone morbid change. Ruptures of any con- siderable size are followed by very grave haemorrhage. If the haemorrhage is stayed by the formation of a thrombus filling the rent, the wound may heal as in other organs; the clot is gradually absorbed and a scar takes its place. The same process takes place in other wounds of the spleen. Death sometimes ensues not from primary haemorrhage but from suppurative inflammation set up in the wounded tissue.

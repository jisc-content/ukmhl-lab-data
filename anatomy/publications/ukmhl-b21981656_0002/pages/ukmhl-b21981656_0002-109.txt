CHAPTER XIX. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OP THE SPLEEN. 317. Structure of the spleen. The spleen plays a peculiar and important part in connexion with the elaboration and meta- bolism of the blood; and its relation to the blood accounts in some measure for its anatomical structure and for its special relation to the vascular mechanism. The proper or characteristic tissue of the spleen is the pulp, and this is so intimately connected with the vascular system that its interspaces constantly contain both the fluid and the corpuscular elements of the blood in abundance. The volume of the adult spleen is from 150 to 180 ccm. The spleen-pulp consists of a delicate membranous reticulum or ' honeycomb' traversed by stouter strands or trabeculae origin- ating in the capsule or in the fibro-cellular (lymphadenoid) sheaths that ramify with the vessels from the hilum. The interspaces of the reticulum are in communication with wide thin-walled capillaries and veins deriving their blood-supply from the arteries, which enter at the hilum and bifurcate dichotomously into minute arterioles. The capillaries of course intervene between the arterioles and the radicles of the veins. It has been shown that the capillary-walls are not continuous but interrupted, so that blood can permeate freely the meshes of the pulp. And even if, as some maintain, there are no easily-visible clefts or pores in the vessels, it is at least certain that the walls are in so far more pervious than the walls of other vessels that the corpuscles pass through them with great ease, and that the mass of the pulp is in part made up of blood-cells. The reticulum contains lymphoid cells, larger round colourless cells with one or more nuclei, and ordinary red corpusctes, together with corpuscle-carrying cells, pig- ment-granule cells, and' free yellow or brownish pigment. This pigment in conjunction with the blood gives the spleen its brownish-red colour.

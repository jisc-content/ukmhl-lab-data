CHAPTER X. ENDOCARDITIS AND MYOCARDITIS. 280. Acute endocarditis is an inflammatory process set up by the presence in the blood of some irritant substance. It most commonly attacks the valves, but it may occur at any point of the endocardial lining. It usually takes the form of ' vegetative' or ' warty' endocarditis, which is characterised by the formation of small knotty and warty growths or vegetations, translucent or greyish or yellowish in tint, and projecting from the surface of the membrane. These are often overlaid and concealed by white or reddish or mottled thrombi. The valvular vegetations generally form in rows along the lines of contact of the valves in closure; but they may be spread over the surface of the valves, or aggregated in groups to form large nodular or cauliflower-like excrescences. When they affect other parts, such as the wall of the auricle, the ventricular septum, the apex, etc., they are in general disposed irregularly, and may be aggregated into nodular masses, or scattered in isolated patches. If the separate vegetations are all small but numerous and closely set, they may give the surface a granular or shaggy or merely turbid appearance; and close examination may be required to make out their individual existence. In the mildest forms no prominences above the surface are formed, so that the triae nature of the patches is only to be made out with the microscope. 281. The vegetations consist essentially of subendocardial exudations and infiltrations. The surface layers of the fully-developed vegetation (Fig. 123 c) are made up of granular (e) and fibrinous masses, which are for the most part merely coagulated exudations. Now and then patches appear which are distinguished by their fine and uniform granu- lation {()), and by their avidity for anilin-stains ; they are possibly colonies of micrococci. 4â€”2

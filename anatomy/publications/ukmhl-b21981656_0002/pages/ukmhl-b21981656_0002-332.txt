[sect. VTII. THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. 312 has seldom any grave consequences, inasmuch as the branches anastomose freely and collateral circulation is readily set up. Only in somewhat rare instances, where the blood-pressure within the liver or generally through the body is low, are the propelling forces behind the point of obstruction insufficient to maintain the flow. In such a case the affected region may become engorged by reflux from the veins, and the blood escaping from the ill-nourished capillaries may give rise to haemorrhagic infiltration. Such an infiltration is however seldom so intense as to obscure altogether the outlines of the lobules. When the supply of arterial blood is entirely cut off, the liver-cells perish by necrosis (Cohnheim and LiTTEN, Virch. Arch. vol. 77). Haemorrhage may likewise take place in consequence of changes in the vessel-walls (as in haemor- rhagic purpura, and in phosphorus-poisoning), or of obstruction {e.g. by thrombosis) of the hepatic veins.

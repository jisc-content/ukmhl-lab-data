CHAPTER LVI. MALFORMATIONS AND MALPOSITIONS OF THE LIVER. 482. Malformations of the liver are not common, and have little clinical importance. Absence of the organ is very rare, at least in foetuses not otherwise gravely malformed. Abnormalities in the number of the lobes, either by excess or defect, are commoner. In a few cases accessory livers have been noted, in the form of small nodules seated in the suspensory ligament. Absence of the gall-bladder has been several times observed, as also cases of abnormal narrowness or width of the bile-ducts, and abnormalities in the opening of the common duct into the in- testine. Of congenital malpositions the most notable are the mis- placement of the liver on the left side instead of the right in Situs transversus viscerum (Art. 11), and protrusion of the organ into the thorax when the diaphragm is defective, or to the exterior when the abdominal wall is cleft. Acquired deformities are very frequently the result of textural changes in the parenchyma of the organ (see under hepatitis Art. 497, syphilis Art. 499, cancer Art, 503), or of changes in the surrounding parts. Thus tight-lacing, by which the lower part of the thorax is violently compressed, gives rise to a characteristic deformity of the liver. The surface in contact with the lower ribs is indented and its fibrous capsule is white and thickened, while the liver-tissue beneath is atrophied or gone altogether (Art. 485). When the indentation is deep the right lobe is completely divided into a larger upper lobe and a smaller lower one; and in extreme cases the lower lobe becomes freely moveable on the upper, and sometimes turns upwards as on a hinge. The outer surface of the right lobe is frequently marked Avith shallow grooves corresponding to the ribs. The upper surface also often shows anterio-posterior grooves or furrows. According to LiEBERMEiSTER these are due to wrinkles or folds into which the liver is thrown when expiration is somehow obstructed and the

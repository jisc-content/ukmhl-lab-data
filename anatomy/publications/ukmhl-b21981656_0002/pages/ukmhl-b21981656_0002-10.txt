VI PREFACE. My renewed acknowledgements are due, and are very heartily rendered, to Professor Klein and Professor Greenfield, who have read and commented on each sheet as it passed through the press. Dr George Thin has in like manner done me the kindness of reading the chapters on the Skin. Professor Ziegler has given me his ready help on many points, and has enabled me to utilise his additions to the text of the later sections. Dr Sims Woodhead courteously placed at my disposal the drawing of Actinomyces from which Fig. 174 5 was engraved. In view of the generous aid I have thus received I am encouraged to hope that little in recent Pathology has been overlooked which is likely to be of value to English students. DONALD MACALISTER St John's College, Cambridge, February 1884.

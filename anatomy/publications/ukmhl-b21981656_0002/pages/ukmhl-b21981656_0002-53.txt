CHAPTER VI. CHANGES IN THE LYMPH. 269. The lymph is merely the liquid transuded from the blood-vessels, together with certain products of tissue-metabolism and certain matters taken up [e.g. by the lacteals) from the outside. To this the lymphatic glands contribute a number of lymphoid elements, in addition to the few cells derived from the blood. The sources of the lymph being thus somewhat various, we may expect that morbid changes in its composition will â€¢ not be uncommon. Changes in the blood and disorders of the tissues generally give rise to changes in the lymph; and the various impurities of the blood already described are all of them apt to pass into the lym- phatic system on leaving the blood-vessels. To discuss in detail the changes which may take place in the lymph would in fact require us to repeat what we have said concerning the impurities of the blood, as well as to go through all the morbid processes affecting the tissues in which the lymph-stream takes its rise. Many of the changes referred to are not capable of microscopical demonstration, being due to substances dissolved in the lymph. As regards the formed elements, the morbid changes are either such as relate to the quantity or quality of the lymph-cells, or to the addition of solid products of tissue-waste or of foreign matters derived from without. As an example of such changes in the normal contents of the lymph, we may refer to Fig. 120, represent- ing a perivascular lymph-sheath (c) from a lunatic's brain, which contained both sclerosed and softened patches. The lymph-sheath is dilated and contains numerous cells, which are laden with colour- less products of degeneration of brain-tissue {h^ or with the debris of disintegrated blood (/ig). There are also lymphoid cells (h) not enclosing any such matters. The two former kinds of cells are foreign to the normal lymph of the brain, and even of the latter the numbers are here abnormally great. s. P. A. 3

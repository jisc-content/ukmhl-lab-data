CHAPTER LV. PIGMENTARY INFILTRATION OF THE LIVER. 480. The liver is the largest gland in the body, and the due performance of its functions is of essential importance to health. Its large size brings it into anatomical relation with many and various organs, and as it is only in part shielded by the wall of the thorax it is exposed to direct injuries from without which modify its form and position, and it may be its structure and function also. Its peculiar relations to the vascular system expose it to injury from the side of the circulation, and that in a twofold manner. Noxious matters, in the first place, may be brought to it, as to other organs, by the blood of the general or systemic circu- lation ; and, in the second, by the venous blood collected by the portal vessels from the alimentary canal and spleen. The capillary system of the liver is remarka,bly elaborate and capacious. Moreover, the portal blood circulates under very low pressure. The circulation within the liver is therefore very slow. One consequence is—that foreign substances suspended in the blood are very apt to be deposited in the liver (Art. 266—268), and this is true of the arterial blood (brought by the hepatic artery) as well as of the portal blood. Pigmentation or pigmen- tary infiltration of the liver-substance is the not uncommon result. When the blood contains any considerable quantity of dis- integrated red corpuscles, or of the coloured iron-compounds re- ferred to in Art. 266, and these are in part deposited in the liver, they at first lodge in the capillaries of the interlobular con- nective tissue (Fig. 180 d) or in the peripheral or portal zone of the lobules (e). Presently they escape from the vessels and appear in the interlobular connective tissue, and to some extent in the interior of the liver-cells (Art. 481). When the quantity of pig- ment in circulation is great the pigmentation may be so dense that the structure of the tissue is completely masked by it [d);

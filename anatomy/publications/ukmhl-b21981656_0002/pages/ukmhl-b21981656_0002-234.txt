Lymphoid elements also escape from the reticular substructures, and passing between the epithelial cells reach the surface and form the swollen spherules known as mucus-corpuscles. According to Stohr they are most abundant where the mucosa contains lymphadenoid tissue. The mucus secreted by the membrane is of great service to it both in normal and in morbid conditions. It forms a protective covering, and is often of use in warding off the effects of noxious substances or influences which may tend to affect the membrane injuriously.

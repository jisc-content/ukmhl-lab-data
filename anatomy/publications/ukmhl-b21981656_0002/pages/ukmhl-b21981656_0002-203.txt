CHAPTER XXXIX. INFLAMMATORY HYPERTROPHIES OP THE SKIN. 393. The inflammatory processes discussed in the last few Articles have this in commonâ€”that the formation of new tissue is inconsiderable, and in general little more than is necessary to make good the tissue which is lost. Even the granulomatous affec- tions usually end in disintegration and ulceration, in the course of which the new granulation-tissue perishes. But we pointed out one or two exceptions to this rule, as for instance under eczema (Arts. 385, 392) and necrogenic pustule (Art. 390), in which chronic inflammation resulted in hyperplasia of the skin. The hyperplasia may extend to the epidermal structures as well as to the fibrous elements. The excessive production of epidermal cells may be manifested simply by increased desquama- tion, or by thickening of one or more of the epidermal strata. Hyperplasia of the fibrous strata always involves an increase of their thickness over a more or less extensive area. When the papillae are the structures most affected, they increase chiefly in length and often become subdivided as they grow, giving rise to unevennesses of the surface, which may be slight and wide-spread or aggregated into tumour-like masses. The new tissue, while still recent, contains abundance of cells, and is in fact not far removed from granulation-tissue: in more advanced stages it contains fewer cells and is densely fibrous and scar-like. Both types may coexist in the same case. 394. When a part is continually exposed to slight mechanical irritation inducing often-repeated hyperaemia or slight inflamma- tion, the epidermis may at length become hypertrophied. If the homy layer is chiefly involved, and callous or horny growths result, they are described as callosities (tylomata). They are commonest on the hands and feet. When the callous thickening extends inwards and presses on

CHAPTEK L. THE THROAT. 4i4i2. The mucous membrane of the throat (including in the term the soft palate, tonsils, and pharynx) resembles that of the mouth in structure; it contains however a larger amount of l3rmphadenoid tissue, which at various points is aggregated into nodules or follicles. In the tonsils especially this tissue is very abundant. According to Stohr {Biolog. Centralblatt 1882) lym- phoid cells are continually migrating from the lymphadenoid tissue to the free surface. The disorders of the back of the mouth and pharynx correspond with those of the mouth generally, and many of them are indeed but partial manifestations or results of the latter. Certain forms of inflammation and certain new growths are however confined to the soft palate, tonsils, and pharynx, or at least produce in them their most characteristic symptoms. Inflammation of the throat (referred to generally as angina or pharyngitis) may be due to local irritation, or to some general affection like measles, scarlatina, or small-pox. The catarrhal varieties give rise to redness and swelling, which may be diffused or disposed in irregular streaks and patches. The mucous mem- brane at the same time pours out a slimy or purulent secretion, which often forms a film or coating on the surface. In some of the inflammatory affections (such as that which accompanies small pox or herpes labialis) vesicles are formed; these speedily rupture, and leave small erosions of the surface (angina vesiculosa). Often too, especially in children, the inflamed membrane is beset or overlaid with white patches of thrush (Art. 486). The lympha- denoid follicles are sometimes the parts chiefly affected. The solitary follicles of the pharynx and the serous glands at the back of the tongue swell up and project above the surface, and the tonsils are likewise enlarged {angina tonsillaris). If the swollen follicles break down small erosions or ulcers may be

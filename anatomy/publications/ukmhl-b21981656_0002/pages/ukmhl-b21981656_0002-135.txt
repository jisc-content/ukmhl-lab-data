More rarely the caseation precedes the formation of the large cells; or the process may end with the stage of homogeneous change (Art. 333). The region outside the tubercle is often infiltrated with small cells, the infiltration extending as far as the sinuses, the capsule, or the fibrous tissues of the hilum. The reticulum is either unaltered or slightly thickened, its cells seeming to be somewhat swollen. Or a large-celled hyperplasia of the lymphadenoid tissue (Fig. 139 d) takes place in patches outside the tubercles, in some cases leading to the formation of coarse fibrous tissue. The latter occurs chiefly in chronic tuberculous disease. The glands most commonly affected with tuberculosis are those of the mesentery, the root of the lung, and the neck; the other glands become tuberculous much less frequently. The actual frequency of tuberculosis of the lymphatic glands is not easily determined by mere anatomical investigation, for it is often very difficult to decide whether a given glandular afi'ection is tuberculous or not. The large-celled hyperplasias (Art. 340) have in the above account been separated 8â€”2

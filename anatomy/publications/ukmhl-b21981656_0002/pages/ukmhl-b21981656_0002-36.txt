16 [sect. I. BLOOD AND LYMPH. circulation of occlusion by embolism has already been described (Art. 30). An embolus may undergo changes analogous to those which take place in the primary thrombus; it may soften, or shrink, or become calcified, or be replaced by fibrous tissue. The process of organisation is the same as that already described, but the volume of the fibrous plug is always very much smaller than that of the original embolus. After some weeks or months the site of the embolus is often marked by nothing more than a fibrous band or a nodular protuberance on the inner coat of the vessel. In other instances the lumen is crossed by numerous threads running singly or connected into a loose network. But the process is necessarily very different when the embolus sets up destructive inflammation around it. The inflammation then takes the suppurative form; the vessel-wall, the sheath, and the surrovmding tissue are successively attacked, and an embolic abscess is formed (Art. 291),

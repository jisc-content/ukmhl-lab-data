THE VASCULAR MECHANISM. [sect. II, 82 an aneurysmal sac at all. This condition has been described as aneurysmal varix. The pressure of the arterial blood gradually dilates the vein, giving it a varicose appearance, and if the condition persist its wall may become notably thickened. The non-traumatic forms of varicose aneurysm specially affect the great vessels of the thorax ; the traumatic form generally occurs between the median basilic vein and the brachial artery, at the spot where bleeding from the arm is practised. 312. The vascular neoplasms, or tumours in whose structure the blood-vessels play an essential part, have already been discussed in the General Pathological Anatomy. Of this class the angiomata (Arts. 149, 150), the angiosarcomata (Art. 161), and the cylindro- mata (Art. 163) are the chief species. Tumours of all kinds may of course involve the walls of the blood-vessels in their growth. The adventitia is specially liable to be implicated in carcinomatous or sarcomatous proliferation. The media and intima resist the invasion longer, especially in the case of the arteries : the veins are less resistent. The walls of the veins are often broken into by cancerous growths, so that tumour- particles gain entrance to the blood-current; and in this way cancerous thrombosis is set up. If tumour-germs are swej)t off from the thrombi, they may give rise to metastatic growths at some other point of the vascular system where they lodge.

CHAP. LVI.] MALFOKMATIONS AND MALPOSITIONS OF LIVER. 309 lower ribs dragged inwards by the abdominal muscles. Zahn (Rev. mM. de la Suisse romande 1881) refers them to the pressure exerted by the hypertrophied muscular bundles of the diaphragm in cases of obstructed inspiration, and speaks of them therefore as diaphragmatic grooves. Orth (Pathol. Diagnostik i) has seen them well marked in a seven months' foetus, and thinks they are at least in some cases congenital. Exemption from pressure over a circumscribed area may also tend to deform the liver. This occurs for example when the diaphragm is ruptured. If the patient survives and the opening remains patent, a conical plug of liver-substance gradually pro- triides into the thorax. Displacements of the liver are very common. It turns readily on its transverse axis, so that the level of the anterior edge varies greatly with the fulness of the abdominal cavity. Actual dislocations are much rarer than such rotations; but sometimes the liver sinks abnormally owing among other things to the elongation of the suspensory ligament. This condition (hepar mobile or floating liver) is most marked in cases of extreme dilatation of the stomach, where the abdominal wall is at the same time much relaxed. The liver is of course forced down if the diaphragm is depressed, as in pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Wounds and ruptures of the liver from mechanical injury are highly dangerous, and often lead to fatal haemorrhage. Small wounds may heal in the same manner as wounds of other tissues, by the formation of granulations and a cicatrix.

THE ALIMENTAEY TRACT. [sect. VII. 256 When a salivary duct is obstructed or occluded the smaller ducts behind the obstruction become dilated by the retained secretion. These dilated ducts are either cylindrical or sausage-shaped, or fusiform, or even pear-shaped. As the accumulation goes on the ducts and the lumen of the gland become distended into globular cysts, often of very considerable size. The cysts produced by dilatation of the submaxillary and sub- lingual ducts protrude from beneath the tongue, and are often spoken of as ranulae^ like those which arise from dilatation of the mucous glands of the tip of the tongue (Art. 439). Salivary calculi are stony concretions which form occasion- ally in Stenson's and Wharton's ducts. They consist of calcium phosphate and carbonate. Sometimes they enclose foreign matters which have accidentally gained access to the ducts. According to Klebs they also contain fungi, and these he regards as the active factors in bringing about the precipitation of the calcium salts. Tumours both of the connective-tissue and the epithelial types are met with in the salivary glands. Of the former class fibroma, sarcoma, enchondroma, and myxoma, may be mentioned. They usually give rise to definite nodes or nodules, and sometimes include cystic cavities (cystic sarcoma). Carcinoma usually begins as an isolated nodule, which extends so as to involve the whole gland, and then invades the surrounding tissues. Ulceration and gangrene now and then supervene. These neoplasms are very apt to exhibit a mixed type of structure, especially those of the parotid gland. Thus cartilaginous, mucoid, sarcomatous, and fibroid ele- ments may all occur within the same tumour. Sometimes the peculiar hyaline formations characteristic of cylindroma (Art. 163) are met with. Combinations of carcinoma with sarcoma or en- chondroma are not uncommon.

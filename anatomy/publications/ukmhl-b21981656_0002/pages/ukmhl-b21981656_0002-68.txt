CHAPTER IX. HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION OF THE HEART. 278. Enlargement of the heart, when not due to the presence of a tumour, is caused either by the dilatation of its cavities, or by the hyperplasia of its walls, generally of their muscular tissue but occasionally of their adipose tissue. Both dilatation and hyper- trophy may exist at the same time. In simple dilatation the auricular and ventricular cavities are enlarged, while the muscular walls are thinned by distension. The dilatation is often unilateral, that is to say confined to the right or to the left heart. Hyperplasia of the cardiac tissues is generally due to true hypertrophy of the muscular elements, the walls becoming abnormally thick. It may be confined to the walls alone, or may extend to the trabeculae and papillary mviscles; indeed the latter may show the change more strikingly than the other parts. If no secondary degeneration has intervened the hypertrophied muscle appears firm and brownish-red in colour. The general texture is not altered, but the muscle-elements are larger and more numerous than is normal. Higher degrees of hypertrophy are palpable even without section, the resistance and firmness of the walls being greatly increased. The size of the cavities in hypertrophy varies much. If dilata- tion coexist with hypertrophy, so that the cavities are larger than normal, we speak of it as excentric hypertrophy; if they are smaller it is concentric hypertrophy; if they are of normal size, it is simple hypertrophy. Very frequently the hypertrophy is not general, but confined to one side only. Hypertrophy with dilatation of the right heart involves increase chiefly in the transverse dimensions; hypertrophy with dilatation of the left heart increases rather the longitudinal or apex-to-base measurement. According to Beneke {Die anat. Grundlagen der Constitutions-anomcdieen Marbiirg 1878) the normal volume of the adult male heai-t is 260â€”310 com.

In many cutaneous affections the changes in the epidermal or epithelial cells do not cease with the simple swelling just described, but go on to the destruction and disintegration of a certain number of the cells, and in this way vesicles and blebs or blisters are produced. The terms vesicle and blister, used in connexion with cutaneous inflammations, imply an excavation under the epidermis due to destruction and solution of some of the cells. Blisters are never produced by the mere collection of fluid between the epidermal layers, say between the horny and the mucous layers. But blisters may be formed by transudation under the epidermis by which the whole membi'ane is raised without change over a definite area. Such blisters or blebs are not inflam- matory in their origin; they are due to vascular engorgement, and are met with in cases of extreme oedema of the integument. The transuded liquid simply raises the epidermal from the fibrous

165 CHAP. XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. A section through such a patch shows that the elevation of the skin is due to an infiltration extending (Art. 369) to the epidermis Fig. 151. Section through a syphilitic mucous patch. (Aniline-brown staining: x 100) a horny layer of the epidermis b rete Malpighii c corium . d homy layer swollen up and infil- trated with leucocytes e swollen cells of the rete Malpighii / swollen epidermis infiltrated with cells g degenerate epidermal cells, into which leucocytes have penetrated h granular coagula i swollen papilla infiltrated with cells k corium infiltrated with cells and fibrin I lymphatic vessel vt sweat-gland (Fig. 151 fg h), as well as into the papillary layer (i) and corium (k). The exudation consists of leucocytes and fibrin (h k), and its presence causes the papillae to be greatly enlarged and the epider- mal layers to be greatly thickened. The latter effect is increased by an increase in the productive activity of the epidermal cells. The patch may disappear by the absorption of the cellular and liquid exudations, and the incrustation and shedding of the diseased epidermis. The swelling first goes down in the middle of the patch, while the margins still remain infiltrated. The affected tissue disintegrates and suppurates, giving rise to an ulcer with infiltrated margins; and as this dries up a crust is formed which

As the fibrous tissue is gradually elaborated the fibrin disappears. Fig. 141. Adhesive peeicaeditis.

If the amount of it is small, it may simply give rise to a slight thickening of the serous membrane taking the form of a more or less sharply defined lustrous white spot, spoken of as a callosity or milk-spot. If the new tissue is more abundant, it may take the form of thick almost cartilaginous plaques or patches, or of diffused tendinous or scar-like thickenings. 353. Plastic pericarditis. Plastic inflammation of the pericarditim is usually an independent affection, but it may be associated with endocarditis and myocarditis, or be the result of pleuritic or mediastinal inflammation. Slight and localised pericarditis very often gives rise to the formation of the milk-spots just referred to; they may occur in considerable numbers and vary from a few millimetres to some centimetres in diameter. Sometimes the greater part or the whole of the pericardium may be covered with similar white thickenings. The heart itself may be either free, or involved in adhesions; and these latter may consist of a few thread-like bands stretching from the visceral to the parietal layers, or they may extend over the entire surface, binding the heart everywhere to the parietal layer (concretio pericardii). Sometimes the adhesions are brittle 9â€”2

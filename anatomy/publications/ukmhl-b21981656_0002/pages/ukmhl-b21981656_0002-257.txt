CHAPTER XLVIII. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 432. The alimentary canal consists essentially of an epithe- lial tube, which is furnished on its outer surface with certain auxiliary structures chiefly of a muscular kind. The diseases of the alimentary canal are thus for the most part diseases of mucous membrane. Their pathology is mainly a special application of the general principles considered in the last Section. In particular the causation of most of these diseases comes under the description already set forth in general terms. They are due as a rule to the presence in the alimentary canal of substances which are either noxious in themselves, or have undergone some abnormal decompo- sition after ingestion. It is not to be forgotten, however, that irritant matters may be conveyed to the intestinal tissues by the blood or lymph, and that morbid changes may be thus induced. The cGiferent segments of the alimentary canal differ consider- ably in their structure as well as in their functions. To these differences correspond certain striking differences in the pathologi- cal phenomena they exhibit. The forms of disease to which they are subject, the course a given disease may run, and the textural changes it sets up, all differ in the different parts of the tract. In fact this single viscus furnishes us with numerous and striking illustrations of the principleâ€”that the special form assumed by a disease depends not merely on the nature of the originating cause, but also to a great extent on the structure of the affected organ, in other words on the anatomical predisposition of the tissues that are involved.

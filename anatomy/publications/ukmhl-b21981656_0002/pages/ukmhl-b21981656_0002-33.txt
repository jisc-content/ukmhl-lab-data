13 CHAP. II.] INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION OR THROMBOSIS. The accumulation of leucocytes may become so great as to give the thrombus the appearance of a mass of granulation-tissue. The duration of the process also varies greatly. By operating on one of the lower animals we can be sure of finding the thrombus completely vascularised in twelve days. In the case figured above, the first formative cells are developing three weeks after the ligature. The leucocytes are derived from the vasa vasorum and the vessels in the neighbourhood of the occluded vessel. They enter chiefly from the zone of ligature, at the points where the inner coat is torn through and where the injury to the vessel-wall is gi'eatest. The new vessels are likewise derived from the vasa vasorum, though blood-channels are also opened up from the side Fig. 119. Diagrammatio section of a lioatured vessel.

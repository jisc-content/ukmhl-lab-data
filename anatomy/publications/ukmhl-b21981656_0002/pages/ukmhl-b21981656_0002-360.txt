340 [sect. VIII. THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. may be seated in any part of the liver but occur most commonly in the right lobe. The nodes are often of great size and cause the atfected lobe to be much enlarged, the normal tissue being for the most part replaced by tumour-tissue. The nodes are usually glob- ular and consist of soft or hard, white or slightly reddened tissue; the amount of cancer-juice which can be scraped from the cut sur- face varies much, and is sometimes very small indeed. At some points the tumour-tissue is sharply marked off from the liver-tissue, the latter being manifestly compressed and distorted. At other points the tumour is continuous with the liver-tissue. The larger nodes are frequently softened or necrotic in the centre, or contain extravasated blood. The second form has been well described as diffuse cancerous infiltration (or degeneration) of the liver. The organ is more or less enlarged, sometimes greatly enlarged; the serous capsule is thickened and tuberculated, much as in atrophic cirrhosis. On section also there is a resemblance to the cirrhotic liver, inasmuch as the whole organ is traversed and beset with anastomosing fibrous bands enclosing prominent islands of pale or reddish or bile-stained tissue. On examination these islands are seen to be carcinomatous in structure, and so the affection is distinguished from ordinary cirrhosis. In the third form the cancerous growths are seated in the inter- lobular connective tissue. Wherever the portal vessels run they are seen to be accompanied by white tumid nodules, in close mutual contact or actually coalescent, and varying in size with the size of the vessels. The smallest nodules are about the size of a millet- FiG. 197.

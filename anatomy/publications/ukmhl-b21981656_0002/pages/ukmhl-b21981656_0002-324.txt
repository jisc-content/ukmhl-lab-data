As the deposit occurs chiefly if not exclusively about the portal or interlobular vessels the pigmented patches follow their distribution (Fig. 180), and stand out in marked contrast to the pale or unpigmented central parts of the lobules. If the blood contains, as in leukaemia, an excess of colourless corpuscles, these are in like manner deposited in large numbers in the liver and give rise to what is called leukaemic infiltration. The deposits are distributed in the way just described, and are sometimes enormous in amount. The liver as a whole becomes swollen, and on section the lobules appear separated from each other by a broad zone of greyish-white. Sometimes nodular aggre- gations of the same kind accompany the general diffuse infiltration ; and the connective tissue being thereby distended and loosened

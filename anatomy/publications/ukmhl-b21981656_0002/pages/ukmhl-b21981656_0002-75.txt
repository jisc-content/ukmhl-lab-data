CHAP. X.] ENDOCARDITIS AND MYOCARDITIS. 55 We have already alluded to the results of valvular disease of this kind. In general terms they are these: the difficulties in the way of emptying the heart at each systole, whether from stenosis or regurgitation, are such that the blood tends to collect in the ventricle; the vascular system behind the diseased valve is per- manently over-distended with blood, and so becomes dilated; and the heart hypertrophies to meet the increased resistance, beginning with the part which serves to drive blood through the diseased valve. 284. Myocarditis not uncommonly accompanies endocarditis, the inflammation extending by continuity from the endocardium to the subendocardial and intermuscular connective tissue. In other cases the process may begin in the muscular tissue itself. In either instance the inflammation is characterised histologically by the appearance of an infiltration of leucocytes in the tissue of the heart-wall. Two forms of myocarditis are distinguished, according as the disease results in induration or in abscess. Indurative myocar- ditis leads to hyperplasia of the intermuscular fibrous tissue, and -6 Fig, 126. Soleeosis resulting from myooabditis.

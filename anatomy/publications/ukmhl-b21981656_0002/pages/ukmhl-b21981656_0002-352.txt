THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. [sect. VIII. 332 the change is from the beginning somewhat limited, affecting the interlobular tissue only, and not the whole of that. In such a case the section of the liver shows at first nothing more than a number of bands or strands of fibrous tissue (Fig. 192 6) running through it; these are greyish-red or yellow or greenish, and enclose isolated patches of liver-tissue that look yellow or grey or brownish as the case may be. Fig. 192. Atrophic cierhosib of the livek. a isolated patches of liver-tissue c cellular infiltration 6 bands of vascular fibrous tissue d peritoneum As the fibrous tissue shrinks and the liver-cells become atrophied, the liver at first more or less enlarged begins to contract. At the same time it becomes uneven and its surface is roughened, fi:om the unequal shrinking of the fibrous bands (&) and of the remaining patches of liver-tissue. When these latter are small the section appears granular; when they are larger it is rather to be described as nodular or tuberculated or 'hob-nailed.' When the fibrous over- growth (and thus the contraction) is confined to a part only of the portal territory, the inequalities are of larger size and the liver may thus become lobulated. In extreme cases the volume of the shrunken organ is reduced by a half or two-thirds, and its form is at the same time gravely altered so that it becomes rolled up into a cylinder or flattened and tongue-shaped. Interstitial hepatitis leading to contraction of the liver is de- scribed as atrophic or Laennec's cirrhosis (Fig. 191). Chronic interstitial hepatitis has been much investigated dui'iug the last twenty or thirty years, and attempts have been made to distinguish various forms. SuRRE for example describes eight of these. Such classifications

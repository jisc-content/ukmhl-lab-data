CHAPTER XXXVII. DISCOLORATION AND ATROPHY OF THE SKIN. 362. Discolorations of the skin may be diffuse or circum- scribed. They are due either to an increase of the natural pigment of the rete and corium (pigmentation proper), or to the deposit of abnormal pigment derived either from without or from some intrinsic source such as extravasated blood (dyschromatosis or staining). Certain abnormal pigmentations are congenital and take the form of brown or black spots of various size. They are called naevi pigmentosi or moles: naevus spilus is soft and smooth; naevus verrucosus is rough and warty; naevus pilosus is ha.iry (Art. 398). Acquired pigmentations are described generally as chloasmata and are either idiopathic or symptomatic. Freckles and sun-spots (lentigines and ephelides) are examples of the former; they are brownish or yellowish irregular specks from the size of a pin's head to that of a pea. Sun-spots occur chiefly on the face in young people and disappear with advancing years. True or ' cold' freckles have no favourite seat and persist during life (Art. 398). Pigmentation is often a result of frequently recurring hyper- aemia and inflammation, such for instance as are produced by excessive scratching (traumatic chloasma), or long-continued ex- posure to the sun (sun-burn). Disorders of the viscera, and especially of the uterine system in women (uterine chloasma), may be followed by discoloration of the skin; and the skin of marasmic patients is often remarkably pigmented. Addison's disease is an obscure affection in which the sldn assumes a brown or bronze-like hue (cutis aenea), and the patient falls into grave cachexia. The bronzing of the skin is said to be connected with the changes in the suprarenal bodies often observed in the disease; but it may be present when the suprarenals are healthy (see Burgee, Die Nebennieren Berlin 1883).

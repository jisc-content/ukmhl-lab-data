The sloughs themselves act as irritants and set up inflammation around them. Superficial epithelial sloughs become in this way infiltrated with pus and so are loosened and cast off. The loss of substance is then made good by regenerative multiplication of the remaining epithelial cells. Larger and deeper sloughs may in like manner be separated by suppurative inflammation taking place around

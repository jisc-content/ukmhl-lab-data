[sect. II. THE VASCULAR MECHANISM. 68 vessel shows white or greyish thickening of the intima and of the adventitia. The vessel, such as a cerebral artery, may thus be beset with circumscribed greyish translucent patches, or be trans- formed into a coarse white or greyish cord. This form is not to be distinguished, either with the eye or the microscope, from arterial thickening due to non-syphilitic fibrous hyperplasia. The second form of syphilitic arteritis occurs in the midst of foci of syphilitic disease affecting the tissues generally; the vessels are surrounded either with diffiise cellular infiltrations (the so-called gummatous granulations), or with dense cicatricial tissue (Arts. 128â€”130). In such cases the coats of the vessel are more or less altered and thickened (Fig. 130). FlO. 130.

While the process is still recent, not having yet passed the stage of granulation, the thickening of the intima is partly due to an abundant development of fibrocellular tissue (e). The cells are in part small and round, in part fusiform or stellate (/) corresponding to certain forms of fibroblasts. The adventitia is similarly altered. The media is usually but little beset with migratory ceils. In more advanced cases where fibroid change has succeeded active inflammation, the thickened coats of the vessels ai'e more

CHAPTER LI. THE SALIVARY GLANDS. 447. The salivary glands are racemose glands whose secretion is discharged into the oral cavity. The chief disorders to which they are liable are those due to inflammations, and to the growth of tumours. Mumps or epidemic parotitis is an infective inflammatory swelling of the parotid gland. The submaxillary and sublingual glands may be affected at the same time. The glands and the overlying tissues are much enlarged, and feel doughy to the touch. Similar swellings occur as secondary symptoms in connexion with certain infective disorders like typhoid, cholera, pyaemia, syphilis, diphtheria, etc. The swelling is due to inflammatory serous and cellular infil- tration of the interalveolar fibrous tissue of the glands. It issues either in resolution, or in fibroid induration, or in suppuration and abscess. Sometimes gangrene supervenes. Angina Ludovici is an acute phlegmonous inflammation of the tissue surrounding the submaxillary gland, resulting often in suppuration or gangrene. Milder forms of inflammation are also met with in connexion with disorder of the salivary glands, resulting from mechanical injury or retention of their secretion or from other causes not easy to determine. When chronic they lead to fibrous hyperplasia, while the gland-substance often becomes atrophied. If the duct becomes involved in a contracting cicatrix it may be obstructed or altogether occluded. 448. A salivary fistula is an opening or channel connecting a salivary duct with the surface of the mucous membrane or the skin. It results either from a wound, or from some suppurative inflammation leading to perforation.

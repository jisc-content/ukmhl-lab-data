CHAPTER VIII. ATROPHY AND DEGENERATION OF THE HEART. 273. Simple brown atrophy. In patients who have died of general marasmus the heart is often found to be greatly reduced in size. The investing fat is almost or altogether transformed into a gelatinous or mucoid substance, occasionally stained with yellow- ish pigment. The superficial cardiac vessels lying under the visceral pericardium are much convoluted from the shrinking of the subjacent structures; the cavities are small; and the muscular walls are thinned. They are also firmer than normal, and stained of a brownish tint. The endocardium is apparently thickened, but this is due to its enforced adaptation to a smaller surface than it originally covered. Indeed in simple cases the muscle-cells are the only elements which are altered (Fig. 121). The muscle- cells are abnormally small, and contain nume- rous fine yellow pigment-granules lying chiefly at the poles of the nuclei, but also scattered through the protoplasm of the cells. These retain their normal striation. If it were necessary we might distinguish some cases as exhibiting simple pig- mentary atrophy, and others brown pigmentary atrophy, according to the amount of pigment present. Brown atrophy is not infre- quently associated with fatty degeneration of the heart. Fig. 121. Brown atrophy of the mdscles of the heart. (Teased 'prepara- tion: x350) 274. Fatty degeneration and cloudy swelling. Fatty degeneration is one of the commonest affections of the substance of the heart, and not infrequently a cause of death. It is either uniformly diffused over the heart-muscle, or concentrated at certain spots. In the former case if the affection is at all advanced the muscular substance appears pale, yellow, limp, and easily torn; in the latter case it is speckled or mottled. The mottling is most beautifully seen in the papillary muscles and

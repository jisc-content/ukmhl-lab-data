CH. XXXTX.] INFLAMMATORY HYPERTROPHIES. 187 attack or by a condition of cutaneous atrophy. It affects the face, limbs, and trunk ; the patient often being literally ' hido-bound.' The skin feels as hard as a board, or like that of a frozen corpse (Kaposi). It is said that the fibrous tissues of the skin are hyperplastic and here and there infiltrated with small cells (Chiari, Viertelj.f. Derm. u. Syph. v ; for cases see Duhring, Diseases of the skin 1882). In one case of the disease Heller {Arch. f. klin. Med. x) found that the thoracic duct was obliterated. Sclerema neonatorum is a hardening of the subcutaneous connective tissue met with in infants, and chiefly afiecting the legs and feet. According to Langer (Wiener Sitzungsber. 1881), it is due to the solidification of the 'pcurvnie\dx(,s adiposus by cold when the infant becomes collapsed. The fat of children contains more palmitin and stearin and less oleiu than that of adults : it solidifies at 45" C. Adult fat at ordinary temperatures separates into two layers: the upper or liquid layer solidifies at 0" C, the lower or semi-solid layer liquefies at 36" C.

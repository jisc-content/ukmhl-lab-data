Amyloid change affects chiefly the lobular systems of blood-vessels. At first the capillaries of the lobules exhibit at various spots a kind of hyaline thickening or deposit in the endothelium; but as the change progresses they become completely enveloped by continuous hyaline masses (Fig. 185). The liver-cells are usually passive throughout the process, or at least they rarely become amyloid themselves. In the early stages they are quite unaltered, but as the amyloid deposits around them increase in bulk they become compressed and generally atrophied. In advanced stages they here and there perish out- right, or it may be that to some extent amyloid deposits take place in them. Where they persist they nearly always contain large or small globules of fat. Amyloid change also, though to a less degree, affects the interlobular blood-vessels. In the case of the arte- ries the middle coat is the most affected, p.^. igs.

The semi- translucent patches are chiefly found in the intermediate zone of the lobule, the neighbourhood of the central or intralobular vein on the one hand and of the portal vein on the other being com- paratively free from deposit. In other instances however there seems to be no special arrangement of the amyloid patches.

CHAPTER XIII. HYPERTROPHY AND HYPERPLASIA OF THE VESSELS. 289. True hypertrophy of the arteries, that is to say in- crease in all the coats of the walls without loss of structure, is seen in a marked form in the vessels which carry on collateral circulation after the occlusion of a larger artery. The increase is most remark- able when it depends on the occlusion of one of the large arterial trunks. The collateral vessels increase in length as well as in width and thus become convoluted, while the increase in the thickness of the wall is even greater in proportion. Local hyper- trophy may likewise follow upon increase of blood-pressure, such as occurs in front of a contracted portion of the vessel. If the pres- sure of the blood be generally increased throughout the system, as it is in chronic Bright's disease, the smaller arteries may become universally hypertrojDhied. The so-called anastomotic or racemose aneurysm (Art. 151) is mainly due to dilatation, convolution, and hypertrophy of arteries and capillaries. And in hypertrophy of the organs, as in ordinary development or in new-formations, the arteries tend to become more or less hypertrophied. Veins and capillaries may hypertrophy like arteries, especially under the conditions just mentioned, which are associated ^vith increased blood-supply. Hypertrophy implies increase in the elements of the vessel- walls, but not in the number of the vessels; the latter is hyperplasia, and is an extremely common occurrence. In the General Patho- logical Anatomy we pointed out that the development of new- formations of any size involved of necessity the formation of new vessels; and in Art. 86 we described the mode in which this takes place. At first capillaries only appear; but by the multiplication of the elements of the walls and their progressive differentiation arteries and veins are ultimately elaborated.

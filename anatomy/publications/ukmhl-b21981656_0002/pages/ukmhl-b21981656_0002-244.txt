[sect. VI. 224 THE MUCOUS MEMBKANES. possess them, are often the chief seat of the inflammation and ulceration. Ulcers starting in them are known as follicular ulcers. When catarrh of a mucous membrane passes into ulcera- tion the inflammatory infiltration usually extends far beyond the limits of the ulcer. Thus in dysenteric ulceration of the colon the submucosa (e) is infiltrated as well as the mucosa {d dj. 422. When the inflammatory process is of long duration, a certain amount of fibrous hyperplasia takes place, and that whether the process is accompanied by ulceration or not. In the former case the hyperplastic tissue often takes the form of papillomatous outgrowths from the borders of the ulcer, and these sometimes reach a remarkable size. Even where there is no ulcer- ation similar papillomatous, warty, or cauliflower excrescences may be formed. In other cases the fibrous hyperplasia is more diffuse, giving rise merely to bands and unevennesses of the sur- face ; but both forms are often found associated. Fig. 168.

These prominences are at least in part due to fibrous overgrowth (e). When the membrane contains glands, the openings of some of them become obstructed, and they are thus distended into cysts.

CHAPTER LXIII. THE PANCREAS. 513. The pancreas is an acinous or tubulo-acinous gland, whose duct (canal of Wirsung) passes into the wall of the duodenum and there joins the common bile-duct, opening "with it through a common orifice into the bowel. Only in rare cases has it a distinct orifice. The secretion of the pancreas, which is in effect an abdominal salivary gland, acts powerfully in promoting the diges- tion not only of starchy matters but also of albuminoids and of fat. The morbid changes of the pancreas are seldom very marked; though it is liable to various affections both primary and secondary. Of anomalies of development the presence of an accessory pancreas is the most noteworthy. This is a discoid structure, from the size of a lentil to that of a crown-piece, made up of glandular lobules, and seated on the wall of the upj)er part of the small intestine or of the stomach. It lies either close beneath the peritoneum, or more deeply embedded in the muscular or sub- mucous layers. Its minute structure is exactly similar to that of the pancreas itself, and it communicates with the alimentary canal by a duct of its own. The division of the pancreas into two equal or unequal lobes is much less common. The gland is entirely absent in various cases of imperfect development, where the whole body of the foetus or the alimentary canal in particular is gravely malformed. Haemorrhage (pancreatic apoplexy) is not an infrequent occurrence in connexion with the pancreas. When it occurs shortly before death the fibrous structures of the gland, and the neighbouring parts, are found soaked with dark blood. More rarely a typical haematoma or blood-cyst is formed. When the haemorrhage is less recent the infiltrated tissue has a brown or slaty tint. These haemorrhages are usually due to affections of the heart.

[sect. VIII. THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. 342 True connective-tissue tumours of the liver are as we have said very rare. Various forms have however been described, notably fibroma and sarcoma. Fig. 198. Section fbom the advancing bobdbr op a very small cavernous ANGIOMA or THE LIVER. (x 150) Some years ago the author met with a case in which the liver was beset, along the course of the sympathetic nerves, with a multi- tude of small firm fibroneuromata, from the size of a millet-seed to that of a bean. The patient in question had like fibroneuromata seated on all his nerves, except the olfactory and the optic. Melanosarcoma (endothelioma melanodes. Art. 162) has also been observed. In a case recently examined the liver was greatly enlarged and thickly interspersed with greyish-brown and black growths of the most diverse forms and varying in size from that of a millet-seed to that of a walnut. To judge from the appear- ances presented by the smallest, the neoplastic growth started from the endothelium of the lobular capillaries, and gave rise to gradual atrophy of the liver-cells. The pigment lay chiefly within the tumour-cells, which were curiously irregular in shape. In some cases the pigment is scanty or absent in parts, and the tumour has there a whitish or greyish tint.

Carcinoma of the stomach, intes- tine, or pancreas is particularly apt to give rise to them, though they are not infrequent as a consequence of carcinoma of the oesophagus, uterus, or breast.

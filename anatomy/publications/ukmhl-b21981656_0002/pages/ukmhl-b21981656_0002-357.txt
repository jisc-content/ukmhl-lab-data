INFLAMMATIONS OF THE LIVER. 337 CHAP. LX.] the surface of the liver is usually drawn in and puckered. The gummata of congenital syphilis are thus very similar to those of the acquired disease. When the liver is at all gravely affected by syphilitic hepatitis, inflammatory changes are induced in the capsule or serous covering (perihepatitis), which take the form either of simple exudations or of membranous adhesions to the surrounding parts.

The former is much more common thaa the latter, and is usually but a part of a general tuberculosis involving several organs or the entire body. The liver is beset with minute nodules, often so small as to be scarcely perceptible, and grey, yellow, or bile-stained, as the case may be. The nodules lie either in the interlobular tissue or in the lobules or in both. Tuberculosis of the liver. Fia. 196.

INFLAMMATOKY AFFECTIONS. CHAP. XLVI.] 221 cells, like those of the bladder. The process may be well observed in the cells of the intestinal and bronchial epithelium; the so- called goblet-cells of these membranes being simply mucus-forming structures. In catarrh the production of mucus is much increased, the number of goblet-cells (Fig. 166, 6) becoming considerably Fig. 166. CATAEBHAii seceetions fbom vaeious mucous MEMBEANES.

Great quantities of glassy mucus are thus deposited on the membrane, or, as in the case of nasal catarrh, are cast off from its free surface. If the membrane contains mucus-glands their secretion is simultaneously increased, and mingles with that of the lining epithelium. At first the changes just described are the only ones, or at least the only ones that are obvious. Sooner or later however other changes set in, unless the inflammation speedily subsides

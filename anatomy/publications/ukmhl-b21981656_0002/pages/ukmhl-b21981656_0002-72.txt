52 THE VASCULAR MECHANISM. [SECT. II. Among the granular masses certain peculiar colourless flakes or protoplasmic lumps (/) appear, which are probably nothing more Fig. 125.

This is rendered more likely by the gradual transition observable between the persisting nucleated endocardial tissue and the non-nucleated lumps. The deeper layers {d) of the growth are infiltrated with small leucocytes, the infiltration extending in places to the super- ficial granular masses and to the deeper subendocardial tissues (6). The genesis and the significance of the process are apparent from the consideration of such a vegetation. We see that it is an exudative inflammation, in which the exudation permeates the tissues and in part coagulates. Where coagulation takes place the tissue undergoes necrosis : where there has been only an infiltration of leucocytes the tissue persists. The inflammatory process is therefore diphtheritic in its nature (Art. 103). It is closely related to superficial diphtheritic inflam- mation of the mucous membranes (Art. 425), and to pustulation of the cutaneous surface (Art. 388). As we have already said, vegetations are not an invariable accompaniment of endocarditis. The inflammatory change is often recognisable only by the existence of more or less marked infiltra- tion of the fibrous tissues of the lining membrane.

SCLEROSIS AND ATHEROMA. 73 CHAP. XV.] 300. Sclerosis and atheroma often give rise to serious disturb- ance of the circulation and with it of the nutrition of the parts supplied by the affected vessels. Apart from the resistances to the blood introduced by the deformation of the inner surfaces of the blood-channels and the loss of elasticity of their walls, there is occasionally a considerable narrowing of the calibre (Fig. 131), and this may become so great that the artery is at length completely occluded (as in obliterating endarteritis). As the various pro- minences encroaching upon the lumen meet and coalesce the vessel may ultimately be transformed into a solid cord. If collateral circulation is not speedily set up, the blood-supply of the part is cut off, and anaemic necrosis ensues. This is a very common occurrence in the brain. It may take place not only in small arteries but even in the largest trunks, especially at the points where branches are given off. Thus, for example, the subclavians and carotids may be occluded by thickening of the intima at their points of origin from the aorta. A second result is thrombosis. It is produced by the change in the vessel-wall on one hand, and by the slowing of the blood-stream on the other. Minor vessels which are already narrowed may be completely blocked up by intercurrent thrombosis. In the aorta parietal thrombi are common. If they are loosened and swept off they cause embolism; and the same result follows when particles are carried away from atheromatous ulcers. Atheroma of the arteries may likewise lead to morbid dilatation (Art. 301) of the vessel, or even to rupture. Both results are due to the textural changes, and the diminished power of resisting the blood-pressure which the changes involve.

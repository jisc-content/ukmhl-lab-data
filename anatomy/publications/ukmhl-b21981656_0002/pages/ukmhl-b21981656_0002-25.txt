CHAPTER I. FUNCTIONS OF BLOOD AND LYMPH. 251. Blood and lymph are the essential juices of the body. They stand in the closest relation to the vital processes which go on in the tissues. By means of the blood the constituent elements of the body are supplied with the nutrient substances and the oxygen which they require. By the blood and the lymph are conveyed away the waste and surplus matters which have ceased to be useful to the tissues. The nutrient substances and the oxygen are derived from without. The former usually enter the body from the ali- mentary canal, the latter usually through the lungs. But most parts of the body are under certain conditions capable of directly assimilating both nutriment and oxygen. The channels of entrance are in such cases the smaller blood-vessels and lymphatics. The matters which have to be removed from the tissues are partly surplus nutriment, partly the products of tissue-waste and metabolism. These matters are caiTied off either to be utilised elsewhere within the system, or to be ejected altogether. Under normal conditions the incomings and outgoings balance each other in amount. The channels by which the normal constituents gain access to the blood and lymph may also serve to admit matters which are noxious or at least abnormal. These matters may be either wholly extraneous, or produced within the body itself in virtue of some morbid or abnormal metabolism. The result of their admission is a more or less enduring pollution of the blood and lymph. In many cases the blood is able to eliminate them harmlessly and speedily, chiefly by means of the kidneys and the liver; but in other cases the pollution is more permanent. The composition of the blood often suffers in consequence, and its reiiovation may not be effected until some of the tissues or organs have been more or less injured by malnutrition.

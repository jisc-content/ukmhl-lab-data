THE LIVER AND PANCREAS, [sect. VIII. 322 hypertrophy is seen to be more apparent than real, the appearance being mainly due to contraction, compression, and displacement of the several parts. Circumscribed hypertrophies or hyperplasias of the liver-tissue do however occur in the form of nodules or larger nodes (Fried- reich, Virch. Arch. vol. 33; Hoffmann, ibid. vol. 39; Eberth, ibid. vol. 43). These protuberant overgrowths consist of liver- tissue, the cells of which are abnormally large and arranged in somewhat irregular groups or trabeculae.

These authors assert that in the lower animals at least wounds of the liver are partly repaired by new-formations of liver-tissue, and that these new- formations may reach a considerable size.

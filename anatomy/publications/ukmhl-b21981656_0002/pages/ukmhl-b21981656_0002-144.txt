THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. [sect. IV. 124 This account of the origin of the vertebrate body-cavity has a pathological as well as an embryological bearing. If the cavity is not a mere lymph-space, its pathology is not strictly comparable Avith that of the lymphatic system. If its epithelial covering is oiiginally derived from the alimentary or splanchnic epithelium its morbid changes will be related to those of the mucous mem- branes, and must be studied in connexion with them. Thus, for example, it may be important in discussing the genesis of neoplasms occurring in a serous membrane to bear in mind that its so-called endothelium is genetically a true epithelium. Few affections of the serous membranes are independent or confined to them alone. Various organs are enclosed within the body-cavities and are thus in the closest relation to the serous membrane. The disorders affecting the membrane are conse- quently in the greater number of cases secondary to affections of the organs which it covers. These secondary affections will be discussed in treating of the respective organs; in the following chapters we shall deal chiefly with the primary or independent affections of the serous membranes. The above account of the origin of the body-cavity differs essentially from that given in the first German edition, in which the widely-accepted view which regards the plem'o-peritoneal cavity as a mere lymph-space was adopted. The works of the Hektwigs {Die Coelomtheorie Jena 1881) and Balfour {Comparative Embryology vol. ii ch. 13) have shed new light upon the subject; and though they differ in details the main fact of the derivation of the body- cavity from the primitive alimentary cavity seems established by them. The fact that the serous membranes are capable of performing secretory fimctions seems to harmonise with the theory that they are originally derived from the secretory layer of the blastoderm, the hypoblast.

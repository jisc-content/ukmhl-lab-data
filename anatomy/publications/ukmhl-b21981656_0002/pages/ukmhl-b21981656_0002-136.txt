116 THE SPLEEN AND THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. [SECT. III. from the tuberculous affections ; but it is not unlikely that tuberculosis may assume the former type, and that some of the so-called scrofulous inflamma- tions of the glands in which no typical tubercles can be found are really due to the invasion of the tuberculous virus. In future we shall no doubt be able to settle such questions in any given case either by demonstrating the presence or absence of the Bacillus tubejxulosis, or by testing the infective character of the morbid material by means of inoculation. Tuberculous lymphadenitis is apparently a very common affection, and occurs in patients otherwise free from tuberculosis; that is to say, it may remain as a purely local affection. See ScHUPPEL {Die Lymphdriisenhiherculose Tubingen 1871), Cornil {Journ. de Vanat. norm, et path. 1878), J. Arnold (Virch. Arch. vol. 87), Baumgarten (iSamm. klin. Vortnige 218), Treves {Scrofula and its gland diseases London 1882), Bergmann {Gerhardt's Ilandb. d. Kinderkr. vi), Orth {Lehrh. d. spec, path. Anat. i). Syphilitic inflammation of the lymphatic glands (hard bubo) possesses no distinctive histological characters. The accumulation of leucocytes m the folhcles, alveoli, and sinuses is usually considerable, and the capsule and tissue of the hilum are also infiltrated with cells.

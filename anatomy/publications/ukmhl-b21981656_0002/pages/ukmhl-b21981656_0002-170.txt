CHAPTER XXXVIIl. INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. a. Transitory eruptions with slight exudation: erythema, papulae, urticae. 366. In speaking of erythema as a form of simple cutaneous hyperaemia (Art. 360) we pointed out that any intensification of the process might lead to exudation, and so transfer the affection from the category of hyperaemia to that of inflammation or der- matitis. There is no very obvious difference in appearance between erythematous hyperaemia and erythematous inflammation, except it be that in the latter the affected part is somewhat swollen. If the exudation is confined to the region of a few papillae, or is at least more intense at some spots than at others around them, the swelling takes the form of small circumscribed solid elevations known as papules or papulae. If the group of swollen papillae is larger, the flattened elevations then formed are called wheals or urticae. When the exudation is still more abundant the irregular pro- minences are called tubercules or tubercula. Wheals and tuber- cules often become pale at the centre while the margin is still hyperaemic. Microscopic examination shows that these swellings are mainly due to serous exudation, which distends the meshes of the corium and papillary layer and causes the cells of the rete mucosum to swell up. More intense and more enduring inflammation is accom- panied by greater extravasation of cells, so that the flbrous tissues appear infiltrated with leucocytes. The swelling of the individual cells of the rete sometimes results in the liquefaction and destruction of some of them, in which case the papules and wheals are transformed into vesicles (Art. 370). The exuded liquid often contains red corpuscles ; in this case the redness of the spot does not wholly disappear when pressed with the finger, but a certain amount of reddish or brownish staining remains.

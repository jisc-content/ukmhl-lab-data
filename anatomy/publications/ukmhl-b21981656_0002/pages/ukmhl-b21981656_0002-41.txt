CHAPTER IV. CHANGES IN THE BLOOD-CORPUSCLES. 260. The formed elements of the blood, the red and white corpuscles, are not permanent structures; the red corpuscles are continually perishing while new ones take their place; and the white corpuscles are diminished in number by migration from the vessels, so that the proportion of them in circulation must be maintained by the development of new cells. The number of white cells in the blood is not altogether constant even in health.. It is now reckoned that on the average there is one white cell to six hundred red; but the proportion is often greater (as during digestion), and often less. In many and various morbid conditions (as in continued sup- puration, in typhus, typhoid, and intermittent fevers, in pyaemia, erysipelas, etc.) the white blood-cells are increased in number, multinuclear forms appearing as well as the uninuclear; the pro- portion may in such cases rise to 1 in 100, 1 in 50, or even 1 in 20. According to Virchow the white corpuscles are most apt to be morbidly increased when the lymphatic glands are affected. The condition of morbid increase he calls leucocytosis; it is a temporary condition and dependent on transient causes. Leukaemia (Virchow) or leucocythaemia (Hughes Ben- nett) is to be distinguished from the merely temporary condition of leucocytosis. Its characters areâ€”a more or less notable and abiding increase of white corpuscles, accompanied by a decrease of the red corpuscles. The proportion between the two may be so altered that their numbers become equal, or in extreme cases the white may slightly outnumber the red. In well-marked leukaemia the blood is quite visibly altered in appearance; it looks pale, transparent, and limpid. Post mortem the accumulations of white corpuscles may here and there be so great that they arc apparent to the unaided eye. In the heart and great vessels peculiar muddy clots are found instead of the

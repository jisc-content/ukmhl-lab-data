CHAP. LX.] ATROPHIC CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER. 329 (a). In this way many groups of liver-cells become surrounded, and appear in the midst of the overgrown fibrous tissue; they are thus more or less separated and cut off from their capillaries. The result is that some of them perish, while others which survive give rise to clusters and strings of cells looking very like bile-ducts; these have indeed been regarded by some as new-formed bile-ducts. Fig. 191. Granular atrophic cirrhosis of the liver. (Arteries injected; carmine staining: x 25) a remains of normal lobule d infiltration of leucocytes b new-formed fibrous tissue e interlobular (portal) veins c bile-ducts This view is certainly not correct, though the strings of cells do in fact act as channels for the bile between the isolated remnants of liver-tissue and the true bile-ducts. The latter are unaffected by the other changes in the organ and in some cases may actually be increased in number, Ackermann succeeded in injecting the new- formed channels from the hepatic duct. It is however to be noted that the multiplication is often only apparent. The ducts which enter the lobules, and they do so to a greater depth than the de- scriptions in the histological text-books would imply, are normally

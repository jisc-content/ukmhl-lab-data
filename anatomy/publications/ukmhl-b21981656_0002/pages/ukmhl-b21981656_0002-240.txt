CHAPTER XLVI. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. 419. The inflammations of the mucous membranes are the commonest of all affections, and they play a very considerable part in pathology. In by far the greater number of cases they are induced by noxious agencies acting on the external surface of the membrane; they are rarely due to noxious matters carried to it by the circulation. Thus cystitis, that is inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bladder, is often caused by the action of morbid or decomposed urine; intestinal inflammation by the ingestion of irritant substances; and bronchial inflammation by the inhalation of impure air. Symptomatic inflammations are met with chiefly in connexion with certain general infective diseases. The intensity, extent, and duration of the inflammations of the mucous membranes vary greatly in different cases ; and a number of different forms are distinguished accordingly. 420. In catarrhal inflammations, as the name implies, the characteristic feature is a morbid increase of the secretion of the membrane. Hyperaemia is of course present, and often to a re- markable degree in the early stages, but the alteration in the nature and amount of the secretion is the distinguishing character. The catarrhal secretion is furnished partly by the blood-vessels and partly by the epithelial cells. In the early stages the blood- vessels permit the extravasation of an abundant colourless or sometimes blood-stained liquid, containing a multitude of white corpuscles (Fig. 166, l) interspersed with a few red ones. When the secretion consists essentially of this liquid exudation, we have what is called serous catarrh. The liquid exudation from the blood-vessels is always mingled with secretions from the epithelial cells. These cells normally pro- duce mucus from their protoplasmic contentsâ€”the cylindrical cells chiefly, but to some extent also the stratified pavement epithelial

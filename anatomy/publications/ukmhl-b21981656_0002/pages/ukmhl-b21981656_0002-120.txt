CHAPTER XXIII. HYPERPLASIAS AND TUMOURS OF THE SPLEEN. 328. We have already (Art. 321) referred to various forms of enlargement of the spleen associated with acute infective diseases. Such enlargements are partly due to an increase of the pulp, and partly to an increase in the fibrous framework. But there is another and very important form of splenic hyperplasia, whose aetiology is altogether obscure, although it constitutes a grave disease. This form of hyperplasia usually extends over the entii'e spleen ; it is rarely limited to isolated patches. So far as is known the affection commences with an increase of the parenchyma as a whole, the constituent elements undergoing a general h}^erplasia. The tissue is bright-red and soft, while the follicles are not separately distinguishable. In a much rarer form of the disorder the malpighian follicles become hypertrophied, and stand out as greyish nodules or in white lobulated clusters. As the parenchyma increases in size the originally soft tissue becomes firmer, and at the same time paler. The follicles are often still unenlarged, but they may at this stage become hypertrophied and form whitish nodes and clusters of considerable size. The capsule is in general somewhat thickened and beset with coarse fibrous patches of various sizes; and adhesions are often formed with the surrounding organs. The enlargement thus brought about may be very remarkable, the weight of the spleen sometimes reaching three or four kilogrammes. In the earlier stages the hyperplastic enlargement of the pulp and follicles, in so far as it is independent of the amount of blood present in the spleen, is due to an increase in the number of the constituent cells. When the follicles develope into nodes of any size they compress the spleen-pulp between them, and it often becomes atrophied in consequence. It is then found to contain fatty cells and pigment-granules either free or enclosed in other

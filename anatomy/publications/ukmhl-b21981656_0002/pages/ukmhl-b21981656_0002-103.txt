OHAPTEE XVIII. THE LYMPHATICS. 313. The morbid changes occurring in the lymphatic system do not admit of complete treatment apart from that of the various organs. The lymphatics have their ultimate radicles in the very substance of the tissues ; and arise in the natural meshes and lacunae which exist in them. Into these meshes or Ijonph-spaces passes the liquid transuded from the blood-vessels; the meshes being continuous with lymph-channels, which are devoid of special walls and are only marked off from the parenchyma of the tissues by a layer of endothelial ceUs. These channels are the radicles of the lymphatics, and are abundant wherever connective tissue is found. It must be very rare for demonstrable changes to take place in these minute lymph-channels without simultaneous disease of the tissues that enclose them; they and the tissues are in too intimate relation for one to suffer without the other. The same holds even for the larger lymphatics, though they have walls of their own in addition to the endothelial lining; it is indeed only the largest lymphatics of all that give marked evidence of their independence. 314. The lymphatics are not infrequently inflamed, an affection described as lymphangitis, but more properly perilymphangitis. It is generally secondary to some inflammation of the tissues; the lymph from the inflamed area acting as an irritant on the vessels through which it flows and on the tissues which envii-on them. It is rare for an irritant capable of setting up inflammation to reach the lymphatics from any other source than from a previously inflamed part. The secondary inflammation may extend far beyond the seat of the primary affection: thus it may reach from a wound in the hand up into the lymphatics and glands of the axilla. During life the affection is recognisable by the existence of red and painful streaks extending from the initial wound to the nearest lymphatic glands. 6â€”2

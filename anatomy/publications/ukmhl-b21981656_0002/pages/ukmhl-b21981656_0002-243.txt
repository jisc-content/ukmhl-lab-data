CHAP. XLVI.] INFLAMMATORV AFFECTIONS. 223 the infiltrated cells disappear either by migration to the surface, or by passing into the lymphatics, or by disintegration and absorption. Where the epithelium has been lost by desquamation repair is effected by multiplication of the remaining epithelial cells. This result is however not invariable; the inflammation may become intensified so that the tissues perish over some consider- able extent, or continuing to be of moderate intensity it may be unduly protracted, and so occasion extensive alteration in the tissues. The intensification of the inflammatory process is manifested histologically as an increase of the cellular infiltration. Thus, for instance, in the colon the surface layers of the connective tissue separating the lieberkiilmian crypts may be densely infiltrated with leucocytes (Fig. 167 d). The overlying epithelium is soon Fig. 167. Section of the colon fbom a case of dysenteby.

In the later stages it also may be shed altogether and extruded from the crypts. When the infiltration is extreme the tissue perishes by necrosis. Patches of various sizes die outright and are cast off with the pus which is secreted from the surface (/). In this way ulcers (g) are produced which may be large or small according to the extent of the initial necrosis. The lymph-follicles, in membranes that

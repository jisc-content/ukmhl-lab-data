CHAPTER XL. NON-INFLAMMATORY HYPERTROPHIES AND TUMOURS. 397. Ichthyosis is a general affection or deformity of the skin, characterised by the formation of epidermal scales and plates, and of warty growths. It consists in an excessive proliferation of the cutis and epidermis; and is hereditary and congenital, though it does not usually manifest itself till the first or second year of life. Leloir has in two cases found the cutaneous nerves in a degenerate condition, and regards the disease as of nervous origin. The horny layer is enormously thickened, laminated, and fis- sured (Fig. 156 a); the rete Malpighii on the other hand is slightly developed in comparison, and passes without transition into the homy layer. In ichthyosis simplex the papillae are not enlarged. In very slight cases the skin is simply beset with small nodules (Kaposi) covered with a thin scale and containing a coiled-up hair {lichen jnlaris). This condition is met with chiefly on the exterior surfaces of the limbs. In more marked cases contiguous scales or plates of various sizes up to that of a sixpence are formed, giving the surface the look of crocodile-skin {ichthyosis nitida). These may subsequently become rough and dirty or discoloured {ichthyosis nigricans). When the papillae are hypertrophied as well as the epidermis, the surface becomes extraordinarily rough and irregular; sometimes the elevations stand up like quills upon a hedgehog {ichthyosis hystrix, Fig. 156). EuLENBURG, Amozan, and Geber state that ichthyosis may occur as an acquired affection in the adult, in consequence of neuritis or injury to cutaneous nerves. The peculiar affection which has been called neuropathic papilloma of the skin by Gerhardt, and neuropathic naevus by Simon, seems to be closely akin to if not identical with ichthyosis. It consists of papillary elevations of the skin covered with fissured and loosened epidermis: the elevations may be pigmented. It is

CHAP. XXXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF THE SKIN. 173 388. The histological changes observed during the evolution of the variolous pustule have already been joartially treated in Arts. 371 and 372. The first change is the swelling up of the cells of the mucous layer of the epidermis immediately over the tips of the papillae. Weigert has shown that the swollen cells are transformed into pale denucleated masses resembling coagula. This is followed by complete necrosis and solution of the affected cells in the exudation which at this stage is poured out from the papillary vessels, while the degenerative swelling and change extend on all sides. Only small portions of the epidermal tissue withstand solution, and these are chiefly cell-membranes, or degenerate denucleated or sometimes nucleated masses representing coagulated cells; these are stretched and compressed by the accumulating exudation into bands and threads and partial septa crossing the excavations in the epidermis. Thus at the climax of the process the pock or vesicle consists of a cavity traversed by shreds of membrane and fibres and distorted cells (Fig. 153 /) covered at its highest part by the horny layer only (i), but towards its margins by some of the surface Fig. 153.

The floor of the cavity is formed of remnants of the inter-papillary portion of the rete Malpighii {g), and in part of denuded papillae {h). The papillae and the upper layers of the cutis are swollen and beset with leucocytes; and the

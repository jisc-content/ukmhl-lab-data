Chapter lii. THE OESOPHAGUS. 449. The most important of the deformities to which the oesophagus is liable is stenosis or narrowing of its calibre. Five varieties of stenosis have been distinguished (Zenker, von Ziemssen) according as it is due to congenital malformation, compression, obstruction, stricture, or spasmodic contraction. The oesophagus is wholly absent only in foetuses which are very gravely malformed. Even a partial obliteration is rare when the foetus is at all well-developed. Simple congenital stenosis occurs both at the upper and at the lower end of the tube, and may be simply annular or may extend over some small distance. Both varieties are rare. Stenosis by compression is generally due to the pressure of enlarged scrofulous glands in the neck or mediastinum, mediastinal sarcoma, aortic aneurysm, etc. It produces grave functional diffi- culty only when the tube is in a manner encircled by the growth, so that there is no direction in which it can yield. Stenosis by obstruction occurs when foreign bodies be- come wedged in the tube. The thrush-fungus may grow and multiply in the oesophagus to such an extent as occasionally to block up or seriously to narrow the passage. Polypous tumours growing from the mucous membrane may have a Hke effect, but very rarely. Cancerous growths are much more apt to be the cause of obstruction. Strictures are due to the contraction of cicatrices or to cancerous change. Cicatrices most commonly follow upon injuries due to irritg,nt or corrosive substances, such as boiling water, acids, or alkalies. The extent and tightness of the stricture depend on the size of the corrosion-wounds. If the corrosion has extended deeply into the tissues of the wall, the oesophagus may be trans- formed into a firm almost cartilaginous pipe, through which only the finest sound may be able to pass. Syphilitic strictures are very rare, as the oesophagus is on the whole seldom attacked by s. p. A. 17

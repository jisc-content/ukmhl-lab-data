CHAP. XXXTII.] TUBERCULOSIS OF SEROUS MEMBRANES. 135 The tuberculous eruption is sometimes local, for instance it may be confined to the true pelvis, to the neighbourhood of the spleen, or to a single spot of the pleura or pericardium; or it may extend over an entire membrane or over more than one, as for example over pleura and peritoneum simultaneously. In the latter case there is usually some fluid effusion, and sometimes it is stained with blood. The number of tubercles may be quite small, or so great that the surface of the membrane feels finely granular. The tissue around the tubercles is injected and often beset with minute haemorrhagic patches. Post mortem these latter may have a slaty grey look from the formation in them of ferrous sulphide (Art. 68), or they may be brown or black from other alterations in the blood-pigment. If the affection lasts any time the membrane is usi;ally thickened, and the mesentery and omentum become contracted and deformed. Surrounding the tubercles zones of highly-vascular delicate semi-translucent fibrous tissue are often developed. Fig. 142.

The epithelium is generally in process of proliferation and catarrhal desquamation (E'ig. 142 d).

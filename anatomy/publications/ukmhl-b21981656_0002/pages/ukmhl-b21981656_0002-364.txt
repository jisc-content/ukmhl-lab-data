344 THE LIVER AND PANCREAS. [SECT. VIII. tended by them, and the surrounding liver-tissue is compressed or thrust aside. As the nodule grows a new-formed fibrous stroma grows up among and between the cancer-cells, and separates them off into large and small clusters or nests, whose general grouping recalls the type of the mother-tumour. This fibrous stroma, which is vascular, is derived from the interlobular connective tissue of the liver. The liver-tissue either continues to be thrust aside, or is invaded, infiltrated, or permeated by the new growth. Fig. 199. Cancebous embolus in a hepatic capillaby. (From a primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach: haematoxylin staining: x 300) Fig. 200, Metastatic growth op canoeb in a hepatic capillary. (From a primary cancer of the pancreas: fibrous tissue is developing in the capillar!/: haematoxylin staining: x 250) The infiltration depends on the fact that fibrous tissue as well as cell-nests are developed within the capillaries (Fig. 200). The liver-cells surrounded and clasped by the new tissue presently become atrophied and disappear; before the last stage they often appear crammed with pigment-granules. Metastases derived from tumours not carcinomatous are rarely met with in the liver. Even sarcomatous nodules are not common, though they are occasionally found in children. Animal parasites. 507. But few animal parasites take up their permanent abode in the human liver. The species which do so are—Taenia, echinococciis (Arts. 245—248), Distoma hepaticum (Art. 237), Distoma lanceolatum (Art. 238), Distoma haematobium (Art. 239), Pentastoma denticulatum (Art. 225), and the Psorospermia (Art. 250). These have been fully described in the General Pathological

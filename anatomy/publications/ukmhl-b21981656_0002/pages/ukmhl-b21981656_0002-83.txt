CHAPTER XIV. INFLAMMATIONS OF THE VESSELS. 290. We have already had occasion to allude to two varieties of inflammatory change affecting the walls of the vessels. From one point of view we have spoken of an alteration in the vessel- wall as an essential factor in all inflammatory processes, this alteration being the condition antecedent to the quantitative and qualitative changes in the current of transudation from the smaller vessels into the tissues. The increased permeability of the vessel- wall permits the escape from the capillaries and veins not only of liquid but of large numbers of white and occasionally red blood- cells (Art. 96). The second form of inflammatory change dealt with was that concerned in the organisation of thrombi (Art. 255). Here the vessel-wall became inflamed in consequence of the irritating presence of a foreign body, the thrombus itself; and the inflammation resulted in the development of granulation-tissue and a cicatrix within the vein or artery. In view of the ultimate result of the inflammation we might describe it as a plastic obliterating endarteritis or endophlebitis. But in addition to these two kinds of inflammatory vascular change we have a series of others, which have their seat in the substance of the vessel-wall and lead to temporary or perma- nent changes extending to a part or the whole of its thickness. Arteritis and phlebitis are used to describe these parenchymatous inflammations of the vessel-wall. They may arise as primarily vascular afiections and be confined to the proper tissues of the vessels; or the surroimding tissues may be likewise involved; or the vascular affection may be secondary to an existing inflammation of the surrounding tissues. The latter occurs in the case of minute vessels embedded in the tissues, and is to be clearly made out only by the aid of the microscope. 291. Purulent arteritis, issuing in suppuration and destruc- tion of the wall of the artery, is generally a secondary process

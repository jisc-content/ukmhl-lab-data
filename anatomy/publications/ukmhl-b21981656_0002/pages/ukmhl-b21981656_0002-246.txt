Inflammatory disturbance of the circulation may be the primary lesion, and the alteration of the epithelium secondary. The fibrous structures of the inflamed mucous membrane always contain liquid and cellular exudations. If the liquid lie in the larger lymph-spaces or in dilated lymphatics it also may coagulate and give rise to fibrous-looking clots, rarely to homogen- eous and continuous masses. We might in such cases say that the croupous inflammation was deep or parenchymatous, as well as superficial in the ordinary sense. Croupous inflammation occurs chiefly in the respiratory mucous membranes, rarely in the alimentary tract. 424. Diphtheritic inflammation. When a mucous mem- brane is injured in such a way that its epithelium dies without desquamation, while its blood-vessels are damaged and pour out an abundant exudation, it sometimes happens that the dead epithelial cells become saturated with the exuded liquid and then pass into a peculiar condition of rigidity akin to coagulation. The seat of this change appears to the naked eye as a dull greyish raised patch suiTounded by red and swollen mucous membrane (Fig. 170). The exudation is rich in albumen, and the transformed Fig. 170. Section theough the uvula in diphtheritis faucium.

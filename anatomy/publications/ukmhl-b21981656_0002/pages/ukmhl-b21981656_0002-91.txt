71 CHAP. XV.] SCLEROSIS AND ATHEROMA. 298. Sections show well the seat and characters of sclerotic and atheromatous change (Fig. 131). The intima (a) is generally the most affected, while the media (c) is often unaltered, and the adventitia (A) only slightly infiltrated. In other cases the adventitia Fig. 131.

The change in the intima consists of more or less extensive but generally unilateral thickening. At the points where the altered passes into the unaltered tissue the thickening is made up of fibrous tissue (g) more or less notably infiltrated with leucocytes. The same is true of the innermost layers of the altered intima; but the deeper layers in contact with the elastic bounding membrane consist of pale indistinctly fibrillated tissue (e), which is devoid of nuclei and almost entirely necrosed; they contain numerous aggre- gations of granular detritus (/). The granular masses consist partly of albumen, partly of fat, and older foci of softening nearly always contain tablets of cholesterin (f^). Atheroma thus appears to be essentially a necrosis with granular and fatty disintegration of the thickened intima. The atheromatous ulcer is produced by the advance of the disintegrating process towards the lumen of the vessel, and rupture of the innermost layers of the intima. We may conceive how readily such a rupture might occur, if we note that on the post-

CHAPTEE XXXI. EFFECTS DUE TO DISORDERS OF THE OIRCULATION. 349. Disorders of the circulation affecting the serous mem- branes are very common. Congestive hyperaemia such as accompanies the early stages of inflammation, and sudden diminution of the normal pressure within the serous cavity, may lead to intense reddening of the surface of the membrane. In passive hyperaemia it is the veins especially which are engorged, and often notably dilated. Small circumscribed haemorrhages are very commonly met with, both in inflammation and in fatal cases of infective disease, renal and cardiac disease, asphyxia, etc. When fresh they are red, but after a time they become brown or slate-coloured. They are due either to alterations in the vessel-walls, or to extreme vascular engorgement with obstruction, or to both together. Large haemorrhages, in which blood escapes in quantity into the cavity, may result from very various causes. They are fre- quently due to mechanical injury by which a large vessel is opened, as in ruptures of the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, etc. Such are also the grave haemorrhages that follow rupture of the heart or aorta or other artery depending on disease, and rupture of the foetal sac in tubal pregnancy. Sometimes no lesion can be made out, as in cases of haemorrhagic diathesis. New-formed vessels in inflammatory tissue are especially apt to give way and bleed. Lastly, extreme engorgement such as ensues on thrombosis of the portal vein, or embolic occlusion of an artery, may cause very severe haemorrhage. The blood poured out into the serous cavity is quickly absorbed by the lymphatics which communicate with the cavity, unless special morbid alterations of the membrane stand in the way. Blood which remains liquid is very speedily taken up, in part without much alteration, and in part after solution or decolori- sation of the red corpuscles. Coagula are less manageable, but

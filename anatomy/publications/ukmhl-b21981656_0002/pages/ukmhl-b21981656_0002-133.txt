CHAP. XXVIII.] INFLAMMATIONS OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. 113 egg. The section looks uniformly greyish and somewhat trans- lucent; after exposure to the air it becomes brownish. Little fluid can be obtained from it by scraping. In the nodular form of the affection the nodules stand out from the surrounding tissue by virtue of their tint and translucency. Soft caseation does not usually follow upon large-celled hyperplasia, but homogeneous or hyaline degeneration is common; it leads to the entire destruction of the cells, and must be reckoned as a form of firm caseation (Art. 39). The tissue becomes homogeneous and shining and loses its nuclei, or seems broken up into hyaline denucleated blocks. Now and again this stage passes into one of complete disinte- gration with granular crumbling of the tissue, not unlike soft caseation. 341. Fibrous indurative hyperplasia. Hyperplasia of the adenoid reticulum has already been referred to (Art. 335) in speaking of the consequences of long-continued deposition of foreign sub- stances in the glands. The increase of fibrous tissue in such cases is however but slight, when compared -with the very notable fibrous hyperplasia which may result from chronic or often-repeated inflam- mation, and which may lead not merely to induration but to great increase in the size of the gland. The swellings thus produced may reach the size of a hen's egg, or more. The capsule and fibrous septa are in general the parts most thickened and enlarged, or at least the more diffuse hyperplasia starts with them. The hyperplasia being thus due to the formation of new fibrous tissue, the affection is best described as a fibrous Fio, 138. Fibrous hyperplasia of a lymphatic gland.

Ponfick was also the first to demonstrate the genesis of the disease by means of his inoculation-experiments. Fig. 174 B. Nodule containing Actinomyces fhom the tongue of a cow.

Saccharomyces albicans (Reess), muguet, or thrush-fungus is a special parasite of the mouth; it has hitherto generally been referred to as Oidium albicans. It is one of the Blastomycetes or yeasts, and is therefore akin to if not identical with Mycodernia vini or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Art. 224). As it occurs in the mouth it assumes the form of rounded or oval glistening cells and delicate filaments. Outside the body it may be cultivated in sugary or starchy liquids, and then produces round or oval cells, seldom filaments. When it grows in the mouth it gives 16â€”2

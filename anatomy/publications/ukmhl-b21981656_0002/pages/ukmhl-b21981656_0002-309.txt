289 CHAP. LIV.] THE INTESTINE IN DYSENTERY. The parts which undergo necrosis seldom cover any great extent of surface, and are often confined to the prominent ridges and folds of Fig. 177. Section thbough the colon fbom a case of dtsenteet.

In other cases the necrotic tissue takes the form of a flaky more or less adherent coating, or more rarely of broad continuous sloughs. The under- lying tissue is in all cases densely infiltrated with cells (d^). The infiltration may extend through the entire thickness of the submucosa (e), and may at length invade the muscular layers. The lymphadenoid follicles take part in the process, and frequently ulcerate. Occasionally the mucosa is undermined by suppuration beneath it, and in this way broad patches of the tissue are separated and cast off". When the mucosa is removed, open ulcers are of course left behind. These vary much in their depth and extent: sometimes over a great part of the bowel the mucous membrane remains only in narrow strips and islands. The affection may come to a stand-still at various stages of its course, and repair then begins. The slighter cases, in which but little substance is lost, are naturally the readiest to heal; but a certain amount of atrophy of the mucosa always remains. When the ulcerative process has gone further, atrophic cicatrices are left s. P. A. 19

GHAPTEK XXXIIT. TUBERCULOSIS OF SEEOUS MEMBRANES. 355. Tuberculosis attacks the serous membranes in three distinct ways. It may be a local manifestation of general miliary tuberculosis; or the tuberculous infection may be conveyed to the serous membrane from some contiguous focus of tubercle in one of the organs; or it may be primary, that is to say no other primary focus of infection may be discoverable. Three forms may be distinguished according to their anatomical characters. In the first the tubercles appear without inducing any general inflammation; this is chiefly the case in miliary tuber- culosis. In the second the eruption of tubercles is accompanied with extensive inflammatory changes and with effusion of liquid. In the third the inflammatory changes come to the front, the tubercles being everywhere as it were embedded in inflamed or new-formed inflammatory tissue. There are however no sharp lines to be drawn between the three forms, which often pass one into the other. 356. The eruption of grey tubercles in general miliary tuber- culosis, unaccompanied by diffiased inflammation, is most commonly observed in the pleura and peritoneum; it is rare in the pericardium. The grey nodules consist of aggregations of small leucoc}i;es surrounding the small vessels (Art. 123). The epithelial cells may long remain unchanged, but they are ultimately shed and disappear. Eruptions of miliary tubercles accompanied by moderate in- flammatory action are met with chiefly in cases where the serous membrane is infected from a contiguous focus of disease, such as a tuberculous lymphatic gland, a carious vertebra, a phthisical lung, or a tuberculous ulcer of the intestine. Cases occur in which no such starting-point can be made out, and in these we are obliged to consider that the affection is primary in the serous membrane: the peritoneum is by far the commonest seat.

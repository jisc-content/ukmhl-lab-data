Intravascdlar development of new pibbous tissue in the liver. Pibroblasts and small leucocytes are seen lying within the capUlaries among the liver-cells (Fig. 189 c) and presently compressing or dis- placing them, A certain number of the liver-cells consequently become atrophied and perish. In some cases this atrophy by com- pression is very considerable, in other cases the cells persist in a remarkable way. As a result of the destruction of liver-cells, which perish by fatty degeneration as well as by simple atrophy, deposits of yellow and brown pigment appear in the aflfected tissue. Part of this is de- rived from the colouring-matter of the blood, in consequence of the interference with the secretion of bile; part is probably derived from bile actually secreted, but retained in consequence of the blocking of the bile-channels. The new-formed fibrous tissue is frequently infiltrated with bile-pigment. The bile-ducts are seldom greatly obstructed, or diminished either in size or number. Indeed in some forms of hepatitis they appear to be multiplied. 497. When indurative hepatitis has lasted for some weeks or months the connective tissues of the liver always exhibit a more or less marked hyperplasia. This is chiefly shown in the fibrous portal sheaths (Fig. 191 6) which appear broadened and thickened. In some cases the fibrous overgrowth is almost entirely confined to the interlobular struc- tures ; but it often extends to the lobules, creeping along the lobular capillaries and intruding itself between the columns of liver-cells

STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. 176 vessels are exposed to the action of the air. The blood, circulating in steady streams through this capillary plexus, returns through the pulmonary veins. These, at first extremely minute, gradually coalesce into larger and larger branches which anastomose very freely, and accompany the arteries. They finally emerge from the root of the lung by two large trunks which carry the oxygenated blood to the left auricle of the heart. The pulmonary veins are not provided with valves. Bronchial These are small arteries, two or more in number Arteries. for each lung. The right arises either from the first aortic intercostal, or, conjointly with the left bronchial, from the thoracic aorta. The left comes from the thoracic aorta. They enter the lung behind the divisions of the bronchi, which they accompany. They are the proper nutritive vessels of the organ. The bronchial vessels are distributed in various ways : some of their branches supply the coats of the air-passages, the large blood- vessels and the lymphatic glands ; others the interlobular tissue : a few reach the surface of the lung, and ramify beneath the pleura. The right bronchial veins terminate in the vena azygos ; the left, in the superior intercostal vein. The nerues of the lung are derived from the pneumogastric and the sympathetic. They enter with the bronchial tubes, forming a plexus in front and behind them, anterior and posterior pulmo- nary plexus, in which are found minute ganglia. The lymphatics of the lungs commence in the lymphatic capillaries in the interlobular tissue, and thence pass to the surface forming a network which communicates with the subpleural lymphatic plexus: others take their origin in the mucous mem- brane of the bronchial tubes, and all eventually enter the bronchial glands. Of these, the larger are situated about the bronchi near the root of the lung, particularly under the bifurcation of the trachea.

The conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis. 4. The fascia transversalis. 5. The subperitoneal fat and the peritoneum. In almost all cases, the immediate investment of the intestine is the parietal layer of the peritoneum. This constitutes the sac of the hernia. The opening of the sac, communicating with the abdomen, is called its mouth; then comes the narrow, con- Fig. > 74.

Under these conditions, when a protrusion takes place, the intestine does not push forwards a sac derived from the parietal layer of the peritoneum, but it lies in a * In our experience the weakness of the conjoined tendon is, anatomically speak- ing, the determining cause of this form of hernia.

But this is not always the case. It sometimes happens that the peritoneal pouch comes down nearer to the prostate than usualâ€”we have seen it in actual contact with the gland; so that, in such a case, it would be impossible to tap the bladder from the rectum without going through the peri- toneum. In children the peritoneum comes down lower than it does in the adult, because the bladder in the child is not a pelvic viscus. Fig. 87. Symphysis pubis Corpus cavernosum penis Glans penis . . .

The bladder soon fills the pelvis, and then, rising into the abdomen, occasions the pouch between it and the abdominal wall. At first, the pouch is shallow, but it gradually deepens as the bladder * See a paper in the ' Med. Chir. Trans,' vol.. xxxv. by Mr. Cock.

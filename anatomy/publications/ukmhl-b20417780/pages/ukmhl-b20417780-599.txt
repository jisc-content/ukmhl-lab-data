DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 585 below the pons, bundles of nerves are seen decussating across the anterior fissure (fig. 140). This is the explanation of C7*oss paralysisâ€”i.e. when one side of the brain is injured, the loss of motion is manifested on the opposite side of the body.* This decussation, which consists of three or four bundles on each side, involves only the inner fibres of the pyramid; the outer fibres ascend through the pons without crossing. The decussating fibres are the continuations upwards of the deep fibres of the Fig. 141. DIAGRAM OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE AND RESTIFORM BODIES. 1. Thalamus opticus. 4.

The olivary bodies are the two oval eminences situated on the outer side of the anterior pyramids, from which they are separated by a shallow depression. They do not ascend quite as high as the pons. They consist externally of white matter; and, when cut * The phenomenon of cross paralysis of sensation is explained by the fact made out by Brown-Sequard, that the paths of sensory impressions cross each other in the grey matter of the cord.

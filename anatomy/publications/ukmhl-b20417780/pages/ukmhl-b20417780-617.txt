DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 603 the middle of the hemisphere, is separated from its fellow by the septum lucidum. Its roof is formed by the corpus callosum. On the floor, beginning from the front, are seen, the corpus striatum, the taenia semicircularis, the optic thalamus, the choroid plexus, and the fornix. The anterior horn extends into the frontal lobe, and as it passes forwards it diverges slightly from its fellow of the opposite side. Its roof is formed by the corpus callosum, and it curves round the anterior extremity of the corpus striatum. The posterior horn may be traced into the occipital lobe, where it passes at first backwards and outwards, and then converges towards its fellow. In it are to be noticed an elevation Fig. 149. TRANSVERSE VERTICAL SECTION THROUGH THE BRAIN. of white substance, the hippocampus minor, also a triangular flat surface external to it, called the pes accessorius or eminentia collateralis* The middle horn runs into the middle lobe, descends towards the base of the brain, making a curve, at first backwards and outwards, then downwards and forwards, and lastly inwards : the * The posterior horns are not always equally developed in both hemispheres, and sometimes they are absent in one or both. In the carnivora, ruminantia, 6olipeda, pachydermata, and rodentia, the lateral ventricles are prolonged into the largely developed olfactory lobes. This is the case in the hum in fetus only at an early period.

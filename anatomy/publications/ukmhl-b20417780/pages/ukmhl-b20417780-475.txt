DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PERINEUM. 461 vagina like a thick cord. The urethra is slightly curved with the concavity upwards ; but for all practical purposes it may be con- sidered straight. Its direction, however, is not horizontal. In the unimpregnated state it runs nearly in the direction of the axis of the outlet of the pelvis; so that a probe pushed on in the course of the urethra would strike against the promontory of the sacrum. But, after impregnation, when the uterus begins to rise out of the pelvis, the bladder is more or less raised also in con- sequence of their mutual connection ; therefore the urethra, in the latter months of utero-gestation, acquires a much more per- pendicular course. The female urethra is provided with a compressor muscle, similar, in origin and arrangement, to that which surrounds the Fig. 104. 1. Meatus urinarius. 2. Vagina. 3. Bulb of vagina. 4.

The prostate gland is wanting, but there are minute glands scattered around the neck of the bladder. In consequence of the wider span of the pubic arch, and the more yielding nature of the surrounding structures, the female urethra is much more dilatable than the male. By means of a sponge tent, it may be safely dilated to admit the easy passage of the fore-finger into the bladder. Ad- vantage is taken of this great dilatability in the extraction of calculi from the bladder. The mucous coat of the urethra is arranged in longitudinal folds, and is lined by squamous epithelium, which changes to the spheroidal variety near the bladder. Next to the mucous coat is * Taken from an injected preparation in the Muede Orfila, at Paris.

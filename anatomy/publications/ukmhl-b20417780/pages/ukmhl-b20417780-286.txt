The lesser internal cutaneous {nerve of Wrisberg) perforates the fascia about the lower third of the arm, and supplies the skin over the internal condyle and the olecranon.

DISTRIBUTION OF CUTANEOUS NERVES TO THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDER AND ARM. axillary vein, communicates with the first or second intercosto-humeral nerve.

ANATOMY OF PARTS CONCERNED IN HERNIA. 3G9 is called an incomplete inguinal hernia ; if, however, the pro- trusion has emerged through the external ring, it is called a com- plete inguinal hernia ; and, lastly, if it descends into the scrotum, it is called a scrotal hernia.

Sometimes it protrudes internal to the deep epigastric artery through a triangular weak place, bounded on the inner side by the rectus, on the outer side by the deep epigastric artery, and below by Poupart's ligament. This space* is relatively weak, having in front of it only the fascia transversalis and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis ; moreover, it is situated immediately behind the ex- ternal abdominal ring. A portion of intestine protruding through this triangle comes directly forwards through the external ring, and the hernia is then called a direct inguinal hernia.

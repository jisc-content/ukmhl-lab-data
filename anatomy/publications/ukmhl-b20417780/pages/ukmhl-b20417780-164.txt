150 INTERCOSTAL NERVES. Fig. 27. azygos major ; on the left, the seven or eight lower terminate in the vena azygos minor, the remainder in the left superior intercostal vein. The usual relation which the intercostal vessels and nerve bear to each other in the intercostal space,, is, that the vein lies uppermost, the nerve lowest, and the artery "between them. Intercostal These are twelve in number, and are the anterior Nerves. divisions of the dorsal spinal nerves. Each dorsal nerve (like all the spinal nerves) arises from the spinal cord by two roots, an anterior or motor,, and a posterior or sensory. The sen- sory root has a ganglion upon it. The- two roots unite in the intervertebral foramen and form a compound nerve. After passing through the foramen, it is connec- ted by two filaments with the sym- pathetic nerve, and then divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branches pass back- wards between the transverse pro- cesses of the dorsal vertebrae, and supply the muscles of the back. The anterior branches (the proper intercostal nerves) proceed between the intercostal muscles in company with, and immediately below, their corresponding arteries. In the an- terior part of the intercostal space the nerves lie in the substance of the internal intercostal muscles, and at the costal cartilages run through the muscles, passing in front of the triangularis sterni and the internal mammary artery. Midway between the spine and the sternum, they give off lateral cutaneous branches, which supply the skin over the scapula and the thorax. The intercostal nerves terminate in front in the anterior cutaneous nerves; the six upper, coming through their respective intercostal spaces, supply the skin over the chest; the six lower terminate in the front wall of the abdomen, near the linea alba. Notice that the first dorsal nerve ascends nearly perpen- DIAGRAM OF A SPINAL NERVE.

TAKSO-METATARSAL JOINTS. 576 The remaining bones of the tarsus are connected and main- tained in position by dorsal and plantar ligaments, and strong interosseous hands which pass between their contiguous surfaces. Though there is very little motion between any two bones, the collective amount is such that the foot is enabled to adapt itself accur- ately to the ground ; pressure is more equally distributed, and consequently there is a firmer basis for the support of the body. Being com- posed, moreover, of several pieces, each of which possesses a certain Fig. 138. Interosseous ligaments of the wedge bones.

Tarso-meta- The tarsus articulates with the metatarsus in tarsal joints. an oblique line which inclines backwards on its outer side. This line is interrupted at the joint of the middle cuneiform bone and the second metatarsal bone. Here there is a deep recess, so that the base of this metatarsal bone is wedged in between the internal and external cuneiform bones.

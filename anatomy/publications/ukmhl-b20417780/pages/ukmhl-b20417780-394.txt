380 PERITONEUM. From the diaphragm two layers of peritoneum proceed to the liver, forming its lateral ligaments; they separate to inclose the liver, meet again on its under aspect, and pass on, under the name of the gastro-hepatic omentum, to the small curve of the stomach. Separating here, they embrace the stomach, and, meeting again at Fig. 77. ^s greater curve, pass down like a curtain over the small intestine to form the great omentum. At the lower margin of the great omentum, they are reflected up- wards (so that the great omentum consists of four layers) to the front of the transverse colon, which they inclose, and, after joining again at the back of the colon, proceed to the spine, forming the transverse meso-colon. At this situation the two layers diverge, the upper one ascends in front of the pancreas, and the crura of the diaphragm to its under surface, at which point we started.* The lower layer is reflected from the spine over the small in- testine, back again to the spine, to form the mesentery. From the root of the mesentery it descends into the pelvis, and invests the upper two-thirds of the rectum. From the rectum, in the male, it is re- diagram of the peritoneum. fleeted to the posterior part of the * In foetal life, the ascending layers of the great omentum may be traced back to the spine near the pancreas; and here the layers diverge from each other. The upper layer ascends in front of the pancreas to the diaphragm ; the lower layer proceeds over the arch of the colon, and then back to the spine, thus forming the transverse meso- colon. Its reflections afterwards are the same as in the adult. As the foetus grows, the great omentum becomes adherent to the arch of the colon.

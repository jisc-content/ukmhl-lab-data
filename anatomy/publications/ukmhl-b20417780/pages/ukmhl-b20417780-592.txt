578 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Membranes of Pkevious to the examination of the brain itself, the Brain. we should study the structure and uses of the three membranes by which it is surrounded. The first, the dura mater, has been described (p. 6). The second is a serous membrane, termed the arachnoid ; the third is a vascular one, termed the pia mater. Arachnoid This second investment forms the smooth, Membrane. polished surface of the brain, exposed after the removal of the dura mater. Tt is named arachnoid, from the resemblance of its texture to a spider's web. It is a serous mem- brane, and, like all others of the kind, forms a closed sac, one part of which, the parietal layer, lines the under surface of the dura mater; the other, the visceral, is reflected over the brain. The opposed surfaces of this membrane are polished, and lubricated by a serous fluid which diminishes friction ; since the brain is moved with a slight pulsation, caused in part by the action of the heart, in part by respiration. The parietal layer is so thin that it can be demonstrated as a distinct layer only in a few places; it consists of little more than a layer of squamous epithelium, lining the inner aspect of the dura mater. The visceral layer is colourless and transparent; it is spread uniformly over the surface of the brain, and does not dip into the furrows between the convolutions. On account of its extreme tenuity, and its close adhesion to the pia mater, it cannot be readily separated from this membrane; but there are places, especially at the base of the brain, termed subarachnoid spaces, where the arachnoid membrane can be seen distinct from the subjacent pia mater.

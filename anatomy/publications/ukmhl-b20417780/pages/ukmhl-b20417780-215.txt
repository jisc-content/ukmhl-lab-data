The size of the larynx does not necessarily follow the propor- tions of the general stature; it may be as large in a little person as in a tall one: this corresponds with what we know of the voice.

Both proceed from the cornu of the thyroid cartilage ; the one upwards and backwards, the other downwards and forwards to the cricoid. Remember that the only kind of motion permitted is vertical: and that this motion regulates the tension of the vocal cords. DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. The tongue- is a complex muscular organ, subservient to taste, speech, suction, mastication, and deglutition. Its upper surface is convex and free, as is also its anterior part or tip which lies behind the lower incisor teeth; its posterior and inferior part is connected to the os hyoides by the hyo-glossi, to the styloid process of the temporal bone by the stylo-glossi, and to the symphysis of the lower jaw by the genio-hyo-glossi muscles. Its upper surface, or dorsum, is convex, and slopes on all sides from the centre : running along the middle is a median groove— raphe—which terminates posteriorly in a depression, the foramen ccecum, into which open several mucous glands. The surface of the tongue is covered with mucous membrane, which is composed of structures similar to those of the skin generally: that is to say, it consists of a 6 cutis vera,' w7ith nume- rous elevations called papilla?, and of a thick layer of squamous

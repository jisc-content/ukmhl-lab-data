119 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. vertebra, laterally by the first ribs, and in front by the upper border of the manubrium sterni. The aperture gives passage to the trachea, the oesophagus, the large vessels of the head and neck aud upper extremities, viz., the innominate, the left carotid and subclavian arteries^, with the left innominate and right subclavian and internal jugular veins, the superior intercostal and internal mammary arteries,, the middle thyroid veins, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid and lougus colli muscles, the pneumogastric, the left recurrent laryngeal, the phrenic and the sympathetic nerves; the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric ; also to the first dorsal nerve as it passes up to join the brachial plexus, the thoracic duct, the thymus gland (in early life), and lastly to the apices of the lungs, which, with their pleural coverings, rise up on each side into the neck for about one inch and a half above the first rib ; the interspaces between these various structures being occupied by a dense fibro-cellular tissue. The base of the thorax, formed by the diaphragm, descends in front (in the dead subject) on the right side as low as the upper border of the fifth rib ; on the left as low as the upper border of the sixth rib.* The chest of the female differs from that of the male in the following points:—Its general capacity is less : the sternum is shorter; the upper opening is larger in proportion to the lower; the upper ribs are more moveable, and therefore permit a greater * That the student may hare some knowledge of the diameters of the chest at dif- ferent situations, the following measurements have been taken from a well-articulated male skeleton of the average height:—The antero-posterior diameter at the upper opening of the thorax is 2^ inches, at the articulation of the manubrium with the gladiolus it is 4^ inches, and at the junction of the gladiolus with the ensiform carti- lage it has increased to 5| incites. The transverse diameter of the upper opening was found to be 4| inches; between the second ribs, 7 inches; between the third, 8^ inches; the diameter increases in regular proportion as far as the ninth rib, where it attains a measurement of I Of inches; below this it gradually decreases. The articula- tion of the manubrium and the gladiolus is on a level with the fourth dorsal vertebra ; the junction of the ensiform cartilage with the gladiolus is on a level with the border of the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra; and, lastly, the upper border of the manubrium corresponds to the second dorsal vertebra.

253 ARTICULATION OF THE LOWER JAW. the joint: the articulation of one side performs the office of inter- nal lateral ligament to the other. The inter-articular ftbro-cartilage is a thin plate of an oval form, and thicker at the margin than at the centre. It is connected on the outer side to the external lateral ligament, and on the inner side some of the fibres of the external pterygoid muscle are in- serted into it. TRANSVERSE SECTION TO SHOW THE LIGAMENTS AND THE 'FIBRO-C ARTILAGE OF THE JOINT OF THE LOWER JAW. THE DOTTED LINES REPRESENT THE TWO SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. There are two synovial membranesan upper and a lower, for the joint. The larger and looser of the two is situated between the glenoid cavity and the fibro-cartilage. The lower is interposed between the fibro-cartilage and the condyle of the jaw. They sometimes communicate through a small aperture in the centre of the fibro-cartilage. The form of the articulation of the lower jaw admits of move- ment, upwards and downwards, forwards, backwards, and from side Fig. 51. Inter articular fibro-cartilage .

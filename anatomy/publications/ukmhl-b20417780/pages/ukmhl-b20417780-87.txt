DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 7:5 nerve; it then descends behind the plexus and the subclavian vessels to the outer surface of the serratus magnus, to the several digitations of which it is exclusively distributed. g. An articular branch is distributed to the shoulder joint; besides some filaments to the constituent bones. It only remains to be observed that the upper cord of the brachial plexus receives a branch from the lower cord of the cer- vical, and that each of its component nerves communicates by slender filaments with the sympathetic. Below the clavicle the plexus divides into branches for the supply of the arm; namely, the anterior thoracic nerves (two in number, to the pectoralis major and minor), the subscapular (three in number, to the subscapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and teres major), the circumflex (to the deltoid and teres minor), the median, the musculo-spiral, the ulnar, the external cutaneous, the internal cutaneous, and the lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg) : all of which will be described more fully in the dissec- tion of the arm. DISSECTION OF THE FACE. Much practice is required to make a good dissection of the face. The muscles of expression are numerous and complicated ; they are interwoven with the subcutaneous tissue and closely united to the skin : their fibres are often pale and indistinct. The face is largely supplied with motor and sensory nerves, of which the ramifications extend far and wide. Therefore you must not be discouraged if, in a first attempt, you fail to make a satisfactory display of the parts. The cheeks and nostrils should be distended with horse-hair, and the lips sewn together. Make an incision down the mesial line of the face ; another from the chin along the base of the lower jaw to the angle ; then prolong it, in front of the ear, to the zygoma. Eeflect the skin from below upwards. Each muscle, to be properly cleaned, should be stretched by hooks.

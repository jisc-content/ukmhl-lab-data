It is distributed to the skin of the auricle and communicates with the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. Facial Nerve ^ne facial nerve is contained within the meatus en the auditorius interims, together with the auditory Temporal Bone. nerve. At the bottom of the meatus the two nerves are connected by one or more filaments. The facial nerve then enters the aquseductus Fallopii. This is a tortuous canal in the substance of the temporal bone,, and terminates at the Fig. 46.. 5.

The nerve proceeds from the meatus in- terims for a short distance outwards, where it presents a ganglionic enlargement; it then makes a sudden bend backwards along the inner wall of the tympanum above the fenestra ovalis, and lastly, curving downwards along the back of the tympanum, it leaves the skull through the stylo-mastoid foramen. Its branches in the temporal bone are :â€” a. Communicating filaments with the auditory nerve, in the meatus auditorius internus. b.

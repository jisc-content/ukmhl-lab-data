SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 218 DISSECTION OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. To trace this nerve and its branches we must remove the outer wall of the orbit as far as the foramen rotundum, so as to expose the spheno-maxillary fossa. The superior maxillary nerve is the second division of the fifth cranial nerve. Proceeding from the Grasserian ganglion (fig. 43), Fig. 43. DIAGRAM OF THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 1. Sphenopalatine ganglion. 2. Otic ganglion. it leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum, and passes hori- zontally forwards across the spheno-maxillary fossa. It then passes into the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, enters the infra-orbital canal with the corresponding artery, and finally emerges upon the face, through the infra-orbital foramen, beneath the levator labii superioris. The branches given off are :â€” a. The orbital branch already described (p. 217). b. Two branches, which descend to the spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel's), situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa (p. 220).

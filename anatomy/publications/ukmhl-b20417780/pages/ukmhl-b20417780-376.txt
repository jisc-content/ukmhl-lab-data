ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. 362 Fig. 72. Rectus This long muscle is situated vertically iu front Abdominis. 0f ^e abdomen, and is enclosed in a sheath formed by the aponeuroses of the lateral muscles of the abdomen. To expose it, therefore, slit up the middle of the sheath, and reflect the two halves. It arises by two tendons^ the inner and smaller of which is attached to the symphysis, the outer to the crest of the pubes. As the fibres pass up, the muscle becomes broader and thinner, and is inserted into the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. Notice the tendinous intersections across the muscle called linece transversa which are incomplete repetitions of the ribs in the wall of t.hft aManiemf Their number varies from three to five, but there are always more above than below the umbilicus. These tendinous intersections adhere closely to the sheath in front, but not behind; consequently, pus formed between the front of the rectus and its sheath would be con- fined by two intersec- tions ; not so on the back of the muscle, where pus might travel down the entire length of it. The sheath of the rectus consists in front of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, THE RECTUS, THE QUADRATUS LUMBORUM AND THE and half the thickneSS erector spin*:. of that of the internal oblique; while the back of the sheath comprises the aponeurosis of the transversalis, and half that of the internal oblique (fig. 71). This, however, applies only to the upper three-fourths of the muscle; the lower fourth has no sheath behind, since all the aponeuroses pass in front of it. * Some animals—e.g. the crocodile—have bony abdominal ribs.

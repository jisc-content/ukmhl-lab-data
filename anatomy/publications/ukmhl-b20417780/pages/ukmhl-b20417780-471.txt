457 PENIS. between the two corpora cavernosa; it is only complete near the root of the penis ; along the rest of the organ there are vertical slits in it, giving it the appearance of a comb: hence its name. Through the intervals in this partition the blood-vessels of the two corpora cavernosa communicate freely with each other. From the interior of the fibrous coat a number of delicate septa, trabeculce, pass inwards into the corpus cavernosum, inter- secting each other in all directions, and forming a multitude of small spaces. The trabecular consist of fibrous lamellar, with elastic and some non-striated muscular tissue. The spaces com- municate freely with each other, as may be readily ascertained by blowing air into the penis; they are smaller and their component septa thicker at the circumference than in the centre of the corpora Fig. 103. 1.

Each corpus cavernosum thus consists of innumerable spaces mainly occupied by dilated venous sinuses, from which the blood is conveyed by the dorsal vein, the prostatic plexus, and the pudendal veins. When the penis is flaccid, these spaces are empty ; when it is erect, they are distended with blood. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa come from the branches of the pudic (p. 427), which enter the inner side of each crus, and proceed forwards near the septum, distributing numerous ramifications. These are supported in the middle of the fibrous septa, and end, some in capillaries which convey their blood at once into the inter-trabecular spaces, others in tendril-like prolongations with dilated extremities which project into the

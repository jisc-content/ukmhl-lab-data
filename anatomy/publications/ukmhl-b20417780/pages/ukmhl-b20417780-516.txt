SAPHENOUS OPENING. 502 Some anatomists describe this fascia as a portion of the superficial fascia ; others consider it as a thin prolongation of the fascia lata itself across the opening. Its chief surgical importance is de- rived from the fact that it forms one of the coverings of a femoral hernia. The cribriform fascia must now be removed so as to display the saphenous opening, which will appear as represented in fig. 116. Eeverting to the saphenous opening, we observe that it is situated just below the crural arch, not far from the pubes ; that it is oval with the long axis vertical, and about one inch and a half Fig. 116. 1.

Its border on the inner side is not de- fined ; for here the fascia lata ascends under the femoral vessels, and is continuous with the iliac fascia of the pelvis.* But the outer or iliac border is clearly defined. This lies in front of the femoral vessels, is crescent-shaped, with the concavity towards the pubes, and called the falciform process of Bums. The lower horn of the crescent curves under the saphena vein with a well- defined border, and on being traced upwards becomes less well * On the inner side of the femoral vessels the pubic portion of the fascia is at- tached to the linea ilio-pectinea.

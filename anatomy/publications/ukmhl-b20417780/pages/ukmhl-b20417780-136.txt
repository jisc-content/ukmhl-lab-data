122 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. trunk at the upper part of the chest, which terminates in the brachio-cephalic vein of its own side. Lymphatic There are several lymphatic glands in the Glands. neighbourhood of the internal mammary artery. They receive the lymphatics from the inner portion of the mam- mary gland, from the diaphragm, and the upper part of the abdo- minal wall. In disease of the inner portion of the mamma, these glands may enlarge without any enlargement of those in the axilla. If a transverse section were made through the chest {see fig. 20), you would observe that as the pleurae nowhere come into actual contact, a space is left between them extending from the sternum to the spine, and which is larger in the middle than in front or behind. This interval is called by anatomists the interpleural space, and for convenience sake is subdivided into an (ulterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. Mediastina ^ne mediastina are the spaces which the two anterior, middle pleural sacs leave between them in the antero- and posterior. posterior plane of the chest. There is an anterior, a middle, and a posterior mediastinum. To put these spaces in the simplest light, let us imagine the heart and lungs to be re- moved from the chest, and the two pleural sacs to be left in it by themselves. The two sacs, if inflated, would then appear like two Fig. 19. bladders, in contact only in the middle, as shown by the dotted outlines in the annexed' scheme (fig. 19). The interval marked a, behind the sternum, would repre- se t the anterior mediastinum ; the interval 6, the posterior medi- astinum. Now let us introduce the heart again, between the two pleural sacs : these must give way to make room for it, so that the two sacs are largely separated in the middle line of the chest; and the space thus

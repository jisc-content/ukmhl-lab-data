SAPHENOUS OPENING. 501 above, its attachment can be traced from the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx, along the crest of the ilium, thence along the crural arch to the body of the pubes, and down the rami of the pubes and ischium. Proceeding down the thigh, it penetrates, on either side of the limb, to the linea aspera, forming what are called the external and internal intermuscular septa, which separate the extensor from the flexor muscles. Below, it can be traced round the knee-joint, and is particularly strong, especially on the outer side, where it is attached to the head of the tibia and fibula, and forms the inser- tion of the tensor fasciae femoris. There are numerous small apertures in the . fascia, through which the cutaneous nerves and vessels are transmitted ; but the most important one is the large opening—the saphenous opening —through which the saphena vein passes to join the femoral. That part of the fascia lata situated external to the saphenous opening is termed the iliac portion of the fascia lata; that internal to it, the pubic portion. Saphenous The saphenous opening is an Opening in the oval aperture in the fascia lata, Fascia Lata. immediately below the crural arch, on the inner side of the front of the thigh, through which the saphena vein passes to join the femoral. There is no definite border to the saphenous opening until the fascia, which covers the opening and blends with its margin, has been removed. The term cribriform has been given to this fascia, because it is perforated with holes for the passage of the superficial vessels and lymphatics. It is a thin covering over the saphenous opening, and is prolonged from the outer edge of the opening over the sheath Cribriform of the femoral vessels, and adheres on the inner Fascia, side to the fascia lata, over the pectineus muscle, FASCIA ON THE OUT- SIDE OF THE THIGH. 1.

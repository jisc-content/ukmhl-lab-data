The anterior ends, below the pons Varolii, in a cul-de-sac, termed the foramen cwcum, and is occupied by a process of pia mater. The posterior runs along the floor of the fourth ventricle as a shallow median groove. The surface of 'the medulla is marked out on each side into four longitudinal columns, which receive the following names Fig. 140.

The anterior pyramids are two columns of white matter, narrow below, but increasing gradually in breadth as they ascend towards the pons. At this part they become constricted, and may be traced through the pons into the crura cerebri. The fibres of which they are in the main composed are derived from the anterior columns of the spinal cord, and consist there- fore of motor fibres. On separating the pyramids about an inch

DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 590 The fissure of Sylvius is seen on the base of the cerebrum, and receives the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It curves outwards as a deep cleft, and divides into two rami; an as- cending or vertical, about an inch in lengtn, and a posterior or horizontal ramus, which passes backwards, and ends about the middle of the hemisphere. ¥m. 143, VIEW OF THE CONVOLUTIONS AND FISSURES OF THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE ■BRAIN (LEFT SIDE). a.

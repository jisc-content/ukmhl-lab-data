114 SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK. trunk, and is finally incorporated with the nerve below the ganglion. The spinal part separates from the accessory part below the foramen jugulare. It then takes a curved course backwards and outwards, lying in front of the transverse process of the atlas, and, after supplying the sterno-mastoid muscle, is distributed to the trapezius. Hypoglossal This nerve passes through the anterior condy- Nebvr. loid foramen in two fasciculi which join outside the skull. The nerve comes forward between the internal jugu- lar vein and the internal carotid artery, and then winds round the occipital artery. Its further course has been described (p. 49). At the base of the skull it gives off several filaments which connect it with the ganglion of the trunk of the pneumogastric nerve. These two nerves are sometimes almost inseparably united. It gives off also several delicate filaments to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and communicates with the loop formed by the first two spinal nerves in front of the atlas. Sympathetic Now examine the cervical ganglia of the sym- Nekye. pathetic system of nerves. This 'system' consists of a series of ganglia arranged on each side of the spine, from the first cervical to the last sacral vertebra. The successive ganglia of the same side are connected by intermediate nerves, so as to form a continuous cord on each side of the spine : this constitutes what is called the trunk of the sympathetic system, and is connected with all the spinal nerves. Its upper or cephalic extremity enters the cranium through the carotid canal, surrounds the internal carotid artery, communicates with the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves, and joins its fellow of the.opposite side upon the anterior communicating artery.* Its sacral extremity joins its fellow by means of a little ganglion impar, situated in the mesial line, upon the coccyx. * Here is situated the so-called ganglion of Ribes.

17 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. on the carotid artery, as it lies by the side of the body of the sphenoid. This is the carotid plexus. It is connected by numerous filaments with the sixth nerve and the Gasserian ganglion. Those filaments of the sympathetic seen on the artery in the upper part of the cavernous sinus, constitute the cavebnous plexus, which is in communication with the third, the fourth, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerves. THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Make a vertical incision through the skin, down the middle of the neck from the symphysis of the lower jaw to the sternum; a second along the clavicle to the acromion ; a third along the base of the jaw as far as the mastoid process. Eeflect the skin, and expose the cutaneous muscle called the platysma myoides. Between the platysma and the skin is a layer of adipose tissue, called the superficial fascia. It varies in thickness in different subjects, but is generally more abundant at the upper part of the neck, especially in corpulent individuals, in whom it occasions a double chin. Platysma The platysma myoides is the thin cutaneous Myoides. muscle of the neck. It arises from the sub- cutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles;* thence proceeding obliquely over the clavicle and the side of the neck, its fibres become more closely aggregated, and terminate thus:â€”The anterior cross those of the opposite platysma, im- mediately below the symphysis of the jaw, and are lost in the skin of the chin; the middle are attached along the base of the jaw; the posterior cross the masseter muscle, and terminate, partly in the subcutaneous tissue of the cheek, partly in the muscles at the corner of the mouth.f * Some anatomists describe it as having a slender origin from the clavicle and the acromion. f Some of the uppermost fibres of this part of the platysma take the name of musculus risorius: this will be described among the muscles of the face.

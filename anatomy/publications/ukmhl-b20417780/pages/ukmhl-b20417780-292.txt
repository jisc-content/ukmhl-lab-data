BRACHIAL ARTERY. 278 Bbachialis This muscle is situated upon the lower half of Anticus. the humerus, and is partially concealed by the biceps. Between the two muscles is the musculo-cutaneous nerve, which supplies them both. It arises from the humerus by a fleshy digitation on either side of the tendon of the deltoid ; from the lower half of the front sur- face of the bone, and from the intermuscular septa. The muscle, becoming thicker and broader, covers the front of the capsule of the elbow-joint to which it is more or less attached, and terminates on a tendon, which is inserted in a pointed manner into the coro- noid process of the ulna. Its action is to bend the forearm. Its nerves come from the musculo-cutaneous. Sometimes the brachialis anticus receives in addition a small branch from the musculo- spiral. Now examine the course and relations of the brachial vessels and nerves. Course and Be- The^| brachial | artery—the continuation of the iations of the axillary—takes its name at the lower border of Brachial Artery, the teres major. It runs down the inner side of the arm, along the inner border of the coraco-brachialis and biceps, to about an inch below the elbow, where it divides, near the coronoid process of the ulna, into the radial and ulnar arteries. Thus its direction corresponds with a line drawn from the deepest part of the axilla to the middle point between the condyles of the humerus. In the upper part of its course it lies on the long and inner heads of the triceps (from the long head it is separated by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery) ; in the middle, it lies on the tendon of the coraco-brachialis ; in the lower part, on the brachialis anticus. The artery is accompanied by two veins (vence comites), and the median nerve, all of which are invested in a common sheath of fascia. The median nerve crosses obliquely in front of the artery, lying, near the axilla, on its outer side; near the elbow, on^ its inner.

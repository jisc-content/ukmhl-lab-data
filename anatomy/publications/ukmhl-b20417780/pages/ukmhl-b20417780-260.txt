LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 246 LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. The vertebrae are connected by their intervertebral fibre-carti- lages, by ligaments in front of and behind their bodies, and by ligaments which extend between their arches and their spines. Their articular processes have capsular ligaments, and synovial membranes. Anterior Com- This is a strong band of longitudinal fibres mon Ligament. which extends along the front of the bodies of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are not all of equal length. The more superficial extend from one vertebra to the fourth or fifth below it; those a little deeper pass from one vertebra to the second or third below it; while the deepest of all preceed from vertebra to vertebra. The ligament becomes broader and stronger in proportion to the size of the vertebrae. By making transverse incisions through it in different situations, we observe that its fibres are more firmly adherent to the intervertebral cartilages, and to the borders of the vertebrae, than to the middle of the bones. Posterior Com- This extends longitudinally, in a similar manner mon Ligament. to the anterior common ligament, along the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum, and sends up a prolongation to the anterior border of the foramen magnum continuous with the apparatus liga- mentosus. Interspinous These bands of ligamentous fibres fill up the Ligaments. intervals between the spines of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. They are the most marked in the lumbar region. Those fibres which connect the apices of the spines, being stronger than the rest, are described as separate ligaments under the name of supraspinous. Their use is to limit the flexion of the spine. Ligaments These are called, on account of their colour, between the ligamenta subflava.â€”To obtain a good view Arches of the 0f them, the arches of the vertebrae should be removed with a saw. They pass between the

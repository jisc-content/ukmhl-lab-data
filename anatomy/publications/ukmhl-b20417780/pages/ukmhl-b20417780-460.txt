446 BLADDER, PROSTATE, URETHRA, AND PENIS. The vesical filaments of the sympathetic do not stop at the prostate, but pass on beneath the pubic arch into the corpus caver- nosum penis. Thus the erectile tissue of the intromittent organ is brought directly within the influence of the sympathetic system.* STRUCTURE OF THE BLADDER, PROSTATE, URETHRA, AND PENIS. It is assumed that the parts have been collectively taken out of the pelvis, and that the partial peritoneal covering of the bladder has been removed. The bladder, in a fairly dilated condition, measures about five inches in length and three in breadth. Structure of The bladder is composed of a partial peri- the Bladder. toneal coat, a muscular, and a mucous; between the last two there is a layer of connective tissue, which the old anatomists called the cellular coat. The serous or peritoneal coat invests the posterior, lateral, and superior surfaces of the bladder; it is absent on the anterior and inferior aspect. The muscular coat is situated beneath the serous, and consists of unstriped or involuntary muscular fibres, which interlace with each other in all directions. Their general arrangement is as follows:—An outer, or longitudinal, layer arises from the upper half of the circumference of the prostate and the neck of the bladder, and thence its fibres spread out longitudinally over the summit of the bladder, pass round its posterior aspect and base, to be inserted into the prostate in the male, and the vagina in the female. This layer is especially marked on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the bladder. Under this is a thin layer of circular fibres, especially developed near the neck, where they form a sphincter—sphincter vesica?. Towards the sides of the bladder the two sets of fibres have a less definite arrangement, and form a kind of network: these, therefore, are the weakest * Miiller.

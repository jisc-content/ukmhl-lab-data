101 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. ceeds through a canal in the diploe to the symphysis, where it minutely inosculates with its fellow. In this canal, which runs beneath the roots of all the teeth, the artery gives branches which ascend through the little foramina in the fangs, and supply the pulp in their interior. Opposit3 the foramen mentale arises the mental branch already described (p. 94). Before entering the dental foramen the artery furnishes a small branch— mylo-hyoid—which accompanies the nerve proceeding to the mylo-hyoid muscle. Branches in e. The masseteric branch passes through the sigmoid the Second Part, notch of the jaw to the under surface of the masseter, with the masseteric nerve, and inosculates with the facial artery. Fig. 17. Third stage. Second stage. First stage. PLAN OF INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. f. The anterior and posterior temporal arteries ascend to supply the temporal muscle, ramifying between the muscle and the bone, one near the front, the other near the posterior border of the muscle. They com- municate with the superficial and middle temporal arteries, and with the terminal branches of the lachrymal a. g. The pterygoid branches supply the internal and external pterygoid muscles. h. The buccal branch runs forward with the buccal nerve to the buccinator, where it anastomoses with the facial artery.

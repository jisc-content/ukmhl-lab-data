338 STERNO-CLAVICULAR JOINT. the muscle is inserted (fig. 63). They terminate in small tendons, which pass between the metacarpal joints of the fingers, and are inserted, like those of the dorsal muscles, into the sides of the first phalanges and the extensor tendons on the back of the fingers. The first palmar interosseous muscle arises from the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the index finger. The second and third arise, the one from the radial side of the fourth, the other from the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and are inserted into the same sides of the ring and little fingers. The palmar interosseous muscles are all adductors to a line drawn through the middle finger (fig. 63). They are, therefore, the opponents of the dorsal interosseous, and move the fingers towards each other. The palmar and dorsal interossei are supplied by filaments from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. DISSECTION OF THE LIGAMENTS. Sterno-clati- The inner end of the clavicle articulates with cular joint. the comparatively small and shallow excavation on the upper and outer part of the sternum. The security of the joint depends upon the great strength of its ligaments. There are two synovial membranes, and an intervening fibro-cartilage. The anterior ster no-clavicular ligament (fig. 64) consists of a strong broad band of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely downwards and inwards over the front of the joint, from the inner end of the clavicle to the anterior surface of the sternum. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament extends over the back of the joint, from the back of the clavicle to the back of the sternum in a similar manner to the anterior. The inter-clavicular ligament connects the clavicles directly. It extends transversely above the notch of the sternum, and has a broad attachment to the upper border of each clavicle. Between

The ilio-hypogastric passes forwards to the crest of the ilium, where it pierces the transversalis, and divides into its two terminal branchesâ€”the iliac branch, which supplies the skin over the glutseal region, behind the last dorsal nerve, and the hypogastric branch, which runs forward between the transversalis and internal oblique, and then perforates the aponeu- Fig. 86.

The ilio-inguinal, the smaller, perforates the transversalis and internal oblique, comes out through the external abdominal ring in front of the spermatic cord, and supplies the skin of the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium in the female. b.

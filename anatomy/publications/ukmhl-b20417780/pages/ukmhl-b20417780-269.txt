255 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. D ss ctio ^HE arm ^em& placed at right angles with the trunk, and slightly rotated outwards, make three incisions through the skin : the first, along the middle of the sternum; the second, along the lower border of the clavicle and down the front of the upper arm for about four inches ; the third, from the ensiform cartilage, backwards, to the posterior border of the axilla. The skin should be carefully dissected from the subjacent layer of subcutaneous fascia and fat. In doing so notice the thin fibres of the broad subcutaneous muscle of the neck, Â£platysma myoicles^ (P. 17). Cutaneous The numerous nerves which run through the Nerves., subcutaneous tissue to the skin and mammary gland must be carefully dissected out. They are derived from various sources: some, branches of the superficial cervical plexus, descend over the clavicle; others, branches of the intercostal nerves, come through the intercostal spaces close to the sternum, each with a small artery ; a_third_series, also branches of the inter- costal nerves, come out on the side of the chest, and run forwards over the outer border of the pectoralis major. The supra-clavicular nerves, which descend over the clavicle, are subdivided, according to their direction, into sternal, cla- vicular', and acromial branches (diagram, p. 19). The sternal -cross the inner end of the clavicle to supply the skin over the upper part of the sternum. The clavicular pass over the middle of the clavicle, and supply the integument over the front of the chest and the mammary gland. The acromial branches cross over the outer end of the clavicle, and distribute their filaments to the skin of the shoulder.

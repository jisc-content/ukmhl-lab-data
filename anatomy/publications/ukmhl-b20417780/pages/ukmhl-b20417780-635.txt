621 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. Spinal Cord.

It is the continuation of the medulla oblongata, and extends from the fora- men magnum down to the upper border of the second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a conical point, conus medullar is, after having given off the large bundle of nerves termed cauda Cauda Equina. equina, for the supply DIAGRAM OF THE LIGAMENTUM DENTICULATUM. 1.

From the conus medullaris there is continued downwards a slender cord, the filum terminale, which passes within the sheath to the coccyx.f The length of the cord is from fifteen to eighteen inches, and its general form is cylindrical, slightly flattened in front and behind. It is not of uniform dimensions throughout. It presents a considerable enlargement in the lower part of the cervical region ; another in the lower part of the dorsal, from which proceed the large nerves to the upper and lower limbs, respectively. The upper or cervical enlargement, which is the larger, extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra; the lower, or lumbar, is situated opposite to the last dorsal vertebra. J The cord is divided into two symmetrical halves Fissures by a median longitudinal fissure in front and behind (fig. 157). The anterior fissure is the more distinct, and * Vide Axel, Key, and Ketzius; Max Schultze's 'Archives,' 1873. t The explanation of this is, that, at an early period of foetal life, the length of the cord corresponds with that of the vertebral canal; but after the third month, the lumbar and sacral vertebrae grow away from the cord, in accordance with the more active development of the lower limbs. See Tiedemann, ' Anatomie und Bildungs- geschichte des Gehirns im Foetus des Menschen,' &c; Nuremberg, 1816. X In very early fcetal life these enlargements do not exist, and only make their appearance with the development of the extremities.

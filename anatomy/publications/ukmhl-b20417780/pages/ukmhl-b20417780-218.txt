204 DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. elaborate structure escapes observation because it is buried beneath the epithelium.* Each secondary papilla receives a blood-vessel, which passes nearly to its apex, and returns in a loop-like manner. The papillae are covered with one or more layers of squamous epithelium. That which covers the filiform is superimposed so thickly as to give it sometimes the appearance of a brush when seen under the microscope. The various kinds of fur on the tongue consist of thick and sodden epithelium, Eespecting the use of the papillae, it is probable that they enable the tongue to detect impressions with greater delicacy. From the density and arrangement of their epithelial coat, the filiform papillae give the surface of the tongue a roughness, which is useful in its action upon the food. An apparatus of this kind, proportionately stronger and more developed, makes the tongue of ruminant animals an instrument by which they lay hold of their food. In the feline tribe—e.g. the lion and tiger—these papillae are so sharp and strong that they act like rasps, and enable the animal to lick the periosteum from the bones by a single stroke of his tongue. In some mammalia,, they act like combs for cleaning the skin and the hair. Numerous small racemose glands are found in the submucous tissue at the root of the tongue. They are similar in structure and secretion to the tonsillar and palatine glands, so that there is a complete ring of glands round the isthmus faucium. Small round orifices upon their surface indicate the termination of their ducts. Other mucous glands, with ducts from one quarter to half an inch long, are situated in the muscular substance of the tongue.

Considering each group as one gland, observe that it is oblong, with the long diameter from seven to ten lines, parallel with the axis of the tongue. It lies near the mesial line, a little below the ranine artery, on the outer side of the branches of the gustatory nerve, under some of the * See Bowman and Todd's 'Physiological Anatomy.'

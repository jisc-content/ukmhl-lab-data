LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. 573 malleolus on this side (fig. 134). The great strength of it is proved by the fact that, in dislocations of the ankle inwards, the summit of the malleolus is more often broken off than the ligament torn. It extends from a deep excavation at the apex of the malleolus, radiates from this point, and is attached to the side of the astragalus, also to the os calcis, to the scaphoid bone, and to the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which it firmly braces up (fig. 134).

595 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. There are nine pairs. Some are nerves of special sense—as the olfactory, the optic, the auditory; others are nerves of common sensation—as the larger root of the fifth, the glosso-pharyngeal, and the pneumogastric ; others, again, are nerves of motion—as the third, the fourth, the smaller root of the fifth, the sixth, the facial division of the seventh, the spinal accessory, and the hypo- glossal.

First Pair or The olfactory nerve is triangular on section, the Olfactory apex of the triangle being lodged in a furrow Nerves. {olfactory sulcus) between the convolutions. It proceeds straight forwards under the frontal lobe, and terminates in the olfactory bulb, which lies on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The olfactory lobe is oval, of a reddish-grey colour, and very soft consistence, owing to the large amount of grey matter contained in it. It gives off from its under surface about twenty branches, q q 2

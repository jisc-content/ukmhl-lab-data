LIGAMENTS OP THE PELVIS. 565 Pubic Sym- This is secured by, 1, an anterior ligament, PHYSIS- consisting of irregular superficial fibres which run obliquely, and of deep fibres which pass transversely; 2, a pos- terior ligament, less distinct; 3, a sub-pubic ligament: it is very strong, and rounds off the point of the pubic arch ; 4, a superior ligament which passes across the upper surface of the pubic bones ; 5, an intermediate fibro-cartilage. A perpendicular section through it shows that it consists of concentric layers, and that its general structure resembles that between the bodies of the vertebras. In the upper and back part of this fibro-cartilage is a Fig. 130. Great sacro-ischiatic ligament- Lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament. smooth cavity lined with epithelium. The cartilage acts like a buffer, and breaks the force of shocks passing through the pelvic arch. The ilium is connected with the fifth lumbar vertebra by the ilio-lumbar ligament. It is very strong, and extends from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium (fig. 131). Sacroiliac This is secured by, 1, an anterior ligament Symphysis. which consists of ligamentous fibres passing in front; 2, a posterior ligament, composed of fibres much stronger

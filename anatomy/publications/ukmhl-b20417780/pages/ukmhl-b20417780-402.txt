Several small branches to the pancreas, pancreaticce parvce. One, rather larger than the rest, which accompanies the pan- creatic duct, is called pancreatica magna. 2. The gastro-epiploica sinistra, which runs to the right along the great curve of the stomach, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra, 3. Vasa brevia, which proceed between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of the stomach, where they communicate with branches from the coronaria ventriculi, and the gastro-epiploica sinistra. 4. The splenic branches are five or six in number, and enter the fissure of the spleen. Thus the stomach is supplied with blood by four channels, which by their inosculations form a main artery along its lesser curve, another along its greater ; from these, nu- merous branches are fur- nished to both surfaces of the stomach. The artery of the greater curve also sends down numerous omen- tal branches, which form a network between the layers of the great omentum.

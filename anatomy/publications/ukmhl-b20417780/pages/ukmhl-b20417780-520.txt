PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. 506 Sheath of the Femoral Vessels The femoral vessels descend beneath the crural arch, enclosed in a funnel-shaped membranous sheath. This sheath appears to be derived immediately from the arch itself, but it is really formed, in front, by a prolongation from the fascia transversalis of the abdomen. This prolongation, uniting with the continuation from the fascia iliaca to join the fascia lata behind the femoral vessels, forms a funnel, with the wide part uppermost, into which the femoral vessels enter. This is the funnel-shaped sheath of the femoral vessels. Fig. 11 1,1. Fascia transver- 2. Internal ring. 3. Crural arch re- flected. 4. Sheath of the fe- moral vessels. 5. Saphena vein. DIAGRAM OF THE SHEATH OF THE FEMORAL VESSELS. To examine this sheath satisfactorily, it is necessary to reflect, from its attachment to the crural arch, the upper horn of the saphenous opening, as shown in fig. 118. By this proceeding, we expose the fascia transversalis descending over the femoral vessels, and forming the front part of their sheath. The hind part of the sheath is formed by the fascia iliaca, which runs down behind the vessels to join the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The sheath descends as low as the lower horn of the saphenous opening, where it is gradually lost upon the ordinary fibrous investment of the femoral vessels. The outer part of the sheath

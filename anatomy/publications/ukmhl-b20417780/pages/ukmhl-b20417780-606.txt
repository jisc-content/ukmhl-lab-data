592 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. of Sylvius. It consists of a number of hidden convolutions (gyri operti) connected; with those adjoining it, arid corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum. The frontal lobe is on its external surface divided by two frontal fissures into a superior, middle, and inferior frontal; convolution (fig. 143). The only fissure of the parietal lobe is the inter-parietal sulcus, which separates the upper from the lower parietal convolution, which, latter is occasionally divided into the supra-marginal and angular gyrus ; the one being above, the other behind .the fissure of CONVOLUTIONS AND FISSURES- OF THE MEDIAN AND TENTORIAL SURFACES OF RIGHT HEMISPHERE. Sylvius. Behind the fissure of Rolando is the ascending parietal convolution, which is usually continuous with the ascending frontal convolution, above and below the fissure. The occipital lobe is composed of a superior, middle, and in- ferior occipital convolution, separated by ill-defined sulci, and connected with some parietal and temporo-sphenoidal convolutions Fig. 144. c.c.

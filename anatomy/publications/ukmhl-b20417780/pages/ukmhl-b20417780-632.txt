618 DISSECTION" OF THE SPINAL COED. large tortuous veins which extend down the spinal canal, behind the bodies of the vertebrae. 4. The posterior longitudinal spinal veins, like the anterior, run along the whole length of the spinal canal. They form a tortuous venous plexus, situated inside the vertebral arches, and communicate with the anterior longitudinal veins by cross branches at frequent intervals. 5. The proper veins of the spinal cord lie within the dura mater. They form a fine plexiform arrangement of veins over both sur- faces of the cord, and can with difficulty be injected from the other spinal veins. This complicated system of veins dis- charges itself through the intervertebral foramina in the several Fig. 155. 1. Anterior external veins. 2. Posterior external veins. 3.

(Transverse section.) regions of the spine, as follows :—In the cervical, into the vertebral veins; in the dorsal, into the intercostal veins ; in the lumbar, into the lumbar veins. None are provided with valves : hence they are liable to become congested in diseases of the spine. The membranes of the spinal cord, though continuous with those of the brain, differ from them in certain respects, and require separate notice. D M The dura mater of the cord is a tough fibrous membrane like that of the brain, but does not adhere to the bones, being separated from them by fat, loose areolar tissue, and the plexus of veins described above. Moreover, such adhesion would impede the free movement of the vertebrae

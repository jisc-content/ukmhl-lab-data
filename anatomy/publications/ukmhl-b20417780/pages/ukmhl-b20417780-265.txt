LIGAMENTS OF THE RIBS. 251 Articulation All the ribs, with the exception of the first and of the Ribs. the two. last, are articulated with the bodies of two vertebra?, and with the transverse processes (fig. 49). The headof each rib presents two articular surfaces, correspond- ing to the bodies of two vertebra?. There are two distinct articu- lations, each provided with a separate synovial membrane. The ligaments are :—1. An anterior, which connects the head of the rib with the vertebra?, and with the intervening fibro-cartilage: this, on account of the divergence of its fibres, is called the stel- late ligament (fig.,50). 2-An inter*articular, which proceeds from the head of the rib to the intervertebral cartilage. Fig. 49. DI AGE AM SHOWING THE LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE RIB "WITH THE VERTEBRA. 1. The anterior costo-central ligament. 3. The posterior costo-transverse ligament. 2. The interosseous, or middle costo-transverse 4. The synovial membrane between the rib and ligament. the body of the vertebra. The tubercle of the rib articulates with the transverse process. This articulation has a capsular and synovial membrane, and is secured by the following ligaments:—1. The posterior costo- transverse passes from the apex of the transverse process to the summit of the tubercle of the rib. 2. The middle costo-trans- verse connects the neck of the rib to the front surface of the transverse process. 3. The superior costo-transverse ascends from the neck of the rib to the lower border of the transverse process above it (fig. 50).

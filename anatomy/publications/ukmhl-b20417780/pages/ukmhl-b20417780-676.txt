DISSECTION OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 662 interims. These enter the canals in the base of the modiolus, and then arch outwards between the plates of the lamina ossea. In their course outwards between the plates, they pass through the spirally arranged gangiionic cells, beyond which they form a wide plexus. They are collected together close to the free border of the osseous zone, forming a very minute nerve-plexus, whose filaments interlace freely ; they then enter the membranous zone to be con- nected with the inner hair-cells of the organ of Corti.* The vessels which supply the cochlea are from ten to twelve in number, and are derived from the auditory artery ; they, like the nerves, enter the bony canals of the modiolus, and then turn out- wards to ramify upon the osseous zone, supplying its periosteum. The plexus formed by these branches communicates with a vessel known as the vas spirale, which runs longitudinally in the liga- mentum spirale to the outer attachment of the membrana basil- aris. The veins from the cochlea terminate in the superior petrosal sinus, having previously joined those of the vestibule and semicircular canals. * Some anatomists describe filaments as passing between the rods of Corti to end in the outer hair-cells.

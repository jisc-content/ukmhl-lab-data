LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 569 Pig. 132. The proper ligaments of the joint areâ€”1, the lateral; 2, the crucial in the interior. Internal This is a broad flat band, which extends from Lateral Liga- the inner condyle of the femur to the inner side MENT. of ^ a Httle bel()w head 132). A few of the deeper fibres are attached to the inner semi-lunar carti- lage, and serve to keep it in place. The inferior internal articular artery, and part of the tendon of the semimembranosus, pass under- neath this ligament. In the several motions of the joint, there is a certain amount of friction between the ligament and the head of the tibia, and consequently a small bursa is in- terposed. External La- This is a strong teral Ligament, round band, which ex- tends from the outer condyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. This ligament separates the two divisions of the tendinous insertion of the biceps. Posterior to, and running parallel with, the external lateral ligament is a smaller band of fibres, called the short external lateral ligament. Posterior This, which is gene- Ligament. rally called 6 ligamen- tum posticum WinslowiiJ consists of expansions derived from the tendons at the back of the joint, chiefly, however, from the semimembranosus (p. 546). It extends from the posterior part of the tuberosity of the tibia to the outer condyle of the femur. It not only closes and protects the joint behind, but prevents its extension beyond the perpendicular. The joint should be opened above the patella. Observe the great extent of the fold which the synovial membrane forms above this bone.* It allows the free play of the bone over the lower part * In performing operations near the knee, the joint should always be bent, in order to draw the synovial fold as much as possible out of the way, diagram of the semi-lunar cartilages and lateral li- gaments OF THE KNEE. 1.

BRACHIAL PLEXUS OF NERVES. 71 axilla, completely surround the artery: one cord lying to the outer side, a second lying to the inner side, and a third behind the vessel. The plexus is crossed superficially by the omo-hyoid muscle, and by the supra-scapular and posterior scapular arteries. The arrangement of the nerves in the formation of the plexus Fig. 13.

The most usual arrangement is, that at the outer border of the scalenus anticus, the fifth and sixth cervical n. unite to form an upper trunk; the eighth and the first dorsal n. form a lower trunk; the

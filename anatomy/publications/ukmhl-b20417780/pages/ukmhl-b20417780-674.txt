The upper scale is subdivided by an oblique membrane—membrane of Reissner—into two canals, an inner, the scala vestibuli, and an outer, the ductus cochlearis. The ductus cochlearis or scala media terminates at the helicotrema in a cul-de-sac; interiorly it is connected with the cavity of the saccule by a long, narrow duct, called the canalis reuniens. On examining the membranous continuation of the lamina spiralis, it is seen, not far from its attachment to the osseous zone, Fig. 168. DIAGRAMMATIC SECTION OF A COIL OF THE COCHLEA.

The structure of the limbus consists of firm connective tissue, on the under part of which are found numerous cells. The basilar membrane forms, at the base of the cochlea, but a small breadth of the septum, the broadest part being formed of bone, but it gradually increases in breadth towards the cupola, where it constitutes nearly the entire septum.

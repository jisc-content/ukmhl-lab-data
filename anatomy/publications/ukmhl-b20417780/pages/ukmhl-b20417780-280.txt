265 BRANCHES OF AXILLARY ARTERY. r CIRCUMFLEX Arteries, ante- | rior and pos- TERIOR. There are two circumflex arteriesâ€”an anterior and a posterior, so called from the manner in which they encircle the neck of the humerus. The posterior circumflex artery is as large as the subscapular, close to which it is given off; or both may arise from a common trunk from the axillary. It passes backwards through a quadrilateral space, bounded above by the subscapularis and teres minor, below by the teres major, externally by the neck of the humerus, and internally by the long head of the triceps \ (fig. 53). It then winds round the back of the neck of^ the Fig. 53. 1. Subscapularis. 2. Teres major. 3. Long head of triceps. 4. Square space for cir cumflex a. and n.

Besides the deltoid, the posterior circumflex artery supplies the long head of the triceps, the head of the humerus, and the shoulder- joint. It inosculates above with the acromio-thoracic and supra- scapular arteries, below with the ascending branch of the superior profunda (a branch of the brachial), and in front with the anterior circumflex artery. Should you not find the posterior circumflex artery in its normal position, look for it (as a branch of the brachial) below the tendon of the teres major. 5.

On each side of the larynx, between the true and false vocal cords, is a small recess, the ventricle of the larynx, leading into a pouch called the sacculus laryngis, which ascends for a short distance and terminates in a cul-de-sac by the side of the thyroid cartilage. In the middle line below the base of the epiglottis is seen a round elevation covered with mucous membrane of a bright red colour: this is termed the cushion of the epiglottis. The length of the rima glottidis in the male is eleven lines; its width at rest from three to four lines; in the female its length is eight lines, its width two lines.

They are called the false vocal cords because they have little or nothing to do with the production of the voice. They are composed of elastic tissue, like the true vocal cords; but they also contain fatty tissue, which the true ones do not.

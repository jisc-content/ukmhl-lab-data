The lateral columns on reaching the medulla oblongata are disposed off in three ways, as follows:â€”some of its fibres come forward between the diverging anterior columns, decussate in the middle line and form part of the pyramid of the opposite side; Fig. 158. 1.

Restiform The posterior columns ascend (under the name Body, of the restiform bodies), at the back of the medulla, diverge from each other, and are continued partly into the cere- bellum, forming its inferior crura, and partly as the fasciculi teretes along the floor of the fourth ventricle into the cerebrum. s s 2

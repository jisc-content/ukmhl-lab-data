Upper Sur- The upper surface of the cerebellum slopes on FACH- each side, having- a ridge along the middle line, called the superior vermiform process. This process presents three eminences, au anterior, middle, and posterior, which are named respectively, the lobulus centralis, the monticulus cere- belli, and the commissura simplex. The hemispheres are sepa- rated posteriorly by a deep notch, the incisura cerebelli posterior, which receives the falx cerebelli. On this surface of the cerebel- lum are two lobes, one of which, the quadrate, is situated on its Fig. 152. SUPERIOR SURFACE OF THE CEREBELLUM. i c s. Inoisura cerebelli anterior. icp.

The front part of it is occupied by the medulla oblongata. To examine the surface of the valley the medulla must be raised,, and the hemispheres separated from each other. Along the middle line of the vallecula is the inferior vermiform process,

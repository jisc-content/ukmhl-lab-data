DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. 203 nection with the ultimate distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve.* The papillw fungiforms, smaller and more numerous than the circumvallatce, are scattered chiefly over the sides and tip of the tongue, and sparingly over its upper surface. They vary in shape, some being cylindrical, others having rounded heads like mushrooms; whence their name. Near the apex of the tongue they may be distin- guished during life from the other papillae by their redder colour. In scarlatina, and some exanthematous fevers, these papilla? become elongated, and of a bright red colour: as the fever subsides, their points acquire a brownish tint; giving rise to what is called the strawberry tongue. The papillae filiformce are the smallest and most numerous. They are so closely aggregated that they give the tongue a velvet-like appearance. Their points are directed backwards, so that the tongue feels smooth if the finger be passed over it from tongue, with the fauces ° i AND TONSILS. apex to base, but rough if in the contrary h Papilla3 circumvauat£e. direction. These papillae .consist of small 2* Papmffi fu^i£orm8e- conical processes arranged for the most part in a series of lines running parallel to the two rows of the papillae circumvallata?. Each papilla is covered with a thick layer of epithelium, which is prolonged into a number of free hairlike processes. If the papillae be injected, and examined under the microscope, it is found that they are not simple elevations, like those of the skin, but that from them arise secondary papilla?. The papilla? circumvallata? consist of an aggregation of smaller papilla? arranged parallel to each other; and the papilla? fungiforma? consist of cen- tral stems from which minute secondary papilla? shoot off.

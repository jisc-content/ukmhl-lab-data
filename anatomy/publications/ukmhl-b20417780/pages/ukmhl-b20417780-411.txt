DIAPHKAGM. 397 somewhat like the letter X.* Above the decussation, and a little to the left of it, is" the oesophageal opening; this is oval and entirely muscular, and transmits the oesophagus and the pneumo- gastric nerves. &The opening for the vena cava {foramen auaa,ratum) is situated in the highest part of the cen- tral tendon, rather to the right of the middle line. Observe that the vein is intimately connected to its margin, and kept perma- nently open. Lastly, there pass through the cms, on each side, the sympathetic and the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. The arch of the diaphragm, in expiration, extends about as high as the fifth rib on the right side, and the sixth rib on the left. The nerves of the dia- phragm are the phrenic (p. 132), and the five or six lower inter- costal nerves. The diaphragm also receives minute filaments from the diaphragmatic plexus, which comes from the semilunar ganglia. On its under surface on the right side, close to the supra-renal capsule, the plexus joins some branches of the right phrenic nerve, at which spot there is a small ganglion (ganglion diaphragmaticum), from which filaments are given off to the liver, vena cava and supra-renal capsule. It is absent on the left side. Its blood-vessels are the two phrenic, derived from the aorta, the internal mammary (p. 121), and the lower intercostal. Function of The diaphragm is the great muscle concerned the Diaphragm. in inspiration. It may be said with Haller, that it Fig. 85. DIAPHRAGM FROM ITS UPPER SURFACE.

But the right crus always crosses more or less over the left, so that the crura are never strictly parallel.

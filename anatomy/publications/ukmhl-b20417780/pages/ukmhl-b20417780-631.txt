617 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. To examine, in situ, the spinal cord covered with its mem- branes, the arches of the vertebrae must be sawn through, and removed. It is then noticed that the cord does not occupy the whole cavity of the spinal canal. The dura mater does not adhere to the vertebras, and does not form their internal periosteum, as in the skull. Between the bones and this membrane, a space inter- venes, which is filled with a soft reddish-looking fat, with watery cellular tissue, and the ramifications of a plexus of veins. Fig. 154. 1.

The posterior external veins which form a tortuous plexus outside the arches and spinous processes of the vertebrae; they send off branches, which pass through the ligamenta subflava, and end in the plexus inside the vertebral canal. 2.

219 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. c. Posterior dental branches, two in number. They descend along the back part of the superior maxillary bone. One lies between the periosteum and the bone, and supplies the gums and mucous membrane ; the other passes through a foramen in company with a small artery, and running in an osseous canal supplies the molar teeth and the antrum; it gives off also a small branch which communicates with the anterior den- tal nerve. d. Anterior dental branch.â€”This is given off just before the nerve emerges from the infra-orbital foramen. It descends in a special canal Fig. 44.

Glosso-pharyngeal n. giving off tympanic branch. in the anterior wall of the upper jaw, and divides into branches, which distribute filaments to the incisor, canine, and bicuspid teeth, the mu- cous membrane of the antrum and the gums.

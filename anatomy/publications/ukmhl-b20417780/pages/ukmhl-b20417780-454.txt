At this stage of the dissection, the bladder Dissection should be drawn downwards, and the branches of the internal iliac artery and the sacral plexus clearly displayed. Internal From the division of the common iliac artery, Iliac Artery the internal iliac descends into the pelvis, and, and Branches. after a course of about an inch and a half, divides, opposite the great sacro-ischiatic notch, into two large branches, an anterior and a posterior (fig. 98). The artery lies upon the Fig. 98. plan of the branches of the internal iliac. iumbo-sacral cord, the pyriformis muscle, the external and internal iliac veins; the ureter, enclosed in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, passing in front. The posterior division gives off the ilio-lumbar,'lateral sacral, and gluteal arteries; the anterior gives off the superior vesical, obturator, inferior vesical, middle hsemorrhoidal, ischiatic and pudic; also the uterine and vaginal in the female. Such is their usual order; but these branches, though constant as to their general distribution, vary-as to their origin. The branches of the posterior division are â€” a. The ilio-lumbar is analogous to the lumbar branches of the

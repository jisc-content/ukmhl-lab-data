668 DISSECTION OF THE TESTIS. invests the testicle, but not the epididymis. At the posterior part of the gland it penetrates into its substance for a short distance, and forms an incomplete vertical septum, termed, after the anatomist who first discovered it, corpus Highmorianum, and subsequently by Sir A. Cooper, mediastinum testis (fig. 170). This septum transmits the blood-vessels of the organ, and contains also the network of seminal ducts, called the rete testis, shown in diagram (fig. 169). From the mediastinum testis are given off, in all directions, a number of diverging slender fibrous cords, which traverse the interior of the gland, and are attached to the inside of the tunica Fig. 170. 1.

They serve to maintain the general shape of the testi- cle, to support the numerous lobules of which its glandular sub- stance is composed, and to convey the blood-vessels into it. These septa (trabecule testis) as well as the mediastinum from which they proceed, are readily seen on making a transverse section through the gland (fig. 170).* Tunica Kespecting the so-called tunica vasculosa Vasculosa. nothing more need be said than that it consists of a multitude of minute blood-vessels, formed by the ramifications of * Kolliker has demonstrated unstriped muscular fibres upon the septa as well as the mediastinum,

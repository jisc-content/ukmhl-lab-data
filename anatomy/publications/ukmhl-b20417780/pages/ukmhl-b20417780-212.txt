Aryte- This single muscle is situated immediately at noideus. the back of the arytenoid cartilages. The fibres pass across from one cartilage to the other running in a transverse direction. Action.—By approximating the arytenoid cartilages, they assist in contracting the glottis. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. M. Abyteno- This muscle arises from the ;outer angle of the ■shfiglottideus. arytenoid cartilage and, crossing its fellow like Fig. 37. Vocalcord . ... Thyroid cartilage Cricoid cartilage.

Crico- To expose this muscle, cut away the ala of the arytenoideus thyroid cartilage. It arises from the upper Lateralis. border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and is i inserted into 'the external angle of the base of the arytenoid in front of the crico-arytenoideus posticus. Action.—By drawing the arytenoid cartilages inwards, the muscles of opposite sides contract the glottis (fig. 38). Its nerve comes from the inferior * laryngeal.

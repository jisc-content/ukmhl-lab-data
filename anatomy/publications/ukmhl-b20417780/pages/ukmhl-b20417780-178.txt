164 DISSECTION OF THE HEART. Other veins, known as the posterior cardiac, three or four in number, ascend along the posterior surface of the heart, to open by valved orifices into the coronary sinus ; while others, the anterior cardiac veins, are seen running up on the anterior surface of the right ventricle to terminate directly in the right auricle. The coronary sinus is about an inch in length, and its orifice in the right auricle is guarded by a valve (valve of Thebesius) to prevent regurgitation of the blood. It is covered and more or less supported in its course by muscular fibres passing from one auricle to the other. Fig. 30. DIAGRAM OF THE .RELATIVE POSITION OF THE VALVES OF THE HEART, SEEN FROM ABOVE. A is placed on the triangular interval where the fibrous skeleton is the thickest. Fibrous Zones What may be termed the fibrous skeleton of or Skeleton of the heart, consists of four rings which surround, the Heart. respectively, the four orifices at its base : namely, the two auriculo-ventricular, the aortic, and the pulmonary. These rings give attachment by their external circumference to the muscular fibres of the heart, and from their internal circumference send fibrous prolongations to form the framework of the several valves. The skeleton is strongest just in the triangular interspace

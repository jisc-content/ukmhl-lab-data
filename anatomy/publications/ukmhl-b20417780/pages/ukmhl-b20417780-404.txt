MESENTERIC VESSELS. 390 Dissection. The great omentum, with the arch of the colon, must now be turned up over the chest, and the small intestines pushed towards the left side. Then, by removing the anterior layer of the peritoneum from the mesentery, we expose the mode in which the superior mesenteric artery ramifies so as to supply the small intestine. In making this dissection, the mesen- teric glands immediately attract notice. They lie in great numbers between the layers of the mesentery, and vary consider- ably in size. The fine tubes, called lacteal vessels, which traverse Fig. 83. 1. Superior mesenteric a. 2. Colica media. 3. Colica dextra. 4. Ileo-colica. 5. Inferior mesenteric a. 6. Colica sinistra. 7.

But in cases where sudden death has taken place during digestion, they are found distended with chyle, and can be traced into the glands from all parts of the small intestine.* After traversing the glands, they all eventually empty their contents into the receptaculum chyli (p. 142). * The arrangement of the chyliferous vessels is Maseagni. well displayed in the plates of

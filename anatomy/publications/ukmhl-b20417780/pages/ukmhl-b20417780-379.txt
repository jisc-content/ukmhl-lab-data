Inferiorly, it is attached to the crest of the ilium and to Poupart's ligament, where it becomes continuous with the fascia covering the iliacus internus (fascia iliaca).

Its inner border is connected with the margin of the rectus, to the lower margin of the conjoined tendon, and also to the pubes. This fascia is strongest just behind the external Fig. 73.

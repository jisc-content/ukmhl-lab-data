169 STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. 2. The ductus venosus also becomes closed about the same period. 3. The foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus become com- pletely closed from the sixth to the tenth day. 4. The pulmonary arteries enlarge and convey venous blood to the lungs. These organs during fetal life receive only a small quantity of blood from these arteries. 5. The hypogastric arteries become obliterated on the fourth or fifth day after birth. STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. The lungs are very vascular spongy organs in which the blood is oxygenated by exposure to atmospheric air. Their situation and shape have been briefly described (p. 140). We must now examine the trachea, the common air-passage to both lungs, and then trace this tube downwards to its bifurcation into the two bronchi, which, with their minute subdivisions, form the main structure of the lungs. Teachea This ^s a Partty membranous, partly cartila- ginous tube, and is situated in the middle line. It extends from the cricoid cartilage, i.e. opposite the upper border of the sixth cervical vertebra, to the third dorsal ver- tebra, where it divides into two tubes, the right and left bronchus: one for each lung. Its length is from four to four and a half inches, and its width from eight to ten lines; but these measurements vary according to the age of the patient and the capacity of the lungs. The trachea is surrounded by a quantity of loose connective tissue, so as to allow of its free mobility. It is kept permanently open by a series of incomplete cartilaginous rings, from sixteen to twenty in number, which extend round the anterior two-thirds of its circumference. These rings are deficient at the posterior part of the tube, where it is completed by a fibro- muscular membrane. This deficiency allows the trachea to enlarge or diminish its calibre; and for this purpose the membranous part

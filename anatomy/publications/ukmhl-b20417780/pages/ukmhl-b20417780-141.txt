VENA CAVA SUPERIOR. 127 deviation should be borne in mind in the performance of tra- cheotomy. The right brachiocephalic vein descends nearly vertically to join the superior vena cava, opposite the first right intercostal space. It is about an inch and a half in length, and is situated about one inch from the mesial line of the sternum. On its left side, but on a posterior plane, runs the arteria innominata ; on its right side is the pleura. Between the vein and the pleura is the phrenic nerve. The brachio-cephalic veins are not provided with valves. The veins which generally empty themselves into the right and left brachio-cephalic are as follows :— The Eight B. C. Vein receives :- The vertebral. The deep cervical (not drawn). The internal mammary. The middle thyroid (sometimes). The Left B. C. Vein receives:— The vertebral. The deep cervical (not drawn). The internal mammary. The middle thyroid. The superior intercostal. The pericardiac. Fig. 22. Inferior thyroid. Internal jugular. External jugular. _ Vertebral. Supra-scapular. Posterior scapular.

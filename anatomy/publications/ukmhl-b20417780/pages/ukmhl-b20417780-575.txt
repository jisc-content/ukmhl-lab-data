561 SOLE OF THE FOOT. The internal plantar artery is very small: it passes forwards "between the abductor pollicis and the flexor brevis digitorum to the base of the great toe, and then is continued along the inner side of that toe, where it terminates in small inosculations with the digital arteries. Its chief use is to supply the muscles between which it runs. The external plantar is the principal artery of the sole, and alone forms the plantar arch (fig. 129). It runs obliquely outwards across the sole to- wards the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; then, sinking deeply, it bends inwards across the bases of the metatarsal bones, and inos- culates with the dorsalis pedis in the first interosseous space. At first it lies between the os calcis and the abductor pollicis; it then passes between the flexor brevis digi- torum and the flexor accessorius ; and, lastly, it lies deep beneath the flexor tendons, and the adductor pollicis, close to the metatarsal bones. Deeply seated as it appears to be, that part of its curve near the fifth metatarsal bone lies immediately beneath the fascia. The external plantar sends a branch to the skin of the heel, and another round the outer edge of the foot; but its chief branches are the four digital arteries, which arise in the deepest part Of its COUrSe. They l. Internal plantar artery. supply both sides of the fifth, fourth, third, 2' Exteinal and the outer side of the second toe; the great toe, and the inside of the second, being supplied by the dorsalis hallucis. Concerning the ultimate distribution of the digital arteries, refer to the ac- count given of these arteries in the hand (p. 300). Besides the digital arteries, the arch gives off three small branches—the perforating—which ascend between the three outer interosseous spaces, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries at each end of the spaces. 0 o

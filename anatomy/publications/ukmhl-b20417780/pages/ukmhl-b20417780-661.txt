DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 647 cessive layer becomes more dense, so that the central part is hardT and constitutes the nucleus. It is seen to be divided into three equal parts, by three lines, which radiate from the centre to within one-third of the circumference. Each of these portions is com- posed of numerous concentric layers, arranged one within the other, like the coats of an onion. If any single layer be examined with the microscope, it is seen to be composed of fibres about ^V^th of an inch in thickness, running in a curved direction, and connected together by finely serrated edges. On a transverse section the lens fibres are found to be hexagonal prisms, with very little connecting substance. Between the front of the lens and its capsule is a layer of flattened cells with well-marked excentric nuclei. The beautiful dove-tailing of the fibres of the lens was first pointed out by Sir David Brewster; and to see it in perfec- tion, one ought to examine the lens of the cod-fish. The function of the lens is to bring the rays of light to a focus upon the retina.* * The lens contains about 60 per cent, of water, and 30 per cent of albuminoids.

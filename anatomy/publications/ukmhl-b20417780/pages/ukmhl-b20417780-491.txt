STRUCTURE OF THE LIVER. 477 lobulus caudatus. The lobulus quadratics is situated between the gall-bladder, the longitudinal, and the transverse fissure. This lobe is occasionally connected with the left lobe by a bridge of hepatic substance (pons hepatis) which arches over the longi- tudinal fissure. The liver has five ligaments, of which the coronary, the right and left lateral, and the falciform are reflections of the peritoneum ; the fifth is the round ligament in the anterior free border of the falciform ligament; it consists of the remains of the umbilical vein. The ligaments have been previously described (p. 377). Fig. 107. DIAGRAM OF THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE LIVER. The liver is surrounded by a thin areolar coat or capsule, best seen on those parts of it not covered with peritoneum. This coat is connected to the areolar tissue which surrounds the lobules, but does not send down partitions to form a framework for the interior of the gland. It is continuous, at the transverse fissure, with -the sheath of loose areolar tissue called Glisson's capsule, which surrounds the vessels as they enter that fissure, and in- closes them in a common sheath in their ramifications through the liver. The inter-lobular areolar tissue is exceedingly delicate; hence

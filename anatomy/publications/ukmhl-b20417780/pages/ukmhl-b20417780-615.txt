DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 601 fresh brain, two longitudinal white tracts, named the nerves of Lancisi, run parallel to it; and external to these again are two other longitudinal fibres, stria? longitudinales later ales. The surface of the corpus callosum is marked by transverse lines which indicate the course of its fibres; these are the linear transversa? of the old anatomists. The anterior cerebral arteries proceed along the surface of the corpus callosum to the back of the brain. Fig. 148. Foramen of Monro . Middle commissure . Anterior.commissure. Lamina cinerea . .

The anterior part of the corpus callosum turns downwards and backwards, forming a bend called its genu. The inferior part of this bend—rostrum—becomes gradually thinner and narrower, and terminates in two peduncles, which diverge from each other, and are lost, one in each fissure of Sylvius. Between these crura is placed the lamina cinerea (fig. 147). The posterior part of the corpus callcsum terminates in a thick, round border which is free, and beneath it the pia mater enters the interior of

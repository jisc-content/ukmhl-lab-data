4 NERVES OF THE SCALP. Nerves of the The sensory nerves of the scalp are supplied Scalp, from each of the three divisions, namely the ophthalmic, the superior maxillary and inferior maxillary, of the fifth pair; also from the second cervical nerve. The nerves to the muscles of the scalp and ear come from the portio dura or seventh pair (fig. 1). Fig. 1. DIAGRAM OF THE NERVES OF THE SCALP. 1. Supra-troch1ear. 5. Facial represented by dotted lines. 2. Supra-orbital. 6. Posterior auricular. 3. Temporal br. of the superior maxillary. 7. Small occipital. 4. Auriculo-temporal br. of the inferior maxillary. 8. Great occipital. The supra-trocldear nerve is derived from the frontal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth. It appears at the inner angle of the orbit, and supplies the skin of the forehead, and the upper eyelid. The supra-orbital nerve is a continuation of the frontal branch of the fifth. It emerges from the orbit through the notch in the frontal bone, and subdivides into branches, which are covered at first by the fibres of the orbicularis and occipito-frontalis; 2>ut they presently become subcu- taneous, and terminate in two branchesâ€”an inner, which ascends, to

165 DISSECTIOK" OF THE HEART. between the aortic and the two auriculo-ventricular orifices (letter a in fig. 30). In some animals, as in the ox and the elephant, there is here an irregularly triangular bone, known as the 4 os cordis.' The relative position of these rings is best seen by removing the auricles and the great vessels at the base of the heartâ€”leaving the several valves, and looking at them from above, as shown in the diagram. The pulmonary ring is on the highest level, and nearest to the sternum ; below it, is the aortic ring lying between and in front of the auriculo-ventricular rings, which are on the lowest level. Attachment of Tne nDr0US rings at tne arterial orifices present the Large Arte- three festoons with their concavities directed up- eies to the wards. These give attachment, above, to the middle coat of the artery ; below, to the muscular fibres of the heart; and, internally, to the fibrous tissue of the valves. The vessels are also connected to the heart by the serous layer of the pericardium, and by a continuation of the lining membrane of the ventricle. This smooth membrane lining1 the cavities of Endocardium, tit. T the heart resembles the visceral layer of the peri- cardium, and is continuous with the lining membrane of the blood-vessels. It may be easily stripped off, and is thin and semi-transparent, thicker in the left than in the right cavities, thickest of all in the left auricle. It consists of three layers: 1, a layer of flattened polygonal cells, resting upon, 2, some elastic fibres resembling the fenestrated coat of an artery, and, 3, a thin layer of connective tissue. Arrangement ^he muscular fibres of the heart are of the of the Muscular striped variety, but differ from ordinary striped Fibres of the muscular tissue, in being smaller, destitute of sarco- lemma, branched, nucleated, and involuntary. The fibres of the auricles are distinct from those of the ventricles. They consist of a superficial layer common to both cavities, and a deeper layer proper to each. The superficial fibres run transversely across the auricles, and are most marked on the anterior surface ; some pass into the septum. Of the deeper fibres, some are annu-

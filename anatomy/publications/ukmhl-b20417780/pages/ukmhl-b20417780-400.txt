The coeliac axis arises from the front of the aorta, between the pillars of the diaphragm, im- mediately above the upper border of the pancreas, and to the left of the lobulus Spigelii. It is a very thick, short trunk, which runs between the two layers of the lesser omentum, and, after a course of about half an inch, divides into three branches—the coronaria ventriculi, the splenic, and the hepatic. Coronaeia The coronaria ventriculi, the smallest of the Ventriculi. three, ascends a little to the left towards the oesophageal end of the stomach, where it gives off oesophageal branches, which inosculate with the oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. It then runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach towards the pylorus, and anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. Hepatic The hepatic artery ascends to the right between Artery. the layers of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, for the supply of the respective lobes of the liver. In its course to the liver, it lies to the left of the bile-duct, and in front of the portal vein; all three are contained in the right half of the lesser omentum. The hepatic gives off— a. The pyloric, which runs along the upper curve of the stomach from right to left, and inosculates with the coronaria ventriculi. b. The gastro-duodenalis, passing behind the ascending portion of the

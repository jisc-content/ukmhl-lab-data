SOLE OF THE FOOT. 559 Flexor Brevis This muscle arises from the under surface of Digitorum. the os calcis, between the two preceding, from the plantar fascia and the intermuscular septa. It passes forwards and divides into four tendons, which run superficial to those of the long flexor. Cut open the sheath which contains them ; follow them on to the toes, to see that each bifurcates over the first phalanx, to allow the long tendon to pass through; then the two slips, reuniting, are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx.

MUSCLES, VESSELS, AND NERVES OF THE SOLE OF THE RIGHT FOOT, AFTER REFLECTION OF THE FLEXOR BREVIS DIGITORUM. The same arrangement prevails in the ringers. It is supplied by the internal plantar nerve. The three superficial muscles should now be reflected, by saw- ing off about half an inch of the os calcis, and then turning it downwards with the muscles attached to it. This done, we bring into view the plantar vessels and nerves, the second layer of musclesâ€”i.e. the long flexor tendon of the great toe, that of the other toes, and the flexor accessorius.

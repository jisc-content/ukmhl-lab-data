The digitations of this muscle with the serratus magnus and latissimus dorsi must also be made out. Muscles of the The abdominal muscles, three on each side, Abdominal are arranged in strata, named, after the direction Wall- of their fibres, the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversalis. They terminate in front in strong aponeuroses, arranged so as to form a sheath for a broad muscle, called the rectus, which extends perpendicularly on each side the linea alba from the sternum to the pubes. External Ob- This muscle arises from the eight or nine lower uque. ribs, by as many pointed bundles, called digita- tions. The upper five of these interdi^-itate with similar bundles of the serratus magnus; the three lower correspond in like manner with the origin of the latissimus dorsi; but they cannot be seen unless the body be turned on the side. The upper part of this muscle descends obliquely forwards, and terminates in the apo- neurosis of the abdomen; the lower proceeds almost perpendicu- larly from the last ribs, and is inserted into the outer ]ip_oÂ£ more than the anterior half of the crest of the ilinm,^ The aponeurosis of the external oblique increases in strength, breadth, and thickness, as it approaches the lower margin of the abdomen, this being the situation where the greater pressure of the viscera requires the most effective support. Its tendinous fibres take the same direction as the muscle, and form by their decussation in the middle line the linea alba, which extends from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes.

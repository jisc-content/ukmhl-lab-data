THE DELTOID. 318 on the back of the scapula, and is continuous with the fascia of the arm. It dips down between the fibres of the muscle, dividing it into large bundles. This fascia must be removed. Deltoid ^e ^arÂ£e musc^e which covers the shoulder- joint is named deltoid, from its resemblance to the Greek A reversed. It arises from the external third of the clavicle, from the acromion, and from the spine of the scapula Fig. 59. 1. Supra-acromial br. of the cervical nerves. 2.

(POSTERIOR YIEW.) down to the triangular surface at its root. This origin, which corresponds to the insertion of the trapezius, is tendinous and fleshy everywhere, except at the commencement of the spine of the scapula, where it is simply tendinous, and connected with the infra-spinous aponeurosis. The muscular fibres descend, the an- terior backwards, the posterior forwards,-the middle perpendicu- larly ; all converge to a tendon which is inserted into a rough

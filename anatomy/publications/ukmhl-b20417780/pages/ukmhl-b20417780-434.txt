DISSECTION OF THE MALE PERINEUM. 420 ^Accelerator This muscle embraces the bulb of the urethra. UbiS2« It arises from a fibrous median raphe beneath the bulb, and from the tendinous centre of *lihe perineum. Starting from this origin, the fibres diverge, and are inserted as follows:— The upper ones proceed on either side round the corpus caver- nosum penis, like the branches of the letter V, and are fixed on its dorsal surface ; the middle completely embrace the bulb, like a ring, and meet in an aponeurosis on the upper surface of the urethra ; the lower are fixed to the anterior surface of the deep perineal fascia, often called the triangular ligament (fig. 90).* Fig. 90.

Thus, the entire muscle acts as a powerful compressor of the bulb, and expels the last drops of urine from this part of the urethra. By dividing the muscle along the middle line and turning back each half, its insertion, as above described, can be clearly made out.-f- Erector This muscle is moulded upon the crus of the Penis- penis. It arises from the inner surface of the tuber ischii; the fibres ascend, completely covering the crus, and * This muscle is called also the ejaculator urincB or the bulbo-cavrenosus, f According to Hobelt, the dorsal insertion of the upper fibres throws a prolonga- tion over the dorsal vessels of the penis.

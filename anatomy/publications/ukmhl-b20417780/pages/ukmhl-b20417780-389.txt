375 POSITION OF ABDOMINAL VISCERA. Commence- In the right iliac fossa, the small intestine ment of Laege opens into the left side of the colon, which is Intestine. easily recognised by its sacculated appearance: here the large intestine begins: here is the ilio-csecal valve (fig. 75). Immediately below the junction, the. large intestine is expanded into a blind pouch, called the ccecum or caput coli. Into the back part of this pouch opens a little tube closed at the other end, called the appendix vermiformis. This tube is gene- rally three inches long, about as thick as a large earthworm, and Fig. 75. 1. Ileum. 2. Cascum or caput coli.

The commence ment of the large intestine is generally confined by the peri- toneum to the iliac fossa, in which it lies.* Tracing it from this point, it ascends through the right lumbar region in front of the right kidney as high as the under surface of the liver, where it * But this is not invariably so. The bowel is, in some subjects, connected to the fossa by a fold of peritoneum or a meso-ccecum. I have seen this fold sufficiently loose to allow the caput coli to travel over to the left iliac fossa.

454 UEETHRA. throughout the rest of its course the canal exhibits on section the appearance of a transverse slit (fig-. 102). The urethra must be laid open from end to end, to see that the canal is not of uniform calibre throughout. The external orifice is the narrowest, and the least dilatable part; so that the urine may be expelled in a jet. Therefore, any instrument which will enter the meatus ought to pass into the bladder, if there be no stricture. The junction of the membranous with the bulbous part is almost as narrow. The 'prostatic and the membranous parts have been de- scribed (p. 438). The spongy part of the urethra, so termed because it is sur- rounded by the erectile tissue of the corpus spongiosum, is about six inches long. That part of it running through the bulb is Fig. 102.

In the centre of the glans penis the canal widens into a sinus, termed fossa navicularis. The most dilatable part of the urethra is the prostatic. Even the narrowest parts of the canal must admit of considerable dila- tation, since calculi of from three to four lines in diameter can pass through it. The common ejaculatory ducts open into the prostatic part of the urethra, by the side of the veru montanum. The ducts of Cowper's glands open into the bulbous part. Besides these glands, a number of ducts open into the urethra, proceeding from small glands situated in the submucous tissue. These ducts, called lacuna?, are large enough to admit a bristle, and run in the same

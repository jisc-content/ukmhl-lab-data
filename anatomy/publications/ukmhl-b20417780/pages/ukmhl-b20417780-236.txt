OTIC GANGLION. 222 It would seem to be more in accordance with modern views to regard the Vidian nerve, not as dividing to form the carotid and great superficial petrosal branches, but rather as formed by the junction of these branches. In this view, the Vidian runs, not from, but to the spheno-palatine ganglion. The otic ganglion is situated on the inner side of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, immediately below its exit through the foramen ovale (fig. 44). Its inner surface is in contact with the circumflexus palati muscle and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and immediately behind it is the middle meningeal artery. It is always small.* This ganglion has branches of connection with other nerves: namely,â€”a sensory from the auriculo-temporal nerve; a motor from the branch of the inferior maxillary which goes to the internal pterygoid muscle ; and a sympathetic from the plexus around the arteria meningea media. It communicates also with the facial and the glosso-pharyngeal nerves by the lesser petrosal nerve. This branch passes backwards either through the foramen ovale or the foramen spinosum, or through a small hole between them, and runs beneath the dura mater in a minute groove on the petrous bone, external to that for the great petrosal nerve. Here it divides into two filaments, one of which joins the facial nerve in the aquaeductus Fallopii, the other joins the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal. These nerves are difficult to trace, not only on account of their minuteness, but because they frequently run in canals in the temporal bone. The otic ganglion sends a branch forwards to the tensor palati, and one backwards to the tensor tympani. * J. Arnold. ' Diss, inang. med.,' &c. Heidelbergse, 1826.

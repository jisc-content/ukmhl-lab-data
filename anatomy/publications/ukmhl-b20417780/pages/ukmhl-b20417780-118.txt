104 INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. BRANCHES OF THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. Sensory Branches. Motor Branches. Auriculotemporal. To temporal muscle. Inferior dental. — masseter. Buccal. — external pterygoid. Gustatory or lingual. — internal pterygoid. — mylo-hyoideus. — anterior belly of digastricus. The branches to the temporal muscle, two in number, ante- rior and posterior, pass outwards close to the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and ascend with the temporal arteries to the muscle. The branch to the masseter runs outwards above the external pterygoid, through the sigmoid notch of the jaw, to the under surface of the muscle. The branch to the external pterygoid comes, apparently, from the buccal nerve in its passage through this muscle. The branch to the internal pterygoid muscle proceeds from the inner side of the main trunk, close to the otic ganglion, and descending between the internal pterygoid and the tensor palati, enters the inner aspect of the muscle. The buccal branch passes either above or between the fibres of the external pterygoid to the buccinator, where it spreads out into filaments, which supply the skin, mucous membrane, and glands of the cheek with common sensation. The motor power of the buccinator, remember, is derived from the. facial nerve. That this buccal branch is mainly sensory is proved by the action of the muscle still continuing when the motor division of the fifth nerve is paralysed. The evidence is corroborated by a case in which this buccal branch proceeded from the second division of the fifth nerve; no communication being discovered, after very

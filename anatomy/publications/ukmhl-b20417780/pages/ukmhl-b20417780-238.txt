GANGLIA OF THE GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL. 224 DISSECTION OF THE EIGHTH PAIR OE NERVES AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL. In this dissection we propose to examine the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves in the jugular fossa, and the ganglia and nerves belonging to them in this part of their course. These are difficult to trace, and cannot be followed unless the nerves have been previously hardened by spirit, and the bones softened in acid. The next thing to be done is to remove the outer wall of the jugular fossa. Gxosso-pha- This nerve emerges from the cranium through a etngeal Nerve. separate tube of dura mater, in front of that for the other two nerves of the eighth pair. Looking at it from the interior of the skull, we notice that it is situated in front and rather to the inner side of the jugular fossa, where it lies in a groove. In its passage through the foramen, the nerve presents two enlargements, termed the jugular and the petrous ganglia. The jugular ganglion* is found upon the nerve immediately after its entrance into the canal of the dura mater, and averages about the ~ of an inch in length and breadth. It is situated on the outer side of the nerve, and does not implicate all its fibres. According to our observation, this ganglion is not infrequently absent. The petrous ganglion] is situated upon the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, near the lower part of the jugular fossa. It is oval, about \ of an inch long, and involves all the filaments of the nerve. It is connected by filaments with the pneumogastric and sym- pathetic nerves, and it gives off the tympanic nerve. J The branches which connect this ganglion with the pneumogastric are, one to its auricular branch, and a second to the ganglion of the root. It is also connected with the sympathetic by a small fila- * Miiller, ' Medicin. Zeitung,' Berlin, 1833. No. 52. f Andersch, 'Fragm. Descript. Nerv.

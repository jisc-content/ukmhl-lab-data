BRANCHES OF AXILLARY ARTERY. 265 b. " The alar thoracic, variable in its origin, supplies the lymphatic glands and the connective tissue of the axilla. c. The inferior or long thoracic artery (external mammary) runs along the lower border of the pectoralis minor. It supplies the mammary gland, the serratus magnus and pectoral muscles, and maintains a free anastomosis with the short thoracic, internal mammary, and intercostal arteries. d. The subscapular is the largest branch of the axillary; it arises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis, and soon divides into an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branch runs along the anterior edge of the subscapu- laris towards the lower angle of the scapula. Its numerous branches Fig. 52. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. ].

The posterior branch (dorsalis scapulae) runs to the back of the scapula, through a triangular space, bounded in front by the long liead of the triceps ; below, by the teres major ; and above, by the subscapu- lar and teres minor (diagram, p. 266). On the back of the scapula, it divides into branches, which ramify close to the bone, supplying the infra- spinatus and teres minor, and anastomose with the supra-scapular and posterior scapular arteries (diagram, p. 69). The subscapular vein empties itself into the axillary vein.

285 DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM. The nerve gives off branches on the inner side of the humerus, to the inner and long heads of the triceps ; on the back of the humerus, to the external head of the triceps and the anconeus ; on the outer side of the humerus, to the supinator radii longus, the extensor carpi radialis longior, and the brachialis anticus (some- times) ; lastly, after perforating the septum, it gives off the upper and lower external cutaneous branches. ^ little above the elbow-joint the nerve divides into its two principal branches—the radial, which accompanies the radial artery along the forearm—and the 'posterior interosseous, which perforates the supinator brevis, and supplies the muscles on the back of the forearm. To sum up the muscular distribution of this great nerve, we may say that it supplies all the extensors of the forearm, wrist, thumb, and fingers; and all the supinators except one—namely, thebioeDS^(supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve), DISSECTION OF THE EEONT OF THE FOREARM. Prolong the incision down to the wrist, and, at its termination, make another transversely. Re- flect the skin, and dissect the subcutaneous veins and nerves. Cutaneous On the inner side is the anterior ulnar vein, Veins. which commences on the front of the wrist, and is then continued upwards on the inner side of the forearm as far as the elbow, where it is joined by the posterior ulnar vein to form the basilic (p. 273). The veins on the back of the hand commence at the extremi- ties of the fingers, run up between the knuckles, and unite on the back of the hand, forming an arch, with its concavity upwards. The posterior ulnar vein arises from this arch by a branch (vena salvatella) situated over the fourth interosseous space, and runs up on the back of the forearm towards the inner condyle, to join the anterior ulnar vein. The radial vein, situated on the outer side of the forearm,

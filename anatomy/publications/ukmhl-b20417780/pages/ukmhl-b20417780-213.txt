199 DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. M. Thteo- This muscle arises from the angle of the abttenoideus. thyroid cartilage and the crico-thyroid membrane, runs horizontally backwards, and is inserted into the base and anterior border of the arytenoid. Its fibres run parallel with the vocal cord, and some of them are directly inserted into it. Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal. This muscle relaxes the vocal cord. More than this, it puts the lip of the glottis in the vocalising position ; in this position, the margins of the glottis are parallel, and the chink is reduced to the breadth of a shilling.

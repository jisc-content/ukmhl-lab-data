103 INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. ing to the branches of the artery. As the vein lies between the Pterygoid temporal and external pterygoid muscles it forms Plexus of Veins. a plexus—pterygoid plexus—which communi- cates, above, with the cavernous sinus by branches which come through the foramina at the base of the skull; in front it communi- cates with the facial vein. It joins the temporal in the substance of the parotid gland, and thus communicates with the external jugular vein. Inferior Max- This great nerve is the largest of the three illart Nerve divisions of the fifth cerebral nerve. It differs and Branches. from the other two divisions, i.e. the ophthalmic and the superior maxillary, in that it contains motor as well as sensory filaments ; the motor being furnished by the small non- ganglionic root of the fifth nerve. It is necessary to remember this point of its physiology, in order to understand its extensive dis- tribution ; for the sensory portion supplies the parts to which it is distributed with common sensation only, whilst the motor portion supplies all the muscles concerned in mastication. The nerve, then, composed of sensory and motor filaments, emerges from the skull through the foramen ovale as a thick trunk, under the name of the inferior maxillary. It lies directly external to the Eustachian tube, and is covered by the external pterygoid muscle, which must be turned on one side to expose it. Immediately after its exit from the skull, the nerve divides into two parts, an anterior, or motor division, and a posterior or sen- sory division. From the anterior portion (chiefly motor) are derived branches distributed to the muscles of mastication. From the posterior (mainly sensory) come the following branches: the auriculotemporal, gustatory, inferior dental and buccal; there are also motor branches to the mylo-hyoid and anterior belly of the digastricus. This apparent anomaly will be presently explained.

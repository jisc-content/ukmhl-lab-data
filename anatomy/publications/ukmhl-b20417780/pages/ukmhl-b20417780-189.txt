175 STRUCTURE OP THE LUNGS. Fig. 32. air-cells or alveoli, which vary from ^ to of an inch in diameter (fig. 32). The air-cells themselves present a number of shallow depressions, separated by somewhat prominent parti- tions, so that their interior has a honey- combed appearance, as shown in fig. 32. The purpose of these is to increase the extent of surface upon which the capillaries may ramify. The structure of the minute air-cell of the human lung is in all respects similar to the large respiratory sac of the reptile. The structure of the air-cells differs in some important features from that of the small bronchial tubes; the muscular tissue disappears, the elastic tissue is no longer arranged in bundles, but becomes frayed out and inter- mingled with the connective tissue, and the ciliated epithelium is replaced UL™IATE f<™ OT the lung - . i 1 _ ...

Their ultimate ramifica- tions spread out in such profusion beneath the epithelium of the air-cells, that a well-injected lung appears a mass of the finest network of capillaries. This network is single and is so close that the interstices are even narrower than the vessels, which are on an average about 3 *0 0 of an inch in diameter. The blood and air are not in actual contact. Nothing, however, intervenes but the wall of the cell and the capillary vessels, which are such delicate structures that they oppose no obstacle to the free interchange of gases by which the blood is purified. This purification is effected by the taking in of oxygen, and the elimination of carbonic acid and watery vapour. The most complete purification takes place in the single layer of capillaries between the folds of membrane projecting into the cell; for in this situation both sides of these

414 DISSECTION OF THE MALE PEEINEUM. rises. If tbe bladder be distended half-way up to the umbilicus, which is commonly the case when it has to be tapped, we find that the bottom of the pouch would be about two inches from the symphysis pubis (fig. 87). Within this distance from the symphysis, the bladder may be tapped in the linea alba, with- out risk of wounding the peritoneum. Thus, - the surgeon has the choice of two situations in which he may tap tbe bladder â€”above the pubes, or from the rectum. Which of the two be the more appropriate, must be decided by the circumstances of the case. DISSECTION OF THE MALE PERINEUM. Fig. Before dissecting the perineum, it is expedient first to ex- amine the osseous and ligamentous boundaries of the lower aper- ture of the pelvis. Looking at the male pelvis (with the ligaments preserved), we observe that this aperture is of a lozenge shapej that it is bounded in front by the symphysis of the pubes, laterally by the rami of the pubes and ischium ; behind, by the coccyx and the great saero-ischiatic ligaments. This space, for convenience of de- scription, is divided into two by a line diagram of the framework drawn from one tuber ischii to the other. The anterior forms a nearly equilateral triangle, of which the sides are from three to three and a-half inches long; and since it transmits the urethra, it is called the urethral division of the perineum. The posterior, containing the anus, is called the anal division (fig. 88, 2).* The subject should be placed in the usual position for lithotomy, with a full-sized staff in the bladder, the rectum moderately dis- tended with tow, and the scrotum raised by means of hooks. A * The dimensions of the lower outlet of the pelvis are apt to vary in different subjects, and the lithotomist must modify his incisions accordingly.

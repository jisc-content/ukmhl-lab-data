631 DISSECTION OF THE EYE. Since the eye in the human subject cannot be obtained suf- ficiently fresh for anatomical purposes, the student should examine the eye of the sheep, bullock, or pig. The conjunctiva membrana should be removed, together with the loose connective tissue which unites it to the sclerotica. n The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane which Conjunctiva. — »> covers the ocular surface of the eyelids and the anterior part of the globe, and is lined with columnar epithelium. It is loosely attached to the sclerotic coat, so as not to impede the movements of the globe. The palpebral portion of it is very vascular., and provided with fine papillae abundantly sup- plied with nerves.* It is continued into the Meibomian glands, the puncta lachrymalia, and the ducts of the lachrymal gland. The sclerotic portion is thinner and has no papilla?. It is trans- parent and nearly colourless, except when inflamed; it then becomes intensely vascular, and of a bright scarlet colour. An abundant supply of nerves is distributed to the membrane ; their arrangement is stated to be the same as that of the skin, but many of them have been described as terminating in end-bulbs. The corneal conjunctiva is composed chiefly of epithelium. arranged in layers. This portion of the conjunctiva cannot be separated by dissection in recent eyes, but it possesses the same acute sensibility as the rest of the conjunctiva. Changes produced by inflammation of the conjunctiva often involve the cornea and render its texture thick and opaque.| Blood-vessels ramify * These papillae were first described by Eble, ' Ueber den Bau und die Krank- heiten der Bindehaut des Auges.' f The facts of comparative anatomy confirm this view.

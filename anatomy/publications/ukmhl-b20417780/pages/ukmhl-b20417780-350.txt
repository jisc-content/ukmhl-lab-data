336 INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. transverse metacarpal ligament. On the back of the hand the interosseous muscles are covered by a thin fascia, which is attached to the adjacent borders of the metacarpal bones. Transverse This consists of strong bands of ligamentous Metacarpal fibres, which pass transversely between the distal Ligament. extremities of the metacarpal bones. These bands are intimately united to the fibro-cartilaginous ligament of the metacarpal joints, and are of sufficient length to admit of a certain degree of movement between the ends of the metacarpal bones.

Dissection. Eemove the fascia which covers the interosseous muscles, and separate the metacarpal bones by dividing the transverse metacarpal ligament. A bursa is fre- quently developed between their digital extremities. Interosseous These muscles, so named from their position, Muscles. extend from the sides of the metacarpal bones to the bases of the first phalanges and the extensor tendons of the fingers. In each interosseous space (except the first, in which there is only an abductor) there are- two muscles, one of which

LUMBAR PLEXUS. 410 arch divides into the genital branch (g), which runs along the inguinal canal, on the under aspect of the spermatic cord, and supplies the cremaster ; and the crural (e), which proceeds under the crural arch, and is lost in the skin of the upper part of the thigh, where it communicates with the middle cutaneous nerve. c. The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is generally derived from the second lumbar. It runs through the psoas, then, crossing obliquely over the iliacus towards the spine of the ilium, passes beneath the crural arch, and is finally distributed to the skin on the outside of the thigh. If the external cutaneous be not found in its usual situation, look for it as a distinct branch of the anterior crural, nearer the psoas muscle. d. The anterior crural (d), the largest and most important branch, is formed by the union of the third and fourth lumbar nerves, sometimes receiving a small branch from the second. It descends in a groove between the psoas and the iliacus behind the fascia iliaca, supplies both these muscles, and then, passing under the crural arch to the outer side of the femoral artery, is finally distributed to the extensor muscles of the knee, to the sartorius and pectineus, and the skin of the thigh and leg. e. The obturator nerve (/) is next in size to the anterior crural. It proceeds from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, descends behind the psoas muscle, and then, getting to its inner border it runs along the brim of the pelvis to^the obturator foramen, through the upper part of which it passes to the adductor muscles of the thigh. /. The accessory obturator nerve, by no means a constant branch, is derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends over the horizontal ramus of the pubes, supplies the pec- tineus and gives off a small branch to the hip joint. Postponing the minute anatomy of the abdominal viscera, begin the examination of the contents of the pelvis.

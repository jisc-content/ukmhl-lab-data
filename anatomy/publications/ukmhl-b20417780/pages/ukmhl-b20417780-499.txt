485 STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY. from eight to twelve cup-like excavations, called the calyces. Into each of these calyces one, sometimes two or more papilla? project. Between the calyces the branches of the renal artery ascend to ramify in the kidney, lying embedded in fat. With a lens, the papillae may be seen studded with minute apertures, which are Fig. 111. 1.

These tubes as they pass outwards run straight, bifurcate repeatedly at very acute angles, and reach the sides and the bases of the pyramids. They then enter the cortex in bundles of straight tubes, forming the 'pyramids of Ferrein. They vary from the 3-^-th to the yÂ£0th of

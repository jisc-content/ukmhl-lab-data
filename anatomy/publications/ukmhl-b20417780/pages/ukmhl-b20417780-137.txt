123 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. occupied by the heart and large vessels takes the name of the middle mediastinum. Looking at the chest in front, the anterior mediastinum ap- pears as shown in the diagram (p. 125). It is not precisely ver- tical in its direction, for it inclines slightly towards the left, owing to the position of the heart. Its area varies : thus it is extremely narrow in the middle where the edges of the lungs nearly meet; but it is wider above and below, where the lungs diverge. Poste- riorly it is limited by the pericardium covering the heart, aorta and its branches, and the pulmonary artery. What parts are contained in the anterior mediastinum ?â€”The^N remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, I sterno-thyroid, and triangularis sterni muscles, the left brachio- f cephalic vein (which crosses behind the first bone of the sternum) I a few lymphatic glands, and the left internal mammary artery andy I'm. 20.

AT The skin on the back of the hand is united to Nerves on the Back of the the subjacent tendons by an abundance of loose Hand and connective tissue, in which are large veins, and Fingers. branches of the radial and ulnar nerves. The dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, over the internal lateral ligament of the wrist, and divides upon the back of the hand into filaments, which supply both sides of the back of the little finger, the ring finger, and the ulnar side of the middle finger. The radial nerve passes obliquely beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and subdivides into filaments, which supply both sides of the back of the thumb and forefinger, and the radial side of the middle finger.* The radial nerve commonly gives off, on the back of the hand, a branch which joins the nearest branch of the ulnar. Fascia on back The fascia on the back of the forearm is com- of Forearm. posed of fibres interlacing and stronger than that upon the front of the forearm. It is attached to the condyles of the humerus and to the olecranon, and is strengthened by an ex- pansion from the tendon of the triceps. Along the forearm it is attached to the ridge on the posterior part of the ulna. Its upper third gives origin to the fibres of the muscles beneath it, and divides them by septa, to which their fibres are also attached. Posterior This ligament should be considered as a part of Annular Liga- the fascia of the forearm, specially strengthened MENT- by oblique aponeurotic fibres on the back of the wrist, to confine the extensor tendons. These fibres are attached * The relative share which the radial and ulnar nerves take in supplying the fingers varies. Under any arrangement the thumb and each finger has two dorsal nerves, one on either side, of which the terminal branches reach the root of the nail. They supply filaments to the skin on the back of the finger, and have frequent com- munications with the palmar digital nerves. In some instances, one or more of the dorsal nerves do not extend beyond the first phalanx; their place is then supplied by a branch from the palmar nerve.

69 BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic. It runs over the necks of the first and second ribs, and furnishes the arteries of the two upper intercostal spaces, and a posterior branch which is distributed to the muscles of the back and the spinal cord. It usually inoscu- lates with the first inter- Fig. 12. costal branch of the aorta. The corresponding vein terminates on the right side in the vena azygos ; on the left in the brachio- cephalic. Deep Cervical This artery Artery. arises from the superior intercostal, seldom direct from the subclavian. It goes to the back of the neck between the first rib and the trans- verse process of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends between the com- plexus and the semi-spinalis colli, both of which it sup- plies. It sometimes inos- culates with the princeps cervicis, a branch of the occipital (p. 55). To test your knowledge of the branches of the sub- clavian artery, reflect upon the answer to the follow- ing question : If the ar- tery were tied in the first part of its course before it gives off any branches, how would the arm be supplied with blood ? The answer is, by six collateral channels, as follow: 1. By the com- munications between the superior and inferior thyroid : 2. Between DIAGRAM TO SHOW THE INOSCULATIONS OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY.

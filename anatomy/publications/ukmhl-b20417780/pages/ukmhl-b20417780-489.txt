475 STRUCTURE OF THE LIVER. Graafian vesicles* They vary in number from eight to thirty, and in size from that of a pin's head to a pea.f The smallest are near the centre; but as they advance towards maturity, they gradually approach the surface, increasing at the same time in size. Their proper tunic is very vascular and lined by several layers of granular prismatic epithelium cells, called the tunica granulosa, and they contain a transparent albuminous fluid. On examining the contents of one of the larger vesicles under the microscope, you find in it the ovum or germ,| surrounded by a layer of granular cells called the discus proligerus. It is this ovum which, escaping from the Graafian vesicle on the surface of the ovary, is grasped by the fimbriated end of the Fallopian tube and con- veyed into the uterus. The ruptured vesicle is converted soon afterwards into a yellowish-looking mass called corpus luteum, which persists for a while, and degenerates afterwards into a small stellate fibrous cicatrix. The ramifications of the ovarian artery through the ovary are remarkable for their convolutions : they run in parallel lines, as in the testicle. Its nerves are derived from the ovarian plexus. The ovarian veins form, like the spermatic veins, near the ovary the pampiniform plexus, and then terminate, the right in the inferior vena cava, the left in the renal. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. T ^ The liver is the largest gland in the body, and in the adult weighs from fifty to sixty ounces. Its surface is entirely covered by peritoneum, except a small part behind, which is connected to the diaphragm and the upper part of the right kidney by cellular tissue, and, again, in the hollow for * So called after De Graaf, a Dutch anatomist, who discovered them in 1672, and believed they were the true ova. f From the j^th to the ^th of an inch in diameter.

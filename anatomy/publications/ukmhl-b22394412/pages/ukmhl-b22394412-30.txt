30 FIFTH DAY’S SALK' [Duty to be paid by the Purchaier,'] LOT 10 A large extirpated steatomatous tumor. 11 Ditto, much larger, from the back of the neck. 12 An interesting specimen of bisected morbid knee-joint from an amputated limb. 13 A foot from a limb amputated in consequence of mortification of the toes. That interesting line of demarcation formed by the absorption of the sane from the morbid parts, so decidedly pointing out the time after which an operation may with propriety be performed, is admirably seen in this pre- paration, in consequence of the foot being minutely injected. The ope- ration was performed and the limb presented by Wm. Lynn, Esq. 14 A foot from a limb amputated in consequence of caries of the tarsus. 15 An unusually large and morbid congregation of lymphatic glands surrounding the whole of the cervical organs, part of the heart and sinus aortas, com- pressing and obstructing the cesophagus, so as wholly to prevent degluti- tion, and thus occasion death by starvation. 16 A foot from a limb amputated by Mr. Pott for caries of the tarsus. 17 A carious elbow-joint laid open, from an amputated limb. 18 An unusually fine specimen of morbid knee-joint, the interior of which is exposed to view, showing a high degree of unsubdued inflammation, for which the limb was amputated by Thomas Copeland, Esq. and presented by that gentleman to Mr. Brookes. 19 A most extraordinary and perfectly unique case of sloughing of a very con- siderable portion of the psoas magnus muscle ; from a private patient of Mr. Uppom’s, attended also by Mr. Brookes.—N.B. The patient re- covered. 20 A large steatomatous tumor; extirpated from the upper part of the back by Thomas Wheateley, Esq.

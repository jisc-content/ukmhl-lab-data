85 ALBINO. of the Africans generally* It has been like- wise supposed that Celsus alluded to the Al- bino, when he speaks of a peculiar condition of the skin under the name of Leuce ;f but this appears to be a morbid cutaneous affection, and to have no reference to the subject now under consideration. From the number of Albinoes which were supposed to exist in certain countries, as well as from the marked peculiarity in their ap- pearance, an opinion was long entertained that they formed a distinct race or variety of the human species,J originating in some unknown cause, and bearing the same relation to the other inhabitants of the countries in which they are found that the acknowledged varieties of the human species bear to each other. But this opinion, although sanctioned by high authority, may be considered as decisively disproved by the well-ascertained fact, that Albinoes are born of parents who do not possess this characteristic peculiarity of the skin, hair, and eyes.§ Although Albinoes are of comparatively rave occurrence in Europe, yet we have had a suffi- cient number of examples to render us per- fectly familiar with the appearance which they present, and with the precise nature of the * See the note of Hardouin in loco, Valpy's ed. p. 1285, Le Maire's, t. ii. p. 438 ; also the remark of M. Marcus in M. Ajasson's Trans, of Pliny, t. iv. p. 185. It is, perhaps, to this lighter coloured negro, rather than to the proper Albino, that we must refer, in part at least, the accounts which are given by travellers of the great number of white Africans that have been collected in certain situa- tions. We may remark that all accounts of Albi- noes that are given in general terms only, should be received with a certain degree of caution, unless the peculiar state of the eye is distinctly noticed.

Voltaire main- tains this hypothesis, Essai sur les mceurs, CEuvr. t. xiii. Introd. and p. 7, 8. Bnffon inclines to it; but his opinion on this point is not decided or uniform, t. iii. p. 501. See Is. St. Hilaire, p. 295. § In addition to the authors already referred to, we have a case of this kind by Helvetius, Hist. Acad. Sc. 1734, p. 15 . . 7. The Albiness described by Buffon was born of black parents: see also Castillon, in Berlin Mem. 1762, p. 99 . . 105 ; Dic- quemarc, Journ. Phys. 1777, p. 357 . . 0, and 1788, p. 301 et seq. ; Hist.

We have a decisive proof that the peculiarity of the'Albino is merely accidental and individual, and does not constitute a distinct variety, in the state of the offspring of an Albino and a black negro, which is not intermediate between the two, as in the case of the Mulatto; Hunter, on the Anim.

We are informed that the skin of the African and American Albino is not only completely free from any shade of brown or olive, but that it is also devoid of the pink tinge which is found more or less in the complexion of the European. It would appear, likewise, that the skin of the tropical Albino is frequently in a diseased state, being covered with scales of a leprous nature, and with a serous exudation, which proceeds from the fissures or clefts that take place in various parts of the surface.J It has been a very general opinion, that be- sides the peculiar state of the integuments, the Albino possesses a general delicacy of habit and constitution, and that he exhibits a defici- ency even of mental power.§ For this latter opinion there appears to be no sufficient foun- dation, and with respect to the former we may remark, that any general weakness of the phy- sical frame, if it be actually found to exist, may be probably referred, at least in some degree, to the peculiar condition of the eyes and the skin, which are not well adapted either to a * We have a copious list of references in Blu- menbach, p. 278 . . 0, in Lawrence, p. 281 . . 9, and in Is. St. Hilaire, ut supra and §. 5. One of the earliest of what may be considered as the correct descriptions is that of Buffon, Supp. t. iv. p. 559 et seq. The descriptions of Blumenbach, S. 78, and of Saussurc, Voy. §. 1037 . . . 1043, are par- ticularly correct and characteristic : to this we may add the more recent account of Is. St. Hilaire, t. i. par. 2, liv. 3. ch. 1, §. 2 and 5. We are informed by Ludolf, ubi supra, that the first modern writer who distinctly mentions the Albino is Tellez. t Blumenbach particularly characterizes the whiteness of the hair of the Albino as being " gilva, colori cremoris lactis quodammodo comparanda," p. 275.

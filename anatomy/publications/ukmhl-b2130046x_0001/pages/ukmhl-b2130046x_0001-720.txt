CONCHIFERA. 696 Fig. 345. (a, fig. 346) placed at Fig. 346. the anterior part of the animal is deeply hid- den between the foot (6, Jig. 346), and the anterior retractor mus- cle (c) in the Dimyaria, and under a kind of cowl formed by the mantle in the Mono- myaria. The mouth is in the form of a trans- verse slit, comprised between two lips, ge- nerally thin and nar- row, as in almost all the Dimyaria, or lo- bated and digitated, as in some of the Monomyaria, (a, Jig. 348). The hps ex- tend on either side in the form of two flat- tened smaller appendages, more or less elon- gated, occasionally truncated, streaked or laminated on their internal surface, and to which the title of labial palps has by general consent been given, (d, Jig. 346, c,Jg. 348.) The mouth in the Conchifera never presents any part that is hard. In the greater number of these animals it terminates without any intermediate passage in a stomach, the form of which is subject to but little variety. When there is an oesophagus (a, Jig. 347), it is variable both in point of length and capacity; it has nothing constant, relatively to the other distinctive characters of the groups established among the conchifera generally : thus it either occurs or is wanting indifferently among the individual members of the dimyarian and mo- nomyarian families. Fig. 347. The stomach (b, Jig. 347, d,Jig. 348) is a membranous pouch, commonly pear-shaped,

Of the organs of respiration.â€” The whole of the Conchiferous mollusks respire by means of branchrae (e, e,Jig. 346). These or- gans are variously disposed according to the form of the animal. They are symmetrical; and in almost all the genera there are two on each side. The branchiae generally present the form of membranous leaflets, of a qua- drangular shape, though often unequal. They are broad and short when the animal is glo- bular, elongated and narrow when the animal is lengthened in its general form. In the greater number of genera the branchiae are formed of two membranous layers or lamina? (a, b, Jig. 352) within the substance of which the branchial vessels descend with great regu- larity. In several genera, as the Archidae and Pecten, the branchial vessels, instead of being connected parallel to one another within the thickness of a common membrane, continue unconnected through their entire length, and they are thus formed of a great number of extremely delicate filaments attached by the base within a membranous pedicle, in which the branchial veins pursue their way towards Fig. 352. the auricle. In a great many families and genera the branchiae of one side have no com- munication with those of the opposite side ; in some others however, as in the genus Unio, the four branchial laminaa meet under the foot, and the whole of their vessels empty them- selves into a venous sinus of considerable size. 2 z 2

185 ANUS. applied, and by attention to posture. In the procidentia of old persons, Mr. Hey conceives that the relaxed state of the lower part of the intestine and of its surrounding cellular tissue, are in fault, and that hence the folds or ex- crescences about the anus remain, even when the parts have been returned ; he therefore sug- gests the removal of these flaps from the cir- cumference of the opening, and relates some well-marked cases in support of this practice, in which the operation had been successfully performed. The margin of the anus, like that of the mouth, is subject to fissures, chaps, and super- ficial excoriations, sometimes caused by lace- ration induced by the passage of large and hardened faeces, but sometimes arising spon- taneously, and sometimes connected with a pecul.arly irritable and contractile condition of the sphincter ani. This disease must not be confounded with haemorrhoids; on examin- ation it is not easily seen, but little is appa- rent, the anus is much contracted, the orifice somewhat redder than natural, slightly tender on pressure, but exquisitely so on dilating it by introducing the finger; this must be done cautiously and slowly, a cleft will then be observed just where the skin and mucous membrane join, generally on one side extending a little way, from half an inch to an inch and a half, longitudinally up the intestine; on di- lating the part still more, the surface of the fissure will be seen slightly ulcerated, and when touched it is exquisitely painful; the surrounding muscle is in a state of rigid con- traction. It is doubtful whether the contrac- tion is the cause of the fissure, or whether the latter is the cause of the irritable and con- tracted condition of the muscle. Both expla- nations maybe occasionally correct; but it is most probable that the irritable state of the muscle induces the ulcerated fissure, inasmuch as this muscular contraction occasionally exists without any fissure, and is then equally pain- ful; and fissures frequently exist, as in syphilis, without inducing any spasmodic constriction of the muscle, and accordingly are attended with little or no pain. Contraction of the anus also frequently ex- ists without any fissure; sometimes it is con- genital, sometimes it appears in the adult; the pam and other symptoms are nearly analogous, and as severe as in the case of fissure; the examination by the finger however does not detect one part to be more painful than another, as is the case in that disease; and this is almost the only symptom distinguishing these two affections. The term hemorrhoid has been applied by writers, practitioners, and invalids to any con- dition of the rectum and anus in which a discharge of blood takes place. It is, how- ever, more correctly applied to the small tu- mours which are frequently seen at and very close to the inner border of the anus or even occupying the very aperture, also to somewhat similar productions situated within the rectum, at the distance of one, two, or even three inches above the anus. From such tumours occupying these different positions, they have been arranged by all writers into external and internal haemorrhoids; the latter are very im- portant and demand the close attention of the surgeon, both as to their pathology and sym- ptoms, as being frequently obscure and liable to be mistaken not merely for the ordinary diseases of the anus, such as fissure, blind internal fistula, &c, but also to be confounded with a varicose condition of the veins of the rectum, which is by no means an uncommon condition, or with those vascular tumours which are productions of the mucous mem- brane occasionally protruding at the anus, that have been already noticed, and are of a wholly different character from true he- morrhoidal tumours, or with the protrusions of the mucous membrane itself, the effect of the relaxation of its cellular connections. As the full consideration of this important branch of pathology belongs to the article on the mor- bid anatomy of the rectum, we shall here con- fine ourselves to a few observations on external haemorrhoids and analogous tumours. External hemorrhoids appear at the border of the anus as small bluish tumours, the colour however varying according to the con- dition of the tumours, being sometimes of a dark and deep red or black, at others pale and almost white; in size they vary from a grain of small shot to a large cherry ; they are some- times full and almost bursting, at others they are soft like a flaccid nipple, empty or with- ered ; they are covered on the anal side by the delicate cuticle which is smooth and glossy, and on the outer side by the common integu- ment; when small, they are moveable and can be distinctly felt to be in the subcutaneous cellular tissue; when large and tense, they ap- pear more connected with the skin itself; an attentive examination can always distinguish between these and the several excrescences, vegetations, or condylomata, which have been already mentioned as the effects of syphilis, as also the folds or crests of integument and mucous membrane which are found so fre- quently prolonged from the border of the anus. These tumours remain in many persons for years free from pain, and productive of little, if of any, inconvenience; occasionally, however, and periodically in some, they en- large, inflame, and interfere with the functions of the anus, and by sympathy engage the ad- jacent organs, and are relieved either by a copious discharge of blood, or by suppuration, or by the interference of art. The liability of the veins immediately about the anus to varicose enlargement appears in some measure founded in anatomical structure. If we inject the intestinal veins in the adult with wax injection, we shall often find a little above the anus, just where the skin and mu- cous membrane unite, a sort of constriction on the vessels ; the veins appear larger imme- diately above it, and again below it, and many of the branches in" the venous plexus around the anus appear to be enlarged, while in the very spot or circular line alluded to, the vessels appear to be compressed.

594 CHEIROPTERA. suck would appear to be very inconvenient for respiration, as either the mother or young one will be prevented from breathing at the time, their nostrils being in opposite directions, there- fore the nose of one must be under water, and the time of sucking can only be between each respiration. The act of sucking must likewise be different from that of land animals; as in them it is performed by the lungs drawing the air from the mouth backwards into themselves, which the fluid follows, by being forced into the mouth from the pressure of the external air on its surface; but in this tribe, the lungs having no connexion with the mouth, sucking must be performed by some action of the mouth itself, and by its having the power of expansion." Much stress has recently been laid on the supposed existence which the muscles sur- rounding the mammary gland afford in the act of suckling by compressing the gland and ejaculating the milk accumulated in the dilated receptacle above described ; but when we con- sider how great the pressure of the surrounding water must be upon the extended surface of the mammary gland, we may readily conceive that when the nipple is grasped by the mouth of the young, and the pressure removed from it by the retraction of the tongue, the milk will be expelled in a copious stream by means of the surrounding pressure alone, independently of muscular aid. The intimate structure of the mammary gland in the Zoophagous Cetacea is essentially the same as in the Ornithorhynchus, being compo- sed of an innumerable quantity of small elon- gated crecal tubes; these are, however, shorter than in the Ornithorhynchus, and their glandu- lar parietes are firmer; they are well shown in the figure of the mammary gland of a young Piked Whale, (Bulauoptera Rostrata,J given by Muller in his pi. xvii. Jig. 2, and according to that author present, after the Ornithorhyn- chus, the simplest structure of the mammary gland in the entire mammiferous series of ani- mals.] BIBLIOGRAPHY.—Aristotle, Historia de animali- bus.

The question whether this group, as well as that of the Carnivora and that of the In- sectivora, ought to be considered as forming a single order according to the method of Cuvier, has been already sufficiently adverted to under the head Carnivora; and it needs only to be now observed that if there were sufficient ground for giving to the last-men- tioned group a separate consideration, either on account of expediency and convenience, or on that of natural arrangement, the same

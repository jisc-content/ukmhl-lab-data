In the cold-blooded Vertebrat i the com- ponent parts of these bones generally remain separated throughout life, giving an appear- ance of great complexity to the skull, and occa- sioning much difficulty in tracing their cor- respondence with the cranial bones of the higher classes. Equal difficulty is experi- enced in determining the component parts of the head in Birds, but from a very different cause. In the cold-blooded Crocodile, and Fish, this difficulty is caused by the tardiness of ossification, which prevents the coalition of the several elements of the cranial bones into their determinate groups; while, in Birds, the Fig. 126.

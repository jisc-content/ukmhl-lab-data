366 AZYGOS. arteries ; they commence each by the union of small branches near the sternum, which anas- tomose with the internal mammary veins : they then accompany the intercostal arteries along the groove in the lower border of each rib; near the spine they increase in size, being joined by several veins from the exterior mus- cles of the spine, which pass through the internal part of each intercostal space along with the posterior branches of the intercostal arteries ; in this situation also they receive veins from the vertebral canal, communicating with the vertebral sinuses on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebra?, and passing through the intervertebral holes along with the spinal nerves. All the intercostal veins com- municate with each other over the heads of the ribs, either by many small or by a few larger branches; the veins of the opposite sides also communicate by transverse branches, so as to give to the anterior surface of the dorsal ver- tebrae, in a successful injection of the venous system, an appearance somewhat analogous to the vertebral sinuses on their posterior sur- face. The first intercostal vein of the right side generally ascends over the neck of the first rib, and over the first dorsal ganglion of the sympathetic nerve, and joins the subclavian vein or some of its deep cervical branches; the second intercostal frequently joins the first, and sometimes the third also terminates in a similar manner, but usually the fourth, third, and often the second open into the arch of the azygos by one or two branches: these superior intercostal veins always communicate with each other and with the azygos below, as well as with the subclavian above. The remaining intercostal veins of the right side enter the azygos separately, or two or three occasionally unite and end by a common opening; the infe- rior ascend, the middle take a transverse course, and the superior descend ; near the spine they all anastomose freely with each other, so that the heads of the ribs support a chain or net- work of these vascular inosculations, as is well represented in Breschet's plates of the venous system. The superior intercostal vein of the left side always joins the left subclavian or some of its large branches, the internal mammary in parti- cular; it is usually a large vein, but it presents great varieties; in some it appears as a third vena azygos, and might be named the left superior azygos; in such cases it communicates below with the inferior azygos about the sixth dorsal vertebra and above with the left subcla- vian ; in the intermediate space it receives the corresponding intercostal veins, also the oeso- phageal, mediastinal, and left bronchial; this vein sometimes also communicates directly with the right azygos. The remaining left intercostal veins enter the lesser azygos, or if this vessel be absent, they cross the spine behind the oesophagus, aorta, and thoracic duct, and enter the great azygos separately, or two or three conjoined. The superior and in- ferior azygos veins of the left side are some- times continuous, and enter the left subclavian, thus taking a parallel and very similar course to the vein on the right side, particularly when the latter opens so high as into either of the vena? innominatae. The bronchial veins arise in the cellular tissue of the lungs from the extremities of the bron- chial arteries; as the branches unite into larger vessels, these are found to accompany very closely the divisions of the bronchial tube ; they leave the root of each lung two or three in number; on the right side one joins the arch of the azygos or the superior vena cava, the others open into the azygos lower down, or into some of the mediastinal or intercostal branches. The left bronchial veins arise in a similar manner, escape from the root of the left lung, and open either into some of the superior in- tercostal veins, or into the superior or inferior azygos minor. In minute injections of the lungs these veins are found to inosculate with the capillary terminations of the pulmonary arteries. Both the right and left vena azygos receive numerous branches from the posterior mediastinum, from - the coats of the aorta, pericardium, oesophagus, bronchial glands, trachea, &c. &c; these veins pursue no regular course; they receive names either from the arteries they accompany, or from the organs whence they are derived; they require no par- ticular description. The vena azygos is the principal vein apper- taining to the parietes of the chest; it not only serves to receive the several branches which have been mentioned, but also maintains numerous communications between different portions of the venous system, which must prove of essential service in case of obstruction to the circulation in any of the principal trunks : thus, its abdominal portion communi- cates either directly with the inferior vena cava, or indirectly through the medium of the lumbar, phrenic, renal, or spermatic veins, while its thoracic end joins the superior cava, and at the same time anastomoses on either side with the subclavian vein or some of its branches. On both sides of the thorax again it inoscu- lates by its intercostal communications not only with the internal mammary, but also with the thoracic branches of the axillary veins, and along the vertebrae it communicates with the vertebral sinuses, opposite each foramen of conjunction. This vein, consequently, ap- pears not only as one of the roots of the cava, but also as a loop or second channel between the two cavae, which, in case of the obstruction of either, more particularly of the inferior, would convey the blood to the heart, and thus obviate any impediment to the venous circulation of the lower segment of the body. Cases have even occurred in which the inferior cava has been obstructed or nearly obliterated by the pressure of a tumour or of a diseased liver, and in these this anastomosis, and indeed the whole vena azygos have been found greatly increased in size. The vena azygos appears moreover to have been formed as a convenient means for receiving numerous venous branches which could not reach any of the large vessels

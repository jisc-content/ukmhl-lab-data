CAROTID ARTERY. 483 opinion they have been also called urtcr'ue soporiferte. The carotid arteries consist of—1 st, the pri- mitive carotids, of which the right arises from the arteria innominata, while the left comes directly from the arch of the aorta; 2d, the ex- ternal carotid ; and. 3d, the internal carotid : these last two vessels on each side being pro- duced by the bifurcation of the primitive ca- rotid. Both primitive carotids are of equal size according to Bichat, Boyer, and Cloquet; nei- ther Meckel nor Tiedemann make any remark as to a difference in their size, while, according to Soemmerring, the right is one-twenty-fifth larger than the left in the majority of in- stances. The origin of the right carotid from the arteria innominata is opposite the right sterno- clavicular articulation. The left carotid arises from the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta behind the first bone of the sternum, on a plane with the centre of the junction of the cartilages of the first pair of ribs with that bone in front, and corresponding with the superior edge of the second thoracic vertebra posteriorly; owing to this difference in their origins, the left primitive carotid is from one inch to one inch and a quarter longer than the right, and is con- tained within the thorax in the commencement of its course; it may therefore be divided into a thoracic and a cervical portion. The thoracic portion of the left primitive carotid, by which I mean that portion which extends from the origin of the artery to a point on a level with the sterno-clavicular articulation, has the following relations :—anteriorly it is covered by the left vena innominata, the remains of the thymus gland, some loose cellular tissue, and occasionally a few lymphatic glands; in front of these the origins of the sterno-thyroid and sterno-hyoid muscles separate it from the sternum ; posteriorly it rests on the oesophagus, left recurrent nerve, the origin of the left sub- clavian artery, the left par vagum, the thoracic duct, and some loose cellular tissue, in addition to which the longus colli is interposed between it and the front of the spinal column ; on its right side it is bounded by the trachea, and on its left by the phrenic nerve and the mediasti- nal portion of the left pleura, which gives a loose covering to a small portion of its surface, against which the internal side of the apex of the left lung is applied. The right primitive carotid and the cervical portion of the left are of equal length, and have similar relations: at first, in the lower part of the neck these vessels of opposite sides are only separated by the breadth of the trachea : as they ascend, however, they diverge from each other, and are separated by the larynx and thyroid body : in their ascent they seem to pass backwards, owing to the prominence of the larynx forwards, but in reality they cannot re- cede, as they are closely applied to the front of the spinal column; they are not contorted in their course, nor do they furnish any branch until they arrive as high as the superior margin of the larynx, where each bifurcates by dividing into the external and the internal carotids. Relations of the trunk of the Primitive Carotid.—Anteriorly the primitive carotid is covered by the three following layers of mus- cles from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the level of the cricoid cartilage; 1st, the pla- tysma myoides, beneath which lies the superfi- cial layer of the cervical fascia; 2d, the sternal portion of the sterno-cleido-mastoid ; and 3d, by the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and the omo-hyoid, which latter muscle crosses the sheath of the artery, having its internal edge connected with the outer edge of the sterno- thyroid by a dense fascia, a part of the deep layer of the cervical fascia, which is firmly con- nected to the posterior margin of the clavicle inferiorly: between the lower part of the sterno- mastoid and the front of the artery there is an interval of about an inch on the left side, and something less on the right, in consequence of the origin of the right carotid being so much more anterior on that side; this interval is filled by cellular and adipose tissue, some large veins, one or more of the sub-clavicular branches of the cervical plexus, and occasionally a few lymphatic glands; at the level of the cricoid cartilage the sterno-mastoid passes backward, and the omo-hyoid coming from beneath, it passes forwards to its insertion into the os hyoides. Above the crossing of these two muscles the carotid has no muscular covering, except the platysma, from which it is separated by cellular membrane, several veins from the thyroid body and larynx, and some lymphatic glands; the nervus descendens noni also lies in front of the primitive carotid at its upper por- tion, being found sometimes within, sometimes outside, and occasionally embedded in the sub- stance of the wall of its sheath; the thyroid body also generally overlaps the carotid by its outer edge. Posteriorly the carotid is bounded by the longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major, which separate it from the anterior surface of the spinal column; the cervical cord of the sympathetic nerve and its superior and middle cardiac branches are closely connected to the posterior part of its sheath; the vertebral artery and vein are behind it at its lower part; and higher up it crosses the inferior thyroid artery at a point corresponding to that at which it is covered in front by the omo-hvoideus ; some- times the inferior thyroid crosses over the ca- rotid : the arteria cervical is ascendens often lies behind the carotid towards the upper part of the neck ; moreover, the recurrent nerve on the right side, in its course from behind the sub- clavian artery to the side of the trachea, passes behind the origin of the right carotid. From the relations of the primitive carotid posteriorly, it is evident that it can be most effectually compressed against the front of the spinal co- lumn, but to continue such pressure for any length of time would obviously be followed by injurious effects, from the lesion to which the nerves behind the sheath of the vessel would be thus subjected. 2 i 2

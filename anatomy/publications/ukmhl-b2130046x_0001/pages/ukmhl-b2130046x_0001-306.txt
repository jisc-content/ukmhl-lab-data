The pelvic bones present a remarkable contrast to those of the shoulder, being always anchylosed on either side into one piece, but being with one exception j never joined in the mesial line, while this is the only place where the elements of the scapular apparatus are in general united by bone. In the young bird the os innominatum is seen to be formed by the usual three bones, viz. the ilium, ischium, and pubis, corre- sponding respectively to the scapula, coracoid, and clavicle, of the anterior extremity.

CIRRHOPODA; Cirripedia; Cirripeds; (xi£co; and woD;, cirrus and pes, from the curl- like form which the coiled feet or arms present. Fr. Cirripides. Ger. Rankenfuesser.) A class of invertebrate animals, composed chiefly of the barnacles and acorn-shells. They are re- lated in some points of structure with the annu- lated or diploneurose animals, particularly with Crustacea ; in other points they resemble Ace- phala (Conchifera). All are marine and fixed. The soft parts are, for the most part, encased in a multivalve shell. The body is somewhat conical in form, tumid, and bent inwards at the oral extremity, tapering towards the oppo- site extremity, where it terminates in a long pointed tube. Placed along the abdominal surface, there are two rows of fleshy lobes, (six on either side,) each having two long horny processes, jointed and ciliated. In some species, these constitute the chief bulk of the whole animal. The head is indistinctly de- fined, and has neither eyes nor tentacles; mouth with lips, and three pairs of horny jaws ; anus at the base of the tubular process. Respiration is effected by branchiae, which, in some species, are filamentary, in others foli- ated. Mantle membranous, sacculated, pro- vided with a slit-like opening for the passage of the arms, &c. Between each two pairs of arms, the abdominal surface is marked by six slight depressions, which may be regarded as an approach towards complete articulation. The animals thus characterized have had dif- ferent places assigned to them in the various systematic arrangements of modern zoologists. Cuvier formed of them the sixth and last class of his Mollusca. Lamarck was at one period inclined to place them amongst the Crustacea, but latterly he constituted for them a distinct class, and placed it between Annelida and Conchifera; still, however, regarding them as more closely allied to Crustacea than to any other class; " for,'' as he remarked, " they have the nervous system of Crustacea, they have jaws analogous to those of the animals of that class, and their tentacle-like arms resemble the antennae of the lobsters."* Bur- * An. sans Vertebres, v, 377, 2 Y 2

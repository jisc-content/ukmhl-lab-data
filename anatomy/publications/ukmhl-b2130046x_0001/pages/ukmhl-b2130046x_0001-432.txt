The blood of the mammalia contains rather less, and there is a difference to be noted in this respect between the carnivorous or omnivorous tribes, and the herbivorous, the proportion of solid particles being larger in the two former than it is in the latter. We see, indeed, that in man, the dog, and the cat, they enter in the proportion of twelve or thirteen per 1000, whilst in the horse, sheep, calf, and rabbit, they form no more than from the seventh to the ninth per 1000 of the general weight of the blood. But the number of species hitherto examined is not so considerable as to enable us to say that the circumstance, now announced, is to be regarded in the light of a physiological law. Among the cold-blooded vertebrate animals the blood becomes much poorer in solid particles; the tortoise, indeed, seems, from the results in the table, to form an exception to this fact, but the circumstances under which the estimates were made in regard to it, and which it would be too long to enter upon here, explain the anomaly.* The proportion of serum and of solid parti- cles also presents considerable varieties in the blood of different individuals of the same species. From the investigations of M. Lecanu we observe that the proportion of water in the human blood varies from 853 to 778 in 1000, and that of the solid particles from 148 to 68. The differences of sex have also a certain influence on the composition of the blood : M. Lecanu found in regard to The blood of man (in 1000 parts.) Solid particles. Water.

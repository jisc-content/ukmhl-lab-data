Aim. 217 of the cutaneous nerves of the arm and the superficial veins and absorbents lie imbedded in it: thus the cephalic vein and twigs of the external cutaneous nerve appear along the outer edge of the arm, and along the inner edge are found the internal cutaneous nerve, the brachial branches of the second and third intercostal nerves, the cutaneous nerve which arises from the ulnar high in the axilla, the- basilic vein, and a few lymphatic glands, which lie at from one to three inches above the internal condyle. Aponeurosis. — Beneath the subcutaneous layer of cellular tissue lies the aponeurosis or fascia, which invests the muscles and the deep- seated vessels and nerves of the arm: this fascia commences above at the superior attach- ment of the deltoid muscle; externally and internally it is continuous with the fascia, which extends over the axillary space; descend- ing along the arm it is strengthened by ex- pansions which it receives from the tendons of the deltoid, pectoralis major, and coraco- brachial in front; and behind it derives an accession of strength from the aponeurosis which covers the infra-spinatus and teres minor, and from the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. At the lower part of the arm the fascia is attached to the condyles of the humerus; laterally and posteriorly it is at- tached to the olecranon, on either side of which it is continuous with the fascia on the posterior surface of the fore-arm. In front of the elbow this fascia receives a fasciculus of fibres from the tendon of the biceps, and becomes continuous with the fascia covering the anterior surface of the fore-arm. The fascia of the arm varies in strength in different parts; it is very indistinct over the deltoid, thin but very fibrous on the posterior surface of the arm where it covers the triceps; it is much stronger over the biceps, and the thickest portion of it is found along the inner edge of the arm, where it covers the brachial artery and its accompanying veins and nerves. A strong aponeurotic septum passes in from the fascia of the arm to each of the lateral ridges of the humerus ; these septa are called intermuscular ligaments, and, together with the humerus, divide the space included within the general fascia into an anterior and a posterior sheath ; the external intermuscular ligament extends from the insertion of the deltoid to the external condyle; the internal extends from the inser- tion of the coraco-brachialis to the internal condyle. Both intermuscular ligaments are narrowest above, and grow broader as they approach the condyles : their surfaces give at- tachment to fibres of the triceps posteriorly and to the brachials anticus, supinator radii longus, and extensor carpi radialis anteriorly. The posterior sheath,formed as above described, is chiefly occupied by the triceps muscle, be- neath which, in the spiral groove on the pos- terior surface of the humerus, lie the musculo- spiral or radial nerve and the superior pro- funda artery: this nerve and the anterior or musculo-spiral branch of the superior pro- funda artery perforate the external inter- muscular ligament and enter the anterior sheath of the arm to get between, the brachiaeus anticus and supinator radii longus, while the posterior branch of the profunda descends within the posterior sheath to the back part of the external condyle; the ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda artery enter this posterior sheath together at its internal side, about the middle of the arm, and descend within it to the back of the internal condyle. A considerable branch of the brachial artery, the ramus anas- tomoticus, perforates the internal intermuscular ligament above the internal condyle, and enters the lower part of the posterior brachial sheath. The anterior sheath of the arm contains the biceps, coraco-brachialis,brachiaeus anticus, and the origins of the long supinator and long radial extensor muscles; the external cutane- ous nerve traverses this sheath, perforating the coraco-brachialis above, and descending ob- liquely outwards between the brachiaeus anticus and the biceps it gets to the outer side of the latter, between the tendon of which and the supinator radii longus it pursues its course to the fore-arm; the radial nerve and the branch of the superior profunda artery accompanying it are to be found in the lower and external part of the anterior sheath, which they enter as above described: these lie deep between the brachiaeus anticus and supinator longus. Along the internal side of this anterior sheath, through its whole extent, run the brachial artery, and its two venae comites included in a sheath proper to them, and accompanied by the median nerve, which has very important relations to these vessels : this nerve is external to the artery above, crosses it in the middle of the arm, and lies internal to it below. Superiorly the ulnar nerve lies to the inner side of the brachial artery, from which it se- parates to enter the posterior sheath, as already noticed; the internal cutaneous nerve, the cutaneous twig of the ulnar nerve, and the basilic vein for a short part of its course before it enters the brachial vein, also lie within this sheath; and deeply situated in its lower part is the ramus anastomoticus magnus of the brachial artery. Developement.— In the progressive deve- lopement of the upper extremity in the foetus, the arm is formed subsequently to the hand and fore-arm, and at an earlier period than the shoulder. In men the deltoid is fuller, and the biceps in front and the triceps behind are more prominent than in women : the greater fulness of these two latter muscles, with the smaller quantity of subcutaneous fat, give to the male arm a greater diameter from before backwards than in the transverse direction; while the more slender character of the muscles and the greater abundance of subcutaneous fat laterally cause the arm of the female to assume a more rounded form. In the course of the brachial artery two trunks are often found to exist, in consequence of a high branching of that vessel, which sometimes occurs even at the lower border of the axilla: the supernumerary branch in such cases is most frequently the radial: in some instances it is the ulnar and less fre- quently the interosseous or median artery of the fore-arm. When this irregularity occurs, the

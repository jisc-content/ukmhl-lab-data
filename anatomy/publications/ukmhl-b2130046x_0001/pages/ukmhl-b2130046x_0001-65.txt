47 ACIDS, ANIMAL. ACRITA. AC:iDS, ANIMAL. Several acids are found in animal products, some of which are peculiar to organized bodies, and others com- mon to them and to the other kingdoms in nature. The former are characterized by their analogy to other organic compounds, and are ternary or quaternary combinations of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The latter are for the most part binary compounds, such as the phosphoric, carbonic, muriatic, sul- phuric, and fluoric acids. With the exception of lactic acid, the exis- tence of which as a distinct definite compound is doubtful, there is only one acid which can strictly be called peculiar to animals, namely, the uric acid. The oxalic, benzoic, and acetic acids are common to animals and vegeta- bles. The other animal acids are not found ready formed, but are artificially produced by various chemical processes in which animal matters are concerned. Such are the various acids from fat and oil, the animal pyroacids, the purpuric acid,* and a few others. There are also cer- tain acids almost peculiar to individual animals, such as the formic,f the allantoic or amniotic,! the bombic, &c.,ยง and one or two which are the products of disease. Under the articles fat, urine, milk, and bone, will be found the details respecting the principal animal acids. ( W. T. Brande.) ACRITA (a, priv. kwo, discerno,) a pri- mary division of the animal kingdom founded by Virey, and so called by Macleay,|| composed of the lowest classes of the radiate animals of Cuvier, and characterised by an indistinct, dif- fused, or molecular condition of the nervous system. The necessity for a dismemberment of the Radiataof Cuvier, which RudolphiK justly calls a chaotic group, has been felt, and directly or indirectly expressed, by most naturalists and comparative anatomists.** It is impossible, in- deed, to predicate a community of structure in either the locomotive, excretive, digestive, sensitive, or generative systems, with respect to this division, as it now stands in the " Regne Animal."

La denomination a"animaux ra- yonnes ne leur convient pas plus que la prece- dente ; car ellc ne peut s'appliquer ; qu'a une partie d'entr'eux ; et il s'en trouve beaucoup parmi eux qui n'ont absoluimnt rien de la forme rayonnante."

Taking, then, the nervous system as a guide, the radiata of Cuvier will be found to re- solve themselves into two natural groups, of which the first, composed of the Poh/astric In- fusoria of Ehrenberg, the Polypi of Cuvier, the Entozoa parenchymatosa, Cuv. or Sterel- mint-ha, and the Acalepha?, differs in the absence or obscure traces of nervous filaments from the second division, including the Echinoderma, the Entozoa cuvitaria or Calelmintha, the epi- zoa, and the Rotifera, Ehr., in which nervous filaments are always distinctly traceable, either radiating from an oral ring, or distributed, in a parallel longitudinal direction, according to the form of the body. These different conditions of the nervous system are accompanied with corresponding- modifications of the muscular, digestive, and vascular systems, and a negative character, ap- plicable to the higher division of Cuvier's Radiata, may be derived from the generative system. With respect to the muscular system, we find that although all the Acriia possess the loco- motive faculty at some period of their exist- ence, and many never become fixed, yet that distinct muscular fasciculi are not necessarily developed. In the fresh-water polype, for ex- ample, the whole of the homogeneous paren- chyma of which it consists is equally con- tractile ; and even in the medusa, which ranks among the highest of the Acrita, no distinct muscular organs for effecting the contractions of the gelatinous disc have yet been detected. In the higher division of radiata, on the other hand, which from the filamentous condition of the nervous system may be termed Nemato- neura, the muscular system is always distinctly eliminated. The difference in the condition of the diges- tive system between the Acrite and Nemato- neurous classes is still more striking: in the former the alimentary canal is excavated in the parenchyma of the body, and is devoid of dis- tinct parietes: in the Nematoneura it is pro- vided with a proper muscular tunic, and floats in an abdominal cavity. A corresponding difference is presented by these two divisions of the invertebrate animals, in the condition of the vascular system. Where traces of sanguiferous organs are met with in the Acrita, they are equally with the digestive organ devoid of proper parietes, but consist of reticulate canals in the substance of the body, generally situated near the surface, and in which a cyclosis of the nutrient fluids is observed analogous to that of plants, but not a true circulation. This structure obtains in the Acrita as low down in the scale as the poly- gastrica, in which class Ehrenberg has deter- mined the existence of a superficial network of vessels containing an opaline fluid.

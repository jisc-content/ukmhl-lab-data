3 ABDOMEN. with hair ; in the female it is much more pro- minent than in the male, and is called the mom Veneris. In subjects where the muscular sys- tem is well developed, there exists on each side of this median groove an oblong convexity, ex- tending from the anterior surface of the lower part of the chest to the pubis; these convexities indicate the situation of the recti muscles. In statues representing athletic men, the promi- nences occasioned by these muscles are gene- rally very well shewn,and are divided by trans- verse superficial depressions into smaller qua- drilateral portions, generally three in number. External to these prominences there is, in similar muscular subjects, a fissure extending from the border of the chest, in a slightly curved course with external convexity, to a point a little to the inner side of the anterior superior spine of the ilium ; this fissure has internal to it the prominence from the recti muscles, and external that from the broad muscles of the abdomen. Gerdy calls it the lateral groove or furrow of the abdomen.* (See Jig. 1.) The posterior wall or the region of the loins, (lumbar region,) is in every way of less extent than the anterior. Its vertical height is equal to the distance between the last rib and the margin of the ilium. It is continuous on the sides with the flanks, and is divided along the middle line by a groove, corresponding to the lumbarspinous processes, into two symmetrical portions, each of which forms a large and pro- minent relief. Each relief corresponds to a great muscular mass, which almost wholly oc- cupies this region, and its prominence is greatest when those muscles are in a state of contrac- tion, as during the erect posture. Each relief is concave from above downwards, and in a degree directly proportionate to the conlrac- * Gcrtly, Anatomic dcs Formes Extericures, p. 189.

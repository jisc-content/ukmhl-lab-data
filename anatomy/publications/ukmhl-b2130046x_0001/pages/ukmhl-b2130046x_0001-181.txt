ABNORMAL CONDITION OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. 161 Partial luxation forwards of the tibia at the external ankle, with fracture of the fibula near the malleolus. Fig. 57. Viewed on the external side. Fig. 58.

I, tensor tendons were stretched over the tibia, and were somewhat flattened, and the grooves which transmit the tendons that play behind the inner and outer malleolus were deepened. We now directed our attention to the state of the bones; we found that the tibia was dis- placed forwards, that its anterior edge was ad- vanced more than one inch beyond its natural situation, and that it much overhung the os naviculare, but such was the direction and state of obliquity of the tibia with respect to the foot, that it could not be said to rest upon that bone; between the os naviculare and the infe- rior articular extremity of the tibia there inter- vened much fat of a yellow hue and fibrous texture, like intervertebral substance; the inter- nal malleolus itself had not escaped injury, the deltoid ligamenthad not in this instance as in the former given way; the internal malleolus itself had been broken, and a small portion of the back part of the edge of the articular cavity of the tibia was detached, and both malleoli were retracted, or carried backwards with the foot; the fibula above the fractured portion was directed down- wards and a little forwards, and was somewhat parallel to the tibia, yet more than naturally approximated to it, a circumstance which ac- counted for the contracted rounded form the middle of the leg possessed; the lower frag- Fig. 59.

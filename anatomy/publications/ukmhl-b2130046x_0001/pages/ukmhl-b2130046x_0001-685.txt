CIRCULATION. circulation of the blood, rapid as it may be, takes place in this remarkably short space of time, and we are disposed to suspect that the experiments themselves are liable to several sources of fallacy. The tendency of the prus- siate of potass to permeate the textures of the body, more freely than any other substance known, has been proved by many expe- riments, and it is therefore necessary that Hering's experiments should be performed with some other substances, before they can be re- garded as a correct means of estimating the rapidity of the circulation. The velocity of the blood is generally be- lieved to be greater in the pulmonic than in the systemic circulation,—an opinion founded chiefly on the supposed less capacity of the vessels belonging to the pulmonary trunks. Actual measurements of the velocity of the blood in the capillaries of the lungs of cold- blooded animals by Hales, Spallanzani, and others, would seem to give support to this view, but it must at the same time be re- collected that the course through which the blood passes in the pulmonary or lesser circu- lation, is considerably shorter upon the whole than that of the systemic or greater,—a circum- stance which must diminish to a certain extent the disproportion in the velocity.* b. Force of the blood in the arteries and force of the heart.—Another interesting inquiry con- nected with this subject relates to the force with which the blood is impelled in the arte- ries, and the calculations that have been made of the power of the heart itself, from the ob- servation of the force of the blood in the arte- ries. The experiments made with a view to discover these forces appear sufficiently simple in their nature; but the calculations founded upon the experiments have differed so widely, as to have furnished a plausible pretext for throwing ridicule on the application of physical laws to the living animal functions. As the arteries and other vessels are kept distended with blood by the action of the heart, it follows that were they rigid tubes, the force of the heart would, in accordance with the laws of propagation of pressure through fluids, be transmitted without loss through the whole column of blood in the arteries at one and the same moment: but in consequence of their yielding to distension, the force of the heart operates upon the blood only through the elastic reaction of the coats of the arteries. When an opening is made into one of the larger arteries, the blood issues with force, and spouts to some distance, but the height to * In reference to the above calculations, it must also be kept in mind, in the first place, that the estimate of the velocity of the blood in the pul- monic circulation in the frog can scarcely with propriety be applied to man, seeing that in the frog the pulmonary artery is only a branch of the aorta; and, in the second place, that in animals with a double circulation, although the quantity of blood which leaves both sides of the heart at each systole be equal, it does not necessarily follow that the whole blood which circulates through the system should in the same time pass through the lungs. which the blood rises when allowed to escape from a simple aperture in an artery varies from many accidental circumstances, and cannot therefore be taken as affording an accurate measure of the force with which the blood moves within the vessels. Hales seems first to have investigated this force in a more accurate and experimental manner, by observing the weight which the blood in one of the arteries of a living animal is capable of sustaining within a tube adapted to it. He remarked that the blood issuing from a simple aperture in the carotid artery of a horse and directed upwards did not rise above three feet,* but that when the blood was allowed to pass into a long glass tube adapted to the same artery it rose very quickly to a much greater height, as to nearly ten feet in some of the experiments. Hales performed similar experiments on the arterial flow in sheep, oxen, dogs, and other animals, and after observing for each the pressure which the blood in the arteries is usually capable of ex- erting, he endeavoured to compute the pres- sure of the blood in the arteries of man, by a comparison of the size of his whole body or heart and bloodvessels with those of the other animals. The pressure of the blood in the aorta of the horse being considered as eleven pounds, Hales estimates in the way above- mentioned the force of the blood in the human aorta at 4 lbs. 6 oz.; seven and a half feet being the height to which he supposed that the blood would rise in a tube connected with the larger arteries of a man. These experiments of Hales shewed in a very clear manner, that the height to which the blood rises in one of the larger arteries affords us the means of ascertaining directly the amount of pressure which the stream of blood impelled by the heart through the arte- ries is capable of exerting at any part of the arterial system, or in other words it gives us a measure of the statical force of the heart as it operates through the arterial tubes.f According to a well-known law of physics, the heart must be pressed upon in every part of its internal surface by the column of blood which it has raised; so that by multiplying the area of the internal surface of the ventricle into the height of the column of blood sup- ported in the tube connected with an artery, we shall ascertain the pressure which acts backwards on the inner surface of the heart. Hales estimates the inner surface of the ven- tricle of the human heart at fifteen square inches, and multiplying the pressure of a co- * This experiment we have repeated with Mr. Dick's assistance. t These experiments, as well as others subse- quently performed, demonstrate the importance of confining our researches in an inquiry of this nature to the estimation of the statical force operating in the organs of circulation, as the only useful ob- ject of such calculations,—the propriety of which is also sufficiently apparent from the extraordinary results of the attempts to estimate the dynamical power of the heart or the whole force generated in that organ by muscular contraction, by Borelli and Bernouilli, the first of whom calculated this force to equal 180,000, the second 3,000 lbs.

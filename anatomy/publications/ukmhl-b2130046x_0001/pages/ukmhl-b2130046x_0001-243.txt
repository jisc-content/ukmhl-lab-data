ARTERY. 223 maceration, the intervals between the fibres become greater, and as the putrefactive pro- cess sets in and advances, the whole substance of the middle tunic takes on the form of a spongy mass, and ultimately the fibres cease to be any longer discernible, having been re- duced to the state of a soft pulp, while the cellular structure is rendered more evident. The following appears to us to be the rationale of the phenomena above described : the in- crease in thickness which the middle tunic at first undergoes is owing to the cellular tissue interposed between the fibres imbibing the water in which it has been immersed, in virtue of its hygrometric property ; and the spongy appearance observable after the maceration has been continued for a length of time, is the result of the cellular tissue having the property of resisting decomposition by putrefaction much longer than the fibrous tissue. The internal tunic (intima of Haller) is the thinnest of the three; it is continuous with the lining membrane of the heart, in extending from which into the arteries it forms a dupli- cature, contributing to the composition of the semilunar valves : in the larger arteries, when empty, it sometimes forms longitudinal folds ; in some arteries, such as the poplita;al, and the brachial at the bend of the elbow, it presents transverse folds or wrinkles; it also forms transverse wrinkles in arteries which have re- tracted after amputation : its internal surface, which is in contact with the blood in the living body, is smooth, polished, and bedewed with a fine exhalation; its external surface adheres to the internal surface of the middle tunics in the larger trunks of the arteries; this tunic may be divided into two layers, the internal of which is thin and transparent, while the external is whitish and opaque, having its struc- ture blended with that of the middle tunic; it is the tunica cellulosa interior of Ilaller, and is the seat of the calcareous, steatomatous, and atheromatous deposits, which so frequently occur as morbid appearances in the coats of the arteries. We do not perceive fibres nor any other signs of organization in the inner layer of this tunic in its healthy state ; it is almost completely inelastic and very brittle ; it tears with equal facility in every direction ; compared with other structures it bears the closest resemblance to the arachnoid mem- brane of the brain; the smooth and highly polished condition of the free surface of this tunic is an admirable provision, whereby the effect of friction in diminishing the velocity of the passage of the blood through the arte- ries is reduced to the smallest possible amount. The following mechanical contrivance ob- servable in the interior of the arteries would appear to be a provision for facilitating the distribution of the blood through the divisions of the arterial system. As the branches of the arteries mostly arise from the trunks at acute angles, the portion of the circumference of their orifices on the side next the heart is smooth and depressed, forming a sort of chan- nel sloping gently from the trunk into the branch, while the opposite side, or that more remote from the heart, is bordered by a ridge of a semilunar valve-like form, composed of a duplicature of the lining membrane in which there is included a portion of the middle tunic ; the more acute the angle at which the branch arises, the greater is the prominence of this ridge; it is altogether absent where branches arise at right angles, as in the case of the emul- gent arteries, and where branches arise at ob- tuse angles to the trunk, it is found at their orifices on the side next the heart. The aorta and pulmonary artery are each provided with three valves at their origins from the ventricles; these valves, called sigmoid or semilunar from their semicircular form, are attached by their inferior borders, which are convex, to the margins of the semicircular flaps or festoons, into which the edge of the commencement of the middle tunic of the artery is divided ; the superior edges of each of these valves, which are free and floating, form two concave lines, separated by a projection in the centre, in which is con- tained a small cartilaginous body, called tubercle, globulus Arantii or corpus sesa- moideum. The portions of the walls of the artery corresponding to the valves are dilated in the form of pouches, more marked in the aorta than in the pulmonary artery; these are the sinuses of Valsalva. The semilunar valves are composed of a duplicature of the lining membrane of the artery, including within it a thin but strong fibrous expansion, continuous with the fibrous structure, which connects the middle tunic of the artery with the tendinous ring encircling the arterial opening of the ventri- cle ; the free border of each valve contains a smal 1 fibrous cord, as described by Beclard, having the globulus Arantii attached to it in its centre. An increase or diminution in the number of the sigmoid valves is of rare occurrence, more frequently presented in the pulmonary artery than in the aorta, and oftener consists in the number of valves being increased to four than diminished to two.* The mechanism of these valves is such as to prevent the blood flowing in a direction con- trary to its regular course ; for when that fluid is propelled towards the ventricle, they are separated from the parietes of the artery, and being distended by the column of blood pres- sing against their superior surfaces, they are laid across the area of the vessel, which they completely fill up by their edges being thus brought into perfect contact and the globuli Arantii meeting in the centre. There are no valves in the arteries in any other situation. The arteries, like other organized struc- tures, are furnished with proper nutritious arteries and veins called vasa vasorum. The aorta and pulmonary artery at their commence- ment receive some branches from the coronary vessels of the heart; in all other situations the vasa vasorum are supplied by the neighbouring bloodvessels; the vasa vasorum are very evi- dent in the external tunic of the arteries, they can be traced until they penetrate the sub- stance of the middle tunic, but not farther; * Meckel, Handbuch der menschlichen Anato- mic Band. i.

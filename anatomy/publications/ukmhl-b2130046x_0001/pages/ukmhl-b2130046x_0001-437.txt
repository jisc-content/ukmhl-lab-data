The specific gra- vity of the crassamentum was 1-088. The lightest blood which I have met with was of specific gravity 1-031, at 90° Fahren- heit. It was taken from the arm of a female, aged 22, who was bled on account of headach, and had a full pulse of 117. The red particles being the heaviest of all the constituents of the blood, their relative quantity must greatly affect its specific gravity; and as Messrs. Prevost and Dumas have shewn that they bear a general proportion to the de- gree of animal heat, we might reasonably sup- pose that, cateris paribus, the heaviest blood would be found in those diseases which are marked by high action and increased tempera- ment. In a fluid so complicated, however, in which every constituent is liable to such variety in quantity, it is difficult to estimate the precise influence of each. I am not aware that any experiments have been made on this subject. Blood diminishes in specific gravity in pro- portion to its frequent abstraction, for the red particles and the fibrine are reproduced with more difficulty than the serum or the salts. The serum also becomes lighter from a gradual di- minution of its solid contents. A recent paper by Mr. Andrews, in the fifteenth volume of the Medical Gazette, p. 592, proves these facts very satisfactorily by experiments made on calves. They have, however, been long known. The specific gravity of morbid blood, says Thackrah, differs little from that of healthy blood; but this observation is only true of an average deduced from numerous specimens of blood examined under different forms of dis- ease. It would be equally true, perhaps, according to the same mode of obtaining a result, were we to affirm that the temperature of the body or the state of the pulse differed little in health and disease, since there might be as many instances of deficiency as of ex- cess in heat or action. The assertion is not applicable to particular cases, and is, therefore, without value. Blood may be morbid from an undue proportion of any of its constituents, and it will be heavier or lighter than healthy blood according to the preponderance of the heavier or lighter principles. Where the spe- cific weight is increased, it is generally owing to a deficiency in the proportion of water, as in the blood of cholera and diabetes: sometimes to an increase of fibrine and red particles, as in plethora, gout, and rheumatism. The following table, containing the specific gravities of blood under several forms of dis- ease, is compiled from a few cases of my own which were recorded for another purpose. Though short, it will be sufficient to shew that considerable variety occurs, and may collaterally suggest that in determining the propriety of de- pletion, it may in some cases become impor- tant thus to ascertain the proportion of solid matter existing in the circulation. A specific gravity bottle, holding 1000 grains of distilled water, was employed in all the experiments, so that the proportion of serum to clot was not influenced by variation in the shape or material of the receiver. 417 ^ o> 2 ™ u o 3 p. «J 3*3 £ bore 2 3 S g o c -c bo C "3 £ .3 "" o e £ C 03 r-< ^ rf< o p -P. .3 « 3 cr1 . 5 s . > O n! o B *3 -a „r a 3 0>0>01OlOlOlOOOOOOO© 0>-HON»ltiSS03tOSTtnoOi OOOOOOOOOOOOOO' RRRRRRR~~~~-~ COCD'-0»C0^1^N.OKKOOO t>-c~co»oG>cococo<ococoa>to<o i'infi<n'Oi,fi,i,<o-f-flo OOOOOOOOOOOOOO bo aS O 3 Cue S F <*> a «S „T<e 'a « etc e 3 & g 00 Cu O- _, B ■ - M M .S el "S ^ cti W cu Q Q Ph M > S S <u 3 S 3 — — 0) » B » K o o-s S " 3 be bo. 2 a> <u CVS '.S ,fi -a ^ t. l, b. «-> ce d Ph > > Cm Q Q rfCOiN-fMOOtl-fOtO'O o -H ctf erf.*!: VOL.

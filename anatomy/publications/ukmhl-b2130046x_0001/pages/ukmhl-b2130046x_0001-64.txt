46 ACALEPH/E. loosely attached to the lower surface of the air-bladder. In the diphyda, they are in the form of numerous vesicles, having thick tunics filled with an opaque white fluid, and situated within one of their swimming organs. Such parts were seen by Eschscholtz only in some individuals, and on this account he was dis- posed to regard them as ovaries. But Messrs. Quoy and Gaimard seem to consider it more probable that the minute botryoidal bunches of vesicles, which surround the base of each sucker on the lengthened filaments, (before alluded to as being subservient both to nutri- tion and to locomotion,) are the ovaries.* Fis. 13. A portion of the ovigerous filament of Dipkyes muck magnified. It does not appear that either Eschscholtz or Messrs. Quoy and Gai- mard saw the ova. In the ciliograda, the ovaries are more obvious. They consist of two or four vesicular organs, each placed between two of the cilia-bearing arches. In cydippe, they are of a red colour, and nearly cy- lindrical shape. The ova are spherical. The parts in the pul- mograda corresponding to the organs just referred to, are eight round bodies, of small size, situated near the margin of the disc, each formed of a vesicle, containing, at its free ex- tremity, many minute hexagonal corpuscules; there is attached to each vesicle a digitated appen- dix, which seems to be hollow, and to com- municate with the circular vessel. These organs were seen by Gaede and by Miiller in medusa capillata, and M. aurita, and by Eschscholtz in some species of cyunea, sthe- nonia, pelagia, and chrysaora; Dr. M. Ed- wards has observed them also, at certain seasons, in rhizostoma; and in carybdea mar- supialis, he found, midway between each pair of pendent filaments, and immediately above a little notch in the margin, four spots of a deep brown colour, each of which appeared, under the microscope, to be formed partly by a minute spherical body, having a granular aspect, as if it were filled with eggs, and partly by a little sac, with puckered sides, which is imbedded in the gelatinous substance of the body. These he regards as the ovaries.f But, notwithstanding their having found gra- nular bodies like ova in the organs above described, neither Gaede nor Miiller considered them as ovaries. Miiller regarded the granules as excrementitious matters ; and Gaede thought that he saw the ovaries in the plaited mem- branes of the gastric cavities; whence he observed the ova descend into certain minute * Ann, des Sc.

Cuvier was also of opinion that the ova are formed in the plaited membranes above men- tioned, and that they are matured in the mar- gins of the arms.* No observations, so far as we know, have hitherto been made on the development of the ova; but Dr. Grant has recently stated that the ova of equorea are furnished with cilia, and have locomotive powers, like the ova of the pvrifera and polypifera.f The colours of the acalepha? often depend on the tints of their ova: these are generally red, but sometimes brown, yellow, or purple. VIII. Geographical distribution.-—-We con- ceive that a brief notice of this part of their natural history may, in some measure, illus- strate the physiology of the acalephse. They are met with in all seas ; but certain families exist more abundantly in some localities than in others. The ciliograda and pulmograda, for instance, are inhabitants chiefly of the colder regions, while the physograda are seldom found beyond the limits of the tropical zone. Some float in bays, and near land, but the greater number in the high seas. Medusa: and cyaneee are met with only in the cold and tem- perate zones of the northern hemisphere. Cy- dippe lives in the North Arctic Ocean, as well as in the Pacific, under the equator. One species of cestum inhabits the Mediterranean,—another the South Sea. It frequently happens that enormous numbers of one species are met with closely grouped together, so as somewhat to impede a ship's progress for two or three suc- cessive days; after which, not a single indi- vidual of the same species is seen. In the European seas, it is chiefly in summer and autumn that the acalephae swim on the surface. In winter, they probably sink to the bottom.

ABNORMAL CONDITION OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. M 2 synovitis, with purulent deposition in the joint, and in a young man aged twenty, but have not observed it ever to occur in older subjects ; and conclude that it is one of the consequences of synovitis of the ankle-joint, which is only to be noticed at an age when the epiphyses are not yet consolidated with the shaft of the tibia. In these very acute attacks of inflamma- tion, its ravages are seldom confined to the structure which seemed to be the 'point du depart' of the disease; the cartilages are in some cases removed from the tibia, fibula, and upper surface of the astragalus with astonishing rapidity; the porous surface of the bones has also been found exposed, and their substance to afford evidence of its having been in a state of inflammation. Surgeons should ever bear in mind, that the synovial membrane of the ankle-joint passes very far forwards on the upper surface of the astragalus, even as far as within a few lines of the junction of this bone with the os naviculare, so that an accidental wound high upon the instep might very readily give rise to a fatal synovitis of the ankle-joint. Moreover, by an experiment on the dead sub- ject, it may be shown that a very slight direc- tion too much upwards of the edge of the knife when the operation of partial amputation, ac- cording to Chopart, is performed, may wound the most anterior part of the synovial sac of the ankle-joint, and the consequences of such a mishap might prove fatal, or at all events greatly aggravate the ills which even without such cause too frequently follow Chopart's operation. Again, the synovial membrane extends very low down, even to the lowest point of the inner side of the peroneal malleolus, along the outer or fibular surface of the astragalus (Jig. 61, a). It has very frequently happened to the wri- ter's knowledge, that inflammation commencing in the body of the os calcis, or in the fibrous or synovial tissue of the articulation between the os calcis and under surface of the astragalus, has crept up to the ankle-joint by this route between the fibula and astragalus; when, therefore, opera- tionsandcauterizations are performed by surgeons to cure the carious state of the os calcis, the close contiguity of such an important articulation as that of the ankle should be recollected. The great proximity of the ankle-joint to that be- tween the under surface of the astragalus and os calcis can only be estimated by making a vertical section of the tibia, fibula, astragalus, and os calcis, passing transversely across these bones and through the malleoli, as may be seen in fig. 61 ; and if a subject be selected in which the epiphysis has not been consolidated with the rest of the bone, a useful view may be had illustrating many of the preceding practical observations, and explaining clearly how in- flammation, traumatic or idiopathic, once esta- blished in the ankle-joint, can pass through the epiphysis to the periosteum of the tibia; and ori- ginating either in the body of the os calcis, or in some of the structures composing the articulation between this bone and the under surface of the astragalus, can be propagated to the ankle-joint: such a viewas this will shew thenecessity of con- Fig. 61. sidering, in connexion, the normal and abnor- mal state of these important articulations. b. Chronic disease.â€”The effects of chronic diseases on the tissues composing the ankle- joint are next to be considered ; these are vari- ous, and may be referred to the influence of specific diseases, such as gout, syphilis, struma, rheumatism, &c; but the effects of most of these on this particular articulation need not here be discussed, as they will be sufficiently dwelt on elsewhere in this work (see Joint) : we deem it, however, right to enter somewhat into detail in the description of those morbid appearances of the ankle-joint which are supposed to be of a scrophulous origin, and which are denominated white swelling of the ankle-joint. The external characters of the affection are pretty much those in common with the same melancholy disease, in whatever articulation of the extremity it is situated; the swelling, at first soft, and appear- ing in front of each malleolus, seems divided into two by the extensor tendons; after a time it becomes more solid, and assumes somewhat of a globular form ; here as elsewhere, however, it does not completely surround the joint. The limb above is wasted and the heel is retracted ; the foot is cedematous, and the toes are pointed downwards, no motion of flexion or extension can be communicated to the foot; but when the bones are moved laterally, an unnatural motion is communicated to the foot, and a grating of rough and carious surfaces in advanced cases can be felt: the sides of the swelling are studded over with numerous fistulous orifices, from which even now a thin sanious matter can be pressed ; a probe introduced passes either directly through one or other of the malleoli, or by a circuitous route into the interior of the joint through the sinuses, which are, as

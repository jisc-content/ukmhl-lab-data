In simple glands, which are composed of intestinules and large follicles, the smallest blood-vessels wind along the walls of these intestinules and follicles, exactly as in any other animal membrane; for instance, the pulmonic mucous membrane. In these walls the transition of arteries into veins by reticular arches takes place in the usual manner. In compound glands, however, the ducts of which are small and very small, as in the kidneys, liver, and testicle, the uriniferous, biliferous, and seminiferous ducts are connected only externally with the most delicate vascu- lar networks, without the vessels winding on the thin walls of these ducts. XY. The ultimate distribution of the blood-vessels does not. al- ways follow the formation of the secreting canals. In the liver of the embryo, indeed, where the paniculate and pinnatifid ends of the biliferous ducts spring from the surface, so as to be seen by the microscope, the blood-vessels, though smaller, imitate a similar distribution ; for they run in the middle of a panicula or foliolus, and with their final smallest capillary twigs descend between the closed ends of the ducts or acini. But in glands which arc formed of serpentine unbranched ducts, everywhere equal in diameter, the blood-vessels are not serpentine, but with very small branches, creep among the gyri or turns of the serpentine ducts. XVI. That the smallest currents of blood run freely between the acini of a compound gland, as the liver, and that the blood is

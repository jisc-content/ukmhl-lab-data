TRACHEO-BRONCHIAL MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 597 § 5. Bronchitis from inhalation of particles of sand, dust, and metal. —Next to bronchial disease from the presence of foreign bodies, may be placed that form of the disease which is the result of the inhala- tion of sand, dust, or metallic particles in minute mechanical divi- sion. This has been already mentioned in a general manner.. But it may be proper to advert more particularly to the changes induc- ed in the lungs as presented by the artisans of Sheffield. These changes are not, indeed, by any means confined to the bronchi or their branches and membrane. But as the primary cause is applied first to the membrane of these tubes, it seems reason- able to consider the different lesions thus arising in the present place. In the town and vicinity of Sheffield two sorts of grinding of edged tools are practised; one dry grinding, on a dry stone, the other wet grinding, on a stone moistened with water. Many ar- ticles, as scissors, razors, and penknives, are ground partly on dry stone, and partly on the wet stone. Others, as forks and needles, are ground mostly on a dry stone. Table knives are ground principally on a wet stone. Saws, files, and scythes are ground entirely on a wet stone. Dry grinding is most injurious, and tends most directly and ef- fectually to induce bronchial and pulmonary disease, and thereby to abridge the duration of life among the grinders. The dry grinders, therefore, are most speedily destroyed. The life of the wet grinder is often prolonged to a considerable age. Of 1000 scissor-grinders above 20 years of age, only 20 attain the age of between 51 and 55 years, only 10 the age of between 61 and 65, and none live beyond the latter age ; while of the inhabi- tants of Sheffield generally, 244 in 1000 are found living at 65 and above, and in tbe midland counties, 413 in 1000. Of artisans in this branch 843 in 1000 die .under 45 years of age. With the fork-grinders it is worse. Among 1000 fork-grinders, aged above 20 years, not one attains the age of 59 ; while in Shef- field, among 1000 persons 155 are living at 59. Of these 1000 persons 472 die between 20 and 29 years, 410 between 30 and 39 ; and the residual 115 are all gone before the age of 50. Among 1000 razor-grinders above 20 years of age, 749 die un- der 41 years of age ; the rest mostly between 41 and 60 ; between 61 and 65 only 5 are living; and after 65 all are gone. Of the pen-knife grinders not one in 1000 arrives at the age of

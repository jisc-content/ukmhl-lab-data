SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 197 after certain intervals, which are progressively shorter, and always with the effect of increasing the enlargement. 3d, In all the cases in which the enlarged limb has been ex- amined by dissection, the subcutaneous and intermuscular filamen- tous tissue is hardened, thickened, and condensed, and contains a quantity of granular matter, viscid and gelatinous in consistence, but like fat in appearance. This has not been analyzed ; but little doubt can be entertained that it contains a good proportion of al- buminous matter. That this is the essential change, is established by the testimony of many observers. (Jaegerschmidt, Henseler, Kennedy, Graves, Hull.) The distension of the skin, the enlarge- ment of its papillae, the slender blanched appearance of the muscles, and the enlargement of the inguinal glands, are effects only of the state of the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue. In short, until new facts be adduced, the description given by Dr Graves, and the case of Mr Hull, establish the inference, that the elephantine enlargement of the extremities is the result of gelati- nous or albuminous exudation from the arteries of the subcutane- ous filamentous tissue. Dr Musgrave considers it as migratory in- flammation. 6. Accidental Development or Morbid Formation of the Exha- lant System. In several instances a process of exhalation takes place in certain textures in which it did not originally exist, at least under the same form; or a process of exhalation may go on without a corresponding one of removal by absorption. Of this abnormal development of the exhalant system, which constitutes the tumours called encysted, (tumores cystici, tunicati, Salzmann, Heister,) several varieties have been noticed by practical authors, as Ingrassias, Severinus, Tagault, Pare, Sehelhammer, Astruc, Meek len, Heister, &c.; and^the division of Celsus into meliccris, atheroma, and steatoma, has been repeated by the generality of writers, from Hildanus to Monteggia, Abernethy, and Boyer. This division, to which I have already adverted in speaking of en- cysted tumours in the cellular tissue, is nevertheless imperfect; and indeed no distinct and connected arrangement of all the varieties of encysted tumour has yet been given, unless the seventh genus of the system of Plenck be entitled to this character.* Without attempting to specify the individual defects of the classification of Josephi Jac.

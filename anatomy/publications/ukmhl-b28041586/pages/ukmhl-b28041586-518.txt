GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 496 (symphyses), is remarked in adults, or those advanced in life so frequently, that it cannot be regarded as disease. In the vertebras it is also observed, though less frequently. It has been seen most generally in the dorsal and lumbar vertebra?, which are thus indis- solubly ankylosed. The accidental, or new development of the chondro-desmoid tissue, is not uncommon ; and its appearance constitutes the ana- tomical character of the most usual form of scirrho-carcinoma. In this state irregular or amorphous masses of fibro-cartilage are de- veloped in isolated points of the organs; and by their coalescence progressively invade or destroy the original texture of the part. In some instances, a mass of cartilage is traversed irregularly by intersecting white or yellow fibrous bands. In others, irregular nodules of cartilage are separated by ligamentous partitions. This deposition, which ever manifests a tendency to fatal disorganization, is most frequent in the female breast, in the womb, in the lacrymal and parotid glands, and in the intestinal canal of both sexes. In its progress to ulceration, cavities are formed containing brownish jelly-like fluid ; and as it approaches the surface, fungous growths and hemorrhage are frequent.

general and pathological anatomy. 458 bone being found within another was remarked Duverney, Ruysch,* a Meek’ren,f Chesclden and others of the older anatomists and sur- geons ; and even Portal speaks of the circumstance of one bone rattling within another as a curious and unexplained phenomenon.^ Next to the case given by Chesejclen, Laing§ in 1737, and John- ston || in 1742, described cases of removal of the tibia and regene- ration of the bone. TrioenlT and Arayand** describe the same facts under the name and as examples of spina ventosa; and Mac- kenzie,ff William Hunter,^ Ludwig,§§ Bromfield,|||| and others de- scribe the disease with the process of regeneration under various names, as detachment of the epiphyses, caries, loss of a bone, or re- production, destruction of the diaphyses, according as any one part of the process was most prominent, without appearing to be aware of its true nature. Ludwig, indeed, appears to have been the first, or among the first, who investigated carefully the nature of the change, tie published in 1772 two cases of the disease ; one in the tibia, with recovery ; and another in the femur, in which the pa- tient had died, and in which he described the appearances found in the bone. In the latter case a considerable dead fragment of the os femoris had come away in the fifteenth year of the patient, six years after the commencement of the disease, followed by about 30 frag- ments varying in size. This patient survived to her 25th year; * Thesaur. Anatom. VIII. Fig. 2, 3, 4. f Jobi a Meek’ren Chirurgi Amstelodamensis Observationes Medico-Chirurgicae. Amstelodami, 1682. Cap. LXIX. p. 328.

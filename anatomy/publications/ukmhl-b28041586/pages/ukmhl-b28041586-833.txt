GLANDULAR ORGANS. 811 CHAPTER II. MORBID STATES OF THE GLANDULAR ORGANS. The morbid states of the glandular organs are very numerous and varied; and if we remember bow often their function is dis- ordered, to bow many morbid changes their secreted products are liable, bow many changes may take place in their circulation, in- dependent of changes in their structure, we must allow that theie is scarcely a texture in the whole frame which presents so many forms of diseased action as the glands. It would lead me into a field too extensive to consider all the varieties of disorder and diseased action to which I have now ad- verted. It must also be admitted, that the subject is in many re- spects imperfectly known; and that the consideration of various changes incident to glandular action would lead me into inquiries inconsistent with the nature of the present work. I propose, there- fore, to confine the present sketch very much, if not entirely’ to the morbid states most frequently taking place in the system of the se- creting glands. Section I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON DISORDERS OF THE SECRETING GLANDS. The glands, from being liberally supplied with blood-vessels, are 1a lie to be affected by all the changes which take place in the vas- cular system The blood, indeed, maybe regarded as the first great agent winch affects the state of the functions of the secreting g ands. All substances taken into the blood are circulated to the gands, and in a degree greater or less affect their secretions Thus, mercury and its preparations, which have been erroneously upposed to act on the salivary glands only, act at the same time also !,-TrC“V ° Ver’ “nd th° kidneJ'S- In the same manner 'l 7T 7 CleS Containi”S ‘ham are absorbed by ns, circulated and conveyed to the different glands, and in

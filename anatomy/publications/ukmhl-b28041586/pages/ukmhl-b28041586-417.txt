BOOK III. STEREOMORPHIC TEXTURES. KINETIC TEXTURES. The textures which next come under observation are those which give solidity and figure to the body, or the Stereomorphic Tex- tures ; and as in general they are the agents of movement, they may be called Kinetic Textures. These are muscle, sinew, or tendon, white fibrous system, yellow fibrous system, bone, cartilage, and fibro-cartilage. CHAPTER I. Section I. flesh, thew, muscle.

The ordinary appearance of the substance named flesh or muscle must be familiar to all; and it is unnecessary to enumerate those obvious characters which are easily recognized by the most careless observer. A portion of muscle, when carefully examined, is found to consist of several animal substances. It is traversed by arteries and veins of various size; nervous twigs are observed to pass into it; it is often covered by dense whitish membranous folds, (fascia?,) or by serous or mucous membranes, all which will be examined af- terwards ; and it is found to contain a large proportion of fila- mentous tissue. But it is distinguished by consisting of numerous fibres disposed parallel to each other, and which may be separated in the same manner by proper means. The appearance, arrange- ment, and characters of these fibres demand particular notice. According to Prochaska, muscle in all parts of the body may be resolved, by careful dissection, into fibres of great delicacy, as mi- nute as silk-filaments, but pretty uniform in shape, general appear- ance, and dimensions. Their diameter appears not to exceed

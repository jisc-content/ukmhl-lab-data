A portion only of the pa- rotid gland was removed, and that portion is incorporated with the anterior edge of the tumour, and most intimately connected with it. The disease is supposed to have commenced in the lymphatic gland always situate in this position, and to have secondarily affect- ed the parotid gland.* In 1805, Dr John M‘Lellan of Green Castle, Franklin County, Pa., removed from the parotid region, in a female of 50, a tumour large and ulcerated, believed to be affected with carcinoma. He tied the maxillary and temporal arteries.} The gland, moreover, has been, when affected by melanosis re- moved entirely by Dr Mott of New York.} M. Larrey is stated to have extirpated the parotid gland in a young man of 19 for scirrhus. I have no doubt that this was mere strumous induration.§ In 1842, M. Jobert stated to the Royal Academy of Medicine that an American physician extirpated, in a man of 62, a large tumour in the parotid region, believed to be affected with scirrhus. In 1842, Dr Wheeler of Dundaff, Susquehanna, removed from the parotid region of a man, age not mentioned, a tumour of con- siderable size, stated very confidently to be scirrhous in texture and to affect the whole parotid gland. The external carotid artery was tied. 1[ * " ^ Professor.

762 GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. the form of tubules, sometimes of cells, sometimes of glandular cells inclosed within membranous partitions {septa.) V. Glands of the fifth order. Lobulated glands com- posed OF aggregations of small intestinal c^eca. 1. A gland composed of clusters of small intestinal caeca arranged in lobules, as the pancreas of the tunny. 2. A gland composed of blind branching intestinula, arranged like leaves in lobules; for instance, the prostatic glands and Cowperâ€™s glands in the hedgehog. 3. A gland composed of branched intestinula caeca irregularly ar- ranged. VI. Glands of the sixth order. Branched excretory DUCTS INCLOSED FROM THEIR ORIGIN TO THEIR TERMINATION BY ELEMENTARY PARTICLES. This arrangement, which resembles efflorescence, is not terminal, but is similar to the protracted efflorescence of botanical terminology. Of this examples are found in the liver of the Crustacea, the lacry- mal gland of the tortoise, and the lacrymal gland of birds. VII. Glands of the seventh order. Compound ramifica- tion IN A LOBULATED GLAND, WITH TRUNKS OF EXCRETORY DUCTS CONTINUOUS AND ENTIRE AMONG LATERAL BRANCHES AND VESICULAR ENDS OF ULTIMATE'DUCTS. The trunk of the excretory duct, entire and continuous, is not divided into branches, but sends out laterally small branches, which are also continued entire and without interruption by lateral rami- fication, The result of this arrangement is great, small, and very small lobules; because each trunk with lateral branches makes a large lobe ; branches with lateral shoots make small lobes of the second order; and from the twigs, and their attached portions the smallest lobules arise. This origin of the lobules is shown from the history of the development of the embryo. To this mode of arrangement belong the salivary glands, the pancreas, the mammae, and the lacrymal gland of many mammalia. VIII. Glands of the eighth order. Compound ramifica- tions IN glands not lobulated with division of trunks INTO IRREGULAR BRANCHES, WITH SHORT OR TERMINAL VESI-

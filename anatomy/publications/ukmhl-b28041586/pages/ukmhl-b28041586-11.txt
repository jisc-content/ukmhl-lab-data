The elaborate, but somewhat confused, collection of Bonetus was the first attempt to classify the facts observed by these and previous authors. To Morgagni, however, was reserved the merit of publishing a work, distinguished equally by critical knowledge of the labours of his predecessors and contemporaries, and by accurate personal observation. From the days, indeed, of Fantoni, Valsalva, and Morgagni, to those of Sandifort, Baillie, Meckel, and Laennec, the study of Morbid Anatomy has been as- siduously cultivated by all who were interested in the progress of accurate knowledge. At no period, however, has this department of science been pur- sued with greater zeal than during the last twenty years, in the course of which the observation and collection of pathological facts has engrossed the attention of numerous observers, both in this country and in France and Germany. Of this the result has been, moie accurate distinction of diseases formerly confounded, fuller and more precise information regarding those which were imper- fectly known, and an extraordinary accumulation of matter on all topics. In some instances the boundaries of the science have been extended; in others, departments already known have been more

GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 930 which gout affects the kidney ; and it is known by the individual having presented more or fewer of the symptoms of gout, and by the disease terminating in or being associated with a paroxysm of regular gout. Renal inflammation may ensue on blows or contusions on the loins; falls in which the kidney, with other organs, suffers concus- sion ; carrying heavy loads on the back, or wrenches in conse- quence of falling in carrying loads; riding on horseback ; riding in a carriage over a rough road; the presence of renal concretions or sabulous matter in the infundibula or pelvis, especially if the former be rough, or angular; various irritants taken into the stomach, which either induce acidity, or being absorbed by the blood-vessels, are enabled to irritate the tissue of the kidney, as some of the vegetable acids and fruits, acid wines; the application of cantharides externally, or their use internally; the terebinthinate, resinous, and balsamic substances; cold applied to the lumbar re- gion, especially when overheated; inflammation of the adjoining or- gans, as the liver, spleen, duodenum, colon, psoas muscle, the dor- sal or lumbar vertebrae; and in some instances inflammation of the bladder, extending upwards through the ureters, either resulting from excessive distension of these organs, or without distension. Of the whole of these circumstances which may be regarded as exciting causes, the operation is very much favoured by the presence of the gouty or calculous diathesis already mentioned. Inflammation may attack either the pelvic and calycine membrane of the kidney; or the substance of the gland; or the external sur- face of the gland, with or without its investing membrane. The most common is inflammation of the calycine membrane, or that part of the mucous epithelial membrane of the kidney, which extends upwards from the pelvis into the calyces and papillcE. This membrane is then injected into blood, covered by a coating of - lymph more or less thick, and the free surface of which is formed into a multitude of minute processes or scales, while purulent mat- , ter is eventually deposited within this. The subsequent course of this process shall be noticed presently. When the substance of the kidney is inflamed, it becomes of a deep red or reddish brown colour, abounds in blood-vessels, much loaded with blood; the whole organ is enlarged in all its dimen- sions ; and its substance is copiously infiltrated with bloody scrum. As to consistence, nothing is certain; the inflamed kidney being 3

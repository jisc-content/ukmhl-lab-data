GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 610 incipient stage of the disease. It is nevertheless impossible to doubt that these ulcers, -whether in the state of ulcers, or appearing after- wards as perforations, must originate in inflammation which proba- bly attacks one point and is circumscribed to that, while it is slow in progress and chronic in character. Instances of this lesion have now become numerous. Cases have been recorded by Morgagni,* * * § Dr Carmichael Smyth,! Gerard,! Dr Baillie,§ Dr Crampton, || Mr Travers,IT Laennec,** * * §§ Dr Aber- crombie,!! Dr Elliotson,!! M. Duparque,§§ M. TJebersaal,|||| M. Goeppert,1ii[ and Cruveilhier. From these cases, and seven which have been observed and inspect- ed by myself,*** I conceive the following general conclusions re- garding the nature and character of this lesion may be established. It is, in the first place, remarkable that the majority of these cases of ulcerative destruction of the mucous membrane of the stomach are situate either in the small arch of the stomach, or very near the small arch. In the case by Dr Carmichael Smyth, it was in the anterior part towards the cardia. In the first case by Ge- rard, it was in the small arch, one inch from the pylorus. In his fifteenth case also, a circular hole was found at the right and an- terior side of the small curvature. It is unnecessary to refer to all his cases, because he does not distinguish between simple in- flammatory ulceration and that which is the effect of tubercular de- struction and cancer. In the case by Dr Baillie, it was near the small curvature on its posterior side, about two inches from the cardia. In the case by Dr Crampton, it was at the union of the cardiac and pyloric portions. In the instance ol the late M. Bec- ked, the anatomist, who had laboured under symptoms leading to * De Sed. et Caus. Epist. xxix. 14. I am doubtful whether this case be not the result of tubercular ulceration. -f Medical Communications, Vol. ii. p. 467. t Des Perforations Spontandes de l’Estomac. Par M. Alexandre Gerard, D. M., &c.

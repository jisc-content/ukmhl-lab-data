GLANDULAR TISSUE—DIAMETER OF SECRETING TUBES. 771 XII. While canals, which always in insects and sometimes in the higher animals are observed free, are progressively increased by the new efflorescence, and mutually approximated, connected by blood-vessels,—from these free canals gradually a species of parenchyma arises. XIII. The most delicate reticulate blood-vessels are still much smaller than the most slender branches of the secreting canals, and their terminations in the largest glandular viscera. The elemen- tary parts of glands, therefore, though small, are nevertheless al- ways so capacious that they are enclosed and connected by the smallest reticulated blood-vessels. The cortical uriniferous canals are much larger than the smallest blood-vessels in all classes of animals. In the salivary glands of the mammalia and man, the most delicate blood-vessels are many times smaller than the acini of the salivary terminal vesiculoe. The same is true of the pancreas. The free ends of the salivary ducts in the hamster differ greatly from the very smallest blood-vessels. The closed ends of the bili- ferous ducts in the embryos of birds, amphibia, and mammalia are much larger than the smallest blood-vessels. To show the amount of this relation of majority of the secretino- ducts to the blood-vessels, and that of the relation of minority of the blood-vessels to the secreting ducts, Muller gives the respective diameters of these two orders of tubes as determined by himself by the micrometer. From these measurements a few examples are here selected. The smallest capillary blood-vessels, (Weber,) The same in kidney, (Muller,) The same in human iris, The same in human ciliary processes, Smallest pulmonary cells in man, (Weber,) Cylindriform intestinula in the lungs of embryo birds, Elementary vesicles of mammae of suckling hedgehog, Terminal cells in salivary ducts of goose filled with mercury, Terminal cells of salivary ducts of parotid in man filled with mer- cury, Cells of lacrymal gland of goose filled with mercury, Cells of pancreas of goose filled with mercury, Elements of lacrymal gland of Testudo mydas Cells of Harderian gland of hare filled with mercury, Terminal vesicles of biliferous ducts of snail, {Helix],omatia) * ree terminal twigs of bile-ducts in embryos of birds Intatimda of Wolffian body in embryo of bird, The same from another embryo, Paris inch. 0.00025— 0.00050 0.00037 — 0.00058 0.00037 — 0.00057 0.00053 0.00441 —0.01333 0.00474 0.00712 — 0.00928 0.00260 0.00082 0.00327 0.00137 — 0.00297 0.00194 0.00776 0.00565 0.00172 0.00377 0.00300

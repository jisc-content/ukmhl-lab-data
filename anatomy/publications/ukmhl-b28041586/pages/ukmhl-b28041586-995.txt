BOOK VI. THE LUNGS AND HEART. CHAPTER I. The Lungs. Section I. The Minute Structure of the Sound Lung. iiiE lungs may be regarded as the ramifications and terminal ends of the bronchial tubes, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins, all united by filamentous-cellular tissue and enclosed within the pleura. The filamentous-cellular tissue now mentioned forms with these enclosed textures the pulmonic substance, tissue, or parenchyma. The main point, however, which it is important to know, in order to understand either the structure of the lungs, as explana- tory of their morbid condition, or the functions of these organs duiing health, is the mode in which the bronchial tubes are distri- buted and terminate. This point has been partly considered already, when speaking of the ultimate termination of the bronchial mucous membrane. A few points I have here to add, in consequence of the question of these terminations having been again made the subject of research. Malpighi, who first studied the structure of the lungs with attention, maintained that the bronchi terminate in closed ends slightly expanded into the form of spherical or globular vesiculae (vesiculae orbiculares), which he in one passage compares to the cells of bee-hives.* This shows that lie believed that these vesiculae communicate with each other. He thought it also probable that these vesiculae are continuations or processes from the inner mem- brane of the windpipe,â€”in other words, from the bronchial mem- Duverney maintained, in 1699, that these vesicles or cells com- municate with each other; and Stephen Hales, who examined them in the calf by the microscope, represents them as little cubes or hexaedral figures,mot spherical, and estimates their diameter at i os' part of one lnch.f + Statical Lssays Vol. i. pp. 239 and 241.

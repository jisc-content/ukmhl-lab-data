SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 187 CHAPTER IX. SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS, ( VaSO. ex/ialtt/ltUl.) EXHALANT SYSTEM, ( Systeme exlialant.) Section I. Are there such vessels as the exhalants described by physiolo- gical authors ? Is their existence proved by observation or inspec- tion ? If not, what are the proofs from which their existence has been inferred ? The existence of minute arteries, the open extremities of which are believed to pour out various fluids in different tissues of the human body, has long been a favourite speculation with physiolo- gical anatomists. The decreasing vessels, (vasculorum continuo decrescentium multi sibique svccedentes or dines,)* and exhalant ori- fices of Boerhaave, are, or should be known to almost all. Haller ascribes to the skin, membranes of cavities, (serous membranes,) ventricles of the brain, the chambers of the eye, the cells of the adipose membrane, the vesicles of the lung, the cavity of the sto- mach and intestines, an abundant supply of these exlialant arteries or canals, which, according to him, pour out a thin, aqueous, jelly- like fluid, which, in disease, or after death, is converted into a wa- tery fluid susceptible of coagulation. The existence of these ves- sels, he conceives, is established by the watery exudation which appears in these several parts after a good injection of the ar- teries. f As these minute canals, however, through which this injected fluid is believed to percolate, have never been seen, or rendered capable of actual inspection, their existence was denied by Mas- cagni, who ascribed the phenomena of exhalation to the presence of inorganic porosities in the arterial parietes, through which he imagined the fluids transuded to the membranes or organs, in which * Haller, Elementa, Lib. ii. sect. i. and liis Notes on Boerhaave, Praelectiones,.

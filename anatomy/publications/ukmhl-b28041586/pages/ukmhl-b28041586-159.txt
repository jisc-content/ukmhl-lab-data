SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 137 capillaries in the substance of each. Bichat has justly observed that inflammation is very frequent in the cutaneous, mucous, se- rous, and filamentous tissues, which injection and microscopic ob- servation show to abound in capillary vessels, but rare in bone, cartilage, and the fibrous tissues in which there are few capillaries, or where the irritable or inflammatory susceptibility, (la sensibilite orqanique,) is more moderate. It is difficult to explain the infi e- quency of inflammation in muscular tissue without having recourse to this last property, which this author ascribes to the capillary vessels. Its sensibility to the operation of a stimulus is great. Its susceptibility of inflammatory action is very small. The change which takes place in the capillary vessels in the state of inflammation has given rise to much speculation, research, and i experiment. But it may be doubted whether the questions which have been agitated on this subject can yet be regarded as decided. On one point only is there any thing like agreement in the various opinions delivered. It appears to be now the general belief, that during the process of inflammation the capillary vessels of the part are dilated, and contain more blood than in the healthy state. (Cul- len, Hunter, Vacca, and many other authors.) On the cause of this dilatation, however, the sentiments of pathologists are as much at variance as ever; and not only are the results of experiments made to determine the circumstances on which this distended state of the capillaries depends, variable and sometimes contradictory, but the conclusions to which they have led are very opposite. One opinion is, that the dilatation depends on increased action; according to the other, it is the effect of a weakened state of the capillaries. The first of these doctrines, which in some form or other has been adopted from Stahl, and De Gorter, by Dr Cullen, appears to have been suggested by the increased number of the arterial pulse in a given space, the hardness and tension of its beat, the throb- bing of inflamed parts, and the violent and sometimes rapid changes of structure which attend inflammation. This has led to the con- clusion that the blood moves in the capillaries of such parts more rapidly, and with greater force, (momentum,) than in the healthy state. (Parry.) With superficial observers this opinion has pass- ed current, as generally consonant with the phenomena and effects of the inflammatory process; and the pathologist has studied to

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 135 and that there is actually an individual capillary system, not only for every organ, but in some instances for every tissue. The biain possesses an individual capillary system ; and that of the mem- branes is evidently distinct from that belonging to the oigan itself. The heart and the kidneys possess -each an individual capillary system; and the liver may be said to have two,—one formed by the communication of the hepatic artery and veins, and another con- sisting of the divisions of the portal vein, with the branches of the hepatic hollow vein. ( Vena cava hepatica.) The organic properties of the capillary vessels arc as little known as their structure. Many physiological and pathological writers, especially experimentalists, have ascribed to them a power which has at different times been called muscular, tonic, irritable, con- tractile; and have asserted that, because the larger arteries are provided with a fibrous membrane, which they have called muscu- lar, and to which they have ascribed irritability, or the power of contraction when stimulated, their minute or capillary termina tions must have the same property. This conclusion is completely unfounded for two reasons. ls£, I have already shown that the proper arterial tunic is not muscular in structure, and, according to the best experiments, possesses no property of contraction when stimulated. 2d, Although it be admitted that the proper arterial tissue is muscular and irritable, it is quite certain that observation has not hitherto shown that this tunic can be recognised in arteries smaller than a line in diameter; and it is certain that in the capil- laries, properly so called, that is, in vessels which partake of the nature of artery and vein, no such structure has yet been observed. It is not improbable, however, that the capillaries possess certain organic or vital properties; but all that has been taught on this subject is either hypothetical, or derived from an insufficient and imperfect collection of facts. It is certain that the blood which moves through them is beyond the direct influence of the action of the heart, and can be affected by this only so far as it keeps the larger vessels constantly distended with a column of blood which cannot retrograde, and must therefore move forward in the only direction left to it. It has been therefore argued that the capil- laries must have an inherent power of contraction by which this motion is favoured. Is it not sufficient to say that they act merely as resisting canals, to prevent their contents from escaping, and to minister to the various tissues and organs those supplies of blood which the several processes of nutrition, secretion, &c. require ?

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 165 certain, not only by tlie facts now stated, but by tbe condition of the blood found in the vessels after death. That fluid is then found filling tbe arteries, as well as the veins, not scarlet, but of a dark-brown colour, and viscid, grumous, and very imperfectly coagulated. There appear, therefore, here, two remarkable circumstances ; one, the diminution or loss of coagulating power; the othei the di- minution or loss of arterialization. What is the cause of these changes ? It is reasonable to think that for this cause we ought to look chiefly in the lungs. The lungs, I have already observed, are in all cases of fever more or less disordered, their vessels are congested and oppressed; their ac- tion is impaired; and there is proof of great derangement in the action of the bronchial membrane, imperfect admission of air to the bronchial tubes and their membrane, and, accordingly, inade- quate arterialization, or it may be the lowest possible degree of that function. These may be regarded as matters of fact, capable of demonstration. Does this morbid state of the blood, then, begin in tbe lungs, or in some other part, or set of vessels ? When we consider the large extent of the bronchial membrane, the fact that upon it are ramified the capillary divisions of the pulmonary ar- tery and veins ; the fact that through these vessels passes the whole blood of the body, and the further fact of the manifest disorder of the whole blood of tbe system in fever, it is impossible to resist the conclusion, that it must be chiefly, perhaps solely, on the blood of the lungs, that the cause of fever begins to display its primary and initial operation. On the nature of this cause it is not possible to speak with con- fidence or certainty. But if the general opinion, that it is a poi- son diffused through the air, be well founded, it is not difficult to perceive at least some traces of its mode of operation. Whether that poison be extricated in the form of a vapour or exhalation from the surface of the earth, and is telluric in origin ; or is elimi- nated from vegetable matters in certain circumstances of decay or change; or from vegetable and animal matters conjoined; or is given off as a subtile effluvium from the bodies of living human beings, in circumstances unfavourable to ventilation and the healthy performance of the functions; or is the result of some unknown and unappreciable state of the atmosphere ;â€”it must equally be inhaled with the air in inspiration, and thus thoroughly mixed with the

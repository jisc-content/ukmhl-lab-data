GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 204 '• Melanoma. In many instances the melanotic matter, already mentioned, is deposited in a cyst. In such circumstances, there- fore, it is referable to this head.

In most situations of the human body, and especially in the vi- cinity of arterial and venous trunks, there are found long, slender, hollow tubes, pellucid or reddish, which present numerous knots, joints, or swellings in their course, and to which the name of lym- phatics or absorbents has been given. It is most expedient to em- ploy the former appellation only, as the latter implies the perform- ance of a function, the reality of which has been much questioned of late years. Though Eustachius had seen the thoracic duct in the horse, and some slight traces of a knowledge of vascular tubes, different either from arteries or veins, are found in the writings of Nicolaus Massa, Falloppius, and Veslingius, the merit of establishing their existence is generally ascribed to Caspar Asellius, a physician of Pavia. This anatomist, who had, in 1622, seen the white-coloured tubes, then first named lacteals, issuing from the intestines of the dog, observed also a cluster of vessels less opaque near the portal emi- nences of the liver,—an observation which he afterwards repeated in the horse and other quadrupeds. The same vessels were also described and delineated by Highmore. Passing over the uncertain and obscure hints given by Walaeus and Van Horne, tbe first exact information after Asellius is that which relates to Olaus Rudbeck, who, in 1650, is said to have seen them in a calf, and to have demonstrated the thoracic duct, and the dilated sac, afterwards termed receptaculum chyll 4

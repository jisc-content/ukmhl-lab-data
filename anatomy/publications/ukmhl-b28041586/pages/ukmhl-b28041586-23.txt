ELEMENTS GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. BOOK t CHAPTER 1. DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. The Human Body lias been said to consist of solid and fluid parts, the former of which are organized, and determine the shape of the body and its parts. In the same manner the solid parts were distinguished into simple and vital; the first of which were believed to possess only the general properties of matter, as weight, cohesion, elasticity, flexibility, &c. but to be destitute of sensibility and mobility, the great characteristics of the vital solids. Under the head of vital solids it is evident that the brain, cerebellum, spi- nal chord, and nervous branches on the one hand, and the whole of the muscles on the other, were comprehended. Of the simple solids, on the contrary, bone, tooth, cartilage, tendon, and liga- ment were conceived to be examples. This division, which was made at a time when the attention of physicians was more attracted by physical and mathematical, than by physiological and vital pro- perties, may now be safely set aside, while we adopt another which, though less scholastic, is more suited to the nature of living bodies. In the living body, it may be observed, there is no solid which is not alive, and which does not possess vital properties; and there is no vital solid which does not possess all the properties ascribed to the simple solid, or the usual attributes of inanimate matter. The great characteristic of living or organic bodies is, that every substance which enters into their composition possesses not only the usual properties of matter, as weight, cohesion, flexibility, elas- ticity, &c., but also peculiar properties not found in inorganic bo- A

Another variety of the same description of malformation consists in the fistulous openings occasionally effected between the mucous membranes and the cutaneous sur- face by the process of progressive ulceration. To this head be- long the Jistulae of the stomach, of which many examples, from wounds and similar injuries, as well as spontaneous abscesses, are now recorded; the jistulae which result from the ulceration caused by the discharge of gall-stones; artificial anus so frequent after intestinal inflammation, and especially that which attends strangulated hernia; urinary fistulas, whether taking place from I the bladder in the hypogastrium or rectum, or from the urethra; and destruction of the recto-vaginal septum in females, either by laceration or ulceration. These fistulae are covered by a smooth callous membrane so similar in its properties to mucous texture that John Hunter, Meckel, and some other authors think it not an extravagant or gratuitous hypothesis to regard them as examples of the abnormal development of mucous texture. •' —— CHAPTER III. Section I. SEROUS MEMBRANE, TRANSPARENT MEMBRANE ; Membrana pellucida,—M. serosa ;— Tissu Sereux. The pleura and peritonaeum are the best examples of the tissue, which has been named serous, from the fluid with which it is moist- ened, and which may be termed transparent or diaphanous as its distinctive character. The distribution or mechanical arrangement of these membranes is peculiar, and was not well understood by anatomists till Douglas, in 1730,* by his description of the peritonaeum, rendered it clearer * A Description of the Peritoneum, and of that part of the Membrana Cellularis which lies on its outside.

SOFTENING OF THE PANCREAS. 845 g* jland weighed six pounds. The natural weight varies from one ounce and a half to six ounces. In some instances the hypertrophy is only partial, and it then affects chiefly the right side of the pancreas, which may attain the size of the fist, while the left side is natural. (Rahn, cases 4th, 5th, 6th, 11th, 12th.) A common result, then, is pressure upon and obstruction of the common biliary duct, and consequent dis- tension of the gall-bladder, and, if the obstruction^be complete, a jaundiced colour of the surface. Dr Holscher records an instance, in a man of 48, otherwise stout and healthy, in whom the enlargement, by cornpressing the duodenum, caused contraction or stricture of that bowel and fatal ileus The duration of the symptoms of epigastric pain was eight months; but the symptoms of ileus continued not longer than six days. Dissection presented no marks of inflammation. But the nan creas was void of its normal granular condition, soft, succulent, and fleshy; its sections presented neither tubercular matter, nor any formation like scrrhus, or encephaloma; but it was enlarged to the size of a fetal head of four months; and it had so closed the duo- denum for the space of three inches, that the contracted portion did not admit a goose-quill. * ^ This enlargement appears to be of the same nature as that which is observed to affect other secreting glands, as the mamma, the tes- ticle and the liver. In general the individual lobes and acini mav e observed to be perceptibly enlarged; and usually large and nu- merous blood-vessels are observed entering the gland. The on largement seems to depend on additional matter deposited h the interstitial spaces of the acini, and perhaps into thei/substance The case mentioned by De Haen, in which he represents'the pancreas to have degenerated into numerous scirrhous tumours ^ various size, closely cohering to each other, may belone t„ .m head.

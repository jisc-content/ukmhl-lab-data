SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 203 This description, with the alleged cancerous tendency, accords more with the characters of the adipose sarcoma than those of the genuine wen. Personal examination enables me to say, that, in the case of small steatoms of the scalp, eyelids, face, &c. no fibies of this kind are recognised; and to such if any distinction be adopted, the name of lipoma should be confined. In the case of such large steatoms as I have seen in other regions of the body, though the contents are firmly connected together, and some fila- mentous threads may be seen here and there, or the tumour may be even separable into masses, I have not been able to trace the distinct arrangement of cells mentioned by Morgagni and Boyer. Wiedmann mentions, that in one case the matter of steatom was a sort of liquefied fat, and in another firm and dense, and not divid- ed into lobes or cells. The chemical history of steatomatous and lipomatous tumours is imperfectly known. Many years ago Dr Bostock analysed a stearoid tumour without obtaining any precise result. The effects of the agents employed indicated the presence of neither fat, jelly, nor adipocire ; nor was any change accomplished by potass. From its general intractability, however, and the effects produced by sulphuric acid, he infers that it is composed chiefly of carbonaceous matter.* I attempted some years ago to examine the chemical nature of the matter contained in a steatomatous cyst removed from the eye- lids. This matter was of a lemon yellow colour, not absolutely opaque, yet not translucent, and like a mixture of fat and wax. It communicated a stain to paper, and liquefied on exposure to heat. Though it was perfectly soluble in oil of turpentine, I found that no method which I could devise could make it unite with po- tassa. It was also soluble in ether. From the experiments of Chevreul, it is not improbable that they contain stearine, cetine, or adipocire. But it must be admitted, that precise information is still wanting. 6. Lupia. This term, which has been often applied generally to wens, {loupes,) is used in a more limited sense by Plenck, to desig- nate a cyst containing a spongy substance in the cellular tissue, of which it is conceived to be a degenerate form. It is convenient as a head to which certain rare and anomalous cystic tumours may be referred. * Edin. Med. Journal, Vol. II. p. 14 and 17.

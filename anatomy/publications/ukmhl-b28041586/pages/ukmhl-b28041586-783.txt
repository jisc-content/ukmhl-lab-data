761 GLANDULAR TISSUE. 2. Follicles or pedunculated vesicles, a. Solitary, as those of the skin. b. Associated, as the aggregated follicles in the auricular glands of amphibious animals. 3. Elongated bladders, (utricui.i elongati,) sacs, or caeca. This glandular apparatus consists in the eversion of a simple membrane, which is prolonged without contraction or terminal enlargement. These are either, a. simple intestinula, occurring in the mucous membranes, or b. aggregated intestinula, like the Meibomian glands of mammalia, and the glands of the stomach of birds. 4. Tubtjli or blind sacs ; (caeca.) These are either, a. solitary tubules, as the secretory organs of several insects ; or b. Aggregated tubules, as the glands of the oviducts of the ray and shark, consisting of parallel tu- buli, the oesophageal glands in certain birds, and the pyloric appendages of some fishes. II. Glands of the second order. Compound Crypts. Fol- licles. Intestinules. Compound tubules. 1. Compound crypts, or compound cells, in which several crypts are united. a. Berry-like crypts, as in the anal glands of the hyena. b. Bladders with cells, (cryptae loculatae,) as in the pre- putial glands of the dormouse. c. Tubules with internal cells, as the salivary glands of some insects. d. Flower-like crypts, or crypts united as flowers, as in the testicles of insects. 2. Compound follicles, or compound pedunculated vesi- cles. Follicles united in various modes. 3. Compound caeca. Intestinal caca united in various modes 4. Tubuli composite Tubules or hollow cylinders united in various modes. 111. Glands of the third order ; compound cells, follicles Intestinules. Compound Tubules united so as to form one glandular sac. ^sro^™8 °F ™E r0OT™ 0IiI>EI,• composed of SPONGY CELLULAR texture, variously arranged ; sometimes in

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 167 the phenomena of morbid enlargements and preternatural growths. Every instance of unusual or anormal size is of three kinds. a. A texture or organ becomes enlarged in consequence of a uniform increase of its proper organic substance. Thus the heart becomes thicker, firmer, and larger in all its dimensions. Its mus- cular substance, and perhaps the intermuscular filamentous tissue, are actually augmented. They are redder, firmer, and contain more blood than natural; and their blood-vessels are increased in size and number. The bladder in like manner undergoes the same change; and in its thickened and indurated tissue also dissection shows a more copious supply of blood, and a more abundant distri- bution of vessels than in the natural state. Of this preternatural increase of bulk and density the capillaries of the organs are the sole agents. In some instances this hyper- trophy appears to be of the nature of a chronic process of inflam- mation. This is exemplified in the case of the liver, the testicle, the prostate gland, the female breast, and even the heart. /3. Any individual texture may undergo a preternatural or anor- mal enlargement by local deposition of matter similar to itself. Thus a bone may become enlarged, as in exostosis; a gland may become enlarged, as in various instances the testicle and the female breast do. That the skin is liable to a particular species of hyper- trophic augmentation is well ascertained from cases given by many authors, but especially from one recorded by Mr John Bell.* In mucous membrane, lymphatic gland, and secreting glands, similar local augmentations take place. 7. In any tissue or organ a deposition of new matter altogether foreign to that tissue may take place. This new matter may be either similar to that of some natural tissue of the animal body; for example, it may be serous membrane, or bone, or cartilage; or of a nature entirely dissimilar, and never seen unless in the mor- bid state; for instance, the several varieties of tubercular deposi- tion of scirrhous deposition, of fungoid deposition, and several of the forms of sarcoma enumerated by Mr Abernethy. In whatever mode these new productions vary in intimate struc- ture, all agree in being connected with more or less augmented development of the capillary system. In many the growth, if not the origin, can be traced to the increased number, or at least en- larged size, of the capillary arteries. In most of these tumours * Principles of Surgery, Vol. III.

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 147 of a thin membrane, which afterwards assumes the appeal ance and properties of skin, the last part of the process is called skinning 01 cicatrization,â€”the formation of a scar. The nature and mechanism of this process will be considered in its proper place. Granulation may he viewed as the means which the several tis- sues of the human body possess of reproducing themselves, or re- pairing those losses of substance which result from direct injury, or take place in consequence of disease. Of this process the capilla- ries of the texture are the agents. But it is uncertain to what ex- tent they possess the power of reproducing the same sort of sub- stance as that of the texture destroyed. The kind of matter which is most generally reproduced is filamentous or cellular tissue. It is certain also that bone is reproduced. But it is uncertain whe- ther skin, that is true skin, muscle, tendon, or ligament, is repro- duced, and almost certain that cartilage is not. 5. Different effects of inflammation. I have said that granula- tion is in general accompanied with the formation of more or less purulent matter. This process, which is termed suppuration, ge- nerally precedes that of granulation. It has been viewed at one time as a consequence or effect of inflammation, at another as a character of it, and at a third as a cause. The circumstances which justify these distinctions should be understood. Inflammation is a progressive process, which tends through cer- tain stages to a certain termination. Of the intermediate steps not much is known with certainty ; and pathological writers have dis- tinguished chiefly the different modes in which it may terminate. These are resolution, effusion, adhesion, suppuration, granulation, ulceration, cicatrization, induration, and gangrene. This division is more scholastic than natural. The first only can be justly de- nominated a termination. All the others are to be regarded as effects either immediate or remote of the process. a. Resolution is that action in which the redness, pain, heat, and swelling of an inflamed part gradually disappear, either spontane- ously or under the use of means, witli or without sensible evacua- tion, and in which the part, which had been inflamed, resumes by degrees its natural state, without suffering derangement of structure or properties. This is exceedingly rare. The minute veins are doubtless the great agents of cure in such circumstances. /3. In most cases of inflammation more or less fluid is early effus- ed or extravasated from the capillaries or the exhalants of the part. i

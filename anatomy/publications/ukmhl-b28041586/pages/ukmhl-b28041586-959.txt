937 SUPPURATION OF THE KIDNEY. lent or suppurative inflammation of the fine mucous membrane of the pelvis and infundibula, and consequent distension of the renal tubular cones, but without destruction of their substance. It should never be forgotten, that the presence of a urinary concretion in the pelvis or ureter may cause inflammation and suppuration without that suppuration affecting the proper substance of the kidney; and that suppuration of the kidney may take place without the presence of a concretion in the pelvis, or ureter, or any of the inf undibula. If the stone be by any means expelled and carried into the bladder, the purulent matter may also escape, and after being discharged, the kidney may contract, and the morbid secretion may cease. Hence it is found that discharges of purulent urine may take place for some time, and eventually cease, without preventing the patient from recovering temporarily. More frequently, however, the reverse is the case. Though the calculus may be discharged, the purulent matter may not be eva- cuated, or the purulent inflammation continues; and even the stone itself, forming a sort of cyst of the pelvis or ureter, may remain rmly impacted, and prevent the issue either of urine or purulent matter. In either case, the expansion of the kidney (.Nephrotasia) continues and increases; the tubular cones are distended, com- pressed and extruded; the papilla are compressed, flattened, and a most obliterated; the cortical covering is also distended and ex- tenuated; and the exquisite stage of the lesion already described as Nephropyema (.Pyonephria) is fully established. Even ulcera- tion of the parts around the concretion, wherever it happens to be fixed, may take place, and give rise to great and irreparable ra- vages m the renal tissue, and that of the contiguous organs. Jo It is not uninteresting to trace the subsequent progress of this disorder, and to observe what singular and extraordinary efforts are sometimes made to counteract the mischief in the kidneys, and effects of the t0 ^ ^ “ mon!tntj!ffCrem ‘ermi,Mti0n6 in of the disorder be f m:nati0" rTir“S ™«°e is, that the disease may pass ,nt° the chronic state, m which the inflammatory process in - *

general and pathological anatomy. 548 markably in different individuals, Bichat represents as depending on a total death of the piliparous sacs. Accidental and abnormal developement of hairs is not uncom- mon. In the skin this appears in the shape of hairy moles and similar congenital marks.* Their occurrence in the stomach, in- testines, and bladder, as noticed by a variety of authors, is also to be regarded as abnormal. Lastly, the accidental developement of hairs is observed in encysted tumours, especially those of the ovaries, in which masses or balls of hair mixed with fat, oleaginous, or adi- pocirous matter, have been frequently found.f On the mode in which these hairs are formed nothing satisfactory is known.;£ CHAPTER II.

The organic tissue or membrane, to which the name of mucous or villous has been applied, consists of two great divisions, the gas- tro-pulmonary, and genito-urinary. A. The first or gastro-pulmonary mucous surface comprehends that membranous surface which commences at the various orifices of the face, at which it is contiguous with the skin ; and is continu- ed through the lacrymal and nasal passages, and even the Eusta- chian tube, by the larynx on the one hand to the windpipe and bronchial membrane, and by the oesophagus on the other through the entire tract of the alimentary canal, at the opposite extremity of which, it is again identified with the skin. B. The distribution of the second division, or the genito-urinary mucous membrane, is slightly varied according to the differences of sex. In the male it is connected with the skin at the orifice of the urethra, from which it proceeds inwards toward the bladder; * Haller, Elementa Physiologia;, Lib. XII. Sect I. § XVII. f Bichat, Tom.

GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 596 incessant change of air in the bronchial tubes and vesicles of the lungs, interferes with the necessary changes in the blood of the pulmonary artery and veins, which, therefore, passes from the former vessel into the latter, much less completely aerated than it would he in the healthy state. In addition to this, as the motion of the blood through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary veins is always more free, in proportion as the expansion of the lung by in- spiration, and its collapse by expiration, is extensive ; and as both the obstruction of the bronchial tubes by viscid mucus, and the swelled and congested state of the bronchial membrane and sub- mucous tissue, prevent the branches of the artery and veins from freely expanding themselves; the motion of the blood through this order of vessels begins to be interrupted and retarded, and thus to induce a congested state of the whole pulmonary system, which not only adds to the dyspnoea and orthopncea of such patients, but even- tually terminates in dropsical effusion into the pulmonic filamentous tissue, within the cavity of the pleura, and even into the general cel- lular membrane. The pulmonic filamentous tissue is in general the first seat of this dropsical infiltration; and it is one of the most common changes recognized in inspecting the lungs of persons cut off by long-continued bronchial inflammation. Chronic bronchial inflammation, further, by its influence in im- peding respiration and the circulation of the pulmonary artery and veins, has an indirect tendency to induce disease of the heart. In consequence of the difficulty which the blood encounters in passing through the branches of the pulmonary artery, the trunk of that vessel becomes permanently distended ; and the right ventricle, being also distended and incessantly excited to new contractions, becomes affected with hypertrophy, sometimes with dilatation, some- times without; and in other cases it may be merely enlarged with extenuation of its walls. It is, I conceive, in consequence of the union of the two ventricles in the human subject, that this exces- sive distension and inordinate action, by being first confined to the right ventricle, gives rise to a similar inordinate action in the left ventricle, that the latter is often found in a state of hypertrophy in persons who have long laboured under chronic bronchial disease. The fact of the connection is at least well-established; and hos- pital practice presents few instances of bronchial disease in which the heart is not affected ; and in most of the cases of disease of the heart, the bronchial membrane and pulmonic tissue are previously affected.

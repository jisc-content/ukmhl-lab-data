MORBID STATES OF THE HEART.—PULMONARY ARTERY. 1049 Tiie 01^ce ?f the pulmonary artery is liable to three forms of lesion The first is an unusually contracted or narrow state of the cylinder of the artery, the capacity of which may be not half its normal size, or at most between that and three-fourths. A second is narrowing sometimes obstruction even to obliteration of the channel „f the artery. This is usually accompanied with, if not caused by, more or less thickening of the arterial walls, and may rior of°7am , ?°me eff“sion of lj,roPh or w»°d '» H>c inte- le vessel at the part.

BOOK II. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. The nervous system of the animal body includes, according to the most rational views, two general divisions. The first of these is collected in a single and indivisible mass, and contained in a pe- culiar cavity, formed by part of the osseous system of the animal. In the less perfect tribes this is limited to the vertebral column, or something analogous to it; but in man, and the more perfect ani- mals, we find a large cavity at the superior extremity of this column superadded. The second division of the nervous system is found in the form of long chords or threads mutually connected, and running in various directions through the body in the mode of ra- mification. To these the name of nervous trunks or chords, or simply nerves, has been long applied. CHAPTER I. A. The Central Part of the Nervous System. Section I.

Of all the works which have been composed on the anatomy of the brain, the subjects may be referred to two general heads;— those which treat of the configuration of the organ, and those which undertake to investigate its minute structure. The authors them- selves, however, do not always distinguish accurately between these two departments of anatomical science. As it is chiefly the latter which is to occupy attention at present, I may mention, that after the epistle of Varoli on the base of the brain and the origin of the optic nerves, the writings of Willis, Malpighi, and Vieussens, are

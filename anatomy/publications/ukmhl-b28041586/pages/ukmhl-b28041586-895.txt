PATHOLOGY OF METASTATIC ABSCESS OF THE LIVER. 873 causing inflammation of the osseous tissue, and involving the veins of that tissue, are very commonly followed by abscess in the liver. Ihe veins so affected may be so minute as to escape notice ; and hence the errors and misconceptions that have so long prevailed on this subject. The experience of the three days of July 1830, which furnished many cases of gun-shot wounds and injuries of bones, con- tributed to throw light on this mystery. It was then found, that, in some cases, injuries and fractures of the cranium, in other in- stances, compound fractures of the bones of the extremities, were followed by purulent collections within the liver ; and always almost was it found, that the veins of the fractured and subsequently in- flamed bone were inflamed, add contained purulent matter. The veins of bones, it must be observed, allow this species of suppuration and deposit within the liver more easily than the veins of other tissues; because, being contained within incompressible canals they do not collapse, and remaining open, they are more likely to become inflamed than the veins of other textures Though inflammation and suppuration in the minute'veins of bones may he generally requisite, in order to be followed by second ary purulent collections, yet probably it is not requisite that this inflammation extend far up within the venous trunks arising from these minute veins Even it may happen, that inflammation and suppuration of the inner venous coat may not be requisite; and that the veins act as the mere carriers from the inflamed tissue t,Vn >h TOm a;erI rem0te Period observed that suppura- .on within the liver after injuries of the head is a most in idious affection and takes place with very imperceptible external infa turns of its presence; and most probably this is to be ascribed to the circumstance either that it is a peculiarly chronic and insIZs process, or that it consists merely in the successive transport of purulent matter by the veins from f|10 * transport of matter is formed.

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C, 163 organ may be completely impaired, those of others remain un- altered. In fever, on the contrary, the capillaries of all the tissues and of every organ are affected ; and while no individual organ is much affected at the commencement, eveiâ€™y organ suffers a little in the general disorder of the capillary system. 5th, Inflammation gives rise to albuminous exudation, suppuration, ulceration, and in certain parts to serous or sero-purulent effusion. In fever the morbid state of the capillaries terminates in complete destruction or disorganization of their organic extremities, and the consequent oozing of blood from the surface of the several membranes and or- gans. In conclusion, though it may be regarded as established, that during the morbid process of fever the whole capillary system is unduly distended and loaded with an inordinate quantity of blood, which really moves more slowly and imperfectly than during health, we have no facts which enable us to determine what induces this peculiar and excessive accumulation. Much has been lately said of congestion, and especially venous congestion. The state of the capillary system which I have attempted to describe is that of con- gestion or accumulation; and so far the hypothesis of congestion is intelligible. Of the existence of venous congestion, however, unless as an effect of that in the capillary vessels, there is neither proof nor probability. It is not a primary but a secondary, or rather remote consequence. (Marsh.) v- Changes in the blood in Fever. (Hcematopathia.) An- other question belonging to a different head, nevertheless, in this place may deserve some consideration in explaining this uni- versal affection of the vascular system. This is the state of the blood itself, and to what extent and in what manner it influences the formation of these phenomena of deranged action in the vascu- lar system. Though this has been already in part noticed under the head of the blood, yet it may render the pathological views on fever more complete and more intelligible to advert shortly to certain facts on the subject in this place, and the necessary infe- rences from these facts. All observers agree in representing the blood to be more or less changed in its properties and constitution in the different varieties of fever, whether intermittent, remittent, or continued. To the princi- pal views of the old pathologists it is unnecessary to advert. But by all observers during the 18th century, when it was supposed import-

In certain tissues, especially that of the lungs, and perhaps that of the brain occasionally, softening is analogous to mortification of other tissues. In the brain, however, it is most usually analogous to suppuration. One variety of softening is often observed in parts or new struc- tures, originally hard, and consists not so much in the process now mentioned, as in the slow solution or liquefaction of the tissue or substance, partly by disruption of its particles, partly by death of their individual atoms, with the admixture of blood, serous or sero- purulent fluid. This softening, which takes place in encysted tu- mours, tyromatous or scirrhous tubercles, and in most ot the ad- ventitious tissues, is a spurious variety of suppuration. £. Induration (>Scleroma, Verhartung), or preternatural firm- ness, is a usual concomitant and effect of the process of inflamma- tion. The process rarely, indeed, exists for a few hours or days in any tissue without rendering it considerably harder and moi’e resisting than natural. In the external parts of the body this is seen in inflammation of the skin and filamentous tissue, in which the inflamed parts are much harder and firmer than natural; and every inflammation of the filamentous tissue is accompanied with hardness more or less extensive. This hardness, which is also ac- companied with swelling and enlargement, depends partly on the excessive distension of vessels by blood, and partly on the effusion of sero-albuminous fluid. The latter circumstance explains the presence of induration as a consequence of the inflammatory process. The sero-albuminous fluid, though first, when effused, liquid, and homogeneous, is speedily separated by virtue of its property of spontaneous coagu- lation into two parts,—the serous, liquid, or non-coagulable, and the albuminous, consistent, or coagulable. The former is the cause of the oedematous swelling already mentioned as often ac- companying inflammation, and, after remaining for some time in the interstices of the filamentous tissue of the part, may be removed by the absorbent property of the capillaries and minute veins. The latter, in the form of minute amorphous masses, disposed be- tween the filamentous fibres, or the component atoms of the tissue, augments its volume, and the space which it occupies, agglutinates contiguous parts, and, eventually contracting and becoming con- solidated, increases much the natural consistence and density of the tissue in which it has been deposited. In this manner induration

SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 195 The cause of this accumulation and consequent exudation is not known. To assert, as Bichat has done, that a change in the or- ganic sensibility of the exhalants opens a passge through them to are unchanged blood, is- to describe the fact in a different mode without explaining its reason. The hemorrhagic effort of Stahl, and the error loci of Boerhaave, are equally true and not less in- telligible. 0. In the recrementitial exhalants, and first in those of transpa- rent or serous membranes, though less frequently, the same anor- mal condition may be often recognised. In the pleura or the pe- ricardium, and in the peritoneum, it is not unusual to find bloody fluids of various tints, evidently the result of exhalation. The fluid effused may be simply bloody serum if little blood is exhaled, very red if more is poured forth, or even, as I shall show afterwards, it may be pure blood. In several of the cases in which blood is found in the ventricles of the brain, it cannot be traced to any other source save the exhalants of the choroid plexus; and blood may be shown to be effused occasionally from the outer division of the arachnoid membrane, and also from that which covers the spinal chord. In each of these cases, whether the fluid is merely sanguinolent or is pure blood, it issues from the same vessels which, in the healthy state of the membrane, prepare its proper secretions. No rupture or breach can be recognised by the most accurate scrutiny. Bichat is disposed to view the sanguinolent effusions as the effect of inflammation, acute or chronic, or like dropsy, as the consequence of organic disease. The few cases hitherto accurately recorded show, that, whatever be the remote cause, the state of the capilla- ries of the serous membranes is much the same as those of mucous surfaces under similar circumstances. I formerly spoke of hemorrhage occurring in cellular membrane. The blood is in this case derived from the exhalants of that tissue exactly as it issues from those of the serous membranes. As an active hemorrhage, it is not unfrequent in severe phlegmon, and in the bloody abscess, as it is named, with which the practical surgeon is familiar. As a passive hemorrhage, it occurs in land-scurvy and in sea-scurvy. In some instances the synovial membranes, both in joints and in the tendinous sheaths, are found to contain blood or bloody fluid, which must have issued from their exhalant arteries. 5. Elephantia. Another example still of disease to be referred to the head of anormal exhalation, is presented in the unshapely

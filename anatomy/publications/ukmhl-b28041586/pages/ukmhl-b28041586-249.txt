227 ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE. nutrition. To changes in one or other of these two circumstances almost all morbid actions which become the subject of pathological anatomy may be referred; under the two general divisions, Is?, of changes in organization; and, 2d, changes in nutritious deposition, or intimate structure. It is unnecessary to render this division more complex, by ad- mitting, as has been done by several pathological writers, a third head in the changes which take place in the process of secretion. That process is to be viewed in general, nay, in almost all circum- stances, as a complementary effect of nutrition; and the morbid changes which it occasionally undergoes may, without violence, be referred to one or other of the two foregoing heads. It is different, however, with a third form or source of disease. I allude to those errors in the formation and relative situation of parts, especially the integrant parts of organs, which have been termed malformations, (Missbildungen.) These have been shown by Oken, Meckel, and others, to depend on the accidental inter- ruption of'the process of development, and misapplication of the component parts of organs during the early stage of that process. In the subsequent chapters of this work, though it is unnecessary to abandon the simple arrangement hitherto observed, the morbid changes incident to the several textures shall be enumerated in re- ference to the two first distinctions,â€”those in minute organization and its products, and those in nutrition and intimate structure. The various forms of malformation constitute a distinct family by themselves.

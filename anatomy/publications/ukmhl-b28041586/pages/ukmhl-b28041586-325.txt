There is reason to believe, that the fulness resides as much in the arteries as in the veins. It is manifest also that the main cause of this venous plethora in advanced life, viz. the frequency of disease of the heart, especially its mitral valve, and of the aortic valves, Cullen altogether overlooked. Of the effect and reality of arterial disease I have already spoken. In point of fact, cases of apoplexy occur at all ages, but are most frequent between the 50th and the 65th, or 70th year. Willan in- forms us he has seen young persons from 12 to 18 years of age affected with apoplexy and hemiplegia. In Bonetus and Morgagni, instances of apoplexy are found occurring in persons below the age of 30 ; but in general they were induced by external violence or organic diseases. I have seen an instance of cerebral hemorrhage terminating in hemiplegy in a young man of 19, labouring under disease of the left auriculo-ventricular orifice. The young woman to whose case I have already alluded, was, I think, about 22; and in general when the disease takes place between 18 and 30, it is in consequence of disease of the heart or its valves, or of the aorta. Of eighteen cases described by Bonetus, five occurred in persons above 60, and six in persons below 40. Morgagni relates the cases of thirty apoplectic persons, seventeen of whom were above the age of 60, and five below that of 40. Of thirty-one cases of bloody ex- travasation in the ventricles or the substance of the brain, recorded by Lieutaud, one was at the age of 25, eight between the ages of 30 and 41, eleven between 41 and 51, six between 51 and 61, two between 61 and 71, two between 71 and 81, and one only above 100. Of twenty-nine cases seen or dissected by Portal, two were between 19 and 23, four between 30 and 41, seven between 41 and 51, eight between 51 and 61, four between 61 and 71, and the same number between 71 and 81. Of 6 cases of cerebral hemor- rhage given by Cheyne, three were between 30 and 35, two at 50, and one at 63. Rochoux, however, has given the fullest and most accurate results on this point. Among sixty-three cases of apo- plexy, two occurred between the age of 20 and 30, eight between that of 30 and 60, seven between that of 40 and 50, ten between that of 50 and 50, twenty-three between that of 60 and 70, twelve between that of 70 and 80, and only one between that of 80 and 90. According to this view apoplexy is extremely rare before the 30th year ; from that period to the 50th it is not common but may

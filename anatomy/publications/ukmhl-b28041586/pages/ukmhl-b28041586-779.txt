A gland may be defined to be an organ, or organized texture, consisting of blood-vessels and nerves ; the blood-vessels very nume- rous, arranged in a particular manner, and communicating with a series of sacculated cavities, vesicles, or hollow tubes; intended for the purpose of receiving or preparing from the blood, or secreting, a substance of peculiar properties, either to be applied to some pur- pose within or without the economy, or to be conveyed entirely out of the system. According to the terms of this definition, the denomination gland comprehends only the secreting or conglomerate glands, or those organs which are known to secrete some substance, generally liquid, and to deposit the same in cavities communicating with an emissary duct or ducts. These are by various authors denominated perfect glands. Ly imperfect glands the same authors understand organs with apparent glandular structure, but without visible secreting appa- ratus, secreted product, or excretory duct, as the thymus gland in the infant, the thyroid gland, and according to some the spleen. It is evidentthatthe term imperfect gland is equivalent to thatof no gland Some anatomists, guided by physiological and in a certain sense transcendental considerations, have proposed to add to the order of glands, the lungs, because they separate or secrete carbonaceous matter from the blood; and many have in this manner classed the lungs with the liver and the kidneys under the head of emunctory or excreting organs.

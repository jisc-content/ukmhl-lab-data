SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 193 bercles of the lungs, chronic inflammation of the hi onchial mem- brane, ossification, cancer, tubercles, and other morbid changes in the pleura, produce a symptomatic water within the chest. And in dysentery, tubercular disease of the peritoneum, and enlaigement of the mesenteric glands, (tabes rnesenterica), symptomatic ascites is a very frequent occurrence. 2. Unusual increase of exhalation may take place in the syno- vial membranes, either articular or tendinous. In the former case it constitutes one form of disease of the joints, to which perhaps the name of hydrarthrus ought to be restricted. To this head also be- longs the effusion which takes place in articular rheumatism and in synovial rheumatism. In the latter, inordinate exhalation produ- cing effusion forms the elastic hemispheroidal tumour known under the denomination of ganglion. 3. Diminution of exhalation is rare, unless in consequence of an unnatural augmentation of it elsewhere. 4. Hemorrhage. The only example of complete change of ex- halation is that termed by Bichat preternatural exhalations, and the most common of these is when the matter exhaled consists not of the usual watery fluid, but of pure blood, constituting several forms of the disease termed hemorrhage. This bloody exhalation may hike place either in the exhalations termed excrementitial, or in those termed recrementitiah a. To the first head are to be referred those hemorrhages from the skin which are sometimes observed, and those from mucous membranes, which are very frequent, during congestion of their ca- pillary system. In the lungs for example, nothing is more com- mon than exudation of blood from the bronchial membrane during catarrh or bronchial inflammation. In such circumstances it is ge- nerally small in quantity, (hcemoptoe,) and unlike the copious and irresistible discharge of pulmonary apoplexy. It is still more distinct in haemoptysis, in which considerable quan- tities of blood issue from the surface of the bronchial membrane without breach or laceration, and consequently from the orifices of vessels by a process analogous to exhalation. (Bichat.) Is it also by exhalation that the copious discharge of pulmonary apoplexy takes place ? On this point facts are wanting. In hemorrhage from any point of the gastro-intestinal membrane the blood is exhaled in the same manner. The researches of Por- N

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 131 These concretions, which in other respects are very impel fectly known, have been termed vein-stones. (Phlebolites.) CHAPTER VII. % SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, TERMINATIONS OF ARTERIES, ORIGINS OF VEINS. Section I. Though we can scarcely, with propriety, speak of the capillary tissue, or the tissue of capillary vessels, we find it requisite to intro- duce in this place the general facts of the anatomical peculiarities of this important part of the human body. The term capillary system, though much spoken of in physiolo- gical and pathological writings, is perhaps not always precisely de- fined or distinctly understood. According to Bichat it is not only the common intermediate system between the arteries and veins, but the origin of all the exhalant and excreting vessels.* If we consider the modes in which arteries have been said to terminate, and veins to take their origin, we shall find, that in this view of the capillary system there are some things which are doubtful, and some which are inconsistent with the rest. Haller, and most of the physiological authorities since his time, concluded, chiefly from the phenomena of injections, sometimes from microscopical observation, and where these failed, from the obscure and uncertain evidence of analogy, that an artery traced to its last or minute divisions will be found to terminate in one or other of the following modes. Is*, Either directly in a red vein or veins; 2d, in excreting ducts, as in the lacrymal and salivary glands, the kidney, liver, and pancreas, the female breast, and the testicle of the male; 3cl, in exhalants, as in the skin, in the membranes of cavities, (serous membranes,) the cavities of the brain, the cham- bers of the eye, the filamentous tissue, the adipose cells, the pulmo- nary vesicles, and mucous surfaces and their follicular glands; 4th, in smaller vessels, for instance lymphatics; and, 5th, in the colour- less artery; (axterm non rubra.)] * Anat.

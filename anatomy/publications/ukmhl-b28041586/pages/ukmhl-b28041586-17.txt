advertisement. In preparing the present Edition all the materials of the first have been employed. But they have been greatly increased by the introduction of new matter under the proper heads, in order to carry forward to the present time the information acquired since the appearance of the first edition. Numerous rectifications, both in healthy and morbid anatomy, have also been made. Besides the changes now mentioned, two new books have been added; one on the Structure and Morbid States of the Glands ; the other on the Structure and Morbid States of the Lungs and Heart. The object of the author throughout the volume has been to communicate precise and useful information in a perspicuous and methodical manner. Of the difficulties attending the undertaking he is fully aware; and it is possible, that, after all endeavours to render the work perfect, it may still present defects. In a subject so extensive and complicated as morbid anatomy, and which is cul- tivated by so many assiduous inquirers, the difficulty of presenting the most recent views must always be great. This, however, the author has studied to do, so far as the limits of the work permit. Novelty, however, is not the only object which the author of a work on pathological anatomy should keep in view. His great object must be to furnish correct statements and useful information on the nature and distinctive characters of diseases. On this ac- count the author has adhered, as formerly, to the principle of j udi- cious selection.

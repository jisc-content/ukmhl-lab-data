584 GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMT. navy consumption. It is, indeed, remarkable that, in all the re- corded cases, the symptoms thus produced have borne so close a resemblance to phthisis, that they have in most instances been con- sidered as examples of consumptive disease, and by several they are described as such. The bodies which have in this manner been known to drop into the windpipe are various; beans,* nuts,f walnuts,J cherry stones,§ plumb stones,|| an iron nail,t a leaden shot,** teeth, natural and artificial,ff ears of grass,fragments of bones, a fragment of nut- meg,§§ pieces of money,|||| and similar substances. Of various pointed and well authenticated examples of this accident and its effects, I published in 1834 a collection, with the view of showing the true nature and effects of the lesion and its degree of frequency; and the most instructive mode of presenting the results of this series of eases, I believe to be placing them in the tabular form which is here subjoined. This list I might have enlarged more than I have done. But I believe that the present table gives a sufficient number of well established and accurately detailed facts to enable the reader to form just ideas on the nature of the disorder, and to compare the facts with the inferences deduced. * Boussier de la Bouchardiere.

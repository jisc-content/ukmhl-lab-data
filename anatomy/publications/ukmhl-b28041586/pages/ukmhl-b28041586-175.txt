SYSTEM OE CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 153 and as this must be understood to be effected by the vessels of the part, the chief objection with which this opinion can be charged, is, that not only the lymphatics, but the minute veins must be con- cerned in the process of resumption. I do not propose here to consider all the various forms of ulce- ration, or the circumstances under which it may take place. Lut I shall mention a few by way of example. Ulceration occurs in the skin in consequence of inflammation from injury, as wound, tear, burn, &c., death of a part occasioned either by mortification, or by the cautery, actual or potential, or the application of a morbid poison. Ulceration occurs in the mucous membranes under the same circumstances as in the skin, and also after spontaneous inflamma- tion, that is, inflammation coming on without manifest cause. Ulceration occurs in the cellular tissue in consequence of the pressure and progressive advancement of a large abscess, in conse- quence of the presence of foreign bodies, as bullets, sword-points, pins, &c.; or the sharp end of a bone. Ulceration is not common in serous membranes. In these, how- ever, it takes place in consequence of the continued pressure of large collections of matter. This is seen in empyema and collec- tions of purulent matter in the peritonaeum. Ulceration occurs in bone either spontaneously, or in conse- quence of the death of part of it. The former is seen in caries, the latter in necrosis and exfoliation. Ulceration occurs in cartilage in consequence of inflammation. This is seen in diseases of the knee-joint and hip-joint. In all cases of ulceration, the capillaries of the parts are larger and more numerous than natural, and certainly contain more blood than in the state of health. This is seen very well in the case of ulcers of the cornea, which are invariably surrounded by an annu- lar net-work of small vessels, which in the sound state of that tex- ture are invisible. In tbe skin it is very well established by inci- sions made in the treatment of boil and carbuncle. In both cases, if the incision be carried through either tumour, much more blood is discharged from the point where ulceration is established than at any other part. The same fact is demonstrated by the appearance of ulcerated patches of the intestinal mucous membrane. In the process of ulceration it is generally possible to trace a final intention or definite purpose, after the accomplishment of

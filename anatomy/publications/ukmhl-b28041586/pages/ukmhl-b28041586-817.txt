STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL GLANDS—MALPIGHIAN BODIES. 795 the capsule. He further denies that the uriniferous ducts terminate in shut ends in the capsule. These ducts or tubules form collars, and what has been taken for shut ends of ducts, are nothing but the capsules, which communicate with the same by means of a short neck, which is evidently thinner than the uriniferous duct. The capsule is not a blind termination of a uriniferous duct, but a re- traction or introversion,—a diverticulum of the same structureless membrane which forms the uriniferous tubes. Gerlach admits that the account given by IVXr Bowman of the perforation of the capsule by the arteries is correct. As to the point at which the capsule is perforated by the affer- ent and effeient vessels, Gerlach thinks that the statement of Mr Bowman is too exclusive, when he represents this point to be al- ways opposite to the opening of the uriniferous tube into the capsule He gives a figure, (fig. 12,) which shows that the point, at which the afferent and efferent vessels perforate the capsule does not always correspond to the point of communication between the uri- niferous ducts and the capsule. The point in Mr Bowman’s statements, which has been most strongly controverted both by Reicher and Huschke, is that as to the free entrance of the Malpighian capillary net-work into the cavity of the capsule; and both justly remark that such an as- sumption is at variance with all experience hitherto collected on the laws of histological organization; there being no example yet known of vessels lying immediately in the cavity of a secreting tis- sue In truth, the representation of Mr Bowman, that the water ol the urine is separated from the blood flowing in the Malpighian capillary vessels by simple transudation alone, while the peculiar constituents ot the urine are separated through cells at the inner surface ol the uriniferous ducts, Gerlach regards as in every respect a rash statement, and to be corroborated by no other fact. On the other hand, all investigations on glands prove, that in the process of secretion, cells are the essential element; and in the presen state of science, ,t is impossible to think of secretion withou He further adds, that when thp MnlmVu- is Closely examined after the calfe h f ^ 7 net'WOrk from it/wosee it in’its whole exZttve^d bTa Si f S" cleated cells, which are continued from the innet n V' V " upon the Malpighian vessels; and thelatterlieTintroverted wRhhi a

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 159 ■■■■ receive from, the aorta, blood which has not been sufficiently aite- rialized. y. In the capillary system of the chylopoietic and assistant chylo- poietic viscera traces of the same condition may he recognized, both from the symptoms during life and the appearances after death. In these organs two capillary systems may be distinguished, a pri- mary and a secondary one. The primary is that which consists of the ultimate divisions of the splenic, gastric, and duodenal arteries, and of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, and their cor- responding veins, which afterwards terminate in the splenic and superior and inferior mesenteric veins. The secondary capillary system is that which results from the union of the minute extremi- ties of the portal vein, and of the hepatic artery with those of the vence caves hepatiecc. It is unnecessary to dwell on the proofs of the loaded state of the capillary system of the alimentary canal. It is sufficient to remind the student that the furred or brown tongue, the thirst, the sense of internal heat, the loathing, squeamishness, and sometimes sickness, with weight, oppression, and tenderness of the epigastric region, sufficiently demonstrate the morbid state of the capillaries of the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum ; while the constipa- tion of the bowels at the commencement, insensibility to cathartic medicine throughout, and occasional looseness at the conclusion, indicate the deranged condition of those of the intestines. After death the minute vessels of the whole of these parts are found much distended with blood, generally dark-coloured. (Hamilton, Mills, Bateman, Percival, &c.) In one form of fever, the abdominal or intestinal typhus, the ileum and its mucous follicles, are very much affected. The follicles be- come enlarged, elevated, and prominent, and swelled in consequence of their proper tissue being attacked, and perhaps their secreting pores being obstructed. The apices become dead, and are thrown off in the form of sloughs; and in their place are left small ulcers, which in no long time enlarge, spread, and increase in depth. These changes may take place either in the isolated follicles or in the ag- gregated patches, or in both orders of glands. They shall be con- sidered more fully under the proper head. ' In certain forms of fever there are pain, distension, and uneasy sensations in the right iliac region; and when percussion is em- ployed, the sound emitted is dull, while a peculiar croaking noise

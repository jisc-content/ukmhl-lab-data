Since the time of Dr Crampton, many instances of different de- grees of induration of the pancreas, sometimes alone, more com- monly along with affections of the duodenum or other abdominal organs, have been recorded by Dr Heineken, Dr Bright, Dr Wil- son, Dr Ilolscher, Dr Ritter, Dr Landsberg, and other observers, all of which tend to show that induration of the pancreas is not a very uncommon disease; and that this induration, though usually denominated scirrhus, is either the effect of inflammation or accom- panies that process. From the cases recorded by these authors, it results that, though induration may affect any part of the pancreas, or the whole of that gland, yet most usually it is the head of the organ, that is in- durated ; and at the same time it may be enlarged. The pancreatic substance is then hard and cuts firm, grating on the knife. In some cases it is stated to be like cartilage; in others like the boiled udder of the cow. Usually there are adhesions or recent lymph connecting the pancreas to other adjoining parts. The ta- bulated acinoid structure is not always very manifest. Ritter * Compendium of Medical Practice.

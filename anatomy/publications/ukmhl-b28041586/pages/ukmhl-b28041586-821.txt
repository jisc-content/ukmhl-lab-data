STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL GLANDS—MALPIGHIAN BODIES. 799 ciency appears to depend on this circumstance, that from the con- tiguous uriniferous tubes entire epithelium cells or their fragments are thrust by the pressure of the covering glass plates into the ca- vity, and the correct view in the same is destroyed. The original transparency of these cells is frequently lost before the eyes of the observer; and there is thus sufficient opportunity to observe imme- diately the cause here specified. Opposite the entrance-spot of the uriniferous tube into that ex- pansion, or on one side of the latter when it is connected with two tubes, the Malpighian vascular tuft enters the uriniferous tube, and advances to a greater or less depth in the expanded portion itself; so that sometimes it fills the half of the cavity, sometimes it occupies a much smaller part of it. As to the statement that the glomerulus perforates the wall of the uriniferous tube, lies un- covered and free in this cavity, and is immersed in the fluid of the same, it must be indeed admitted, that the microscopical image on superficial examination appears frequently to agree with this; but that this is nothing but an illusive appearance any one, by more careful examination of all the circumstances taking place, may be convinced m the most positive manner. For, when the preparation has not lost its original translucency by the causes mentioned, it is at once easy to observe, sometimes directly, a partition separating the cavity of the expanded uriniferous tube from the vascular bundle. This partition appears like a fine arch-shaped border de- noted by one single line, the convexity of which is directed towards the cavity, and the concavity towards the vascular bundle which is usually most difficult to be distinguished on the most prominent points of the vascular network, and is most manifest in the distri- butions on the delicate interstices of the same, the periphery of which is in uninterrupted connection with the proper tunic or basement membrane of the uriniferous tubes. But even if this partition did not present itself to the eye with the desired distinctness, which from its delicacy, cannot be wonderful, several convincing circum- stances indicate its presence. 1st, The already mentioned entrance of the epithelial fragments m the expanded portions; for, while the latter thereby lose their a,}n; UCenCy’ that °f the Malpighian bodies is little or not at “Paired, and remain clear and transparent, while the resi- dual bffiod globules or their nuclei are from the first not in any way diminished in transparency. y

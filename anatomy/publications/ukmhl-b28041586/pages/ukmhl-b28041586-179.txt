SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 157 and venous branches in whatever part of the body these communi- cations are found. To establish the truth of this statement, it is requisite merely to consider the phenomena of fever in the living body, and its traces and effects in the dead. a. I presume that the affection of the capillary system of the brain, both cranial and vertebral, is too generally admitted to re* quire being formally demonstrated. In point of fact, the pain of the head in the beginning of all fevers, the derangement of thought during their progress, and the tendency to stupor, and absolute coma towards the conclusion, are sufficient alone to prove disorder of the cerebral capillaries. But when blood or serous fluid is found effused into the ventricles, when the vessels of the brain are found turgid, distended with blood, and more numerous than natural, it is impossible to resist the inference as to the overloaded state of the cerebral capillaries during life. I am aware that cases of fever are sometimes adduced, in which neither pain of the head nor deranged thought are observed. I can only say, that, among a very great number of cases which I have observed, though in a few the pa- tient did not complain of headach, it was always possible to recog- nize more or less derangement of thought. In all cases, pain is felt when the patient coughs or stoops, or when the head is slightly shaken, and when no pain is said to be felt, it indicates that the stage of natural sensation is passed, and that he complains not, because he does not feel. In ague, the oppression of the cerebral capillaries may be so great as to constitute inflammation (Siriasis JEgyptiaca,) or phre- nitic ague, or in various degrees the sleepy quotidian, the sleepy, lethargic, hemiplegic, carotic, and apoplectic tertian, and the co- matose quartan of practical authors, (Werlhof, Torti, Lautter, Morton, Sydenham, &c.;) the same disease which has been named by Lancisi, Baglivi, and Morgagni, epidemic apoplexy. (Apo- plexia febricosa, Cams febricosus.) Tbe disorder of the capillaries of the spinal chord is indicated by pain and weight in various parts of the column, by the derange- ment in the muscular motions, especially local palsy, e. g. of the arms, legs, &c. by the tetanic spasms and convulsions taking place in many fevers. After death, much serous fluid flows from the tlieca; the vessels of the chord are distended and numerous; in all instances, serous fluid is effused, and sometimes pure blood is- sues from its capillaries.

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 145 a. The first of these consists in effusion of lymph, or rather sero- albuminous fluid or liquor sanguinis, from capillary arteries in the li- quid form, and which speedily undergoing coagulation as it exudes, is converted into irregular globules or masses. The extent to which this exudation takes place will depend on the extent of the surface and the degree of inflammation ; and the same principles will regu- late the appearance of the globules or masses of lymph in the diffe- rent points of the granulating surface. b. After these globules have been effused and coagulated, they are soon penetrated with vessels which, according to Hunter, may be justly esteemed mere prolongations of the capillaries which ori- ginally secreted the lymph. This penetration of vessels constitutes what may be considered the second stage of granulation. This process, which must have been observed by many practical sur- geons, has been clearly and correctly described by Hunter. “ I have often,” says he, u been able to trace the growth and vascula- rity of this new substance. I have seen on a sure a white substance exactly similar to coagulating lymph. I have not attempted to wipe it off, and the next day of dressing I have found this very substance vascular ; for by wiping or touching it with a probe it has bled freely.” And, again, “ The vessels of granulations pass from the original parts, whatever these are, to the basis of the gra- nulations, from thence toward their external surface, in pretty re- : gular parallel lines, and would almost appear to terminate there.”* , At the same time the formation or secretion of purulent fluid goes . on ; and the surfaces of these bodies themselves acquire the same : power of preparing this fluid which the surface from which the gra- : nulations were produced, possessed. In this instance we have an | example of capillary vessels performing at the same time the effu- i sion of lymph and the secretion of purulent fluid. In this stage of the process of granulation, Mr Hunter has remarked the disposition to union, ohesion, or adhesion, which granulating eminences possess, and described the mechanism by which this is accomplished. By many it might be deemed a distinct process. But in so far as the capillaries are concerned, the chief object ot consideration at present, it is to -be viewed as a part of the second stage. The vessels of the granulating eminences 1 continue to secrete lymph, which unites the corresponding surfaces « of their new bodies till their capillaries pass into each other, so as to inosculate, and the union is completed. * II. p. 477.

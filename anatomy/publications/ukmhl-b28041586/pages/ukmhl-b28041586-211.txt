SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 189 It is undeniable that this arrangement is at once clear, and pos- sesses a sort of interesting regularity, which would prompt the wish, that the existence of these vessels was actually demonstrated with certainty. It is evident, however, that the regularity of arrange- ment is the only advantage which it possesses over the views of those authors, whose method and opinions Bichat professed not to follow. The existence of exhalants is as little proved in the ri- gorous reasoning of Bichat, as in the fanciful theories of Boerhaave, the generalizing conclusions of Haller, or the bold supposition of lateral porosities by Mascagni. This defect in his system has therefore been recognised by Magendie and Beclard, the first of whom, though, he admits the existence of exhalation as a pro- cess of the living body, allows that no explanation of its mecha- nism or material cause has been given, and asserts that Bichat has created the system of vessels termed exhalants;â€”while the second thinks that anatomical observation furnishes no evidence of their existence. The colourless capillaries, he observes, which are admitted by all, and the existence of which is satisfactorily established by the well-known experiment of Bleuland, proves nothing whatever con- cerning the existence of exhalant vessels ; for these colourless ar- teries are observed to terminate in colourless veins, and there is no proof hitherto adduced of their proceeding further, or terminating by open mouths. He admits that the fact of exhalation in the living body, of nutrition, of transudation by arterial extremities, shows that these extremities possess openings through which the fluids of exhalation, the materials of nutrition, and the matter of injection escape. But whether these openings are found at the point, at which the capillary arteries are continuous with veins, or belong to a distinct order of vessels continued beyond these arte- ries, is a question which observation has not yet determined, and which it perhaps is unable to determine. Meanwhile, that the ex- istence of a process such as exhalation is believed to be, is carried on in the animal body, appears to be proved by the phenomena of cndosmosis and exosmosis. Such is the present state of know- ledge in relation to the existence of exhalant arteries. While the process of exhalation is admitted and believed, we must avow, as Cruikshank did long ago, that we are unable to prove satisfac- torily the existence of any set of vessels, or any mechanism by which it might be accomplished.

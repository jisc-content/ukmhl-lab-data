ADVERTISEMENT. Xll By some it may be expected that this work should have hee illustrated with delineations, more especially in reference to mi croscopical anatomy. These, however, would have added so muc to the expense of the work, without otherwise increasing its valu< that it was thought best for the present to dispense with the: assistance. The most effectual way to obtain information in m croscopical anatomy is for the student to take frequent opportun ties of examining, by the microscope, the textures in their health and diseased states. In this, as in all other branches of knowledge nothing can be compared to practice and experience; and no ir formation is equal to that which is obtained by frequent person; observation. In conclusion, the author trusts, that while the work in its pr sent form may be useful to students and practitioners, it is sti more worthy of that degree of favour, with which it was receive by those distinguished members of the profession, whose approb; tion it must always be an honour to obtain. 20, Queen Street, 4 th November 1847.

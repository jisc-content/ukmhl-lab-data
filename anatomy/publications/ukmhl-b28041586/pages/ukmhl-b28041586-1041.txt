MORBID STATES OF THE LUNGS TUBERCLES. 1019 ever, this also may give way, and be destroyed partially or entirely; and hence appears the reason why some anatomists maintain that the tubercle or small vomica is surrounded by a membrane, while by others this is denied. From this account of the progressive formation of tubercles, it results that not only the air-cells are filled, and then obliterated by the exudation of coagulable lymph, but that the areas of the blood- vessels are so contracted, that they no longer admit the wax of in- jection, and become obliterated, and incapable of receiving and conveying blood to the ultimate terminations; and hence the cen- tre of the tubercle wastes, and is consumed and degenerated; and that the vessels, still pervious, assuming the inflammatory action, secrete purulent matter, which dissolves the tubercle already soft- ened and macerated. M. Schroeder van der Kolk further regards this deposition as coagulable lymph, because by immersion in spirit it is coagulated and rendered opaque; and he therefore contends that it is impossible to adopt the view of Laenuec and Lorinzer, or Nasse, that tubercles are formed without previous inflammation. The argument also adduced by the latter author, that tubercular deposition takes place generally in the upper lobe of the lung, whereas peripneumony occurs more frequently in the lower one, he thinks of no moment. He admits the fact, but maintains that it merely shows that tubercular deposition and the consequent vo- miccB differ from peripneumony, and that chronic inflammation dif- fers from the acute form of the disease. The question regarding the origin of tubercles from degenerated bronchial glands, he allows to be more difficult of decision, from the fact, that frequently degeneration and inflammation of the glands of the neck, or some other part, precede the appearance of consumption, and that strumous persons are very liable to the dis- ease. He observes, however, that in examining carefully the bo- dies of the strumous, when the vessels were filled with fine injection he found very minute tubercles occupied in different points by con- cretions, and in general calcareous rather than tubercular matter deposited. In examining such lungs microscopically, he found the minute branches of the bronchial tubes, at least to one-fourth of a hne m diameter, everywhere reddened within by injected vessels and a beautiful net-work expanded on the internal mucous mem- brane ; in some of the minute branches, he saw the smaller glands thick and somewhat whiter; the miliary tubercles were surrounded

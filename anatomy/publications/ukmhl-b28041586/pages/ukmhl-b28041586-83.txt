61 ADIPOSE TISSUE. tunics are then observed to be thickened, and sometimes adhering, with obliteration of the canal; and in several instances matter, or lymph, or both, are found within the veins. Lastly, it may produce denudation of the arteries exactly as a broad ligature, or any fo- reign substance in the neighbourhood of, or around the arterial tubes, and in this manner induce erosion, and rupture of the artery with fatal hemorrhage. In ordinary circumstances, the course of phenomena appears to be nearly the following. Sometimes without previous warning, in other instances after slight sensations of chilness and languor, or even after distinct shivering, heavy dull pain is felt in one part par- ticularly, as the neck, the breast, or an extremity, according to the situation which the disease affects. This painful sensation spreads or extends, amounting to stiff soreness of the whole region, with more or less tenderness of the integuments. If the part is exa- mined, it is found affected with diffuse or extensive swelling, com- pressible, but not very elastic, considerable tension of the skin, great heat, and in some instances a dull red tinge. In some in- stances the skin retains its natural colour,â€”a circumstance which is to be ascribed to the depth of the inflammatory action, and per- haps the early period of the disease. In some it is of aTaint red, inclining to yellow or orange, which becomes more distinct when pressure is applied; and in some the disease passes through every stage without even producing redness of the skin. In others lono- red patches, of no determinate shape, may be remarked; but this elastic character, as if tl fluid or semifluid matter.

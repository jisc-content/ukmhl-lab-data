X PREFACE, pelled me to touch very cursorily on many points, which, from their importance, would have required fuller details. Though I have throughout been solicitous to present the unbroken chain of evidence, on which the inferences and deductions are made to rest, I have often been obliged to state the latter only, and in a form perhaps too dogmatic, with the view of saving the time of the reader. In no instance, however, has this been done without deliberate examination of the authorities for every fact, and of the evidences for each conclusion. On ordinary points, on which pathological opinion is unanimous, I have been sparing of reference, or omitted it entirely. On subjects, on the contrary, on which information is doubtful and scanty, or on which there is room for diversity of sentiment, I have, by referring the reader to the best sources, enabled him to appreciate the validity of the conclusions stated. Without attempting, however, to refer to all the authori- ties extant, which must have uselessly enlarged the work, I have directed him chiefly to those which are at once most useful and most accessible. Edinburgh, 4th November 1828.

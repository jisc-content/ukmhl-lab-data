' GENERAL AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY. 12 nial body are omitted, or can have no convenient place of refer- ence. Mayer therefore reduces the twenty-one tissues of Bichat to seven, and adds an eighth, comprehending the crystalline lens, the cornea, epidermis, hair, nails, &c. to which he gives the general name of lamellar tissue. The classification of organic tissues given hy this anatomist would stand in the following order:—* I. Lamellar. f II. Filamentous. Cellular. Crystalline lens, Cornea. Cuticle. Hair', nails in whatever form, as claws, bill, hoof. Horns, scales, &c. f Teeth. 1. Cellular system, 2. Adipose system, 3. Aledullary system, Serous system, Synovial, Vascular, Dermoid, Mucous, 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. S. Cellulosum. S. Adiposum. Medullare. Serosum. Synoviale. Vasculosum. Dermodeum. Mucosum. Structure of the womb and reservoirs of secreted fluids, Uterus. Hard membrane, Dura meninx, pura mater. Periosteum. Cartilage. Proper membrane of intestinal tube, T. Nervosa. Membrane of synovial capsules. Ligaments. Sheaths, Vaginae tendinum. Aponeurosis, Fascia. Tendon. Neurilema. Soft membrane, Meninx tenuis, Pia mater. To these may be added a series of parts pertaining at once to the fibrous and the filamentous cellular system, since their structure presents a predomination of fibrous filaments. These are, The Sclerotic. The Tunica albuginea of the testicle. The Proper tunic of the spleen and kidneys. The Cellulo-fibrous sheath of conglomerate and conglobate glands. The Corpus cavernosum and C. spongiosum. Til. Fibrous. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. IV. V. Cartilaginous. Osseous. 1. Lymphatic ganglion or glands. VI. Glandular. 2. « Granular glands, or those provided with excreting duct, the lacrymal gland, the salivary glands, the pancreas, liver, kidneys. (i Glandular organs without excreting duct, as the spleen, thy- mus, renal capsules. These three forms of glandular organs are considered by Professor Mayer as combi- nations of minute lymphatics, or blood-vessels, or both united. VII. Muscular. 1. Animal or voluntary. 2. Organic or involuntary. VIII. Nervous. * Sur l’Histologie, avec une division nouvelle des tissus du corps humain. Par le Docteur Mayer, Prof. d’Anatomie et de Physiologie.

The dura mater often becomes the seat of a firm tumour, which, as it grows, produces absorption of the cranial bones.. In the ex- cellent collection of cases by M. Louis, we find that it invariably proceeded to bad ulceration; but that death in general took place in consequence of interruption to the functions of the biain. § 5. In the testicle I have seen a peculiar disease which I refer to the albuginea and its serous covering. The testicle seems much enlarged and irregular; but shortly ulceration takes place, and discloses an extensive mass of dead matter evidently exterior to the gland. The sloughing process alternating with ulceration and gra- nulation proceeds till the whole exterior coat of the testicle is ex- pelled. This process, which occurred in a scrofulous subject, and never showed any tendency to malignant ulceration, I ascribe to death of the fibro-serous covering of the testicle, and perhaps of the gland itself. XI. Fibrous and Fibro-cartilaginous Tumours.—Cartilagi- nous and bony matter of different degrees of firmness and perfection are often observed in the cerebral membranes, more especially the dura mater. Of this change manifold instances are given by Bonetus, Morgagni, Lieutaud, Sandifort, and other collectors; and they are delineated by Baillie and Hooper. These cases are vaguely men- tioned under the general title of ossification of the brain; but few of them are entitled to this character, for all of these originate in the membranes. The only authentic instance apparently of bony matter found in tbe substance of the brain unconnected with the membranes, is that delineated by Dr Hooper in his 12th engraving. The description, nevertheless, is not sufficiently minute to justify positive assertion.

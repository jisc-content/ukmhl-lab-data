425 WHITE FIBROUS SYSTEM. ter mine whether the bone or periosteum were the original seat of the disease. 8. Punctured and contused wounds of the white fibrous system, especially of the ligaments and periosteum, are liable to be succeed- ed by tetanic motions, more or less general; and wounds with much laceration in subjects of all ages are too often followed by gangrenous inflammation terminating fatally. This I have seen several times, not only in compound dislocations of the larger joints, but in contused wounds of the feet, in which the white fi- brous system is much injured. Partial laceration of the capsular ligaments occasionally takes place in dislocation. (A. Bonn, De- sault, Howship, Sir A. Cooper.) 9. Desmectasis. Excessive relaxation is mentioned as an abnor- mal state occurring in ligaments. It is the result of repeated over- I distension, as in luxation or subluxation, or in consequence of the â– 1 weakness sometimes left after local inflammation, or long-continued disease. Though this may happen to the ligaments of any joint, it is most frequently seen in those of temporo-maxillary and sca- pulo-humeral articulations. Distortions of the spine are ascribed by Dr Harrison to relaxation of the vertebral ligaments. But if this be the cause, it is merely as the effect of previous disease; and it is quite inadequate to produce the extreme deformity so frequent- ly observed in the vertebral column of young persons. On the new or accidental production of the fibrous system in other tissues, much has of late years been written by Bichat, Bayle, Laennec, and other foreign authors. Without positively denying the principle, that the fibrous system may be accidentally developed, I think with Meckel, that in general these products partake of the cartilaginous character. The notice of them, therefore, will more conveniently be introduced under that head.

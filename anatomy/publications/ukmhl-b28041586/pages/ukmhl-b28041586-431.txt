According to the results ob- tained by these observers, rupture of the heart is most frequent in the left ventricle, which gives way by a longitudinal fissure near the base and middle of the ventricle. In most of the cases, this rupture may be traced to previous ulceration, (Morgagni, Haller, Portal, Brera, &c.) and appears to be the result of the ulcerative process advancing from one surface of the ventricle to the other. Of rupture of the right ventricle too little is known to determine whether it be also the result of ulceration or not. So far, there- fore, as is hitherto known, laceration of the muscular substance of the heart is not so much the consequence of being violently or forci- bly torn, as of its being previously wasted, extenuated, and weakened. Transverse laceration of muscular fibres, or forcible detachment from the tendons, may happen in consequence of external violence. This was seen by Wolfius,§§ Wynandts,|||| Cheselden,1H[ Por- tal,*** Derame,|ft Bichat,!!! and Wardrop.§§§ Rupture of the muscular coat of the stomach, which is not un- frequent, is in like manner the consequence of ulceration or erosion of its villous membrane, and shall be noticed under that head. 7. Bony induration or deposition.—This, though not very fre- quent, is not unknown. Morgagni mentions in his first case of ulcerative rupture a bony mass an inch thick, shaped like a half ring, being found in the muscular substance of the left ventricle, adhering, however, to the mitral valves, also ossified. A similar case is recorded by Haller; and to such instances it may be justly objected, that they are not so much examples of conversion of mus- cular fibre into bone as deposition of bony matter in collateral tis- sues progressively encroaching on the muscular layer. One of the most distinct examples of seeming conversion of muscular fibre into * Mem. de 1’Acad. Roy. des Sci. 1732. t Epist. xxvii. 2, 5, 8 ; Ixiv. 15. + Elem. Phyeiolog. § Mem. de l’Acad.

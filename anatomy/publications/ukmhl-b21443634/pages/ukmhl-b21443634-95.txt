DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 81 and on division of these the brain can be removed, care being taken to raise with it the olfactory lobes from their resting-places on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. If the subject he lying on its hack when the brain is to be removed, the anterior lobes of the hemi- spheres, with the olfactory bulbs, are to be first raised, the optic nerves, internal carotid arteries, infundihu- lum and third pair of nerves are then to be severed ; and after that the tentoriiom is to be divided near its attachment, the fourth and ffth nerves being divided along with it, then the other nerves in series, and afterwards the vertebral arteries and spinal cord ; while last of all, when the brain has been dislodged, it is necessary to divide the veins of Galen to prevent the choroid plexus being torn from its place. If the brain is to be preserved, it will be advisable^ if possible, to examine the blood-vessels of the base at once, and the whole or the greater part of the arachnoid and pia mater should be removed, so as to lay open the sulci and allow ready entrance to the spirit. The cerebellum should also be lifted up a little from the posterior lobes of the cerebrum to allow the pia mater to be dissected at the back of the corpus callosum, so as to give the spirit ingress into the ventricles. 3. Base of Brain and its Vessels.â€”Some folds of calico moistened with spirit having been arranged like a nest on a plate, so as to support the hemi- spheres, the brain is laid on it with the base turned upwards. The student will then observe, in the first place, the main masses of the encephalon. He will Q

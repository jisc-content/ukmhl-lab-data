64 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. plantar nerve, larger than the external, will be seen giving off a branch to the abductor pollicis, and di- viding into four digital nerves supplying respectively the inner side of the great toe, and the adjacent sides of the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth toes ; and from the first of these branches the nerve to the flexor brevis pollicis will be found coming ofi", and from the second and third the nerves to the two inner lumbricales. At this stage of the dissection the tendinous sheaths on the toes should be dissected out and divided, and the arrangement of the tendons within them should be examined ; but the dissection of the insertions of the lumbricales must be left till a later period. The posterior tibial nerve and the tendons of the long flexors must now be divided below the ankle and reflected, and the short muscles of the great and little toes, together with the plantar arch and deep branch of the external plantar nerve, are to be dis- sected out. In reflecting the tendons, care is to be taken not to injure the nerves to the two outer lum- bricales, coming from the branch named. The other twigs from the same branch are distributed to the adductor pollicis, the transversus pedis and the in- terossei ; the two outer interossei may, however, receive their twigs from the inner digital branch of the external plantar. The abductor jJollicis "will be distinguished by having its fibres collected to a dis- tinct tendon on the inner side of the great toe ; the â– flexor brevis pollicis lies next, and is fleshy and in- serted in two heads, with which are connected the two sesamoid bones of the ball of the toe ; the adduc-

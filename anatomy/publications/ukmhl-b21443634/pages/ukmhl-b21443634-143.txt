DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 129 If the muscles behind the vertebrae have not yet been dissected, they ought to be examined now according to the directions already given (p. 77). The vertebral muscles are to be cleared away, and the movements permitted between the cervical verte- brae examined : also the upper end of the anterior common ligament will be seen. The laminae are then to be cut across, if this has not been previously done for the examination of the spinal cord ; and it will be noticed that the ligamenta suhjlava between the lower vertebrae are replaced between the occipital bone, atlas and axis by white fibrous tissue. Within the spinal canal the upper part of the posterior common ligament is seen, and connected with it the flat band from the body of the axis to the occipital bone. When this has been reflected, the transverse ligament of the atlas, with the upper and lower appendage which give it a cruciate form, will be seen ; and also the lateral odontoid or check ligaments passing out- wards to the occipital bone from the odontoid process of the axis, and between them the delicate middle odontoid ligament. The character of the movements of the articular surfaces of the atlas, axis, and occi- pital bone is then to be noticed, as well as the bursa behind and in front of the odontoid process ; and the movements permitted by the articulations of the six lower cervical vertebrae should also be studied. If the parts be in a state of particularly good preserva- tion, a vertical transverse section may be made through some of the vertebrae to exhibit the joints of Luschka at the sides of the intervertebral discs. 17.

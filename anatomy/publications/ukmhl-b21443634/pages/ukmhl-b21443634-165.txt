DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 151 favoui'able subject, may be traced forwards. On the left side, the ^jwc^zc artery and nerve may now be dissected out as far as is possible in the present dis- section, when the origins of the branches already exliibited will be brought into view, as well as the artery to the corpus cavernosum. The anterior edge of the levator ani muscle, which passes directly for- wards on the deep surface of the deep layer of sub- pubic fascia and supports the prostate, is now to be dissected out on both sides ; and if the attachment of the superficial sphincter to the central point of the periiiEeum be divided, and the rectum pushed back with the handle of the scalpel, a most instructive view of the prostate gland and lowest part of the bladder, as seen when separated from the rectum, may be obtained. 2. The Abdominal Wall.â€”This dissection may be begun as soon as the subject is laid on its back. It will sometimes be found expedient to make on one side a continuous dissection of the flat muscles throughout their whole extent, and to reserve the lower part of the abdominal wall on the other side for a special examination of the parts through which inguinal hernia may take its course ; but in the directions about to be given a plan is recommended by which all the structures may be exhibited con- veniently on one side ; and the intelligent dissector will be able, with the consent of his partner, to modify those directions so as to suit particular cir- cumstances. A mesial incision deviating to one side at the umbilicus is to be made from the lower end of the

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 33 with the anastomotic and inferior profunda, and im- mediately afterwards the interosseous artery, which at once divides into anterior and posterior interosseous, the latter piercing between the bones to the back of the forearm. At the wrist will be seen the origins of the anterior and posterior carpal branches of the ulnar artery. In contact with the artery on its inner side in the lower half of the forearm is the ulnar nerve, and this is to be traced up to the part already exposed behind the inner condyle of the humerus ; and its branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner half of the flexor profundus digitorum should be seen. The deep muscles can now be displayed without division of the superficial group, or by dividing, at most, the radial origin of the flexor sublimis digi- torum. Two of the deep muscles are longitudinal, namely, the flexor longus pollicis to the outside, and the flexor profundus digitorum more internally ; and on turning these aside, one from the other, there will be seen in the lower part of the forearm the remain- ing deep muscle, the pronator quadratus, with its fibres placed transversely. Descending to the pro- nator quadratus, on the interosseous membrane, can be seen the anterior interosseous nerve and artery whose origins have been already noted. 8. The Front of the Hand.â€”An incision may be made down the centre of the palm and crossed by another at the roots of the fingers, and the fingers and thumb may be laid open by means of an incision down the middle of each. The palmar branches of the median and ulnar nerves may be followed. The palma/r fascia is then to be exposed, and the firmness D

26 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. scapular nerve and artery are to be followed beneath it, as, after supplying it, they pass behind the neck of the scapula into the infraspinatus muscle. The infraspinatus is to be likewise raised, and the dorsal branch of the suhscajmlar artery followed, as it rami- fies beneath it. Lastly, the subscapvilaris muscle is to be dissected from its origin, the tendinous septa attached to ridges of the subscapular fossa are to be noted ; and the bursa connected with the shoulder-joint and situated between the muscle and the neck of the scapula is to be examined. 5. Subcutaneous Structures of Arm and Forearm. â€”As a general rule, it is advisable to make a longi- tudinal incision down the front of the limb, and to remove the integument at once as far as the wrist, so as to get a continuous view of the subcutaneous veins and nerves throughout this region ; but some- times the imperfect preservation of the part, or other reasons, may suggest the expediency of leaving the forearm untouched until after the brachial dissection is completed. When the skin as far as the wrist has been reflected, it will be well, before attempting to remove the subcutaneous fat, to trace the inter costo-humeral nerve to its distribution, if this be not already done ; then to follow the nerve of Wrisherg (lesser internal ctotaneous) from its origin from the internal brachial cord to its termination between the olecranon and inner condyle of the humerus ; also to trace the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve from its origin near the axilla to its dis- tribution on the inner side of the arm.

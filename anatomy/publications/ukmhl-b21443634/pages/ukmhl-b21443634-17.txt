THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. 3 lightly turned aside with the closed forceps, without being held between the teeth of the instrument. The scalpel ought never to be held with the handle in the palm of the hand and the forefinger on the back of the blade, like a bistoury, save only in making incisions. It is usually held like a pen between the forefinger and thumb, while the ex- tremity of the middle finger furnishes a slight sup- port on which it may be turned so as to direct the cutting edge towards or away from the dissector at will. The management of the scalpel varies a little, according as it is used for the dissection of large muscles or vessels and nerves. In laying bare a large muscle, such as the superficial muscles of the back, buttock, breast and abdomen, it takes as little time to make the dissection clean and display the structui-es properly as to bring the muscles into view in a less successful fashion, with the fascia left adherent in patches, and the cutaneous nerves de- stroyed. So far as the display of the muscular fibres is concerned, the following are the directions to be attended to : 1. Having raised a small portion of the fascia or integument to be removed, grasp it fii-mly between the fingers and thumb, and pull on it so as to make it tense. This is best done by laying the second joint of the forefinger of the left hand on the surface of the tissue to be removed, seizing with the thumb the raised edge of the tissue so as to press it against the forefinger, and turning the wrist so as to stretch the tissue over the forefinger. A furrow will thus be formed bounded on one side by the muscle and on the b2

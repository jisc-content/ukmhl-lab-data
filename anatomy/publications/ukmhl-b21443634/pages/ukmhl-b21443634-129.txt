DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 115 â– smart blow of the mallet and turned forwards or removed without injury to the facial structures on its surface; and the unroofing of the orbit, back to the cavernous sinus, should be completed by further use of the bone-nippers. The dura mater investing the contents of the orbit is then to be slit open, and the fronted branch of the oplitlialmic nerve will be seen passing forwards and dividing into the supra- trochlear and supra-orbital, which may be followed into continuity with the facial dissection. Also, passing forwards in the middle will be seen the levator 2jalpebrce muscle going forwards to the cartilage of the upper lid, and the su2:)erior rectus muscle of the eyeball, immediately below it. A little internal to this is the superior oblique muscle, which is to be followed forwards to its pulley at the fovea trochlearis of the frontal bone, and is to be traced thence to the eyeball. Near the back part of this muscle by its outer edge and on its upper surface the fourth nerve will be seen entering it, and this is to be traced back into continuity with the dissection in the cavernous sinus. Also, the frontal nerve is to be traced back- wards, when it will be found, at the back of the orbit, to give off a smaller branch, the lachrymal, which is to be traced to the lachrymal gland at the upper and outer part of the eye, and will be found to send branches forwards to the outer half of the upper eyelid. A quantity of fat may now be removed most effectually and rapidly by moving the scalpel back- wards and forwards, with its edge directed to one side, so as to push the fat with the flat of the blade I 2

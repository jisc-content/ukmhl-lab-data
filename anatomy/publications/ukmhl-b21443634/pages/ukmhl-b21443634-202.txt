188 DISSECTIOlSr OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. to show the appearance of its mucous membrane, and the slight transverse plications into which it is thrown, sometimes called folds of Houston. The ureters are to be followed down to their points of entrance into the bladder, and the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the bladder is to be examined. This will be seen to be highly complex ; and the most strikmg points are a superficial strip of vertical fibres in front and behind, spreading out above, and fibres circling with all degrees of obliquity. At the upper end is the urachus. In the male the prostate and copious prostatic plexus of veins, and the membranous part of the urethra are to be cleared, and the vasa deferentia and vesiculse seminales are to be dissected out. The vesiculse seminales will be seen to be each doubled on itself ; and they are to be cut into, to show the re- ticular character of their mucous membrane. On continuing the dissection down to the prostate, the junction of vas deferens and the duct of the vesicula seminalis to form the ejaculatory duct will be brought into view ; and a deep mesial part of the prostate behind the entrance of the ejaculatory ducts, and separated by them from the main mass of the gland lying in front of them and around them, will be dis- tinguished, which is the middle lobe of the prostate. It may be well to divide the penis about the middle, to note the appearance of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum on transverse section, and the section of the artery in each corpus cavernosum, then to slit the urethra in the distal portion from beneath, so as to show the dilatation of the urethra called fossa

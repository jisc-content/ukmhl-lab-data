DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 12Y in which the vocal cord is situated. If now the mucous membrane above the true vocal cord on the side so far dissected be removed, a good view of the folds of the true and false vocal cords of the opposite side, and the ventricle between them, will be obtained, with the saccule extending from the forepart of the ventricle. The movements of the thyroid and ary- tenoid cartilages on the cricoid cartilage, their influ- ence on the position and tension of the vocal cords, and the muscles by which they are effected ought to be carefully studied. The nasal fossÂ£e are now to be examined ; and for this purpose the cribriform plate and the portions of the frontal and sphenoid bones in front and behind it should be sawn close to the middle line on the side least dissected; the saw should then be with- drawn, and the palate should be sawn through on the same side from below. The septum of the nose should be denuded of its mucous membrane and the naso-palatine nerve should be looked for in its course from Meckel's ganglion to the anterior palatine fora- men ; and in a favourable specimen it, as well as the accompanying branch of the internal maxillary artery, may be traced to the palate, and the communication of the nerves of opposite sides called ganglion of Cotunnius may be shown. The three meatus of the nose are to be next examined. The relations of the upper meatus to the ethmoidal cells and sphenoidal sinus, the opening of the maxillary antrum into the middle meatus, and the communication of that meatus with the frontal sinus through the infundibulum in its forepart should be looked at; also the direction, in the, inferior meatus, which a probe or canula must

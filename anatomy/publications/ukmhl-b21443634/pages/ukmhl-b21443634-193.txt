DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 179 lumbar vertebra, and the Ugamentum arcuatum ex- ternum, arching from the first transverse process to the last rib over the quadratus lumborum, are all to b)e dissected out. Also, the positions and mode of formation of the openings for the aorta, oesophagus ^ind vena cava inferior are to be observed. The psoas magnus and iliacus muscles are next to be cleaned, as also the jysoas parvus, if present. The presence of the psoas parvus is recognised by its long and broad shining tendon on the surface of the psoas magnus. In cleaning the psoas magnus, care is to be taken of the genito-crural nerve, which pierces it, either as one trunk, or in two places after separation into genital and crural branches. The genital branch is to be traced to the inguinal canal, and the crural branch to its point of emergence from the abdomen outside the external iliac artery. Outside the psoas magnus are to be dissected out the fascia iliaca and the iKacus muscle, also the upper branches of the lumbar plexus ; namely, the ilio-hypogastric nerve crossing the quadratus lumborum to the outer part of the crest of the ilium ; the ilia-inguinal distinguished from the ilio-hypogastric, when separate from it, by crossing a small part of the iliacus muscle ; the ex- ternal cutaneous passing to the anterior superior spine â€¢of the ilium ; and the large trunk of the anterior crvA'al hid in the groove between the psoas and iliacus muscles. Inside the psoas will be found the remain- ing branch of distribution of the lumbar plexus, the obturator nerve, making for the obturator foramen, but occasionally giving off a small branch, the acces- sory obturator, which passes over the pubic bone, and N 2

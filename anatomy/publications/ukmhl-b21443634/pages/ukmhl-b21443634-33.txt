DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 19 the extremity of the nipple, the galactopliorous diocts, each with its ampulla, or dilatation, beneath the cuta- neous areola, will be seen ; and in young adults they may be traced inwards, and their orifices may be displayed by passing bristles through them. On sub- sequent removal of the fascia from the pectoralis major muscle beneath, the important connections of the mamma with it will be seen ; and, lastly, a vertical incision should be made through the gland in such a manner as to bisect the nipple. Beneath the subcutaneous fascia are the pectoralis major muscle and the forepart of the deltoid, the pectoralis extending from the chest and inner end of the clavicle, and the deltoid from the outer par-t of the clavicle and from the shoulder, while between the two is the cephalic vein. In removing the fascia from these muscles, the following cutaneous nerves maybe preserved : the anterior cutaneous branches of the six upper intercostal nerves emerging with corresponding branches of blood-vessels from the fore part of the intercostal spaces, the descending cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus crossing over the clavicle, and the anterior twigs of the lateral cutaneous branches of the third and succeeding intercostal nerves, turn- ing inwards over the axillary border of the great pectoral muscle. The lower part of the fibres of the platysrtia myoides, the cutaneous muscle of the neck, will also be seen crossing the clavicle. After the pectoralis major muscle has been thoroughly exposed, its clavicular attachment should be divided, and the divided portion of the muscle should be reflected, care being taken of the cephalic c 2

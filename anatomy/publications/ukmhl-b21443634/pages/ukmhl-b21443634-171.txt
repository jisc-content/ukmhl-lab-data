DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 157 sheath a little below the fold of Douglas and at the place where it enters there are often to be noticed two diverging aponeurotic bands, one passing inwards towards the pubes, and the other passing downwards and outwards external to and continuous with the conjoined tendon, close to the margin of the deep abdominal ring. The deep inguinal dissection is now to be pro- ceeded with. The lower portion of the ajDoneurosis of the external oblique muscle is to be raised with the handle of the scalpel from the parts beneath, and is to be divided by an incision continued immediately outside the sheath of the rectus muscle down to the pubes. The external and interned2nllars of the super- ficial abdominal ring will thus be brought more fully into view, so that their attachments may be studied, together with the intercolumnar fascia, a thin membranous sheath continued from the margins of the ring, down on the surface of the spermatic cord in the male, and less distinctly developed in the female. Beneath the portion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle now reflected, fibres of the internal oblique muscle, taking origin from the upper two-thirds of Poupart's ligament, extend inwards, the upper fibres lying in a transverse direction and those below arching more and more downwards ; while from the lower third of Poupart's ligament in the male, other muscular fibres take origin, which turn downwards on the surface of the spermatic cord, and constitute the main part of the cremaster muscle, represented in the female by a. smaller group of muscular fibres somewhat detached

162 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. the genital branch of the genito-crv/ral nerve supply- ing the cremaster, also the cremasteric artery, a small branch of the epigastric. He will then follow the infundibuliform fascia downwards, and show its con- tinuity with the fascia propria of the testicle, and will proceed to dissect separate the elements of the spermatic cord. The vas deferens is recognised by its toughness, which gives it the feeling of whipcord ; and the spermaPic artery, a branch of the aorta, to- gether with the copious spermatic veins and nerves, will be easily distinguished. Also, in close connection with the vas deferens is the deferent artery, a small branch derived from the superior vesical. The testicle is now to be removed by dividing the spermatic cord, and is to be laid out for dissection on the table or on a flat dish with a little spirit or water in it. The vas deferens and other structures of the cord are to be followed to the testicle. The tunica vaginalis, or serous investment of the testicle, is then to be opened by an incision made down the front, when the body of the testicle enclosed in the tunica alhuginea with the serous covering reflected over it will come into view, with the lobus major of the epididymis above, the lobus minor below, and the body of the epididymis on the outside, separated from the testis by a digital fossa. In front of the lobus major will be found a little appendage, and sometimes a cyst or two, the hydatid of Morgagni, a vestige of the Wolffian body. The parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis, and the rest of the tissue round the testicle, may now be cleared away, the continuity of the vas deferens and lobus minor of the epididymis at the

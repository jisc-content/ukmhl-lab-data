DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 159 the reflection of the internal oblique and transversalis muscle is seen to emerge from a deep position by turn- ing over a crescentic margin of aponeurotic fibres, and this is what is termed the internal or dee20 abdo- minal ring. On examination the ring will be found not to present a complete perforation, but to have from its margins a thin membranous sheath prolonged down on the spermatic cord : this is the infundibuli- form fascia, and although but a delicate and seem- ingly unimportant film, is worthy of the dissector's attention on account of its liability, like other fascise already mentioned, to undergo enormous thickening in cases of hernia. Beneath the transversalis fascia, between it and the peritoneum, is a layer of loose adipose tissue, the subperitoneal fat; also passing upwards and inwards beneath the spermatic cord, and internal to the deep abdominal ring, is the deep epigastric artery with an accompanying vein, and curving upwards and outwards is the deep) circumflex iliac artery. At this stage it is advisable to divide the recti muscles and open into the cavity of the abdomen by means of a transverse incision at the level of the umbilicus. Lifting up the lower part of the abdo- minal wall, it will then be seen that it is thrown into three fosste below, one in the middle with a slight cord, the remains of the urachus extending up in the middle line from the fundus of the bladder to the umbilicus, and one on each side separated from the middle fossa by the obliterated hypogastric arteries, which, ascending on the sides of the bladder, pass likewise to the umbilicus. The deep epigastric artery

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 125 palati round the hamular process, and its insertion in part into the hard palate should be seen. From the extremity of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube the fe^v^ fibres termed sa^nngo-pharyngeiLs will be seen to descend when present, and running down the uvula the pair of muscles named azygos. If the palate and tongue be now pulled in opposite directions, and the wall of the pharynx kept on the stretch with pins, the parts will be in the position most favourable for the display of the two muscles on each side descending from the palate, namely, the palato-glossus in front of the tonsil, and the j)alato-pharynge%is spreading out behind to the middle line of the pharynx. The larynx and tongue are now to be separated from the parts above, and on the surface of the tongue the three kinds of painllce, namely, filiform, fungi- form, and circumvallate, are to be studied, especially the Y-shaped arrangement of the circumvallate. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue should be dis- sected up as far as possible, and the intrinsic muscles then examined. Between the genio-glossus and hyo glossus will be found the longitudinal muscle, the inferior lingualis, and by removal of the mucous membrane of the dorsum, the superior lingualis. The vertical and transverse sets of muscular fibres, as well as the terminal arrangement of the fibres of the genio-glossus, are best exhibited by thin transverse sections held up against the light. The aperture of the glottis, the arrangement of the epiglottis, and, so far as can be seen without dissection, the vocal cords having been seen, the mucous membrane is to be removed from the back

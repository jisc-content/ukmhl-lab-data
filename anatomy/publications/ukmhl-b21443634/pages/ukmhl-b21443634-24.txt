10 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 1. The Back. â€” The subject being placed on its face, with the chest and pelvis supported by means of blocks, let an incision be made from the seventh cervical spine down the middle line to the most pro- minent part of the sacrum, another from the acro- mion to the upper end of the mesial incision, and a third along the crest of the ilium to the sacrum. If the subject be fat, it will be found convenient to dissect the integument of the flap thus formed care- fully separate from all the subcutaneous tissue ; but if the subject be lean, it is quite possible to make a thoroughly clean dissection of the muscles at once, and at the same time save all the cutaneous nerves.' Extending from the dorsal spines to the spine of ' In this University it is the rule to dissect the skin per- fectly free from all the subcutaneous adipose tissue, then to reflect that tissue in a sheet and remove it. By this means a source of uncleanness is got rid of, while the integument is preserved as an efficient protection to the part, beneath which there may be applied cloths with preservative fluids. If this plan be followed in the present dissection, it becomes alike unnecessary and undesirable to make a cutaneous incision from the twelfth dorsal spine to the fold of the axilla, as is sometimes recommended.

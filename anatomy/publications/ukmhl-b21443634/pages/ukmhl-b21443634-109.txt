DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 95 being taken not to injure the irmscular fibres of the thin subcutaneous sheet of muscle, the platysma myoides, and the branches of cutaneous nerves de- scendiiig over the clavicle. Reflect the skin towards the face, and at the same time display underneath it the platysma myoides muscle ; then let this also be reflected upwards, and dissect the trunks of super- ficial veins and nerves. The principal superficial veins are the anterior and external jugular veins, and they present varieties in difierent subjects ; but the anterior is distinguished by dipping down to the deep structures in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, while the external jugular dips down behind that muscle. The nerves to be sought are the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and radiate from the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; the small occipital ascends along the pos- terior border of the muscle; the great auricular is directed towards the interval between the ear and the jaw ; the siqyerjicial cervical turns directly for- wards before dividing over the anterior triangle or part of the neck in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle; and the descending branches, stretching over the pos- terior triangle, are distinguished as sicpra-sternal, supra-clavicular, and su,pra-acromial. 6. Posterior Triangle.â€”In pursuing the dissec- tion just made, a considerable amount of loose con- nective tissue will be found, in which the descending cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus are im- bedded. This is now to be removed ; the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and anterior border of the trapezius are to be cleared, and the

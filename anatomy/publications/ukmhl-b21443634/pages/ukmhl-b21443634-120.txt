106 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. maxillary artery and the buccal nerve from the in- ferior maxillary trunk. Below the mouth the depressor anguli oris will be seen extending directly downwards ; and internal to it, slightly concealed by it, the j&bres of the flat de2}ressor lahii inferioris pass upwards and inwards, extending to the middle line. The remaining muscle of this region, the levator menti, can be seen to most advantage by first everting the lower lip and remov- ing the mucous membrane from the upper border of the levatores menti of both sides where they arise from the incisor fossse of the lower jaw, and then making a mesial incision through the integument of the chin but leaving the lip undivided, when their fibres will be seen spreading downwards and inwards towards the surface. The depressor labii is to be divided, and beneath it there will be seen emerging from the mental foramen the mental branches of the inferior dental artery and nerve, the artery a branch of the internal maxillary, and the nerve a branch of the third division of the fifth. Beneath the depressor anguli oris and anastomosing with the mental artery is the inferior labial branch of the facial. The lips ought now to be everted as much as possible, and held in that position while the mucous membrane is dissected off so as to show the buccal glands like small lentils, and the deep surface of the orbicularis oris muscle. Being the deepest of the muscles of the oral orifice, the orbicularis is best dis- sected in this manner, which displays also the attach- ment of some of its fibres to the upper and lower jaws, and the coronary branches of the facial artery

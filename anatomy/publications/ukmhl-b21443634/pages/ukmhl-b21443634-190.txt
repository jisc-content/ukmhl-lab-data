176 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. from the loose fat in which they are imbedded â€¢ but caution is to be exercised in removing the fat at their upper ends, lest damage be done to the supra- renal cajjsules, which will be recognised as a pair of flat structures, an inch or more in height and less than two inches in breadth, of a dull brownish- yellow colour ; with a little care they are easily pre- served, and the numerous small vessels and nerves entering them seen. Laying hold of the divided end of the inferior vena cava, the dissector may foUow the tributaries of that vessel backwards towards their origin; viz. the small veins from the diaphragm and suprarenal capsules ; the large renal veins, the left one of which crosses the aorta ; the spermatic veins in the male, or ovarian veins in the female, opening, the right one into the vena c&va, direct, and the left one into the left renal vein ; lower down, four lumbar veins on each side ; and, lastly, the two common iliac veins, by the union of which the vena cava inferior is formed, and the small middle sacral vein between them. The union of the common iliac veins is crossed by the right common iliac artery ; and the relations of these parts are not to be disturbed. The coeliac axis will be found to be surrounded by a thick mesh work of nerves, the coeliac plexus ; and when this is followed back and traced outwards at the sides, it is seen to extend into a larger plexus, with a large knotted-looking ganglion, or clump of ganglia on each side : the whole plexus is called the solar plexus^ and the ganglionic masses the semilunar ganglia. From this plexus, the smaller plexuses are to be traced along the arteries from which they are

The re- maining portion of the urethra is to be slit open from above by a cut carried close to one side of the septum of the corpora cavernosa, so as to lay bare the septum, then continued in a straight line on through the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra and the front of the bladder. The recesses in the spongy part of the urethra, as well as the appearance of the mucous membrane, are to be noted ; also the dilatation in the bulb and the thickening of the corpus spongiosum at that part.

Within the bladder are specially to be noted the valvular openings of the ureters, and the space between these and the neck termed the trigone. In the female, the bladder and urethra are to be slit open from above, and the trigone examined as in the male. The vagina is to be cut open by an incision carried along one side, and its rugae are to be examined : they are most prominent in the lower part, especially in front.

12 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. from the cervical plexus, which, are on no account to be damaged, even by a junior dissector, but to be preserved, so as to have their continuity from above displayed by the dissectors of the head and neck. The rhomboideus major and minor muscles are to be freed from fascia, care being taken not to injure their nerve, as it passes beneath their upper border; and when those muscles have been divided by a ver- tical incision near their vertebral extremity, this nerve (a branch fi"om the fifth cervical), together witli the posterior scajmlar artery, may be seen in its continuity by the dissectors of the head and neck and upper limb together. The peculiar tendinous attachment of the rhomboideus major to the scapula is to be exhibited from the deep side. On the upper border of the scapula the insertions of the levator anguli scapulce and omo-hyoid should be exhibited ; and the supra- scapular artery and nerve may be noted as they pass respectively above and below the suprascapular liga- ment, but will be better seen in a later dissection. The latissimus dorsi is to be divided by an in- cision beginning at its upper border, two inches from the mesial line, and curving downAvards and outwards to the outer border an inch below the last rib. Let the inner part be then raised, so as to exhibit the connection with the lumbar aponeurosis and the origin from the crest of the ilium ; and in raising the outer part, let the costal slips of origin be brought into full view, as well as their interdigitation with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. Also dissect out the posterior border of the external oblique muscle between the last rib and the ilium, and the

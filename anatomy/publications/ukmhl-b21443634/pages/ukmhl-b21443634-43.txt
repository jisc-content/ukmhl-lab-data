DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 29 may be exhibited ; namely, that to the coraco-hrachia- lis, given off as it pierces it, and branches to the bi- ceps and brachialis anticus as it passes down between them to become superficial on the outer side of the former. The aponeurotic part of the insertion (^semilunar fascia) of the biceps, extending inwards between the brachial artery and median-basilic vein, and important in connection with venesection, is to be specially noted. The brachial artery with the median nerve in front of it, and with its vence comites joined by the basilic, and ending in the axillary vein, may now be dissected out. At its commencement will be seen the superior profunda branch accompany- ing the musculo-spiral nerve as it passes backwards into the musculo-spiral groove ; a little lower down is the inferior profimda branch accompanying the ulnar nerve down to the interval between the ole- cranon and inner condyle of the humerus, where both become concealed by the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle; and a little above the elbow the anastomotic branch will be seen extending inwards on the brachiahs anti- cus. Also various muscular twigs are to be noted, and the nutrient branch entering the humerus near the level of the insertion of the coraco-bracliialis.'^ ' The artery of the upper limb is so subject to variations that it is right to attract the dissector's atteation to those which he is most liable to meet with. The median nerve may be behind the vessel, and the subscapular, the two circumflex, and the two profunda arteries may all arise together from a common trunk. Frequently the brachial artery divides at a high, level (or the division may even take place in the axilla), and the artery prematurely separated may be the radial; or the usually situated trunk may furnish the radial and the

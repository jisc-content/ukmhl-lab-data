DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 143 each side. The posterior wall may then be divided by an incision across its lower part, carried upwards at each extremity close to the entrance of the veins. The freedom of the whole auricle from musculi pec- tinati, save only in the appendix, will be seen, and s6me irregular depressions opposite the interauricular septum. A probe may be passed from the right au- ricle forwards under cover of the annulus ovalis, and in many instances will pass into the left auricle through a narrow channel, the remains of the foetal foramen ovale. The arch of the aorta may now be cut across in the middle of its ascending part, and, while the superficial cardiac nerves are still left intact, those passing down in front of the trachea to form the deep plexus may be dissected fully out; the cardiac ganglion may be found close between the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the plexus may be traced onwards to the coronary vessels, on which the nerves have already been exposed. The pulmonary artery and veins and the vena cava superior being then divided, the heart will be removed from the body. The competency of the arterial valves, both aortic and pulmonary, may be tested by pouring water into the vessels ; and the three dilatations, or sinuses of Valsalva, opposite the three pouches of the valve in each artery, may be examined. The auricles may then be removed, note being taken of the complete absence of continuity of their muscular fibres with those of the ventricles. The auriculo-ventricular openings will then be seen lying side by side, with the aortic orifice between and in front of them, and

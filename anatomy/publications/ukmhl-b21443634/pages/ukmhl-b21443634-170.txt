156 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. three or four places where it is crossed by tendinous intersections, and those adhesions must be divided without injury to the muscle. The anterior wall of the sheath can then be turned outwards and inwards, the structure of the linea alba separating the sheaths of opposite sides can be examined, and the muscle may be raised from the posterior wall of the sheath. In the lower part of the sheath, ascending from the pubes to the linea alba, is the 2yyramidcdis muscle, in front of the rectus. The series of lower intercostal nerves will be seen piercing the rectus muscle ; and underneath it, entering the sheath from the outside, in the lower part, is the o^eep ejngastric artery, which ought to be traced in its course up through the muscle ; while the superior epigastric, coming from the internal mammary, may be traced in the muscle from above downwards, and in many instances its anastomosis with the deep epigastric will be easily exhibited. The structure of the sheath of the rectus muscle is to be examined by raising the dissected portions of the oblique muscles, and observing the splitting of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and the union of its divisions with the aponeuroses of the external oblique and transversalis muscles in front and behind the rectus. Also in the lower part of its extent is to be noted the extreme weakness of the posterior wall of the sheath. The lower margin â– of the strong upper portion of the posterior waU of the sheath, which, it will be noticed, corresponds pretty closely with a line drawn between the most prominent parts of the iliac crests, is called the fold of Douglas, The deep epigastric artery enters the

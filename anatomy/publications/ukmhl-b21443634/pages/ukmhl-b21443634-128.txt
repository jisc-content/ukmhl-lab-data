114 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. as to get a complete view of the Gasserian ganglion and of the motor root of the nerve passing under the ganglion to join the third or inferior maxillary division ; but the artery should not be much inter- fered with, if the carotid and cavernous plexuses of the sympathetic are to be afterwards sought; and, indeed, the best plan is to leave the sinus on one side uninjured for that dissection. The 2^'>'tuitary body may be removed from the sella turcica and examined. By stripping the dura mater from the bone, the trunk of the middle meningeal artery, after entering the skull, may be brought into view ; and in well-injected subjects it may be possible to see the branch to the hiatus Fallopii, the small meningeal branch entering by the foramen ovale, the anterior ^neningeal artery entering by the side of the cribriform plate from the ethmoidal artery, the j^osterior meningeal branch of the occipital artery entering by the jugular foramen, and meningeal branches of the vertebral artery, 13. The Orbit.â€”The frontal bone should be di- vided with the saw, either vertically or in a direction downwards and outwards, so as to open into the orbit near its inner side, immediately external to the fovea trochlearis, and care must be taken not to direct the edge of the sa^w inwards lest the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve be injured as it passes through the anterior internal orbital canal. Another saw- cut should be made through the side of the skull, downwards and forwards, to the sphenoidal fissure ; the ascending process of the malar bone should be divided with the bone-nippers ; the piece of bone between the saw-cuts is then to be separated by a-

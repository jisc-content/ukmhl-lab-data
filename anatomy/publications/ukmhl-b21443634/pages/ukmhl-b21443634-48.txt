34 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. with which the skin is bound down to it will be noted. The central or principal part will be seen to exjDand towards the fingers ; and at the further end transverse fibres will be observed binding its slips together. A thinner part will be found dying away on each side over the region of the thumb and little finger, and care must be taken to preserve on the inner side of the hand the transverse fibres of the jjalmaris brevis muscle, extending transversely from the palmar fascia to the skin at the edge of the palm. Continuing the dissection down to the fingers, a view will be obtained of the sheaths of the flexor tendons, consisting of almost cartilaginously strong transverse fibres opposite the first and second phalanges, and of little more than some delicate crucial bands over the joints. Also the anterior digital nerves and arteries running down the sides of the fingers, after escaping from underneath the palmar fascia, may be at once dissected out, and note should be taken of the Paci- nian bodies coming ofi" like minute bunches of grapes from the nerves, and usually capable of being easily distinguished from the fat in which they are im- bedded. On reflection of the palmar aponeurosis the siqjer- Jicial palmar arch of artery and the median and ulnar nerves will be laid bare. The superficial palmar arch will be found to be continuous with the ulnar artery, and to be completed by anastomosis with the superficial volar branch of the radial, and to give off" at its commencement a deep branch, which sinks down between the muscles of the little finger, and after- wards the digital branches for the three inner fingers

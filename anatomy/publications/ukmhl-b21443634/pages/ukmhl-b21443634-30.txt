16 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. lowest insertions of that muscle : and to show the upper part of the multifidus spinje, ascending as iiigh as the axis, the semispinalis must be divided in its whole extent. The multifidus spinse by dissection inwards from its outer attachments may be shown to consist of a series of fan-shaped parts; the outer fibres are most superficial and pass over several verte- br£e, deeper fibres are shorter, while the deepest of all in the dorsal region extend between contiguous vertebrse and are called rotatores spince. After the study of these, the levatores costarum, small muscles extending outwards and downwards from the extremi- ties of the dorsal transverse processes, and connected with the fibres of the external intercostal muscles, claim attention. In series with the levatores costa- rum, in the lumbar region, are the exteo'nal intertrans- verse muscles, between succeeding.transverse processes, while a set of internal intertransverse muscles will be found passing from accessory to mammillary processes. Typical intertransversales muscles, and also inter- spinals muscles exist in the neck. 2. The Spinal Cord.—Senior dissectors may now proceed to exhibit the spinal cord by opening the spinal canal. The laminjB of the vertebrae are to be denuded of muscle ; the head is to be allowed to hang over the end of the table, and the concavity of the lumbar part of the vertebral column is to be straight- ened as much as possible, by means of blocks under the abdomen. The laminae of the lumbar and dorsal region are then to be divided partially with the saw, care being taken to direct the saw somewhat inwards, so as not to divide the ti-ansverse processes instead of

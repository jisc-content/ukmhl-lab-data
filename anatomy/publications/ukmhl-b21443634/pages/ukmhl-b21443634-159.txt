DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 1 45 exhibited, and the mucous membrane is then to be divided, and its glandular orifices and longitudinal markings noted. The bronchi and succeeding tubes should be examined by slitting them open to show the mucous membrane. Sections should also be made through healthy portions of the lung, to familiarise the eye with the appearance of the vessels and bron- chial tubes in section and the framework of connec- tive tissue between the lobules ; and the lightness of the tissue may be tested by throwing portions into water. 5. The CEsophagus and other Parts.â€”The struc- tures in the posterior mediastinum now demand further attention. The aorta and termination of the left vena azygos can be more fully displayed, the oesophagus can be properly cleaned, its curves can be seen, and the right and left pneumogastric nerves can be exliibited on it. The thoracic duct is to be fol- lowed up, if this has not been already done ; and, by an arrangement with the dissectors of the head and neck, it may be pursued round the apex of the left lung to its termination in the angle of junction of the left subclavian and left internal jugular vein. Then the lower part of the thoracic portion of the sym- pathetic chain, together with the greater and smaller splanchnic nerves, should be traced to their passage through the diaphragm ; and the diaphragm itself may be examined, so far as it can be seen from the thorax. Lastly, the articulations of the ribs and dorsal vertebrae are to be dissected out. Sometimes it will happen that the dissectors of the abdomen have by

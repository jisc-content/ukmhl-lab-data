104 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. nerve, and in front of this the uppermost branch of the facial nerve, emerging from underneath the parotid gland and directed towards the forehead and angle of the eyelids. The temporal division of the temporo-malar nerve is to be sought for on the surface, about an inch above the zygoma and a little behind the margin of the orbit. Also at this time the attrahens and attollens aurem muscles, in front of and above the ear, are to be dissected, if not already seen with the dissection of the back of the scalp. If the incision above the ear be now prolonged downwards in front of it to join the dissection in the neck, the remaining integument of the face may be removed from behind forwards toward the middle line. The outline of the parotid gland prolonged a little over the jaw, with the duct (Stenson's) extend- ing forwards from it to enter the mouth, is to be brought into view ; also the little outlying portion of the gland termed soda jjarotidis, and the transverse facial branch of the temporal artery above the duct and the various remaining trunks of the facial nerve issuing from beneath the anterior border of the gland and diverging as they pass forward ; also the minute malar branch of the sujoerior maxillary nerve emerg- ing from a foramen on the front of the malar bone. The continuation of the platysma myoides is to be followed over the jaw, and its posterior fibres may be traced to the angle of the mouth, forming the risorius viuscle of Santorini. Two muscular slips, the zygomaticus major and minor, are next to be exliibited descending from the malar prominence to the angle of the mouth ; and internal to them, arising beneath

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 37 princeps poUicis and radial branch of the index finger given off from the radial artery as it enters the hand. 9. The Back of the Forearm and Hand.â€”The remaining integuments being removed, the super- ficial veins and the distribution of the radial and ulnar nerves on the back of the hand will be followed out; the radial nerve supplymg two fingers and a half completely, and the ulnar supplying the little finger and ulnar side of the ring finger, while the adjacent sides, of the middle and ring fingers are usually supplied by a trunk formed partly from both nerves. The aponeurosis is to be afterwards removed from the back of the forearm, care being taken to preserve at the back of the wrist a thickened portion, the posterior annular ligament, which is fastened to the lower ends of the radius and ulna by septa, which form a series of compartments, through which the extensor tendons pass. A series of seven muscles will be observed to radiate from the outer edge of the humerus, the outermost of which is the supinator longiLS, already dissected; while intei-nal to it, in series from without inwards, lie the extensores carpi radiales longior et brevior, the extensor communis digi- torum, the extensor minimi digiti, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and, on the inner and upper border of this, the anconeus, already dissected. The others are to be dissected now; and the compartment occupied by each tendon in the posterior annular ligament at the back of the wrist is to be studied. The extensor minimi digiti will be distinguished by its passing through a separate compartment of the annular ligament,

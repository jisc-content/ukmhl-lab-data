164 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. abdominal cavity is to be thoroughly opened by the completion of a crucial incision extending longitudi- nally from sternum to pubes, and through the umbili- cus from side to side. The position of the viscera should be first examined. Above, in the right hypo- chondriac and the epigastric region, is the liver; and the extent which it occupies is to be noted. In the left hypochondriac and the epigastric region is the stomach, varying in bulk according to the degree of inflation ; and when the cardiac extremity of the stomach is raised, the spleen, attached to it well back on the left, will be brought into view. Below the stomach, connected closely by peritoneum with its pyloric end, the transverse colon crosses the front of the abdomen ; and between it and the great curva- ture of the stomach is the pendulous great or gastro- colic omentum, sometimes hanging down over the colon and small intestines, and sometimes crumpled up in small bulk. Following the transverse colon to the right, and turning the small intestines a little to the left, the student will see the hepatic flexure where the ascending colon is continued into the transverse^ and below this he will feel the right kidney ; and pursuing the ascending colon downwards, he will find the intestinum ccecum consisting of cajmt coicuvi coli and vermiform aiopendage in the right iliac region. Let him observe the termination of the small intestine in the csecum, turn the transverse colon and gi-eat omentum upwards, and follow the small intestine up from the termination of the ileum, throwing it to the right side till he arrives at the commencement of the jejunum, which he will recognise from its being the

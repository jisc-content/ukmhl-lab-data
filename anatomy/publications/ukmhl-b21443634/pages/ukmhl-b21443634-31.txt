DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 17 opening into the spinal canal. The saw-cuts ought to be continued downwai'ds and made to meet near the lower end of the sacrum ; the divided portion of the sacrum should be raised with the chisel, and the series of laminae removed from below upwards in a continuous chain united by the ligamenta suhflava, by completing their division with the bone-nippers. The extensibility and resiliency of the ligamenta subflava will thus be exhibited. The sheath of dura mater, with its prolongations round'the nerves, can now be cleared with the handle of the scalpel so as to show the spinal ganglia, and in some instances (most conveniently in the lower dorsal region) the nerves may be traced out to show their bifurcation into anterior and posterior divisions. The dura mater is to be carefully opened by slitting it down the middle : and then will be seen the origins of the spinal nerves in pairs by anterior and posterior roots, the ligamenta denticulata binding the cord to the dura mater in the spaces between the successive nerves, and the delicate arachnoid membrane sur- rounding the spinal cord. The loose transparent sheath which the arachnoid forms round the cauda equina, or collected bundle of lumbar and sacral nerves, can be exhibited advantageously with the aid of the bloAvpipe, or by introducing the handle of the scalpel beneath it ; and when it has been laid open, the cord is seen closely invested with its vascular sheath, the pia mater, and terminating in the filum terminale, a silvery thread which will be found among the trunks of the Cauda equina, and is to be followed to its attachment.

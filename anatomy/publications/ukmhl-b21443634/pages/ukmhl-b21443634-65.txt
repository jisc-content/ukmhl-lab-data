DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 51 been turned, and the pelvis supported with blocks, the examination of the parts concerned in femoral hernia will be the first thing to occupy the dissector of the lower limb. An incision should be carried in- wards along the fold of the groin from the anterior superior spine of the ilium ; from the inner end of the first incision another should be cari-ied down- wards for about four inches ; and from the lower end of this a third should be carried outwards trans- versely.' The integument having been reflected out- wards, the subcutaneous fat or superficial fascia is to be removed in like manner, care being taken not to pass so high as to interfere with the fascia of the groin to be dissected by the dissector of the abdomen. In doing this, the lymphatic glands and all vessels and nerves are to be left undisturbed. The lymphatic glands will be seen to form two groups; the upper group oblique, and receiving lymphatics from the in- teguments of the abdomen, the lower part of the back and genital organs, the lower group vertical, and re- ceiving the superficial lymphatics of the limb. The trunk of the long or internal saphenous vein is seen ascending, receiving usually a large tributary on its inner side, and disappearing from view above. Also some smaller vessels are brought into view, namely, the superficial epigastric artery and vein passing up- wards on the abdomen, the superficial circuirfiex iliac passing outwards and upwards, and the sup)erior and inferior superficial pudic extending inwards, Super- ' The upper of these three incisions may be omitted if the dissection be arranged in concert with that of the groin, made by the dissectors of the abdomen.

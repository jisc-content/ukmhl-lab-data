DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 66 the musculo-mtaneous nerve piercing the fascia lata. On the dorsum of the foot the arch of vein from which the external and internal saphenous take origin will be seen ; the external saphenous nerve will be traced principally to the outer and also to the inner side of the little toe, the internal saplienous nerve to the inner side of the foot, and the musculo- cutaneous nerve to the inner side of the great toe and the adjacent sides of the second and third, of the third and fourth, and of the fourth and fifth toes]; while the anterior tibial nerve will be found becoming cutaneous between the first and second metatarsal bones, and supplying digital branches to the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. The aponeurosis is now to be removed, with the exception of the bands constituting the anterior an- nular ligament. Of these, the most important forms a strong loop round the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius muscles, and is attached to the fore part of the calcaneum in the hollow between it and the astragalus ; somewhat irregular bands con- tinue inwards from this loop, the strongest band passing superficial to the extensor pollicis and on the deep surface of the tibialis anticus. The upper part of the aponeurosis of the leg had better be removed from below upwards, as it gives origin on its deep isurface to muscular fibres. The four muscles of the front of the leg are now to be dissected fully out. Two of them are seen in the whole extent of the leg, namely, the tibialis anticus internally, and the extensor longus digitorum externally; continuous with the lower border of the latter is the origin of the p)eronetis

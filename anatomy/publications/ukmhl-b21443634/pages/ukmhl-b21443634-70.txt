DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 56 joint. Behind the tensor vaginae femoris are the re- maining parts of the gluteus medius and minimus, and when the gluteus medius is reflected the branch of tlie gluteal nerve to the tensor vaginae may be seen. The tensor vaginae femoris is to be divided, and the gluteus medius and minimus are to be thoroughly dissected to their attachments, to show the precise extent of their insei"tions, as well as the bursa between them and the great trochanter, and the arch of fibres, by means of which the gluteus minimus is connected with the upper part of the capsule of the hip-joint. Above the hip-joint the jwsterior or reflected tendon of the rectus femoris is again seen, and the whole of this muscle may be now dissected out and the direction of its fibres noted. Also the three other parts of the quadrice2)s extensor cruris, of which the rectus forms a part, may be displayed, namely, the vastus externus and internus, with their fibres directed respectively downwards and inwards and downwards and outwards, and the straight-fibred crureus be- tween them. Along with the muscles on the outside of the thigh there ought also to be dissected the as- cending, transverse, and descending branches of the external circu,mflex artery anastomosing, the former two with the gluteal and perforating, and the latter with the arteries around the knee. The branches of the anterior crural nerve may now be dissected out continuously from the parent trunk, and will be seen to fall naturally into two groups, a superficial cutaneous set whose only mus- cular branches are those to the sartorius and pecti- neus, and a deep set which, with the exception of the

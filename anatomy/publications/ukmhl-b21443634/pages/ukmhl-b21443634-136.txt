122 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the place where it turns downwards, and to show the great and small superficial petrosal nerves joining its geniculate ganglion ; and in doing this the cochlea and vestibule will be more or less fully exposed. The fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda should be looked at from the vestibular side, and the mode noted in which the stapes is pressed inwards at the former when the handle of the malleus is pulled in. After- wards, the descending part of the aquseductus Fallopii may be laid open, and at the same time the muscular belly of the stapedius muscle, which lies close to the facial nerve, may be exposed, as also the origin of the chorda tymp)ani from the facial nerve. The styloid process should now be nipped across, and together with the muscles attached to it should be turned forwards ; the upper parts of the glosso- pharyngeal, vagus and spinal accessory nerves should be dissected out, and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus should be traced from its origin to its destina- tion. The remaining portion of the temporal bone bounding the jugular fossa should be separated and carefully raised, and in doing this it is possible to find the a/Liricular branch of the vagus {Arnold's) entering the bone ; and the tympanic branch of the glosso- pharyngeal nerve (Jacobson's) may possibly be seen entering the spiculum between the jugular fossa and carotid canal. The carotid canal should be fully laid open, so as to enable the part of the bone external to it to be everted and expose completely in the foramen lacerum posticum the passage of the eighth lierve out of the cranium, and the connections of its parts ; also the p)etrous and jugular ganglia of the

18 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. By dividing the cord and dura mater above, and the nerves as they leave the spinal canal, the whole may be removed and spread out for further examination; and some at least of the nerve-roots should be followed through the dura mater to show the relations of the two roots to the ganglia. Lastly, if the subject be quite fresh, sections may be made through the cord at different levels ; or, if the subject has been long pre- served in salt, an interesting result may be obtained by running water on the cut upper end of the cord, and thus removing its proper texture, while the pia mater will be left empty, but with the firm roots of the nerves attached toj it in series in front and behind. Within the spinal canal after removal of the cord, the rich plexus of veins should be noted. 3. The Pectoral Eegion and Axilla.â€”The subject having been turned on its back, and the shoulders supported by a block, so as to throw the chest for- wards, a mesial incision is to be made along the ster- num ; from the upper end of this another is to be car- ried to the outer end of the clavicle, and thence along the arm to the fold of the axilla; while a third is to be directed transversely from the lower end of the sternum, as far as the border of the latissimus dorsi. If the subject be a female, a circular incision with a radius of an inch is to be described round the mammilla, so as to leave that part intact when the rest of the integument is raised. The extent of the mamma is to be exhibited by removal of the sur- rounding adipose tissue ; and on raising the circular portion of integument till it is left attached only at

160 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. either corresponds in position with the obliterated hypogastric, or lies a little to the outside of it, so as to leave an intermediate little peritoneal fossa between it and that structure. Now an oblique inguinal hernia, leaving the abdominal cavity at the deep abdominal ring, follows the course of the spermatic cord as far as the superficial ring, and that course is named the inguinal canal; while, on the other hand, a direct inguinal hernia leaves the abdomen internal to the epigastric artery, either passing internal to the obliterated hypogastric also, or, in the event of an intermediate fossa existing, passing down through it, external to the obliterated vessel : the student will therefore take note of the relations which each form of hernia must necessarily have to surrounding parts, especially to the epigastric artery which is internal to an oblique hernia and external to a direct ; and he will observe what structures will be pushed before the hernia so as to form its coverings. The fascia transversalis and subperitoneal fat of the groin are now to be turned aside from the pei*i- toneum which is to be detached from them and from the deep side of Poupart's ligament. By this means a view will be obtained, from the inside, of the re- lations of the transversalis fascia bound down to Poupart's ligament below, and the iliac fascia reach- ins that structure from the iliac fossa, and also of the parts involved in the descent of a femoral hernia. Over the external iliac artery and vein, where they are continuous with the femoral vessels, an arch formed by the fascia transversalis will be seen, the deep crural arch, and on the inside of the artery a

118 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. to the surgical rules ; but on one side the duct should be left uninjured for future examination.^ 14. Deep Dissections of Nerves and the Internal Ear.â€”The contents of the orbit having been removed^ the foramen rotundum and infra-orbital canal are to be carefully laid open with the bone-nippers, to ex- hibit the superior maxillary nerve and its branches. Opposite the spheno-maxillary fossa this nerve gives off the temporo-malar branch, which must be sought for near the anterior part of the outer wall of the orbit before that portion of the bone is I'emoved ; two communicating branches to Meckel's ganglion are next detached ; immediately in front of these the two posterior dental branches will be found descending on the tuberosity of the upper jawbone, while in the fore part of the infra-orbital canal is given off the anterior dental branch. Eor the purpose of examining the posterior dental branches the outer part of the orbital wall may be removed entirely, and afterwards the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone may be nipped away with the bone-nippers till the anterior wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa is removed. There will then be obtained a view of the sjyheno-maxillarg or Meckel's ganglion, with the nasal and naso-imla- tine branches passing through the spheno-palatine foramen, the tliree palatine branches, one of them much larger than the others, extending downwards, and the Vidian nerve, with the minute branch termed ' When the dissection of the orbit has been completed the eyeball may be removed and preserved in spirit and water for fature examination, according tn the directions given at- page 129,

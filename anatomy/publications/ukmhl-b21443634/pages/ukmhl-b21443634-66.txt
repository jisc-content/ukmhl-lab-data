52 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. ficial to the position of the femoral artery, the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve makes its appear- ance ; and more internally some small twigs of the ilio-inguinal nerve. The fascia where the internal saphenous vein dis- appears is to be carefully cleared, the ducts and other sbructures connected with the lymphatic glands over it being preserved ; and it will be found to consist of comparatively loose structure embracing the saphe- nous vein, perforated by the ducts and blood-vessels of the lymphatic glands and connected round about with the firmer fascia lata ; this is the cribriform fascia. Passing the handle of the scalpel in under- neath the saphenous vein where it dips in to join the femoral, a well-defined margin of the fascia lata will be found beneath it, namely, the inferior falciform jjrocess of the saphenous opening. Following this margin upwards and outwards it will be found to be- come less defined, being continued into the cribriform fascia ; but it becomes again more defirdte above and internal to the entrance of the vein, where it forms the superior falciform p)Tocess. The part of the fascia lata external to this opening is what is called the iliac portion, while the part internal to it, in which the superior and inferior falciform processes terminate, and which, between these processes, is continued underneath the femoral vessels, is what is termed the pubic portion. The limits of the saphenous opening having been examined, its outer border may be divided, when the femoral artery and vein sur- rounded by the crural sheath will be fully brought into view ; and if two incisions be made through the

132 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK tunica media (of which the choroid is the posterior and the iris the anterior portion) with the sclerotic may be examined. Between the sclerotic and cho- roid will be found the divided ciliary nerves derived from the lenticular ganglion. Let the connection of the iris and choroid with the sclerotic be gently- broken up with the handle of the scalpel, so as to detach them from the outer coat of the eye, and at the place of connection there will be seen a white ring between choroid and iris, the ciliary viuscle, and in front of this a canal opened into, the circular sinus, in front of which is a very delicate torn edge, the ligamentiompectinaticm. The iris in the ox differs from that of the human subject in having a horizontally elongated pupil, and in the circular muscular fibres round the pupil being much more distinctly separated from the radiating fibres at the circumference. Sec- tions should be made to show the passage of the sclerotic into the cornea, and the lamination of the cornea. The laminae are considerably separated when bichromate of potash is used. Turning now to the lens and forepart of the vitreous humour, there is seen a series of plications, zonule of Zinn, corresponding with the ciliary pro- cesses ; and if a blowpipe or nozzle of a syringe be introduced between these plications, close to the lens, and air or colouring matter introduced, a demonstra- tion will be had of the canal of Petit, bounded in front by the suspensory ligament. If a slight score be then made on the front of the lens, its capside will be ruptured, the crystalline lens will fall out, and both lens and capsule may be fully examined.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 167 coming up from the umbilicus. Then turning to the under surface of the liver, it will be seen that it is clothed with peritoneum back to its posterior margin at the two sides, and that at the right and left ex- tremity the peritoiieum meets back to back with the folds proceeding from the upper surface, so as to form the right and left triangular ligaments; but in the region between these two ligaments it will be observed that there is a large extent of thick posterior border where the folds from above and below do not meet; and this broad attachment is what is called the coro- nary ligament. In the middle of the under surface the peritoneum does not pass back to the posterior border of the liver, but is reflected about half-way- back, at the 2^ortal fissure, to the pylorus and com- mencement of the duodenum, so that a portion of the under surface is concealed. But on the right side of this reflection, between it and the posterior wall of the abdomen, is an opening, the foramen of Wins- low, which admits the finger into a cavity expanding behind the stomach and bounded by the concealed part of the liver above. The reflection of peritoneum in front of the foramen of Winslow is the gastro- hepatic or small omentum; the concealed lobe of liver is the lobulus Spigelii; and the cavity into which the foramen of Winslow expands is the sac of the great omentum, or smaller sac of the peritoneum. This sac is now to be opened, and this can be done very effectu- ally and without injury to any important structure by an incision four or five inches long immediately below the arteries running along the great curvature of the stomach. It will be found then that the sac

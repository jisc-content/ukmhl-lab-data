148 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. himself that on each side of the anus there is a hollow filled with fat, the ischio-rectal fossa, while in front there is a firm boundary of fascia and other structures. A cut from before backwards being made down into the middle of the right fossa, it will be seen that a superficial pad of fat is separated from a deeper layer, and that in the plane of separation are the inferior hcemorrJioidal vessels and the pos- terior twig of the j^erinceal branch of the pudic nerve, on their way to the surface. After finding a,nd fol- lowing these structures, the walls of the fossa should be exhibited, namely, on the outside the obturator fascia, the margin of the gluteus viaximus muscle behind, and internally the levator ani and coccygeus muscles covered by the anal fascia. Emerging be- tween the levator ani and coccygeus muscles, a small branch from the fourth sacral nerve will be found coming to the surface. In front, the dissector should be satisfied, at this stage of the dissection, with feel- ing the position of the staff in the membranous portion of the urethra, and should beware of in- juring the fasciee. This dissection should be repeated on the left side of the body; and in doing this the dissector will do well first to divide the fat filling the fossa, as it would be divided in the lateral opera- tion of lithotomy, and to note the depth to which such an incision might be carried, and feel the posi- tion of the groove of the stafi" between the bulb of the urethra and the prostate. The mesial incision should then be prolonged forwards, and the integu- ment reflected from the anterior division of the peri- nseum.

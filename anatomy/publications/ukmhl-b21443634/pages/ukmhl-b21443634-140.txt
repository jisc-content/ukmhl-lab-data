126 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. of the larynx, and the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves should be dissected out, so as to exhibit the muscular branches of the latter and the communi- cation of the two nerves under cover of the thyroid cartilage. On the back of the cricoid cartilage will be seen the two posterior crico-arytenoid muscles ; above them, on the arytenoid cartilages, the transverse fibres of the arytenoideus; and, on its surface, the decussate oblique bands of the aryteno-ejnglottidei muscles. On further removing the mucous mem- brane the cornicula taryngis (cartilages of Santorini) will be seen surmounting the arytenoid cartilages and the cuneiform cartilages of Wrisberg producing a swelling in the epiglottidean fold in front of them. The form of the cartilages of the larynx is to be studied, and the crico-arytenoid and crico-thyroid articulations and the movements which they permit. The thyro-hyoid membrane and lateral ligaments are also to be examined, and the hyoid bone and remains of the tongue may then be removed. The epiglottis may be dissected out so as to show its form and connections at the base. To see the remaining muscles of the larynx, the greater part of one half of the thyroid cartilage may be removed by a vertical incision near the middle line, carried down to about a line from the lower border, and another directed backwards from this, when the upper attachment of the crico-thyroid mu^cYQ will be seen more fully. Tlie fibres of the lateral â€¢crico-arytenoid muscle will be observed converging to the outer angle of the arytenoid cartilage, and, above it, passing backwards to the base of the same car- tilage, the thyro-arytenoid muscle occupying the fold

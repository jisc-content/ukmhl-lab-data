DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 101 and the nerve to the subclavius muscle already pre- served :â€”from the back of the cord formed by union of the anterior divisions of the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, the suprasca2mktr nei"ve ; from the same two trunks before they join, the 2^osterior thoracic nerve {external respiratory nerve of Bell) destined for the serratus magnus muscle ; and from the back part of the fifth, the branch for the rhomboid muscles. The first part of the subclavian artery, internal to the scalenus anticus mviscle, now demands attention ; and the arrangement of this, as well as the lower part of the common carotid artery, is to be compared on the right and left sides of the body. But before proceeding with this, the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins to form the right or left innominate vein is to be seen to ; and the angle of junction between the subclavian and internal jugular veins is to be carefully dissected in search, on the left side, for the thoracic duct which curves forwards and downwards to open at this point, and on the right side for the short and much smaller though corresponding structure, the right thoracic duct. In the dissection of the left side arrangement ought to be made with the dissectors of the thorax to see the thoracic duct in its continuity. The vagus nerve is to be followed down ; and on the right side, after crossing the subclavian artery, it will be seen to give oS its recurrent laryngeal branch. On both sides the recurrent laryngeal nerve will be found passing up in the angle between the trachea and oesophagus. One or two branches of the sym- pathetic may pass in front of the right subclavian

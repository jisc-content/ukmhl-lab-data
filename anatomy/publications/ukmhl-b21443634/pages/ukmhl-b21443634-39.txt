DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 25 SO as to pass partly on to its surface and partly beneath it, should be noted. When the deltoid muscle has been properly studied, so far as it can be seen on its outer aspect, it should be divided near its origin ; the large bursa beneath it, extending between the acromion and the shoulder-joint, should be in- spected, and the posterior circuviflex artery and the circumflex nerve should be displayed on the deep surface of the deltoid, and the extent of the insertion of the muscle made distinct. At this stage also the attachment of the long head of the tricejjs muscle of the arm into the axillary border of the scapula should be fully displayed, and the manner should be noticed in which it subdivides the interval between the scapula, teres major and neck of the humerus, leaving a quadrangular space above, through which the cir- cumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery pass backwards, and a triangular space below, through which the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery takes its course. The investing aponeurosis is to be removed from the infraspinatus muscle, and that muscle is to be distinguished from the teres minor which lies on its axillary border. The nerve to the teres minor is to be traced from the circumflex, and its gangliform swelling noted : and then the teres major and minor muscles may be studied together, so as to show their antagonistic actions in rotating the humerus when elevated. The supraspinatus muscle, occupying the fossa supraspinata, is to be dissected out in its course beneath the acromion, which, however, does not interfere with its exposure. It is then to be raised from its origin, and the sujjra-

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 133 While one eyeball is examined in the easy way now described, on the other the tunics may be re- moved in series. For this purpose the first incision into the sclerotic should be made well forward where it is thinnest; and in carrying the cut made with the scissors round about, care must be taken not to in- jure the choroid ; and the ciliary nerves also may be preserved. A cut may then be made back to the optic nerve ; the sclerotic may be everted ; and then it may be cut away close to the optic nerve. The forepart of the sclerotic, with the cornea, may then be detached as in the former dissection, if the dis- sector chooses. The choroid is next to be removed. It can be torn away easily in shreds, the tears taking a direction from before backwards determined by the course of the arterioles which constitute an im- portant part of its structure. A view will thus be obtained of the retina in its position on the surface of the vitreous humour ; and on removing the retina, the vitreous humour, the lens and the transparent membranes will be obtained intact. If the student has been careful in his manipula- tions a dissection similar to either of those above described may be made in the eyeball of the subject. The sclerotic and cornea may be thoroughly ex- amined, and the ciliary nerves may be traced. The choroid, iris, and ciliary muscle may be displayed ; and when the eyeball is opened, the lens with its capsule and the hyaloid can be easily separated. The retina, however, as a rule cannot be exhibited.

60 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. will be found on the inner side of the leg. The apo- neurosis of the limb being removed, the muscles of the calf are seen, namely, the gastrocnemius, and under- neath it the soleus appearing at the sides. When they have been cleaned, the gastrocnemius may be divided near its upper part and its heads of origin may be separated and dissected closely up to the femur, so as to show the transverse position of the line of origin of the inner head and the longitu- dinal and lower position of the outer head. Beneath the inner head and separating it from the tendon of the semi-membranosus a bursa is found which usually communicates with the knee-joint. The tendinous expansions on the opposed surfaces of the soleus and gastrocnemius are to be noted, and between them the tendon of the plantar is muscle, which may be di- vided. The plantaris muscle is sometimes absent. The jjopliteal artery is now laid thoroughly bare as far as the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into anterior and jjosterior tibial; its relation to the internal popliteal nerve at the lower part can be more fully seen ; and the 7ierve from the internal popliteal to the p)opliteus muscle is to be found descending outside the vessels to the lower border of the muscle, beneath which it turns ; also the branch to the soleus, which is of larger size, -will be followed down. The popliteus muscle will be observed to be covered with an aponeurosis, which may be either raised at the present stage or left un- touched till the knee-joint is dissected, as until then the femoral attachment and the action of the popli- teus cannot be properly studied.

186 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. name, but sometimes replaced by a branch from the epigastric ; the pudic quitting the pelvis by the great sciatic notch, beneath the pyriformis muscle, and re- entering below the spine of the ischium, and now to be followed in its course bound down by the obturator fascia till it terminates in the dorsal artery of the penis and artery of the corpus cavernosum ; the sciatic likewise passing below the pyriformis ; the gluteal emerging above the pyriformis ; the ilio-lumbar dividing into lumbar and iliac branches which anas- tomose with the last lumbar and circumflex iliac respectively ; and the lateral sacral descending on the sacrum and giving off branches which enter the anterior sacral foramina. In following the branches of the internal iliac artery, the dissector will meet with the principal trunks of the sacral j^Igxus. He will see the forma- tion of this plexus by the union of the lumbo-sacral cord with the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves, and part of the fourth; much the greater part of the plexus joining to form the great sciatic nerve, which with the small sciatic emerges below the pyriformis. He will dissect the gluteal nerve, which emerges with the gluteal artery, and trace it to its origin from the lumbo-sacral cord. He will then follow the jmdic nerve from its origin to its distribu- tion, and will complete the superficial dissection of the penis by the complete removal of the integument,, displaying the dorsal arteries and nerves, and follow- ing the dorsal veins back through the ti'iangular ligament, then laying bare the fibrous exterior of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, and dis-

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 89 front is the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle. The posterior cornu, extending back in the posterior lobe, is to be laid open in its whole length, and on its inner side will be seen an elevation, the hi2Jpocam2ms minor, which may be shown to correspond with the calcarine fissure. The middle or descending cornu is marked by the choroid plexus and piosterior crus of the fornix passing into it, and is to be exhibited in its whole length, on one side, by placing the point of the knife in the cornu and cutting upwards outside the corpus striatum, and freely in the outward direc- tion, so as to remove a large block of the hemisphere. By this section the striated structure from which the corpus striatum is named is exhibited : and in the descending cornu are seen the elevation termed hip- 2Jocam2ms major, the toinia hi2J2^ocam2n or corpus firnhriatum internal to it continued down from the posterior crus of the fornix, and the choroid 2Jlexus j also at the extremity of the cornu, the pes hippocam2n, the expanded and digitated extremity of the hippo- campus major. The corpus callosum is now to be cut across about an inch from the posterior border ; the septum lucidum in front of this is to be divided with scissors, and the part of the corpus callosum thus liberated is to be reflected forwards or removed. Between the two layers of the septum lucidum the fifth ventricle can now be seen ; a view is also obtained of the whole upper surface of the fornix. -For the removal of the fornix the best mode of proceeding is to make two cuts, severing the remain- ing posterior parts of the corpus callosum from the hemispheres. Each cut should be directed forwards

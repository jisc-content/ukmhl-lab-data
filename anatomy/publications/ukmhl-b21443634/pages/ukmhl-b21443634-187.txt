DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 173 iiig peritoneum of the small omentum, and bring fully into view the common bile-duct {ductus communis choledochus) to the i-ight of the hepatic artery, and trace up from it the two ducts with which it is con- tinuous, namely, the cystic duct coming from the gall- bladder, and the hepatic duct formed by the union of right and left ducts ; also, behind the duct and artery, the portal vein will be brought into view. At this stage the terminal branches of the right and left pneumogastric nerves should be followed respectively from the back and front of the oesophagus, down on the stomach, and in a good subject filaments may be traced from them to the hepatic, cceliac, and splenic plexuses. The portal vein is then to be traced up to its bifurcation into right and left portal before enter- ing the liver, and backwards to its sources of origin so as to show the veins of the intestines uniting into superior and inferior mesenteric veins, and passing tip behind the pancreas to fall into the splenic vein and to be joined by the coronary vein of the stomach. The manner in which the pancreas is expanded at its right extremity, so as to form what is designated its head, filling up the concavity of the duodenum, is now to be noticed, and by a slight search into the centre of the body of the gland, the main duct of the pancreas will be found. This duct is to be traced through the length of the gland to its termination in the duode- num, close to the bile-duct; and near its termination it will be found joined from below by a smaller duct from the lower part of the head. The liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and spleen are now to be removed ; and for this purpose

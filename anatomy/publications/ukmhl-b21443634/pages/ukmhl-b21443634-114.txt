100 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. along with it is the superior laryngeal nerve, wliich may be traced back towards the pneumogastric. The other offsets of the superior thyroid artery, namely, the inferior hyoid and the crico-tliyroid, having been shown, the termination of the artery in the thyroid body is to be exhibited, and the thyroid body should be dissected fully out, so as to show the whole lateral lobe, the termination of the inferior thyroid artery and the superior and middle thyroid veins. The lingual artery at present can be followed no further than the point where it becomes concealed by passing beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. Imme- diately above it is the facial artery, whose two first branches, the ascending pa^a^we and tonsillar, can now be displayed at their origins. The ascending pharyngeal branch of the external carotid may also be shown at its origin by raising the trunk. Coming off from the external carotid behind are the occijntal and posterior auricular ; the occipital, crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, is to be traced upwards, and the posterior auricular can be followed to its distribution. 8. Deep Dissection of the Root of the Neck.— The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is to be divided, and its attachments are to be thoroughly dissected out. On the fourth day after the subject has been placed on its back, the cla^acle having been di\dded by the dissector of the arm (or removed at the sterno-clavicular articulation, if it has been so agreed on), a view is to be obtained of the passage of the brachial plexus from the neck into the axilla. From the brachial plexus will be seen given off the follow- ing branches above the clavicle, besides the phrenic

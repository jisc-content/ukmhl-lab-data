168 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. of the great omentum descends into the pendulous peritoneum in front of tlie transverse colon, so that the peritoneum in question is simply a much elon- gated omentum or fold joining the stomach to the colon. The continuation of the same layers from the colon to the posterior wall of the abdomen is called the transverse mesocolon. Also the lobuius Spigelii can now be seen, and, in the posterior wall of the sac, the pancreas lying transversely with the splenic artery and vein above it. On thrusting the hand upwards behind the stomach, the gastro-hepatic omentum is seen to be continued on the left into the g astro-phrenic ligament ; and at the left side of the stomach the fold joining that viscus to the spleen is displayed, the gastro-splenic omentum. The peritoneal relations of the duodenum can also now be more fully seen. 5. The Mesenteric Vessels and the Intestines.â€” The transverse colon is to be again thrown upwards against the ribs, and the small intestines are to be turned over to the left side. The exposed layer of peritoneum of the mesentery is then to be stripped off, and the process of stripping is to be continued till the whole series of ramifications of blood-vessels belonging to the jejunum, ileum, and ascending and transverse colon is exposed. The arteries will be seen to emanate from one trunk, the sujjerior nusen- teric, which gives off from one side numerous branches to the small intestine, and from the other the middle colic, right colic, and ileo-colic bi'anches. The main arches of anastomosis and the small arches on their convexities are to be cleared as far as the intestinal

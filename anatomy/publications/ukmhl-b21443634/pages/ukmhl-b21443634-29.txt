DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 15 also some tendinous fibres of connection with tlie lower part of the subjacent semisjnnalis usually re- quire division. Then the longissimus dorsi, constitu- ting the main part of the inner column of the erector spinre, is to have its insertions, as far as possible, indi- vidually dissected out, so as to show that they con- sist of an outer series of muscular slips attached to ribs and lumbar transverse processes, and an inner series, more tendinous, attached to dorsal transverse and lumbar accessory processes. At the upper part, this muscle will be found prolonged into the neck by the transversalis colli, a muscle connected by both origins and insertions with transverse processes and lying close to the border of the splenius ; while the transversalis colli is in turn prolonged to the skull by the trachelo-mastoid muscle already mentioned. The complexits muscle is to be divided, if this has not already been done, by the dissectors of the head and neck. The semispinalis muscle, usually divided into semispinalis dorsi and semispinalis colli, will then be seen with fibres directed upwards and inwards over several vertebrae, extending from transverse processes as low as the middle of the back up to the spine of the axis. Below the lower margin of the semispinalis, which is marked by flat tendons, part of the multifidus spince is visible, a muscle whose fibres likewise pass upwards and inwards, but are much shorter, while the muscle as a whole is greatly longer. To show the lower part of the multifidus spince, the aponeurotic origins of the longissimus dorsi from the lumbar spines and sacrum must be divided, Avhich will likewise permit a more complete dissection being made of the

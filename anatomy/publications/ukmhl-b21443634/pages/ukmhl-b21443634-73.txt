59 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. different positions of the limb are to be noted in con- nection with the subject of dislocations of the joint, namely, its projection forwards in extension with the toes turned outwards, together with the variation caused by adduction, and its projection backwards on turning the toes inwards, with the variations ac- cording to the degree of flexion and adduction. The capsule is afterwards to be opened to show the coty- loid, transverse and round ligaments, and the surfaces of the joint. Sometimes it is preferable, instead of dissecting the hip-joint in this way, to saw through the femur and leave this joint to be dissected by the dissectors of the pelvis, who will have an opportunity of opening into it from the deep surface of the in- nominate bone, so as to show the action of the round ligament without injury to the capsule. 4. The Back of the Leg.â€”The limb having been separated from the trunk, an incision is to be made down the back of the leg as far as the heel, and the integument reflected. In the superficial fascia of the calf, the terminal branches of the small sciatic nerve will be found. On removal of the subcutaneous fat the external and internal saphenous veins will be brought into view as far as the ankle. The external passes behind the outer malleolus, accompanied by the external saphenous nerve, whose double origin has been already noticed, and whose inner root lies at first beneath the fascia lata in the furrow of the gastrocnemius muscle. The internal or long saphe- noiis vein passes in front of the inner malleolus in company with the nerve of the same name, and the terminal branches of the internal cutaneous nerve

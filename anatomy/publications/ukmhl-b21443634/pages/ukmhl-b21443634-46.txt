32 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. anastomoses with the superior profunda, and, at the wrist, the superficial volar to the hand and a small anterior caoyal branch. Occupying the rest of tlie forearm is seen a group of five superficial flexor muscles descending from the internal condyle of the humerus. Of these the outermost is the pronator radii teres, previously brought partially into view; its insertion on the outer side of the radius, as well as the deep ulnar head of origin which separates the median nerve from the ulnar artery beneath it, can now be fully studied. Internal to this muscle are found in series from without inwards, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus (which, however, is often absent), the flexor suhlimis digitoriom, and the flexor carjn ulnaris. Of these the flexor sublimis is the largest, and it will be seen to have an additional origin from the radius, along by the lower border of the pronator teres : its four tendons where they pass beneath the anterior annular ligament at the wrist are disposed in pairs, those for the third and fourth fingers being in front of the other two. On raising this muscle for. its complete dissection, without dividing it, there may be obtained a complete view of the median nerve from the elbow to the wrist, giving branches to the superficial flexors, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and also in the upper part of the forearm the origin of its deejD branch the anterior interosseous, will be seen. The course of the tdnar artery will now also be completely exhibited ; giving off at the upper part the anterior and j)osterior ulnar rectcrrents, passing respectively in front of and behind the inner condyle of the humerus to anastomose

40 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB, four inner metacarpal bones on their palmar aspect may now be dissected and divided, and the interossei muscles may be studied ; namely, the three palmar interossei, arising each from the metacarpal bone of the finger to which it belongs, and inserted respec- tively into the ulnar side of the forefinger and the radial side of the ring and little fingers; and the four dorsal interossei, arising each from two metacarpal bones, the first of them, the ahductor indicts, being the muscle between whose heads of origin the radial artery passes forwards, while the two next are inserted one on each side of the middle finger, and the fourth is inserted on the ulnar side of the ring finger. 10. The Articulations.â€”Before proceeding to this dissection, a careful revisal should be made of all the parts which have been dissected and preserved ; the various muscles may be divided, and the student may exercise himself in recognising the cut portions by means of their attachments. The joints are then to be examined in series from above downwards. In the coraco-clavicular articulation the conoid and trapezoid ligaments are to be distinguished, and the bursa between them is to be noted, as also the positions in which the ligaments are respectively tightened. The acromio-clavicular articulation should then be dissected, and studied in connection with the coraco-clavicular ligaments. Two ligaments passing across difierent parts of the scapula next demand attention, viz. the suprascapular ligament above the notch for the nerve of the same name, and the coraco-acromial or deltoid ligament; and

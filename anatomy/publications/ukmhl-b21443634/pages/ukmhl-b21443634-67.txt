DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 53 sheath, one over the artery and another more inter- nally over the vein, these vessels will be seen to occupy separate compartments, while on the inside of the vein a third compartment short and blind will be found containing often a small lymphatic gland ; and it is this third compartment which is termed the crural canal, and which is distended by the descent of femoral hernia. Inserting the tip of the little finger into this canal, a firm resistance will be felt on the inner side, which is caused by the margin of Gimhernat's ligament. The integument may now be reflected from the rest of the thigh and from the surface of the knee- joint, and the subcutaneous fat should be removed in a direction from above downwards, so as to bring the cutaneous nerves into view without injuring them as they emerge from the fascia lata. A little below the anterior superior spine of the ilium the external cutaneous nerve will be found emerging in two parts, the anterior a couple of inches below the posterior, and supplying the outer side of the thigh. On the foz*e part of the thigh, about four inches or more below the groin, the middle cutaneotis branch of the anterior crural appears, usually divided into two parts, and descends to the front and inner side of the knee. The internal ' cutaneous nerve, also from the anterior crural, having previously given one or two offsets which accompany the internal saphenous vein, is likewise divided into two branches before it pierces the fascia lata ; the outer branch appears some inches above the knee, on the inner side of the thigh, while the inner is found lower down, 4

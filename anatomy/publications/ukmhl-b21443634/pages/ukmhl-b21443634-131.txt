DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Il7 upper rectus muscle and the levator palpebrte may always be easily found, as its branches enter the deep surface of the muscles; its lower division to the in- ferior and inner recti and inferior oblique is of con- siderable size. The sixth nerve is to be followed into the external rectus muscle. The inferior oblique muscle is best brought into view by dividing the con- junctiva below the eyeball, and seeking for the muscle at its origin at the inner part of the orbit, near its margin. There remain still for examination the lachrymal apparatus, the inner surface of the eyelids, and the tensor tarsi muscle. The carunculce, j^licco semilunaris, and puncta lachrymalia should be looked at in the living subject; and, after that, bristles may be passed into the puncta on the dead subject, and an effort made to follow the canaliculi. The levator palpebrse muscle is then to be divided, and the orbicularis pal- pebrarum and the eyelids should be raised from their connections above, below, and on the outside, and turned over towards the nose. By this means the tarsal conjunctiva, with the outlines of the Meibomian glands and subjacent tarsal cartilages visible through it, is brought into view, and the deep surface of the inner part of the orbicularis muscle can be dissected so as to display the fibres behind the tendo oculi and the extension over the lachrymal sac constituting the tensor tarsi. The lachrymal sac may be laid open and the entranije of the canaliculi into it exhibited ; and a probe may be passed down to test the direction and width of the nasal duct; or the catheterisation of the duct from the nose may be practised according

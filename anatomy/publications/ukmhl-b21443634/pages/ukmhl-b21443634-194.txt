180 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. furnishes, when present, a branch to the pectineus muscle. The psoas muscle is to be detached from its origins, so as to exhibit its separate origins from bodies and transverse processes of vertebrae, and lay bare the lumbar plexus from which the nerves already seen arise. The anterior divisions of the first and second lumbar nerves will be seen each to give off two branches of distribution and a communicating branch to the nerve below : while the third and fourth give off together two branches, and the fourth sends a communicating branch to the fifth lumbar. The ilio- hypogastric and ilio-inguinal are the branches from the first lumbar, the external cutaneous and genito- crural the two from the second, the anterior crural and obturator the branches from the third and fourth; and the cord formed by the fifth lumbar nerve joined by the communicating branch of the fourth, is called the lumbosacral cord, and enters the pelvis. Internal to the psoas muscle is the lumbar part of the sym- pathetic chain, resting on the bodies of the vertebrae ; and in the groove of each vertebral body long com- municating branches pass between each lumbar nerve and the corresponding sympathetic ganglion. There are usually two such branches connected with each nerve, but this is liable to variation. Turning now to the region of the quadratus lumborum muscle, the student will dissect the deep surface of the remains of the transversalis muscle, and will observe that it sends in a thin aponeurosis in front of the quadratus lumborum ; and on dividing this, and turning inwards the outer edge of the quadratus^

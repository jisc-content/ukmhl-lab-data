DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 39 carpi radialis brevior, extensor comraunis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris, and to the extensors of the thumb and index fingers, and terminates after passing on to the back of the wrist beneath the tendon of the extensor indicis, in a ganghform swelling from which articular branches are distributed to the joint. The posterior interosseous artery comes into view where it passes back between the oblique hgament and interosseous membrane; its branch, the interosseous recurrent, is to be followed up behind the external epicondyle of the humerus, and the main vessel is to be traced to its ramifications. Also, the termination of the anterior interosseous artery, after piercing the interosseous membrane, is to be seen on the back of the wrist. The radial artery is to be dissected out in the part of its course where it winds round beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb to reach the interval between the heads of origin of the abductor indicis, and pass for- wards to end in the deep palmar arch. The branches given off by the radial artery in this part of its course are also to be sought out; namely, its metacarpal branch supplying branches to the second interosseous space, and the smaller ^posterior carpal branch, and dorsal arteries of the thumb and index finger. The posterior carpal arch is formed by the anastomosis of the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries respectively, and from it the interosseous arteries of the third and fourth spaces spring ; an- other dorsal branch is supplied by the 2^osterior carpal of the ulnar. The transverse ligament binding the heads of the

sa 130 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. sected, and as the dissection cannot be made perfectly- complete on the eyeball of the subject, a pair of ox eyes may with advantage be used ; and the earliest oppor- tunity should be taken for a repetition on a perfectly fresh human eye. The eye of an infant is perfectly suit- able. If a weak solution of bichromate of potash be used, such as may be obtained by shaking a crystal for a moment in water till it gives it a straw colour, and an aperture be made in the sclerotic to admit the solution into the interior, the dissection will be facilitated, and the specimen may be preserved for any length of time without loss of transparency of the vitreous humour. The solution may be changed for spirit without further opacity taking place than serves to exhibit the hyaloid membrane ; but the outer layers of the lens are rendered opaque. In this way I have prepared specimens which have remained without deterioration for many years. A preliminary view may be obtained by making a transverse vertical section of one eye, which may be done by piercing through the sclerotic and other tunics half-way back, and dividing them'round about-svith the scissors. In the posterior part will be seen the sclerotic tinted on its deep surface with brown con- nective tissue, the memhrana fusca ; inside this, the choroid coat much more loaded with pigment in the ox than in the human subject; internally, the retina ; and between retina and choroid the ^jip-inenieo? hexa- gonal e2nthelium,,^ which, in a bichromate of potash > Without doubting the microscopic phenomena which led Max Schultze to count this epithelium as part of the retina, I still consider that it has a greater claim to be called the epithelium of t!ie choroid, and venture to think that there

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 93 A series of horizontal sections of the base of one hemisphei-e may now be made. In the region of the corpus striatum there will be noticed externally the grey surface of the island of Reil with a layer of white matter adjacent; passing inwards a long grey nucleus, the claustrum, is reached, and further inwards a band of white fibres, the external caj)sule ; the grey lenticular nucleus follows next, separated from the caudate or intra-ventricular nucleus by another band of white fibres, the internal capsule. Behind the nucleus caudatus lies the grey matter of the optic thalamus. Divide on each side the restiform body and the pons Yarolii where they are about to enter the cere- bellum, forming the inferior and middle crura. The fourth ventricle will thus be laid open ; the groove called calamus scrijJtorius will be seen on its floor, continued up from the opening of the central canal of the spinal cord. Fibres of the auditory nerve will be seen extending to the middle line, and lower down the delicate flap called the ligula ; also internal to the restiform bodies are the X)OSterior piyramids, whose fibres may be traced beneath the grey matter of the floor towards the cerebrum. The various lobes and laminae of the cerebellum may now be studied ; but it is only necessary here to mention the amygdala placed on each side of the vallecula, behind the floc- culus, and, in the vallecula, the inferior vermiform process, divided from behind forwards into parts named the pyramid, uvula, and nodule or laminated tubercle. If care be taken in removing the membranes it will be seen that the hollow of the fourth ventricle

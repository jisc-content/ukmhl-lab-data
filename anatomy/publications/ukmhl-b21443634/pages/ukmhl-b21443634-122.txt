108 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. ^ind back part, where a portion of the deep division of the muscle is left uncovered by the superficial. The zygomatic arch is to be divided with the bone-nippers, as far forwards and as far back as possible, namely, in front of and behind the origin of the masseter, and the masseter is to. be reflected downwards and separated from the greater part of the ramus of the jaw, so as to show the extent of its attachments. The surface of the temporal muscle is. then to be examined. The handle of the scalpel is to be passed in closely beneath the attachment of the temporal muscle to the coronoid process, so as to make sure of separating from its deep surface the buccal branch of nerve; and by means of two cuts with the bone-nippers, one directed downwards from the sig- moid notch, and the other backwards from the lower part of the anterior border of the ramus, the coro- noid process and fore part of the ramus are to be detached. The temporal muscle can then be reflected upwards, and what is known as the pterygoid space will be brought into view, and may be further exposed by clipping away all but the posterior border of the ramus of the jaw. On cleaning away the adipose tissue, the exter- nal 2yter'ygoid muscle will be found occupying the zygomatic fossa and directed back to the neck of the jaw ; and on its surface the internal maxillary o^vierj lies in its course from the parotid region where it has been seen arising, till where it dips between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle into the pterygo-maxillary fossa.' As it comes forward below ^ While this is the more common arrangement, it is to be

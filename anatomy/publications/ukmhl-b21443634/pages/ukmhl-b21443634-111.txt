DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 97 of the brachial plexus, and the subclavian artery. Arising from the front of the upper trunk the small nerve to the subclavius muscle is to be dissected out. The upper trunk of nerve will be seen to be formed by the union of the fifth and sixth, while the second consists of the seventh nerve ; the artery will be seen to curve over the apex of the pleural sac ; and in many instances the posterior scapular artery, usually reckoned as a division of the transverse cervical, will be noticed arising from it in the space. Behind the clavicle will be found the suprascapular artery and vein. 7. Anterior Triangula.â€”The surface of the sterno- cleido-mastoid muscle should now be completely cleaned, as well as the muscles in front of it, viz. the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; and at the same time care should be taken of the branches to these muscles from the loop formed by the hypoglossal nerve with communications from the cervical plexus, as also of the various layers of fascia in the middle line. One layer of fascia will be found extending between the sterno-mastoid muscles of opposite sides, and attached to the fur- cula of the sternum ; another between the sterno- hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles of opposite sides ; and a third still deeper, extending down into the thorax. These and the other structures met with near the middle line are to be studied in relation to the operation of tracheotomy. The other structures are the inferior thyroid veins, the ima thyroidea ar- tery (when it is present), the isthmus of the thyroid H

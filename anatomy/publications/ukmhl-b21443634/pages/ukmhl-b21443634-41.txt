DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 27 branches will also be found springing from the in- ternal cutaneous nerve near the axilla and ramifying on the inner side of the upper arm. The subcutaneous fat should then be removed with care in a direction from above downwards, so that the other cutaneous nerves may be detected and preserved as they escape from the aponeurosis of the limb : and we shall suppose this to be done as far as the wrist. On the inner side of the arm about the middle, the internal cutaneous nerve pierces the apo- neurosis, either as a single trunk or after division into its two branches, anterior and posterior. On the outer side, in the line of the external intermuscular septum, appear the two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve. In front, at the bend of the elbow, the mitsculo-cutaneous or external cuta- neous nerve appears by the outer side of the tendon of the biceps. At the back, over the olecranon, is a synovial bursa which sometimes becomes inflamed ; and on the inner side there is usually a small lym- phatic gland. In the forearm, on the outer side, in front, will be found the distribution of the anterior branch of the mitsculo-ciUaneous, and in the upper part the terminal twigs of the upper external cuta- neotts branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, while, be- hind, the posterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous extends as far as the wrist, reinforced by the in- ferior external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. On the inner side the internal cutaneoios will be fol- lowed to the wrist, its anterior branch in front, and its posterior branch on the dorsal aspect, the anterior branch sometimes joined by a small branch from the

86 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. of its outer surface will be found to be continuous behind with the parietal and occipital lobes, the suj}erior one passing into the sujyra-marginal, and the middle into the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe, while the inferior reaches back into the occipital lobe as the lowest of the annectant convolutions. The fissure of Rolando extends downwards and slightly forwards from the vertex to a spot a little behind tlie place where the fissure of Sylvius divides into its two limbs, and it may always be readily distinguished on account of its position between the first and second vertical convolutions on the outer surface of the hemisphere, counting from before backwards. The region in front of it, the frontal lobe of many authors, exhibits a vertical convolution, the ascending frontal,^ and three others which run in an antero-posterior direction and are named the siqJSTior, middle and inferior frontal convolutions. On the orbital or under surface of the frontal lobe these three convo- lutions are arranged round the tri-radiate sulcus in such a manner that the superior is contmuous with the inner, the inferior with the 2^osterior, and the middle with the anterior convolution. The parietal lobe lies behind the fissure of Rolando, and on the outer surface of the hemisphere is directly continuous with the occipital and the jDosterior part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobes, but on the inner surface of the hemisphere it is, as will be afterwards noticed, clearly demarcated from the occipital lobe by the parieto-occipital fissure. The upper end of this ' It is well to note that this convolution is named by Gratiolet the ' anterior ascending parietal.'

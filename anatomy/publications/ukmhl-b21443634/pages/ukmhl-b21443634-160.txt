146 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. this time removed the pelvis and lower lumbar vertebrae, in which case all the vertebrae which re- main can be examined by the thoracic dissectors ; but if that be not the division should be made about the level of the tenth dorsal vertebra; and in any circumstances, the first vertebra and costal arch should be left to the dissectors of the head and neck. In front of the vertebrae will then be seen part of the anterior common ligament and the stellate or anterior costo-vertebral ligaments. Behind, the laminae have probably been already removed, and the j^osterior common ligament will be seen behind the bodies of the vertebrae. The posterior costo-transverse liga- ments, passing from the tips of the transverse pro- cesses to the outer ridges of the tubercles of the ribs, require little dissection ; and the long costo-transverse ligaments will be seen on removal of the muscular fibres from the intervals between successive trans- verse processes. The movements permissible at the heads and tubercles of the ribs, as well as between the vertebrae, may then be examined, so far as the imperfect character of the specimen allows ; and the vertebrae may then be separated to show the liga- mentuvi colli costas between each rib and its corre- sponding transverse process, and also the interior of the costo-vertebral joint, with its interarticular ligament. To exhibit fully, however, the movements of the vertebrae and ribs requires a thorax and ver- tebral column to be devoted to the purpose ; and even then it is to be remembered that the respi- ratory movements cannot be imitated after death.

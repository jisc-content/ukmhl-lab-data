If the subject be a male, at least one day should be devoted to the dis- section of the perinseum before the other dissections are commenced, as the surgical anatomy of that region cannot be well appreciated after dissection of the lower limbs, nor in other than the lithotomy position. After the dissection of the perinseum in the case of a male, or immediately on being brought into the rooms in the case of a female, the subject should be laid on its face, for the dissection of the liinder part of the scalp and neck, the muscles and other structures of the back, the spinal cord, the buttock, the back of the thigh, and the popliteal space.

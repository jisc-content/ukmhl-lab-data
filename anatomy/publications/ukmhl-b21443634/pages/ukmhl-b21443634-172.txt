158 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. from the rest of the internal oblique muscle. Passing the handle of the scalpel between the divided, edge of the internal oblique and the still uninjured trans- versalis muscle, the student will now proceed to investigate the relations of the lower parts of these two muscles, one to the other. He will find them usually not very distinctly separated below ; but the superficial branch of the deej} circumflex iliac artery, directed upwards and outwards between them, will serve for a guide ; and he will divide the fibres of the internal oblique close to Poupart's ligament, and turn them inwards. He will then find that the fibres strictly belonging to the transversalis muscle cease at a somewhat higher level than those of the internal oblique, and that the lower fibres of both muscles are continued into an aponeurotic expansion, the conjoined tendon, which is directed downwards to the pubes. This will be seen to more advantage on dividing and reflecting inwards the lower part of the transversalis muscle in the same way as the in- ternal oblique was divided. Also, the upper fibres of the cremaster muscle may be raised from their position ; and if the handle of the scalpel be intro- duced between them and the spermatic cord, the dis- sector will see the thin expansion of fascia connected with its fibres, named the cremasteric fascia. There is now brought into view a continuous sheet of thin fascia, fascia transversalis, lying beneath the transversalis muscle, attached to Poupart's liga- ment, and stronger in the neighbourhood of that structure than in the upper and inner part of the dis- section. The part of the spermatic cord laid bare by

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 153 upwards on the abdomen, but not down into the thi ghs. At the lower and inner part of the portion of the aponeurosis of the external- oblique muscle brought into view there is a separation in its fibres, the external or, more properly, superficial abdominal ring ; and, emerging from this opening in the male is the siJermatic cord, consisting of structures descending to the testicle ; while in the female the same position is occupied by the round ligarnent of the uterus, a structure passing down to be attached in the labium, and, except when the uterus is much enlarged, greatly smaller than the spermatic cord in the male. A little above the superficial abdominal ring, the ter- minal branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve pierces the aponeurosis, while through the ring comes the ilio- inguinal nerve to terminate in the pubic integu- ments. The integument may now be reflected from the rest of the abdominal wall; and the subcutaneous fat is then to be removed from the structures under- neath, so as at once to clear the aponeurotic anterior Avail of the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle, separated from that of the opposite side by the linea alba in the middle line ; and in removing the fat a series of four or more anterior cutaneous branches of the loioer intercostal nerves with corresponding inter- costal vessels in company, are to be preserved and followed out from their emergence through the sheath of the rectus muscle ; while the terminal branches of these nerves pierce the sheath of the rectus close to its inner margin, they frequently give ofi" cutaneous twigs which pierce the outer margin of the muscle.

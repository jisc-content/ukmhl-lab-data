DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 23 the ulnar, and the inner head of the median nerve; the posterior cord (behind the vessels) giving off the three subscapular, the circumflex, and the mus- culo-spiral. The long sitbscapular nerve has already- been dissected out, the second is now seen passing to the subscapular muscle and the teres major, while the short subscapular, situated deeper in the axilla, ends altogether in the subscapular muscle, and will be better seen after removal of the limb. On the fourth day after the turning of the sub- ject, the sterno-clavicular articulation can be studied by dissecting out the inter-clavicular and costo-clavi- cular ligaments, and dividing the anterior ligament sufficiently to expose the interior of the joint and the inter-articular Jihro-cartilage, then moving the limb about so as to exhibit the relations of the articular surfaces one to another in different positions of the limb and the tension or relaxation of the various ligamentous structures in those positions, while the posterior ligament, which is closely connected with the costo-coracoid, remains untouched. The clavicle may then be sawn across, or, in the event of the dissection of the neck being sufficiently advanced, and it being deemed advisable, it may be disarticu- lated from the sternum. The continuity of all vessels and nerves passing from the neck to the limb, in- cluding the siqjra-scapular artery and nerve, is now to be studied in conjunction, if possible, with the dissector of the neck, and they are then to be divided, and the serratus magnus is to be brought more fully into view by pulling the limb outwards from the body. The three parts of this muscle,

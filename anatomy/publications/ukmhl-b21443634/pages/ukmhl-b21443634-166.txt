152 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. sternum to the pubes ; and another incision, if not already made by the dissector of the arm, is to be carried transversely outwards from the upper end of this, as far as the border of the latissimus dorsi; while, if the skin is intact at the fold of the groin, a third may be directed inwards from the upper iliac spine. The integument is then to be removed from the lower or inguinal portion of the abdominal wall, situated below the last incision, and it is preferable that arrangement be made with the dissector of the lower limb to raise in one flap continuous with it the integument of the upper part of the thigh and so avoid an incision along the fold of the groin. In the subcutaneous tissue underneath will be found two sets of branches of the femoral artery and vein, viz. the superficial circumflex iliac vessels directed up- wards and outwards, and the superficial ejyigastric directed upwards and inwards. These vessels course superficial to a deeper and more membranous layer of the superficial fascia, sometimes distinguished as Scarp)a's fascia ; and this may be conveniently brought into view by cutting down on the subjacent aponeu- rosis of the external oblique muscle at the level of the transverse cutaneous incision, and raising the fascia from the aponeurosis with the handle of the scalpel, then dividing it in the middle line and con- tinuing the separation, when it will be seen to be firmly bound down a little below the level of Poupart's ligar)ient, while towards the middle line the space beneath it is continued into the labium in the female, and the scrotum in the male ; a circumstance of im- portance, explaining why urinary infiltrations pass

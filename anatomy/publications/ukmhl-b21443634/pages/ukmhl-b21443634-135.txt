DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 121 little nicety, the deep part of the Glasserian fissure can also be opened, so as to expose in its continuity the chorda tympani, and show the attachment of the processus gracilis of the malleus. The action of the tensor tymj^ani mviscle can now be studied, and the arrangement of the mctUeus, incus, and staj^es ; also the tendon of the staioedius muscle will be seen pass- ing forwards through the perforation of the pyramid to the neck of the stapes. The continuity of the middle ear with the Eustachian tube in front and the mastoid cells behind should also be noted, and the mastoid process should be opened in order fully to exhibit the latter. When the tympanum has been studied, the general arrangement of the labyrinth should be examined. A full view of this part can only be obtained in speci- mens specially prepared ; but with a few judicious applications of the bone-nippers, beginning by lay- ing open the internal auditory meatus from above and extending the unroofing process forwards and backwards, the cocJilea may be seen to lie with its base at the forepart of the cribriform plate, its cavity coiled in two circles and a half round the modiolus or central pillar from which the lamina sjoiralis pro- jects into it; and the cavity of the vestibule will be opened into, opposite the hinder part of the cribriform plate, while the semicircular canals can be seen in section, the superior canal crossing the axis of the pars petrosa vertically, the posterior lying close to its posterior surface, and the external placed horizon- tally. In making this dissection the first care should be to follow the x>ortio dura of the seventh nerve to

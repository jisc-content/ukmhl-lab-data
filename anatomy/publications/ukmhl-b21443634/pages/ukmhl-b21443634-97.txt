DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 83 terior sjdnal, the anterior spinal, and the posterior inferior cerebellar ; the basilar artery formed by the union of the two vertebrals, lying on the pons Varolii and giving off the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the sit/^eHor cerebellar arteries and small transverse arteries, and the acoustic artery to supply the internal ear ; and the 2:)osterior cerebral arteries, the two vessels into which the basilar divides. At the origin of these arises a mesial bunch of minute vessels which dip into the brain at the 2^osterior perforated spot at the back of the rhomboid space ; and further out the posterior comrmmicating artery on each side joins the posterior cerebral. Further forwards are the divided internal carotid arteries, giving off the posterior com- municating, and dividing into anterior and middle cerebral. At its commencement the middle cerebral artery gives off the clioroid artery, which is a vessel entering by the fissure between the crus cerebri and middle lobe of the brain to supply the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle ; also a brush of small vessels dipping directly into the brain, and by their apertures of entrance forming the anterior perforated spot. Joining the anterior cerebral artery with its fellow is the exceedingly short anterior communicating artery, which closes in front the circle of anastomosis com- pleted behind by the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries, and known as the Circle of Willis. The surface of the brain is now to be more fully exposed by the removal of the arachnoid and pia mater, care being taken not to injure the origins of the nerves; and the arteries also are to be taken G 2

80 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. is not intended to use preserving agents, examination of the upper and interior parts of the brain in situ, before removal of the basal parts, is to be preferred to immediate removal, as it allows the interior to be seen without accidental laceration or disturbance, and when the anterior parts have been first disposed of, the base can be spread out advantageously for display. The method of removal varies according to the position of the subject. If the subject be on its /ace, the posterior lobes of the hemispheres should be raised ; the edge of the knife should be applied to the free margin of the tentorium close to the border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and by a firm cut the fourth and Jifth nerves may be divided along with the tentorium without being previously brought into view. The knife is then to be carried along the outer attachment of the tentorium to within an inch of the middle line ; at the middle of the free edge the veins of Galen, emerging from the interior of the brain, are to be divided, and tentorium and falx may then be thrown back, the lobes of the cerebellum raised, the spinal cord and vertebral arteries in front of it divided as low down in the spinal canal as pos- sible, and the nerves divided in series from below upwards, close to the places where they pierce the dura mater. After dividing the third pair, the infun- dibulum will be seen descending to the pituitary body in the sella turcica, and on division of it, on each side further forward will be found the internal carotid artery with the optic nerve immediately in front of it;

120 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. along the Eustachian tube, and the other downwards to the tensor or circumjlexus 2)alati, which muscle is seen arising in part from the downward-curving outer border of the cartilage of the tube. On one side, however, it is well to refrain from this dissection, in order that at a later period the ganglion may be seen from the deep aspect. Proceeding now to the dissection of the ear, the pinna may be first dissected by removal of the integu- ment, so as to show the cartilage and muscles. On the foremost part of the helix is its greater muscle, and below this, at its extremity, dipping into the concha, is its smaller muscle. On the outside of the tragus and antitragus are the two muscles which take name from those eminences; while on the back of the pinna are two small muscles, one, the transverse, stretching across the groove corresponding to the antihelix, and the other, the oblique, across the groove corresponding to the lower of the two parts into which the antihelix divides above. The pointed in- ferior extremity of the helix, the absence of cartilage from the lobule, and the manner in which the car- tilage is folded round so as to form the outer part of the external auditory canal, also the Jisstores of Santo- rini, are all to be exhibited. The wall of the cranium being now sawn down to the level of the petrous part of the temporal bone, the osseous part of the auditory canal is to be laid open with the nippers, care being taken not to injure the membrana ti/mj^ani ; the course of the tensor tympani muscle is also to be followed backwards, and the tympanic cavity gently unroofed.

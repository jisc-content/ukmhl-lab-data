DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 105 the orbit and crossed by the facial artery is the levator propo-ius labii sup)erioris, with the outer border of which the zygomaticus minor is usually connected. More internally, descending on the side of the nose, is the levator communis lahii sttperioris alaique nasi j and on the ridge of the nose is the terminal twig of the nasal branch of the fifth nerve, emerging between the bone and cartilage ; while lower down is the very small depressor alee nasi, arising from the incisor fossa and inserted into the septum and back part of the ala of the nose. The course of the main trunks of the facial artery and vein is to be traced from their appearance on the face in front of the masseter muscle to their termination in the angular artery and vein internal to the orbit ; and the lateral nasal branch of the artery will also be seen. Two deeper muscles and a nerve are now to be displayed, to a certain extent under cover of the levator proprius labii superioris. The nerve, the infraorbital, emerges from the canal of the same name ; it is the terminal part of the second division of the fifth nerve, and sends large branches to the upper lip. The muscles rise from the canine fossa, and are the levator anguli oris directed downwards and outwards, and the com- p>ressor naris widening as it extends inwards on the nose. The buccinator, the flat muscle which supports the mucous membrane of the mouth between the upper and lower jaws, is now to be cleaned so far as it is yet laid bare ; and the pad of fat between its back part and the masseter muscle is to be taken away ; and on the surface of the buccinator there should be found the buccal branch of the internal

128 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. take to reach the nasal duct and the Eustachian tube. The inferior turbinated bone should then be in part removed to exhibit the character of the orifice of the nasal duct. If the parts be in good condition an additional dissection of the otic ganglion from the deep aspect may now be made. The pterygo-maxillary fossa should then be opened into by removal of the ascend- ing plate of the palate-bone piecemeal with the aid of bone-nippers and scissors; and the descending branches of Meckel's ganglion should be followed to their distribution in the palate. The large palatine branch will be found descending with the superior or descending i^alatine artery, a branch of the internal maxillary artery ; while the small ov 20osterior p)alatine nerve and the external palatine occupy the small canals of the same names. A dissection may now be made, as before directed, of the remaining ear. 16. Vertebral Muscles and Articulations.â€”It remains for the dissector to examine the muscles attached to the vertebrae. The scaleni muscles still remain uninjured : the anterior has been already seen ; and, of the fibres behind the position of the subclavian artery, those attached to the first rib constitute the middle, and those proceeding to the second the posterior scalenus. Nearer the middle line, in front of the vertebrae, is the rectics capitis anticics major ascending to the skull ; and under cover of it the rectus capitis anticus minor ; while between the recti and scaleni and the middle line is the longus colli muscle. Ascending from the transverse process of the atlas is the rectus capitis lateralis.

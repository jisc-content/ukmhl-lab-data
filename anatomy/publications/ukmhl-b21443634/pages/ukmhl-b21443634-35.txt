DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPEE LIMB. 21 walls of the axilLa. In this way will be brought into view the lateral cutaneous branches of the upper in- tercostal nerves as they pierce the thoracic wall ; and these are to be followed out, especially the highest of the series, the intercosto-humeral nerve, which is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal, and crosses the axilla, piercing its fascia, to be dis- tributed on the inner and back part of the arm. The lateral cutaneous offsets of the succeeding intercostal nerves after piercing the serratus magnus divide each into an anterior and a posterior branch. The lym- phatic glands of the axilla, receiving lymphatics from the arm, the back, the mamma and the walls of the chest, should now be cleared from the tissue in which they are imbedded, and the remaining adipose tissue and fascia within reach should be removed. The long thoracic artery will be seen towards the front of the space, and the subscapular artery at the back (sometimes sending a branch forwards on the thoracic wall) ; while, in the deep part of the middle of the space, distributed to the glands, is the alar thoracic. The long subscapular nerve lying close to the sub- scapular artery passes down to supply the latissimus dorsi ; and the so-called posterior thoracic nerve or external respiratory nerve of Bell (from the fifth and sixth cervical trunks) descends from the neck, behind the great vessels and nerves, on the surface of the serratus magnus, to which it is distributed. These structures being exhibited and preserved, let the axillary vessels and brachial plexus of nerves where they emerge from the axilla be brought thoroughly into view; and also the origins of the anterior and

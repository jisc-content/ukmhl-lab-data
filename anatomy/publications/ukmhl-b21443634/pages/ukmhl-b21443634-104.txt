90 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. and outwards from the point where the back of the corpus callosum passes into the hemisphere, and is to be carried through the posterior crus of the fornix, without injury to the underlying reflexion of pia mater. The back part of the corpus callosum can then be lifted up, and the fornix attached to it can be reflected forwards, so as to exhibit the appearance on its under surface named psalterium or lyra, caused by transverse fibres properly belonging to the corpus callosum being bounded on each side by a longitudinal half of the fornix : also the dipping do-wii of the ante- rior crura of the fornix will be seen. The reflection of pia mater, called velum interiJositum, of which the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are the vas- cular edges, is now exposed, with the vems of Galen running down the middle ; and, on the side on which the descending cornu has been dissected, the posterior lobe of the hemisphere may be lifted up and the transverse fissure of the brain, by which the velum interpositum and choroid plexus enter from without, may be laid open to the bottom of the cornu. By this means the posterior part of the gyrus fornicatus will be disjjlayed, with the sulcus hi2>pocav%2n between it and the tsenia hippocampi, and the so-called fascia dentata at the bottom of the sulcus. The choroid plexus is to be divided on each side at the entrance into the descending cornu ; the pia mater behind the velum interpositum is to be raised from the corpora quadrigemina, which it covers, and as it is reflected forwards, care is to be taken to separate from it, without injury, a body about the size of a small pea, the pineal body, which is attached

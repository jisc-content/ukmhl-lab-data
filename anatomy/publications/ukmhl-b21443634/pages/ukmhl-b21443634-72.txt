58 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB, given off either by the posterior division of the in- ternal circumflex or by the obturator artery. The examination of the adductor magnus muscle may now be completed, and the muscle may be di- vided : also the examination of the quadriceps ex- tensor cruris may be completed by first dividing the rectus femoris ; secondly, making an incision through the whole length of the vastus internus about an inch from the origin of its superficial fibres, so as to show the interval of bare bone between the origin ci this muscle and the crureus; and thirdly, making another incision vertically through the crureus to display not only the inferior limit of its origin, but also the few fibres underneath it attached to the ascending part of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, and termed suhcrureus. The obturator externus and psoas and iliacus muscles may now be divided, and between the com- mon tendon of the last two muscles and the capsule of the joint a large synovial bursa is to be noted. The capsule of the hip-joint is now to be dissected ; its deficiency at the back part can be easily brought into view by flexing and abducting the femur, and its strength in front is to be noted, where it has added to it the accessory, ilio-femoral or Y-shaped ligament descending from the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, its inner fibres directly downwards, and its outer fibres, as far outwards as the base of the great trochanter ; and it will be seen that it is in connec- tion with this most important ligament that the an- terior intertrochanteric line is so rough.

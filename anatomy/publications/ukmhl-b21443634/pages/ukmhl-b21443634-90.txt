76 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the levator anguli scapulae be dissected out and drawn aside, a view will be obtained of the scalenus medius and scalenus posticus muscles descending to the first and second ribs respectively. Piercing the middle scalene muscle the nerve to the rhomboids, and below it the external respiratory nerve of Bell, both from the brachial plexus, will be observed, and at the anterior border of the levator scapulae, in normal circumstances, the dissector may expose the termination of the transverse cervical artery from the thyroid axis of the subclavian breaking up into superficial cervical and posterior scapular branches. The complexus muscle is to be detached from the occipital bone and reflected, and the deep cervical artery, anastomosing with the cervical branch of the occipital, is to be dissected. Upon the deep surface of the complexus there will be found the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the second, third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. These pass from the neighbourhood of the intervertebral foramina inwards beneath the complexus muscle, and their cutaneous branches, already noticed, reach the surface near the middle line. The first three are occasionally joined to one another as they lie beneath the muscles. It will now be observed that the muscles laid bare fall into two groups, one above and the other below the spine of the axis. Those below the axis, consisting of the semispinalis and muscles covered by it, are to be left to the dissectors of the upper limbs, while those above the axis may be dissected forthwith. Passing obliquely upwards and outwards from the spine of the axis to the transverse

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 57 internal saphenous branch, is entirely muscular, supply- ing the different parts of the quadriceps extensor f emo- ris. The branch to the vastus internus also gives off an articular branch to the knee which descends on the internal intermuscular septum with a branch of the anastomotica magna. The accessory obturator nerve, when present, passes over the brim of the pelvis, internal to the great vessels, to aid in the supply of the pectineus muscle, which otherwise re- ceives a twig from the obturator nerve. The pectineus and adductor longus are next to be divided and dissected well up to their attachments. The adductor brevis will thus be brought into view with the anterior division of the obturator nerve upon its surfaces, and the course of the profunda femoris artery, and the origins of its four perforating branches may be studied. When these have been examined, let the adductor brevis be divided, and now the posterior division of the obturator nerve will be seen, and the branches of the obturator nerve to all the adductor muscles can be made out. The internal circumflex artery is to be followed, and will be seen dividing into two branches, an ascending or anterior branch distributed in the adductors brevis and gracilis and the obturator externus muscle, and anastomosing with the obturator artery, and a transverse or p)os- terior branch which has already been seen from be- hind. The obturator externus muscle is also to be cleaned, its relation to the hip-joint noted, and the distribution of the obturator artery outside the pelvis examined. A small branch to the hip-joint will be seen to enter the joint at the notch of the acetabulum.

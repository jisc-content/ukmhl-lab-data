DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 50 accompanied by the continuation of the nerve, it is naturally crossed by the nerve in the lower part of the space. The origins of the five articular bi'anches of the popliteal artery will also be seen at this time, namely, an outer and inner superior articular branch-, an outer and inner inferior articular, and an azygos branch coming off directly or from the upper and outer branch. The articular twigs of nerve already alluded to correspond with the arteries ; and before the popliteal trunk is cleaned the small branch of the obturator nerve to the knee-joint, if not previously exhibited, should be seen piercing the adductor magnus and descending on the artery to reach the back of the joint. The integument and fascia lata separating the popliteal from the gluteal dissection are to be divided. The great and small sciatic nerves can then be traced backwards to the gluteal dissection. The muscular branches of the former nerve to the biceps, semi-ten- dinosus, and semi-membranosus muscles may be at the same time followed, as also another to assist the supply of the adductor magnus. The three ham- string muscles are to be fully dissected out, including the short head of the biceps; and the shortness of the fibres of the semi-membranosus and the tendi- nous intersection of the semi-tendinosus ai"e to be noted. Also the posterior surface of the adductor magnus muscle should be thoroughly exhibited, and the various arteries which perforate it should be at- tended to, namely, the four perforating branches of the profunda femoris, and the popliteal. 3.

THE SKELETON 2l6 fibres of this muscle. To the inferior lip, throughout its whole length, is attached the Deltoid. The interval between the lips is also partly covered by the fibres of these muscles. The external border, or hase, the shortest of the three, is slightly concave, its edge thick and round, continuous above with the under surface of the acromion process, below with the neck of the scapula. The narrow portion of bone Fig. 195.-â€”Left scapula. Posterior surface, or dorsum. external to this border, and separating it from the glenoid cavity, is called the great scapular notch, and serves to connect the supra- and infra-spinous fossae. The Acromion Process, so called from forming the summit of the shoulder {aKpov, a summit; oj/xos, the shoulder), is a large and somewhat triangular process, flattened from behind forwards, directed at first a little outwards, and then curving forwards and upwards, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, is convex, rough, and gives attachment to some fibres of the Deltoid, and in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous. Its

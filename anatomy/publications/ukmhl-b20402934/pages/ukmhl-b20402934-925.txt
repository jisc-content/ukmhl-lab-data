875 THE CHEEKS AND GUMS membrane, the frcBnwn lahii superioris and inferioris—the former being the larger of the two. The labial glands are situated between the mucous membrane and the Orbicu- laris oris, round the orifice of the mouth. They are rounded in form, about the size of small peas, their ducts opening by small orifices upon the mucous membrane. In structure they resemble the salivary glands. The cheeks form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed externally of integument; internally of mucous membrane; and between the two of a muscular stratum, besides a large quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheek is reflected above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Fig. 509.—Sectional view of the nose, mouth, pharynx, etc. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of which presents the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The principal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator ; but numerous other muscles enter into its formation; viz. the Zygomatici, Risorius Santorini, and Platysma myoides. The buccal glands are placed between the mucous membrane and Buccinator muscle : they are similar in structure to the labial glands, but smaller. \ < Two or three of larger size than the rest are placed between the Masseter and Buccinator muscles ; their ducts open into the mouth opposite the last molar tooth. They are called molar glands. The gums are composed of a dense fibrous tissue, closely connected to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and surrounding the necks of the teeth. They are covered by smooth and vascular mucous membrane, which is remarkable for

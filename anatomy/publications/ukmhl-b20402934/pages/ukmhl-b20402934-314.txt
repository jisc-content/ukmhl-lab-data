The external surface is narrower than the internal; its upper two-thirds presents a shal- low groove for the attachment of the Tibialis anticus muscle; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually forwards to the anterior part of the bone, and is covered from within outwards by the tendons of the follow- ing muscles : Tibialis anticus. Extensor proprius hallucis, Ex- tensor longus digitorum. The posterior surface (fig. 221) presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the oblique line of the tibia, which extends from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula obliquely downwards, to the internal border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. It marks the limit for the in- sertion of the Popliteus muscle, and serves for the attachment of the popliteal fascia and part of the Soleus, Flexor longus digitorum, and Tibialis posticus muscles ; the triangular concave surface, above and to the inner side of this line, gives attachment to the Popliteus muscle. The middle third of the posterior surface is divided by a vertical ridge into two lateral halves : the ridge is well marked at its commencement at the oblique line, but becomes gradually indistinct below; the inner and broader half gives attachment to the Flexor longus digitorum, the outer and narrower to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of the bone presents a smooth surface covered by the Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longus hallucis muscles. Immediately below the oblique line is the medullary foramen, which is directed obliquely dowuAvards. The Lower Extremity, much

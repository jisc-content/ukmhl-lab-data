THE THOEAX sternum by the remains of the thymus gland above, and a little loose areolar tissue below ; and is covered by the margins of the lungs, especially the left. Behind, it rests upon the bronchi, the oesophagus, and the descending aorta. Laterally, it is covered by the pleurae ; the phrenic nerve, with its accompanying vessels, descending between the two membranes on either side. Structure of the Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane, and consists, therefore, of two layers, an external fibrous and an internal serous. Fig. 560.—Pericardium, from in front. The sac has been distended with plaster. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) The fibrous layer is a strong, dense membrane. Above, it surrounds the great vessels arising from the base of the heart, on which it is continued in the form of tubular prolongations, which are gradually lost upon their external coat; the strongest being that which encloses the aorta. The pericardium may be traced, over these vessels, to become continuous with the deep layer of the cervical fascia. On each side of the ascending aorta it sends upwards a diverticulum ; the one on the left side, somewhat conical in shape, passes upwards and outwards, between the arch of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, as far as the ductus arteriosus, where it terminates in a caecal extremity which is attached by loose connective tissue to the obhterated duct (fig. 560). The one on the right side passes upwards and to the right, between the ascending aorta and vena cava superior, and also terminates

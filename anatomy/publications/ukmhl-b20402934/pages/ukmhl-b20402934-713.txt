665 OF THE NECK glands. The cerebral lymphatics are described by Eshmann as being situated between the arachnoid and pia mater, as well as in the choroid i^lexuses of the lateral ventricles; they accompany the trunks of the carotid and vertebral arteries, and probably pass through foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. They have not at present been demonstrated in the dura mater, or in the substance of the brain. The Lymphatic Glands of the Neck are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial cervical glands may be arranged in three sets:—(i) The Fig. 396.—The deep lymphatics and glands of the neck and thorax. suhfnaxillary, ten to fifteen in number, situated beneath the body of the lower jawin'^the submaxillary triangle ; (2) suprahyoid, situated in the middle line of the neck, between the anterior bellies of the two digastric muscles ; and (3) cervical, placed in the course of the external jugular vein between the Platysma and deep fascia. They are most numerous at the root of the neck, in the triangular interval between the clavicle, the Sterno-mastoid, and the Trapezius, where they are continuous with the axillary glands. A few small glands are also found on the front and sides of the larynx. The deep cervical glands (fig. 396) are numerous and of large size ; they form a chain along the sheath of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, lying by

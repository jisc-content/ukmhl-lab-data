OPHTHALMIC 549 The Ophthalmic Artery arises from the mternal carotid, just as that vessel is emerging from the cavernous sinus, on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen, below and on the outer side of the optic nerve. It then passes over the nerve, to the inner wall of the orbit, and thence horizontally forwards, beneath the lower border of the Superior oblique muscle to a point behind the internal angular process of the frontal bone, where it divides into two terminal branches, the frontal and nasal. Branches.—The branches of this vessel may be divided into an orbital groiijp, Fig. 353.—The ophthahnic artery and its branches, the roof of the orbit having been removed.

Arteria Centralis Retinae. The lachrymal is the first, and one of the largest branches derived from the ophthalmic, arising close to the optic foramen : not unfrequently it is given oft* from the artery before it enters the orbit. It accompanies the lachrynlal nerve along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. Its terminal branches, escaping from the gland, are distributed to the eyelids and conjunctiva, anastomosing with the palpebral arteries. The lachrymal artery gives off one or two malar branches ; one of which passes through a foramen in the malar bone, to reach the temporal fossa, and anastomoses with

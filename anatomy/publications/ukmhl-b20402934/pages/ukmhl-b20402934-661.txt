613 FEMOKAL vtum For convenience of description and also in reference to its surgical anatomy, the femoral atftery is divided into a short trunk, about an inch and a half or two inches long, which is known as the common femoral artery, and the remainder of the vessel, which is known as the sujjerficial femoral, to distinguish it from the deep femoral (profunda femoris), which is a large branch given off from the common femoral at its termination, and which by 376.â€”Surgical anatomy of the femoral artery, its derivation from the parent trunk marks the commencement of the superficial femoral artery. The common femoral artery is very superficial, being covered by the skin and superficial fascia, superficial inguinal lym- phatic glands, the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and the prolongation down- wards of the Transversalis fascia, which forms the sheath of the vessels. It has in front of it filaments from the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, the superficial circumflex iliac vein, and occasionally the superficial epigastric vein. It rests on the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, which separates it from the cap- sular ligament of the hip- joint, and a little lower on the Pectineus muscle ; and crossing behind it is the branch to the Pectineus from the anterior crural nerve. Separating the artery from the Psoas and Pectineus muscles is the pubic portion of the fascia lata and the prolongation from the fascia covering the Iliacus muscle which forms the posterior layer of the sheath of the vessels. The anterior crural nerve lies about half an inch to the outer side of the com- mon femoral artery, lying between the Psoas and Iliacus muscles. To the inner side of the artery is the femoral vein, between the margins of the Pectineus and Psoas muscles. The two vessels are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath, formed by the proper sheath of the vessels, strengthened by the fascia lata (see page 486) ; the artery and vein are separated, however, from one another by a thm fibrous partition.

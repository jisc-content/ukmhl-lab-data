THE THORAX 954 The internal surface of the right auricle is smooth, except in the appendix and adjacent part of the anterior wall of the sinus venosus, where it is thrown into parallel ridges. It presents the following parts for examination :— Superior cava. Inferior cava. Openings -l Coronary sinus. Valves Foramina Thebesii. ^Auriculo-ventricular.

The inferior vena cava, larger than the superior, returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens into the lowest part of the auricle, near the septum, the direction of its orifice being upwards and inwards. The direction of a current of blood through the superior vena cava would consequently be towards the auriculo-ventricular orifice ; whilst the direction of the blood through the mferior cava would be towards the auricular septum. This is the normal direction of the two currents in foetal life. The tuberculum Loweri is a small projection on the right wall of the auricle, between the two venas cavae. It is most distinct in the hearts of quadrupeds ; in man it is scarcely visible. It was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. The coronary sinus opens into the auricle, between the inferior vena cava and

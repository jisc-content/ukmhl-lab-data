203 THE STEENUM being the larger; * the second piece has seldom more than one ; the third, fom'th, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centres placed laterally, the irregular union of which will serve to explain the occasional occurrence of the sternal foramen (fig. 184), or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects this part of the bone, and which is further explained by the manner in which the cartilaginous matrix, in which ossifica- tion takes place, is formed (see page 85). Union of the various centres of the gladiolus commences about puberty, from below, and proceeds upwards, so that by the age of twenty-five they are all united, and this portion of bone consists of one piece (fig. 182). The ensiform cartilage becomes joined to the gladiolus about forty. The manu- brium is occasionally, but not invariably, joined to the gladiolus in advanced life by bone. When this union takes place, how- ever, it is generally only superficial, a portion of the centre of the sutural cartil- age remaining unossified.

Attachment of Muscles. ■—To nine pairs and one single muscle : the Pector- ahs major, Sterno-cleido- mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Triangu- laris sterni, aponeuroses of the Obliquus externus, Ob- liquus internus, Transver- salis, Rectus muscles, and Diaphragm. * Sir George Humphry states that this is ' probably the more complete condition.'

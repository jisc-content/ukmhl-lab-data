745 FIFTH. SUPEEIOE MAXILLARY DIVISION it pierces the temporal fascia, it gives off a slender twig, which runs between the two layers of the fascia to the outer angle of the orbit. The malar branch passes along the external inferior angle of the orbit, emerges upon the face through a foramen in the malar bone, and, perforating the Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, supplies the skin on the prominence of the cheek, and is named suhcutaneus malcB. It joins with the facial and the palpebral branches of the superior maxillary. The spheno-palatine branches, two in number, descend to the spheno-palatine ganglion. The posterior superior dental branches arise from the trunk of the nerve just as it is about to enter the infra-orbital canal ; they are generally two in number. Fig. 444.â€”Distribution of the second and third divisions of the fifth nerve and submaxillary ganglion. but sometimes arise by a single trunk and immediately divide and pass downwards on the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone. They give off several twigs to the gums and neighbouring parts of the mucous membrane of the cheek {superior gingival branches). They then enter the posterior dental canals on the zygomatic surface of the superior maxillary bone, and, passing from behind forwards in the substance of the bone, communicate with the middle dental nerve, and give off branches to the lining membrane of the antrum and three twigs to each of the molar teeth. These twigs enter the foramina at the apices of the fangs, and supply the pulp. The middle superior dental branch is given off from the superior maxillary nerve in the back part of the infra-orbital canal, and runs downwards and forwards in a special canal in the outer wall of the antrum to supply the two

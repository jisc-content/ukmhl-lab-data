io6o SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA superficial and a little external to the femoral artery. It pierces the anterior layer of the sheath of the vessels, and, becoming superficial by passing through the fascia lata, it supplies the skin of the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the pelvis and knee. On the front of the thigh it communicates with the outer branch of the middle cutaneous nerve, derived from the anterior crural. The dee;p layer of the superficial.fascia is a very thin fibrous layer, best marked on the inner side of the long saphenous vein and below Poupart's ligament. It is placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the fascia lata, to which it is intimately adherent at the lower margin of Poupart's ligament. It covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels corre- FiG. 627.â€”Femoral hernia, showing fascia lata and saphenous opening. sponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, and by numerous blood and lymphatic vessels ; hence it has been termed the cribriform fascia, the openings for these vessels having been likened to the holes in a sieve. The cribriform fascia adheres closely both to the superficial fascia and to the fascia lata, so that it is described by some anatomists as a part of the fascia lata, but it is usually considered (as in this work) as belonging to the superficial fascia. It is not till the cribriform fascia has been cleared away that the saphenous opening is seen, so that this opening does not in ordinary cases exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. A femoral hernia, in passing through the saphenous opening, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. The deep layer of superficial fascia, together with the cribriform fascia, having been removed, the fascia lata is exposed.

952 THE THOEAX The vestigial fold of the pericardium.—In front of the root of the left lung- there is a vertical fibrous band, the vestigial fold of Marshall. It is formed by the remnant of the lower part of the trunk of the left innominate vein which, after birth, became obhterated, between the branch communicating with the right innominate vein and the back of the heart. Surgical ylnafom^.—Paracentesis of the pericardium is sometimes required in cases of effusion into its cavity.

The Heart The Heart is a hollow muscular organ of a conical form, placed between the lungs, and enclosed in the cavity of the pericardium. Position.—The heart is placed obliquely in the chest: the broad attached end, or base, is directed upwards, backwards, and to the right, and corresponds to the interval between the fifth and eighth dorsal vertebrae ; the apex is directed downwards, forwards, and to the left, and corresponds to the space between the cartilage of the fifth and sixth ribs, three-quarters of an inch to the inner side, and an inch and a half below the left nipple. The heart is placed behind the lower two-thirds of the sternum, and projects further into the left than into the right

NERVOUS SYSTEM 7o8 The longitudinal fissure partially separates the two hemispheres from each other: it divides the two frontal lobes in front; and on raising the cerebellum and pons, it will be seen completely separating the two occipital lobes. Of these two portions of the longitudinal fissure, that which separates the occipital lobes is the longer. The intermediate portion of the fissure is filled up by the great trans- verse band of white matter, the corpus callosum. In the fissure between the two frontal lobes the anterior cerebral arteries ascend on the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum terminates at the base of the brain by a concave margin, which is connected with the tuber cinereum through the intervention of a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. This may be exposed by gently raising Fig. 423.â€”Base of the brain. Frontal lube Posterior division of Sylvia77 fissure Teviporo- ''lenoida I lobe Occipital lobe and drawing back the optic commissure. A white band may be observed on each side, passing from the under surface of the corpus callosum, backwards and outwards, to the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius : these bands are called the peduncles of the corpus callosum. They may be traced upwards around the genu to become continuous with the strice longituclinales, or nerves of Lancisi, on the upper surface of the corpus callosum (page 712). Laterally, this portion of the corpus callosum extends into the frontal lobe. The lamina cinerea is a thin layer of grey substance, extending backwards above the optic commissure from the termination of the corpus callosum to the tuber cinereum ; it is continuous on each side with the grey matter of the anterior perforated space, and forms the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle.

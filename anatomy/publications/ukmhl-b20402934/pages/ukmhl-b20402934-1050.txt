THE URINARY ORGANS lOOO and presenting thick bright rods or markings, which render the striation much more distinct than in any other section of the urinary tubules (fig. 589, h). In the distal convoluted tubule the epithelium appears to be identical with that which has been described as existing in the proximal convoluted tubule (fig. 589, b).

In the straight tubes the epithelium is more or less columnar : in its papillary portion the cells are distinctly columnar and transparent (figs. 591, 592,); but as the tube approaches the cortex the cells are less uniform in shape ; some are polyhedral, and others angular with short processes (fig. 589, f and g).

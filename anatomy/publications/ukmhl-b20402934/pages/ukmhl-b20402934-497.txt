451 POSTERIOR SCAPULAR REGION Nerves.—It is supplied by the upper and lower subscapular nerves. Actions.—The Subscapularis rotates the head of the humerus inwards ; when the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. It is a powerful defence to the front of the shoulder-joint, preventing displacement of the head of the bone forwards. Posterior Scapulae Region (fig. 305) Supraspinatus. Teres minor. Infraspinatus. Teres major. Dissection.—T^o expose these muscles, and to examine their mode of insertion into the humerus, detach the Deltoid and Trapezius from their attachment to the spine of the scapula and acromion process. Remove the clavicle by dividing the ligaments connecting Fig. 305.—Muscles on the dorsum of the scapula and the Triceps. it with the coracoid process, and separate it at its articulation with the scapula: divide the acromion process near its root with a saw. The fragments being removed, the tendons of the posterior Scapular muscles will be fully exposed, and can be examined. A block should be placed beneath the shoulder-joint, so as to make the muscles tense. The supraspinous fascia is a thick and dense membranous layer, which com- pletes the osseo-fibrous case in which the Supraspinatus muscle is contained ; affording attachment, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of the muscle. It is thick internally, but thinner externally under the coraco-acromial ligament. When this fascia is removed, the Supraspinatus muscle is exposed. The Supraspinatus muscle occupies the whole of the supraspinous fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, and from the strong fascia which covers its sur- face. The muscular fibres converge to a tendon, which passes across the capsular G G 2

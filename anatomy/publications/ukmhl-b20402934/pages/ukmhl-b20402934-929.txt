879 STRUCTUEE OF THE TEETH continuous with the processes of the connective-tissue cells of the pulp-matrix. According to some anatomists, the processes of the odontoblasts are also continued into the dentine tubuli. The solid portion of the tooth consists of three distinct structures, viz. the proper dental substance, which forms the larger portion of the tooth, the ivory or dentine; a layer which covers Fig. 512.—Vertical the exposed part of the crown, the enamel; and a thin section of a molar layer, which is disposed on the surface of the fang, the cement or crusta petrosa. The ivory, or dentine (fig. 513), forms the principal mass of a tooth; in its central part is the cavity enclosing the pulp. It is a modification of osseous tissue, from which it differs, however, in structure. On microscopic examination, it is seen to consist of a number of minute wavy and branching tubes, having distinct parietes. They are called the dental tuhuli, and are embedded in a dense homogeneous substance, the intertubular tissue. The dental tubuli (fig. 514) are placed parallel with one another, and open at their inner ends into the pulp-cavity. In their course to the periphery they present two or three curves, and are twisted on themselves in a spiral direction. The direction of these tubes varies : they are vertical in the upper portion of the crown, oblique in the neck and upper part of the root, and towards the lower part of the Fig, 514.—Canine tooth of man, present- ing a transverse section of a portion of the root. (Magnified 300 diameters.) root they are inchned downwards. The tubuli, at their commencement, are about ^3^0 0 of an inch in diameter; in their course they divide and subdivide dichotomously, so as to give to the cut surface of the dentine a striated appear- ance. From the sides of the tubes, especially in the fang, ramifications of extreme minuteness are given off, which join together in loops in the intertubular

385 SUPEEFICIAL CERVICAL EEGION the root of the neck this middle lamella can be traced downwards into the thorax to become continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The posterior lamella passes on the inner side of the carotid vessels, and speedily joins the layer passing- behind them, thus enclosing them in a sheath. The layer of cervical fascia which passes behind the carotid vessels, having been joined by the posterior of the three lamellae from the layer of fascia passing in front of the vessels, is prolonged inwards, behind the pharynx and oesophagus, forming a sheath for the Prevertebral muscles, the prevertebral fascia. The layer of the deep cervical Fig. 275.â€”Section of the neck at about the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. Showing the arrangement of the deep cervical fascia. fascia, which passes behind the Sterno-mastoid, gives off another lamella which passes downwards and outwards over the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, to assist in forming the axillary sheath. The two layers of the deep cervical fascia, where they unite opposite the angle of the lower jaw, bind the Sterno-mastoid muscle to this part of the bone. From that portion of the cervical fascia which is attached to the angle of the jaw, a process of extreme density is found passing behind to the inner side of the parotid gland, to be attached to the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone ; this is termed the Stylo-maxillary ligament.

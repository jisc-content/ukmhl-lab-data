NERVOUS SYSTEM lobe which begins just. 11 front of the anterior perforated space at the base of the brain; it ascends in front of the genu of the corpus callosnm, and runs backwards along the upper surface of this body to its posterior extremity, where it joins the uncinate convolution. It is bounded above in the greater part of its extent by the calloso-marginal fissure, which separates it from the marginal convolution ; behind the spot where this fissure turns upwards it is continuous with the quadrate lobe. The marginal convolution is situated above the preceding, and has received its name from its position along the border of the hemisphere. It commences in front of the anterior perforated space, runs along the margin of the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the orbital lobe, being bounded externally by the sulcus for Fig. 420.â€”Top view of the brain of man, showing the localisation of various functions. (iVfter Ferrier.) Eeferences the same as in the preceding figure. the olfactory tract; it then turns upwards to the upper surface of the hemisphere, and runs backwards, forming the marginal convolution, on the inner surface, to the point where the calloso-marginal fissure turns upwards to reach the superior border of the hemisphere. The quadrate lobe {inecuneus) is the marginal convolution of the longitudinal fissure behind the calloso-marginal sulcus, lying between this fissure in front and the internal parieto-occipital behind. It joins the gyrus fornicatus below, and is continuous above with the superior parietal convolution. The cnneate or occipital lobule is triangular in shape, being situated between the internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures, which, as above mentioned, meet behind the posterior extremity of the gyrus fornicatus. The uncinate or internal occipito-temporal convolution extends from the

Dissection (fig. 283).—Lay open the pharynx from behind, by a vertical incision extending from its upper to its lower part, and partially divide the occipital attachment by a transverse incision on each side of "the vertical one ; the posterior surface of the soft palate is then exposed. Having fixed the uvula so as to make it tense, the mucous mem- brane and glands should be carefully removed from the posterior surface of the soft palate and the muscles of this part are at once exposed. The Levator palati is a long, thick, rounded muscle, placed on the outer side of the posterior nares. It arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous Fig. 283.—Muscles of the soft x^alate. The pharynx being laid ojjen from behind. portion of the temporal bone, and from the adjoining cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube ; after passing into the pharynx, above the upper concave margin of the Superior constrictor, it passes obliquely downwards and inwards, its fibres spreading out in the soft palate as far as the middle line, where they blend with those of the opposite side. Relations.—Externally, with the Tensor palati and Superior constrictor. Internally, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Posteriorly, with the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus, the Azygos uvuIpb, and the mucous lining of the soft palate.

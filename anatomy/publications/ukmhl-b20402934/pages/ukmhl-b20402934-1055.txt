SUPKARENAL CAPSULES :oo5 in width, and from two to three hnes in thickness. Their average weight is about a drachm each. Relations.â€”The relations of the suprarenal capsules differ on the two sides of the body. The right suprarenal presents on its anterior surface two areas ; along its upper and inner borders a depressed area, which is in contact in front with the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and along its inner border with the inferior vena cava (Rolleston), and behind rests on the crus of the Diaphragm ; over the remainder of the anterior surface is an elevated area, which is covered in front by peritoneum, passing from the upper part of the kidney to the under Fig. 597. surface of the liver, and behind rests on the upper and inner part of the kidney. The left suprarenal is in contact by its an- terior surface, superiorly, with the spleen ; below and internal to this, it is in contact Fig. 596.--Vertical section of the suprarenal capsule.

Frameiuorh Nuclei :ziZZ Capillary with the peritoneum forming the lesser sac, which separates it from the cardiac extremity of the stomach ; and at its lower part it is covered by the pancreas and splenic artery, and is therefore not in contact with the peritoneum. By its posterior surface, at its outer and back part it rests upon the kidney; whilst below and internally it is in contact with the left crus of the Diaphragm. The surface of the suprarenal gland is surrounded by areolar tissue containing much fat, and closely invested by a thin fibrous coat, which is difficult to remove, on account of the numerous fibrous processes and vessels which enter the organ through the furrows on its anterior surface and base. Small accessory suprarenals are often to be found in the connective tissue

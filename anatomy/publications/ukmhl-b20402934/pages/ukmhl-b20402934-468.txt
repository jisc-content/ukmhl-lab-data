MUSCLES AND FASCIA 422 from side to side, somewhat fan-shaped, the broad elUptical portion being hori- zontal, the narrow part, which represents the handle of the fan, vertical, and joined at right angles to the former. It is from this circumstance that some anatomists describe it as consisting of two portions, the upper or great muscle of the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax; being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform cartilage ; on either side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or seven inferior ribs, interdigitating with the Transver- salis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum et internmn, and to the lumbar vertebra. The fibres from these sources vary in length ; those arising from the ensiform appendix are very short and Fig. 290.â€”The Diaphragm. Under surface. occasionally aponeurotic; those from the ligamenta arcuata, and more especially those from the cartilages of the ribs at the side of the chest, are longer, describe well-marked curves as they ascend, and finally converge to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon. Between the sides of the muscular slip from the ensiform appendix and the cartilages of the adjoining ribs, the fibres of the Diaphragm are deficient, the interval being filled by areolar tissue, covered on the thoracic side by the pleurge; on the abdominal, by the peritoneum. This is, consequently, a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen may protrude into the chest, forming phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia, or a collection of pus in the mediastinum may descend through it, so as to point at the epigastrium. The ligamentum arcuatujn internum is a tendinous arch, thrown across the upper part of the Psoas magnus muscle, on each side of the spine. It is connected, by one end, to the outer side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, being

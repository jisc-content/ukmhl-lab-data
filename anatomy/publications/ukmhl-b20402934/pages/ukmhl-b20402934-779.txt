CEEEBELLUM the incisura cerehelli ]Josterior, in which is received the upper part of the falx cerebelli. The superior vermiform process (upper part of the median lobe of the cerebellum) extends from the notch on the anterior to that on the posterior border. Upon the upper surface of each hemisphere there are two lobes, separated from each other by a fissure. These are the anterior or square lobe, which extends as Fig. 433.—Upper surface of the cerebellum. far back as the posterior edge of the vermiform process; and the ^posterior or semilunar lohe, which passes from the termination of the preceding to the great horizontal fissure. The under surface of the cerebellum (fig. 434) is subdivided into two lateral hemispheres by a depression, the vallecula or valley, which extends from before backwards in the middle line. These lateral hemispheres are lodged in the inferior Fig. 434.—Under surface of the cerebellum. occipital fossae ; the median depression, or valley, receives the back part of the medulla oblongata, is broader in the centre than at either extremity, and has projecting from its floor part of the median lobe of the cerebellum, called the inferior vermiform process. Upon the under surface of each hemisphere there are five lobes, separated by sulci; these are, from before backwards : (i) the flocculus or subpecluncular lobe, a

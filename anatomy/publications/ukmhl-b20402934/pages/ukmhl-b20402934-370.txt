324 AKTICULATIONS off; or divided with a narrow saw in situ and subsequently removed. The section should be made, if possible, just below the articular surface, so as to leave the bone as lon»- as possible. The glenoid cavity must then be examined, and gouged if carious. V. Elbow-Joint The Elbow is a ginglymus or hinge-joint. The bones entering into its forma- tion are the trochlear surface of the humerus, "which is received into the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and admits of the movements peculiar to this joint, viz. flexion and extension ; whilst the lesser, or radial, head of the humerus articulates with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius ; the circumference of the head of the radius articulates with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, allowing of the movement of rotation of the radius on the ulna, the chief action of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. ' The articular surfaces are covered with a thin layer of cartilage, and connected together by a capsular ligament of unequal thickness, being especially thickened on its two sides and, to a less extent, in front and behind. These thickened portions are usually described as distinct ligaments under the following names :— Anterior. Internal Lateral. Posterior. External Lateral. The orbicular ligament of the upper radio-ulnar articulation must also be reckoned among the ligaments of the elboAV. The Anterior Ligament (fig. 245) is a broad and thin fibrous layer, which covers the anterior surface of the joint. It is attached to the front of the internal

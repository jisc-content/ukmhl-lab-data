447 ANTEEIOE THORACIC REGION between the clavicle and the first rib. It arises by a short, thick tendon from the first rib and its cartilage at their junction, in front of the rhomboid ligament; the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely upwards and outwards, to be inserted into a deep groove on the under surface of the middle third of the clavicle. Relations.—By its upper surface, with the clavicle. By its under surface, it is separated from the first rib by the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus of nerves. Its anterior surface is separated from the Pectoralis major by the costo-coracoid membrane, which, with the clavicle, forms an osseo-fibrous sheath in which the muscle is enclosed. If the costal attachment of the Pectoralis minor is divided across, and the muscle reflected outwards, the axillary vessels and nerves are brought fully into view, and should be examined. Fig. 303.—Muscles of the chest and front of the arm, with the boundaries of the axilla. Nerves.—The Pectoral muscles are supplied by the anterior thoracic nerves ; the Subclavius, by a filament from the cord formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Actions.—If the arm has been raised by the Deltoid, the Pectoralis major will, conjointly with the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major, depress it to the side of the chest. If acting alone, it adducts and draws forwards the arm, bringing it across the front of the chest, and at the same time rotates it inwards. The Pectorahs minor depresses the point of the slioulder, drawing the scapula downwards and inwards to the thorax, and throwing the inferior angle backwards. The Subclavius depresses the shoulder, drawing the clavicle downwards and forwards. When

720 NEEVOUS SYSTEM fornix, and part of the anterior commissure ; behind, by the posterior commissure, and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. The cavity of the third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, named, from their position, antei'ior, middle, and posterior. The anterior commissure is a round bundle of white fibres, placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, and appears to connect together the corpora striati. It passes outwards through the corpus striatum on each side, and then curves backwards into the substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The middle or soft commissure consists almost entirely of grey matter. It connects together the optic thalami, and is continuous with the grey matter lining Fig. 430.â€”The third and fourth ventricles. An arrow has been placed in the position of the foramen of Monro. the anterior part of the third ventricle. It is frequently broken in examining the brain, and might then be supposed to be wanting. The posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white band of fibres, and appears to connect together the optic thalami posteriorly. It consists of decussating fibres which come from the tegmentum of the crus cerebri on one side, and pass through the optic thalami, across the back part of the third ventricle, to the white substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the other side. Some of the fibres may also serve as commissural fibres between the optic thalami. It bounds the third ventricle posteriorly, above the opening of the Sylvian aqueduct. The pineal gland is placed above it and connected to its upper surface. The third ventricle has four openings connected with it. In front are the two oval apertures of the foramina of Monro, one on each side, through which the

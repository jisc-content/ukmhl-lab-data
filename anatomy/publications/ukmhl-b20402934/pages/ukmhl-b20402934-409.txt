OF THE PHALANGES 363 the joint between the fifth metatarsal bone and the cuboid is easily found by the projection of the fifth metatarsal bone, which is the guide to it. The direction of the line of the joint is ver}' oblique, so that, if continued onwards, it would pass through the head of the first metatarsal bone. The joint between the fourth metatarsal bone and the cuboid and external cuneiform is the direct continuation inwards of the previous joint, but its plane is less oblique ; it would be represented by a line drawn from the outer side of the arti- culation to the middle of the first metatarsal bone. The plane of the joint between the third metatarsal bone and the external cuneiform is almost transverse. It would be represented by a line drawn from the outer side of the joint to the base of the first meta- tarsal bone. The tarso-metatarsal articulation of the great toe corresponds to a groove which can be felt by making firm pressure on the inner side of the foot one inch in front of the tubercle on the navicular bone ; and the joint between the second metatarsal bone and the middle cuneiform is to be found on the dorsum of the foot, half an inch behind the level of the tarso-metatarsal joint of the great toe. The line of the joints between the metatarsal bones and the first phalanges is about an inch behind the webs of the corresponding toes.

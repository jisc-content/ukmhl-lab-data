TIBIA 267 The Shaft of the tibia is of a triangular prisriioid form, broad above, gradually decreasing in size to its most slender part, at the commencement of its lower fourth, where fracture most fre- quently occurs ; it then enlarges again towards its lower extre- mity. It presents for examina- tion three borders and three sur- faces. The anterior border, the most prominent of the three, is called the crest of the tibia, or, in popular language, the shin ; it commences above at the tubercle, and terminates below at the anterior margin of the inner malleolus. This border is very prominent in the upper two- thirds of its extent, smooth and rounded below. It presents a very flexuous course, being usually curved outwards above, and in- wards below ; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. The internal border is smooth and rounded above and be- low, but more prominent in the centre; it commences at the back part of the inner tuberosity, and terminates at the posterior border of the internal malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee to the extent of about two inches, and to some fibres of the Popliteus muscle; its middle third, to some fibres of the Soleus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The external border, or in- terosseous ridge, is thin and prominent, especially its central part,, and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the tibia and fibula. The internal surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than below ; its upper third, directed forwards and Fig. 220.â€”Bones of the right leg. Anterior surface. Head External malleolus

ANTERIOK VERTEBRAL REGION 401 parallel to the cleft and just internal to the hamiilar process, in such a position as to avoid the posterior palatine artery. 7. Anterior Vertebral Region Rectus capitis anticus major. Rectus capitis lateralis. Rectus capitis anticus minor. Longus colli. The Rectus capitis anticus major (fig. 284), broad and thick above, narrow below, appears like a continuation upwards of the Scalenus anticus. It arises by Fig. 284.—The prevertebral muscles. four tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and ascends, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the pharynx, the sympathetic nerve, and the sheath enclosing the internal and common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. By its ]josterior surface, with the Longus colli, the Rectus capitis anticus minor, and the upper cervical vertebrae. The Rectus capitis anticus minor is a short, flat muscle, situated immediately behind the upper part of the preceding. It arises from the anterior surface of the lateral mass of the atlas, and from the root of its transverse process, and passing obliquely upwards and inwards, is inserted into the basilar process immediately behind the preceding muscle. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Rectus capitis anticus major. By posterior surface, with the front of the occipito-atlantal articulation. D D

OEIQIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BODY THE whole body is developed out of the ovum (fig. 72) when fertilised by the spermatozoa. The ovum is merely a simple nucleated cell, or collection of protoplasm, and the spermatozoa disappear when they have accomplished their mysterious function. All the complicated changes by which the various intricate organs of the whole body are formed from one simple cell may be reduced to two general processes, viz. the segmentation or cleavage of cells, and their differentia- tion. The former process consists in the splitting of the nucleus and its investing cell-wall, whereby the original cell is represented by two. The differentiation of cells is a term used to describe that unknoAvn power or tendency impressed on cells which, to all methods of examination now known, seem absolutely identical, whereby they grow into different forms ; so that (to take the first instance which occurs in the growth of the embryo) the indifferent cells of the vascular area are differen- tiated, some of them into blood-globules, others into the solid tissue which forms the blood-vessels. The extreme complexity of the process of development renders Fig. 73.â€”Human ovum from a middle-sized follicle. vT Vitelline membrane or zottu pellu- cidn. b.

I can only hope to render the leading features of the process tolerably plain, and must refer the reader who wishes to follow the various changes more minutely to the special works on the subject, and especially the work of Foster and Balfour. Many of the statements which are accepted in human embryology are made only on the strength of experiments on the lower animals, direct observation on the human subject being impossible. The ovum is a small spheroidal body situated in immature Graafian vesicles near their centre, but in the mature ones in contact with the membrana granulosa,* at that part of the vesicle which projects from the surface of the ovary. The cells of the membrana granulosa are accumulated round the ovum in greater number than at any other part of the vesicle, forming a kind of granular zone, the discus proligems. The human ovum (fig. 73) is extremely minute, measuring from t^o of * See the description of the ovary at a future page.

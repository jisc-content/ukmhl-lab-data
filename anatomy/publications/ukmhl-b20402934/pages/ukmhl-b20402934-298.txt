The Pelvis (figs. 210, 211) The Pelvis, so called from its resemblance to a basin (L. pelvis), is stronger and more massively constructed than either the cranial or thoracic cavity ; it is a bony ring, interposed between the lower end of the spine, which it supports, and the lower extremities, upon which it rests. It is composed of four bones : the two ossa innominata, which bound it on either side and in front; and the sacrum and coccyx, which complete it behind. The pelvis is divided by a plane passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the linea ilio-pectinea, and the upper margin of the symphysis pubis, into the false and true pelvis. The false pelvis is all that expanded portion of the pelvic cavity which is situated above this plane. It is bounded on each side by the ossa ilii ; in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the spinous processes of the ilia on either side, which is filled up in the recent state by the parietes of the abdomen ;

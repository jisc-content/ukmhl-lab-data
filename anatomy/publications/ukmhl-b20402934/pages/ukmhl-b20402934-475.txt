OF THE ABDOMEN 429 than the rest, arch downwards and inwards across the spermatic cord, and, becoming tendinous, are inserted, conjointly with those of the Transversalis, into the crest of the OS pubis and pectineal line, to the extent of half an inch, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and TransversaHs ; those from the anterior third of the iliac origin are horizontal in their direction, and, becoming tendinous along the lower fourth of the linea semilunaris, pass in front of the Eectus muscle to be inserted into the linea alba ; those which arise from the middle third of the origin from the crest of the ilium pass obliquely upwards and inwards, and terminate in an aponeurosis, which divides opposite the linea semilunaris into two lamellaB, which are continued forwards, in front and behind the Eectus muscle to the linea alba ; the posterior lamella being also connected to the cartilages Fig. 293.â€”The Internal oblique muscle. of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs; the most posterior fibres pass almost vertically upwards, to be inserted into the lower borders of the cartilages of the three lower ribs, being continuous with the Internal intercostal muscles. The conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis is inserted into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, immediately behind the external abdominal ring, serving to protect what would otherwise be a weak point in the abdominal wall. Sometimes this tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and is carried forward in front of the protrusion through the external ring, forming one of the coverings of direct inguinal hernia; or the hernia forces its way through the fibres of the conjoined tendon. The aponeurosis of the Internal oblique is continued forward to the middle line of the abdomen, where it joins with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle at the

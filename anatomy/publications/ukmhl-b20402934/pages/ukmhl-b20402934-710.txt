662 LYMPHATICS a gland, divides into several small branches, which are named afferent vessels. As they enter, their external coat becomes continuous with the capsule of the giand, and the vessels, much thinned, and consisting only of their internal or endothelial coat, pass into the gland, and Fig. 394.â€”The thoracic and right lymphatic duct. Bigh lympli civ t branch out upon and in the tissue of the capsule ; these branches opening into the lymph sinuses of the gland. From these sinuses fine branches proceed to form a plexus, the vessels of which unite to form a single efferent vessel, which, on emerging from the giand, is again invested with an external coat. Further details on the minute anatomy of the lymphatic vessels and glands will be found in the chapter on General Anatomy. Thoracic Duct The thoracic duct (fig. 394) conveys the great mass of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, excepting those of the right side of the head, neck, and thorax, and right upper extremity, the right lung, right side of the heart, and the convex surface of the liver. It varies in length from fifteen to eighteen inches in the adult, and ex- tends from the second lumbar vertebra to the foot of the neck. It commences in the abdomen by a triangular dila- tation, the receiotaculum chyli (reservoir or cistern of Pec- quet), which is situated upon the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, to the right side and behind the aorta, by the side of the right crus of the Diaphragm. It as- cends into the thorax through the aortic opening in the Dia- phragm, lying to the right of the aorta, and is placed in the posterior mediastinum in front of the vertebral column, lying between the aorta and vena azygos major. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra, it inchnes towards the left side and ascends behind the arch of the aorta, on the left side of the oesophagus, and behind the first portion of the left subclavian artery to the

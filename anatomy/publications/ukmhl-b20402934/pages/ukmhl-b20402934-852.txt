802 SPINAL NERVES which supply the integument between the anus and coccyx. Another cutaneous branch is frequently given off from this nerve, though sometimes from the pudic (Schwalbe). It perforates the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and, winding round the lower border of the Gluteus maximus, supplies the skin over the lower and inner part of this muscle. The fifth anterior sacral nerve, after passing from the lower end of the sacral canal, curves forwards through the fifth sacral foramen, formed between the lower part of the sacrum and the transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx. It pierces the Coccygeus muscle, and descends upon its anterior surface to near the tip of the coccyx, where it again perforates the muscle, to be distributed to the integument over the back part and side of the coccyx. This nerve communicates Fig. 469.â€”Side view of pelvis, showing sacral nerves. above with the fourth sacral, and below with the coccygeal nerve, and supplies the Coccygeus muscle. The anterior division of the coccygeal nerve is a delicate filament which escapes at the termination of the sacral canal; it passes downwards behind the rudimentary transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx, and curves forwards, through the notch between the first and second pieces, piercing the Coccygeus muscle and descending on its anterior surface to near the tip of the coccyx, where it again pierces the muscle, to be distributed to the integument over the back part and side of the coccyx. It is joined by a branch from the fifth anterior sacral as it descends on the surface of the Coccygeus muscle. Sacral Plexus (fig. 469) The sacral plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves, and part of that of the fourth. These nerves proceed in different directions; the upper ones obliquely downwards and outwards, the

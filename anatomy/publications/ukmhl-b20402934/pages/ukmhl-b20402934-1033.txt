983 THE LUNGS The Lungs The Lungs are the essential organs of respiration ; they are two in number, placed one on each side of the chest, separated from each other by the heart and other contents of the mediastinum. Each lung is conical in shape, and presents for examination an apex, a base, two borders, and two surfaces (see fig. 579). The apex forms a tapering cone which extends into the root of the neck, about an inch to an inch and a half above the level of the first rib. The base is broad, concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the Dia- phragm ; its circumference is thin, and fits into the space between the lower ribs and the costal attachment of the Diaphragm, extending lower down externally and behind than in front. The external or thoracic surface is smooth, convex, of considerable extent. Fig. 578.â€”Transverse section through the upper margin of the third dorsal vertebra. (Branne.) LT CAROTID / and corresponds to the form of the cavity of the chest, being deeper behind than in front. The inner surface is concave. It presents, in front, a depression corresponding to the convex surface of the pericardium ; and behind, a deep fissure (the hilum pulmonis), which gives attachment to the root of the lung. The posterior border is rounded and broad, and is received into the deep con- cavity on either side of the spinal column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects, below, between the ribs and the Diaphragm. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the peri- cardium. Each lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and lower, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the upper part of the posterior border of the organ, about three inches from its apex, downw^ards and forwards to the lower part of its anterior border. This fissure penetrates nearly to the root. In the right lung the upper lobe is partially subdivided by a second and shorter fissure, which extends

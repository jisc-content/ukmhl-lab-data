I20 THE SKELETON in any other region of the spine. The lamince, are broad, thick, and imbricated— that is to say, overlapping one another hke tiles on a roof. The spinal foramen is small, and of a circular form. The spinous in'ocesses are long, triangular in form (bayonet-shaped), directed obliquely downwards, and terminate in a tubercular extremity. They overlap one another from the fifth to the eighth, but are less oblique in direction above and below. The articular processes are flat, nearly Fig. 114.—Peculiar dorsal vertebrae. ^ An entire facet above ( a denii-facet below A denii-facet above entire facet n entire facet o facet on trans. ])roc. hicli is riidiinoitdnj n entire facet (No facet on transv. -i Infer. artic.jJTOcess convex and turned [ outivard vertical in direction, and project from the upper and lower part of the pedicles; the superior being directed backwards and a little outwards and upwards, the inferior forwards and a Httle iuAvards and downwards. The transverse processes arise from the same parts of the arch as the posterior roots of the transverse processes in the neck, and are situated behind the articular processes and pedicles ; they are thick, strong, and of great length, directed obliquely backwards and outwards, presenting a clubbed extremity, which is tipped on its anterior part by a small,

LATERAL VERTEBRAL REGION The Scalenus posticus, the smallest of the three Scaleni, arises, by two or three separate tendons, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower two or three cervical vertebrae, and, diminishing as it descends, is inserted by a thin tendon into the outer surface of the second rib, behind the attachment of the Serratus magnus. This is the most deeply placed of the three Scaleni, and is occasionally blended with the Scalenus medius. Nerves.—The Rectus capitis anticus major and minor and the Rectus lateralis are supplied by the first cervical nerve, and from the loop formed between it and Fig. 285.—Muscles of the neck.

STYLO-GLOSSUS - -STERNO-HYOIO the second; the Longus colli and Scaleni, by branches from the anterior divisions of the lower cervical nerves (fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth) before they form the brachial plexus. The Scalenus medius also receives a filament from the deep external branches of the cervical plexus. Actions.—The Rectus anticus major and minor are the direct antagonists of the muscles at the back of the neck, serving to restore the head to its natural position after it has been drawn backwards. These muscles also serve to flex the head, and, from their obliquity, rotate it, so as to turn the face to one or the other side. The Longus colli flexes and slightly rotates the cervical portion of the spine. The D D 2

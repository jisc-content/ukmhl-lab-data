OF THE CAETILAGES OF THE RIBS sternum; but it is sometimes absent in the sixth and seventh chondro-sternal joints. Thus there are eight synovial cavities on each side in the articulations between the costal cartilages of the true ribs and the sternum. After middle life the articular surfaces lose their polish, become roughened, and the synovial Fig. 238.—Chondro-sternal, chondro-xiphoid, and interchondral articulations. Anterior view. The synovial cavities exposed hy a vertical section of the sternum and cartilages membranes appear to be wanting. In old age, the articulations do not exist, the cartilages of most of the ribs becoming continuous with the sternum. Actions.—The movements which are permitted in the chondro-sternal articu- lations are limited to elevation and depression, and these only to a slight extent.

OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA 1053 Inguinal Heenia Inguinal hernia is that form of protrusion which makes its way through the abdomen in the inguinal region. There are two principal varieties of inguinal hernia—external or oblique, and internal or direct. External or oblique inguinal hernia, the more frequent of the two, takes the same course as the spermatic cord. It is called external, from the neck of the sac being on the outer or iliac side of the deep epigastric artery. Internal or direct inguinal hernia does not follow the same course as the cord, but protrudes through the abdominal wall on the inner or pubic side of the deep epigastric artery.

Oblique Inguinal Heenia In oblique inguinal hernia the intestine escapes from the abdominal cavity at the internal ring, pushing before it a pouch of peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac (fig. 625, a)^. As it enters the inguinal canal it receives an investment from the subserous areolar tissue, and is enclosed in the infundibuliform process of the transversahs fascia. In passing along the inguinal canal it displaces upwards he arched fibres of the Transversahs and Internal obhque muscles, and is surrounded by the fibres of the Cremaster. It then passes along the front of the cord and escapes from the inguinal canal at the external ring, receiving an investment from

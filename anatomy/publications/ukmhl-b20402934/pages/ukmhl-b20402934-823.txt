CEEVICAL 773 joined beneath the Complexus by communicating branches. This communication is described by Cruveilhier as the ^posterior cervical plexus. The posterior divisions of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves (fig. 463) pass backwards, and divide, behind the Posterior intertransverse muscles, into internal and external branches. The internal branches, the larger, are distributed differently in the upper and lower part of the neck. Those derived from the fourth and fifth nerves pass between the Complexus and Semispinahs muscles, and, having reached the spinous processes, perforate the aponeurosis of Fig. 456.â€”Posterior divisions of the upper cervical nerves. the Splenius and Trapezius, and are continued outwards to the integument over the Trapezius, whilst those derived from the three lowest cervical nerves are the smallest, and are placed beneath the Semispinahs colh, which they supply, and then pass into the Interspinales, Multifidus spin^e and Complexus, and~ send twigs through this latter muscle to supply the integument near the spinous processes (Hu^schfeld). The external branches supply the muscles at the side of the neck, VIZ. the Cervicalis ascendens, TransversaHs colli, and Trachelo-mastoid.

The radiating arrangement of protoplasmic granules is also indicated, although it is in the ova of the lower animals that this appearance has been more specially studied. All tne figures are simplified for diagrammatic purposes, but represent stages which can easily be recognised in specimens properly stained. The longitudinal splitting of the filaments has not been represented, as it is probably ot secondary importance. The polar ends of the loops, often, if not always, break across like the equatorial end : this is purposely not represented in the diagram. A. Resting nucleus, the nuclear network deeply stained. B.

Delepine.) and it may be that it will hereafter be shown that the division of cells always takes place in this way, and that the process of reproduction of cells by direct

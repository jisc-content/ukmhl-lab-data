697 CONVOLUTIONS OF CEREBEUM in different brains, nor are they exactly symmetrical on the two sides of the same brain, but their general arrangement or plan is fairly constant. Certain infoldings of the cerebrum take place at an early period of development and form important landmarks, which are constant and can without difficulty be recognised; but the secondary depressions and convolutions vary considerably. The number and extent of the convolutions, as well as their depth, appear to bear a close relation to the intellectual power of the individual, as is shown in their increasing complexity of arrangement as we ascend from the lowest mammalia up to man. Thus they are absent in some of the lower orders of mammalia, and they increase in number and extent through the higher orders. In man they present the most complex arrangement.

In old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activity, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. The convolutions on the outer convex surface of the hemisphere are the largest and most complicated convolutions of the brain; their general direction is more or less oblique ; they frequently branch like the letter Y in their course upwards and backwards, towards the longitudinal fissure: these convolutions attain their greatest development in man, and are especially characteristic of the human brain.

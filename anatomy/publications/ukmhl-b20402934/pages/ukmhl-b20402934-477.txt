OF THE ABDOMEN 431 fourths ; from the inner surface of the cartilages of the six lower ribs, interdigitating with the Diaphragm ; and by the lumbar fascia from the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The muscle terminates in front in a broad aponeurosis, the lower fibres of which curve downwards and inwards, and are inserted, together with those of the Internal oblique, into the lower part of the linea alba, the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis. Throughout the Fig. 294.—The Transversalis, Rectus, and Pyramidalis muscles. rest of its extent the aponeurosis j)asses horizontally inwards, and is inserted into the linea alba; its upper three-fourths passing behind the Rectus muscle, blending with the posterior lamella of the Internal oblique; its lower fourth passing in front of the Rectus. Relations.—By its external surface, with the Internal oblique, and the inner surface of the cartilages of the lower ribs. By its internal stirface, with the fascia transversalis, which separates it from the peritoneum. Its lower border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal.

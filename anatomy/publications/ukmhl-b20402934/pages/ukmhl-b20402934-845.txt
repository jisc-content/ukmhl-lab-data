LUMBAR PLEXUS 795 The Ilio-hypogastric Nerve {superior musculo-cutaneous) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It emerges from the outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in front of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its posterior part, near the crest of the ilium, and divides between it and the Internal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric. The iliac branch pierces the Internal and External oblique muscles immediately above the crest of the ilium, and is distributed to the integument of the gluteal region, behind the lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve (fig. 47o)- The size of this nerve bears an inverse proportion to that of the cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve. Fig. 465.â€”The lumbar plexus and its branches. The hypogastric branch (fig. 466) continues onwards between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles. It then pierces the Internal oblique, and near the middle line perforates the aponeurosis of the External oblique, about an inch above, and a little to the outer side of the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the hypogastric region. The ilio-hypogastric nerve communicates with the last dorsal and ilio-inguinal nerves. The Ilio-inguinal Nerve (inferior musculo-cutaneous), smaller than the pre- ceding, arises with it from the first lumbar nerve. It emerges from the outer border of the Psoas just below the ilio-hypogastric, and, passing obliquely across the Quadratus lumborum and Iliacus muscles, perforates the Transversalis, near the

426 MUSCLES AND FASCIA their cartilages. The five superior serrations increase in size from above'down- wards, and are received between corresponding processes of the Serratus magnus • the three lower ones diminish in size from above downwards, receiving between them corresponding processes from the Latissimus dorsi. From these attachments the fleshy fibres proceed in various directions. Those from the lowest ribs pass nearly vertically downwards, to be inserted into the anterior half of the outer Hp of the crest of the ihum ; the middle and upper fibres, directed downwards and forwards, terminate in tendinous fibres, opposite a line drawn from the prominence Ficx. 292.—The External obhque muscle. External abdominal ring Gimbernat's liga^nent j of the ninth costal cartilage to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, which then spread out into a broad aponeurosis. The Aponeurosis of the External Oblique is a thin, but strong membranous aponeurosis the fibres of which are directed obliquely downwards and outwards. It IS joined with that of the opposite muscle along the median line, covers the whole of the front of the abdomen ; above, it is connected with the lower border ot the Pectorahs major; below, its fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend obhquely across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine

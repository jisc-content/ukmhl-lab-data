984 OEGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION from the middle of the preceding, forwards and upwards, to the anterior margin of the organ, marking off a small triangular portion, the middle lobe. The riglit lung is the larger and heavier; it is broader than the left, owing to the inclination of the heart to the left side ; it is also shorter by an inch, in conse- quence of the Diaphragm rising higher on the right side to accommodate the liver. The root of the lungs.—A little above the middle of the inner surface of each lung, and nearer its posterior than its anterior border, is its root, by which the lung is connected to the heart and the trachea. The root is formed by the bronchial tube, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, the bronchial arteries and veins, the pulmonary plexus of nerves, lymphatics, bronchial glands, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a reflection of the pleura. The root of the right lung lies Fig. 579.—Front view of the heart and lungs. behind the superior vena cava and ascending portion of the aorta, and below the vena azygos major. That of the left lung passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and in front of the descending aorta; the phrenic nerve and the anterior puhnonary plexus lie in front of each, and the pneumogastric and posterior pulmonary plexus behind each. The chief structures composing the root of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from before backwards on both sides, viz. : the pulmonary veins most anterior ; the pulmonary artery in the middle ; and the bronchus, together with the bronchial vessels, behind. From above downwards, on the two sides, their arrangement differs, thus :— On the right side their position is—bronchus, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins ; but on the left side their position is—pulmonary artery, bronchus, pulmonary veins ; this is accounted for by the bronchus being placed on a lower level on the left than on the right side, in order that it may pass under the arch of the aorta.

68o NERVOUS SYSTEM remains. The cells are supported on a layer of neuroglia, which is sometimes called the substantia gelatinosa centralis. The mode of arrangement of the grey matter, and its amount in proportion to the white, vary in different parts of the cord. Thus, the posterior horns are long and narrow, in the cervical region; short and narrower, in the dorsal; short, but wider, in the lumbar region. In the cervical region, the crescentic portions are small, and the white matter more abundant than in any other region of the cord. In the dorsal region, the grey matter is least developed, the white matter being also small in quantity. In the lumbar region, the grey matter is more abundant than Fig. 405.—Transverse section through the cervical portion of the spinal cord of a calf. Magnified 40 diameters. (Klein and Noble Smith.) Septa of connective, tissue in any other region of the cord. Towards the lower end of the cord, the white matter gradually ceases. The crescentic portions of the grey matter soon blend into a single mass, which forms the only constituent of the extreme point of the cord. Minute Anatomy of the Cord.—The cord consists of an outer part, composed of medullated nerve-fibres, which is the lohite substance; and of a central part, the grey matter : both supported in a peculiar kind of connective tissue, called neuroglia. The neuroglia consists of a homogeneous transparent matrix, of a network of very delicate fibrillse, and of small stellate or branched cells, the neuroglia cells. In addition to forming a ground substance, in which the nerve-fibres, nerve-

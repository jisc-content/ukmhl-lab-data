Sackal and Coccygeal Vertebe.^: The Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebrae consist, at an early period of life, of nine separate pieces, which are united in the adult, so as to form two bones, five entering into the formation of the sacrum, four into that of the coccyx. Occasionally, the coccyx consists of five hones.* The Sacrum (sacer, sacred) is a large, triangular bone (fig. 122), situated at the lower part of the vertebral column, and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted like a wedge between the two innominate bones; its upper part, or base, articulating with the last lumbar vertebra, its apex with the coccyx. The sacrum is curved upon itself, and placed very obliquely, its upper extremity projecting forwards, and forming, Avith the last lumbar vertebra, a very prominent angle, called the iwomontory or sacro-vertehral angle ; whilst its central part is directed backwards, so as to give increased capacity to the pelvic cavity. It presents for examination an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral surfaces, a base, an apex, and a central canal. The Anterior Surface is concave from above downwards, and slightly so from side to side. In the middle are seen four transverse ridges, indicating the original * Sir George Humphry describes this as the usual composition of the coccyx.â€” On the SJteleton, p. 456.

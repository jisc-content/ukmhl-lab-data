THE SKELETON 144 nose. This suture usually becomes obliterated within a few years after birth ; but it occasionally remains throughout life. Occasionally secondary centres of ossifica- tion appear for the nasal spine ; one on either side at the internal angular process where it articulates with the lachrymal bone; and sometimes there is one on either side at the lower end of the coronal suture. This latter centre sometimes remains ununited, and is known as the pterion ossicle ; or it may join with the parietal, sphenoid, or temporal bone. Articulations.^—With twelve bones : two parietal, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To three pairs : the Corrugator supercilii. Orbicu- laris palpebrarum, and Temporal, on each side. The Temporal Bones The Temporal Bones (tempus, time) are situated at the sides and base of the skull, and present for examination a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The squamous portion (squama, a scale), the anterior and upper part of the Fig. 138.—Left temporal bone. Outer surface. bone, is scale-like in form, and thin and translucent in texture (fig. 138). Its outer surface is smooth, convex, and grooved at its back part for the deep temporal arteries ; it affords attachment to the Temporal muscle, and forms part of the temporal fossa. At its back part may be seen a curved ridge—part of the temiooral ridge ; it serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia, limits the origin of the Temporal muscle, and marks the boundary between the squamous and mastoid portions of the bone. Projecting from the lower part of the squamous portion is a Fig. 137.—Frontal bone at birth. Developed by two lateral halves.

OF THE HEAD AND NECK 633 The veins of the exterior of the head and face are, the Frontah Temper aL Supra-orbital. Internal Maxillary. Angular. Temporo-maxillary. Facial. Posterior Auricular. Occipital. The frontal vein commences on the anterior part of the skull by a venous plexus which communicates with the anterior tributaries of the temporal vein. The Fig. 381.â€”Veins of the head and neck. veins converge to form a single trunk, which runs downwards near the middle hne of the forehead parallel with the vein of the opposite side, and unites with it at the root of the nose, by a transverse branch, called the nasal arch. Occasionally the frontal veins join to form a single trunk, which bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. At the root of the nose the veins diverge, and join the suijta-orbital vein, at the inner angle of the orbit, to form the angular vein. The supra-orbital vein commences on the forehead, communicating with the

1059 FEMORAL HERNIA the integument of the groin, anastomosing with the deep circmiiflex ihac, and with the ghiteal and external circumflex arteries. The siq^erficial veins.—The veins accompanying these superficial arteries are usually much larger than the arteries : they terminate in the internal or long saphenous vein at the saphenous opening. The superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups : an upper, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament, which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietes of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions, and the mucous membrane of the urethra; and an inferior group, which surround the saphenous opening in Fig. 626.—-Femoral hernia. Superficial dissection. the fascia lata, a few being sometimes continued along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. This latter group receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The ilio-inguinal nerve arises from the first lumbar nerve. It escapes at the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the upper and inner part of the thigh : to the scrotum in the male, and to the labium in the female. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the ilio-hypo- gastric. Occasionally it is very small, and ends by joining the ilio-hypogastric : in such cases a branch of the ilio-hypogastric takes the place of the ilio-inguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent. The crural branch of the genito- crural nerve passes along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, beneath Poupart's ligament, into the thigh, entering the sheath of the femoral vessels, and lying 3 Y 2

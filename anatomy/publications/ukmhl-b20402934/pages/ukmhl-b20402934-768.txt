7i8 NERVOUS SYSTEM upper surface is connected, in the median line, to the septum lucidum in front, and the corpus callosum behind, while laterally this surface forms part of the floor of each lateral ventricle. Its under surface rests upon the velum interpositum, which separates it from the third ventricle, and the inner portion of the optic thalami. Its outer edge, on each side, is in contact with the choroid plexuses. The anterior crura arch downwards towards the base of the brain, separated from each other by a narrow interval. They are composed of white fibres, which descend through a quantity of grey matter in the lateral walls of the third ventricle, and are placed immediately behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain, the white fibres of each crus form a sudden curve upon themselves, and spread out and form the outer part of the corresponding corpus albicans, from Fig. 429.â€”The fornix, velum interpositum, and middle or descending cornn of the lateral ventricle. which point they may be traced upwards into the substance of the corresponding optic thalamus (fig. 431). The anterior crura of the fornix are connected in their course with the peduncle of the pineal gland and the superficial fibres of the taenia semicircularis, and receive fibres from the septum lucidum. Between the anterior crura or pillars of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the optic thalami, an oval aperture is seen on each side : this is the foramen of Monro (fig. 430). The two openings descend towards the middle line, and lead into the upper part of the third ventricle. Through these openings the lateral ventricles on each side communicate with the third ventricle, and - consequently with each other. The posterior crura, at their commencement, are intimately connected by their upper surfaces with the corpus callosum; diverging from one another, they pass

SUEGICAL ANATOMY lower fragments being drawn backwards and upwards by the powerful action of the muscles of the calf; the pointed extremity of the upper fragment projects forwards immediately beneath the integument, often protruding through it, and rendering the fracture a compound one. If the direction of the fracture is the reverse of that shown in the figure, the pointed extremity of the lower fragment pro- Fig. 343.-Fracture of the fibula, with disloca- J^^J^ forwards, riding upon the lower tion of the foot outwards-' Pott's Fracture.' f'^^ the upper one. By bendmg the knee, which relaxes the opposmg muscles, and making extension from the ankle and counter-extension at the knee, the fragments may be brought into apposition. It is often necessary, however, in compound fracture, to re- move a portion of the projecting bone with the saw before complete adapta- tion can be effected. Fracture of the fibula tvitli disloca- tion of the foot outivards (fig. 343), commonly known as ' Pott's Fracture,' is one of the most frequent injuries of the ankle-joint. The end of the tibia is displaced from the corresponding surface of the astragalus; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured ; and the inner malleolus projects inwards be- neath the integument, which is tightly stretched over it, and in danger of bin^st- ing. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occasionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly con- nected below ; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the gronnd, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flexing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making extension from the ankle and counter-extension at the knee.

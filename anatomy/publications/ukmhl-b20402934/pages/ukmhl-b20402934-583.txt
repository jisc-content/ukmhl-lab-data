These vessels also anastomose with the j)osterior palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The tonsillar branch (fig. 352) passes up between the Internal Pterygoid and Stylo-glossus, and then ascends along the side of the pharynx, perforating the Superior constrictor, to ramify in the substance of the tonsil and root of the tongue. * The muscular tissue of the lips must be supposed to have been cut away, in order to show the course of the coronary arteries.

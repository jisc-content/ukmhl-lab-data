viii PREFACE The Editor is deeply indebted to liis friend Mr. Eoss for much kind assistance in the preparation of this edition, and also for the help that he has rendered him in passing these pages through the press. To Dr. Leonard Eemfry he is also much indebted for his kindness in revising the section on the anatomy of the Female Organs of Generation. Several new illustrations have been added, principally from dissections in the Hunterian Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons. The Editor takes this opportunity of thanking Pro- sector Pearson for the kind interest he has displayed, and assist- ance he has rendered, in the preparation of these drawings, which were taken from dissections made by this master in the art of dissecting.

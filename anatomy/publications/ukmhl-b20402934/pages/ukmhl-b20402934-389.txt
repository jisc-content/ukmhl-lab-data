343 KNEE-JOINT mencing midway between the top of the great trochanter and the anterior superior spine, and ending over the shaft, just below the trochanter. The muscles are detached from the great trochanter, and the capsule opened freely. The head and neck are freed from the soft parts and the bone sawn through just below the top of the trochanter with a narrow saw. The head of the bone is then levered out of the acetabulum. In both operations, if the acetabulum is eroded, it must be freely gouged. II. Knee-Joint The knee-joint was formerly described as a gingiymns or hinge-joint, but is really of a much more complicated character. It must be regarded as consisting of three articulations together: one between each condyle of the femur and the Fig. 257.—Eight knee-joint. Anterior Fig. 258.—Eight knee-joint. Posterior view. view. corresponding tuberosity of the tibia, which are condyloid joints, and one between the patella and the femur, which is partly arthrodial, but not completely so, since the articular surfaces are not mutually adapted to each other, so that the movement is not a simple gliding one. This view of the construction of the knee-joint receives confirmation from the study of the articulation in some of the lower mammals, where three synovial membranes are sometimes found, corresponding to these three subdivisions, either entirely distinct or only connected together by small communi- cations. This view is further rendered probable by the existence of the two crucial ligaments within the joint, which must be regarded as the external and internal lateral ligaments of the inner and outer joints respectively. The existence of the ligamentum mucosum would further indicate a tendency to separation of the synovial cavity into two minor sacs, one corresponding to each joint. The bones entering into the formation of the knee-joint are the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front. The bones are

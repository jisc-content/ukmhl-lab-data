MUSCLES AND FASCIA 368 The Skin of the Scalp.â€”This is thicker than in any other part of the body. It is intimately adherent to the superficial fascia. The hair-follicles are very closely set together, and extend throughout the whole thickness of the skin. It also contains a number of sebaceous glands. The superficial fascia in the cranial region is a firm, dense, fibro-fatty layer, intimately adherent to the integument, and to the Occipito-frontalis and its tendinous aponeurosis ; it is continuous, behind, with the superficial fascia at the back part of the neck; and, laterally, is continued over the temporal fascia. It contains between its layers the superficial vessels and nerves and much granular fat. The Occipito-frontalis (fig. 269) is a broad musculo-fibrous layer, which covers the whole of one side of the vertex of the skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It consists of two muscular slips, separated by an intervening tendinous aponeurosis.

714 NERVOUS SYSTEM extension inwards of the calcarine sulcus; this is called the hi2)pocamp2is minor, or calcar avis. Between the middle and posterior horns a smooth eminence is observed, which varies considerably in size in different subjects. It is called the eminentia collateral is. The middle or descending cornu, the largest of the three, traverses the middle lobe of the brain, forming in its course a remarkable curve round the back of the optic thalamus. It passes, at first, backwards, outwards, and downwards, and then curves round the crus cerebri, forwards and inwards, nearly to the point of the middle lobe, close to the fissure of Sylvius. Its upper boundary, or roof, is formed by the fibres of the corpus callosum, passing downwards and outwards into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, with which are incorporated the posterior fibres of the Fig. 426.â€”Middle part of a horizontal section through the cerebrum at the level of the dotted line in the small figure of one hemisphere. (From Ellis, after Dalton.) nucleus caudatus and taenia semicircularis, which are prolonged into it. Its lower boundary, or floor, presents for examination the following parts : the hippocampus major, pes hippocampi, eminentia collateralis, or p)es accessorius, corpus fimhriatum of the fornix, clwroid plexus, fascia dentata, transverse fissure. The corpus striatum has received its name from the striped appearance which its section presents, in consequence of diverging white fibres being mixed with the grey matter which forms the greater part of its substance. The greater portion of this body is embedded in the white substance of the hemisphere, and is there- fore external to the ventricle. It is termed the extrarentricular portion, or the nucleus lenticularis ; a part, however, is visible in the ventricle and its anterior 'cornu ; this is the intraventricular portion, or the jiucleus caudatus. The intra- ventricular portion is a pear-shaped mass of grey matter; its broad extremity is

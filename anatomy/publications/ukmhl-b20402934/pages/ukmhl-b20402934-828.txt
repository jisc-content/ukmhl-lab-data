778 SPINAL NERVES seventh cervical nerve ; and an inner one formed by the junction of the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. As they pass beneath the clavicle, each of these three trunks divides into two branches, an anterior and a ijosterior. The anterior di^dsions of the outer and middle trunks then unite to form a common cord, which is situated on the outer side of the middle part of the axillary artery, and is called the outer cord of the brachial plexus. The anterior division of the inner trunk, formed by the union of the eighth cervical and first dorsal, passes down on the inner side of the axillary artery in the middle of the axilla, and forms the inner cord of the brachial plexus. The posterior divisions of the outer trunk (formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth nerves) and of the middle trunk (the seventh nerve) unite together to form the ijosterior cord of the brachial plexus, which is Fig. 458.â€”Plan of the brachial plexus. FROM 4Ti? situated behind the second portion of the axillary artery. From this posterior cord are given off the two lower subscapular nerves ; the upper subscapular nerve being given off from the posterior division of the outer trunk prior to its junction with the posterior division of the middle trunk. The posterior cord divides into the circumflex and musculo-spiral nerves. The musculo-spiral nerve is subse- quently joined by the posterior division of the inner trunk, formed by the union of the eighth cervical and first dorsal. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by a branch from the fourth to the fifth nerve, and with the phrenic nerve by a branch from the fifth cervical, which joins that nerve on the Anterior scalenus muscle : the cervical and first dorsal nerves are also joined by filaments from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, close to their exit from the intervertebral foramina.

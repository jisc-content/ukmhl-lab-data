THE ORBITS attachment to the Levator angiih oris ; bounded below by the alveolar processes, containing the teeth of the upper and lower jaw. Beneath the alveolar arch of the lower jaw is the mental foramen for the passage of the mental vessels and nerve, the external oblique line, and at the lower border of the bone, at the point of junction of the body with the ramus, a shalloAv groove for the passage of the facial artery. The Debits The Orbits (fig. 175) are two quadrilateral pyramidal cavities, situated at the upper and anterior part of the face, their bases being directed forwards and outwards, and their apices backwards and inwards, so that the axes of the two, if continued backwards, would meet over the body of the sphenoid bone. Each orbit is formed of seven bones, the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, malar, lachrymal, and palate; but three of these, the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid, enter into the formation of botJi orbits, so that the two cavities are formed of eleven bones only. Each cavity presents for examination a roof, a floor, an inner and an outer wall, four angles, a circumference or base, and an apex. The roof is concave, directed downwards and forwards, and formed in front by the orbital plate of the frontal; behind by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. This surface presents internally the depression for the cartilaginous pulley of the Superior oblique muscle ; externally, the depression for the lachrymal gland ; and posteriorly, the suture connecting the frontal and lesser wing of the sphenoid.

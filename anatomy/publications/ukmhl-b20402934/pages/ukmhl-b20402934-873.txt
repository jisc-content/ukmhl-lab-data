OEGANS OF SENSE THE Organs of the Senses are five in number : viz. those of Touch, of Taste, of Smell, of Hearing, and of Sight. The skin, which is the principal seat of the sense of touch, has been described in the chapter on General Anatomy. THE TONGUE The Tongue is the organ of the special sense of taste. It is situated in the floor of the mouth, in the interval between the two lateral portions of the body of the lower jaw. Its base, or root, is directed backwards, and connected with the os hyoides by the Hyo-glossi and Genio-hyo-glossi muscles and the hyo-giossal membrane ; with Fig. 476.â€”Upper surface of the tongue. the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane, which form the glosso-epiglottic, ligaments ; with the soft palate by means of the anterior pillars of the fauces and with the pharynx by the Superior constrictor and the mucous membrane. Its apex, or tip, thin and narrow, is directed forwards against the inner surface of the lower incisor teeth. The under surface of the tongue is connected with the lower jaw by the Genio-hyo-glossi muscles; from its sides, the mucous membrane is reflected to the inner surface of the gums ; and, in front, a distinct fold of that membrane, the frcBnum lingucB, is formed beneath its under surface. The tip of the tongue, part of the under surf ace, its sides, and dorsum, are fr ee. The dorsum of the tongue is convex, marked along the middle line by a raphe.

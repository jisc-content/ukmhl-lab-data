OF THE PELVIS the lateral surface of the base of the sacrum, becoming blended with the anterior sacro-iliac ligament. This ligament is in relation, in front, with.the Psoas muscle. The Ilio-lumbar Ligament (fig. 239) passes horizontally outwards from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium immediately in front of the sacro-iliac articulation. It is of a triangular form, thick and narrow internally, broad and thinner externally. It is in relation, in front, with the Psoas muscle; behind, with the muscles occupying the vertebral groove ; above, with the Quadratus lumborum. X. Articulations of the Pelvis The ligaments connecting the bones of the pelvis with each other may be divided into four groups : i. Those connecting the sacrum and ilium. 2.

Aeticulations of the Sacrum and Ilium The sacro-iliac articulation is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed between the lateral surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. The anterior or auricular portion of each articular surface is covered with a thin plate of cartilage, thicker on the sacrum than on the ilium. The surfaces of these cartilages in the adult are rough and irregular, and separated from one another by a soft, yellow, pulpy substance. At an early period of life, occasionally in the adult, and in the female during pregnancy, they are smooth, and lined by a delicate synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting these surfaces are the anterior and posterior sacro-iliac.

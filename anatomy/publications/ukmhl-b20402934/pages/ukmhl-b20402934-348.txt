Externally, it is covered by the parotid gland, and by the integument. In- ternally, it is in relation with the capsular ligament of which it is an accessory band, and not separable from it. The Internal Lateral Liga- ment (fig. 233) is a specialised band of cervical fascia which is attached above to the spinous ]3rocess of the sphenoid bone, and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the lingula and margin of the dental foramen. Its outer surface is in relation, above, with the External pterygoid muscle ; lower down, it is separated from the neck of the condyle by the internal maxillary artery ; and still more inferiorly, the inferior dental vessels and nerve separate it from the ramus of the jaw. The inner surface is in relation with the Internal pterygoid.

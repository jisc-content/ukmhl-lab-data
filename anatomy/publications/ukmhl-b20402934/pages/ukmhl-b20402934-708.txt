VEINS 66o Galen), larger than the rest, runs along the right border of the heart. They open separately into the lower part of the right auricle. The Right or Small Coronary Sinus runs along the groove between the right auricle and ventricle, to open into the right extremity of the great coronary sinus. It receives blood from the back part of the right auricle and ventricle. The Left or Great Coronary Sinus is that portion of the anterior cardiac vein which is situated in the posterior part of the left auriculo-ventricular groove. It is about an inch in length, presents a considerable dilatation, and is covered by the muscular fibres of the left auricle. It receives the veins enumerated above, and an oblique vein from the back part of the left auricle, the remnant of the obliterated left innominate trunk of the foetus, described by Mr. Marshall. The great coronary sinus terminates in the right auricle, between the inferior vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular aperture, its orifice being guarded by a semilunar fold of the lining membrane of the heart, the coronary valve. All the veins joining this vessel, excepting the oblique vein above mentioned, are provided with valves. The Vense Thebesii are numerous minute veins, which return the blood directly from the muscular substance, without entering the venous current. They open by minute orifices {foramina Thebesii) on the inner surface of the right auricle.

CRANIAL NERVES 738 Its apparent origin is from the inner surface of the crus cerebri, immediately in front of the pons Varohi. The deep oricjm may be traced through the Fig. 440.—Nerves of the orbit. Seen from above. Infratrochleai' nerve locus niger and tegmentum of the crus to a nucleus situated on either side of the median line beneath the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius. On emerging from the brain, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It then pierces the dura mater in front of and external to the posterior clinoid process, pas- sing between the two processes from the free and attached borders of the tentorium, which are prolonged forwards to be connected with the an- terior and posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. It passes along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves, re- ceiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. It then divides into two branches, which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the External rectus muscle. On passing through the fissure, the nerve is placed below the fourth and the frontal and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic nerve, and has passing between its two divisions the nasal nerve.

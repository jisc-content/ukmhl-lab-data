136 THE SKELETON it is directed downwards, outwards, and forwards, and transmits the hypoglossal nerve, and occasionally a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery. This foramen is sometimes double. Behind each condyle is a fossa,* sometimes perforated at the bottom by a foramen, the posterior condyloid, for the transmis- sion of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the foramen magnum is a strong quadrilateral plate of bone, the basilar process, wider behind than in front; its under surface, which is rough, presenting in the median line a tubercular ridge, the pharyngeal spine, for the attachment of the tendinous raphe and Superior constrictor of the pharynx ; and, on each side of it, rough depressions for the attachment of the Kectus capitis anticus, major and minor. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 131) is deeply concave. The posterior Fig. 131.â€”Occipital bone. Imier"surface. Superior angle or occipital part is divided by a crucial ridge into four fossae. The two superior fossaB receive the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, and present slight eminences and depressions corresponding to their convolutions. The two inferior, which receive the hemispheres of the cerebellum, are larger than the former, and com- paratively smooth ; both are marked by slight grooves for the lodgment of arteries. At the point of meeting of the four divisions of the crucial ridge is an eminence, the internal occipital protuberance. It nearly corresponds to that on the outer i * This fossa presents many variations in size. It is usually shallow, and the foramen j small; occasionally wanting on one or both sides. Sometimes both fossa and foramen are large, but confined to one side only ; more rarely, the fossa and foramen are very large on both sides.

SYMPATHETIC NEKVE 822 joins with the dorsal branch of the loudic nerve, and is distributed to the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum. The vaginal plexus arises from the lower part of the pelvic plexus. It is lost on the walls of the vagina, being distributed to the erectile tissue at its anterior part and to the mucous membrane. The nerves composing this plexus contain, like the vesical, a large proportion of spinal nerve-fibres. The uterine plexus arises from the upper part of the pelvic plexus, above the point where the branches from the sacral nerves join the plexus. Its branches accompany the uterine arteries to the side of the organ between the layers of the broad ligament, and are distributed to the cervix and lower part of the body of the uterus, penetrating its substance. Other filaments pass separately to the body of the uterus and Fallopian tube. Branches from the plexus accompany the uterine arteries into the substance of the uterus. Upon these filaments ganglionic enlargements are found.

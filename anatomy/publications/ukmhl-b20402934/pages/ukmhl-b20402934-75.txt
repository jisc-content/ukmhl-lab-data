29 BONE first stage of ossification, two processes going on simultaneously: in the centre of the cartilage the formation of a number of oblong spaces, formed of calcified matrix and containing the cartilage-cells enlarged and arranged in groups, and on the surface of the cartilage the formation of a layer of true membrane-bone. The second stage consists in the prolongation into the cartilage of processes of the deeper or osteogenetic layer of the periosteum (fig. 32, ir). The processes consist of blood-vessels and cells (osteoblasts). They excavate passages through the new- formed bony layer by absorption, and pass through it into the calcified matrix (fig. 32). Wherever these processes come in contact with the calcified walls of the YiQ. 32.—Section of foetal bone of cat. Fig. 33.—Part of a longitudinal section of the developing femur of a rabbit. if.

In these secondary spaces the original cartilage-cells disappear, and their cavities become filled with embryonic marrow, consisting of osteoblasts and vessels, and derived, at all events in part, in the manner described above, from the osteogenetic layer of the periosteum (fig. 33). What becomes of the cartilage-cells is not finally determined. By most histologists they are believed to be converted, after division, into osteoblasts, and so assist in forming the embryonic marrow. Others, on the other hand, believe that they are simply absorbed and take no part in the formation of bone. Thus far, then, we have got enlarged spaces (secondary areolae), the walls of

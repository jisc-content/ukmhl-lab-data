TWELFTH. HYPOGLOSSAL 769 The muscular branches are distributed to the Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio-hyoid, and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. At the under surface of the tongue, numerous slender branches pass upwards into the substance of the organ to supply its muscular structure. Surgical Anatomy.—The hypoglossal nerve is an important guide in the operation of ligature of the lingual artery (see page 534). It runs forwards just above the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and forms the upper boundary of the triangular space in which the artery is to be sought for. Fig. 455.—Hypoglossal nerve, cervical plexus, and their branches. THE SPINAL NEEVES The spinal nerves are so called because they take their origin from the spinal cord, and are transmitted through the intervertebral foramina on either side of the spinal column. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, which are arranged into the following groups, corresponding to the region of the spine through which they pass:— Cervical 8 pairs.

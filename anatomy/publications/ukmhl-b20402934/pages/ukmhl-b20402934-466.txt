MUSCLES AND FASCIA 420 The Triangularis sterni is a thin plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest. It arises from the lower part of the side of the sternum, from the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage, and from the sternal ends of the costal cartilages of the three or four lower true ribs. Its fibres diverge upwards and outwards, to be inserted by fleshy digitations into the lower border and inner surfaces of the costal cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. The lowest fibres of this muscle are horizontal in their direction, and are continuous with those of the Transversalis; those Avhich succeed are oblique, whilst the superior fibres are almost vertical.

SCALENUS MEDIUS I varies much in its attachment, not only in different bodies, but on opposite sides of the same body. Relations.—In front, with the sternum, ensiform cartilage, costal cartilages. Internal intercostal muscles, and internal mammary vessels. Behind, with the pleura, pericardium, and anterior mediastinum. The Levatores Costarum (fig. 288), twelve in number on each side, are small tendinous and fleshy bundles, which arise from the extremities of the transverse processes of the seventh cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae, and, passing obliquely downwards and outwards, are inserted into the upper border of the rib below them, between the tubercle and the angle.

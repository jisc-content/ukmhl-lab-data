THE BLADDER 1007 THE PELVIS The cavity of the pelvis is that part of the general abdominal cavity which is below the level of the linea ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. Boundaries.—It is bounded, behind, by the sacrum, the coccyx, the Pyriformis muscle, and the great sacro-sciatic ligaments ; in front and at the sides, by the ossa pubis and ischia, covered by the Obturator muscles ; above, it communicates with the cavity of the abdomen ; and below, the outlet is closed by the triangular ligament, the Levatores ani and Coccygei muscles, and the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which is reflected from the wall of the pelvis on to the viscera. Contents.—The viscera contained in this cavity are the urinary bladder, the rectum, and some of the generative organs peculiar to each sex, and some convo- lutions of the small intestines : they are partially covered by the peritoneum, and supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The Bladdek The bladder is the reservoir for the urine. It is a musculo-membranous sac, situated in the pelvis, behind the pubes, and in front of the rectum in the male, Fig. 599.—Vertical section of bladder, penis, and urethra. the uterus and vagina intervening between it and that intestine in the female. The shape, position, and relations of the bladder are greatly influenced by age, sex, and the degree of distension of the organ. During infancy it is conical in shape, and projects above the upper border of the os pubis into the hypogastric region. In the adult, when quite empty and contracted, it is a small triangular sac, placed deeply in the pelvis, flattened from before backwards, its apex reaching

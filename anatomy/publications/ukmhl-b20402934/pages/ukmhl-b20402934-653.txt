605 INTERNAL PUDIC The external branch curves round the outer margm of the foramen, to the space between the Gemelkis inferior and Quadratus femoris, where it anastomoses with the sciatic artery. It supplies the Obturator muscles, anastomoses, as it passes backwards, with the internal branch and with the internal circumflex, and Fig. 373.—Variations in origin and course of obturator artery. sends a branch to the hip-joint through the cotyloid notch, which ramifies on the round ligament as far as the head of the femur. Peculiarities.—In two out of every three cases the obturator arises from the internal iliac; in one case in 3^ from the epigastric; and in about one in sevent^^-two cases by two roots from both vessels. It arises in about the same proportion from the external iliac artery. The origin of the obturator from the epigastric is not commonly found on both sides of the same body. When the obturator artery arises at the front of the pelvis from the epigastric, it descends almost vertically to the upper part of the obturator foramen. The artery in this course usually lies in contact with the external iliac vein, and on the outer side of the femoral ring (fig. 373, a) ; in such cases it would not be endangered in the operation for femoral hernia. Occasionally, however, it curves inwards along the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 373, B),and under such circumstances would almost completely encircle the neck of a hernial sac (supposing a hernia to exist in such a case), and would be in great danger of being wounded if an operation was performed. Fig. 374.—The internal pudic arter}^ and its branches in the male. The Internal Pudic is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, and supplies the external organs of generation. Though the course of the artery is the same in the two sexes, the vessel is much smaller in the female than in the male, and the distribution of its branches

THE BLADDEE 009 toneum, becoming thinner as it ascends. On each side of it is placed a fibrous cord, the obliterated portion of the hypogastric artery, which, passing upwards from the side of the bladder, approaches the urachus above its summit. In the infant, at birth, it is occasionally found pervious, so that the urine escapes at the umbilicus, and calculi have been found in its canal. The body of the bladder is not covered in front by peritoneum, but is in relation with the triangular ligament, the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis, the Internal obturator muscles, and, when distended, with the abdominal parietes. The posterior surface is covered by peritoneum. It corresponds, in the male, with the rectum; in the female, with the uterus, some convolutions of the small intestine being interposed.

(Henle.) \rsal )tum The side of the bladder is crossed obliquely from below, upwards and forwards, by the obliterated hypogastric artery: above and behind this cord the bladder is covered by peritoneum ; but below and in front of it the serous covering is wanting, and it is connected to the pelvic fascia. The vas deferens passes, in an arched direction, from before backwards, along the side of the bladder, towards its base, crossing in its course the obliterated hypogastric artery, and passing along the inner side of the ureter. The base (fundus) of the bladder is directed downwards and backwards. It varies in extent according to the state of distension of the organ, being very broad when full, but much narrower when empty. In the male, it rests upon the second portion of the rectum, from which it is separated by a reflection of the recto-vesical 3T

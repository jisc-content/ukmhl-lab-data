SUPEEIOR MESENTERIC 595 aorta, about a quarter of an inch below the coeliac axis ; being covered at its origin by the splenic vein and pancreas. It passes forwards, between the pancreas and transverse portion of the duodenum, crosses in front of this portion of the intestine, and descends between the layers of the mesentery to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates, considerably diminished in size. In its course it forms an arch, the convexity of which is directed forwards and downwards to the left side, the concavity backwards and upwards to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein, and is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are, the Inferior Pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic. Vasa Intestini Tenuis. Colica Dextra. Colica Media. The Inferior pancreatico-duodenal is given off from the superior mesenteric behind the pancreas, and is distributed to the head of the pancreas, with the transverse and descending portions of the duodenum; anastomosing with the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery. The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are distributed to the jejunum and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery ; each vessel dividing into two branches, which unite with a Q Q 2

The subsequent changes which take place in these ves- sels are the following : The communicating branch be- tween the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left in- nominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is obli- terated as far as the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coronary sinus: a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial fold of the peri- cardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corre- sponding with those de- rived from it. The tAvo veins of each side unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innomi- nate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four, in number, arise in the venous plexus on the thyroid body, commu- nicating with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, be- hind the Sterno-thyroid muscle, communicating with its fellow by trans- verse branches, and termi- nates in the left innomi- nate vein. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right innominate vein, just at its junction with the su- perior vena cava. These veins receive oesophageal, tracheal, and inferior laryngeal veins, and are provided with valves at their termin- ation in the innominate veins. The Superior Intercostal Veins return the blood from the upper intercostal spaces. Suprarenal

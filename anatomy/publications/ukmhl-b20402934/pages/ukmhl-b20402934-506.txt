460 MUSCLES AND FASCIA YiG, 307.—Front of the left forearm. Deep mnscles. the two tendons together, after the deep tendons have passed through ; and a thh^d con- nects the deep tendon to the head of the second phalanx. This last consists largely of yellow elastic tissue, and may assist in drawing down the tendon after flexion of the finger.* Four small muscles, the Lumbricales, are connected with the tendons of the Flexor profundus in the palm They mil be described with the muscles in that region. Relations.—By its sujjer- ficial surface, in the forearm, with the Flexor sublimis digi- torum, the Flexor carpi ulna- ris, the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the median nerve ; and in the hand, with the tendons of the superficial Flexor. By its deei^ surface, in the forearm, with the ulna, the interosseous membrane, the Pronator quadratus ; and in the hand, with the inter- ossei. Adductor pollicis, and deep palmar arch. By its ulnar border, with the Flexor carpi ulnaris. By its radial border, with the Flexor longus pollicis, the anterior inter- osseous vessels and nerve being interposed. The Flexor longus pollicis is situated on the radial side of the forearm, lying on the same plane as the preceding. It arises from the grooved anterior surface of the shaft of the radius : commencing, above, immediately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and extending, below, to within a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and generally by a fleshy slip from the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards, and terminate in * Marshall, Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., 1853.

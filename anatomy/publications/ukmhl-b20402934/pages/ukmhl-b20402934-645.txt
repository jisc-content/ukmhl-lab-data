597 INFEEIOR MESENTERIC course, the ureter, and left common iliac vessels. It divides into two branches, which descend one on each side of the rectum, and about five inches from the anus break up into several small branches, which are distributed between the mucous and muscular coats of that tube, nearly as far as its lower end ; anastomosing with each other, with the middle haemorrhoidal arteries, branches of the internal iliac, and with the inferior haemorrhoidal branches of the internal pudic. The Suprarenal Arteries (fig. 367) are two small vessels which arise, one on each side of the aorta, opposite the superior mesenteric artery. They pass obliquely upwards and outwards, over the crura of the Diaphragm, to the under surface of the suprarenal capsules, to which they are distributed, anastomosing with capsular Fig. 371.â€”The inferior mesenteric and its branches. branches from the phrenic and renal arteries. In the adult these arteries are of small size; in the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. The Renal Arteries are two large trunks, which arise from the sides of the aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is directed outwards, across the crus of the Diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The right is longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta; it passes behind the inferior vena cava. The left is somewhat higher than the right. Previously to entering the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches which are distributed to its substance. At the hilum, these branches lie between the renal vein and ureter, the vein being usually in front, the ureter behind. Each vessel gives off some small branches to the suprarenal

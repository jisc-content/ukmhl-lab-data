790 SPINAL NERVES Fig. 463.â€”Superficial and deep distribution of the posterior branches of the spinal nerves (after Hhschfeld and Leveille). On the left side the cutaneous branches are represented lying on the superficial layer of muscles. On the right side the superficial muscles have been removed, the Splenius capitis and Complexus divided in the neck, and the Erector spinffi divided and partly removed in the back, so as to expose the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves near their origin. a a. Lesser occipital uerve from the cervical plexus. 1. External muscular branches of the first cervical uerve, and union by a loop with the second. 2. Placed on the Rectus capitis posticus major muscle, marks the great occipital nerve, passing round the short muscles and piercing the Complexus : the external branch is seen to the outside. 3. External branch from the posterior division of the third nerve. 3'. Its internal branch, sometimes called the third occipital. 4' to 8'. The internal branches of the several corresponding nei^es on the left side. The external branches of these nerves, proceeding to muscles, are displayed on the right side, d 1 to d 6 and thence to 12. External muscular branches of the posterior divisions of the 12 dorsal nerves on the right side, d' 1 to d6'. The internal cutaneous branches of the six upper dorsal nerves on the left side, d f to d 12'. Cutaneous twigs from the external branches of the six lower dorsal nerves. I I. External branches from the posterior divisions of several lumbar nerves on the right side, piercing the muscles, the lower descending over the gluteal region. I' V. The same, more superficially, on the left side, s s. The issue and union by loops of the posterior divisions of four sacral nerves on the right side, s's'. Some of those distributed to the skin on the left side.

Fig. 449.—Plan of the facial nerve. (After Flower.) The tympanic branch arises from the nerve opposite the pyramid ; it passes through a small canal vn the pyramid, and supplies the Stapedius muscle. The chorda tympani is given off from the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of the tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It passes from below upwards and forwards in a distinct canal, and enters the cavity of the tympanum, through an aperture (iter chordcB loosterkis) on its posterior wall between the opening of the mastoid cells and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner end of the Glaserian fissure, which is called the iter cJiordce anterius, or canal of Huguier. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, meets the lingual nerve at an acute angle, and accompanies it to the submaxillary gland; part of it then joins the submaxillary ganglion; the rest is continued onwards into the proper

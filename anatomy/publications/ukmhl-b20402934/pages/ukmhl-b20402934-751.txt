CONVOLUTIONS OF CEREBRUM 701 temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and above with the parietal. It is divided on the outer surface of the hemisphere into three convolutions by two indistinct sulci, the superior and middle occipital sulci. They are directed backwards across the lobe, being frequently small and ill-marked ; the superior is sometimes continuous with the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus. The superior occipital convolution is situated above the superior sulcus, and is connected to the superior parietal convolution by the _^7'5^ annectant ggrus. The middle occipital convolution is situated between the superior and middle occipital sulci, and is connected to the angular convolution by the second annectant gyrus, and to the middle temporo-sphenoidal by the third annectant gyrus. The inferior occipital convolution is situated below the middle occipital sulcus, and is sometimes separated from the external occipito-temporal convolution on the under surface of the hemisphere by an inconstant sulcus, the inferior occipital Fig. 417.â€”Convolutions and fissures of the under surface of the anterior lobe. sulcus. It is connected to the inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution by the fourth annectant gyrtis. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe is that portion of the hemisphere which is lodged in the middle fossa of the base of the skull. In front and above, it is limited by the fissure of Sylvius ; behind, it is connected with the parietal and occipital lobes, and is limited artificially by a line continuing the direction of the external parieto- occipital fissure across the outer surface of the hemisphere. It is divided into three convolutions by two sulci. The superior of these runs parallel to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named the superior temporo- sphenoidal or parallel sulcus, and is well marked and constant. The second, the middle temporo-sp)henoidal, is not so well marked or constant ; it takes the same course at a lower level.

899 THE PEEITONEUM The Peritoneum The peritoneum (TreptTetVetj/, to extend around) is a serous membrane, and partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. In consequence of the number and different shapes of these viscera, the reflections of the peritoneum, as it invests them, are exceedingly complex and difficult to understand. The peritoneum partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and pelvic cavities, forming the visceral layer of the membrane ; it is then reflected upon the internal surface of the parietes of those cavities, forming the parietal layer. The free surface of the peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a layer of flattened endothelial cells ; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the parietes by means of areolar tissue called the subserous areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to get a flrst general idea of the peritoneum and its reflections, the student should bear in mind that all the abdominal and pelvic viscera are placed external to it, and that it is a shut sac superimposed upon the viscera.* Let the student imagine that all the viscera are in their proper positions in the abdominal cavity, but uninvested by peritoneum. Upon the top of them is placed a large closed sac, the walls of which are of extreme thinness, and wherever * We may disregard, for the present, the fact that the peritoneum in the female is not an absolutely closed sac, since the Fallopian tubes open into it at their free extremities. 3 M 2 Fig. 523.â€”The reflections of the peritoneum, as seen in a vertical section of the abdomen. - Lesser omentum Passes through foramen of Winslow

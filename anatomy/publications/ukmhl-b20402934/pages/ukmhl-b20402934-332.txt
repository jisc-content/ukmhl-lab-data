286 THE SKELETON opposite the same joints of the third and fourth fingers. In the lower extremity, the patella, which is developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor ; two small sesamoid bones, found in the tendons of the Flexor brevis hallucis, opposite the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe ; and occasionally one in the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the second toe, the little toe, and, still more rarely, the third and fourth toes. Those found in the tendons which glide over certain bones occupy the following situations : one sometimes found in the tendon of the Biceps cubiti, opposite the tuberosity of the radius ; one in the tendon of the Peroneus longus, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone ; one appears late in life in the tendon of the Tibialis anticus, opposite the smooth facet of the internal cuneiform bone ; one is found in the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, opposite the inner side of the head of the astragalus ; one in the outer head of the Gastrocnemius, behind the outer condyle of the femur; and one in the conjoined tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus, where it glides over the os pubis. Sesamoid bones are found occasionally in the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, as it passes over the great trochanter; and in the tendons which wind round the inner and outer malleoli.

THE THORAX 958 forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. %The following parts present themselves for examination :— The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectinati. The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side (see note, page 956). Fig. 564.—The left auricle and ventricle laid open, the posterior walls of both bemg removed. The musculi pectinati are fewer in number and smaller than on the right side ; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum auricularum may be seen a lunated impression, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned upwards. The depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. To exannne the interior of the left ventricle, make an incision a little to the left of the anterior interventricular groove from the base to the apex of the heart, and carry it up from thence a little to the left of the posterior interventricular groove, nearly as far as the auriculo-ventricular groove. The Left Ventricle is longer and more conical in shape than the right ventricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the heart by its projection beyond the right ventricle. Its walls are much thicker than those of the right side, the proportion being as 3 to i. They are also thickest in the broadest part of the ventricle, becoming gradually thinner towards the base, and also towards the apex, which is the thinnest part.

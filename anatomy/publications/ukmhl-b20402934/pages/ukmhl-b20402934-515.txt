OF THE HAND 469 ments for the passage of tendons, each of which is lined by a separate synovial membrane. These are, from without inwards:—i. On the outer side of the styloid process, for the tendons of the Extensor ossis metacarpi and Extensor brevis pollicis. 2. Behind the styloid process, for the tendons of the Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. 3. About the middle of the posterior surface of the radius, for the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis. 4. To the inner side of the latter, for the tendons of the Extensor communis digitorum and Extensor indicis. 5. Opposite the interval between the radius and ulna, for the Extensor minimi digiti. 6. Grooving the back of the ulna, for the tendon of Fig. 314.—Palmar fascia. (Altered from a dissection in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England.) the Extensor carpi ulnaris. The synovial membranes lining these sheaths are usually very extensive, reaching from above the annular ligament, down upon the tendons for a variable distance on the back of the hand. The deep palmar fascia (fig. 314) forms a common sheath which invests the muscles of the hand. It consists of a central and two lateral portions. The central portion occupies the middle of the palm, is triangular in shape, of great strength and thickness, and binds down the tendons in this situation. It is narrow above, being attached to the lower margin of the annular ligament, and receives the expanded tendon of the Palmaris longus muscle. Below, it is broad and expanded, and divides into four slips, for the four fingers. Each slip gives off

951 THE PERICARDIUM in a cPBcal extremity. Below, the fibrous layer is attached to the central tendon of the Diaphragm ; and, on the left side, to its muscular fibres. The vessels receiving fibrous prolongations from this membrane are, the aorta, the superior vena cava, the right and left pulmonary arteries, and the four pulmonary veins. As the inferior vena cava enters the pericardium through the central tendon of the Diaphragm, it receives no covering from the fibrous layer. The seroiis layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium. It consists, therefore, of a visceral and parietal portion. The Fig. 561.—Pericardium, from behind.

I/. former invests the surface of the heart, and the commencement of the great vessels, to the extent of two inches from their origin; from these it is reflected upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer, lining, below, the upper surface of the central tendon of the Diaphragm. The serous membrane encloses the aorta and pulmonary artery in a single tube ; but it only partially covers the superior and inferior vena cava and the four pulmonary veins. Its inner surface is smooth and glistening, and secretes a thin fluid, which serves to facilitate the movements of the heart. Arteries of the pericardium.—These are derived from the internal mammary, and its musculo-phrenic branch, and from the descending thoracic aorta. 'Nerves of the pericardium.—These are branches from the vagus, the phrenic and the sympathetic.

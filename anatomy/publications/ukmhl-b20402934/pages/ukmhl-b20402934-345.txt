299 OF THE ATLAS WITH THE OCCIPITAL BONE Actions.—This joint allows the rotation of the atlas (and, with it, of the cranium) upon the axis, the extent of rotation being limited by the odontoid ligaments. The principal muscles by which this action is produced are the Sterno- mastoid and Complexus of one side, acting with the Eectus capitis anticus major, Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, Rectus capitis posticus major, and Inferior oblique of the other side. Articulations of the Spine with the Cranium The ligaments connecting the spine with the cranium may be divided into two sets, those connecting the occipital bone with the atlas, and those connecting the occipital bone with the axis. III. Articulation of the Atlas with the Occipital Bone This articulation is a double condyloid joint. Its ligaments are, the Two Anterior Occipito-atlantal. Two Lateral Occipito-atlantal. Posterior Occipito-atlantal. Two Capsular. Of the Two Anterior Occipito-atlantal Ligaments (fig. 228), the superficial is a strong, narrow, rounded cord, attached, above, to the basilar process of the Fig. 229.—Occipito-atloid and atlo-axoid ligaments. Posterior view. occiput; below, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas : the deeper hgament is a broad and thin membranous layer which passes between the anterior margin of the foramen magnum above, and the whole length of the upper border of the anterior arch of the atlas below. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the Recti antici minores ; behind, with the odontoid ligaments. The Posterior Occipito-atlantal Ligament (fig. 229) is a very broad but thin membranous lamina, intimately blended with the dura mater. It is connected, above, to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum ; below, to the upper border of the posterior arch of the atlas. This ligament is incomplete at each side, and

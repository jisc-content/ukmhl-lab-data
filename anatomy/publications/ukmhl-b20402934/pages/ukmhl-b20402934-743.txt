693 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY OF MEDULLA 2, Some are longitudinal; these are derived from the arciform fibres, which on entering the raphe change their direction and become longitudinal. 3. Some are oblique ; these are continuous with the deep arciform fibres which pass from the raphe. Some of the fibres of the raphe arise from the nuclei on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The formatio reticularis.—In the substance of the medulla behind the pyramid and olivary body is a peculiar reticulated structure, which has received the name of formatio reticularis ; the appearance it presents in sections of the medulla is due to its being composed of bundles of fibres running at right angles to each other, some being longitudinal, others transverse. Fig. 413.— Section of the medulla oblongata at about the middle of the olivary bod^y. (Schwalbe.) Anterior iiiedian fissure The longitudinal fibres are derived— 1. From the anterior column of the cord after the direct pyramidal tract has passed into the pyramid. 2. From the olivary body. 3. From the lateral column of the cord after the crossed pyramidal tract has passed into the pyramid. 4. From the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis. The transverse fibres are the deep arciform fibres. In the lateral part of this reticular structure grey matter containing large nerve-cells is found. The Grey Matter of the Medulla oblongata.—The grey matter of the medulla oblongata is partly continuous with the grey matter of the cord, and partly arranged in independent masses. It contains many multipolar ganglion-cells. In the lower part of the medulla, the grey matter, which is continuous with that of the cord, is arranged in the shape of two crescentic horns with their convexities towards each other and connected by a central commissure; but in the upper part

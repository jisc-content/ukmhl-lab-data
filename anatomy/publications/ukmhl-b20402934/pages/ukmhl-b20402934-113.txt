67 SECRETING GLANDS co7npound tubular. The racemose gland in its simplest form consists of a primary involution which forms a sort of cluct, upon the extremity of which are found a number of secondary involutions, called saccules or alveoli, as in Brunner's glands (fig. 71, d). But, again, in other instances, the duct, instead of being simple, may divide into branches, and these again into other branches, and so on ; each ultimate ramification terminating in a dilated cluster of saccules, and thus we may have the secreting surface almost indefinitely extended, as in the salivary glands (fig. 71, e). In the compound Utbular glands the division of the primary duct takes place in the same way as in the racemose glands, but the branches retain their tubular form, and do not terminate in saccular recesses, but become greatly lengthened out (fig. 71, f). The best examples of this form of gland are to be found in the kidney and testicle. All these varieties of glands are produced by a more or less compli- cated involution of a secreting membrane, and they are all identical in structure ; that is to say, the saccules or tubes, as the case may be, are lined with cells, generally spheroidal or columnar in figure, and on their outer surface is an intimate plexus of capillary vessels. The secretion, whatever it may be, is eliminated by the cells from the blood, and is poured into the saccule or tube, and so finds its way out through the primary involution on to the free surface of the secreting mem- brane. In addition, however, to these glands, which are formed by an involution of the secreting membrane, there are some few others which are formed by a protrusion of the same structure, as in the vascular fringes of synovial membranes. This form of secreting structure is not nearly so frequently met with. F 2

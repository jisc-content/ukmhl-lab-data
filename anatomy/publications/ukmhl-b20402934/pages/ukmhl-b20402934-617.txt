AXILLA 569 Serratus magnus. On the outer side, where the anterior and posterior boundaries converge, the space is narrow, and bounded by the humerus, the Coraco-brachahs and Biceps muscles. Contents.—This space contains the axillary vessels, and brachial plexus of nerves, with their branches, some branches of the intercostal nerves, and a large number of lymphatic glands, all connected together by a quantity of fat and loose areolar tissue. Their Position.—The axillary artery and vein, with the brachial plexus of nerves, extend obliquely along the outer boundary of the axillary space, from its apex to its base, and are placed much nearer the anterior than the posterior wall, the vein lying to the inner or thoracic side of the artery, and partially concealing it. At the fore part of the axillary space, in contact with the Pectoral muscles, are the thoracic branches of the axillary artery, and along the anterior margin of the axilla Fig. 362.—The axillary arterj^ and its branches. the long thoracic artery extends to the side of the chest. At the back part, in contact with the lower margin of the Subscapularis muscle, are the subscapular vessels and nerves ; winding around the lower border of this muscle is the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins ; and towards the outer extremity of the muscle, the posterior circumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve are seen curving backwards to the shoulder. Along the inner or thoracic side no vessel of any importance exists, the upper part of the space being crossed merely by a few small branches from the superior thoracic artery. There are some important nerves, however, in this situation, viz. the posterior thoracic or external respiratory nerve, descending on the surface of the Serratus magnus, to which it is distributed ; and perforating the upper and anterior part of this wall, the intercosto-humeral nerve or nerves, passing across the axilla to the inner side of the arm.

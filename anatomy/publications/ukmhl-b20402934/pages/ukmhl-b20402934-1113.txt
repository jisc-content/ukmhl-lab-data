1063 DEEP CEUEAL ARCH Crural Sheath.—The femoral or crural sheath is a continuation downwards of the fasciae that line the abdomen, the transversalis fascia passing down in front of the femoral vessels, and the iliac fascia descending behind them : these fasciae are directly continuous on the iliac side of the femoral artery, but a small space exists between the femoral vein and the point where they are continuous on the pubic side of that vessel, which constitutes the femoral or crural canal. The femoral sheath is closely adherent to the contained vessels about an inch below the saphenous opening, being blended with the areolar sheath of the vessels, but opposite Poupart's ligament it is much larger than is required to contain them; hence the funnel-shaped form which it presents. The outer border of the sheath is perforated by the genito-crural nerve. Its inner border is pierced by the internal Fig. 629.—Structures which pass beneath the crural arch. External Femoral artertj saphenous vein and numerous lymphatic vessels. In front, it is covered by the iliac portion of the fascia lata ; and behind it is the pubic portion of the same fascia. If the anterior wall of the sheath is removed, the femoral artery and vein are seen lying side by side, a thin septum separating the two vessels, while another septum may be seen lying just internal to the vein, and cutting off a small space between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath. The septar are stretched between the anterior and posterior walls of the sheath, so that each vessel is enclosed in a separate compartment. The interval left between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath is not filled up by any structure, excepting a little loose areolar tissue, a few lymphatic vessels, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland : this is the femoral or crural canal, through which the intestine descends in femoral hernia.

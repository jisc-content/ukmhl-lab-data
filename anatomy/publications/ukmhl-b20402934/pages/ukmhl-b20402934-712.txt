664 LYMPHATICS set accompany the temporal artery in front of the ear, to the parotid lymphatic glands, from which they proceed to the lymphatic glands of the neck. The occipital set follow the com^se of the occipital artery, descend to the occipital and posterior auricular lymphatic glands, and from thence join the cervical glands. The Lymphatic Vessels of the Face are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the face are more numerous than those of the head, and commence over its entire surface. Those from the frontal region accompany the frontal vessels ; they then pass obliquely across the face, running Fig. 395.â€”The superficial lymphatics and glands of the head, face, and neck. with the facial vein, pass through the buccal glands on the surface of the Bucci- nator muscle, and join the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The latter receive the lymphatic vessels from the lips, and are often found enlarged in cases of malignant disease of those parts. The deep lymphatic vessels of the face are derived from the pituitary membrane of the nose, the mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the contents of the temporal and orbital fossae ; they accompany the branches of the internal maxillary artery, and terminate m the internal maxillary and cervical lymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels of the cranium consist of two sets, the meningeal and cerebral. The meningeal lijmpliatics accompany the meningeal vessels, escape through foramina at the base of the skull, and join the deep cervical lymphatic

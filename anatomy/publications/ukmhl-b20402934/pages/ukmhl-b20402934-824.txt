SPINAL NEEVES 774 Antekioe Divisions of the Cervical Neeves The anterior division of the first or suboccipital nerve is of small size. It escapes from the spinal canal through a groove upon the posterior arch of the atlas. In this groove it lies beneath the vertebral artery, to the inner side of the Eectus capitis lateralis. As it crosses the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, it receives a filament from the sympathetic. It then descends, in front of this process, to communicate with an ascending branch from the second cervical nerve. Communicating filaments from this nerve join the pneumogastric, the hypo- glossal, and sympathetic, and some branches are distributed to the Eectus lateralis and the two Anterior recti. According to Valentin, the anterior division of the Fig. 457.â€”Plan of the cervical plexus. RECT. CAP . LAT. suboccipital also distributes filaments to the occipito-atlantal articulation, and mastoid process of the temporal bone. The anterior division of the second cervical nerve escapes from the spinal canal, between the posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis, and, passing forwards on the outer side of the vertebral artery, divides in front of the Intertransverse muscle, into an ascending branch, which joins the first cervical; and one or two descending branches which join the third. It gives off the small occipital; a branch to assist in forming the great auricular ; another to assist in forming the superficial cervical; one of the communicantes hypoglossi, and a lilament to the Sterno-mastoid, which communicates in the substance of the muscle with the spinal accessory. The anterior division of the third cervical nerve is double the size of the

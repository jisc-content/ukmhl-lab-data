c,i4 ORGANS OF DIGESTION the front of the right kidney ; at its inner side is the head of the pancreas, and the ductus communis choledochus. The common bile-duct and the pancreatic duct perforate the inner side of this portion of the intestine obhquely, a httle below its middle. The third, or transverse portion, the longest and narrowest part of the duo- denum, passes across the front of the spine, ascending from the third to the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the latter bone. In front, though at some distance from it, is the descending layer of the transverse meso-colon, or the divergence of the two layers of that structure, and it is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels ; behind, it rests upon the aorta, the vena cava inferior, and the crura of the Diaphragm; above it is the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vessels passing forwards between the two. The point of junction of the duodenum and jejunum is said to correspond to the spot where the gut receives a complete investment of peritoneum. From this point a fairly constant portion, about an inch in length, ascends on the left side of the vertebral column, and is by some regarded as a fourth part of the duodenum. This portion is fixed in this position by a band which extends upwards from it, obliquely across the aorta to the connective tissue around the coeliac axis and the

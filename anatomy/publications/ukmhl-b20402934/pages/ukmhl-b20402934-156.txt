GENEEAL ANATOMY no these parts are well developed by the second month, yet no distinction of sex is \ possible. I Female Organs (fig. io8, a, b, c).—The female organs are developed by an easy | transition from the above. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the I vagina, and forms a single tube with the upper part of the vagina, which, as we i have already seen, is developed from the united Miillerian ducts. The genital I tubercle forms the clitoris, the genital folds the labia majora, and the lips of the ' genital furrow the labia minora, which remain open. j Male Organs (fig. io8, a', b', c').—In the male the changes are greater. The ' genital tubercle is developed into the penis, the glans appearing in the third month, i the prepuce and corpora cavernosa in the fourth. The genital furrow closes and i thus forms a canal, the spongy portion of the urethra. The urogenital sinus! becomes elongated and forms the prostatic and membranous urethra. The genital' folds unite in the middle line to form the scrotum, at about the same time as the { genital furrow closes—viz. between the third and fourth month. | The following table is translated from the work of Beaunis and Bouchard, with i some alterations, especially in the earlier weeks. It will serve to present a resume; of the above facts in an easily accessible form.* * It will be noticed that the time assigned in this table for the appearance of the first rudiment of some of the bones varies in some cases from that assigned in the description of the various bones in the sequel. This is a point on which anatomists differ, and whichj probably varies in different cases. \

SUPERFICIAL FASCIA 1047 The superficial external pudic (suj^erior) artery arises from the inner side of the femoral artery, close to the preceding vessels, and, after passing through the saphenous opening, courses inwards, across the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudic. The superficial veins.—The veins accompanying these superficial vessels are usually much larger than the arteries: they terminate in the internal saphenous vein. The superficial inguinal lymphatic glands are placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups : an upper, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament. Fig. 621.—Inguinal hernia. Superficial dissection. which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietes of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions, and the mucous membrane of the urethra; and an inferior group, which surround the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, a few being sometimes continued along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. This latter group receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The deep layer of the superficial fascia ( fascia of Scarpa) is thinner and more membranous in character than the superficial layer. In the middle hne it is intimately adherent to the linea alba ; above, it is continuous with the superficial fascia over the rest of the trunk ; below, it blends with the fascia lata of the thigh, a little below Poupart's ligament; below and internally, in the male, it is continued over the penis and over the outer surface of the cord to the scrotum, where it helps

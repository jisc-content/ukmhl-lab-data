MUSCLES AND FASCL^^ 462 Fig. 308.—Posterior surface of the forearm. Superficial muscles. and from the external intermuscular septum, being limited above by the musculo-spiral groove. The fibres terminate above the middle of the forearm in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the outer side of the base of the styloid process of the radius. Relations.—By its suijerficial surface, with the integument and fascia for the greater part of its extent; near its insertion it is crossed by the Extensor ossis meta- carpi poUicis and the Extensor brevis pollicis. By its deep surface, with the humerus, the Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, the insertion of the Pronator radii teres, and the Supinator bre\ds. By its inner border, above the elbow, with the Brachialis anticus, the musculo-spiral nerve, and radial recurrent artery; and in the fore- arm, with the radial vessels and nerve. The Extensor carpi radialis longior is placed partly beneath the preceding muscle. It arises from the lower third of the external condyloid ridge of the humerus, and from the external intermuscu- lar septum. The fibres terminate at the upper third of the forearm in a flat tendon, which runs along the outer border of the radius, be- neath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; it then passes through a groove common to it and the Ex- tensor carpi radialis brevior, imme- diately behind the styloid process, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, on its radial side. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Supinator longus, and fascia of the forearm. Its outer side is crossed obliquely by the extensor tendons of the thumb. By its deep surface, with the elbow- joint, the Extensor carpi radialis brevior, and back part of the wrist. The Extensor carpi radialis brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the pre- ceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus, by a tendon

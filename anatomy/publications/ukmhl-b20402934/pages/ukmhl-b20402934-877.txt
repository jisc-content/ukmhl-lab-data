THE TONGUE 827 surrounded, by nodules of lymphoid tissue, similar to the structure found in the tonsil: into them open some of the ducts of the mucous glands. The fibrous septum consists of a vertical layer of fibrous tissue, extending throughout the entire length of the middle line of the tongue, from the base to the apex, though not quite reaching the dorsum. It is thicker behind than in front, and occasionally contains a small fibro-cartilage, about a quarter of an inch in length. It is well displayed by making a vertical section across the organ. The Hyo-glossal membrane is a strong fibrous lamina, which connects the under surface of the base of the tongue to the body of the hyoid bone. This membrane receives, in front, some of the fibres of the Genio-hyo-glossi. Vessels of the tongue.—The arteries of the tongue are derived from the lingual. Fig. 481.—Under surface of tongue, showing the distribution of nerves to this organ. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) the fascial, and ascending pharyngeal. The veins of the tongue accompany the arteries. Muscles of the tongue.—The muscular fibres of the tongue run in various directions. These fibres are divided into two sets, Extrinsic and Intrinsic. The 'Extrinsic muscles of the tongue are those which have their origin external to it, and only their terminal fibres contained in the substance of the organ. They are the Stylo-glossus, the Hyo-glossus, the Palato-glossus, the Genio-hyo-glossus, and part of the Superior constrictor of the pharynx (Pharyngo-glossus). The Intrinsic muscles are those which are contained entirely within the tongue, and form the greater part of its substance. Both sets have been already described (page 391). The lymphatic vessels from the tongue pass to one or two small glands situated

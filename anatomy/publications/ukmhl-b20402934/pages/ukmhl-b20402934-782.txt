External grey or cellular layer Corimscles of Pu rkinje -Internal or rust- coloured layer Wliite substance of the external grey or cellular layer, resting against the internal rust-coloured layer. From their under service a shght slender process arises, which passes through the internal layer, and becomes continuous with the axial cylinder of a meduUated nerve-fibre in the medullary substance beneath. From the other extremity two peripheral processes are given oft', which branch in an antler-like manner in the external layer, some of the finer processes becoming connected with the cells in this layer. The infernal or rust-coloured layer (fig. 436) is characterised by containing multitudes of granttlar-looking bodies embedded in a gelatinous matrix. They are minute stellate cells, consisting of a well-defined nucleus with a thin protoplasmic

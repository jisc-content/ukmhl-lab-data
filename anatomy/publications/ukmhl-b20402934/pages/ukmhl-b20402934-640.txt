The Coeliac Axis is a short thick trunk, about half an inch in length, ^vhich arises from the aorta, opposite the margin of the Diaphragm, and, passing nearly Fig. 368.—The coeliac axis and its branches, the liver having been raised, and the lesser omentum removed. Cystic artery horizontally forwards (in the erect posture), divides into three large branches, the gastric, liepatic, and splenic, occasionally giving off one of the phrenic arteries. Relations.—It is covered by the lesser omentum. On the right side, it is in relation with the right semilunar ganglion, and the lobus Spigelii; on the left side, with the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac end of the stomach. Beloiv, it rests upon the upper border of the pancreas. The Gastric Artery {Goronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes upwards and to the left side, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, distributing branches to the oesophagus which anastomose with the aortic oesophageal arteries; others supply the cardiac end of the stomach, inoscu- lating with branches of the splenic artery : it then passes from left to right, along

868 ORGANS OF SENSE an upper compartment, the scala vestihuli, and a lower one, the scala tymi)ani. By a second membrane a portion of the upper of these two canals is cut off from the rest, constituting the scala media. The lamina spiralis ends above in a hook- shaped process, which partly bounds the helicotrema. At the point where the osseous lamina is attached to the modiolus is a small canal, which winds round the modiolus, and was denominated by Rosenthal the caiialis spiralis modioli; it is occupied by a swelling of the cochlear nerve, the ganglion spirale, in which Fig. 505.—The cochlea laid open. (Enlarged.) ganglion-cells are found, and from which the nerves pass to the osseous lamina and organ of Corti. The osseous lamina, as above stated, extends only part of the distance between the modiolus and the outer bony wall of the cochlea. Near its outer end the periosteum on the upper or vestibular surface of the lamina swells up into an elevation which is called the limbus lamincB spiralis (' denticulate lamina ' of Todd and Bowman). The lamina spiralis terminates in a grooved extremity, the sulcus Fig. 506.—Longitudinal section of the cochlea, showing the relations of the scalse, the ganglion spirale, etc. S. V. Scala vestibuli.

Ganglion spirale. spiralis, which presents the form of the letter C : the upper part of the letter, being formed by the overhanging extremity of the limbus, is named the labium vestibulare; the lower part, prolonged and tapering, is called the labium tympani- cum (fig. 507). From the labium tympanicum a thin membrane extends over to the bony wall of the cochlea, completing the scala tympani. This membrane is called the viembrana basilar is. At its outer attachment it swells out so as to form a thick triangular structure, which was regarded as a muscle by Todd and Bowman

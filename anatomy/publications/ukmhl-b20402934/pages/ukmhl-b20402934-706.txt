VEINS 658 the artery, and terminates at its greater end by uniting at a right angle with the superior mesenteric to form the vena ported. The splenic vein is of large size, and not tortuous hke the artery. It receives the vasa brevia from the left extremity of the stomach, the,left gastro-epiploic vein, pancreatic branches from the pancreas, the pancreatico-duodenal vein, and the inferior mesenteric vein. The inferior mesenteric vein returns the blood from the rectum, sigmoid flexure, and descending colon, corresponding with the ramifications of the branches of Fig. 393.—Portal vein and its branches. j^OTE.—In this diagram the rio^ht gastro-epiploic vein opens into the splenic vein; generally it empties itself into the superior mesenteric, close to its termination. the inferior mesenteric artery. Ascending beneath the peritoneum in the lumbar region, it passes behind the transverse portion of the duodenum and pancreas, and termmates in the splenic vein. Its ha^morrhoidal branches inosculate with those of the internal ihac, and thus establish a communication between the portal and the general venous system.* * Besides this anastomosis between the portal vein and the branches of the vena cava, other anastomoses between the portal and systemic veins are formed by the commmiica-

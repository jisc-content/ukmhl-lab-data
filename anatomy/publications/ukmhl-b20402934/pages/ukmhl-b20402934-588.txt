540 AETERIES the face. At its origin, it is imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland, being on a level with the lower extremity of the lobule of the ear. In the first part of its course {maxillary ijortioii), the artery passes horizontally forwards and inwards, between the ramus of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament. The artery here lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve ; it crosses the inferior dental nerve, and lies along the lower border of the External pterygoid muscle. In the second part of its course [pterygoid portion), it runs obliquely forwards and upwards upon the outer surface of the External pterygoid muscle, being covered by the ramus of the lower jaw, and lower part of the Temporal muscle. In the third part of its course [splieno-maxillary ijortion), it approaches the Fig. 350.—The internal maxillary artery, and its branches. superior maxillary bone, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa in the interval between the two heads of the External pterygoid, where it Hes in relation with Meckel's ganglion, and gives off its terminal branches. Peculiarities—Oca&^iondlly, this artery passes between the two Pterygoid muscles. The vessel in this case passes forwards to the interval between the processes of origin of the External pterygoid, in order to reach the superior maxillary bone. Sometimes the vessel escapes from beneath the External pterygoid by perforating the middle of that muscle. The branches of this vessel may be divided into three groups, corresponding with its three divisions.

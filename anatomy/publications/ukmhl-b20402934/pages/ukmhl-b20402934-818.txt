768 CRANIAL NERVES to form one mass. It also communicates with the pharyngeal plexus by a minute filament as it winds round the occipital artery. The communication with the sympathetic takes place opposite the atlas by branches derived from the superior cervical ganglion, and in the same situation the nerve is joined by a filament derived from the loop connecting the first two cervical nerves. The communication with the lingual (gustatory) takes place near the anterior border of the Hyo-giossus muscle by numerous filaments which ascend upon it. The branches of distribution are, the Meningeal. Thyro-hyoid. Descendens hypoglossi. Muscular. Meningeal branches.â€”As the hypoglossal nerve passes through the anterior condyloid foramen it gives off, according to Luschka, several filaments to the dura mater in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull. The descendens hypoglossi is a long slender branch, which quits the hypoglossal where it turns round the occipital artery. It descends obliquely across the sheath of the carotid vessels, and joins the communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves, just below the middle of the neck, to form a loop. From the convexity of this loop branches pass forwards to supply the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno- thyroid, and both bellies of the Omo-hyoid. According to Arnold, another filament descends in front of the vessels into the chest, and joins the cardiac and phrenic nerves. The descendens hypoglossi is occasionally contained in the sheath of the carotid vessels, being sometimes placed over, and sometimes beneath the internal jugular vein. The thyro-hyoid is a small branch, arising from the hypoglossal near the posterior border of the Hyo-glossus ; it passes obliquely across the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and supplies the Thyro-hyoid muscle.

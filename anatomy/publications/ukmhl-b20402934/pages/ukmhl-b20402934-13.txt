TO THE PREFACE THIETEENTH EDITION TT7HEN Heney Gray published this work, in 1858, he entitled ' ' it 'Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical,' and he introduced under each subdivision such observations on practical points of Surgery as show the necessity of an accurate acquaintance with the anatomy of the part under examination. This was the first time that such an endeavour had been made by an English Anatomist. In preparing this edition, the Editor has endeavoured to follow in the lines originally laid down by the Author, and has tried to keep before himself the fact that the work is intended for Students of Surgery rather than for the Scientific Anatomist. Not that the Editor would wish to disparage, for an instant, the study of Philosophical or Scientific Anatomy, but that he thought it right, considering the class of students for whom the work is primarily intended, that he should be practical rather than abstract and theoretical. Accordingly, he has not altered in any way the original plan of the work, but has endeavoured to render it more practical, and of more use to the student, who will hereafter have to apply his knowledge of Anatomy to his practice of Surgery, by introducing a considerably increased amount of Surgical Anatomy, and by pointing out the bearings of Anatomy on the practice of Surgery. In addition to this, the whole work has undergone a careful revision, and in some minor details a rearrangement has been made.

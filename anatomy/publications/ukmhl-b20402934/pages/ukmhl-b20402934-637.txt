THORACIC AORTA 589 costal muscle, covered in front by the pleura and a thin fascia. It then passes between the two layers of Intercostal muscles, and having ascended obliquely to the lower border of the rib above, divides, near the angle of that bone, into two branches: of these the larger runs in the groove, on the lower border of the rib above; the smaller branch along the upper border of the rib below; passing forward, they supply the Intercostal muscles, and anastomose with the anterior intercostal branches of the internal mammary, and with the thoracic branches of Fig. 367.â€”The abtlominal aorta and its branches. the axillary artery. The first aortic intercostal anastomoses with the superior intercostal, and the last three pass between the abdominal muscles, inosculating with the epigastric in front, and with the phrenic and lumbar arteries. Each intercostal artery is accompanied by a vein and nerve, the former being above, and the latter below, except in the upper intercostal spaces, where the nerve is at first above the artery. The arteries are protected from pressure during the action of the Intercostal muscles, by fibrous arches thrown across, and attached by each

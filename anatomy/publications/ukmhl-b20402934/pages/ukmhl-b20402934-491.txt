ANTERIOB THORACIC REGION 445 cartilages of all the true ribs, with the exception, frequently, of the first, or of he seventh or both ; and from the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle of the abdomeir The fibres from this extensive origin converge towards its insertion, giving to the muscle a radiated appearance. Those fibres which arise rom the davicle pass obliquely outwards and downwards, and are usually separated from the rest by a cellular interval: those from the lower part of the sternum and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, pass upwards and outwards; whils he middle fibres pass horizontally. They all terminate in a flat tendon, about two inches broad which is inserted into the anterior bicipital ndge of the humerus. This Fig. -Muscles of the chest and front of the arm. Superficial view. tendon consists of two lamina, placed one in front of the other and usually blended together below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the clavicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscle ; and its fibres are inserted m the same order as that in which they arise ; that is to say, the outermost fibres ot origin from the clavicle are inserted at the uppermost part of the tendon; tlie upper fibres of origin from the sternum pass down to the lowermost part ot this anterior lamina of the tendon and extend as low as the tendon of the Deltoid and join with it. The posterior lamina of the tendon receives the attachment ot the

LATERAL VENTRICLES 713 with cilia scattered here and there in patches. It is moistened by a serous fluid, which is sometimes, even in health, secreted in considerable quantity. These cavities are two in number, one in each hemisphere, and they are separated from each other by a vertical septum, the septum lucidum. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity, or body, and three smaller cavities or cornua, which extend from it in different directions. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards into the substance of the frontal lobe. The posterior cornu, called the digital cavity, curves backwards into the occipital lobe. The middle cornu descends into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The central cavity, or body of the lateral ventricle, is triangular in form. It is bounded, above, by the under surface of the corpus callosum, which forms the Fig. 425.â€”The lateral ventricles of the brain. roof of the cavity. Internally is a vertical partition, the sejJtum lucidum, which separates it from the opposite ventricle, and connects the under surface of the corpus callosum with the fornix. Its floor is formed by the following parts, enumerated in their order of position, from before backwards : the corpus striatum, tcenia semicircularis, optic thalamus, choroid plexics, fornix, and commencement of its corpus fimbriatum. The anterior cornu is triangular in form, passing outwards into the frontal lobe, and curving round the anterior extremity of the corpus striatum. It is bounded, above, by the corpus callosum t below and externally, by the corpus striatum ; and in front, by the reflected portion of the corpus callosum. The posterior cornu, or digital cavity, curves backwards into the substance of the occipital lobe, its direction being backwards and outwards, and then inwards'. On its inner wall is seen a longitudinal eminence, which is produced by the

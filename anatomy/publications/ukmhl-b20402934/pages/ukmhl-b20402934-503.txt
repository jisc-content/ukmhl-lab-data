ANTERIOK BRACHIAL REGION 457 given off both on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the forearm, separating the deep from the superficial layer of muscles. Numerous apertures exist in the fascia for the passage of vessels and nerves ; one of these, of large size, situated at the front of the elbow, serves for the passage of a communicating branch between the superficial and deep veins. The muscles of the forearm may be subdivided into groups corresponding to the region they occupy. One group occupies the inner and anterior aspect of the forearm, and comprises the Flexor and Pronator muscles. Another group occupies its outer side ; and a third its posterior aspect. The two latter groups include all the Extensor and Supinator muscles. Anteeior Brachial Region Superficial Layer Pronator radii teres. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Flexor carpi radialis. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Palmaris longus. These muscles take origin from the internal condyle of the humerus by a common tendon. The Pronator radii teres arises by two heads. One, the larger and more superficial, arises from the humerus, immediately above the internal condyle, and from the tendon common to the origin of the other muscles ; also from the fascia of the forearm, and intermuscular septum between it and the Flexor carpi radialis. The other head is a thin fasciculus, which arises from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, joining the preceding at an acute angle. Between the two heads passes the median nerve. The muscle passes obliquely across the forearm from the inner to the outer side, and terminates in a fiat tendon, which turns over the outer margin of the radius, and is inserted into a rough impression at the middle of the outer surface of the shaft of that bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the deep fascia, the Supinator longus, and the radial vessels and nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Brachialis anticus, Flexor sublimis digitorum, the median nerve, and ulnar artery: the small, or deep, head being interposed between the two latter structures. Its outer border forms the inner boundary of a triangular space, in which is placed the brachial artery, median nerve, and tendon of the Biceps muscle. Its inner border is in contact with the Flexor carpi radialis. Surgical Anatomy.—This muscle, when suddenly brought into very active use, as in the game of lawn tennis, is apt to be strained, producing slight swelling, tenderness, and pain on putting the muscle into action. This is known as ' lawn-tennis arm.' The Flexor carpi radialis lies on the inner side of the preceding muscle. It arises from the internal condyle by the common tendon, from the fascia of the fore- arm, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the Pronator radii teres, on the outside ; the Palmaris longus, internally ; and the Flexor sublimis digitorum, beneath. Slender and aponeurotic in structure at its commencement, it increases in size, and terminates in a tendon, which forms the lower two-thirds of its length. This tendon passes through a canal on the outer side of the annular ligament, runs through a groove in the os trapezium (which is converted into a canal by a fibrous sheath, and lined by a synovial membrane), and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, and by a slip into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. The radial artery lies between the tendon of this muscle and the Supinator longus, and may easily be tied in this situation. Relations.—By its superficial surface, Avith the deep fascia and the integument. By its deep surface, with the Flexor sublimis digitorum, Flexor longus poUicis, and wrist-joint. By its outer border, with the Pronator radii teres and the radial vessels. By its inner border, with the Palmaris longus above, and the median nerve below. The Palmaris longus is a slender, fusiform muscle, lying on the inner side of

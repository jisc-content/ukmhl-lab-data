388 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Sterno-hyoid is a thin, narrow, riband-Uke muscle, which arises from the inner extremity of the clavicle, and the upper and posterior part of the first piece of the sternum; passing upAvards and inwards, it is inserted, by short, tendinous fibres, into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides. This muscle is separated, below, from its fellow by a considerable interval; but they approach one another in the middle of their course, and again diverge as they ascend. It sometimes presents, immediately above its origin, a transverse tendinous intersection, like those in the Eectus abdominis. Relations.—By its suj^erficial surface, below, with the sternum, the sternal end of the clavicle, and the Sterno-mastoid; and above, with the Platysma and deep cervical fascia. By its deejJ surface, with the Sterno-thyroid, Crico-thyroid, and Thyro-hyoid muscles, the thyroid gland, the superior thyroid vessels, the thyroid cartilage, the crico-thyroid and thyro-hyoid membranes. The Sterno-thyroid is situated beneath the preceding muscle, but is shorter and wider than it. It arises from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, below the origin of the Sterno-hyoid, and from the edge of the cartilage of the first rib ; and is inserted into the oblique line on the side of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is in close contact with its fellow at the lower part of the neck ; and is occasionally traversed by a transverse or oblique tendinous intersection like those in the Rectus abdominis. Relations.—By its anterior sitrface, with the Sterno-hyoid, Omo-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid. By its posterior surface, from below upwards, with the trachea vena innominata, common carotid (and on the right side the arteria innominata), the thyroid gland and its vessels, and the lower part of the larynx. The middle thyroid vein lies along its inner border, a relation which it is important to remember in the operation of tracheotomy.

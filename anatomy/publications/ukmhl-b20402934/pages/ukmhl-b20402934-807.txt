SEVENTH. FACIAL muscular fibres of the tongue-the Inferior lingualis muscle. A few of its fibres probably pass through the submaxillary ganghon to the subhngual gland. Before jommg the hngual nerve it receives a small communicating branch from the otic ganglion. The Posterior auricular nerve arises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards m front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the mastoid branch of the auricularis magnus and with the small occipital. As it ascends between the meatus and mastoid process it divides into two branches Fig. 450.â€”The nerves of the scalp, face, and side of th e neck. TerminaUor of su^pratrochlear of infratrochlear nasal The aunmdar branch supphes the Eetrahens aurem and the small muscles on the cranial surface of the pinna. The occipital branch, the larger, passes backwards along the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and supplies the occipital portion of the Occipito-frontahs. ^ The digastric branch usually arises by a common trunk with the Stylo-hvoid branch ; it divides into several filaments, which supply the posterior belly of the Ihgastric; one of these perforates that muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal The stylo-hyoid is a long slender branch, which passes inwards, entering the

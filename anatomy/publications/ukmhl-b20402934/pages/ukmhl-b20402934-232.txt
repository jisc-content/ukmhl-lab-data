THE SKELETON i86 as the surfaces of bone between them, are rough for the attachment of the muscles, which are enumerated on page 138. Lateral Kegion of the Sktll The Lateral Region of the Skull is of a somewhat triangular form, the base of the triangle being formed by a line extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone along the temporal ridge backwards to the outer extremity of the superior curved line of the occiput : and the sides by two lines, the one drawn downwards and backwards from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the angle of the lower jaw, the other from the angle of the jaw upwards and Fig. 174.—Side view of the skull.. backward to the outer extremity of the superior curved line. This region is divisible into three portions—temporal fossa, mastoid portion, and zygomatic fossa. The Temporal Fossa The Temporal Fossa is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, which extends from the external angular process of the frontal upwards and backwards across the frontal and parietal bones, curving downwards behind to terminate in the posterior root of the zygomatic process. This ridge is generally double, at all events in front, where it is most marked. In front, it is bounded by the frontal, malar, and great wing of the sphenoid : externally, by the zygomatic arch, formed conjointly by the malar and temporal bones ; below, it is separated from the

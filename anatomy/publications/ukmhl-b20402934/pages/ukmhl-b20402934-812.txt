CRANIAL NERVES 762 Its branches of distribution are, one to the fenestra rotunda, one to the fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the tympanmn and Eustachian tube. Its branches of communication are three, and occupy separate grooves on the surface of the promontory. -Course and distribution of the eighth pair of nerves. Fig. 453- Glosso-phctryngeal_ Fneumogastfic Spinal accessory One branch, the small deep petrosal, arches forwards and downwards to the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. A second, the long petrosal nerve, runs forwards through a canal close to or in the processus cochleari- formis and enters the foramen lacerum medium, where it joins the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and gener- ally the large superficial petrosal nerve. The third branch runs upwards through the substance of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In its course it passes by the gangliform enlargement of the facial nerve, and, receiving a connecting filament from it, becomes the small superficial petrosal nerve. This nerve enters the skull through a small aperture, situated ex- ternal to the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior surface of the petrous bone; courses for- wards across the base of the skull, and emerges through a foramen in the middle fossa (sometimes the foramen ovale), and joins the otic ganglion. The carotid branches de- scend along the trunk of the internal carotid artery as far as its commencement, com- municating with the pharyn- geal branch of the pneumo- gastric, and with branches of the sympathetic. The pharyngeal branches are three or four filaments which unite opposite the Middle constrictor of the pharynx with the pharyngeal branches of the pneumo- gastric, the external laryn- geal, and sympathetic nerves, to form the pharyngeal plexus, branches from which perforate the muscular coat of the pharynx to supply the muscles and mucous membrane. The muscular branch is distributed to the Stylo-pharyngeus.

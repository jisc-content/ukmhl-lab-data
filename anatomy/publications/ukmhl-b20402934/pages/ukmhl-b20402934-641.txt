593 C(ELIAC AXIS the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pylorus, lying in its course between the layers of the lesser omentum, and giving branches to both surfaces of the organ : at its termination it anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The Hepatic Artery in the adult is intermediate in size between the gastric and splenic ; in the foetus, it is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis. It is first directed forwards and to the right, to the upper margin of the pyloric end of the stomach, forming the lower boundary of the foramen of Winslow. It then passes upwards between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, which supply the corresponding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the vena portae and hepatic duct. The hepatic Fig. 369.- -The coeliac axis and its branches, the stomach having been raised, and the transverse meso-colon removed. artery, in its course along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledochus and portal veins, the duct lying to the right of the artery, and the vena port^ behind. Its branches are, the Pyloric. Gastro-duodenalis Cystic. The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric arterv.

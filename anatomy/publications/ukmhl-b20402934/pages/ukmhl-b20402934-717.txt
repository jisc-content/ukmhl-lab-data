OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 667 clavicle ; it is through these that the axillary and deep cervical glands communicate with each other. Surgical Anatomy.—In malignant diseases, tumours, or other affections implicating the upper part of the back and shoulder, the front of the chest and mamma, the upper part of the front and side of the abdomen, or the hand, forearm, and arm, the axillary glands are Jiable to be found enlarged. The lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity are divided into two sets, super- ficial and deei). Fig. 3^- 397-—Tiie superficial lymphatics and glands of the upper extremity. Axillary glands The superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity commence on the fingers ; two vessels running along either side of each finger, one on the palmar and the other on the dorsal surface. Those on the palmar surface form an arch in the palm of the hand, from which are derived two sets of vessels, which pass up the forearm, taking the course of the subcutaneous veins. The lymphatics from the dorsal surface of the fingers form a plexus on the back of the hand, and, winding around the inner and outer borders of the forearm, unite with those in front. Those from the inner border of the hand accompany the ulnar veins along the inner side

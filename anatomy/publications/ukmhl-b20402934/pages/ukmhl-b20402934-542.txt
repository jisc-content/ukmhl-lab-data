494 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE Fig. 329.—Mnscles of the hij^ and thigh. it from the Gluteus medius and External rotator mnscles be- neath. The upper portion of the muscle is to be altogether de- tached, and the lower portion turned outwards ; the loose are- olar tissue tiUing up the inter- space between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium being removed, the parts already enumerated as exposed by the removal of this muscle will be seen. The Gluteus medius is a broad, thick, radiated muscle, situated on the outer surface of the pelvis. Its posterior third is covered by the Glu- teus maximus; its anterior two-thirds by the fascia lata, which separates it from the integument. It arises from the outer surface of the ilium, between the superior and middle curved lines, and from the outer lip of that portion of the crest which is between them ; it also arises from the dense fascia (Gluteal aponeu- rosis) covering its outer sur- face. The fibres converge to a strong flattened tendon, which is inserted into the oblique line which traverses the outer surface of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa separates the tendon of the muscle from the surface of the trochanter in front of its insertion. Belations.—By its super- ficial mrface,'wiih. the Gluteus maximus behind, the Tensor vaginae femoris • and deep fascia in front. By its deep surface, with the Gluteus minimus and the gluteal ves- sels and superior gluteal nerve. Its anterior border is blended wdth the Gluteus minimus. Its posterior border lies parallel with the Pyriformis, the glu- teal vessels intervening. This muscle should now be divided near its insertion and turned upwards, when the Glu- teus minimus will be exposed. The Gluteus minimus, the smallest of the three Glutei,

312 ARTICULATIONS The Anterior Saero-iliac Ligament (fig. 239) consists of numerous thin ligamentous bands, which connect the anterior surfaces of the sacrum and ihum. The Posterior Saero-iliac (fig. 240) is a strong interosseous ligament, situated in a deep depression between the sacrum and ilium behind, and forming the chief bond of connection between those bones. It consists of numerous strong fasciculi, which pass between the bones in various directions. Three of these are of large size ; the Uoo superior, nearly horizontal in direction, arise from the first and second transverse tubercles on the posterior surface of the sacrum, and are inserted into the rough, uneven surface at the posterior part of the inner surface of the • ilium. The third fasciculus, oblique in direction, is attached by one extremity to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum, and by the Fig. 240.—Articulations of pelvis and hip. Posterior view. other to the posterior superior spine of the ilium; it is sometimes called the oblique saero-iliac ligaf}ient. The position of the saero-iliac joint is indicated by the posterior superior spine of the ilinm. This process is immediately behind the centre of the articulation. 2. Ligaments passing between the Saceum and Ischium (fig. 240) The Great Sacro-sciatic (Posterior). The Lesser Sacro-sciatic (Anterior). The Great or Posterior Sacro-sciatic Ligament is situated at the lower and back part of the pelvis. It is thin, flat, and triangular in form ; narrower in the middle than at the extremities; attached by its broad base to the posterior inferior spine of the ihum, to the fourth and fifth transverse tubercles of the sacrum, and to the lower part of the lateral margin of that bone and the coccyx. Passing obliquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, it becomes narrow and thick; and at its insertion into the inner margin of the tuberosity of the ischium, it increases

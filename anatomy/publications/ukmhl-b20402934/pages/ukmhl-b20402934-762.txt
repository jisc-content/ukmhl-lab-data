NERVOUS SYSTEM one another, pass backwards, across the anterior perforated space, to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius. They are called the ijedimcles of the corpus calloswrn. Posteriorly, the corpus callosum forms a thick rounded fold, called the spleniuin or pad, which is free for a little distance, as it curves forwards, and is then continuous with the fornix. On its upper surface, the structure of the corpus callosum is very apparent, being collected into coarse transverse bundles. Along the middle line is a linear depression, the raphe, bounded laterally by two or more slightly elevated longitudinal bands, called the stricE longitudinales or nerves of Lancisi; and, still more externally, other longitudinal strise are seen, beneath the convolutions which rest on the corpus callosum. These are the strice longitudinales laterales or tcenice tectce. The under surface of the corpus callosum is continuous Fig. 424,â€”Section of the bram. Made on a level with the corpus callosum. behind with the fornix, being separated from it in front by the septum lucidum, which forms a vertical partition between the two ventricles. On each side, the fibres of the corpus callosum extend into the substance of the hemispheres, connecting them together. The greater thickness of the two extremities of this commissure is explained by the fact that the fibres from the anterior and posterior parts of each hemisphere cannot pass directly across, but have to take a curved direction. An incision should now be made throuf^li the corpus callosum, on either side of the raphe, when two large irregular-shaped cavities will be exposed, which extend through a great part of the length of each hemisphere. These are the lateral ventricles. The lateral ventricles are serous cavities, formed by the upper part of the general ventricular space in the interior of the brain. They are Uned by a thin diaphanous lining membrane (the ependyma), covered by nucleated epithelium,

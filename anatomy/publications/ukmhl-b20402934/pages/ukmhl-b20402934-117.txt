SEGMENTATION OF OVUM 71 except at one part, where they remain in contact, and the ovum is converted into a sac, formed by a layer of spheres derived from the upper primary segment and containing at one part another mass of spheres derived from the lower primary seg- ment (fig. 76, b). The inner cells are rather more granular than the outer, beneath Fig. 75.—First stages of segmentation of a mammalian ovum : semi-diagrammatic. (From a drawing by Allen Thomson.) a h ^ z.p.

The ultimate destination of the outermost complete layer of spheres is, at present, doubtful. By some they are believed to be transitory and to gradually Fig. 76.—Ovum of the rabbit at the end of the process of segmentation. ep. Epiblast. hy. Primitive hypoblast, hp.

Adopting the latter and more general view, the ovum would consist of a cavity surrounded by (i) a layer of cells completely lining the interior of the vitelline membrane, and (2) by a second layer internal to these and partially

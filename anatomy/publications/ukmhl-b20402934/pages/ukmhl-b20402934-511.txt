It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna below the in- sertion of the Anconeus, from the interosseous membrane, and from the middle third of the posterior surface of the shaft of the radius. Passing obliquely downwards and outwards, it terminates in a tendon, which runs through a groove on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius, accompanied by the tendon of the Extensor brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. It occasionally gives off two slips, near its HH

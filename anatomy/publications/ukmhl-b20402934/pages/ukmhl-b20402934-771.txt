721 FORAMEN OF MONRO third communicates with the lateral ventricles. Behind is a third opening leading into the fourth ventricle by a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius, or iter a tertio ad quartum ventricuhmi. The fourth, situated in the anterior part of the floor of the ventricle, is a deep pit, which leads downwards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum {;Uer ad infundihulum). A fifth opening existed in the foetus, which communicated behind with a cavity in the pineal gland. A sixth opening also existed in the foetus, which communicated in front with the fifth ventricle. The lining membrane of the lateral ventricles is continued through the foramen of Monro into the third ventricle, and extends along the iter a tertio ^into the fourth ventricle; at the bottom of the iter ad infundibulum, it ends in a cul-de-sac. The foramen of Monro is a foramen by which each lateral ventricle communi- cates with the third ventricle. It is formed by the anterior extremity of the body Fig. 431.â€”Vertical median section of the encephalon, showing the parts in the middle line. I. Gonvoliition of the corpus callosum.

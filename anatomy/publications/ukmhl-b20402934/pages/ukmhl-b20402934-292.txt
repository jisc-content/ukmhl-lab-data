246 THE SKELETON the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic notch. The space between the superior and middle curved Unes and the crest is concave, and affords attachment to the Gkiteus medius muscle. Near the central part of this hne may often be observed the orifice of a nutrient foramen. The inferior curved Hne, the least distinct of the three, commences in front at the upper part of the anterior inferior spinous process, and, taking a curved direction backwards and downwards, terminates at the middle of the great sacro-sciatic notch. The surface of bone included between the middle Fig. 207.â€”Eight os innominatum. External siu-face. Crest of ilium and inferior curved hnes is concave from above downwards, convex from before backwards, and affords attachment to the Gluteus minimus muscle. Beneath the inferior curved hne, and corresponding to the upper part of the acetabulum, is a roughened surface (sometimes a depression), to which is attached the reflected tendon of the Rectus femoris muscle. The Internal Surface (fig. 208) of the iHum is bounded above by the crest; below it is continuous with the pelvic surfaces of the os pubis and ischium, a faint

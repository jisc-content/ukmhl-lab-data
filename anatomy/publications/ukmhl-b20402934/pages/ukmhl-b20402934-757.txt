707 BASE OF THE BRAIN the line of the longitudmal fissure to |th of an inch in front of the hne indicating the position of the fissure of Kolando. The inferior frontal fissure follows the course of the superior temporal ridge on the frontal bone. The intraioarietal fissure begins on a level with the junction of the middle and lower third of the fissure of Eolando, on a line carried across the head from the back of the root of one auricle to that of the other. After passing upwards, it curves backwards, lying parallel to the longitudinal fissure, midway between it and the parietal eminence ; it then curves downwards to end midway between the posterior fontanelle and the parietal eminence. The under surface of each hemisphere presents a subdivision into three lobes, named, from their position, anterior, middle, and posterior. Fig. 422.â€”Relation of the principal fissures and convolutions of the cerebrum to the outer surface of the scalp. (Keid.) The anterior or frontal lobe, of a triangular form, with its apex backwards, is somewhat concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the roof of the orbit, being separated from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius. The middle lobe, which is more prominent, is received into the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and comprises the under part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The posterior or occipital lobe rests upon the tentorium, its extent forwards being limited by the anterior margin of the cerebellum. The various objects exposed to view on the under surface of the cerebrum, in and near the middle line, are here arranged in the order in which they are met with from before backwards. Ceeebeum.

GENERAL ANATOMY 365 hand, tlie fibres are short and more numerous, there is great power, but lessened range. Muscles differ much in size : the Gastrocnemius forms the chief bulk of the back of the leg, and the fibres of the Sartorius are nearly two feet in length, whilst the Stapedius, a small muscle of the internal ear, weighs about a grain, and its fibres are not more than two lines in length. The names applied to the various muscles have been derived: i, from their situation, as the Tibialis, Radialis, Ulnaris, Peroneus; 2, from their direction, as the Rectus abdominis, Obliqui capitis, Transversalis ; 3, from their uses, as Flexors, Extensors, Abductors, etc.; 4, from their shape, as the Deltoid, Trapezius, Rhom- boideus ; 5, from the number of their divisions, as the Biceps, the Triceps; 6, from their points of attachment, as the Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid. In the description of a muscle, the term origin is meant to imply its more fixed or central attachment; and the term insertion the movable point to which the force of the muscle is directed ; but the origin is absolutely fixed in only a very small number of muscles, such as those of the face, which are attached by one extremity to the bone, and by the other to the movable integument; in the greater number, the muscle can be made to act from either extremity. In the dissection of the muscles, the student should pay especial attention to the exact origin, insertion, and actions of each, and its more important relations with surrounding parts. An accurate knowledge of the points of attachment of the muscles is of great importance in the determination of their action. By a knowledge of the action of the muscles, the surgeon is able to explain the causes of displacement in various forms of fracture, and the causes which produce distortion in various deformities, and, consequently, to adopt appropriate treatment in each case. The relations, also, of some of the muscles, especially those in immediate apposition with the larger blood-vessels, and the surface-markings they produce, should be especially remembered, as they form useful guides in the application of a ligature to those vessels. Tendons are white, glistening, fibrous cords, varying in length and thickness, sometimes round, sometimes flattened, of considerable strength, and devoid of elasticity. They consist almost entirely of white fibrous tissue, the fibrils of which have an undulating course parallel with each other, and are firmly united together. They are very sparingly supplied with blood-vessels, the smaller tendons presenting in their interior not a trace of them. Nerves also are not present in the smaller tendons ; but the larger ones, as the tendo Achillis, receive nerves which accompany the nutrient vessels. The tendons consist principally of a substance which yields gelatine. Aponeuroses are flattened or ribbon-shaped tendons, of a pearly-white colour, iridescent, glistening, and similar in structure to the tendons. They are destitute of nerves, and the thicker ones only sparingly supplied with blood-vessels. The tendons and aponeuroses are connected, on the one hand, with the muscles; and, on the other hand, with the movable structures, as the bones, cartilages, ligaments, fibrous membranes (for instance, the sclerotic), and the synovial mem- branes (subcrureus). Where the muscular fibres are in a direct line with those of the tendon or aponeurosis, the two are directly continuous, the muscular fibre being distinguishable from that of the tendon only by its striation. But where the muscular fibre joins the tendon or aponeurosis at an oblique angle, the former terminates, according to Kolliker, in rounded extremities, which are received into corresponding depressions on the surface of the latter, the connective tissue between the fibres being continuous with that of the tendon. The latter mode of attachment occurs in all the penniform and bipenniform muscles, and in those muscles the tendons of which commence in a membranous form, as the Gastrocnemius and Soleus. The fasciae (fascia, a bandage) are fibro-areolar or aponeurotic lamina, of variable thickness and strength, found in all regions of the body, investing the

Call No. welMOmec I /TO SIR BENJAMIN COLLINS BRODIE, BART. F.R.S., D.C.L. SEEJEANT-SURGEON TO THE QUEEN COERESPONDING MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE THIS WOEK IS DEDICATED IN ADMIKATION OF HIS GREAT TALENTS AND IN EEMEMBBANCE OF MANY ACTS OF KINDNESS SHOWN TO THE AUTHOR FROM AN EARLY PERIOD OF HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREERTO THE PREFACE THIETEENTH EDITION TT7HEN Heney Gray published this work, in 1858, he entitled ' ' it 'Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical,' and he introduced under each subdivision such observations on practical points of Surgery as show the necessity of an accurate acquaintance with the anatomy of the part under examination. This was the first time that such an endeavour had been made by an English Anatomist. In preparing this edition, the Editor has endeavoured to follow in the lines originally laid down by the Author, and has tried to keep before himself the fact that the work is intended for Students of Surgery rather than for the Scientific Anatomist. Not that the Editor would wish to disparage, for an instant, the study of Philosophical or Scientific Anatomy, but that he thought it right, considering the class of students for whom the work is primarily intended, that he should be practical rather than abstract and theoretical. Accordingly, he has not altered in any way the original plan of the work, but has endeavoured to render it more practical, and of more use to the student, who will hereafter have to apply his knowledge of Anatomy to his practice of Surgery, by introducing a considerably increased amount of Surgical Anatomy, and by pointing out the bearings of Anatomy on the practice of Surgery. In addition to this, the whole work has undergone a careful revision, and in some minor details a rearrangement has been made.viii PREFACE The Editor is deeply indebted to liis friend Mr. Eoss for much kind assistance in the preparation of this edition, and also for the help that he has rendered him in passing these pages through the press. To Dr. Leonard Eemfry he is also much indebted for his kindness in revising the section on the anatomy of the Female Organs of Generation. Several new illustrations have been added, principally from dissections in the Hunterian Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons. The Editor takes this opportunity of thanking Pro- sector Pearson for the kind interest he has displayed, and assist- ance he has rendered, in the preparation of these drawings, which were taken from dissections made by this master in the art of dissecting.CONTENTS GENEKAL ANATOMY The Blood . .

There are other fluids also which partially subserve the same purpose, as the saliva, the gastric juice, the bile, the intestinal secretion; and others which are purely excrementitious, as the urine. But there is no need to describe the rest in this place, since they are the secretions of special organs, and are described, as far as is judged necessary for the purposes of this work, in subsequent pages. We shall here speak first of the blood, and next of the lymph and chyle. THE BLOOD The blood is a thickish, opaque fluid, of a bright red or scarlet colour when it flows from the arteries, of a dark red or purple colour when it flows from the veins. It is viscid, and has a somewhat clammy feeling ; it is salt to the taste, and has a peculiar faint odour. It has an alkaline reaction. Its specific gravity at 60° F. is about I'055, and its temperature is generally about 100° F., though varying slightly in different parts of the body. General Composition of the Blood.—When blood is drawn from the body and allowed to stand, it solidifies in the course of a very few minutes into a jelly-like mass, which has the same appearance and volume as the fluid blood, and, like it, looks quite uniform. Soon, however, drops of a transparent yellowish fluid begin to ooze out from the surface of this mass and to collect around it. Coincidently with this the clot begins to contract, so that, in the course of about twenty-four hours, the original mass of coagulated blood has become separated into two parts : a ' clot' or ' coagulum,' considerably smaller and firmer than the first-formed jelly-like mass, and a large quantity of yellowish fluid, the serum, in which the clot floats. The clot thus formed consists of a solid, colourless material, called/i&rm, and a large number of minute cells or corpuscles, called hlood-coryuscles, which are entangled and enclosed in the fibrin. The fibrin is formed during the act of solidi- fication. In the fluid blood in the living body there are two substances, named fibrinogen and paraglobulin or serum globulin, which may be termed fibrin-factors. These two materials, when withdrawn from the body, become acted upon by a third material, also contained in the blood, and named a fibrin-ferment, and unite together, forming a solid substance, fibrin. This latter in its process of solidifica- tion encloses and entangles the blood-corpuscles, and thus the clot is formed. It must be stated, however, that recent observations have shown that, in the act of clotting outside the body, solutions of fibrinogen, on addition of fibrin-ferment, clot firmly, provided that the solution has a trace of a calcium salt. Conse- quently paraglobulin would not appear to be necessary for this process. The act of clotting outside the body, which is evidence of the death of the blood, is a process dissimilar to that which occurs inside the body. In the former case a body, fibrinogen, is acted upon by the fibrin ferment, which appears only after the death of the white corpuscles. In the latter, intravascular clotting can be produced in two ways : (i) by directly stimulating living blood, as by the transfixion of an B2 GENERAL ANATOMY artery by a needle; or (2) by injection of proteid bodies, which contain lecithin, and which, when injected into the blood, kill in a few minutes by producing intra- vascular clotting. Further, injection of fibrin-ferment into the blood has negative results; and, again, addition of proteid and lecithin to blood, removed from the body, does not in any way affect the ordinary coagulation process. We may now consider the constituents of the blood in another way. If a drop of blood is placed in a thin layer on a glass slide and examined under the microscope, it will be seen to consist of a number of minute bodies or corpuscles floating in a clear fluid ; and, on more minute examination, it will be found that these corpuscles are of two kinds. The one, greatly preponderating over the other in point of numbers, is termed the coloured corjniscle; the other, fewer in number and less conspicuous, is termed the colourless corjmscle. From this we learn that blood is a fluid holding a large number of corpuscles of two varieties in sus- pension. The fluid is named liqtior sanguinis ov plasma, and must not be confused with the serum spoken of above in connection with the coagulation of the blood. It is serum and something more, for it contains one at least of the elements or factors from which fibrin is formed. The relation of these various constituents of blood to each other will be easily understood by a reference to the subjoined p T [Coloured x (Colourless [Clot Blood j I Fibrin i y Liquor Sanguinis -1 ^ Serum The blood-corpuscles, blood-discs, blood-globules are, as before stated, of two kinds : the red or coloured, and the white or colourless corpuscles. The relative proportion of the one to the other has been variously estimated and no doubt varies under different circumstances. Thus venesection, by withdrawing a large propor- tion of the red globules, and by favouring the absorption of lymphatic fluid into the blood, greatly increases the relative proportion of the white corpuscles. Klein states that in healthy human blood there appears to be one white corpuscle for 600-1200 red ones. The proportion of corpuscles, coloured and colourless com- bined, to liquor sanguinis, is in one hundred volumes of blood about thirty-six volumes of the former to sixty-four of the latter. Coloured corpuscles when examined under the microscope are seen to be cir- cular discs, biconcave in profile, having a slight central depression, with a raised border (fig. i, h). When viewed with a moderate magnifying power, this central de]3ression looks darker than the edge. When ex- FiG.

It is to their aggregation that blood owes its red hue.

These, however, are very scarce in normal blood. The number of red corpuscles in the blood is enormous; between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 are contained in a cubic mil- limetre. Power states that the red corpuscles of an adult would present an aggregate surface of about 3,000 square yards. Human blood-discs present no trace of a nucleus. They consist of two parts : a colourless envelope, or investing membrane, which is composed largely of fatty material, lecithin and cholesterine ; and a coloured fluid contents, which is a solution of a substance named licemoglohin. Hcemoglohin is a3 THE BLOOD proteid compound of a very complex constitution (C(,oo? Hg^^o, N,54, FeSg, O179). It has a great affinity for oxygen, and when removed from the body crystallises readily under certain circumstances. It is readily soluble in water, and the addition of this fluid to a drop of blood speedily dissolves out haemoglobin from the corpuscle. If the web of a frog's foot is spread out and examined under the microscope, the blood is seen to flow in a continuous stream through the vessels, and the corpuscles shoAv no tendency to axlhere to each other or to the wall of the vessel. Doubtless the same is the case in the human body ; but when drawn and examined on a slide without reagents, the blood-globules often collect into heaps like rouleaux of coins (fig. I, c). During life the red corpuscles may be seen to change their shape under pres- sure so as to adapt themselves to some extent to the size of the vessel. They are also highly elastic, for they speedily recover their shape when the pressure is removed. They are soon influenced by the medium in which they are placed, and by the specific gravity of the medium. In water they swell up, lose their shape, and become globular; subsequently the haemoglobin becomes dissolved out, and the envelope can be barely distinguished as a faint, circular outline. Solutions of salt or sugar, denser than the serum, give them a stellate or crenated appear- ance ; and the usual shape may be restored by diluting the solution to the proper point. The same crenated outline may be produced as the first effect of the passage of an electric shock; subsequently, if sufficiently strong, the shock ruptures the envelope. A solution of salt or sugar of the same specific gravity as serum merely separates the blood-globules mechanically without changing their shape. The white corpuscles (fig. 2) are rather larger than the red in human blood, measuring from about 2-0110" ^^Vo of ii^ch in diameter. They consist of a transparent granular-looking protoplasm containing one, two, or more nuclei, and presenting bright granules, usually of a fatty nature, but which sometimes are of a reddish colour, and are then supposed by some observers to be in a transition stage between the white and red corpuscles. When absolutely at rest they are rounded or spheroidal, but under ordi- nary circumstances their form is very various, and they have the remarkable property of un- dergoing ' amoeboid ' changes (fig. 3). That is to say, they have the power of sending out finger-shaped or filamen- AVbite corpuscles of Imman blood, d. Red corpuscles. High power. tous processes of their own substance, by which they move and take up granules from the surrounding sub- stance. In locomotion the corpuscle pushes out a process of its substance—a pseiidopodium, as it is called—and then shifts the rest of the body into it. In the same way, when any granule or particle comes in its way, it wraps a pseudo- FiG. 3.—Human colourless blood-corpuscle, showing its successive changes of outline within ten minutes when kept moist on a warm stage. (Schofield.) '3fci ^ a S !£3 6 V. podium round it, and then withdrawing it, lodges the particle in its own substance. By means of these amoeboid properties they have the powder of wandering or emigrating from the blood-vessels, by penetrating their coats, and thus finding their way into the perivascular spaces. The white corpuscle may be taken as the type of a true animal cell. It has no limiting membrane, but consists of a mass of transparent albuminous substance, B 2 ® Fig oGENERAL ANATOMY 4 called protoijlasm, containing one or more nuclei. These nuclei become more perceptible on the addition of acetic acid. The protoplasm contains bright granules, generally of a fatty nature. The Avhite corpuscles are very similar to, if not identical with, the corpuscles of lymph and chyle, and they also bear a strong resemblance to the cells found in pus. From the fact that cells exactly like the colourless corpuscles are being constantly furnished to the blood by the lymphatic vessels, the chyle-ducts (and even the liver in the foetus), and also from their varying proportions in different parts of the circulation and in different pathological conditions, the colourless corpuscles are often regarded—with at any rate some probability—as an earlier stage of the coloured blood-discs, but the evidence in favour of this cannot be regarded as conclusive. There can be no doubt that during embryonic life the red corpuscles are developed from mesoblastic cells in the vascular area of the blastoderm. They are at first nucleated and resemble white corpuscles, except in their colour and, like them, are possessed of amoeboid movements. They are succeeded by smaller, non-nucleated corpuscles, having all the characters of adult coloured corpuscles, probably formed by a conversion of the former into the latter. So that at birth the nucleated red corpuscles have disappeared. In after life, an important source of the red corpuscles is the red marrow of bones, in which certain cells found in the marrow are converted into coloured blood-corpuscles by the loss of their nuclei, and by their protoplasm becoming tinged with yellow. It is probable, also, that the spleen may be a place for the formation of red corpuscles. This theory^ which was formerly universally believed, and was then discarded for the hypothesis that the spleen was concerned in the destruction of the red corpuscles, has lately been revived by Bizzozero. The question must still be regarded as suh judice. The proportion of white corpuscles appears to vary considerably in different parts of the circulation, being much larger in the blood of the splenic vein and hepatic vein than in other parts of the body, Avhile in the splenic artery they are very scanty. In addition to these corpuscles, a third variety is found in mammalian blood, and has been specially studied and described by Hayem, Bizzozero, and Osier. They are pale circular or oval discs, about one-quarter or one-third the size of the red blood- corpuscles, and apparently contain no nucleus. They have been named blood-jjlates: or blood-plaques, and are su|)posed by Bizzozero to originate the fibrin-ferment^ and to be especially concerned in the coagulation of the blood. The liquor sanguinis or plasma is the fluid part of the blood, and is composed of a permanently fluid portion, the serum, and of fibrin-factors, which unite spon- taneously when out of the body, and by their union form a solid substance, fibrin. These two fibrin-factors are nsumedi fibrinogen and paraglobulin or serum globulin. Paraglobulin is probably contained partly in solution in the plasma, and partly in the colourless corpuscles, and can be obtained by diluting the liquor sanguinis with ten times its volume of ice-cold water, and then transmitting through it a stream of carbon-dioxide. Fibrinogen may be obtained in the same way as paraglo- bulin, but the liquor sanguinis must be still further diluted and the current of carbon-dioxide must pass for a much longer time. When these two fibrin-factors are withdrawn from the body, their union to form fibrin is probably brought about by the agency of a third body, called a fibrin-ferment. Fibrin may be obtained by whipping the blood, after it has been withdrawn from the body, with a bundle of twigs, to which the fibrin, as it coagulates, adheres. Fibrin may also be obtained by filtering the freshly drawn blood of an animal whose corpuscles are large, care being taken to retard coagulation as long as possible. Under these circumstances the corpuscles are retained on the filter, and the liquor sanguinis, passing through, coagulates and separates into fibrin, free from corpuscles, and serum. Fibrin, thus obtained, is a white or bufi'-coloured substance, presenting a stringy appearance, and under the microscope exhibiting fibrillation. When exposed to the air for some time, ii becomes hard, dry, brown, and brittle. It is a proteid compound, insoluble in hot or cold water, alcohol or ether. Under theLYMPH AND CHYLE 5 influence of dilute hydrochloric acid it swells up, but does not dissolve ; but when thus swollen it is easily dissolved by a solution of pepsin. If heated for a considerable time in a solution of dilute hydrochloric acid, it gradually dissolves. Serum is the fluid liquor sanguinis after the fibrin-factors have been separated from it. It is a straw-coloured fluid, having a specific gravity of 1-027, with an alkaline reaction. Upon boiling it becomes solid, on account of the albumen which it contains. It contains also salts, fatty matters, sugar, and gases. Gases of the Blood.^—When blood is exposed to the vacuum of an air-pump, about half its volume is given off in the form of gases. These are carbonic acid, oxygen, and nitrogen. The relative quantities in 100 volumes of arterial and venous blood, at 0° C. and i m. pressure of mercury, are shown in the accompanying table:— Oxygen Carbonic acid Nitrogen Arterial blood . . 16 vols. 30 vols. i to 2 vols. Venous blood i . 6 to 10 vols. 35 vols. i to 2 vols. Eoughly stated they are as follows : Carbonic acid about two-thirds of the whole quantity of gas, oxygen rather less than one-third, nitrogen below one-tenth (Huxley). The greater quantity of the oxygen is in loose chemical combination with the haemoglobin of the blood-corpuscles, but some part is simply absorbed, just as it would be by water. The carbonic acid is in a state of chemical combina- tion with the salts of the serum, especially the sodium, with which it is combined partly as a carbonate and partly as a bicarbonate. The nitrogen is unimportant. It (or at least the greater part of it) is merely absorbed from the atmosphere under the pressure to which the blood is exposed, and can therefore be mechanically removed. Blood-crystals.—Haemoglobin, as stated above, when separated from the blood- corpuscles, readily undergoes crystallisation. These crystals, named licEinoglobin crystals, all belong, with the exception of those obtained from the squirrel, to the rhombic system. In human blood they are elongated prisms (fig. 4, a). In the A. Hgemoglobin crystals from human blood. B. Hfemiu crystals from blood treated with acetic acid, c. H^matoidin crystals from an oid apoplectic clot. squirrel they are hexagonal plates. Other crystals may be obtained by mixing dried blood with an equal quantity of common salt, and boiling it with a few drops of glacial acetic acid. A drop of the mixture placed on the slide will show the crystals on cooling. These are named hcBmin crystals, and consist of small acicular prisms (fig: 4, b). Occasionally in old blood-clots a third form of crystal is found, the h^matoidin crystal (fig. 4, c). LYMPH AND CHYLE Lymph is a transparent, colourless, or slightly yellow fluid, which is conveyed by a system of vessels, named lymphatics, into the blood. These vessels take their rise in nearly all parts of the body, and take up from the worn-out tissues that portion which is still available for purposes of nutrition, and return it into the veins close to the heart, there to be mixed with the mass of the blood. The greater number of these lymphatics empty themselves into one main duct, the thoracic6 GENERAL ANATOMY duct, which passes along the front of the spine, and opens into one of the large veins at the root of the neck. The remainder empty themselves into a smaller duct, which terminates in the corresponding vein on the opposite side of the neck. Chyle is an opaque, milky-white fluid, absorbed by the villi of the small intestines from the food, and carried by a set of vessels similar to the lymphatics, named lacteals, to the commencement of the thoracic duct, where it is intermingled with the lymph and poured into the circulation through the same channels. It must be borne in mind that these two sets of vessels, lymphatics and lacteals, though differing in name, are identical in structure, and that the character of the fluid they convey is different only while digestion is going on. At other times the lacteals convey a transparent, nearly colourless fluid not to be distinguished from lymph. Both these sets of vessels, in their passage to the central duct, pass through certain small glandular bodies, termed lymijliatic glands, where their contents undergo elaboration. Lymph, as its name implies, is a watery fluid. It closely resembles the liquor sanguinis, and contains about 5 per cent of albumen and i per cent of salts. When examined under the microscope it is found to consist of a clear colourless fluid, in which are floating a number of corpuscles, lymph-co^yuscles. These bodies are identical in structure, and not to be distinguished from the white blood- corpuscles previously described. They vary in number in different parts of the lymphatic vessels, and indeed are said by Kolliker to be absent in the smaller ones. They are always increased in number after the passage of the lymph through a lymphatic gland, and are said to be increased in size as the fluid ascends higher in the course of the circulation. Chyle is a milk-white fluid, which exactly resembles lymph in its physical and chemical properties, except that it has in addition to the other constituents of lymph an enormous amount of fatty granules, ' the molecular basis of chyle,' and it is to the presence of these molecules that chyle owes its milky colour. Under the microscope it presents a number of corpuscles, named ' chyle-corpuscles,' which are indistinguishable from lymph-corpuscles or white blood-cells, and the molecular basis, consisting principally of fatty granules of extreme minuteness (fig. 5, a), ^ ^1 1 r.

Lymph and Fig. 5.—Chvle from the lacteals. , , . t ji • chyle alter their passage through their respective glands, if withdrawn from the body and allowed to stand, separate more or less completely into a clear liquid, which is identical with the serum of the blood, and a thin jelly-like clot, consisting of a fibrillated matrix in which lymph-corpuscles or chyle-corpuscles and fatty molecules, as the case may be, are entangled. If the contents of the thoracic duct are exa- mined, especially after a meal, there may be found in it corpuscles with a reddish tinge. These are regarded as immature red corpuscles, or lymph and chyle corpuscles in process of transformation into blood-globules. They frequently give to the surface of clotted chyle and lymph a pinkish hue. They must not be mistaken for mature blood-globules which are sometimes found in lymph and chyle, and which are regarded by most observers as accidental, i.e. produced by the manipulations of the dissector. THE ANIMAL CELL All the tissues and organs of which the body is composed were originally developed from a microscopic body (the ovum), consisting of a soft gelatinous granular material enclosed in a membrane, and containing a vesicle, or small spherical body, inside which are one or more solid spots (see fig. 73). This may be regarded as a perfect cell. Moreover, all the solid tissues can be shown7 THE ANIMAL CELL to consist largely of similar bodies, differing, it is true, in external form, but essentially similar to an ovum. These are also cells. In the higher organisms all such cells may be defined as ' nucleated masses of protoplasm of microscopic size.' The two essentials, therefore, of an animal cell in the higher organisms are, the presence of a soft gelatinous granular material, similar to that found in the ovum, and which is usually styled 2Jrotoplas7n ; and a small spherical body embedded in it, and termed a nucleus ; * the remaining con- stituents of the ovum, viz. its limiting membrane and the solid spot contained in the nucleus, called the nucleolus, are not considered essential to the cell, and in fact many cells exist without them. Protoplasm [sarcode, blastema, germinal matter, or biojjlasm) is a proteid compound, consisting largely of muco-globulin. It also contains certain inorganic substances, as phosphorus and calcium, which latter appears to be essential to its life and function. It is of a semi-fluid, viscid consistence, and appears, sometimes^ either as a hyaline substance, homogeneous and clear, or as a granular substance, consisting of minute molecules embedded in a transparent matrix. These molecules are regarded by some as adventitious material taken in from without, and often probably of a fatty nature, since they are frequently soluble in ether. In most I cells, however, protoplasm shows a more definite structure, consisting of minute striae or fibrils, arranged in a clear transparent matrix, or a honeycombed reticulum, containing in its interstices a homogeneous substance. Protoplasm is insoluble in water, coagulates at 130° Fahr., and has a great affinity for certain staining reagents, as logwood or carmine. The most striking characteristics of protoplasm are its vital properties of motion and nutrition. By motion is meant the power which protoplasm has of changing its shape and position by some internal power in itself, which enables it to thrust out from its main body an irregular process, into which the whole of the protoplasmic substance is gradually drawn, so that the mass comes to occupy a new position. This, on account of its resemblance to the movements observed in the Amoeba or Proteus animalcule, has been termed ' amoeboid movement.' Ciliary movement, or the vibration of hair-like processes from the surface of any structure, may also be regarded as a variety of the motion with which protoplasm is endowed. Nutrition is the power which protoplasm has of attracting to itself the materials of growth from surrounding matter. When any foreign particle comes in contact with the protoplasmic substance, it becomes incorporated in it, by being enwrapped by one or more processes projected from the parent mass and enclosed by them. AVhen thus taken up, it may remain in the substance of the protoplasm for some time without change, and finally may be extruded again. The Nucleus is a minute body, embedded in the protoplasm, and usually of a spherical or oval form, its size having little relation to the size of the cell. It is usually surrounded by a well-defined wall, the nuclear membrane, and is regarded as a portion of the protoplasmic substance, set apart for the purposes of reproduc- tion. The nuclear contents, known as the nuclear substance, is composed of a stroma or network and an interstitial substance, the relative amount of the two varying in different nuclei. In the adult nuclei, and especially in those about to divide, the network is exceedingly well-developed, whilst in the young nuclei it is but ill-formed, and is represented only by short bands or fibrils connecting irregular masses. In adult and in resting nuclei the fibres of the nuclear network stain very readily with certain dyes; they are therefore named Chromatin ; while the insterstitial substance does not stain readily, and is hence called Acliromatin. The nuclear substance differs chemically from ordinary protoplasm in containing j nuclein, in its power of resisting the action of acids and alkalies, in its imbibing more intensely the stain of carmine, hgematoxylin, &c., and in its remaining * In certain lower forms of life, masses of protoplasm without any nucleus have been described by Huxley and others, as cells.g GENEKAL ANATOMY unstained by some reagents which colour ordinary protoplasm-as, for example, ""'^'Theti^^^^^^^ reproduction of cells commences in the nucleus, and is usually described as being brought about by mdirect or by direct d^m.wn.

Delepine.) and it may be that it will hereafter be shown that the division of cells always takes place in this way, and that the process of reproduction of cells by directTHE ANIMAL CELL 9 division is, as is believed by some observers, merely a sort of imperfect or abnormal karyokinesis. The process of reproduction by indirect division commences in the nucleus, the stroma of which undergoes complex changes, leading to the division of this body previous to the cleavage of the protoplasm of the cell. The changes consist briefly of the following, (i) At the commencement of the process the nuclear network is well developed, but shows only slight indications of activity. (2) The chromatic fibrils forming the nuclear network, after rearranging themselves, become thicker, and probably combined in one long filament, which forms a loose convolution. This is called the glomerulus or skein (fig. 6, b). At the same time a number of protoplasmic granules arrange themselves at two points in the cell protoplasm opposite each other; these points are called the ijoles, and the line midway between them, and bisecting at right angles a line connecting the two, is called the equator. (3) The filament becomes arranged in m.ore or less distinct loops converging towards the two poles, resembling somewhat in appearance a rosette or wreath (fig. 6, c). From the poles to the loops, fine threads, not staining like the other (achromatic), are seen bridging across the space left between the filament and the cell protoplasm. These are known as the nuclear sinndle. (4) The loops now become flattened so as to form a festooned ring or star at the equator of the nucleus. This is known as the single star, aster, monaster. The loops begin to break transversely at the equator (fig. 6, d*), having sometimes previously broken at their polar ends. The nuclear spindle or achromatin is very distinct, as well as a radiating arrangement of protoplasmic granules towards the poles. It is at this stage, or sometimes after, that a longitudinal splitting of the filament occurs, so that they become more numerous and more slender. (5) After breaking across at the equator, the chromatic filaments move towards the poles as if they were guided by the achromatic threads. These threads bridge across between the two receding stars, v/hich are known as diaster or daughter stars. The protoplasm, with its radiating granules, begins to group itself around the two poles (fig. 6, e). (6) The daughter stars have now reached the poles; the broken ends become united, so .that each daughter chromatic filament becomes^ a single festooned filament, forming a rosette or wreath, the daugliter rosettes or loreaths. There is now distinct evidence of cleavage in the protoplasm (fig. 6, f). (7) By further irregular contraction the regular arrangement of the loops becomes lost, and the filament presents a convoluted appearance constituting the daughter glomeruli or skeins (fig. 6, g). The cleavage of the protoplasm is now complete except where the achromatic threads are found. (8) By further convolution and contraction the loops of the filament become fused together, and form again a network. The protoplasm is now again in contact with the nuclear network, which serves to form a wall around the nuclei, and two daughter cells with nuclei are formed (fig. 6, h). The remains of the achromatic threads bridge across the intercellular substance, constituting the prickles of prickle cells. In the reproduction of cells by direct division the process is brought about either by segmentation, or by gemmation. In reproduction by segmentation or fission, the nucleus first splits, by becoming constricted in its centre, and thus assuming an hour-glass shape. This leads to a cleavage or division of the whole protoplasmic mass of the cell; and thus we find that two new cells have been formed, consisting of the same substance as the original one, and each containing a nucleus. These daughter cells are of course at first smaller than the original mother cell; but they grow, and the process may be repeated in them, so that multiplication may rapidly take place. In reproduction by gemmation, a budding- off or separation of a portion of the nucleus and parent-cell takes place, and, becoming separated, forms a new organism. The cell-wall, which is not an essential constituent, and in fact is often absent, consists of a flexible, transparent, structureless or finely striated membrane, which is permeable to fluids. As far as is known, every animal cell is derived from a pre-existing cell. The death of cells is accomplished either by their mechanicalGENEEAL ANATOMY TO detachment from the surface, preceded possibly by their bm'sting and discharging their contents, or by various forms of degeneration—fatty, pigmentary, or calcareous. EPITHELIUM All the surfaces of the body—the external surface of the skin, the internal surface of the digestive, respiratory, and genito-urinary tracts, the closed serous cavities, the inner coat of the vessels, and the ducts of all secreting and excreting glands—are covered by one or more layers of simple cells, called epithelium or eijithelial cells. These cells are also present in the sensory and terminal parts of the organs of special sense, and in some other organs, as the pituitary and thyroid bodies. They serve various purposes, forming in some cases a protective layer, in others acting as an agent in secretion and excretion, and again in others being concerned in the elaboration of the organs of special sense. Thus, in the skin, the main purpose served by the epithelium (here called the epidermis) is that of protection. As the surface is worn away by the agency of friction or change of temperature new cells are supplied, and thus the surface of the true skin and the vessels and nerves which it contains, are defended from damage. In the gastro- intestinal mucous membrane and in the glands, the epithelial cells appear to be the principal agents in separating the secretion from the blood or from the alimen- tary fluids. In other situations (as the nose, fauces, and respiratory passages) the chief office of the epithelial cells appears to be to maintain an equable temperature by the moisture with which they keep the surface ahvays slightly lubricated. In the serous cavities they also keep the opposed layers moist, and thus facilitate their movements on each other. Finally, in all internal parts they ensure a perfectly smooth surface. Of late years there has been a tendency on the part of many histologists to divide these several epithelial linings into two classes : into (i) epithelial tissue proper, consisting of nucleated protoplasmic cells, which form continuous masses on the skin and mucous surfaces and the linings of the ducts and alveoli of secreting and excretirig glands ; and (2) endothelium, which is composed of a single layer of flattened transparent squamous cells, joined edge to edge in such a manner as to form a membrane of cells. This is found on the free surfaces of the serous membranes ; as the lining membrane of the heart, blood-vessels, and lymphatics ; on the surface of the brain and spinal cord, and in the anterior chamber of the eye. And though the separation must be an artificial one, since every gradation of transition between the two classes may be observed, it would seem advisable for the purposes of description to employ it. I. True epithelial tissue consists of one or more layers of cells, united toge- FiG. 7.—Epithelial cells from the oral cavity of man. Magnified 350 times. a. Large, h. Middle-sized, c. The same with two nuclei. ther by an interstitial cement-substance, supported on a basement-membrane, and is naturally grouped into two classes according as there is a single layer of cells {simple epithelium), or more than one {stratified epithelium). The variousEPITHELIUM kinds of epithelium, whether arranged in a single layer or in more than one layer, are usually spoken of as squamous or pavement, columnar, spheroidal or glandular, and ciliated. Hhe pavement epithelium (fig. 7) is composed of flat nucleated scales of various shapes, usually polygonal, and varying in size. These cells fit together by their edges, like the tiles of a mosaic pavement. The nucleus is generally flattened, but may be spheroidal. The flattening depends upon the thinness of the cell. The protoplasm of the cell presents a fine reticulum or honeycombed network, which gives to the cell the appearance of granulation. This kind of epithelium is found on the surface of the skin (epidermis) and on mucous surfaces which are subjected to friction. The nails, the hairs, and (in animals) the horns are a variety of this kind of epithelium. A variety of squamous epithelium which is found in the deeper layers of stratified pavement-epithelium has been termed ^jWcA;/e cells. These cells possess short fine fibrils which pass from their margins to those of neighbouring cells, serving to connect them together. They were first probably noticed by Max Schultze and Virchow, and it was believed that by them the cells were dove- tailed together. Subsequently this was shown not to be so, by Dr. Martyn, who pointed out that the prickles were attached to each other by their apices ; and recently Dr. Delepine has stated that he believes the prickles of prickle cells are parts of fibrils forming internuclear bundles between the nuclei of the cells of an epithelium in a state of active growth (see page 9, and fig. 6). The columnar or cylindrical epithelium (fig. 8) is formed of cylindrical or rod- shaped cells, each containing a nucleus, and set together so as to form a complete Fig. 8.—Epithelium of the intestinal Fig. 9.—Simple columnar epithelium, from the villi of the rabbit. Magnified 300 mucous membrane of the intestine, with goblet- times, cells pouring out their contents. (Klein and a. Basement-membrane. membrane. The cells have a prismatic figure, more or less flattened from mutual pressure, and are set upright on the surface on which they are supported. Their protoplasm is always more or less longitudinally striated, and they contain a nucleus which is oval in shape and contains an intranuclear network. This form of epithelium covers the mucous membrane of nearly the whole gastro- intestinal tract and the glands of that part, the greater part of the urethra, the vas deferens, the prostate, Cowper's glands, Bartholini's glands, and a portion of the uterine mucous membrane. Goblet or chalice cells are a modification of the columnar cell. They appear to be formed by an alteration in shape of the columnar epithelium (ciliated or otherwise) consequent on the secretion into the interior of the cell of mucin, the chief organic constituent of mucus, which distends the upper part of the cell, while the nucleus is pressed down towards its deep part, until the cell bursts and the mucus is discharged on to the surface of the mucous membrane, as shown in fig. 9. The spheroidal or glanchilar epithelium (fig. 10) is composed of circular or polyhedral cells. Like other forms of epithelial cells, the protoplasm is a fine reticulum, which gives to the cell the appearance of granulation. They are found in the terminal recesses of secreting glands, and the protoplasm of the cells usually contains the materials which the cells secrete. Ciliated epithelium (fig. 11) may be of any of the preceding forms, but usually inclines to the columnar shape. It is distinguished by the presence of minuteGENEEAL ANATOMY 12 processes, which are direct prolongations of the cell-protoplasm, like hairs or eye- lashes (ciha) standing up from the free surface. If the cells are examined during life or immediately on removal from the living body (for which in the human Fig. io.—Spheroidal epithelium. Magnified 250 times.

The situations in which ciliated epithelium is found in the human body are : the respiratory tract from the nose downwards, the tympanum and Eustachian tube, the Fallopian tube and upper portion of the uterus, the vasa efferentia, coni vasculosi, and first part of the excretory duct of the testicle, and the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. Stratified epithelium consists of several layers of cells superimposed one on the top of the other and varying greatly in shape. The cells of the deepest layer are for the most part columnar Fig. 12.—Part ofperitonealsm-faceofthe central tendon in form, and as a rule form a of diaphragm of rabbit, prepared with nitrate of silver, g-^^.^^ ^^^^^^ placed vertically on the supporting membrane ; above these are several layers of spheroidal cells, which as they approach the surface be- come more and more com- pressed, until the superficial layers are found to consist of flattened scales, the margins of which overlap one another, so as to present an imbricated appearance. Another form of stratified epithelium is found in what has been termed tran- sitional epithelium, such as exists in the ureters and uri- nary bladder. Here the cells of the most superficial layer are cubical, with depressions on their under surfaces, which fit on to the rounded ends of the cells of the second layer, which are pear-shaped, the apices touching the basement-membrane. Between their tapering points is a third variety of cells, filling in the intervals between them, and of smaller size than those of the other two layers. s. Stomata. 1. Lymph-channels, t.

Endothelium.—As before stated, endothelial cells are flattened, transparent, squamous cells, attached by their margins by a semi-fluid homogeneous cement- substance, so as to form a continuous endothelial membrane. Though for the most part these cells are squamous, in some places cells may be found, either isolated or occurring in patches, which are polyhedral or even columnar. These latter cells are frequently to be found lining the stomata of serous membranes, and are supposed to be endothelial cells in an active state of division (fig. 12). As a rule, the endothelial cells are polygonal in outline, with sinuous or jagged margins, and are in close apposition ; the amount of cohesive matter uniting them being so slight as not to be apparent. Their protoplasmic substance appears to be granular, but consists of fibrillae arranged in a network in which the nucleus is contained, limited by a membrane and having a well-developed reticulum. CONNECTIVE TISSUES By the term connective tissue we mean a number of tissues which possess this feature in common, viz. that they serve the general purpose in the animal economy of supporting and connecting the tissues of the frame. These tissues may differ considerably from each other in external appearance, but they present nevertheless many points of relationship with each other, and are moreover developed from the same embryonal elements. They are divided into three great groups: (i) the fibrous connective tissues, (2) cartilage, and (3) bone. The fibrous connective tissues.—Three principal forms or varieties of fibrous connective tissue are recognised :—(i) White fibrous tissue. (2) Yellow elastic tissue. (3) Areolar tissue. They are all composed of a matrix in which cells are embedded, and between the cells are fibres of two kinds, the white and yellow or elastic. The difterence between the three forms of tissue depends on the relative proportion of the two kinds of fibre, in the first variety enumerated the luhite fibre preponderating ; in the second variety the yelloio elastic fibres being greatly in excess of the white; and in the third form, areolar tissue, the two being blended in much more equal proportions. The white fibrous tissue (fig. 13) is a true connecting structure, and serves three purposes in the animal economy. It serves to bind bones together in the form of ligaments, it serves to connect muscles to bones or other structures in the form of tendons, and it forms an invest- ing or protecting structure to various organs in the form of membranes. Examples of where it serves this latter office are to be found in the muscular fasciae or sheaths, the periosteum, and perichondrium ; the investments of the various glands (such as the tunica albuginea testis, the capsule of the kidney, &c.), the investing sheath of the nerves (epineurium), and of various organs, as the penis and the eye (sheath of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum and of the sclerotic). But in all these parts the student must bear in mind that the elastic tissue enters in greater or less proportion. It |)resents to the naked eye the appearance of silvery white glistening fibres, covered over with a quantity of loose, flocculent tissue which binds the fibres together and carries the blood-vessels. It is not possessed of any elasticity, and only the very slightest extensibility; it is ex- ceedingly strong, so that upon the application of any external violence the bone with which it is connected will fracture before the fibrous tissue will give way. When examined under the microscope it is found to consist of waving bands or bundles of minute, transparent, homogeneous filaments or fibrillae, held together by anGENEKAL ANATOMY 14 albuminous semi-fluid cement-substance (fig. 14). In ligaments and tendons these bundles run parallel with each other ; in membranes they intersect one another in different places. The bundles have a tendency to split up longitudinally or send off slips to join other bundles and receive others in return. The cells occurring Fig. 14.—Connective tissue. (Klein and Noble Smith.) a. Tlie white fibrous element—a layer of more or less sliarply-outlined, parallel, wavy bundles of con- nective-tissue fibrils. On the surface of this layer is &, a network of fine elastic fibres. Fig. 15.—Tendon of mouse's tail, stained with logwood, showing chains of cells between the tendon-bundles. (From Quain's ' Anatomy.' E. A. Schafer.) in white fibrous tissue are often called ' tendon cells.' They are situated on the surface of groups of bundles and are quadrangular in shape, arranged in rows in single file, each cell being separated from its neighbours by a narrow line of cement- substance. The nucleus is generally situated at one end of the cell, the nucleus of the adjoining cell being in close proximity to it (fig. 15). Upon the addition of acetic acid to white fibrous tissue it swells up into a glassy-looking indistinguish- able mass. When boiled in water it is converted almost completely into gelatine. Yellow elastic tissue.—In certain parts of the body a tissue is found which when viewed in mass is of a yellowish colour, and is possessed of great elasticity ; so that it is capable of considerable extension, and when the extending force is withdrawn returns at once to its original condition. This is yellow elastic tissue, in which the elastic fibres greatly preponderate, to the almost complete exclusion of the white fibrous element. It is found in this condition in the ligamenta subflava, in the vocal cords, in the longitudinal coat of the trachea and bronchi, in the inner coats of the blood-vessels, especially the larger arteries, and to a very considerable extent in the thyro-hyoid, crico-thyroid, and stylo-hyoid ligaments. It is also found in the ligamentum nuchae of the lower animals. When viewed under the microscope (fig. 16) it is seen to consist of an aggregation of curling fibres, with a well-defined outline. They are considerably larger in size than the fibrillffi of the white fibrous element, and vary much, being from the 2^-4-07) 0 to the toVtt of an inch in diameter. The fibres form bold and wide curves, branch and freely anastomose with each other. They are homogeneous in appearance, and have a tendency to curl up, especially at their broken ends. In some parts where the fibres are broad and large and the network close, the tissue presents the appearance of a membrane, with gaps or perforations corresponding to the inter- vening space. This is to be found in the inner coat of the arteries, and to it the name of fenestrated membrane has been given by Henle. The yellow elastic fibres remain unaltered by acetic acid.CONNECTIVE TISSUES 15 Areolar tissue is so called because its meshes are easily distended, and thus separated into areolae or spaces, which all open freely into each other, and are consequently easily blown up with air, or permeated by fluid, when injected Fig. 16.—Yellow elastic tissue. High power, into any part of the tissue. Such spaces, however, do not exist in the natural condition of the body, but the whole tissue forms one unbroken mem- brane composed of a number of inter- lacing fibres, variously superimposed. Hence the term ' the cellular mem- brane ' is in many parts of the body more appropriate than its more modern equivalent. The chief use of the are- olar tissue is to bind parts together ; while by the laxity of its fibres, and the permeability of its areolae, it allows them to move on each other, and affords a ready exit for inflammatory and other effused fluids. It is one of the most extensively distributed of all the tissues in the body. It is found beneath the skin, in a continuous layer all over the body, connecting it to the subjacent parts. In the same way it is situated beneath the mucous and serous membranes. It is also found between muscles, vessels, and nerves, forming investing sheaths for them, and connecting them with surrounding structures. In addition to this, it is found in the interior of organs, binding together the various lobes and lobules of the compound glands, the various coats of the hollow viscera, and the fibres of muscles &c., and thus forms one of the most important connecting media of the various structures or organs of which the body is made up. In many parts the areolas or interspaces of areolar tissue are occu- pied by fat-cells, constituting adiijose tissue, which will presently be described. Areolar tissue presents to the naked eye a flocculent appearance, somewhat like spun-silk. When stretched out, it is seen to consist of delicate soft elastic threads interlacing with each other in every direction, and forming a network of extreme delicacy. When examined under the microscope it is found to be composed of white fibres and elastic fibres intercrossing in all directions, and united together by a homoge- neous cement or ground-substance, and filled by cellular elements, which contain the protoplasm out of which the whole is developed and regenerated. Fig. 17.—Connective-tissue corpuscles. (Klein and Noble Smith.) m. Migratory connective-tissue cell. The other two are the ordinary branched cells, each with an oblong nucleus. These cell-spaces may be brought into view by treating the tissue with nitrate of silver, and exposing it to the hght. This will colour the fibres and ground-substance, leaving the cell-spaces unstained. The cells of areolar tissue (fig. 17) are of two kinds: i, flattened transparent cells, with an oblong nucleus and more or less branched, and often united togetherGENERAL ANATOMY by thin-brancliecl processes ; and 2, granular cells, some of which are of the size of white blood-corpuscles, and like them possessed of amoeboid movements ; others are of larger size, and do not exhibit amoeboid movements to any appreciable extent. They lie embedded in the ground-substance, and in some situations, where the areolar tissue is loose and the spaces large, so as to contain several cells, they form a sort of lining for it. In other situations where the tissue forms a membranous layer, the flattened cells, here unbranched, form an epithelial-like covering to its surface. Vessels and Nerves of Connective Tissue.—The blood-vessels of connective tissue are very few—that is to say, there are few actually destined for the tissue itself, although many vessels may permeate one of its forms, the areolar tissue, carrying blood to othe*r structures. In white fibrous tissue the blood-vessels usually run parallel to the longitudinal bundles and between them, sending transverse communi- cating branches across, and in some forms, as the periosteum and dura mater> being fairly numerous. In the yellow elastic tissue, the blood-vessels also run between the fibres, and do not penetrate them. Lymphatic vessels are very numerous in most forms of connective tissue, especially in the areolar tissue beneath the skin and the mucous and serous surfaces. They are also found in abundance in the sheaths of tendons, as well as in the tendons themselves. Nerves are to be found in the white fibrous tissue, where they terminate in a special manner; but it is doubtful whether any nerves terminate in areolar tissue ; at all events, they have not yet been demonstrated, and the tissue is possessed of very little sensibility. Development of Connective Tissue.—Fibrous connective tissue is developed from embryonic connective-tissue cells derived from the mesoblast. At an early period of development it consists of nucleated cells and a muco-albuminous fluid, which subsequently becomes a pellucid jelly, and forms the ground-substance. In this ground-substance the two varieties of fibres become developed. As to the manner in which they do so there are two theories, some believing that they are developed from the protoplasm of the cells, others that they are formed by a deposit in the ground-substance. In the former case the protoplasm of the cells is converted wholly into elementary fibres, the nucleus disappearing ; or else the peripheral part of the protoplasm produces the fibrous tissue, the original cell growing again to its original size, and then throwing off a fresh portion to form a new cell, and itself persisting in contact with the fibres it has formed as a permanent connective- tissue corpuscle. Yellow elastic fibres are said by some to be formed by the processes of stellate embryonal cells, which, joining with processes of other cells, form the elastic fibres. Three special forms of connective tissue must be described : the mucoid, the lymphoid or retiform, and basement-membranes. 1. The mucoid or gelatinous connective tissue exists chiefly in the 'jelly of Wharton,' which forms the bulk of the umbilical cord, but is also found in some | other situations in the foetus, as in the pulp of young teeth, and in certain stages of the development of connective tissue in various regions. In the adult, the vitreous humour of the eye is formed of the same material. This tissue consists of nucleated cells, which branch and become connected so as to form trabeculae, in which is contained a jelly-like substance, containing the chemical principle of mucus, or mucin, and in smaller quantities albumen, but no gelatin. Sometimes, as in the vitreous humour of the eye, the cells disappear, and the jelly only remains. 2. Retiform connective tissue (fig. 18) is found extensively in many parts of the body, forming the framework of some organs and entering into the construction of many mucous membranes. It is formed of an interlacement or network of very fine fibres, Avhich closely resemble white fibrous tissue, and in certain situations may be demonstrated to be continuous with it. In many places flattened cells may be seen connected with the fibres and partially concealing them, presenting an appearance as if the tissue were formed of a network of branching and anasto- mosing cells. This, however, is not so, as the cells can be removed or brushedCONNECTIVE TISSUES 17 away, leaving the fibres intact. In many situations the interstices of the fibres are filled with rounded granular corpuscles, and the tissue is then termed lymphoid or adenoid tissue. The neuroglia, or Fig. 18.—Retiform connective tissue, from a lymphatic gland : most of the lymph-cor- puscles are removed. (From Klein's ' Elements of Histology.') . fine gelatinous connective tissue which supports the nervous elements in the cerebro-spinal axis and in the retina, is regarded as a modified form of the retiform connective tissue. 3. Basement-membranes, formerly described as homogeneous membranes, are really a form of connective tissue. They constitute the supporting mem- brane, or membrana propria, supporting the epithelium of mucous membranes or secreting glands, and in other situations. By meanG of staining with nitrate of silver they may be shown to consist of flattened cells in close apposition, and form therefore an example of an epi- thelioid arrangement of connective-tissue cells. In some situations the cells, in- stead of adhering by their edges, give off branching processes, which join with similar processes of other cells and so form a network, rather than a continuous membrane. Adipose Tissue.—In almost all parts of the body the ordinary areolar tissue contains a variable quantity of adipose or fatty tissue. The principal situations where it is not found are the subcutaneous tissue of the eyelids, the penis and scrotum, the nymphse, within the cavity of the cranium, and in the lungs, except near their roots. Nevertheless its distribution is not uniform, in some parts being- collected in great abundance, as in the subcutaneous tissue, especially of \ the abdomen ; around the kidneys; on the surface of the heart between the furrows, and in some other situations. Lastly, fat enters largely into the formation of the -Adipose tissue. High power. The reticulum, c. A capillaiy blood-vessel. starlike appearance, from crystallisation of fatty acids marrow of bones. A distinction must, however, be made between fat and adipose tissue ; the latter being a distinct tissue, the former an oily matter, which in addition to forming adipose tissue is also widely present in the body, as in the fat of the brain and liver, and in the blood and chyle, &c. Fat cells (fig. 19) consist of a number of vesicles, varying in size, but of about- CGENEEAL ANATOMY i8 the average diameter of of an inch. They are formed of an exceedingly delicate protoplasmic membrane, filled with fatty matter, which is liquid during life, but becomes solidified after death. They are round or spherical where they have not been subjected to pres- FiG. 20.—Development of fat. (Klein and sure ; otherwise they assume a more Noble Smith.) or less angular outline. A nucleus is always present and can be easily demonstrated by staining with log- wood ; in the natural condition it is so compressed by the contained oily matter as to be scarcely recog- nisable. These fat-cells are con- tained in clusters in the areolae of fine connective tissue, and are held together mainly by a network of capillary blood-vessels, Avhich are distributed to them. Fat is an inorganised substance, consisting of a liquid material (gly- cerine) in combination with certain fatty acids, stearic, palmitic, and oleic. Sometimes the acids sepa- rate spontaneously before the fat is examined, and are seen under the microscope in a crystalline form, as in fig 19, a. By boiling the tissue in ether or strong alcohol, the fat may be extracted from the vesicle, which is then seen empty and shrunken. Fat is said to be first detected in the human embryo about the fourteenth week. According to Klein, the fat-cells are formed by the transformation of the protoplasmic connective-tissue corpuscles, into which small globules of fat find their way and increase until they distend the corpuscle into the thin mantle of protoplasm which forms the cell-wall, and in which its nucleus is still to be seen (fig. 20). Others of the connective-tissue corpuscles are transformed into the vessels and the lymphatic tissue which accompanies the vessels. . Minute artery, v. Aliuutevem. c.

PIGMENT In various parts of the body ijigvient is found ; most frequently in epithelial cells and in the cells of connective tissue. Pigmented epithelial cells are found forming the external layer of the retina (fig. 21) and on the posterior surface of the iris. Pigment is also found in the epithelial cells of the deeper layers of the cuticle in some parts of the body—such as the areola of the nipple and in coloured patches of skin and especially in the skin of the coloured races, and also in hair. ^^^^ It is also found in the epithelial cells of the olfactory region, 1^^^ and of the membranous labyrinth of the ear. In the connective-tissue cells pigment is frequently met with in the lower vertebrates. In man it is found in the choroid coat of the eye, and in the iris of all but the light blue eyes and the albino. It is also occasionally met with in the cells of retiform tissue and in the pia mater of the upper part of the spinal cord. These cells are characterised by their larger size and branched processes, which, as well as the body of the cells, are filled with granules. The j pigment consists of dark brown or black granules of very small size closely packed] together within the cells, but not invading the nucleus. Occasionally the pigment-, is yellow, and when occurring in the cells of the cuticle constitutes ' freckles.'CARTILAGE 19 CARTILAGE Cartilage is a non-vascular structure which is found in various parts of the body—in adult life chiefly in the joints, in the parietes of the thorax, and in various tubes, such as the air-passages, nostrils, and ears, which are to be kept permanently open. In the foetus at an early period the greater part of the skeleton is cartilaginous. As this cartilage is afterwards replaced by bone, it is called tefiiporary, in contra- distinction to that which remains unossified during the whole of life, and which is called permanent. Cartilage is divided, according to its minute structure, into true or hyaline cartilage, fibrous or fibro-cartilage, and yellow or elastic or reticular cartilage Besides these varieties met with in the adult human subject, there is a variety called cellular cartilage, which consists entirely, or almost entirely, of cells, united in some cases by a network of very fine fibres, in other cases apparently destitute of any intercellular substance. This is found in the external ear of rats, mice, and some other animals, and is present in the chorda dorsalis of the haman embryo, but is not found in any other human structure. The various cartilages in the body are also classified, according to their function and position, into articular, interarticular, costal, and membraniform. Hyaline cartilage, which may be taken as the type of this tissue, consists of a gristly mass of a firm consistence, but of considerable elasticity and of a pearly- bluish colour. Except where it coats the articular ends of bones, it is enveloped in a fibrous membrane, the perichoudriwn, from the vessels of which it imbibes its nutritive fluids, being itself destitute of blood-vessels; nor have any nerves been traced into it. Its intimate structure is very simple. If a thin slice is examined under the micro- scope, it will be found to consist of cells of a rounded or bluntly angular form, lying in groups of two or more in a granular or almost homogeneous matrix (fig. 22). The cells, when arranged in groups of two or more, have generally a straight outline where they are in contact with each other, and in the rest of their circumference are Tounded. The cell-contents consist of clear translucent protoplasm, containing minute granules, and embedded in this are one or two nuclei, having usually a granular appearance, but occasionally being clear and occupied by one or more nucleoli. The cells are embedded in cavities in the matrix, called cartilage lacuncE, which are lined by a distinct transparent membrane called the capsule. Each lacuna is generally occupied by a single cell, but during the division of the cells it may contain two, four, or eight cartilage-cells. By boiling the cartilage for some hours and treating it with concentrated mineral acid, the capsule may be freed from the matrix and can then be demonstrated as a distinct vesicle con- taining the cells. By exposure to the action of an electric shock the cell assumes a jagged outline and shrinks away from the interior of the capsule. The matrix is transparent and apparently without structure, or else presents a dimly granular appearance, like ground glass. Some observers have shown that the matrix of hyaline cartilage, and especially the articular variety, after prolonged maceration, can be broken up into fine fibrils. These fibrils are prob- \ ably of the same nature, chemically, as the white fibres of connective tissue. It \ is believed by some histologists that the matrix is permeated by a number of fine channels, which connect the lacunae with each other, and that these canals Fig. 22.—Human cartilage-cells, from the cricoid cartilage. Magnified 350 times.20 GENERAL ANATOMY communicate with the lymphatics of the perichondrium, and thus the structure is permeated with a current of nutritious fluid. The articular cartilages, the temporary cartilages, and the costal cartilages are all of the hyaline variety. They present minute differences in the size and shape of their cells and in the arrangement of their matrix. In the articular cartilages, which show no tendency to ossification, the matrix is finely granular under a high power ; the cells and nuclei are small and are disposed parallel to the surface in the superficial part, while nearer to the bone they become vertical. Articular cartilages have a tendency to split in a vertical direction, probably from some peculiarity in the intimate structure or arrangement of the component parts of the matrix. In disease this tendency to a fibrous splitting becomes very manifest. Articular cartilage is not covered by perichondrium, at least on its free surface, where it is exposed to friction, though a layer of connective tissue can be traced in the adult over a small part of its circumference continuous with that of the synovial mem- brane, and here the cartilage-cells are more or less branched and pass insensibly into the branched connective-tissue corpuscles of the synovial membrane. Articular cartilage forms a thin incrustation upon the joint-surfaces of the bones, and its elasticity enables it to break the force of any concussion, whilst its smoothness aftbrds ease and freedom of movement. It varies in thickness accord- ing to the shape of the bone on which it lies ; where this is convex the cartilage is thickest at the centre, where the greatest pressure is received ; and the reverse is the case on the concave surfaces of the bones. Articular cartilage appears to imbibe its nutriment partly from the vessels of the neighbouring synovial membrane, partly from those of the bone upon which it is implanted. Mr. Toynbee has shown that the minute vessels of the cancellous tissue as they approach the articular lamella dilate and form arches, and then return into the substance of the bone. In the costal cartilages the cells and nuclei are large, and the matrix has a tendency to fibrous striation, especially in old age (fig. 23). These cartilages are also very prone to ossify. In the Fig -Costal cartilaofe fi'oni man seventy-six years of age, showing the development of fibrous structure in the matrix. In several portions of the specimen two or three generations of cells are seen enclosed in a parent cell-wall. High power. thickest parts of the costal cartilages a few large vascular channels may be detected. This appears at first sight an exception to the statement that cartilage is a non-vascular tissue, but is not so really, for the vessels give no branches to the cartilage-substance itself, and the channels may rather be looked upon as involutions of the peri- chondrium. The ensiform cartilage may be regarded as one of the costal cartilages, and the cartilages of the nose and of the larynx and trachea resemble them in microscopical cha- racters, except the epiglottis and cor- nicula laryngis, which are of the reti- cular variety. The hyaline cartilages, especially in adult and advanced life, are prone to calcify—that is to say, to have their matrix permeated by the salts of lime without any appearance of true bone. The process of calcification occurs also and still more frequently, according to Rollett, in such cartilages as those of the trachea, which are prone afterwards to conversion into true bone. White fibro-cartilage consists of a mixture of white fibrous tissue and cartila- ginous tissue in various proportions ; it is to the first of these two constituents that its flexibility and toughness are chiefly owing, and to the latter its elasticity. When examined under the microscope it is found to be made up of fibrous con-CAETILAGE 21 nective tissue arranged in bundles, with cartilage-cells between the bundles; these to a certain extent resemble tendon-cells, but may be distinguished from them by being surrounded by an investing capsule and by their being less flattened (fig. 24). The fibro-cartilages admit of arrangement into four groups Fig. 24.—White fibro-cartilage from the semilunar —interarticular, connecting, circumferential, and strati- form. The interarticular fibro- cartilages {menisci) are flattened fibro-cartilaginous plates, of a round, oval, tri- angular, or sickle-like form, interposed between the articu- 1 lar cartilages of certain joints. They are free on both surfaces, [ thinner towards their centre ' than at their circumference, and held in position by their margins and extremities being connected to the surrounding- ligaments. The synovial membrane of the joint is prolonged over them a short distance from their attached margins. They are found in the temporo-maxillary, sterno-clavicular, acromio-clavicular, wrist and knee joints. These cartilages are usually found in those joints which are most exposed to violent concussion and subject to frequent movement. Their use is—to maintain the apposition of the opposed surfaces in their various motions; to increase the depth of the articular surfaces and give ease to the gliding movement; to moderate the effects of great pressure and deaden the intensity of the shocks to which the parts may be sub- jected. Humphry has pointed out that these interarticular fibro-cartilages serve an important purpose in increasing the variety of movements in a joint. Thus, in the knee-joint, there are two kinds of motion, viz. angular movement and rotation ; although it is a hinge joint, in which, as a rule, only one variety of motion is permitted ; the former movement taking place between the condyles of the femur and the interarticular cartilage, the latter between the cartilage and the head of the tibia. So, also, in the temporo-maxillary joint, the upward and down- ward movement of opening and shutting the mouth takes place between the I cartilage and the jaw-bone, the grinding movement between the glenoid cavity and j the cartilage, the latter moving with the jaw-bone. The connecting fibro-cartilages are interposed between the bony surfaces of those joints which admit of only slight mobility, as between the bodies of the vertebrae and between the pubic bones. They form discs, which adhere closely to both of the opposed bones, and are composed of concentric rings of fibrous tissue, with cartilaginous laminae interposed, the former tissue predominating towards the circumference, the latter towards the centre. The circumferential fibro-cartilages consist of a rim of fibro-cartilage, which surrounds the margin of some of the articular cavities, as the cotyloid cavity of the hip, and the glenoid cavity of the shoulder ; they serve to deepen the articular surface, and to protect the edges of the bone, j The stratiform fibro-cartilages are those which form a thin coating to osseous I grooves through which the tendons of certain muscles glide. Small masses of fibro-cartilages are also developed in the tendons of some muscles, where they glide over bones, as in the tendons of the peroneus longus and the tibialis posticus. Yellow, or reticular, elastic cartilage is found in the human body in the auricle of the external ear, the Eustachian tubes, the cornicula laryngis, and the I epiglottis. It consists of cartilage-cells and a matrix, the latter being pervaded disc of the patella joint of an ox.

The fibres resemble those of yellow elastic tissue, both in appearance and in being unaffected by acetic acid; and accord- ing to Rollett their continuity with the elastic fibres of the neighbouring tissue admits of being demonstrated. The distinguishing feature of cartilage as to its chemical composition, is that it yields on boiling a substance called chondrii'i, very similar to gelatine, but differing from it in not being precipitated by tannin. According to Kiihne there is a small amount of gelatine in hyaline cartilage. Virchow believes that the semilunar discs in the knee- they yield no chondrin on boiling ; and he appears to regard them as a modification of a tendinous structure, which, however, agrees with the cartilages in the important particular of being noii-vascular. Temporary cartilage and the process of its ossification will be described wdth bone. BONE Structure and Physical Properties of Bone.—Bone is one of the hardest structures of the animal body ; it possesses also a certain degree of toughness and elasticity. Its colour, in a fresh state, is of a pinkish w^hite externally, and deep red within. On examining a section of any bone, it is seen to be composed of two kinds of tissue, one of which is dense and comjmct in texture, like ivory; the other consists of slender fibres and lamellae, which join to form a reticular structure ; this, from its resemblance to lattice-work, is called cancellous. The compact tissue is always placed on the exterior of the bone ; the cancellous is always internal. The relative quantity of these two kinds of tissue varies in different bones, and in difterent parts of the same bone, as strength or lightness is requisite. Close examination of the compact tissue shows it to be extremely porous, so that the difference in structure between it and the cancellous tissue depends merely upon the difterent amount of solid matter, and the size and number of spaces in each ; the cavities being small in the compact tissue and the solid matter between them abundant, whilst in the cancellous tissue the spaces are large and the solid matter in smaller quantity. Bone during life is permeated by vessels and is enclosed in a fibrous membrane, the xieriosteum, by means of which many of these vessels reach the hard tissue. If the periosteum is stripped from the surface of the living bone small bleeding points are seen, which mark the entrance of the periosteal vessels; and on section during life, every part of the bone will be seen to exude blood from the minute vessels which ramify in it. The interior of the bones of the hmbs presents a cylindrical cavity filled with marrow and lined by a highly vascular areolar struc- ture, called the medullary membrane or internal periosteum, which, however, is rather the areolar envelope of the cells of the marrow, than a definite membrane. The periosteum adheres to the surface of the bones in nearly every part, excepting at their cartilaginous extremities. Where strong tendons or ligaments are attached to the bone, the periosteum is incorporated with them. It consists Fig. 25.—Yellow cartilage, ear of horse. High power. joint are wrongly denominated cartilages, since23 BONE of two layers closely united together, the outer one formed chiefly of connective tissue, containing occasionally a few fat-cells ; the inner one, of elastic fibres of the finer kind, forming dense membranous networks, which can be again separated into several layers. In young bones the periosteum is thick, and very vascular, and is intimately connected at either end of the bone with the epiphysial cartilage, but less closely with the shaft, from which it is separated by a layer of soft blas- tema, containing a number of granular corpuscles or ' osteoblasts,' in which ossification proceeds on the exterior of the young bone. Later in life the peri- osteum is thinner, less vascular, and the osteoblasts have become converted into an epithelial layer, which is separated from the rest of the periosteum in many places by cleft-like spaces, which are supposed to serve for the transmission of lymph. The periosteum serves as a nidus for the ramification of the vessels previous to their distribution in the bone; hence the liability of bone to exfoliation or necrosis, when denuded of this membrane by injury or disease. Fine nerves and lymphatics, which generally accompany the arteries, may also be demonstrated in the periosteum. The marrow not only fills up the cylindrical cavity in the shafts of the long bones, but also occupies the spaces of the cancellous tissue and extends into the larger bony canals (Haversian canals) which contain the blood-vessels. It differs in composition in different bones. In the shafts of adult long bones the marrow is of a yellow colour, and contains, in 100 parts, 96 of fat, i of areolar tissue and vessels, and 3 of fluid, with extractive matter, and consists of a matrix of fibrous tissue, supporting numerous blood-vessels and cells, most of which are fat-cells, but some few are ' marrow-cells.' In the flat and short bones, in the articular ends of the long bones, in the bodies of the vertebrae, in the cranial diploe, and in the sternum and ribs, it is of a red colour, and contains, in 100 parts, 75 of water and 25 of solid matter, consisting of albumen, fibrin, extractive matter, salts, and a mere trace of fat. The red marrow consists of a small quantity of areolar tissue, blood-vessels, and numerous cells, some few of which are fat-cells, but the great majority roundish nucleated cells, the true ' marrow-cells ' of Kolliker. These marrow-cells resemble in appearance the white corpuscles of the blood, though they are larger and have a relatively larger nucleus and a clearer protoplasm, but, like them, possess amoeboid movements. Amongst them may be seen smaller cells, which possess a slightly pinkish hue; and it has been stated by Neumann that they are then in a transitional stage between marrow-cells and red blood-corpuscles, and that one of the sources of blood-globules is the marrow of the spongy bones. Giant-cells (inyelo-plaques, osteoclasts), large, multi-nucleated, protoplasmic masses, are also to be found in both sorts of adult marrow, but more particularly in red marrow. They were believed by Kolliker to be concerned in the absorption of bone-matrix, and hence the name which he gave to them—osteoclasts. They excavate small shallow pits or cavities, which are named Hoivship's lacunce, in which they are found lying. Vessels of Bone.—-The blood-vessels of bone are very numerous. Those of the compact tissue are derived from a close and dense network of vessels ramifying in the periosteum. From this membrane, vessels pass into the minute orifices in the compact tissue, running through the canals which traverse its substance. The cancellous tissue is supplied in a similar way, but by a less numerous set of larger vessels, which, perforating the outer compact tissue, are distributed to the cavities of the spongy portion of the bone. In the long bones, numerous apertures may be seen at the ends near the articular surfaces, some of which give passage to the arteries of the larger set of vessels referred to ; but the most numerous and largest apertures are for the veins of the cancellous tissue, which run separately from the arteries. The medullary canal in the shafts of the long bones is supplied by one large artery (or sometimes more), which enters the bone at the nutrient foramen (situated in most cases near the centre of the shaft), and perforates obliquely the compact structure. The medullary or nutrient artery, usually accompanied by one or two veins, sends branches upwards and downwards, to supply the medullaryGENERAL ANATOMY 24 membrane, which Imes the central cavity and the adjoining canals. The ramifica- tions of this vessel anastomose with the arteries both of the cancellous and com- pact tissues.* In most of the flat, and in many of the short spongy bones, one or more large apertures are observed, which transmit, to the central parts of the bone, vessels corresponding to the medullary arteries and veins. The veins emerge from the long bones in three places (KoUiker)—(i) by one or two large veins, which accompany the artery ; (2) by numerous large and small veins at the articular extremities; (3) by many small veins which arise in the compact substance. In the flat cranial bones the veins are large, very numerous, and run in tortuous canals in the diploic tissue, the sides of the canals being formed by a thin lamella of bone, perforated here and there for the passage of branches from the adjacent cancelli. The same condition is also found in all cancellous tissue, the veins being enclosed and supported by osseous structure, and having exceedingly thin coats. When the bony structure is divided, the vessels remain patulous, and do not contract in the canals in which they are contained. Hence the constant occur- rence of purulent absorption after amputation, in those cases where the stump becomes inflamed, and the cancellous tissue is infiltrated and bathed in pus. Lymphatic vessels, in addition to those found in the periosteum, have been traced, by Cruikshank, into the substance of bone, and Klein describes them as running in the Haversian canals. Nerves are distributed freely to the periosteum, and accompany the nutrient arteries into the interior of the bone. They are said by KoUiker to be most numerous in the articular extremities of the long bones, in the vertebrae and the larger flat bones. Minute Anatomy.—The intimate structure of bone, which in all essential particulars is identical in the compact and cancellous tissue, is most easily studied in a transverse section from the compact wall of one of the long bones after maceration, such as is shown in fig. 26. If this is examined with a rather low power the bone will be seen to be mapped out into a number of circular districts : each one of which consists of a central hole, surrounded by a number of concentric rings. These districts are termed Haversian systems; the central hole is an Haversian ca7ial, and the rings around are layers of bone-tissue arranged concentrically around the central canal, and termed lamellcB. Moreover, on closer examina- tion, it will be found that between these lamellae, and therefore also arranged concentrically around the central canal, are a number of little dark specks, the lacuncB, and that these lacunas are connected with each other and with the central Haversian canal by a number of fine dark lines, which radiate like the spokes of a wheel and are called canaliculi. All these structures—the concentric lamellae, * This view is not, however, entertained by all anatomists. Mr. Charles Stewart believes that, in many cases at all events, the vessels of the periosteum supply onlj the circumferential lamelke on the surface of the shaft of the bone, which are formed from this membrane, and that the whole of the rest of its structure is supplied by the vessels of the medullary membrane, and that only very exceptionally does any anastomosis take place between the two sets of vessels. Certainly, in one microscopic section which I had an opportunity of examining, through the kindness of Mr. Stewart, this appeared to be the case.

Others at the surface of the Haversian systems, with canaliculi given off from one side.25 BONE the lacunae, and the canaliculi—may be seen in any smgle Haversian system, forming a circular district round a central, Haversian, canal. Between these circular systems, filling in the irregular intervals which are left between them, are other lamellae, with their lacunae and canaliculi, running in various directions, but more or less curved (fig. 27). These are termed interstitial lamellae. Again, other lamellae, for the most part found on the surface of the bone, are arranged con- centrically to the circumference of bone, constituting, as it were, a single Haversian system of the whole bone, of which the medullary cavity would represent the Haversian canal. These latter lamellae are termed circdimferential, or by some authors primary or fundamental lamellae, to distinguish them from those laid down around the axis of the Haversian canals, which are then termed secondary or special lamellse. The Haversian canals, seen as round holes in a transverse section of bone at or about the centre of each Haversian system, may be demonstrated to be true canals, if a longitudinal section is made, as in fig. 29. It will then be seen that these round holes are tubes cut across, which run parallel with the longitudinal axis Fig. 27.---Transverse section of compact tissue of bone. Magnified about 150 diameters. (Sharpey.) of the bone for a short distance, and then branch and communicate. They vary considerably in size, some being as large as -^^-^ of an inch in diameter ; the average size being, however, about of an inch. Near the medullary cavity the canals are larger than those near the surface of the bone. Each canal, as a rule, contains two blood-vessels, a small artery and vein ; the larger ones also contain a small quantity of delicate connective tissue, with branched cells, the processes of which communicate with the branched processes of certain bone-cells in the substance of the bone. Those canals near the surface of the bone open upon it by minute orifices, and those near the medullary cavity open in the same way into this space, so that the whole of the bone is permeated by a system of blood-vessels running- through the bony canals in the centre of the Haversian systems. The lamellce are thin plates of bone-tissue encircling the central canal, and might be compared, for the sake of illustration, to a number of sheets of paper pasted one over another around a central hollow cylinder. After macerating a piece of bone in dilute mineral acid, these lamellae may be stripped off in a longitu- dinal direction as thin films. If one of these is examined with a high power under the microscope it will be found to be composed of a finely reticular structure, present- ing the appearance of lattice-work made up of very slender, transparent fibres, decussating obliquely, and coalescing at the points of intersection so as to form an exceedingly delicate network. In many places the various lamellae may be seen to26 GENEEAL ANATOMY Fig. 28.—Nucleated bone-cells and their processes, contained in the bone-lacunae and their canaliculi re- spectively. From a section through the vertebra of an adult mouse. (Klein and Noble Smith.) be held together by tapering fibres, which run obliquely through them, pinning or bolting them together. These fibres were first described by Sharpey, and were named by him perforating fibres. The lacun(B are situated between the lamella, and consist of a number of oblong spaces. In an ordinary microscopic section, viewed by transmitted light, they appear a,s dark, oblong, opaque spots, and were formerly believed to be solid cells. Subsequently, when it was seen that the Haversian canals were channels w^hich lodge the vessels of the part, and the canaliculi minute tubes by which the plasma of the blood circulates through the tissue, it was taught that the lacunae were hollow spaces filled during life with the same fluid, and only lined (if lined at all) by a delicate membrane. But this view appears also to be delusive. Ex- amination of the structure of bone, w^hen recent, led Virchowto believe that the lacunae, are occupied during life with a nucle- ated cell, the processes from which pass down the canaliculi—a view which is now universally received (fig. 28). It is by means of these cells that the fluids neces- sary for nutrition are brought into contact with the ultimate tissue of bone. The canaliculi are exceedingly minute channels, Avhich pass across the lamellae and connect the lacunae with neighbouring- lacunae and also with the Haversian canal. From this central canal a number of the canaliculi are given off, which radiate from it, and open into the first set of lacunae, arranged around the Haversian canal, be- tween the first and second lamellae. From these lacunae a second set of canaliculi are given off, wdiich pass outwards to the next series of lacunae, and so on until they reach the periphery of the Haversian system ; here the canaliculi given off from the last series of lacuna? do not communicate with the lacunae of neighbouring Haversian systems, but after passing outwards for a short distance form loops and return to their own lacuna. Thus every part of an Haversian system is supplied with nutrient fluids derived from the vessels in the Haversian canals and traversing the canaliculi and lacunae. The hone-cells are contained in the lacunae, which, however, they do not completely fill. They are flattened nucleated cells, which Virchow has shown are homologous with those of connective tissue. The cells are branched, and the branches, especially in young bones, pass into the canaliculi from the lacuna?. If a longitudinal section is examined, as in fig. 29, the structure is seen to be the same. The appearance of concentric rings is replaced by that of lamellae or rows of lacunae, parallel to the course of the Haversian canals, and these canals appear like half-tubes instead of circular spaces. The tubes are seen to branch and communicate, so that each separate Haversian canal runs only a short distance. In other respects the structure has much the same appearance as in transverse sections. In sections of thin plates of bone (as in the walls of the cells which form the cancellous tissue) the Haversian canals are absent and the canaliculi open into the spaces of the cancellous tissue (medullary spaces), which thus have the same function as the Haversian canals in the more compact bone. Chemical Composition.— Bone consists of an animal and an earthy part intimately combined together. The animal part may be obtained by immersing the bone for a considerable time in dilute mineral acid, after which process the bone comes out exactly the same shape as before, but perfectly flexible, so that a long bone (one of the ribs, for27 BONE Fig. 29.—Section parallel to the surface from the shaft of the femur. Magnified 100 times. example) can easily be tied, in a knot. If now a transverse section is made (fig. 30) the same general arrangement of the Haversian canals, lamells^, lacunae, and canaliculi is seen, though not so plainly as in the ordinary section. The earthy part may be obtained separate by calcination, by which the animal matter is completely burnt out. The bone will still retain its original form, but it will be white and brittle, will have lost about one-third of its original weight, and will crumble down with the slightest force. The earthy matter confers on bone its hardness and rigidity, and the animal matter its tenacity. The animal base is often called car- tilage, but differs from it in structure, in the fact that it is softer and more flexible, Fig. 30.—Section of bone after the re- moval of the earthy matter by the action of acids. a. Haversian canals, b. Lacunge seen from the side, c. Others seen from the surface in hvmellfe which are cut horizontally, and that when boiled with a high pressure it is almost entirely resolved into gelatin. The organic constituent of bone forms about one-third, or 33-3 per cent.; the inorganic matter, tifo-thirds, or 667 percent. ; as is seen in the subjoined analysis of Berzelius :— Oro^anic matter , Inorganic or Earthy matter Some chemists add to this about i per cent, of fat. Some difference exists in the proportion between the two constituents of bone at different periods of life. In the child the animal matter predominates, whereas in aged people the bones contain a larger proportion of earthy matter, and the animal matter is deficient in quantity and quality. Hence in children it is not uncommon to find, after an injury to the bones, that they become bent or only partially broken, whereas in old people the bones are more brittle and fracture takes place more readily. Some of the diseases, also, to which bones are liable mainly depend on the disproportion between the two constituents of bone. Thus in the disease called rickets, so common in the children of the poor, the bones become bent and curved, either from the superincumbent weight of the body, or under the action of certain muscles. This depends upon some defect of nutrition by which bone becomes deprived of its normal proportion of earthy matter, whilst Gelatin and blood-vessels. . 33-30 Phosphate of lime • 51-04 Carbonate of lime . 11-30 Fluoride of calcium . 2-00 Phosphate of magnesia Soda and chloride of sodium i-i6 r2o 100*00GENERAL ANATOMY 28 the animal matter is of unhealthy quality.

Development of Bone.—In the foetal skeleton some bones, such as the long bones of the limbs, are cartilaginous ; others, as the cranial bones, are membranous. Hence two kinds of ossification are described : the intracartilaginous and the intramemhranous ; and to these a third is sometimes added, the subperiosteal; this, however, is the same as the second, only taking place under different cir- cumstances. Intracartilaginous Ossification.—Just before ossification begins the bone is entirely cartilaginous, and in a long bone, which may be taken as an example, the process commences in the centre and proceeds towards the extremities, which for some time remain cartilaginous. Subsequently a similar process commences in one or more places in those extremities and gradually extends through it. The extremity does not, however, Fig. 31 .—Longitudinal section through the ossifying become joined to the shaft of portion of a long bone in the human embryo. the bone until growth has ceased, but remains separated by a layer of cartilaginous tissue termed epiphysial cartilage. The first step in the ossi- fication of the cartilage is that the cartilage-cells, at the point where ossification is com- mencing and which is termed a centre of ossification, enlarge and arrange themselves in rows (fig. 31). The matrix in which they are embedded increases in quantity, so that the cells become further sepa- rated from each other. A deposit of calcareous material now takes place in this matrix, between the rows of cells, so that they become separated from each other by longi- tudinal columns of calcified matrix, presenting a granular and opaque appearance. Here and there the matrix between two cells of the same row also becomes calcified, and thus we have transverse bars of calcified substance stretch- ing across from one calcareous column to another. Thus we have longitudinal groups of the cartilage-cells enclosed in oblong cavities, the walls of which are formed of calcified matrix. These cavities are called the prijuary areolae (Sharpey). At the same time that this process is going on in the centre of the cartilage of which the foetal bone consists, certain changes are taking place on its surface. This is covered by a very vascular membrane, the periosteitm, on the inner surface of which, that is to say, on the surface in contact with the cartilage, are a number of cells called osteoblasts. By the agency of these cells a thin layer of bony tissue is being formed betw^een the periosteum and the cartilage, by the intramem- branous mode of ossification presently to be described. We have then, in this Kegion of calcified matrix.29 BONE first stage of ossification, two processes going on simultaneously: in the centre of the cartilage the formation of a number of oblong spaces, formed of calcified matrix and containing the cartilage-cells enlarged and arranged in groups, and on the surface of the cartilage the formation of a layer of true membrane-bone. The second stage consists in the prolongation into the cartilage of processes of the deeper or osteogenetic layer of the periosteum (fig. 32, ir). The processes consist of blood-vessels and cells (osteoblasts). They excavate passages through the new- formed bony layer by absorption, and pass through it into the calcified matrix (fig. 32). Wherever these processes come in contact with the calcified walls of the YiQ. 32.—Section of foetal bone of cat. Fig. 33.—Part of a longitudinal section of the developing femur of a rabbit. if.

Scluifer.) primary areolae they absorb it, and thus cause a fusion of the original cavities and the formation of larger spaces, which are termed the secondary areolce (Sharpey) or medullary sijaces (Mliller). In these secondary spaces the original cartilage-cells disappear, and their cavities become filled with embryonic marrow, consisting of osteoblasts and vessels, and derived, at all events in part, in the manner described above, from the osteogenetic layer of the periosteum (fig. 33). What becomes of the cartilage-cells is not finally determined. By most histologists they are believed to be converted, after division, into osteoblasts, and so assist in forming the embryonic marrow. Others, on the other hand, believe that they are simply absorbed and take no part in the formation of bone. Thus far, then, we have got enlarged spaces (secondary areolae), the walls ofGENERAL ANATOMY 30 Avhich are still formed by calcified cartilage-matrix, containing an embryonic marrow, derived from the processes sent in from the osteogenetic layer of the peri- osteum, and consisting of blood-vessels and round cells, osteoblasts (fig. 33), some of which probably are derived from the division of the original cartilage-cells, which have disappeared. The walls of these secondary areolae are at this time of only inconsiderable thickness, but they now become thickened by the deposition of layers of new bone on their interior. This pro- cess takes place in the following manner. Some of the osteoblasts of the embryonic marrow, after undergoing rapid division, arrange themselves as an epithelioid layer on the surface of the wall of the space (fig. 34). This layer of osteoblasts forms a bony stratum, and thus the wall of the space becomes gradually covered with a layer of true osseous substance. On this Fig. 35.—Vertical section from the edge of the ossifying portion of the diaphysis of a mstatarsal bone from a foetal calf. (After Miiller.)

By the repetition of this process the original cavity becomes very much reduced in size, and at last only remains as a small circular hole in the centre, containing the remains of the embryonic marrow—that is, a blood-vessel and a few osteoblasts. This small cavity constitutes the Haversian canal of the perfectly ossified bone. The successive layers of osseous matter which have been laid down and which encircle this central canal, constitute the lamellae of which, as we have seen, each Haversian system is made up. As the successive layers of osteoblasts form osseous tissue, certain of the osteoblastic cells remain included between the various bony layers. These continue persistent and remain as the corpuscles of the future bone, the spaces enclosing them forming the lacunas (fig. 34). The mode of the formation of the canaliculi is not known. Such are the changes which may be observed at one particular point, the centre31 BONE of ossification. While they have been going on here a similar process has been proceeding in the same manner towards the end of the shaft, so that in the ossifying bone all the changes described above may be seen in different parts, from the true bone in the centre of the shaft to the hyaline cartilage at the extremities. The bone thus formed differs from the bone of the adult in being more spongy and less regularly lamellated. Thus far, then, we have followed the steps of a process by which a solid bony mass is produced, having vessels running into it from the periosteum. Haversian canals in which those vessels run, medullary spaces filled with foetal marrow, lacunae with their contained bone-cells, and canaliculi growing out of these lacunae. This process of ossification, however, is not the origin of the whole of the skeleton, for even in those bones in which the ossification proceeds in a great measure from a single centre, situated in the cartilaginous shaft of a long bone, a considerable part of the original bone is formed by intramembranous ossification beneath the perichondrium or periosteum ; so that the girth of the bone is increased by bony deposit from the deeper layer of this membrane. The shaft of the bone is at first solid, but a tube is hollowed out in it by absorption around the vessels passing into it, which becomes the medullary canal. This absorption is supposed to be brought about by large ' giant-cells,' which have long been recognised as a constituent of foetal marrow, and which are believed by Kolliker to have the power of absorbing or dissolving bone, and he has therefore named them ' osteoclasts ' (fig. 33,/.) They vary in shape and size, and are known by containing a large number of clear nuclei, sometimes as many as twenty. The occurrence of similar cells in some tumours of bones has led to such tumours being denominated ' myeloid.' As more and more bone is removed by this process of absorption from the interior of the bone to form the medullary canal, so more and more bone is deposited on the exterior from the periosteum, until at length the bone has attained the shape and size which it is destined to retain during adult life. As the ossification of the cartilaginous shaft extends towards the articular ends it carries with it, as it were, a layer of cartilage, or the cartilage grows as it ossifies, and thus the bone is increased in length. During this period of grovv^th the articular end, or epiphysis, remains for some time entirely cartilaginous, then a bony centre appears in it, and it commences the same process of intracartilaginous ossification ; but this process never extends to any great distance. The epiphyses remain separated from the shaft by a narrow cartilaginous layer for a definite time. This layer ultimately ossifies, the distinction between shaft and epiphysis is obliterated, and the bone assumes its completed form and shape. The same remarks also apply to the processes of bone which are separately ossified, such as the trochanters of the femur. The bones, having been formed, continue to grow until the body has acquired its full stature. They increase in length by ossification continuing to extend in the epiphysial cartilage, which goes on growing in advance of the ossifying process. They increase in circumference by deposition of new bone, from the deeper layer of the periosteum, on their external surface, and at the same time an absorption takes place from within, by which the medullary cavity is increased. The medullary spaces which characterise the cancellous tissue are produced by the absorption of the original foetal bone in the same way as the original medullary canal is formed. The distinction between the cancellous and compact tissue appears to depend essentially upon the extent to which this process of absorption has been carried; and we may perhaps remind the reader that in morbid states of the bone inflammatory absorption produces exactly the same change, and converts portions of bone, naturally compact, into cancellous tissue. Intramembranous Ossification.—The intramembranous ossification is that by which the bones of the vertex of the skull are entirely formed. In the bones which are so developed, no cartilaginous mould precedes the appearance of the bone-tissue. In the membrane which occupies the place of the future bone, a little network of bony spicuhe is first noticed, radiating from the point of ossifica- 1 tion. When these rays of growing bone are examined by the microscope, theyGENEEAL ANATOMY 32 are found to consist of a network of fine clear fibres and granular corpuscles, with a ground-substance between. The fibres are termed osteogenic fibres, and soon become dark and granular from calcification, and as they calcify they are found to enclose the granular corpuscles or ' osteoblasts' (fig. 36). The calcifica- tion not only involves the osteogenic fibres, but also the ground-substance of the tissue in which they are contained. The corpuscles at first lie upon the osteo- genic fibres, so that they can be removed by brushing the specimen with a hair- pencil, in order to render the fibres clear; but they gradually become involved in the ossifying matrix, and form the corpuscles of the future bone, the spaces in which they are enclosed constituting the lacunaB. As the tissue increases in thickness, vessels shoot into it, grooving for them- selves spaces or channels, which become the Haversian canals. Thus, the intra- membranous and intracartilaginous pro- cesses of ossification are similar in their more essential features. The number of ossific centres is different in different bones. In most of the short bones ossification commences by a single point in the centre, and proceeds towards the circumference. In the long bones there is a central point of ossifica- tion for the shaft or diaphysis : and one or more for each extremity, the epiphysis. That for the shaft is the first to appear. The union of the epiphyses with the shaft takes place in the reverse order to that in which their ossification began, and appears to be regulated by the direction of the nutrient artery of the bone. Thus, the nutrient arteries of the bones of the arm and fore-arm are directed towards the elbow, and the epiphyses of the bones forming this joint become united to the shaft before those at the opposite extremity. In the lower limb, on the other hand, the nutrient arteries pass in a direction from the knee : that is, upwards in the femur, downwards in the tibia and fibula ; and in them it is observed that the upper epiphysis of the femur, and the lower epiphysis of the tibia and fibula, become first united to the shaft. Where there is only one epiphysis, the medullary artery is directed towards that end of the bone where there is no additional centre ; as towards the acromial end of the clavicle, towards the distal end of the metacarpal bone of the thumb and great toe, and towards the proximal end of the other metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Besides these epiphyses for the articular ends, there are others for projecting parts or processes, which are formed separately from the bulk of the bone. For an account of these, the reader must be referred to the description of the individual bones in the sequel. A knowledge of the exact periods when the epiphyses become joined to the shaft is often of great importance in medico-legal inquiries. It also aids the surgeon in the diagnosis of many of the injuries to which the joints are liable ; for it not infrequently happens that, on the application of severe force to a joint, the epiphysis becomes separated from the shaft, and such injuries may be mistaken for fracture or dislocation. MUSCULAR. TISSUE The muscles are formed of bundles of reddish fibres, endow^ed with the property of contractility. Two kinds of muscular tissue are found in the animal body, viz. that of voluntary or animal life, and that of involuntary or organic life. The muscles of animal life (striped muscles) are capable of being put in action and Fig. 36.—Osteoblasts from the parietal bone of a human embryo thirteen Vv'eeks old. (After Gegenbauer.) ((.

They are composed of bundles of fibres enclosed in a delicate web called the ' internal perimysium,' in contradistinction to the sheath of areolar tissue which invests the entire muscle, the ' external perimysium.' The bundles are termed ' fasciculi'; they are prismatic in shape, of different sizes in different muscles, and for the most part placed parallel to one another, though they have a tendency to converge towards their tendinous attachments. Each fasciculus is made up of a bundle oi fihres, which also run parallel with each other, and which are separated from one another by a delicate connective tissue derived from the peri- 37-— Transverse section T , T 7 • /p N from the sterno-mastoid m mysmm, and termed endomysium (fig. 37). Magnified 50 times. A muscular fibre may be said to consist of a ^ soft contractile substance enclosed in a tubular sheath, named by Bowman the sarcolemma. The fibres are cylindrical or prismatic in shape, and are of no great length, not extending, it is said, further than an inch and a half. They end either by blending with the tendon or aponeurosis, or else by becoming drawn out into a tapering ex- tremity which is connected to the neighbouring fibre by means of the sarcolemma. Their breadth varies in man from i^^^ to -q^q of an inch, the average of the majority being about ^-J-q. As a \f7^S^O^' " \ rule, the fibres do not divide or anastomose ; but Vi/rrTr- ^ occasionally, especially in the tongue and facial «■ TS^^^S^.'-^fSt^- muscles, the fibres may be seen to divide into several branches. The precise mode in which the muscular fibre joins the tendon has been variously described by different observers. It may, perhaps, be sufficient to say that the sarcolemma, or membranous investment of the muscular. fibre, appears to become blended with the tissue of the tendon, and prolonged more or less into the tendon, so that the latter forms a kind of sheath around the fibre for a longer or shorter distance. When muscular fibres are attached to the skin or mucous membranes, their fibres are described by Hyde Salter as becoming continuous with those of the areolar tissue. The sarcolemma, or tubular sheath of the fibre, is a transparent, elastic, and apparently homogeneous membrane of considerable toughness, so that it will some- times remain entire when the included substance is ruptured (see fig. 38). On the internal surface of the sarcolemma in mammalia, and also in the substance of the fibre in the lower animals, elongated nuclei are seen (fig. 55), and in connec- tion with these a row of granules, apparently fatty, is sometimes observed. Upon examination of a muscular fibre by transmitted light under a sufficiently high power, it is found to be apparently marked by alternate light and dark bands or striffi, which pass transversely, or somewhat obliquely, round the fibre (fig. 38). The dark and light bands are of nearly equal breadth, and alternate with great regularity. They vary in breadth from about the ysVo" the ttV0^ inch. Other striae pass longitudinally over the fibres, though they are less distinct than the former. This longitudinal striation gives the fibre the appearance of being- made up of a bundle of fibrillse. The muscular fibre can be broken up either in a longitudinal or transverse direction (fig. 39). If hardened in alcohol, it can be broken up longitudinally, and forms the so-called fibrillge of which some suppose the fibre to be made up. Each fibril is marked by transverse striae, and appears to consist of a single row of minute quadrangular particles, named ' sarcous elements' by Bowman. A still further division, however, is capable of being made, and each of these fibrillaB may be divided into minute threads (fig. 40, B, d). consisting of an alternate dark and light spot. After exposure to the action of dilute hydrochloric acid, the muscular fibre can be broken transversely (fig. 39, B). It then forms discs or plates, consisting of the same quadrangular particles, attached by their lateral surfaces. D34 GENERAL ANATOMY Upon closer examination with a very high power the appearances become more comphcated and are susceptible of various interpretations. The transverse striation, which in figs. 38 and 39 appears as a mere alternation of dark and light bands, is resolved into the appearance shown in fig. 40, which shows a series of broad dark bands, separated by a light band, which is itself divided into two by a dark streak. This streak is termed Krause's membrane ; it is continuoivs at each end with the sarcolemma investing the muscular fibre. Thus it may be said that the fibre is divided into a number of transverse compartments by this membrane, each compartment containing in the centre a dark plate with a bright border above and below; that is to say, between the dark central part and the membrane of Krause. A muscular fibre presents, then, the appearance of the following layers in regular alternation: a dark layer, the transverse disc ; a bright transparent layer, the lateral disc ; a dark line, the intermediate disc or membrane of Krause ; then another lateral disc, a transverse disc, and so on (figs. 40 and 41). This appearance, following the observations of Rollett, is due to the mode of formation Fig. 38.—Two human mus- cular fibres. Magnified 350 times.

Another disc nearly detached, b'. Detached disc, more highly magnified, showing the sarcous elements. of a muscular fibre, which is made up of two principal parts : i, fibrillse ; and 2, a hyaline or faintly granular substance, resembling protoplasm, and called sarco- plasm. The fibrillse are arranged in bundles called muscular columns or sarco- styles, and these again in larger groups, which, collected together, form the fibre. The fibrilL^ are surrounded by the sarcoplasm, which surrounds also the columns and groups of columns, being in these latter situations greater in amount than between the fibrillae. 80 that on transverse section a muscular fibre is seen to be divided into a number of areas, called the areas of Cohnhei7n, more or less poly- hedral in shape, and consisting of the columns of fibrillae surrounded by transparent series of sarcoplasm. And these areas are collected into larger or smaller groups, which in the same manner are surrounded by transparent sarcoplasm. Each area of Cohnheim presents a granular appearance due to the cross-section of its constituent fibrillse, surrounded by a small amount of the hyaline sarcoplasm. The fibrillse extend throughout the whole length of, and are parallel to, the long axis of the35 MUSCULAE TISSUE muscular fibre. They present the following appearances in regular alternation: (i) a dim prismatic or rod-shaped element, the sarcous element of Boioman ; (2) a thin bridge, which joins the sarcous element to (3) a dark granule. Then again another thin bridge joining the same granule to the next sarcous element, and so on. When these fibrillae are collected together into columns, and the columns into muscular fibres, the appearance mentioned above is produced. The sarcous elements, when arranged side by side and almost touching each other, with very little sarcoplasm between them, represent the transverse disc. The bridges, being much thinner than the sarcous element or the dark granules, have between each other a much larger amount of sarcoplasm, and this gives to this part the trans- parent appearance of the lateral disc. And, lastly, the granules joined edge to edge in a row present the appearance of a membrane, which represents the inter- mediate disc.

Finally, in the centre of each sarcous element a transparent lighter band can sometimes be discerned; this is known as the median disc of Hensen, and is due to the substance of the sarcous elements^being here thinner. This form of muscular fibre composes the whole of the voluntary muscles, all the muscles of the ear, those of the larynx, pharynx, tongue, the upper half of the oesophagus, the heart and the walls of the large veins at the point where they open into it. The fibres of the heart, however, differ very remarkably from those of other striped muscles. They are smaller by one-third, and their transverse strias are by no means so distinct. The fibres are made up of distinct quadran- gular cells joined end to end (fig. 42). Each cell contains a clear oval nucleus, situated near the centre of the cell. The extremities of the cells have a tendency I to branch or divide, the subdivisions uniting with offsets from other cells, and ihus producing an anastomosis of the fibres (fig. 42). The connective tissue D 236 GENEEAL ANATOMY Fig, 42.—Anastomosing mus- cular fibres of the heart seen in a longitudinal section. On the right the limits of the separate cells with their nuclei are exhibited somewhat dia- grammatically. between the bundles of fibres is much less than in ordinary striped muscle, and no sarcolemma has been proved to exist. The cajnllaries of striped muscle are very abundant, and form a sort of rect- angular netwwk, the branches of which run longitudinally in the endomysium between the muscular fibres, and are joined at short intervals by transverse anastomosing branches. The larger vascular channels, arteries and veins, are found only in the perimysium, between the muscular fasciculi. The smaller vessels present peculiar saccular dilatations, which are supposed to act as receptacles for the blood during the contraction of the muscular fibres, wdien it is pressed out from some of the capillaries. Nerves are profusely distributed to striped muscle. The mode of their termination wall be described on a subsequent page. The existence of lymphatic vessels in striped muscle has not been ascertained, though they have been found in tendons and in the sheath of the muscle. The unstriped muscle, or muscle of organic life, is found in the walls of the hollow viscera— \iz. the lower half of the oesophagus and the whole of the remainder of the gastro-intestinal tube ; in the trachea and bronchi, and the alveoli and inf undibula of the lungs ; in the gall-bladder and ductus communis choledochus ; in the large ducts of the salivary and pancreatic glands ; in the pelvis and calices of the kidney, the ureter, bladder and urethra ; in the female sexual organs—viz. the ovary, the Fallopian tubes, the uterus (enormously developed in pregnancy), the vagina, the broad ligaments, and the erectile tissue of the clitoris ; in the male sexual organs—viz. the dartos scroti, the vas deferens and epididymis, the vesiculae seminales, the prostate gland, and the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum ; in the ducts of certain glands, as in Wharton's duct ; in the capsule and trabeculae of the spleen; in the mucous membranes, forming the muscularis mucosaB ; in the skin, forming the arrectores pilorum, and also in the sweat-glands; in the arteries, veins, and lymphatics; in the iris and the ciliary muscle. Plain or unstriped muscular fibre is made up of spindle-shaped cells, called contractile fibre-cells, collected into bundles and held together by a cement-sub- stance, in which are contained some connective-tissue corpuscles (fig. 43). These bundles are further aggregated into larger bundles, or flattened bands, and bound together by ordinary connective tissue. The contractile fibre-cells (fig. 44) are elongated, spindle-shaped, nucleated cells of various lengths, averaging from to 3^ of an inch in length, and 4^0-0 to 3^5^00" of an inch in breadth. On transverse section they are more or less polyhedral in shape, from mutual pressure. They present a faintly longitudinal striated appearance, and consist of an elastic cell-wall containing a central bundle of fibrillse, representing the contractile substance, and an oval or rod-like nucleus, which includes, within a membrane, a fine network communicating at the poles of the nucleus with the contractile fibres (Klein). The adhesive interstitial substance, which connects the fibre-cells together, represents the endomysium, or delicate connective tissue which binds the fibres of striped muscular tissue into fasciculi; while the tissue connecting the individual bundles together represents the peri- mysium. The unstriped muscle, as a rule, is not under the control of the will, nor is the contraction rapid and involving the whole muscle, as is the case with the muscles of animal life. The membranes which are composed of the unstriped muscle slowdy contract in a part of their extent, generally under the influence ofNERVOUS TISSUE 37 a mechanical stimulus, as that of distension or of cold ; and then the contracted part slowly relaxes while another portion of the membrane takes up the contraction. This peculiarity of action is most strongly marked in the intestines, constituting their vermicular motion. Chemical Composition of Muscle.—In chemical composition the muscular fibres of both forms consist mainly of a proteid substance—myosin—which Dr. M.

It is readily converted by the action of dilute acids into syntonin or acid-albumen, and by the action of dilute alkalies into alkali-albumen. Muscle, which is neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction when at rest, is rendered acid by contraction, from the development probably of sarcolactic acid. After death, muscle also exhibits an acid reaction, but this appears to be due to post-mortem change. NERVOUS TISSUE The nervous tissues of the body are comprised in two great systems—the cerehro-spinal and the synvpathetic ; and each of these systems consists of a central organ, or series of central organs, and of nerves. The cerebrospinal system comprises the brain (including the medulla oblongata), the spinal cord, the cranial nerves, the spinal nerves, and the ganglia connected with both these classes of nerves. The sympathetic system consists of a double chain of ganglia, with the nerves which go to and come from them. It is not directly connected with the brain or spinal cord, though it is so indirectly by means of its numerous communications with the cranial and spinal nerves. All these nervous tissues are composed chiefly of two different structures—the grey or vesicular, and the ivhite or fibrous. It is in the former, as is generally supposed, that nervous impressions and impulses originate, and by the latter that they are conducted. Hence the grey matter forms the essential constituent of all the ganglionic centres, both those in the isolated ganglia and those aggregated in the cerebro-spinal axis; while the w^hite matter is found in all the commissural portions of the nerve-centres and in all the cerebro-S]3inal nerves. The nerves of the sympathetic system are chiefly composed of a somewhat different material inGENERAL ANATOMY 38 structure, which is named grey or gelatinous nerve-fibre. This form of nerve-fibre is also found in some of the cerebro-spinal nerves. The grey or vesicular nervous substance is distinguished by its dark reddish- grey colour and soft consistence. It is found in the brain, spinal cord, and various ganglia, intermingled with the fibrous nervous substance, and also in some of the nerves of special sense, and in gangliform enlargements which are found here and there in the course of certain cerebro-spinal nerves. It is composed, as its name implies, of vesicles, or corpuscles, commonly called nerve-cells ox ganglion-corpuscles, containing nuclei and nucleoli; the vesicles, together wdth the blood-vessels, in the vesicular nerve-substance, and the nerve-fibres and vessels in the white nerve- substance, are embedded in a peculiar ground-substance, which was regarded by Kolliker as a modified form of retiform connective tissue. It was named by Virchow neuroglia, and consists of large branched cells, the branches passing in every direction amongst the nerve-tissue, thus holding it and binding it together. It is developed from the epiblast, and contains neither the characteristic fibres nor cells Fig. 46.—Nerve-vesicles from the inner part of the grey matter of the convolutions of the human brain.

Each nerve-cell consists of a finely granular protoplasmic material, of a reddish or yellowish-brown colour, which occasionally presents patches of a deeper tint, caused by the aggregation of pigment-granules (fig. 45). No distinct limiting membrane or cell-wall has been ascertained to exist. The nucleus is, as a rule, a large, well-defined, round, vesicular body, often presenting an intranuclear network, and containing a nucleolus which is peculiarly clear and brilliant. The nerve-corpuscles vary in shape and size; some are small, spherical or ovoid, with generally an even outline, such as those frequently found in the spinal ganglia; others are more or less angular, as in the ganglia of the sympathetic; others, again, are caudate or stellate in shape, and are characterised by their large size and by their having one or more tail-like processes issuing from them, which occa- sionally divide and subdivide into numerous branches (fig. 46). These are found in greatest number in the grey matter of the spinal cord. Still others are flask- shaped, as in the cortex of the cerebellum ; or conical, as in the cerebral convolu- tions. For the most part nerve-cells have one or more processes, and they are distinguished, by the number of these jDrocesses, as unipolar, bipolar, or multi- polar cells. These processes are very delicate, apparently tubular, and contain a39 NERVOUS TISSUE similar granular material to that found within the corpuscle. Some of the pro- cesses terminate in fine, transparent fibres, which become lost among the other elements of the nervous tissue; others may be traced until, after losing their granular appearance, they become continuous with an ordinary nerve-fibre. Fig. 47. — Human nerve-tubes. The white or fibroas nerve-substance or nerve-fihre is found universally in the nervous cords, and also constitutes a great part of the brain and spinal cord. The fibres of which it consists are of two kinds, the meduUated or luhite fibres, and the non-medullated or grey fibres. The meduUated fibres form the white part of the brain and spinal cord, and also the greater part of the cerebro-spinal nerves, and give to these structures their opaque, white aspect. When perfectly fresh they appear to be homo- geneous ; but soon after removal from the body they present, when examined by transmitted light, a double outline or contour, as if con- sisting of two parts. The central portion is named the axis-cylinder of Purkinje; around this is a sort of sheath of fatty material, named the luliite substance of Schioann., which gives to the fibre its double contour, and the whole is enclosed in a delicate membrane, the neuri- lemma,^ primitive sheath, or nucleated sheath of Schivann (^g. The axis-cylinder is the essential part of the nerve-fibre, and is always present; the other parts, the medullary sheath and the neurilemma, being occasionally absent, especially at the origin and termination of the nerve-fibre. It undergoes no interruption from its origin in the nerve-centre to its peripheral termination, and must be regarded as a direct prolongation of a nerve-cell. It constitutes about one-half or one-third of the nerve-tube, the white substance being greater in proportion in the nerves than in the central organs. It is perfectly transparent, and is therefore indistinguishable in a perfectly fresh and natural state of the nerve. It is described by Kolliker as being distinguished from the white substance by the fact that, though soft and flexible, it is not fluid and viscid, but firm and elastic, somewhat like coagulated albumen, with which it appears for the most part also to agree in its chemical characters. When examined under a high power it presents the appearance of longitudinal striation, as if composed of very fine, homogeneous fibrillar, held together in a faintly granular interstitial material. Occasionally at its termination the axis-cylinder of a fibre may be seen to break up into exceedingly fine fibrillse, confirming the view of its fibrillar structure. These fibrillffi have been termed the primitive fihrillce of Schultze. The axis-cylinder is said to be enveloped in a very delicate, hyaline sheath, which separates it from the white matter of Schwann. The medullary sheath or ivhite matter of Schvjann is regarded as being a fatty matter in a fluid state, which insulates and protects the essential part of the nerve—the axis-cylinder. The white matter varies in thickness to a very considerable extent, in some forming a layer of extreme thinness, so as to be scarcely distinguishable, in others forming about one-half the nerve-tube. The size of the nerve-fibres, which varies from 12^00" 2W00 0^ inch, depends mainly upon the amount of the white substance, though the axis- cylinder also varies in size within certain limits. The white matter of Schwann does not always form a continuous sheath to the axis-cylinder, but undergoes * In older histological works the term ' neurilemma ' is used to designate the fibrous envelope of the whole nerve, now called ' perineurium.'

These were first described by Eanvier, and are known as the nodes of Banvier (fig. 48). The portion of nerve-fibre between two nodes is called an internodal segment. Fig. 48.—A node of Eanvier of a medidlated nerve- fibre, viewed from above, magnified about 750 dia- meters. The medullary sheath is discontinuous at the node, whereas the axis-cylinder passes from one segment into the other. At the node the sheath (Klein and Noble of Schwann appears thickened. Smith.) Fig. 49.-—Magnified diameters. Fig. 50.—A small nervous branch from the sym- pathetic of a mammal. The neurilemma or primitive sheath is not interrupted at the nodes, but passes over them as a continuous mem- brane. Each internodal seg- ment contains an oval nucleus embedded in the medullary sheath, and occasionally more than one nucleus may be seen in the same internode. Medullated nerve-fibres, when examined, frequently present a beaded or varicose appearance : this is due to mani- pulation and pressure causing the oily matter to collect into drops, and in conse- quence of the extreme delicacy of the primitive sheath, even slight pressure will cause the transudation of the fatty matter, which collects as drops of oil outside the membrane. This is, of course, promoted by the action of ether (fig. 49). The neurilemma or primitive sheath (sometimes called the tubular membrane or sheath of Schwann) presents the appearance of a delicate, structureless membrane. Here and there beneath it, and situated in depressions in the white matter of Schwann, are nuclei sur- rounded by a small amount of protoplasm. The nuclei are oval and somewhat flat- tened, and bear a definite re- lation to the nodes of Ean- vier ; one nucleus generally lying in the centre of each node, though in some few instances two nuclei may be found in the same node. Non-medullated Fibres.— Most of the nerves of the sympathetic system, and some of the cerebro-spinal (see especially the description of the olfactory nerve), consist of another variety of nervous fibres, which are called the grey or gelatinous nerve-fibres —fibres of Bemak (fig. 50). These consist of a bundle of finely striated fibrillae en- closed in a sheath. Nuclei may be detected at intervals in each fibre, situated between the axis-cylinder and the neurilemma. In external appearance the gelatinous nerves are semi-transparent and grey or yellowish-grey. The individual fibres vary in size, generally averaging about half the size of the medullated fibres; but, on the one hand, the primitive fibrillar formed by the breaking up of the cerebro-spinal fibres, as above mentioned, are of hardly appreciable thick- ness ; while, on the other hand, some of the gelatinous fibres (especially those on the olfactory bulb) are said to be three or four times as thick as those of the cerebro-spinal nerves.

Grey White Water 85-2 73-0 Albuminous matter 7*5 9'9 Colourless fat ro 13-9 Eedfat 37 0-9 Osmazome and lactates i'4 I'o Phosphates i'2 1-3 It appears from this analysis that the cerebral substance consists of albumen, dissolved in water, combined with fatty matter and salts. The fatty matters consist of cerebrin, neurin, and lecithin. The two latter were first described by Liebreich as a crystalline phosphuretted fat, which he termed protagon. It seems probable, however, that it is simply a mixture of neurin and lecithin. Cholesterine is also described as one of the chemical constituents of the nervous tissues, being found in conjunction with lecithin. The salts are the phosphates of potash, soda, lime, magnesia, and iron, sulphate of potash and chloride of sodium, with traces of silica. According to Vauquelin, the cord contains a larger proportion of fat than the brain ; and according to L'Heritier, the nerves contain more albumen and more soft fat than the brain. The nervous structures are divided, as before mentioned, into two great systems— viz. the cerehro-S'pinal, comprising the brain and spinal cord, the nerves connected with these structures, and the ganglia situated on them; and the sympathetic, consisting of a double chain of ganglia and the nerves connected with them. All these structures require separate consideration ; they are composed of the two kinds of nervous tissue above described, intermingled in various proportions and having, in some parts, a very intricate arrangement. The brain or encephalon is that part of the cerebro-spinal system which is contained in the cavity of the skull. It is divided into several parts, named the medulla oblongata, pons Varolii, cerebellum, and cerebrum. In these parts the grey or vesicular nervous matter is found partly on the surface of the brain, forming the convolutions of the cerebrum, and partly in the laminae of the cerebellum. Again, grey matter is found in the interior of the brain, collected into large and distinct masses or ganglionic bodies, such as the corpus striatum, optic thalamus, and corpora quadrigemina. Finally, grey matter is found intermingled intimately with the white, but without definite arrangement, as in the corpora dentata of the medulla and cerebellum, or the grey matter in the pons Varolii and the floor of the fourth ventricle. The white matter of the brain is divisible into three distinct classes of fibres. These are, in the first place, the nerves which arise in the grey matter and pass out through the cranial foramina. Next, the fibres which connect the brain with the spinal cord ; that is to say, those which are usually traced upwards from the columns of the spinal cord, through the medulla oblongata into the encephalon, chiefly by means of the anterior pyramids, fasciculi teretes, and restiform bodies, passing through the pons Varolii and crura cerebri to expand into the corpora striata, optic thalamus, and convolutions {corona radiata), and by means of the restiform bodies into the cerebellum. The other class of white fibres in the brain are com- missural, some of the commissures serving to connect different parts of the same hemisphere together (as the fornix, processus e cerebello ad testes, &c.), or even different parts of the same section or organ, as the arciform fibres of the medulla. Most of these commissures are longitudinal; while others, as the corpus callosum and the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii, are transverse, serving to connect opposite hemispheres together, and thus probably securing the single action of a double organ. The manner in which the grey and white matter are intermingled in the brainGENERAL ANATOMY 42 and spinal cord is very intricate, and can only be fully understood by a careful study of the details of its descriptive anatomy in the sequel. The further considera- tion of this subject will therefore be deferred until after the description of the various divisions of which the cerebro-spinal system is made up. The nerves are round or flat- tened cords, formed of the nerve- fibres already described. They are connected at one end with the cerebro-spinal centre or with the ganglia, and are distributed at the other end to the various textures of the body ; they are subdivided into two great classes—the cerebro- spinal, which proceed from the cerebro-spinal axis, and the symjja- tJietic or ganglionic nerves, which proceed from the ganglia of the sympathetic. The cerebro-spinal nerves consist of numerous nerve- fibres collected together and en- closed in a membranous sheath (fig. 51). A small bundle of primitive fibres, enclosed in a tubular sheath, is called a funiculus ; if the nerve is of small size, it may consist only of a single funiculus ; but if large, the funiculi are collected together into larger bundles or fasciculi, which are bound together in a common membranous investment, and con- stitute the nerve. In structure, the common membranous investment, or sheath of the whole nerve, which is called the epineuriuin, as well as the septa given off from it, and which separate the fasciculi, consists of connective tissue, composed of white and yellow elastic fibres, the latter existing in great abundance. The tubular sheath of the funiculi, called the perineurium, consists of a fine, smooth, transparent membrane, which may be easily separated, in the form of a tube, from the fibres it encloses ; in structure it consists of connective tissue, which has a distinctly lamellar arrangement, consisting of several lamellae, separated from each other by spaces containing lymph. The nerve-fibres are held together and supported within the funiculus by delicate connective tissue, called the endoneurium. It is continuous with septa which pass inwards from the innermost layer of the perineurium, and consists of a ground-substance in which are embedded fine bundles of fibrous connective tissue which run for the most part longitudinally. It serves to support the capillary vessels, which are arranged so as to form a network with the elongated meshes. The cerebro-spinal nerves consist almost exclusively of the medullated nerve-fibres, the non-medullated existing in very small proportions. The blood-vessels supplying a nerve terminate in a minute capillary plexus, the vessels composing Avhich pierce the perineurium and run, for the most part, parallel with the fibres; they are connected together by short, transverse vessels, forming narrow, oblong meshes, similar to the capillary system of muscle. Fine non-medullated nerve-fibres accompany these capillary vessels, vaso-niotor fibres, and break up into elementary fibrils, which form a network around the vessel. Horsley has also recently demonstrated certain medullated fibres as running in Fig. 51.—Transverse section through a micro- scopic nerve, representing a compound nerve- bundle, surrounded by perineurium. Magni- ' fied 120 diameters. The medullated fibres are seen as circles witli a central dot, viz. medullary sheath and axis- cylinder, in transverse section. They are em- bedded in endoneurium, containing numerous nuclei, which belong to the connective-tissue cells of the latter. (Klein and Noble Smith.) p.

Lymph-space between perineurium and sur- face of nerve-bundle. y^s^r NERVOUS TISSUE 43 the epineurium and terminating in tactile corpuscles or end-bulbs of Krause, or in small, but perfect, Pacinian corpuscles. These nerve-fibres, which Professor Marshall believes to be sensory, and which he has termed 7ie7'vi nervorum, are considered by him to have an important bearing upon certain neuralgic pains. The nerve-fibres, as far as is at present known, do not coalesce, but pursue an uninterrupted course from the centre to the periphery. In separating a nerve, however, into its component funiculi, it may be seen that they do not pursue a perfectly insulated course, but occasionally join at a very acute angle with other funiculi proceeding in the same direction; from this, branches are given off, to join again in like manner with other funiculi. It must be remembered, however, I that in these communications the nerve-fibres do not coalesce, but merely pass j into the sheath of the adjacent nerve, become intermixed with its nerve-fibres, and again pass on, to become blended with the nerve-fibres in some adjoining funiculus. Nerves, in their course, subdivide into branches, and these frequently com- ' municate with branches of a neighbouring nerve. In the subdivision of a nerve, ) the filaments of which it is composed are continued from the trunk into the branches, and at their junction with the branches of neighbouring nerves the I filaments pass to become intermixed with those of the other nerves in their further 1 progress ; in no instance, however, have the separate nerve-fibres been shown to \ inosculate. The communications which take place between two or more nerves form what is called a plexus. Sometimes a plexus is formed by the primary branches of the trunks of the nerves—as the cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral plexuses—and : occasionally by the terminal funiculi, as in the plexuses formed at the periphery of I the body. In the formation of a plexus, the component nerves divide, then join, and again subdivide in such a complex manner that the individual funiculi become interlaced most intricately ; so that each branch leaving a plexus may contain I filaments from each of the primary nervous trunks which form it. In the forma- tion also of smaller plexuses at the periphery of the body, there is a free inter- I change of the funiculi and primitive fibres. In each case, however, the individual I filaments remain separate and distinct, and do not inosculate with one another. I It is probable that through this interchange of fibres the different branches : passing oft' from a plexus have a more extensive connection with the spinal cord I than if they each had proceeded to be distributed without such connection with other nerves. Consequently, the parts supplied by these nerves have more extended relations with the nervous centres ; by this means, also, groups of muscles may be associated for combined action. The sympathetic nerves are constructed in the same manner as the cerebro- I spinal nerves, but consist mainly of non-meduUated fibres, collected into funiculi, : and enclosed in a sheath of connective tissue. There is, however, in these i nerves, a certain admixture of medullated fibres, and the amount varies in different nerves, and may be known by its colour. Those branches of the sympa- thetic which present a well-marked grey colour are composed more especially of gelatinous nerve-fibres, intermixed with a few medullated fibres ; whilst those of a white colour contain more of the latter fibres, and a few of the former. Occasion- ally, the grey and white cords run together in a single nerve, without any inter- mixture, as in the branches of communication between the sympathetic ganglia and the spinal nerves, or in the communicating cords between the ganglia. The nerve-fibres, both of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic system, convey impressions of a twofold kind. The sensory nerves, called also centrijjetal or afferent nerves, transmit to the nervous centres impressions made upon the ' I peripheral extremities of the nerves, and in this way the mind, through the medium ' of the brain, becomes conscious of external objects. The motor nerves, called also ' centrifugal or efferent nerves, transmit impressions from the nervous centres to the ^ parts to which the nerves are distributed, these impressions either exciting muscular I' contraction, or influencing the processes of nutrition, growth, and secretion. Origin and Termination of Nerves.—By the expression ' the termination ofGENERAL ANATOMY 44 nerve-fibres ' is signified their connections with the nerve-centres, and with the parts they supply. The former are sometimes called their origin, or central termination ; the latter their loeripheral termination. The origin in some cases is single—that is to say, the whole nerve emerges from the nervous centre by a single root; in other instances the nerve arises by two or more roots, which come off from different parts of the nerve-centre, sometimes widely apart from each other, and it often happens, when a nerve arises in this way by two roots, that the functions of these two roots are different; as, for example, in the spinal nerves, each of which arises by two roots, the anterior of which is motor, and the posterior sensory. The point where the nerve root or roots emerge from the nervous centre is named the superficial or ajjparent origin, but the fibres of which the nerve consists can be traced for a certain distance into the nervous centre to some portion of the grey substance, which constitutes the deej) or real origin of the nerve. The exact manner in which the fibres of which the nerve-root is made up arise at their deep origin, is, to a certain extent, uncertain. But it would appear pro- bable that there are two modes in which they originate and are connected with the nerve-cells. If the multipolar nerve-cells are examined, it will be found that one at least of their processes does not branch ; this process is named the axial-cylinder process, and at first has all the characters of an axis-cylinder. Soon, however, it acquires a medullary sheath, and has been traced to be directly continuous with a nerve-fibre. Other processes of a multipolar cell divide and subdivide as they pass away from the cell, until at last they form branches of extreme tenuity, and form an excessively minute network. These processes apparently consist of cell proto- plasm, and are named protoplasm processes. From the network which they form minute medullated nerve-fibres arise. So that it would appear that nerve-fibres arise : first, directly through the passage of the non-branched axis-cylinder process into a fibre; and, secondly, through the minute network formed by the branched protoplasm processes. Peripheral Terminations of Nerves.—The manner in which nerve-fibres ter- minate peripherally are several, and may be conveniently studied in the sensory and motor nerves respectively. Sensory nerves would appear to terminate either in minute primitive fibrillag or networks of these ; or else in special terminal organs, which have been termed peripheral end-organs, and of which there are three principal varieties, viz. the end-bulbs of Krause, the tactile corpuscles of Wagner, and the Pacinian corpuscles. Termination in fibrillae.—When a medullated nerve-fibre approaches its ter- mination, the white matter of Schwann suddenly disappears, leaving only the axis-cylinder, surrounded by the neurilemma, and we have now a non-medullated fibre. This undergoes repeated division, and after a time loses its neurilemma, and consists only of an axis-cylinder, which can be seen, in preparations stained with chloride of gold, to be made up of fine varicose fibrils. Finally, the axis- cylinder breaks up into its constituent primitive nerve-fibrillae, which anastomose with one another, thus forming a network, and often present regular varicosities. This network passes between the elements of the tissue to which the nerves are distributed, which is always epithelial, the nerve-fibrils lying in the interstitial substance between the epithelial cells, and, as is believed by some, actually termi- nating loithin the cells, as minute swellings close to the nucleus. In this way nerve-fibres have been found to terminate in the epithelium of the skin and mucous membranes, and in the anterior epithelium of the cornea. The end-bulbs of Krause (fig. 52) are minute oblong or cylindrical corpuscles, into the interior of which the axis-cylinder of the nerve-fibre passes, and termi- nates in a coiled, plexiform mass or in a bulbous extremity. The corpuscle consists of a simple nucleated capsule, containing a soft, homogeneous core, in which the termination of the axis-cylinder is contained. The white matter of Schwann ceases abruptly as the axis-cylinder enters the corpuscle, but the perineurium is continued inwards with the axis-cylinder, and forms an investment of the core, lining the interior of the capsule. The end-bulbs have been described as occurring45 NERVOUS TISSUE in the conjunctiva (where, in man, they are spheroidal in shape), in the mucous membrane of the mouth, and in the cutis and mucous membrane of the penis, chtoris, and vagina, where they are termed genital corpuscles. The latter have a mulberry-like appearance, from being constricted by connective-tissue septa into from two to six knob-like masses. In the synovial membrane of certain joints (e.g. those of the fingers), rounded or oval end-bulbs have been found ; these are designated articular end-bulbs. The tactile corpuscles (fig. 53), described by Wagner and Meissner, are oval- shaped bodies, made up of connective tissue, and consisting of a capsule, and imperfect membranous septa, derived from it, which penetrate its interior. The axis-cylinders, entering the capsule, pursue a convoluted course, supported by the septa, and terminate in small globular or pyriform enlargements, near the inner surface of the capsule. These tactile corpuscles have been described as occurring in the papillae of the corium of the hand and foot, the front of the fore-arm, the skin of the lips, and the mucous membrane of the tip of the tongue, the palpebral conjunctiva, and the skin of the nipple. They are not found in all the papillge ; Fig. 52.—End-bulb of Krause. a. MeduUated uerve-fibre. &- Capsule of corpuscle. (From Klein's 'Elements of Histology.')

Clear interior sub- stance. but from their existence in those parts in which the skin is highly sensitive, it is probable that they are specially concerned in the sense of touch, though their absence from the papillpe of other tactile parts shows that they are not essential to this sense. The Pacinian corpuscles* (fig. 54) are found in the human subject chiefly on the nerves of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot and in the genital organs of both sexes lying in the subcutaneous tissue ; but they have also been described as connected with the nerves of the joints, and in some other situations, as the mesentery of the cat and along the tibia of the rabbit. Each of these corpuscles is attached to and encloses the termination of a single nerve-fibre. The corpuscle, which is perfectly visible to the naked eye (and which can be most easily demon- strated in the mesentery of a cat), consists of a number of lamellte or capsules, arranged more or less concentrically around a central clear space, in which the nerve-fibre is contained. Each lamella is composed of bundles of fine connective- tissue fibres, and is lined on its inner surface by a single layer of nucleated endo- thelial cells. The central clear space, which is elongated or cylindrical in shape, is filled with a transparent material, in the middle of which is the single medullated fibre, which traverses the space to near its distal extremity. Here it terminates * Often called in German anatomical works ' corpuscles of Vater.'GENEKAL ANATOMY 46 Fig. 54.—Pacinian corpuscle, with its system cavity. of capsules and central in a rounded knob or end, sometimes bifurcating previously, in which case each branch has a similar arrangement. Todd and Bowman have described minute arteries as entering by the sides of the nerves and forming capillary loops in the intercapsular spaces, and even penetrating into the central space. Other authors de- scribe the artery as entering the corpuscle at the pole opposite to the nerve-fibre. Herbst has described a somewhat similar ' nerve-ending' to the Pacinian corpuscle, as being found in the mucous membrane of the tongue of the duck, and in some other situa- tions. It differs, however, from the Pacinian corpuscles, in being smaller, its capsules thinner and more closely approximated, and especially in the fact that the axis-cylinder in the central clear space is coated with a continuous row of nuclei. These bodies are known as the corpiLscles of Herhst. Tactile corpuscles have been described by Grandry as occurring in the papillae of the beak and tongue of birds, and by Merkel as occurring in the papillae and epithelium of the skin of man and animals, especially in those parts of the skin devoid of hair. They consist of a capsule composed of a very deli- cate, nucleated membrane, and contain two or more granular, somewhat flattened cells, between which the medullated nerve-fibre, which enters the capsule by piercing its in- vesting membrane, is supposed to terminate. In the organs of special sense the nerves terminate in cells, which are modified epi- thelial cells, and have received the name of sensory or nerve-epithelium cells. The axis- cylinder, after dividing into fibrils, ends in epithelial cells, variously modified, and to the peripheral extremity of which are often connected peculiar styliform processes. These cells will be more particularly described in the sequel, in connection with the description of the organs of special sense. Motor nerves are to be traced either into unstriped or striped muscular fibres. In the unstriped or involuntary muscles the nerves are derived from the sympa- thetic, and are composed mainly of the non-medullated fibres. Near their termi- nation they divide into a number of branches, which communicate and form an intimate plexus. At the junction of the branches small triangular nuclear bodies are situated. From these plexuses minute branches are given off, which divide and break up into the ultimate fibrillae of which the nerve is composed. These fibrillin course between the involuntary muscle-cells, and, according to Elischer, terminate on the surface of the cell, opposite the nucleus, in a minute swelling. Arnold and Frankenhauser believed that these ultimate fibrillae penetrated the muscular cell, and ended in the nucleus. More recent observation has, however, tended to disprove this. In the striped or voluntary muscle, the nerves supplying the muscular fibres are derived from the cerebro-spinal nerves, and are composed mainly of medullated fibres. The nerve, after entering the sheath of the muscle, breaks up into fibres, or bundles of fibres, which form plexuses, and gradually divide until, as a rule, a single nerve-fibre enters a single muscular fibre. Sometimes, however, if the muscular fibre is loni?, more than one nerve-fibre enters it. Within the .

The nerves supplying tendons have peculiar nerve-endings, and are especially numerous near the point where the tendon becomes muscular. In this situation spindle-shaped bodies are found, and are known as the organs of Golgi. They are apparently composed of several tendinous bundles, fused into one, into which one or more nerve-fibres pass, and, dividing, spread out between the tendon-bundles.

The same as seen two hours after death from poisoning by curare. Nerve-fibres occasionally terminate in tendons as end-bulbs or as small Pacinian corpuscles. The Ganglia may be regarded as separate and independent nervous centres, of smaller size and less complex structure than the brain, connected with each other, with the cerebro-spinal axis, and with the nerves in various situations. They are found on the posterior root of each of the spinal nerves ; on the posterior or sensory root of the fifth cranial nerve ; on the facial and auditory nerves ; on the glosso- pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves; and on the branches of certain spinal nerves. They are also found in a connected series along each side of the vertebral column, forming the trunk of the sympathetic ; and on the branches of that nerve, generally in the plexuses or at the point of junction of two or more nerves with each other, or with branches of the cerebro-spinal system. On section they are seen to consist of a reddish-grey substance, traversed by numerous white nerve- fibres ; they vary considerably in form and size ; the largest are found in the cavity of the abdomen ; the smallest, not visible to the naked eye, exist in consider- able numbers upon the nerves distributed to the difierent viscera. The ganglia are invested by a smooth and firm, closely-adhering, membranous envelope, consisting of dense areolar tissue ; this sheath is continuous with the perineurium of the nerves, and sends numerous processes into the interior of the ganglion, which support the blood-vessels supplying its substance. * They had, however, previously been noticed, though not accurately described, by Boyere, who named them ' nerve-hillocks.'48 GENEKAL ANATOMY In structure all ganglia are essentially similar (fig. 56), consisting of the same structural elements as the other nervous centres—viz. a collection of vesicular nervous matter traversed by tubular and gelpiinous nerve-fibres. The vesicular nervous matter consists of nerve or ganglion cells, most of which appear to be free and of a round or oval form; these are more especially seated near the surface of the gan- glion ; others are unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar, and their caudate processes give origin to nerve-fibres. In the ganglion the nerve-cells are usually enclosed in a transparent capsule with nuclei on its inner surface. The nerve-fibres on en- tering the ganglion lay aside their perineurium, which becomes con- tinuous with the capsule. Some of the fibres run through the gan- glion without being connected with the cells, others arise from the cau- date processes of the cells. A remarkable modification of the bipolar nerve-cell is found in the sympathetic ganglia, especially in the frog, but also in some few instances in the mammal. The cells are pear-shaped, and from the narrovNT end two processes arise: one a straight axis-cylinder process, into which the substance of the ganglion is prolonged; the other, a thin fibre, winds spirally round the straight fibre, and then passes away from the cell in the opposite direction and becomes invested with a medullary sheath and neurilemma of its own, and constitutes a medullated fibre, while the straight axis-cylinder process forms a non-medullated fibre. THE VASCULAR SYSTEM The Vascular System, exclusive of its central organ, the heart, is divided into four classes of vessels: the arteries, capillaries, veins, and lymphatics; the minute structure of which we will now proceed briefly to describe, referring the reader to the body of the work for all that is necessary in the details of their ordinary anatomy. Structure of Arteries (fig. 57).—The arteries are composed of three coats: internal or endothelial coat {tunica intima of Kolliker) ; middle muscular coat (tunica media) ; and external cellular coat [tunica adventitia). The two inner coats together are very easily separated from the external, as by the ordinary operation of tying a ligature on an artery. If a fine string be tied forcibly upon an artery and then taken off, the external coat will be found un- divided, but the internal coats are divided in the track of the ligature and can easily be further dissected from the outer coat. The inner coat can be separated from the middle by a little maceration, or it may be stripped off in small pieces ; but, on account of its friability, it cannot be separated as a complete membrane. It is ! a fine, transparent, colourless structure which is highly elastic, and is commonly corrugated into longitudinal wrinkles. The inner coat consists of—i. A layer of, pavement-epithelium, the cells of which are polygonal, oval, or fusiform, and have very distinct round or oval nuclei. This endothelium, as it is now generally called, Fig. 56.—Section through a microscoi^ic ganglion. Magnified 300 diameters. (Klein and Noble Smith.) c. Capsule of the ganglion, n.

A sub- epithelial layer, consisting of delicate connective tissue with branched cells lying in the interspaces of the tissue. 3. An elastic or fenestrated layer, which con- sists of an elastic membrane contain- ing a network of elastic fibres, having Fiq.. 57._Transverse section through a principally a longitudinal direction and in which, under the microscope, small, elongated apertures or perforations may be seen, giving it a fenestrated appear- ance. It was therefore called by Henle the fenestrated membrane. This mem- brane forms the chief thickness of the inner coat, and can be separated into several layers, some of which present the appearance of a network of longi- tudinal elastic fibres, and others present a more membranous character, marked by pale lines having a longitudinal direc- tion. In arteries of less than a line in diameter the subepithelial layer consists of a single layer of stellate cells, and the connective tissue is only largely developed in the large-sized vessels. The fenestrated membrane in microscopic arteries is a i very thin layer, but in the larger arteries, and especially in the aorta, it has a very considerable thickness. The middle coat [tunica media) is dis- tinguished from the inner by its colour and by the transverse arrangement of its fibres, in contradistinction to the longitudinal direction of those of the inner coat. It consists of two varieties of structure, yelloio elastic tissue and mnscular tissue, which are present in varying quantities in different vessels, according to their size, j the former tissue preponderating in the ■ larger vessels and the latter in the smaller I ones. In the largest arteries this coat is of great thickness, of a yellow colour, and highly elastic; it diminishes in thick- ness and becomes redder in colour as the arteries become smaller, and finally 1 becomes very thin and disappears. In small arteries this coat is purely muscular, I consisting of muscle fibre-cells (fig. 44) united to form lamellae which vary in number according to the size of the artery ; the very small arteries having only a single layer, and those not larger than one tenth of a line in diameter three or four layers. In arteries of medium size (fig. 58) this coat becomes thicker in proportion to the size of the vessel; its layers of muscular tissue are more numerous and I intermixed with numerous fine elastic fibres which unite to form broad-meshed net- i works. In the larger vessels, as the femoral, superior mesenteric, coeliac axis, external iliac, brachial and popliteal arteries, the elastic fibres unite to form lamellae, which alternate with the layers of muscular fibre. In the largest arteries the muscular tissue is only slightly developed and forms about one-third or one- I fourth of the whole substance of the middle coat; this is especially the case in the aorta and trunk of the pulmonary artery, in which the individual cells of the muscular layer are imperfectly formed, while in the carotid, axillary, iliac, and subclavian arteries the muscular layer of the middle coat is more developed.

They are most distinct and arranged with greatest regularity in the abdominal aorta, innominate artery, and common carotid. In the larger arteries bundles of white connective-tissue fibres have also been found in small quantity in the middle coat. The external coat {tunica adventitia) consists mainly of fine and closely felted bundles of white connective tissue, but also contains elastic fibres in all but the smallest arteries. The elastic tissue is much more abundant next the tunica media, and it is sometimes described as forming here, between the adventitia and media, a special layer, the tunica elastica externa of Henle. This layer is most marked in arteries of medium size. In the largest vessels the external coat is relatively thin ; but in small arteries it is as thick or thicker than the middle coat. In the smaller arteries it consists of a single layer of white connective tissue and elastic fibres; while in the smallest arteries, just above the capillaries, the elastic fibres are wanting, and the connective tissue, of which the coat is composed, becomes more homogeneous the nearer it approaches the capillaries, and is gradually reduced to a thin membranous envelope, which finally disappears. Some arteries have ex- tremely thin coats in pro- portion to their size ; this is especially the case in those situated in the cavity of the cranium and spinal canal, the difference de- pending on the greater thinness of the external and middle coats. The arteries, in their distribution throughout the body, are included in a thin fibro-areolar investment, which forms what is called their sheath. In the limbs this is usually formed by a prolongation of the deep fascia ; in the upper part of the thigh it consists of a continuation downwards of the transversalis and iliac fasciae of the abdomen ; in the neck, of a prolongation of the deep cervical fascia. The included vessel is loosely connected with its sheath by a delicate areolar tissue; and the sheath usually encloses the accompanying veins, and sometimes a nerve. Some arteries, as those in the cranium, are not included in sheaths. All the larger arteries are supplied with blood-vessels like the other organs of the body ; they are called the vasa vasorum. These nutrient vessels arise from a branch of the artery or from a neighbouring vessel, at some considerable distance from the point at which they are distributed ; they ramify in the loose areolar tissue connecting the artery with its sheath, and are distributed to the external coat, but do not, in man, penetrate the other coats; though in some of the larger mammals some feAv vessels have been traced into the middle coat. Minute veins serve to return the blood from these vessels ; they empty themselves into the venae comites in connection with the artery. Lymphatic vessels and lymphatic spaces are also present in the outer coat. Arteries are also supplied with nerves, which are derived chiefly from the sym- pathetic, but partly from the cerebro-spinal system. They form intricate plexuses upon the surfaces of the larger trunks, and run along the smaller branches as single Fig. 58.

The branches derived from these plexuses penetrate the external coat and are principally distributed to the muscular tissue of the middle coat, and thus regulate, by causing the contraction and relaxation of this tissue, the amount of blood sent to any part. The Capillaries.—The smaller arterial branches (excepting those of the caver- nous structure of the sexual organs, of the spleen, and in the uterine placenta) terminate in a network of vessels which pervade nearly every tissue of the body. These vessels, from their minute size, are termed capillaries {cajjillus, a ' hair'), They are interposed between the smallest branches of the arteries and the com- mencing veins, constituting a network, the branches of which maintain the same diameter throughout; the meshes of the network being more uniform in shape and size than those formed by the anastomoses of the small arteries and veins. The diameter of the capillaries varies in the different tissues of the body, their usual size being about 3 oVo of an inch. The smallest are those of the brain, and the mucous membrane of the intestines ; and the largest those of the skin and the marrow of bone, where they are stated to be as large as xsVo of an inch. The form of the capillary net varies in the different tissues, the meshes being generally rounded or elongated. The rounded form of mesh is most common, and prevails where there is a dense network, as in the lungs, in most glands and mucous membranes, and in the cutis ; here the meshes are more or less angular, sometimes nearly quadrangular, or polygonal ; more frequently irregular. Elongated meshes are observed in the bundles of fibres and tubes composing muscles and nerves, the meshes being usually of a parallelogram form, the long axis of the mesh running parallel with the long axis of the nerve and fibre. Some- times the capillaries have a looped arrangement; a single vessel projecting from the common network and returning after forming one or more loops, as in the papillae of the tongue and skin. The number of the capillaries, and the size of the meshes, determine the degree of vascularity of a part. The closest network and the smallest interspaces are found in the lungs and in the choroid coat of the eye. In these situations the interspaces are smaller than the capillary vessels them- selves. In the kidney, in the conjunctiva, and in the cutis the interspaces are from three to four times as large as the capillaries which form them ; and in the brain from eight to ten times as large as the capillaries in their long diameter, and from four to six times as large in their transverse diameter. In the adventitia of arteries the width of the meshes is ten times that of the capillary vessels. As a general rule, the more active the function of the organ, the closer is its capillary net and the larger its supply of blood ; the network being very narrow in all growing parts, in the glands and in the mucous membranes ; wider in bones and ligaments, which are comparatively inactive; and nearly altogether absent in jtendons, in which very little organic change occurs after their formation. J Structure.—The walls of the capillaries consist of a fine, transparent, endothelial [layer, composed of cells joined edge to edge by an interstitial cement-substance, and continuous with the endothelial cells which line the arteries and veins. When stained with nitrate of silver the edges which bound the endothelial cells are brought into view (fig. 59). These cells are of large size and of an irregular poly- jgonal or lanceolate shape, each containing an oval nucleus which may be brought into view by carmine or logwood. Between their edges, at various points of their meeting, roundish dark spots are sometimes seen, which have been described as stomata, though they are closed by intercellular substance. They have been believed to be the situation through which the white corpuscles of the blood, when ^migrating through the blood-vessels, emerge ; but this view, though x^robable, is not aniversally accepted. In many situations a delicate sheath or envelope of branched nucleated connective tissue cells is found around the simple capillary tube, particularly in the larger i3nes; and in other places, especially in the glands, the capillaries are invested with retiform lymphatic tissue ; and again, in other situations, as the pia mater of B 252 GENERAL ANATOMY the brain and cord, and in the retina, the capillaries are invested with a sheath composed of a delicate endothelial membrane. In the largest capillaries (which ought, perhaps, to be described rather as the smallest arteries) there is, outside the endothelial layer, a muscular layer, consisting of contractile fibre-cells, arranged transversely, as in the tunica media of the larger arteries (fig. 60). The veins, like the arteries, are composed of three coats—internal, middle, and external: and these coats are, with the necessary modifications, analogous to the coats of the arteries ; the mternal being the endothelial, the middle the muscular, and the external the connective or areolar. The main difference between the veins and the arteries is in the comparative weakness of the middle coat of the former, and to this it is due that the veins do not stand open when divided, as Fig. 60.—Finest vessels on the arterial side.

In the veins immediately above the capillaries the three coats are hardly to be distinguished. The endothelium is supported on an outer membrane separable into two layers, the outer of which is the thicker, and consists of a delicate, nucleated membrane (adventitia), while the inner is composed of a network of longitudinal elastic fibres (media). In the veins next above these in size (one-fifth of a line according to Kolliker) a muscular layer and a layer of circular fibres can be traced, forming the middle coat, while the elastic and connective elements of the outer coat become more distinctly perceptible. In the middle-sized veins the typical structure of these vessels becomes clear. The endothelium is of the same character as in the arteries, but its cells are more oval, less fusiform. It is supported by a connective-tissue layer, consisting of a delicate network of branched cells, and external to this is a layer of longitudinal elastic fibres, but seldom any appearance of a fenestrated membrane. This constitutes the internal coat. The middle coat is composed of a thick layer of connective tissue with elastic fibres, intermixed, in someTHE VASCULAR SYSTEM 53 veins, with a transverse layer of muscular fibres. The white fibrous element is in considerable excess, and the elastic fibres are in much smaller proportion in the veins than in the arteries. The outer coat consists of areolar tissue, as in the arteries, with longitudinal elastic fibres. In the largest veins the outer coat is from two to five times thicker than the middle coat, and contains a large number of longitudinal muscular fibres. This is most distinct in the inferior vena cava, and at the termination of this vein in the heart, in the trunks of the hepatic veins, in all the large trunks of the vena portas, in the splenic, superior mesenteric, external iliac, renal and azygos veins. In the renal and portal veins it extends through the whole thickness of the outer coat, but in the other veins mentioned a layer of connective and elastic tissue is found external to the muscular fibres. All the large veins which open into the heart are covered for a short distance with a layer of striped muscular tissue continued on to them from the heart. Muscular tissue is wanting in the veins—(i) of the maternal part of the placenta ; (2) in the venous sinuses of the dura mater and the veins of the pia mater of the brain and spinal cord; (3) in the veins of the retina; (4) in the veins of the cancellous tissue of bones ; (5) in the venous spaces of the corpora cavernosa. The veins of the above- mentioned parts consist of an internal endothelial lining supported on one or more layers of areolar tissue. The internal and external jugular veins and the subclavian vein are said to contain either no muscular fibres at all, or at all events only a slight amount in their middle coat. Most veins are provided with valves, which serve to prevent the reflux of the blood. They are formed by a reduphcation of the inner coat, strengthened by con- nective tissue and elastic fibres, and are covered on both surfaces with endothelium, the arrangement of which differs on the two surfaces. On the surface of the valve next the wall of the vein, the cells are arranged transversely; whilst on the other surface, over which the current of blood flows, the cells are arranged vertically in the direction of the current. Their form is semilunar. They are attached by their convex edge to the wall of the vein ; the concave margin is free, directed in the course of the venous current, and lies in close apposition with the wall of the vein as long as the current of blood takes its natural course ; if, however, any regurgi- tation takes place, the valves become distended, their opposed edges are brought into contact, and the current is intercepted. Most commonly two such valves are found placed opposite one another, more especially in the smaller veins or in the larger trunks at the point where they are joined by smaller branches ; occasionally there are three and sometimes only one. The wall of the vein on the cardiac side of the point of attachment of each segment of the valve is expanded into a pouch or sinus, which gives to the vessel, when injected or distended with blood, a knotted appearance. The valves are very numerous in the veins of the extremities, espe- cially of the lower extremities, these vessels having to conduct the blood against the force of gravity. They are absent in the very small veins, i.e. those less than of an inch in diameter, also in the venae cav^e, the hepatic veins, portal vein and its branches, the renal, uterine, and ovarian veins. A few valves are found in the spermatic veins, and one also at their point of junction with the renal vein and inferior vena cava in both sexes. The cerebral and spinal veins, the veins of the cancellated tissue of bone, the pulmonary veins, and the umbilical vein and its branches, are also destitute of valves. They are occasionally found, few in number, in the vense azygos and intercostal veins. The veins are supplied with nutrient vessels, vasa vasorwn, hke the arteries. Nerves also are distributed to them, in the same manner as to the arteries, but in much less abundance. The lymphatic vessels, including in this term the lacteal vessels, which are identical in structure with them, are composed of three coats. The internal is an endothelial and elastic coat. It is thin, transparent, slightly elastic, and ruptures sooner than the other coats. It is composed of a layer of elongated epithelial cells with serrated margins, by which the adjacent cells are dovetailed into one another. These are supported on a single layer of longitudinal elasticGENERAL ANATOMY 54 fibres. The middle coat is composed of smooth muscular and fine elastic fibres, disposed in a transverse direction. The external, or fibro-areolar, coat con- sists of filaments of connective tissue, intermixed with smooth muscular fibres, longitudinally or obliquely dis- posed. It forms a protective covering to the other coats, and serves to con- nect the vessel with the neighbouring structures. The above description applies only to the larger lymphatics ; in the smaller vessels there is no muscular or elastic coat, and their structure consists only of a connective- tissue coat, lined by endothelium. The thoracic duct (fig. 6i) is a somewhat more complex structure than the other Fig. 61.-—Transverse section through the coats of the thoracic duct of man. Magnified 30 times. '^^^^^^^^ I.

The lymphatics are supplied by nutrient vessels, which are distributed to their outer and middle coats ; but no nerves have at present been traced into them. The lymphatics are very generally X3rovided with valves, which assist materially in effecting the circulation of the fluid they contain. These valves are formed of a thin layer of fibrous tissue, lined on both surfaces by endothelium. Their form is semilunar ; they are attached by their convex edge to the sides of the vessel, the concave edge being free and directed along the course of the contained current. Usually two such valves, of equal size, are found opposite one another; but occa- sionally exceptions occur, especially at or near the anastomoses of lymphatic vessels. Thus, one valve may be of very rudimentary size and the other increased in proportion. The valves in the lymphatic vessels are placed at much shorter intervals than in the veins. They are most numerous near the lymphatic glands, and they are found more frequently in the lymphatics of the neck and upper extremity than in the lower. The wall of the lymphatics immediately above the point of attachment of each segment of a valve is expanded into a pouch or sinus, which gives to these vessels, when distended, the knotted or beaded appearance which they present. Valves are wanting in the vessels composing the plexiform network in which the lymphatics usually originate on the surface of the body. Origin of Lymphatics.—The finest visible lymphatic vessels (lymphatic capil- laries) form a ]3lexiform network in the tissues and organs, and they consist of a single layer of endothelial plates, with more or less sinuous margins. These vessels commence in an intercommunicating system of clefts or spaces in the connective tissue of the diflerent organs, which have no complete endothelial lining. They55 THE VASCULAK SYSTEM have been named the rootlets of the lymphatics, and are identical with the spaces in which the connective-tissue corpuscles are contained. This then is properly regarded as one method of their commencement, when the lymphatic vessels are apparently continuous with spaces in the connective tissue, and Klein has described and figured a direct communication between these spaces and the lymphatic vessel.* But the lymphatics have also other modes of origin, for the intestinal lacteals commence by closed extremities, though some observers believe that the closed extremity is continuous with a minute network contained in the substance of the villus, through which the lacteal is connected wath the epithelial cells covering it. Again, it seems now to be conclusively proved that the serous membranes present stomata or openings between the epithelial cells (fig. 62) by which there is an open communication with the lymphatic system and through which the lymph is thought to be pumped by the ultimate dilatation and contraction of the serous surface, due to the movements of respiration and circulation,! so that the serous and synovial sacs may be regarded, in a certain sense, as large lymph cavities or sinuses. Von Recklinghausen was the first to observe the passage of milk and other coloured fluids through these stomata on the peritoneal surface of the central tendon of the diaphragm. Again, in most glandular structures the lymphatic capillaries have a lacunar origin. Here they begin in irregular clefts or spaces in the tissue of the part; occupying the penetrating connective tissue and surrounding the lacunae or tubules of the gland, and in many places separating the capillary network from the alveolus or tubule, so that the interchange between the blood and the secreting cells of the part must be carried on through this lymph- space or lacuna. Closely allied to this is the mode of origin of lymphatics in perivascular and perineural spaces. Sometimes a minute artery may be seen to be ensheathed for a certain distance by a lymphatic capillary vessel, which is often many times wider than a blood capillary. These are known as perivascular lymphatics. Terminations of lymphatics.—The lymphatics, including the lacteals, discharge tiheir contents into the veins at two points ; namely, at the angles of junction of the subclavian and internal jugular veins : on the left side by means of the thoracic duct, and on the right side by the right lymphatic duct. (See description of lymphatics on a subsequent page.) Lymphatic glands [conglobate glands) are small oval or bean-shaped bodies, situated in the course of lymphatic and lacteal vessels, so that the lymph and chyle pass through them on their way to the blood. They generally present on one side a slight depression—the hilum—through which the blood-vessels enter and leave the interior. The efferent lymphatic vessel also emerges from the gland at this spot, while the afferent vessels enter the organ at different parts of the periphery. On section (fig. 63), a lymphatic gland displays two different structures: an external, of lighter colour—the cortical; and an internal, darker—the medullary. The cortical structure does not form a complete investment, but is deficient at the hilum, where the medullary portion reaches the surface of the gland ; so that the efferent vessel is derived directly from the medullary structure, while the afferent vessels empty themselves into the cortical substance. Lymphatic glands consist of (i) a fibrous envelope, or capsule, from which a framework of processes (trabeculce) proceed inwards, dividing the gland into open spaces (alveoli) freely communicating with each other ; (2) a quantity of adenoid tissue occupying these spaces without completely filling them ; (3) a free supply of blood-vessels, which are supported on the trabeculce ; and (4) the afferent and efferent vessels. Little is known of the nerves, though KoUiker describes some fine nervous filaments passing into the hilum. The capsule is composed of a layer of connective tissue, and from its internal * Atlas of Histology, pi. viii. fig. xiv. t The resemblance between lymph and serum led Hewson long ago to regard the serous cavities as sacs into which the lymphatics open. Eecent microscopic discoveries confirm this opinion in a very interesting manner.56 GENEEAL ANATOMY 111 man, Fig. 63.—Section of small lymphatic gland, half-diagrammatically given, with the course of the lymph. surface are given off a number of membranous septa or lamellae, consisting of connective tissue, with a small admixture of muscular fibre-cells; but in many of the lower animals composed almost entirely of involuntary muscular fibre. They pass inwards, radiating towards the centre of the gland, for a certain distance, that is to say, for about one-third or one-fourth of the space between the circum- ference and the centre of the gland. They thus divide the outer part of its interior into a number of oval compartments or alveoli (fig. 63) . This is the cortical por- tion of the gland. After having penetrated into the gland for some distance, these septa break up into a number of smaller trabeculse, which form flattened bands or cords, interlacing with each other in all directions, forming in the central part of the organ a number of inter- communicating spaces, also called alveoli. This is the medullary por- tion of the gland, and the spaces or alveoli in it not only freely com- municate with each other, but also with the alveoli of the cortical por- tion. In these alveoli or spaces (fig. 64) is contained the proper gland- substance or lymphoid tissue. The gland-pulp does not, howevei:, completely fill the alveolar spaces, but leaves, between its outer margin and the trabecule forming the alveoli, a channel or space of uniform width throughout. This is termed the Fig. 64.—Follicle from a lymphatic gland of the dog, in vertical section. <t. The envelope, b. Septa between the follicles or alveoli of the cortical part. c.

Running across it are a number of trabecul^e of retiform connective tissue, the fibres of which are, for the most part, covered byTHE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES 57 ramified cells. This tissue appears to serve the purpose of maintaining the gland- pulp in the centre of the space in its proper position. On account of the peculiar arrangement of the framework of the organ, the gland-pulp in the cortical portion is disposed in the form of nodules, and in the medullary part in the form of rounded cords. It consists of ordinary lymphoid tissue, being made up of a delicate reticulum of retiform tissue, which is continuous with that in the lymph-]3aths, but marked off from it by a closer reticulation; in its meshes are closely packed lymph-corpuscles, traversed by a dense plexus of capillary blood-vessels. The ajferent vessels, as above stated, enter at all parts of the periphery of the gland, and after branching and forming a dense plexus in the substance of the capsule open into the lymph-sinuses of the cortical part. In doing this, they lose all their coats except their endothelial lining, which is continuous with a layer of similar cells lining the lymph-paths. In like manner the efferent vessel commences from the lymph-sinuses of the medullary portion. The stream of lymph carried to the gland by the afferent vessel thus passes through the plexus in the capsule to the lymph-paths of the cortical portion, where it is exposed to the action of the gland-pulp ; flowing through these it enters the paths or sinuses of the medullary portion, and finally emerges from the hilum by -means of the efferent vessel. The stream of lymph in its passage through the lymph-sinuses is much retarded by the presence of the reticulum. Hence morphological elements, either normal or morbid, are easily arrested and de- posited in the sinuses. This is a matter of con- siderable importance in connection with the subject of poisoned wounds and the absorption of the poison by the lymphatic system, since by this means septic organisms carried along the - lymphatic vessels may be arrested in the lymph- sinuses of the gland-tissue, and thus be prevented from entering the general circulation. The arteries of the gland enter at the hilum and either pass at once to the gland-pulp, to break up into a capillary plexus, or else run along the trabeculaB, partly to supply them and partly running across the lymph-paths to assist in forming the capillary plexus of the gland-pulp. This plexus traverses the lymphoid tissue, but does not pass into the lymph-sinuses. From it the veins commence and emerge from the organ at the same place as that at which the artery enters. THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES The skin (fig. 67) is the principal seat of the sense of touch, and may be regarded as a covering for the protection of the deeper tissues ; it is also an important excretory and absorbing organ. It consists principally of a layer of vascular tissue, named the derma, corvum, or cutis vera, and an external covering of epithelium, termed the epidermis or cuticle. On the surface of the former layer are the sensi- tive ; and within, or embedded beneath it, are certain organs with special functions, namely, the sioeat-glands, hair-follicles, and sebaceous glands.

Capillary plexus.GENERAL ANATOMY The epidermis or cuticle {scarf-skin, fig. 68) is an epithelial structure belonging to the class of stratified epithelium. It is accurately moulded on the papillary layer of the derma. It forms a defensive covering to the surface of the true skin, and limits the evaporation of watery vapour from its free surface. It varies in thickness in different parts. In some situations, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, it is thick, hard, and horny in texture. This may be partly due to the fact that these parts are exposed to intermittent pressure, but that this is not the only cause is proved by the fact that the condition exists to a very considerable extent at birth. The Fig. 67.—A sectional view of the skin (magnified). Suhcii- tcnieous cellidar tissue Sir eat qlands more superficial layer of cells, called the horny layer {stratum corneum) may be separated by maceration from the deeper layers, which are called the rete mu- cosum, and which con- sist of several layers of differently shaped cells. The free surface of the epidermis is marked by a network of linear fur- ro^vs of variable size, marking out the surface into a number of spaces of polygonal or lozenge- shaped form. Some of these furrows are large, as opposite the flexures of the joints, and cor- respond to the folds in the derma produced by their movements. In other situations, as upon the back of the hand, they are exceedingly fine, and intersect one another at various angles; upon the pal- mar surface of the hand and fingers, and upon the sole of the foot, these lines are very distinct, and are disposed in curves. They depend upon the large size and peculiar arrangement of the papillse upon which the epidermis is placed. The deep surface of the epidermis is accurately moulded upon the papillary layer of the derma, each papilla being invested by its epidermic sheath; so that when this layer is removed by macera- tion, it presents on its under surface a number of pits or depressions corresponding to the elevations in the papillae, as well as the ridges left in the intervals between them. Fine tubular prolongations are continued from this layer into the ducts of the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands. In structure, the epidermis consists of several layers of' epithelial cells, aggiu- , tinated together and having a laminated arrangement. These several layers may ^ be described as composed of four different strata from within outwards : (i) the i rete Malpighii, composed of several layers of epithelial cells, of which the deepest layer is elongated in figure and placed perpendicularly on the surface of the corium, their lower ends being denticulate, to fit into corresponding denticula- tions of the true skin; while the succeeding laminae consist of cells of a mor^ rounded or polyhedral form, the contents of which are soft, opaque, granular, anc I*59 THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES soluble in acetic acid. They are often marked on their surfaces with ridges and furrows, and are covered with numerous fibrils, which connect the surfaces of the . cells : these are known di.^ prickle cells (see page ii). (2) Immediately superficial to these is a single layer of flattened, spindle-shaped cells, the granular layer, which contain granules that become deeply stained in hgematoxylin. They are supposed to be cells in a transitional stage between the protoplasmic cells of the rete Malpighii I and the horny cells of the superficial layers. (3) Above this layer, the cells become indistinct, and appear, in sections, to form a homogeneous or dimly striated mem- i brane, composed of closely packed scales, in which traces of a flattened nucleus may be found. It is called the stratum lucidum. (4) As these cells successively approach the surface by the development of fresh layers from beneath, they assume a flattened jform, from the evaporation of their fluid contents, and consist of many layers of horny epithelial scales in which no nucleus is discernible, forming the stratum corneum. These cells apparently become changed in their chemical composition, as they are now unaffected by acetic acid. The deepest layer of the rete Malpighii lis separated from the papillae by an apparently homogeneous basement membrane, which is most distinctly brought into view in specimens prepared with chloride of gold. This, according to Klein, is merely the deepest portion of the epithelium.

The black colour of the skin in the negro, ind the tawny colour among some of the white races, is due to the presence of [pigment in the cells of the cuticle. This pigment is more especially distinct in the cells of the deeper layer, or rete mucosum, and is similar to that found in the cells of the pigmentary layer of the retina. As the cells approach the surface and desiccate, the colour becomes partially lost. The derma, corium, or cutis vera, is tough, flexible, and highly elastic, in order to defend the parts beneath from violence. It varies in thickness, from a quarter of a line to a line and a half, in different parts of the body. Thus it is very thick in the palms of the hands and soles of the :"eet; thicker on the posterior aspect of the body than the front, and on the outer :han the inner side of the limbs. In the eyelids, scrotum, and penis it is exceed- ngly thin and delicate. The skin generally is thicker in the male than in the "emale, and in the adult than in the child. ! The corium consists of fibrous connective tissue, with a large admixture of elastic fibres and numerous blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The fibro- ireolar tissue forms the framework of the cutis, and is differently arranged in lifferent parts, so that it is usual to describe it as consisting of two layers : theGENERAL ANATOMY 6o deeper or reticular layer, and the superficial or iKt]jillary layer. Unstriped muscular fibres are found in the superficial layers of the corium, wherever hairs are found; and in the subcutaneous areolar tissue of the scrotum, penis, labia majora of the female, and the nipples. In the latter situation the fibres are arranged in bands, closely reticulated and disposed in superimposed laminae. The reticular layer consists of strong interlacing fibrous bands, composed chiefly of the white variety of fibrous tissue, but containing, also, some fibres of the yellow elastic tissue, which vary in amount in different parts, and connective- tissue corpuscles, which are often to be found flattened against the white fibrous tissue bundles. Towards the attached surface the fasciculi are large and coarse, and the areolae which are left by their interlacement are large, and occupied by adipose tissue and sweat-glands. Below this the elements of the skin become gradually blended with the subcutaneous areolar tissue, which, except in a few situations, contains fat. Towards the free surface the fasciculi are much finer, and their mode of interlacing close and intricate. The papillary layer is situated upon the free surface of the reticular layer; it consists of numerous small, highly sensitive, and vascular eminences, the papillcR, which rise perpendicularly from its surface, and form the essential element of the organ of touch. The papillte are conical-shaped eminences, having a round or blunted extremity, occasionally divided into two or more parts and connected by a thin base with the free surface of the corium. Their average length is about of an inch, and they measure at their base o^l-jy of an inch in diameter. On the general surface of the body, more especially in those parts which are endowed with slight sensibility, they are few in number, short, exceedingly minute, and irregu- larly scattered over the surface ; but in some situations, as upon the palmar surface of the hands and fingers, upon the plantar surface of the feet and toes, and around the nipple, they are long, of large size, closely aggregated together, and arranged in parallel curved lines, forming the elevated ridges seen on the free surface of the epidermis. In these ridges the larger papillae are arranged in a double row, with smaller papillae between them; and these rows are subdivided into small square- shaped spaces by short transverse furrows, regularly disposed ; in the centre of each of these transverse furrows is the minute orifice of the duct of a sweat-gland. No papillae exist in the grooves between the ridges. In structure the papillae consist of very small and closely interlacing bundles of finely fibrillated tissue, with a few elastic fibres. The arteries supplying the skin form a network in the subcutaneous tissue, from which branches are given off to supply the sweat-glands, the hair-follicles, and the fat. Other branches are given off which form a plexus immediately beneath the corium ; from this, fine capillary vessels pass into the papillae, forming, in the smaller papillae, a single capillary loop, but in the larger, a more or less convoluted vessel. There are numerous lymphatics supplied to the skin, which form two networks, superficial and deep, communicating with each other and with those of the subcutaneous tissue by oblique branches. They originate in the cell- spaces of the tissue. The nerves of the skin terminate partly in the epidermis and partly in the cutis vera. The former form a dense plexus in the superficial layer of the corium, which extends horizontally and gives off numerous fibrils ; these are prolonged into the epidermis and terminate between the cells, either in bulbous extremities or in a network; or, according to more recent observations, in the deep epithelial cells themselves. The latter terminate in end-bulbs, touch-corpuscles, or Pacinian bodies, in the manner already described ; and, in addition to these, a considerable number of fibrils are distributed to the hair-follicles, which are said to entivine the follicle in a circula-r manner. Other nerve-fibres are supplied to the plain mus- cular tissues of the hair-muscles (arrectores pili) and to the muscular coat of the j blood-vessels. These are probably non-medullated fibres. j The appendages of the skin are the nails, the hairs, the sudoriferous and] sebaceous glands, and their ducts.THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES 6i The nails and hairs are pecuHar modifications of the epidermis, consisting essentially of the same cellular structure as that tissue. The nails are flattened, elastic structures of a horny texture, placed upon the dorsal surface of the terminal phalanges of the fingers and toes. Each nail is convex on its outer surface, concave within, and is implanted by a portion, called the root, into a groove in the skin ; the exposed portion is called the hody, and the anterior extremity the free edge. The nail has a very firm adhesion to the cutis, being accurately moulded upon its surface, as the epidermis is in other parts. The part of the cutis beneath the body and root of the nail is called the matrix, because it is the part from which the nail is produced. Corresponding to the body of the nail, the matrix is thick, and covered with large, highly vascular papilla, arranged in longitudinal rows, the colour of which is seen through the transparent tissue. Behind this, near the root of the nail, the papillfe are small, less vascular, and have no regular arrangement, and here the tissue of the nail is somewhat more opaque ; hence this portion is of a whiter colour, and is called the lunula on account of its shape. The cuticle, as it passes forwards on the dorsal surface of the finger or toe, is attached to the surface of the nail, a little in advance of its root; at the extremity of the finger it is connected with the under surface of the nail a little behind its free edge. The cuticle and horny substance of the nail (both epidermic structures) are thus directly continuous with each other. The nails, in structure, consist of cells having a laminated arrangement, and these are essentially similar to those composing the epidermis. The deepest layer of cells, which lie in contact with the papillae of the matrix, are of elongated form, arranged perpendicularly to the surface and provided with nuclei; those which succeed them are of a rounded or polygonal form, the more superficial ones becoming broad, thin, and flattened, and so closely compacted as to make the limits of each cell very indistinct. It is by the successive growth of new cells at the root and under surface of the body of the nail that it advances forwards and maintains a due thickness, whilst, at the same time, the growth of the nail in the proper direction is secured. As these cells in their turn become displaced by the growth of new cells, they assume a flattened form, lose their nuclei, and finally become closely compacted together into a firm, dense, horny texture. In chemical comjjosition the nails resemble epidermis. According to Mulder, they contain a somewhat larger proportion of carbon and sulphur. The hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, and consist essentially of the same structure as that membrane. They are found on nearly every part of the surface of the body, excepting the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and the penis. They vary much in length, thickness, and colour in different parts of the body and in difterent races of mankind. In some parts, as in the skin of the eye- lids, they are so short as not to project beyond the follicles containing them; in other parts, as upon the scalp, they are of considerable length : again, in other parts, as the eyelashes, the hairs- of the pubic region, and the male whiskers and beard, they are remarkable for their thickness. The hairs generally present a cylindrical or more or less flattened form and a reniform outline upon transverse section. A hair consists of a root, the part implanted in the skin; the shaft or stem, the portion projecting from its surface ; and the ijoint. The root of the hair presents at its extremity a bulbous enlargement, which is whiter in colour and softer in texture than the shaft, and is lodged in a follicular involution of the epidermis called the hair-follicle. When the hair is of consider- able length the follicle extends into the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The hair- follicle commences on the surface of the skin with a funnel-shaped opening, and passes inwards in an oblique direction to become dilated at its deep extremity, to correspond with the bulbous condition of the hair which it contains. It has opening into it, near its free extremity, the orifices of the ducts of one or more sebaceous glands (fig. 68). At the bottom of each hair-follicle is a small conical vascular eminence or papilla, similar in every respect to those found upon the62 GENERAL ANATOMY surface of the skin ; it is continuous with the dermic layer of the folhcle, is highly vascular, and probably supplied with nervous fibrils; this is the part through which material is supplied for the production and constant growth of the hair. In structure the hair-follicle consists of two coats— an outer or dermic, and an inner or epidermic. The outer or dermic coat is formed mainly of fibrous tissue ; it is continuous with the corium, is highly vascular, and supplied by numerous minute nervous filaments. It consists of three layers (fig. 69). The most internal, next the cuticular lining of the follicle, consists of a hyaline basement-membrane having a glassy, transparent appearance, which is well marked in the larger hair-follicles, but is not very distinct in the follicles of minute hairs. It is continuous with the basement-membrane of the sur- face of the corium. External to this is a layer of spindle-shaped cells, arranged in a circular manner around the follicle, but reaching only as high as the entrance of the ducts of the sebaceous glands. This is usually regarded as a muscular layer, the cells resembling unstriped muscle-cells. Externally is a thick layer of connective tissue, arranged in longi- tudinal bundles, in which are contained the blood- vessels and nerves. The inner or epidermic layer is closely adherent to the root of the hair, so that when the hair is plucked from its follicle this layer most commonly adheres to it and forms what is called the root-sheath. It consists of two strata named respectively the outer and inner root-sheath; the former of these corresponds Vvdth the Malpighian layer of the epidermis, and resembles it in the rounded form and soft character of its cells ; at the bottom of the hair-follicle these cells become continuous with those of the root of the hair. The inner root-sheath consists of a delicate cuticle next the hair; then of one or two layers of horny, flattened, nucleated cells, known as Huxley's layer ; and finally of a single layer of non-nucleated, horny, cubical cells, called Henle's layer. The hair-follicle contains the root of the hair, which terminates in a bulbous extremity, and is excavated so as to exactly fit the papilla from which it grows. The bulb is composed of polyhedral epithelial cells, which as they pass upwards into the root of the hair become elongated and spindle-shaped, except some in the centre which remain polyhedral. Some of these latter cells contain pigment- granules, which give rise to the colour of the hair. It occasionally happens that these pigment-granules completely fill the cells in the centre of the bulb, which gives rise to the dark tract of pigment often found, of greater or less length, in the axis of the hair. The shaft of the hair consists of a central pith or medulla, the fibrous part of the hair, and the cortex externally. The medulla occupies the centre of the shaft and ceases towards the point of the hair. It is usually wanting in the fine hairs covering the surface of the body, and commonly in those of the head. It is more opaque and deeper coloured when viewed by transmitted light than the fibrous part; but when viewed by reflected light it is white. It is composed of rows of poly- hedral cells, which contain air-bubbles. The fibrous portion of the hair consti- tutes the chief part of the shaft ; its cells are elongated and unite to form flattened fusiform fibres. Between the fibres are found minute spaces which contain either pigment-granules in dark hair, or minute air-bubbles in white hair. In addition to this there is also a diffused pigment contained in the fibres. The cells which form the cortex of the hair consist of a single layer which surrounds those of Fig. 69.—Transverse section of hair-follicle. I. Dermic coat of follicle. 2.

(From Quaiu's ' Anatomy,' Biesiadecki.)63 THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES the fibrous part; they are converted into thin, flat scales, having an imbricated arrangement. Connected with the hair-folhcles are minute bundles of involuntary muscular fibres, termed the arrectores pili. They arise from the superficial layer of the corium, and are inserted into the outer surface of the hair-follicle, below the entrance of the duct of the sebaceous gland. They are placed on the side towards which the hair slopes, and by their action elevate the hair (fig. 68). The sebaceous glands are small, sacculated, glandular organs, lodged in the substance of the corium. They are found in most parts of the skin, but are most abundant in the scalp and face : they are also very numerous around the apertures of the anus, nose, mouth, and external ear; but are wanting in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Each gland consists of a single duct, more or less capacious, which terminates in a cluster of small secreting pouches or saccules. The sacculi connected with each duct vary, as a rule, in numbers from two to five, but, in some instances, may be as many as twenty. They are composed of a trans- parent, colourless membrane, enclosing a number of cells. Of these, the outer layer or marginal cells are small, polyhedral, epithelial cells, continuous with the lining cells of the duct. The remainder of the sac is filled with larger cells, con- taining fat, except in the centre, where the cells have become broken up, leaving a cavity containing the debris of cells and a mass of fatty matter, which constitutes the sebaceous secretion. The orifices of the ducts open most frequently into the hair-follicles, but occasionally upon the general surface. On the nose and face the glands are of large size, distinctly lobulated, and often become much enlarged from the accumulation of pent-up secretion. The largest sebaceous glands are those found in the eyelids—the Meibomian glands. The sudoriferous or sweat glands are the organs by Avhich a large portion of the aqueous and gaseous materials are excreted by the skin. They are found in almost every part of this structure and are situated in small pits in the deep parts of the corium, or, more frequently, in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, surrounded by a quantity of adipose tissue. They are small, lobular, reddish bodies, consisting of a single convoluted tube, from which the afferent duct proceeds upwards through the corium and cuticle, becomes somewhat dilated at its extremity, and opens on the surface of the cuticle by an oblique valve-like aperture. The efferent duct, as it passes through the epidermis, presents a spiral arrangement, being twisted like a corkscrew, in those parts where the epidermis is thick ; where, however, it is thin, the spiral arrangement does not exist. In the superficial layers of the corium, the duct is straight, but in the deeper layers it is convoluted or even twisted. The spiral course of these ducts is especially distinct in the thick cuticle of the palm of the hand and sole of the foot. The size of the glands varies. They are especially large in those regions where the amount of perspiration is great, as in the axillae, where they form a thin, mammillated layer of a reddish colour, which corresponds exactly to the situation of the hair in this region ; they are large also in the groin. Their number varies. They are most numerous on the palm of the hand, presenting, ■ according to Krause, 2,800 orifices on a square inch of the integument, and are rather less numerous on the sole of the foot. In both of these situations the I orifices of the ducts are exceedingly regular, and correspond to the small transverse I grooves which intersect the ridges of the papillae. In other situations they are more ! irregularly scattered, but in nearly equal numbers, over parts including the same • extent of surface. In the neck and back they are least numerous, their number I amounting to 417 on the square inch (Krause). Their total number is estimated ; by the same writer at 2,381,248, and, supposing the aperture of each gland to ! represent a surface of ^ig- of a line in diameter, he calculates that the whole of ; these glands would present an evaporating surface of about eight square inches, j Each gland consists of a single tube intricately convoluted, terminating at one end j by a blind extremity, and opening at the other end upon the surface of the skin. 1 In the larger glands this single duct usually divides and subdivides dichotomously ; the smaller ducts ultimately terminating in short csecal pouches, rarely anasto-64 GENEEAL ANATOMY mosing. The wall of the duct is thick, the width of the canal rarely exceeding one third of its diameter. The tuhe, both in the gland and where it forms the excre- tory duct, consists of two layers—an outer, formed by fine areolar tissue, and an inner layer of epithelium. The external or fibro-cellular coat is thin, continuous with the superficial layer of the corium, and extends only as high as the surface of the true skin. The epithelial lining in the distal part of the coiled tube of the gland proper consists of a single layer of cubical epithelium, supported on a basement membrane^ and beneath it, between the epithelium and the fibro-cellular coat, a layer of plain muscular fibres, arranged longitudinally. In the duct and the proximal part of the coiled tube of the gland proper there are two or more layers of polyhedral cells, lined on their internal surface, i.e. next the lumen of the tube, by a deli- cate membrane or cuticle, and on their outer surface by a limiting membrana propria, but there are no muscular fibres. The epithelium is continuous with the epidermis and with the delicate internal cuticle which is all that is present in the epidermic portion of the tube. When the cuticle is carefully removed from the surface of the cutis, these convoluted tubes of epithelium may be drawn out and form short, thread-like processes on its under surface. The contents of the smaller sweat-glands are quite fluid ; but in the larger glands the contents are semi-fluid and opaque, and contain a number of coloured granules and cells which appear analogous to epithelial cells. SEROUS MEMBRANES The serous membranes form shut sacs and may be regarded as lymph-sacs, from which lymphatic vessels arise by stomata or openings between the epi helial cells (see page 55). The sac consists of one portion which is applied to the walls of the cavity which it lines—the parietal portion; and another reflected over the surface of the organ or organs contained in the cavity—the visceral portion. Sometimes the sac is arranged quite simply, as the tunica vaginalis testis ; at others with numerous involutions or recesses, as the peritoneum, in which, nevertheless, the membrane can always be traced continuously around the whole circumference. The sac is completely closed, so that no communication exists between the serous cavity and the parts in its neighbourhood. An apparent exception exists in the peri-: toneum of the female ; for the Fallopian tube opens freely into the peritoneal cavity in the dead subject, so that a bristle can be passed from the one into the other. But this communication is closed during life, except at the moment of the passage of the ovum out of the ovary into the tube, as is proved by the fact that no inter- change of fluids ever takes place between the two cavities in dropsy of the perito- neum, or in accumulation of fluid in the Fallopian tubes.* The serous membrane is often supported by a firm, fibrous layer, as is the case with the pericardium, and such membranes are sometimes spoken of as ' fibro-serous.' The various serous membranes are the peritoneum, lining tlie cavity of the * The communication between the uterine cavity and the peritoneal sac is not only apparent in the dead subject, but is an anatomical fact, Avhich is established by the con- tinuity of its epithelium with that covering the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and fimbriae.

(From Klein and Noble Smith's ' Atlas of Histology.')65 MUCOUS MEMBRANE abdomen ; the two pleuras and the pericardium, Hning the lungs and heart respec- tively ; and the tunicae vaginales, surrounding each testicle in the scrotum.* Serous membranes are thin, transparent, glistening structures, lined on their inner surface by a single layer of polygonal or pavement endothelial cells, supported on a matrix of fibrous connective tissue, with networks of fine elastic fibres, in which is con- tained numerous capillaries and lymphatics. On the surface of the endothelium between the cells numerous apertures or interruptions are to be seen. Some of these are stomata, surrounded by a ring of cubical epithelium (see fig. 12), and communicate with a lymphatic capillary (see p. 55) ; others (pseudostomata) are mere interruptions in the epithelial layer, and are occupied by processes of the branched connective-tissue corpuscle of the subjacent tissue or by accumulations of the intercellular cement-substance. The secretion of these membranes is, in most cases, only sufticient in quantity to moisten the surface, but not to furnish any appreciable quantity of fluid. When a small quantity can be collected, it appears to resemble in many respects the lymph, and like that fluid coagulates spontaneously ; but when secreted in large quantities, as in dropsy, it is a watery fluid, which gives a precipitate of albumen on boiling. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES Synovial membranes, like serous membranes, are connective-tissue membranes placed between two movable tissues, so as to diminish friction, as between the two articular ends of the bones forming a movable joint; between a tendon and a bone, where the former glides over the latter ; and between the skin and various subcutaneous bony prominences. The synovial membranes are composed essentially of connective tissue, with the cells and fibres of that structure, containing numerous vessels and nerves. It was formerly supposed that these membranes were analogous in structure to the serous membranes, and consisted of a layer of flattened cells on a basement- membrane. No such cells, however, exist, and the only ones found on the surface are irregularly branched connective-tissue corpuscles, similar to those found through- ; out the tissue. Here and there these cells are collected in patches and present the appearance of epithelium, but do not possess the true characters of an endothelial layer. They are surrounded and held together by an albuminous ground-substance. A further description of the synovial membranes will be found in the descriptive anatomy of the joints. MUCOUS MEMBRANE Mucous membranes line all those passages by which the internal parts com- municate with the exterior, and are continuous with the skin at the various orifices jof the surface of the body. They are soft and velvety, and very vascular, and jtheir surface is coated over by their secretion, mticus, which is of a tenacious consistence, and serves to protect them from the foreign substances introduced into the body with which they are brought in contact. They are described as lining the two tracts—the gastro-pulmonary and the genito-urinary; and all, or almost all, mucous membranes may be classed as belonging to and continuous with the one or the other of these tracts. The external surfaces of these membranes are attached to the parts which they tine by means of connective tissue, which is sometimes very abundant, forming a oose and lax bed, so as to allow considerable movement of the opposed surfaces pn each other. It is then termed the suhmucoiis tissue. At other times it is exceedingly scanty, and the membrane is closely connected to the tissue beneath ; * The arachnoid membrane lining the brain and spinal cord was formerly regarded as I serous membrane, but is now no longer classed with them, as it differs from them in structure, and does not form a shut sac as do the other serous membranes. FGENERAL ANATOMY 66 sometimes, for example, to muscle, as in the tongue ; sometimes to cartilage, as in the larynx ; and sometimes to bone, as in the nasal fossae and sinuses of the skull. In structure a mucous membrane is composed of corium and epithelium. The epithelium is of various forms, including the squamous, columnar, and ciliated, and is often arranged in several layers (see fig. ii). This epithelial layer is supported by the corium, which is analogous to the derma of the skin, and con- sists of connective tissue, either simply areolar, or containing a greater or less quantity of lymphoid tissue. This tissue is usually covered on its external surface by a transparent structureless basement-membrane, and internally merges into the submucous areolar tissue. It is only in some situations that the basement-mem- brane can be demonstrated. The corium is an exceedingly vascular membrane, containing a dense network of capillaries, which lie immediately beneath the epithelium, and are derived from small arteries in the submucous tissue. The fibro-vascular layer of the corium contains, besides the areolar tissue and vessels, unstriped muscle-cells, which form in many situations a definite layer, called the mnscularis mucoscz. These are situated in the deepest part of the mem- brane, and are plentifully supphed with nerves. Other nerves pass to the epithelium and terminate between the cells. Lymphatic vessels are found in great abundance, commencing either by csecal extremities or in networks, and communicating with plexuses in the submucous tissue. Embedded in the mucous membrane are found numerous glands, and projecting from it are processes (villi and papillae) analogous to the papillae of the skin. These glands and processes, however, exist only at certain parts, and it will be more convenient to defer their description to the sequel, where the parts are described as they occur. SECRETING GLANDS The secreting glands are organs in which the blood, circulating in capillary vessels, is brought into contact with epithelial cells, whereby certain elements are separated (' secreted') ou*t of the blood. The essential parts therefore of a secreting gland are cells, which have the power of extracting from the blood certain matters, and in some cases convertmg them into new chemical compounds ; and blood-vessels, by which the blood is brought into close relationship Avith these cells. The general arrangement in all secreting structures—that is to say, not only in secreting glands, but also in secreting membranes—is that the cells are arranged on one surface of an extra-vascular basement-membrane, which supports them, and a minute plexus of capillary vessels ramifies on the other surface of the membrane. The cells then extract from the blood certain constituents which pass through the membrane into the cells, where they are prepared and elaborated. The basement- membrane does not, however, always exist, and any free surface would appear to answer the same purpose in some cases. By the various modifications of this secreting surface the different glands are formed. This is generally effected by an involution of the membraiie in different ways, the object being to increase the extent of secreting surface within a given bulk. In the simplest form a single involution takes place, constituting a simple gland ; this may be either in the form of an open tube (fig. 71, a), or the walls of the tube may be dilated so as to form a saccule (fig. 71, b). These are named the simple tubular or saccular glands. Or, instead of a short tube, the involution may be lengthened to a considerable extent, and then coiled up to occupy less space. This constitutes the simple convoluted tubular gland, an example of which may be seen in the sweat-glands of the skin (fig. 71, c). If, instead of a single involution, secondary involutions take place from the primary one, as in fig. 71, D and e, the gland is then termed a compound one. These secondary involutions may assume either a saccular or tubular form, and so constitute the two subdivisions—the compound saccular or racemose gland, and the67 SECRETING GLANDS co7npound tubular. The racemose gland in its simplest form consists of a primary involution which forms a sort of cluct, upon the extremity of which are found a number of secondary involutions, called saccules or alveoli, as in Brunner's glands (fig. 71, d). But, again, in other instances, the duct, instead of being simple, may divide into branches, and these again into other branches, and so on ; each ultimate ramification terminating in a dilated cluster of saccules, and thus we may have the secreting surface almost indefinitely extended, as in the salivary glands (fig. 71, e). In the compound Utbular glands the division of the primary duct takes place in the same way as in the racemose glands, but the branches retain their tubular form, and do not terminate in saccular recesses, but become greatly lengthened out (fig. 71, f). The best examples of this form of gland are to be found in the kidney and testicle. All these varieties of glands are produced by a more or less compli- cated involution of a secreting membrane, and they are all identical in structure ; that is to say, the saccules or tubes, as the case may be, are lined with cells, generally spheroidal or columnar in figure, and on their outer surface is an intimate plexus of capillary vessels. The secretion, whatever it may be, is eliminated by the cells from the blood, and is poured into the saccule or tube, and so finds its way out through the primary involution on to the free surface of the secreting mem- brane. In addition, however, to these glands, which are formed by an involution of the secreting membrane, there are some few others which are formed by a protrusion of the same structure, as in the vascular fringes of synovial membranes. This form of secreting structure is not nearly so frequently met with. F 2OEIQIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BODY THE whole body is developed out of the ovum (fig. 72) when fertilised by the spermatozoa. The ovum is merely a simple nucleated cell, or collection of protoplasm, and the spermatozoa disappear when they have accomplished their mysterious function. All the complicated changes by which the various intricate organs of the whole body are formed from one simple cell may be reduced to two general processes, viz. the segmentation or cleavage of cells, and their differentia- tion. The former process consists in the splitting of the nucleus and its investing cell-wall, whereby the original cell is represented by two. The differentiation of cells is a term used to describe that unknoAvn power or tendency impressed on cells which, to all methods of examination now known, seem absolutely identical, whereby they grow into different forms ; so that (to take the first instance which occurs in the growth of the embryo) the indifferent cells of the vascular area are differen- tiated, some of them into blood-globules, others into the solid tissue which forms the blood-vessels. The extreme complexity of the process of development renders Fig. 73.—Human ovum from a middle-sized follicle. vT Vitelline membrane or zottu pellu- cidn. b.

Germinal vesicle and germinal spot. it at all times difficult to describe it intelligibly, and still more so in a work like this, where adequate space and illustration can hardly be afforded, having respect to the main purpose of the work. I can only hope to render the leading features of the process tolerably plain, and must refer the reader who wishes to follow the various changes more minutely to the special works on the subject, and especially the work of Foster and Balfour. Many of the statements which are accepted in human embryology are made only on the strength of experiments on the lower animals, direct observation on the human subject being impossible. The ovum is a small spheroidal body situated in immature Graafian vesicles near their centre, but in the mature ones in contact with the membrana granulosa,* at that part of the vesicle which projects from the surface of the ovary. The cells of the membrana granulosa are accumulated round the ovum in greater number than at any other part of the vesicle, forming a kind of granular zone, the discus proligems. The human ovum (fig. 73) is extremely minute, measuring from t^o of * See the description of the ovary at a future page.69 FERTILISATION OF OVUM an inch in diameter. It is a cell consisting externally of a transparent envelope, the zoim pellucida or vitelline membrane. Within this, and in close contact with it, is the yolk or vitellus ; embedded in the substance of the yoke is a small vesicular body, the germinal vesicle (vesicle of Purkinje), the nucleus of the cell ; and this contains as its nucleolus a small spot, the macula germinativa, or germinal spot of Wagner. The zona pellucida, or vitelline membrane, is a thick, colourless, transparent membrane, which appears under the microscope as a radially striated membrane, bounded externally and internally by a dark outline. The stria3 are believed to be minute pores, and are regarded as the channels by which nutritive particles are admitted into the interior of the ovum and possibly the way by which the spermatozoa gain access into the interior of the ovum, after the rupture of the Graafian follicle. The presence of these striae has given to the zona pellucida the name of zona radiata, or striated membrane of the ovum. The zona pellucida corresponds to the chorion of the impregnated ovum. The yolk consists of granular protoplasm, i.e. granules or globules of various sizes, embedded in a finely reticulated matrix. The smaller granules resemble pigment; the larger granules, which are in the greatest number at the periphery of the yolk, resemble fat-globules. In the human ovum the number of granules is comparatively small. Before and immediately after fertilisation it shows dis- tinct movements of contraction and expansion. The germinal vesicle consists of a fine, transparent, structureless membrane containing a clear matrix, in which are occasionally found a few granules. It is about -j^-Q of an inch in diameter, and in immature ova lies nearly in the centre of the yolk; but as the ovum becomes developed it approaches the surface, and enlarges much less rapidly than the yolk. The germinal spot occupies that part of the periphery of the germinal vesicle which is nearest to the periphery of the yolk. It is opaque, of a yellow colour, and finely granular in structure, measuring from -^-^-^ to 2-£-oo of inch. The phenomena attending the discharge of the ova from the Graafian vesicles, since they belong as much or more to the ordinary function of the ovary than to the general subject of the growth of the body, are described with the anatomy of the ovaries on a subsequent page. Either before its escape from the Graafian follicle or immediately after, the ovum undergoes a peculiar change, which results in the formation of one or more peculiar bodies, the polar globules of Robin, the origin of which has not hitherto been known; and also with the formation of another body, which appears to take a remarkable part in fecundation, and is named the 'female pronucleus.' The manner in which these bodies are developed from the germinal vesicle is briefly as follows : usually before the rupture of the Graafian follicle, but after the ovum has become mature or ripe, a portion of the germinal vesicle is protruded outside the yoke, but still remains within the vitelline membrane; this forms a small globular mass and constitutes the first polar globule. After a time, generally not till the ovum has entered the tube, a second protrusion of a portion of the germinal vesicle takes place, and forms a second polar globule. We have thus about two-thirds of the germinal vesicle extruded from the yolk and about one-third remaining behind, and at the ejection of each of these bodies a visible shrinking of the yolk takes place. The portion of the germinal vesicle which remains behind recedes from the surface towards the centre of the yolk and assumes a spherical form, and is now termed the ' female pronucleus.' All these changes, it must be understood, occur at each expulsion of an ovum, and are quite independent of fecundation. The first changes in the ovum which take place at the time of conception appear to be as follows : One or more spermatozoa penetrate the ovum, and come into contact with the yolk, and with the portion of the germinal vesicle remaining in the yolk. It seems as if this normally occurs in the Fallopian tube,* but it is * Many physiologists, as Bischoff and Dr. M. Barry, taught that the ovum is fecund- ated in the ovary, but the reasoning of Dr. Allen Thomson appears very cogent in provingGENEEAL ANATOMY 70 possible that it sometimes occurs before the ovum has entered the tube, or after it has passed through the tube and reached the cavity of the uterus ; abnormally it may even take place in the peritoneal cavity. One spermatozoon, more advanced than the rest, becomes buried in the yolk, the tail disappears, and the head, a sort of nuclear body, constitutes the ' male pronucleus.' This gradually approaches the female' pronucleus, which by this time is situated in the centre of the yolk. As soon as they come into contact they fuse into one, and thus fecundation is effected (fig. 74). It is believed by some physiologists that one spermatozoon is sufficient for fecundation ; but in all probability several spermatozoa, as a rule, penetrate the yolk and undergo the same process of conversion into male pronuclei, reach the female pronucleus, and fuse with it.* The first result of the fertilisation of the ovum is a cleavage or multiplication of the yolk, which is first cleft into two masses, the germinal vesicle having pre- viously split up into two nuclei; so that it now consists of two separate masses of protoplasm, each containing a nucleus, situated within the original vitelline membrane which takes no part in this process of division. Then, each of these two daughter elements divides in like manner, and thus four nucleated elements Fig. 74.—Fertilisation of the ovum of an echinoderm. a. Spermatozoon, m. pr. Male pronucleus, f.pr.

(Prom Quain's ' Anatomy,' Seleuka.) are formed, and so on, until at length a mulberry-like agglomeration of nucleated masses of protoplasm results (fig. 75). These masses are sometimes termed vitelline spheres. The manner in which segmentation occurs is somewhat peculiar. The two spheres resulting from the first cleavage are of unequal size. One, which for the sake of distinction we will call the u]jper or epiblastic cell, is larger than the other, the loioer or hypoblastic cell. And after they have divided three or four times, the rate of cleavage in the spheres derived from the upper or epiblastic segment becomes more rapid than in those derived from the lower or hypo- blastic segment. In addition to this, the spheres derived from the upper segment have a tendency to spread over and enclose those from the lower segment; so that by about the ninth or tenth division there is an external layer of spheres derived from the primary upper or epiblastic segment surrounding and almost enclosing a mass of spheres, which in consequence of their diminished rate of cleavage are fewer in number and larger in size, derived from the primary lower or hypoblastic segment (fig. 76, a). Fluid collects between the two sets of spheres, that the usual spot at which the spermatozoa meet the ovum is in the tube, down which it slowly travels to the uterus, in its course becoming surrounded by an albuminous envelope derived from the walls of the tube. j * If the student refers to the development of the generative organs, he will find that j the ovum of the female and the spermatozoon of the male are derived from fundamentally the same structures, and therefore their fusion is the union of two elements of very similar morphological value.SEGMENTATION OF OVUM 71 except at one part, where they remain in contact, and the ovum is converted into a sac, formed by a layer of spheres derived from the upper primary segment and containing at one part another mass of spheres derived from the lower primary seg- ment (fig. 76, b). The inner cells are rather more granular than the outer, beneath Fig. 75.—First stages of segmentation of a mammalian ovum : semi-diagrammatic. (From a drawing by Allen Thomson.) a h ^ z.p.

The ultimate destination of the outermost complete layer of spheres is, at present, doubtful. By some they are believed to be transitory and to gradually Fig. 76.—Ovum of the rabbit at the end of the process of segmentation. ep. Epiblast. hy. Primitive hypoblast, hp.

(From Balfour, after Ed. van Beueden.) disappear in the course of the formation of the various layers of the blastodermic membrane; by others it is thought that they form the outer layer (epiblast) of this membrane. Adopting the latter and more general view, the ovum would consist of a cavity surrounded by (i) a layer of cells completely lining the interior of the vitelline membrane, and (2) by a second layer internal to these and partially72 GENERAL ANATOMY Fig. 77.—Ovum with the germhial area, seen in profile to show the division of the blastodermic mem- brane. lining the interior of the outer layer, both sets of cells derived from the segmen- tation of the yolk. The double layer of cells is called the ' blastodermic membrane,' the outer layer being termed the ' epiblast,' and the inner the ' hypoblast.' At first the area of the blastodermic membrane, which consists of both the inner and outer layers of cells, is a small disc, in which the first traces of the embryo are seen ; hence it is called the germinal disc or area germinativa (fig. 77). The first trace of the embryo appears as a faint streak at the posterior end of the area germinativa, called the primitive traoe. After the formation of the primitive trace, but previous to the appearance of the next parts of the embryo, presently to be described, viz. the laminae dorsales and the notochord, the blastodermic membrane consists of only two layers, the ejjiblast and liypohlast, but after the formation of these structures a third layer makes its appearance. This is the mesohlast, and is situated between the other two (fig. 78). As to the precise origin of this third layer considerable difference of opinion exists. According to some embryologists it is formed entirely by proliferation of cells belong- ing to the epiblastic layer ; according to others it is formed by a splitting of the hypoblast, or, at all events, a differentiation of it into a central layer of mesoblastic cells and a lower layer of hypoblastic cells. Or, what seems most probable, it is derived mainly from the epiblast, the hypoblast taking a smaller and more subordinate share in its forma- tion.

The external, which used to be called the serous layer, but is now more commonly termed the epiblast, or ectoderm; the internal, the mucous layer, the hypoblast, or entoderm; and the middle, which is now usually called the mesoblast, or mesoderm, but which was formerly named the ' vascular layer.' The epiblast is mainly concerned in the formation of the external cuticle and the whole of the nervous system. It consists of cells of an epithelial character; that is to say, cells of an irregular columnar shape, forming, for the most part, a single stratum, but becoming more numerous and flattened at the germinal disc. The epidermis of the body and all the involutions of the epidermis in the ducts of superficial glands, as the mamniffi, as well as the brain, the spinal cord, the nerves, and the portions of the nose, eye, and ear, which are directly formed from the brain, are developed from it. The external layer of the amnion is also formed from the epiblast, and probably also a portion of the chorion.73 BLASTODERM A. Portion of the ovum with the zona peUucida and the germinal area.

The hypoblast forms also the deeper layer of the umbilical vesicle and allantois. Its cells are epithelial and are at first flattened, but subsequently become columnar and larger than those of the epiblast. All the rest of the embryo is formed from the mesoblast, viz. all the vascular and locomotive system, the cutis, all the connective tissues, and the genito-urinary organs, with the exception of the epithelium of the bladder and urethra, which is developed from the hypoblast. The vascular system of the foetus extends to the yolk and the maternal parts along the umbilical vesicle and allantois, so that the greater part of these bodies and the outer layer of the amnion are also formed out of the mesoblast. The foetal portion of the placenta, being essentially a vascular structure, is also developed from the mesoblast. Its cells are irregular and branched and surrounded by a considerable amount of intercellular fluid. It may therefore be regarded as resembling more closely embryonic connective tissue. First rudiments of the embryo (figs. 79 and 80).—The primitive trace alluded to above as appearing in the area germinativa, is a very transitory structure, which marks the direction of the embryonic axis, and is gradually lost in consequence of its place becoming occupied by the rudimentary spinal column. The first real approach towards a definite form in the embryo is made (i) by the development of the rudimentary spinal column; (2) by the cleavage of the middle layer of the blastodermic membrane from which a part of that column is derived ; and (3) by the incurvation of the column at its cephalic end to form the brain and brain-case. First, a folding up of the cells of the epiblast or outer layer takes place. This commences in the anterior part of the area germinativa and extends in the same direction as the primitive trace, gradually occupying its position until this latter is lost at the caudal extremity of the embryo (fig. 81). This folding up of the epiblast gives rise to a longitudinal groove down its centre, in consequence of the manner in which the cells of the epiblast are heaped up into two longitudinal ridges, with a furrow between them, so that the sides and base of the groove are formed of epiblastic cells (fig. 82, a). The mesoblast, lying between the epiblast and hypoblast, fills up the space thus caused between these two layers, so that the sides of the groove are occupied by a longitudinal thickening of mesoblast; the two masses being separated at the bottom of the groove by the junction of the epiblast and hypoblast at the situation of the primitive trace. The groove becomes deeper and deeper in consequence of the further growing up of the cells to form the ridge on either side. In this way the ridges eventually become two plates, the lamince dorsales or medullary plates, which finally coalesce and thus form a closed tube, the neural canal, lined by epiblast and having a covering of the same mem- brane (fig. 82). These membranes are at first in contact with one another, but eventually become separated, mesoblastic structures growing up between them and the line of coalescence becomes obliterated. The coalescence first takes place in the middle of the embryo, then towards the cephalic end, and lastly at the caudal extremity. The lining of this tube is developed into the nervous centres, the covering into the epidermis of the back and head. The cephalic extremity of the neural canal is soon seen to be more dilated than the rest, and to present constrictions dividing it imperfectly into three chambers : the brain is developed from this dilated portion ; the spinal cord takes its origin from the remainder of the tube. Below the neural canal, the hypoblast and epiblast are in contact, separating the two longitudinal thickenings of mesoblast on either side of the canal. Here a thickening of the hypoblast, commencing from the anterior end of the primitive trace, takes place and gradually separates itself off from the hypo- blast, lying between this membrane and the epiblast, at the bottom of the neural76 GENEKAL ANATOMY canal. This is known as the notocliord or chorda dorsalis. This, when fully developed, forms a continuous rod-shaped body lying below the primitive groove and composed of clear epithelium-like cells. It is essentially an embryonic structure, though traces of it remain in the centre of the intervertebral discs throughout hfe. The collection of mesoblastic cells, which forms a thick longitudinal column on either side of the neural canal, becomes separated from the rest of the mesoblastic layer. It undergoes a series of transverse segmentations and becomes converted into a row of well-defined, dark, square segments or masses, separated by clear, transverse intervals, called the protovertchrcB or mesoblastic somites. They first make their appearance in the region which afterwards becomes the neck, then further forwards towards the head, and afterwards extend along the body.

On either side of the protovertebrse the mesoblast sphts into two layers, the upper, or that covered by epiblast, is called somatopleure, and the lower, lined by hypoblast, the splanclinopleure (fig. 82, b, 5-5'). From the former the skeleton muscles and true skin of the external parts of the body are derived, from the latter the muscular and other mesoblastic portions of the viscera. 1 The space between them is the common pleuro-peritoneal cavity. Whilst the parietes of the body are still unclosed, this common pleuro-peritoneal cavity is continuous with the space between the amnion and chorion, as seen in fig. 79, F. The embryo, which at first seems to be a mere streak, extends longitudi- nally and laterally. As it grows forward the cephalic end becomes remarkably77 DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMBRYO curved on itself (cephalic flexure), and a smaller but distinct flexure takes place at its hinder end (caudal flexure). At the same time the sides of the embryo grow and curve towards each other ; so that the embryo is aptly compared to a canoe turned over (fig. 83). In consequence of this incurving of the embryo, both in an antero- posterior and a lateral di- Fig. S3.—Diagrammatic section through the ovum of a mammal in the long axis of the embrvo.

The smaller globe is formed by the part of the blastodermic membrane (area germina- tiva) which has already undergone certain changes in the formation of the embryo, and constitutes the part which has been com- pared to a canoe. The larger globe is called the yolk-sac or itmhilical ve- sicle, and is formed by the rest of the blastodermic membrane, i.e. that part which is not concerned in the formation of the area germinativa. The two freely communicate through the constriction which is the site of the future umbihcus, and through this constriction the internal layer of the blastodermic membrane (the hj'poblast) and the innermost of the two layers into which, as has been already stated, the mesoblast divides, viz. the splanchnopleure, pass out; the incurving having only involved the somato-pleural layer of the meso- blast and the epiblast (fi*g. 84). The umbiKcal vesicle is, therefore, at first a mere part of the general cavity of the yolk, partly enclosed by the embryo ; but as the latter grows round on all sides towards the umbiUcal aperture, the yolk becomes dis- tinguished into two portions. One lies inside the embryo and eventually forms a part of the intestinal cavity (out of which also, as will hereafter be seen, the bladder is developed). The other lies external to the embryo and remains therefore for a time a part of what is, in a more restricted sense, the ovum. The two parts are almost separated from each other by the meeting of the abdominal walls of the embryo at the umbilicus, through which they still communicate by a passage, the omijhalo-mesenteric duct, the destination of which will be pointed out presently. The extra-embryonic portion is of small importance and very temporary duration in the human subject. It is for the purpose of supplying nutrition to the embryo during the very earliest period, before it can obtain it from the uterine sinuses of the mother. In the oviparous animals, however, where no supply of nutrition can be obtained from the mother, since the egg is entirely separated from her, the yolk- sac is large and of great importance, as it supplies nutrition to the chick during the whole of foetation. Vessels developed in the middle blastodermic layer soon cover the umbilical vesicle, forming the vascular area, the chief vessels of which are the ovipJialo-mesenteric, two in number (fig. 85). The vessels of this area appear to absorb the fluid of the umbihcal vesicle, which as the fluid is absorbed dries up and has no further function. The activity of the umbilical vesicle ceases aboutGENERAL ANATOMY 78 Fig. 84.—Diagrammatic section of embryo, showing the formation of the miibihcal vesicle.

In fact the umbihcal vesicle provides for the nutrition of the foetus from the ovum itself, while the allantois is the channel whereby it is nourished from the uterine tissues. The umbilical vesicle, containing fluid, remains visible, however, up to the fourth or fifth month, with its pedicle and the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. The latter vessels become atrophied as the functional activity of the body with which they are connected ceases. So far we have traced—(i) the segmentation or cleavage of the yolk into a number of nucleated cells—' vitelline spheres.' (2) The accumulation of fluid within the ovum, and the arrangement of the vitelline spheres around the fluid on the internal surface of the vitelline membrane, forming a second membrane, the * blastodermic membrane.' (3) The separation of the blastodermic membrane into three layers, named, from within outwards, the ' hypoblast,' the ' mesoblast,' and the ' epiblast.' (4) The formation of an elongated, oval-shaped disc, called the * area germinativa.' (5) The appearance in the centre of the area germinativa of a delicate line or furrow, running longitudinally, and called the 'primitive trace.' (6) The formation of a distinct groove in the situation of this primitive trace, catsed by the growing-up of the cells on either side of it, so as to form two longitu- dinal ridges, called the ' laminae dorsales.' (7) The increase and incurvation of these laminas dorsales, until they meet behind, enclosing a canal, lined by epiblast. The canal is the neural canal, and from the epiblast which lines it the nervous centres are developed. (8) The formation, in the hypoblast immediately under this canal, of a continuous rod-shaped body, the ' chorda dorsalis,' or ' notochord.' (9) The formation from the mesoblast, on either side of the notochord, of a longitudinal column, divided into a number of square segments, the ' protovertebra.' (10) The splitting of the mesoblast, external to the protovertebrs, into two layers—the outer, called the ' somatopleure,' lined externally by the epiblast; the inner, called the * splanchnopleure,' lined internally by the hypoblast, a space being left between the two, which forms the ' pleuro-peritoneal cavity.' (11) The curving of the embryo on itself, both longitudinally and laterally, so as to be comparable to a canoe ; the walls being formed of all three layers of the blastodermic membrane and the well of the canoe—that is, the body-cavity of the embryo, opening into the cavity of the yolk-sac. (12) A portion of the yolk-sac lying in the body- cavity of the embryo, and a portion outside it; the two communicating by a duct, the ' omphalo-mesenteric ' duct. The portion of the yolk-sac external to the body- cavity is termed the umbilical vesicle, and provides nutrition to the embryo until such time as the allantois is formed; vessels, developed from the middle blastodermic layer, ramifying over it, and gradually absorbing its contents.* The next step towards a clear understanding of the development of the embryo is to have a proper conception of the manner in which the membranes enveloping the foetus are formed. The membranes investing the foetus are the amnion, the chorion, and the decidua. The two former are developed from foetal structures, and are proper to the foetus ; the latter is formed in the uterus, and is derived from the maternal structures. The Amnion.—The amnion is the membrane which immediately surrounds the embryo. It is of small size at first, but increases considerably towards the middle of pregnancy, as the foetus acquires the power of independent movement. It exists only in reptiles, birds, and mammals, which are hence called ' Amniota,' but is absent in amphibia and fishes. It is formed thus. At or near the extremities of the incurved foetus—that is to say, at the point of constriction of the blastodermic membrane, where the portion which has undergone changes to form the body of the embryo joins the part devoted to the formation of the umbilical vesicle—an inflection of the epiblast and outer layer of the mesoblast, which have become * According to Professor John A. Eyder, it is ' very doubtful if any considerable amount of nutriment is supplied to the embryo from the yolk-sac at any time.'8o GENERAL ANATOMY separated from the inner layer of the mesoblast and hypoblast by the formation of the plem'o-peritoneal cavity, takes place (fig. 79, d 7). These inflections or back- ward folds commence first at the cephalic extremity, and subsequently at the caudal end and sides, and deepen more and more, in consequence of the sinking of the embryo into the blastodermic vesicle, until, gradually approaching, they meet one another (fig. 79, e 7). After they come in contact they fuse together, and the septum between them disappears; so that the inner layer of the cephalic fold becomes Fig. 86.—Diagram of a transverse section of a mammalian embryo, showing the mode of formation of the amnion. The amniotic folds have nearly united in the middle line. (From Quain's ' Anatomy,' vol. i. pt. i. 1890.) Epiblast, blue ; mesoblast, red ; hypoblast and iiotochord, black. continuous with the inner layer of the caudal fold, and the outer with the outer (fig. 79, F 7'). ■ Thus we have two membranes, one formed by the inner layer of the fold—the true amnion—which encloses a space over the back of the embryo—the amniotic cavity (fig. 79, f and g, a)—containing a clear fluid, the liquor amnii* The other, the outer layer of the fold—the false amnion—lines the internal surface of the origmal vitelline membrane. Between the two is an interval, which of course communicates with the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. This it continues to do until the body-walls of the embryo have grown up and coalesced at the umbilicus. Then the amniotic fold is carried downwards, and encloses the umbilical cord, by which the foetus is attached to the placenta. The true amnion—or, as it is usually called, the amnion—is formed of two layers, derived respectively from the epiblast and from the parietal layer of the mesoblast. The one from the epiblast consists of nucleated cells ; the other, from the mesoblast, has a fibrous and, according to some embryologists, a muscular structure ; at all events, it possesses the power of rhythmic contraction during life. In some animals this layer is vascular. The amnion is at first in close contact with the surface of the body of the embryo, but about the fourth or fifth week fluid begins to accumulate, and thus separates the two. The quantity steadily increases up to about the sixth month of pregnancy, after which it diminishes somewhat. The use of the liquor amnii is believed to be chiefly to allow of the movements of the foetus in the later stages of * The student should be careful not to confound this cavity witii that formed between the true and false amnion, which communicates with the pleuro-peritoneal cavity of the embryo. This latter space ought with more propriety to be called the ' amniotic cavity,' since it is contained between the laj-ers of the amnion; whereas the so-called amniotic cavity is not really between the layers of the amnion at all, but between the inner layer of the amnion and the body of the embryo.8i THE CHOKION pregnancy, though it no doubt serves other purposes also. It contams about one per cent, of sohd matter, chiefly albumen, with traces of urea, the latter probably derived from the urinary secretion of the foetus. The Chorion.—The chorion is rather a complex membrane made up essentially of two parts :—first, of the membranes of the ovum external to the pleuro- peritoneal cavity—that is to say, of the vitelline membrane and false amnion ; and, secondly, of a diverticulum of those layers of the original blastodermic membrane which are internal to the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. This diverticulum is called the alla7itois. 1. The portion of the chorion lohich is formed from the membranes of the ovum external to the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. We have seen that in the formation of the amnion we had two layers formed out of a reduplication of the epiblast and outer layer of the mesoblast : one—the ti'-ue amnion—which surrounds the embryo and encloses a cavity between it and the embryo—the amniotic cavity; and secondly, the false amnion, which lies in apposition with the internal surface of the vitelline membrane, and is continuous at its periphery with that part of the original epiblast and somatopleural layer of the mesoblast which did not enter into the formation of the area germinativa; and that between these two layers there is a space (which must not be confounded with the amniotic cavity) which com- municates with the pleuro-peritoneal space, and, according to Dalton, contains a semi-fluid, gelatinous material. The external part of the chorion is formed out of the vitelline membrane with the false amnion and its peripheral continuation with the external layers of the blastoderm ; but the exact share which the three layers take in its formation is at present uncertain. By some embryologists it is believed that the vitelline membrane during the rapid growth of the ovum becomes attenu- _ ated, and finally lost; by others it is thought that it combines with the other layers to form the chorion. But, whichever is true, at a very early period of gestation cellular processes or fringes grow outwards from the external surface of the vitelline membrane, or, if this has disappeared, from the outer layer of the blastoderm, which has been likened by Dalton to tufts of seaweed. They are at first destitute of vessels, and are of simple cellular structure. These fringes, or villi, as they subsequently become, cover at first the whole surface of the chorion ; but as devel- opment progresses and the placenta, by which the extent of the attachment of the ovum to the uterine walls is to be limited, is about to be formed, the villi are not furthet developed over the rest of the chorion, but are confined to that part only which is to form the foetal portion of the placenta. They may, however, be recog- nised all over the chorion, as abortive processes, during the whole of foetal gestation. 2. The Allantois.—This structure is derived from the layers of the blastodermic membrane which are internal to the pleuro-peritoneal space, being formed by the projection of a hollow bud of that part of the hypoblast and splanchnopleure which is contained in the body-cavity of the embryo, and which, as we have before stated, is intended for the formation of the intestinal canal (fig. 83, u). It extends into and through the pleuro-peritoneal space, into the cavity between the true and false amnion, until it meets the latter, over the internal surface of which it spreads. In this diverticulum two arteries and two veins, the allantoic vessels, are developed. The arteries are in the first instance branches of the two primary divisions of the abdominal aorta, but subsequently, when the two aortas coalesce, they become branches of the hypogastric arteries. The veins join the veins of the yolk-sac, and form the umbilical veins. When the allantois meets the chorion, branches from these allantoic vessels permeate the cellular tufts or fringes which have been described as growing from the outer surface of the false amnion and convert them into villi, and these eventually form the foetal portion of the placenta* (fig. 85, c). The allantois is the chief agent of the early circulation, for it is the duct or tract along which the vessels extend which convey the blood of the embryo to the foetal * In some animals, some of the vessels of the villi of the chorion are derived from the yolk-sac, that is from the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. G82 GENERAL ANATOMY chorion, where it is exposed to the influence of the maternal blood circulating in the decidua or uterine portion of the placenta, from which it imbibes the materials of nutrition, and to which it gives up effete materials, the removal of which is necessary for its purification. In Fig. 87.—Sectional i^lan of the gravid uterus in the third and fourth month. (From AYagner.) some animals the allantois is a hollow projection and is usually styled the allantoic vesicle; but in most mammals, and especially in man, the external or mesoblastic element undergoes great develop- ment, while the internal or hypo- blastic element undergoes little increase beyond the body of the embryo, so that it is very doubtful whether any cavity exists in the allantois beyond the limits of the umbilicus, or whether it does not rather consist of a solid mass of material derived from the meso- blastic tissue.* A portion of the allantoic vesicle within the body- cavity is eventually destined to form the bladder, while the re- mainder forms an impervious cord, the urachus, stretching from the summit of the bladder to the um- bilicus. The part external to the foetus forms the umbilical cord, by which the foetus is connected with the villi of the chorion, and which eventually form the foetal portion of the placenta. The Decidua.—The growth of the chorion and placenta can only be understood by tracing the'form- ation of the decidua. The decidua (figs. 80 g, 87) is formed from the mucous membrane of the uterus. Even before the ar- rival of the fecundated ovum in the uterus, the mucous membrane of the latter is vascular and tumid, and when the ovum has reached the uterus it becomes embedded in the folds of the mucous membrane, which grow up around it and finally completely encircle it, so as to cover it in entirely and exclude it from the uterine cavity. Thus two portions of the uterine mucous membrane (decidua) are formed, viz. that which coats the muscular wall of the uterus, decidua vera, and that Avhich is in contact with the ovum, decidua reflcxa. The decidua vera at the OS internum and at the openings of the Fallopian tubes is continuous with the lining membrane of these canals, the thickening of the original mucous membrane of the uterus which converts it into decidua abruptly ceasing at these points. The neck of the uterus after conception is closed by a plug of mucus. The decidua vera «. Plug of ulucus in the neck of the uterus, b. Fallopian tube. c. The deciilua vera. c'-.

Decidua serotina, or placental decidua. * Indeed, it would appear, from the researches of His, that in the human embryo not only is the allantois formed unusually early, as is admitted by all, but in an altogether exceptional manner, not consisting of an outgrowth from the portion of the splanchno- pleure engaged in the formation of the alimentary canal, but being present from the very earliest period as a stalk connecting the posterior extremity of the embryo with the chorion.83 THE PLACENTA is perforated by the openings formed by the enlarged uterine glands, which become much hypertrophied and developed into tortuous tubes. It contains at a later period numerous arteries and venous channels, continuous with the uterine sinuses, and it is from it that the uterine part of the placenta is developed. The portion of the decidua vera which takes part in the formation of the placenta is called the decidiia scrotina (fig. 87,/). The decidua reflexa is shaggy on its outer aspect, but smooth within. The vessels, which it contains at first, disappear after about the third month. About the fifth or sixth month the space between the two layers of the decidua disap- pears, and towards the end of pregnancy the decidua reflexa is transformed into a thin yellowish membrane, which constitutes the external envelope of the ovum. Much additional interest has been given to the physiology of the decidua by the fact, which seems to be now established by the researches of Dr. John Williams, that every discharge of an ovum, whether impregnated or not, is, as a rule, accompanied by the formation of a decidua, and that the essence of menstruation consists in the separation of a decidual layer of the mucous membrane from the uterus ; while in the case of pregnancy there is no exfoliation of the membrane, but, on the contrary, it undergoes further development in the manner described above. The Placenta is the organ by which the connection between the foetus and mother is maintained. It therefore subserves the purposes both of circulation and respiration. It is formed of two parts, as already shown—viz. the maternal portion, which is developed out of the decidua vera (serotina), and the foetal portion formed out of the villi of the chorion. Its shape in the human subject is that of a disc, one side of which adheres to the uterine wall, while the other is covered by the amnion. The villi of the chorion gradually enlarge, forming large projections—'cotyledons'—which each contain the ramifications of vessels com- municating with the umbilical (allantoic) arteries and veins of the foetus. These vascular tufts are covered with epithelium, and project into corresponding depres- sions in the mucous membrane (decidua vera) of the uterine wall. The maternal portion of the placenta consists of a large number of sinuses formed by an enlargement of the vessels of the uterine wall. These bring the uterine blood into close proximity with the villi of the foetal placenta, which dip into the sinuses. The interchange of fluids necessary for the growth of the foetus and for the depura- tion of the blood takes place through the walls of the villi, but there is no direct continuity between the maternal and foetal vessels. The foetal vessels form tufts of capillaries, the blood from which is returned by small veins, which end in tributaries of the umbilical vein. The maternal arteries open into spaces some- what after the manner of the arteries of the erectile tissues. These spaces communicate with a plexus of veins which anastomose freely with one another and give rise, at the edge of the placenta, to a venous channel which runs around its whole circumference—the placental sinus. The umbilical cord appears about the end of the fifth week after conception. It consists of the coils of two arteries {umbilical, originally allantoic) and a single vein, united together by a gelatinous tissue {jelly of Wharton). There are origi- nally two umbilical veins, but one of these vessels becomes obliterated, as do also the two omphalo-mesenteric arteries and veins and the duct of the umbilical vesicle, all of which are originally contained in the rudimentary cord. The per- manent structures of the cord are, therefore, furnished by the allantois. In this manner the human embryo eventually becomes surrounded by three membranes : (i) the amnion^ derived from the outer layer of the mesoblast and the epiblast; (2) the chorion, formed most probably by three layers—the allantois (which is derived from the inner layer of the mesoblast and hypoblast), the false amnion, and perhaps the vitelline membrane ; and (3) the decidua, derived from the mucous membrane of the uterus. Development of the Embryo proper.—The further development of the embryo will, perhaps, be better understood if we follow as briefly as possible the principal facts relating to the chief parts of which the body consists—viz. the spine, theGENERAL ANATOMY 84 cranium, the pharyngeal cavity, mouth, &c., the nervous centres, the organs of the senses, the circulatory system, the alimentary canal and its appendages, the organs of respiration, and the genito-urinary organs.* The reader is also referred to the chronological table of the development of the foetus at the end of this section. Development of the Spine.—We have already traced the first steps in the formation of the spine.—(i) The looping up of two longitudinal folds from the cells of the epiblast on either side of the primitive streak, so as to form a groove, and the gradual growing together of these ridges (lammcs dorsales) so as to convert the groove into a canal, which is lined by epiblast, and out of which the spinal cord is developed. (2) The formation in front of this groove of a continuous cellular cord, enclosed in a structureless sheath, the notochord or chorda dorsalis (fig. 88).

The notochord extends from the cephalic to the caudal extremity of the embryo, and lies in the place which is afterwards occupied by the bodies of the vertebr£e. (3) On either side of the neural canal, a portion of the mesoblastic layer is divided longitudinally from the rest of the mesoblast, so as to form a thick column, which extends from the cephaHc to the caudal extremity of the embryo on either side of the spinal canal and notochord (fig. 82, a 7) ; this is the 2^1'otovertebral column. From the greater part of it is derived the vertebral column, a small portion at the upper and outer part being differentiated from it and eventually forming the muscles The scope of this work only permits the briefest possible reference to these subjects. Those who wish to study the subject of embryology in more detail are referred to Kolliker's EntwicTfelungsgeschicJite; to vol. i. pt. i, of the tenth edition of Quain's Anatomy ; or to the works of Professor Dalton and of Foster and Balfour.DEVELOPMENT OF CRANIUM 85 of the back. (4) This column undergoes a process of transverse segmentation and becomes converted into a number of quadrilateral blocks, the protovertebral somites (fig. 89). The process of segmentation commences in the cervical region and proceeds successively through the other regions of the spine until a number of segments are formed, which correspond very closely to the number of the permanent vertebrae. (5) These protovertebral somites extend laterally ; they grow forwards and inwards until they meet in front of the notochord in the middle line, which they thus enclose ; and backwards and inwards, around the spinal canal, which they also enclose. The notochord and the spinal canal are thus surrounded by a cellular mass derived from the mesoblastic layer, which constitutes the membranous matrix of the vertebrae. This structure is covered on its internal surface by hypoblast, and on its outer by epiblast, and presents the transverse segmentation already described (page 76). (6) The next step is the conversion of this primitive membranous matrix into cartilage. This takes place probably about the fourth or fifth week in the human embryo (Kolliker). The part of the protovertebral somites which has extended backwards to enclose the spinal foramen, and which eventually forms the arches of the vertebrae, simply undergoes a process of chondrification, so that the permanent arches correspond to the primary segment of the protovertebral somites, spaces being left between them for the spinal nerves and ganglia to grow out from the spinal cord. But a somewhat more complex change goes on in the portion of the protovertebral somites which encloses the notochord and which is destined to form the bodies of the vertebrae. Here each one of the protovertebral segments undergoes a second transverse division through its centre, and in the interval which is left between these secondary segmentations the fibrous structure of the intervertebral discs is formed. The half-segment of the original proto- vertebral somites on either side of this secondary segmentation joins with the segment above and below, and undergoes chondrification, and thus forms the basis of the body of a future vertebra. Each cartilaginous body of a vertebra is formed therefore out of half an original protovertebral plate joined to the half of another plate above or below it, as the case may be. (7) The notochord contained in the centre of this chondrifying mass does not continue to grow, but becomes in the human subject relatively smaller, so as, at last, to form a mere slender thread, except opposite the secondary segmentations ; that is to say, corresponding to the intervals between the bodies of the permanent vertebrae. Here it presents thick- enings, and forms an irregular network, the remains of which are to be found at all periods of life in the central pulp of the intervertebral discs. Development of the Ribs and Sternum.—The ribs are formed by extensions of the blastema of the vertebrae in the mesoblastic layer of the blastodermic membrane. These speedily undergo chondrification, and appear as cartilaginous bars, and become separated from the vertebrse at their posterior extremities. At their anterior ends the costal bars, which are to form the nine upper ribs, turn upwards and fuse together so as to form a cartilaginous strip bounding a central median fissure. The strips on either side then join in the middle line from before backwards, and so give rise to a longitudinal piece of cartilage, which represents the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum. In the process of development the sternal attach- ment of the eighth rib disappears, while that of the ninth subdivides, one portion remaining attached to the inferior extremity of the cartilaginous sternum and becoming developed into the ensiform cartilage, the other portion receding from the sternum and becoming attached to the rib above. The further development of the vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, and the ossi- fication of their cartilaginous structure, are described in the body of the work. Development of the Cranium in general and the Face.—We have seen that the first trace of the embryo consists in the formation of a longitudinal fold of the epiblast on either side of a median groove, and that these folds or ridges grow back- wards and meet in the median line, thus forming a canal. This canal, at the cephalic extremity of the embryo, is dilated and forms a bulbous enlargement. The bulbous enlargement soon expands into three vesicular dilatations, which are known as theGENEEAL ANATOMY 86 Fig. 90.—Longitudinal section of the head of an embryo four weeks old, seen from the mside. .

The audi- tory vesicle. thxQQ primary ccrehrcd vesicles, imm which all the different parts of the encephalon are presently to be developed. The most anterior of the three forms the optic thalamus, whilst a hollow projection from it forms the corpus striatum and the cerebral hemispheres ; the middle one forms the tubercula quadrigemina ; the posterior the medulla oblongata. The primary cerebral vesicles are at this time, of course, hollow^, and their cavities freely com- municate with each other at the points of con- striction. As the embryo grows, the cerebral vesicles become twice bent forward on their own axis (figs. 90, 91, A and b). The upper or posterior curvature is called the cerebral; the lower or anterior, the frontal protuberance. Thus, w^e have a triple cavity (see fig. 91, a, where the three cavities are marked c, mc, and mo), lined by epiblast and covered by the same structure. Between these two layers of epiblast, a layer of mesoblast, derived from the protovertebral plates of the trunk, is prolonged and spreads over the w^hole surface of the cerebral vesicles. From these structures the cranium and its contents are developed. The external layer of the epiblast forms the super- ficial epithelium of the scalp. The mesoblastic layer forms the true skin, the blood-vessels, muscles, connective tissue, bones of the skull and membranes of the brain. The layer of epiblast Hning the cavity forms the nervous substance of the encephalon, while the cavity itself constitutes the ventricles. The upper end of the notochord terminates at its cephalic end in a pointed extremity which extends as far forwards as the situation of the body of the future sphenoid bone, and is there embedded in a mass of tissue, the ' investing mass of Eathke.' This mass, derived from mesoblastic tissue, becomes cartilaginous, and from it is developed the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid bones; and by lateral expansions from it the occipitals, the greater wings of the sphenoid, and the periotic mass of cartilage surrounding the primary auditory vesicles. From the front of the investing mass of Eathke, which corresponds in position to the future dorsum sellag, two lateral bars are directed forwards enclosing a space, which forms the pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary body is eventually developed. These bars are named the trabeculce cranii, and extend as far forwards as the anterior extremity of the head, where they coalesce wdth each other. From them the pre-sphenoid and lateral masses of the ethmoid are developed; and from their coalescence a process is prolonged downw^ards to form a portion of the framework of the face hereafter to be described. From the pre-sphenoids, which are developed from these trabeculse, a lateral expansion takes place, wiiich forms the orbito- sphenoid or lesser wings of the sphenoid, enclosing the optic foramen. The portions of the base of the skull above enumerated are formed from cartilage ; the remaining parts, comprising the vault of the skull, are of membranous formation. The head at first consists simply of a cranial cavity, the face being subsequently developed in the manner now to be described by a series of arches with clefts between them (fig. 92). It is usual in our text-books to describe the arches as a series of proce sses which jut out and grow^ downwards, inclining tow^ards each other until they meet in the middle line and thus form a series of inverted arches; whilst the clefts are the spaces left between each pair of processes. This, however, is scarcely the true description, and leads rather to the false impression that the arches are formed by processes budding out from the embryo, much in the same way as the extremities do, and that they are free on every side. What would appear rather to be the case is that the clefts are first formed, and that the arches consist of a thickening of the tissue on either side of the cleft. The arches thus formedDEVELOPMENT OF FACE 87 Fig. 91.—Vertical section of the head in early embryos of the rabbit. Magnified. (From Mihalkovics.) may he divided into two sets, according as they are placed in front or behind the buccal cavity or mouth, the former being known as the pre-oral, and the latter as the ]jost-oral or visceral arches. Four clefts on each side appear laterally in the undifferentiated somato-splanchno-pleural wall of the fore-gut, and between them thickenings occur which ultimately meet and fuse in the middle line, and above are connected with the investing mass. These are the so-called post-oral vis- ceral arches. Differen- tiation of tissue occurs from above downwards, and cartilage is formed in them in connection with the investing mass. The first post- oral arch has no cleft in front of it, but forms a rim in front of the fore-gut. The pre-oral arches are formed in much the same way by local thickening, in which differentiation of tissue and formation of cartilage proceeds in a direction forwards and downwards from the in- vesting mass. The ijre-oral or maxillary arcli unites with the fronto-nasal process. The latter con- sists of three plates, a central single one and two lateral ones. The central is called the ^ mid-frontal' process. It is prolonged down- wards and forwards from the middle of the base of the skull, from the point of coalescence of nose is developed. .

The lateral plates of the fronto-nasal process are separated from the central one by a depression or furrow on either side ; these furrows form the primary nasal pits or fossae. The lateral plates project downwards parallel to the mid-process for a certain distance, and then, curving inwards, unite with it, thus shutting off the nasal fossae from the rest of the face. The lateral masses of the ethmoid and lachrymal bones are developed in the lateral plates, and by their union with the mid-frontal process form the intermaxillary bone and the lunula, or central part of the upper hp. The maxillary processes spring from the base of the skull further back thanGENERAL ANATOMY 88 Fig. 92.—Face of an embryo of 25 to 28 days. Magnified 15 times. the fronto-nasal process, and at their origin are closely connected with the first post- oral or \dsceral arch. They descend for a short distance, forming the outer wall of the orbit, in which the malar bone is developed; they then incline inwards, and, meeting the lateral plate of the fronto-nasal process, form the floor of the orbit, and shut it off from the rest of the face ; then, continuing their course downwards and inwards, they join the mid-frontal process, and with it complete the alveolar arch and the superior maxillary bone. Finally, palatal processes are formed by an extension of the inner sides of this arch ; these coalesce with each other in the median line, thus separating the cavity of the mouth from the nasal fossae, and completing the palate. In front, however, the palatal processes do not join with the mid-frontal process, but a cleft is left which constitutes the naso-pala- tine canal. The 2^ost-oral arches are five in num- ber in the amniota, and of these the first only is concerned in the formation of the face proper, for the lower jaw or mandible is developed from it, and hence it is called the mandibular arch. The second is named the hyoid arch : from it is formed the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid liga- ment, and the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. The third, or thyro-hyoid arch, gives origin to the great cornu of the hyoid bone, while the body of this bone is formed between the second and third arches. This third arch, together with the fourth and fifth, correspond to the arches which, in fishes and amphibia, form the gill-plates, but which, in the amniota, never do so. They are appropriately named branchial, a name which was primarily given to the whole series by Rathke, who first described them. The deeper part of the first or mandibular arch contains a transitory cartila- ginous rod, which has long been known as the ' cartilage of Meckel,' the proximal end of which is at first attached to the basis cranii, and afterwards to the periotic capsule. It is, during some part of foetal life, directly continuous with the malleus, which by some is believed to be developed from it. The median end of the lower jaw-bone is developed from this cartilage ; the greater part of the rest of the bone being developed from membrane. Between the mandibular arch and the pre-oral arch the buccal cavity or mouth is formed; this therefore owes its origin to the formation of the pre-oral and post-oral arches, and consists of mesoblastic tissue lined by epiblast. As has been already stated (page 76) the cephalic end of the embryo becomes remarkably curved on itself, the fore- and mid-brain bending downwards over the anterior portion of the original blastodermic membrane which remains within the body of the embryo and from which the fore-gut is to be developed. This fore-gut terminates as a blind extremity beneath the head (fig. 91, a,/). Another prominence forms on the ventral surface of the fore-gut, which represents the rudimentary heart (fig. 91, A, h)» Between these two prominences, caused by the projection of the fore-brain and the heart, an involution of the epiblast takes place, gradually deepening until it comes in contact with the upper part of the alimentary canal. This is the stomodcBum, or mouth, which becomes bounded by prominences, constituting the pre-oral and mandibular arches. It is at first quite distinct from the upper part Froutal prominence. 2, 3.

A commmiication between the two is, however, gradually effected by the absorption of these layers at the anterior extremity of the primitive alimentary cavity, and the hinder portion of the epiblastic involution from which the mouth is formed. Between each of these visceral arches are clefts, four in number, which run through the tissues of the neck to the cavity of the pharynx; the first persists, though only in a portion of its extent, forming the Eustachian tube, the meatus auditorius, and the tympanic cavity. The other fissures are wholly closed by the sixth week. Development of the Nervous Centres and the Nerves.—The medullary groove above described (page 75) presents, about the third week, three dilatations at its upper end, separated by two constrictions, and at its posterior part another dila- tation called the rJiomboidal sinus. Soon after- wards the groove becomes a closed canal (medid- Fig. 93.—Section of the medulla lary canal) and a soft blastema lines it, exhibit- ing corresponding dilatations. This is the rudi- ment of the cerebro-spinal axis. As the embryo grows, its cephalic part becomes more curved, and the three dilatations at the anterior end of the primitive cerebro-spinal axis become vesicles distinctly separated from each other (fig. 90). These are the cerebral vesicles—anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior cerebral vesicle (situ- ated, at this period, quite below the middle vesicle) is the rudiment of the third ventricle, and of the parts surrounding it, viz. the optic thalami, and all the parts which form the floor of the third ventricle. The middle vesicle represents the aqueduct of Sylvius, with the corpora quadrige- mina. The posterior vesicle is developed into the fourth ventricle, and its walls form the pons Varolii, medulla oblongata, and the parts in the floor of the fourth ventricle. At an early period in the development of this primitive brain, a protrusion takes place from the anterior vesicle, which is at first simple, but soon becomes divided into two parts by an antero-posterior fissure. These expand laterally, and the cerebral hemispheres and corpora striata are developed from them. From the fore-part of the posterior cerebral vesicle a similar protrusion takes place, forming the rudiment of the cerebellum. In consequence of these protrusions or outgrowths taking place, the three primary cerebral vesicles are now converted into six permanent rudiments of the brain and medulla oblongata. The anterior part of the original anterior cerebral vesicle (fore-brain, prosencephalon), now divided into two, constitutes the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, corpora striata, fornix, lateral ventricles, and olfactory bulbs. These parts lie at first quite covered and concealed by those formed from the middle primary vesicle, and by the optic thalami, which, with the optic nerves, the third ventricle and the parts in its floor, are furnished by the posterior portion of the anterior vesicle (inter-brain, thalamencephalon). By the third month, however, the hemispheres have risen above the optic thalami, and by the sixth month above the cerebellum. Fissures are seen on the surface of the hemispheres at the third month, but all except one disappear. This one persists, and forms the fissure of Sylvius. The permanent fissures for the convolutions do not form till about the seventh or eighth month. The middle cerebral vesicle (mid-brain, mesencephalon) is at first situated at the summit of the angle shown on fig. 90. Its smooth surface is soon in the cervical region, at six weeks.

Its cavity diminishes as its walls thicken, and contracts to form the aqueduct of Sylvius. The crura cerebri are also formed from this vesicle. The third primary cerebral vesicle, at an early period (between the ninth and twelfth week), consists | of the hind-brain or epencephalon, forming the cerebellum, pons Varolii, and anterior part of the fourth ventricle; and of the after-brain or metencephalon, which forms the medulla oblongata with the rest of the fourth ventricle. The development of the pituitary body has of late received much attention. It j is mainly formed by a diverticulum from the buccal involution of epiblast. At its \ upper and front part this involution, from which the mouth or stomodaeum is I developed, forms a hollow saccular protrusion, which extends into the angle formed j by the bend of the fore- with the mid-brain. Here it comes in contact with a | median hollow protrusion, which passes downwards and backwards from the posterior portion of the anterior cerebral vesicle (fig. 91, c, if). They become j intimately connected, and together form the pituitary body or hypophysis. j When the medullary groove is first closed, the foetal spinal marrow occupies its whole length, and presents a large central canal, which gradually contracts in ! consequence of the thickening and rapid growth of the epiblast around it. This increase in thickness takes place principally at the sides, so that eventually the central canal acquires on section the appearance of a slit. According to some < investigators, the two sides of this slit eventually join in the middle, and the original canal is divided into two : an anterior, which becomes the central permanent ! canal, which in after-life is no longer perceptible to the eye, though it is still ( visible on microscopic section ; and a posterior, which becomes filled about the ' ninth Aveek with a septum of connective tissue from the pia mater, and forms the { posterior fissure of the cord. According to other observers, the posterior fissure is i formed independently of the central canal, as a cleft formed by the enlarging i lateral halves of the cord, into which an ingrowth of connective tissue from the 1 pia mater takes place. The anterior fissure is apparently formed in this latter „ manner, simply as a cleft left between the lateral halves of the cord. i After the fourth month the spinal column begins to grow in length more \ rapidly than the medulla spinalis, so that the latter no longer occupies the whole | canal. The cord is composed at first entirely of uniform-looking cells, which soon \ separate into two layers, the inner of which forms the epithelium of the central 1 canal, while the outer forms the central grey substance of the cord. The white columns are formed later ; their rudiments can be detected about the fourth week, and some embryologists believe that they are developed from the mesoblast. I The cerebral and spinal membranes are, according to Kolliker, a production from the protovertebral discs, and are recognisable about the sixth week. As the fissures ' separating the segments of the cerebro-spinal axis appear, the membranes extend , through them, and the pia mater passes into the cerebral ventricles. Bischoff, • however, describes the pia mater and arachnoid as developed from the cerebral vesicles, so that they are, according to him, formed in the position which they | permanently occupy. ; The Nerves.—The nerves are developed, like the rest of the nervous system, ! from epiblast. The spinal nerves are developed as follows :—Close to the point | of involution of the epiblast in the median line, that is to say, in the angle of j junction of the neural and general epibJast, a cellular swelling constituting the j neural crest appears and forms a continuous ridge on the dorsal aspect of the j neural canal. On this crest enlargements occur, corresponding with the middle j of each protovertebral segment. These grow downwards between the neural canal and the mesoblastic tissue forming the protovertebrte, and occupy a position on the i lateral wall of the canal. These enlargements are the rudiments of the ganglion i of the posterior root; they are at first attached to the neural crest from which they spring, but subsequently this attachment becomes lost, and they then form isolated masses on either side of the neural canal, which now contains the rudimentary s91 DEVELOPMENT OF THE EYE cord. They consist of oval cells, from either end of which a process eventually I springs ; one, passing centrally, grows into the embryonic cord and constitutes the posterior root of the nerve ; the other, growing peripherally, joins the fibres of the anterior root to form the spinal nerve. The anterior root is, according to the recent researches of His, a direct outgrowth of certain cells which are found in the rudimentary cord and which are named I neuroblasts. These cells, like those mentioned above, are oval, and have a prolongation directed outwards towards the surface of the cord. These processes ' pass out of the cord in bundles and penetrate the mesoblast and join with fibres : of the posterior root and from the point of union the nerve grows towards its peripheral termination. Most of the cranial nerves are developed in the same manner as the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. That is to say, the neural crest, developed from the epiblast, is continued onwards, along the dorsal surface of the cephalic portion of ; the neural tube, as far as the mid-brain. From this a series of swellings at I irregular intervals form the rudimentary ganglia, from the polar cells of which the nerve is formed and its connection with the brain established. This appears I to be the case with the third, fifth, the facial, the auditory, the glosso-pharyngeal, I and the pneumogastric and probably the fourth. With regard to the mode of origin of the sixth, the spinal accessory and the hypoglossal, our knowledge is not so exact, but they would appear to arise, like the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, from groups of oval cells (neuroblasts) in the basal laminae. The olfactory tract and bulb is a protrusion of the antero-ventral part of each cerebral hemisphere. This protrusion comes in contact with the thickened epiblast of the olfactory area (see page 94), from which neuroblastic cells, which are formed within the area, pass out and form a ganglion between the area and the olfactory bulb. From this ganglion cell-processes grow centripetally to form the nerve-roots, and centrifugally to form the olfactory nerves which ramify on the I Schneiderian membrane. j The optic nerve arises in a manner entirely different from any of the other cranial nerves, as a hollow outgrowth of the brain, which subsequently becomes solid. It will be considered in connection with the development of the eye. I The sympathetic nerves are developed as outgrowths from the gangiiated roots ! of the spinal and cranial nerves. Development of the Eye.—The nervous elements and non-vascular parts of i the eye are formed from the epiblast, and the vascular portions from the meso- blast ; but the method of development is somewhat complicated. The essential portion of the eye—i.e. the retina and the parts immediately connected with it —is an outgrowth from the rudimentary brain (primitive ocular vesicle), and this outgrowth is met by an ingrowth from the common epidermic or corneous layer of the epiblast, out of which the lens and the conjunctival and corneal epithelium ; are developed. The first appearance of the eye consists in the protrusion or evolution from I the medullary wall of the thalamencephalon, or inter-brain, of a vesicle, called the primitive ocular vesicle. This is at first an open cavity communicating by a ' hollow stalk with the general cavity of the cerebral vesicle. As development advances the hollow stalk becomes solid, and thus the optic nerve is formed, receiving, how- ever, in a way presently to be explained, mesoblastic elements for the formation I of its central artery and connective tissue. As the primitive ocular vesicle is pro- longed forwards, it meets the epidermic layer of the epiblast, which at the point of contact becomes thickened, and then forms a depression which gradually encroaches on the most prominent part of the primitive ocular vesicle, which in its turn appears to recede before it, so as to become at first depressed and then inverted in the manner indicated by the annexed figure (fig. 94, a), so that the cavity is I finally almost obliterated by the folding back of its anterior half, and the original sac converted into a cup-shaped cavity, the ocular cup, in which the involuted epiblastic layer, the rudiment of the lens, is received (fig. 94, b). This cup-GENERAL ANATOMY 92 shaped cavity consists therefore of two layers: one, the outer, originally the posterior half of the primitive ocular vesicle, is thin, and eventually forms the pigmental layer of the retina ; * the other layer, the inner, originally the anterior or more prominent half, which has become folded back, and is much thicker, is converted into the nervous layers of the retina. Between the two are the remains of the cavity of the original primary vesicle, which finally becomes obli- terated by the union of its two layers. As development proceeds the cup-shaped cavity or ocular cup increases in size, and thus a space is formed between it and the rudimentary lens which it contains ; this is the secondary ocular vesicle, and in it the vitreous humour is developed (fig. 94, c). The folding in of the primary optic vesicle to produce the optic cup proceeds from above downwards, and gradually surrounds the lens, but leaves an aperture or fissure below, the cJioroiclal fissure or ocular cleft, through which vascular elements, within the vesicle and derived from the mesoblast, retam their connection with the rest of the mesoblast. This gap or cleft is continued for some distance into the stalk of the optic vesicle and thus allows a process of the mesoblast to extend down the stalk to form the arteria centralis retinae and its accompanying vein. The lens is at first a thickening of the epiblast, then a depression or involution takes place, thus forming an open follicle, the margins of which gradually approach each other and Fig. 95.—Diagrammatic sketch of a vertical longitudinal section through the eyeball of a human foetus of four weeks.

At the point of involution the external layer of epiblast separates from the ball of the lens and passes freely over the surface, so that the lens becomes disconnected from the epiblastic layer from which it was developed, and recedes into the ocular cup, while ! the cuticular layer covering it is developed into the corneal epithelium. The cells j forming the posterior or inner wall of the cavity, which is to form the lens, rapidly ! increase in size, becoming elongated and developed into fibres, and, filling up the I cavity, convert it into a sohd body. The cells on the anterior wall undergo no j change and retain their cellular character. The secondary ocular vesicle, or space \ between the lens and the hollow of the ocular cup (fig. 94, c, 7, and 95), contains a quantity of mesoblastic tissue continuous through the ocular cleft with the rest of the mesoblast, and into this blood-vessels project themselves through the ocular cleft. The iris and cihary processes are formed from this vascular tissue, and the choroid is developed in the mesoblast surrounding the ocular vesicle. A portion of this tissue also becomes converted into the vitreous humour, and surrounds the lens * This layer forms functionally part of the choroid, and was formerly described as belongmg to this membrane ; it is now described as part of the retina, on account of its method of development.DEVELOPMENT OF THE EAR 93 ■ with a vascular membraue—the vascular capsule of the lens, which is connected with the termination of the temporary artery (hyaloid) that forms the continua- tion of the central artery of the retina through the vitreous chamber. This vascular capsule of the crystalline lens forms the membrana pupillaris (described on a subsequent page), and also attaches the borders of the iris to the capsule of the lens. It disappears about the seventh month. The eyelids are formed at the end of the third month, as small cutaneous folds, which come together and unite in front of the globe and cornea. This union is broken up and the eyelids separate before the end of foetal life. The lachrymal canal appears to result from the non-closure of a fissure which exists between the lateral plates of the fronto-nasal and maxillary processes. Born, i however, considers that it is formed by a thickening of the deeper layer of the epidermis which sinks into the corium and subsequently becomes hollowed out into a tube. Development of the Ear.—The first rudiment of the ear appears shortly after that of the eye, in the form of a thickening of the epiblast, on the outside of that ' part of the third primary cerebral vesicle which eventually forms the medulla oblongata, opposite the dorsal end of the second pharyngeal arch. The thickening is then followed by an involution of the epiblast, which becomes deeper and deeper, sinking towards the base of the skull, and a flask-shaped cavity is formed ; by the narromng of the external aperture the neck of the flask constitutes the recessus labyrinthi. The mouth of the flask then becomes closed, and thus a shut sac is I formed, t\iQ primitive auditory or otic vesicle, which by its sinking inwards comes to be placed between the ali-sphenoid and basi-occipital matrices. From it the internal ear is formed. The middle ear and the Eustachian tube are developed ' from the remains of the first branchial cleft, while the pinna and external meatus are developed from the soft parts overhanging the posterior margin of the same cleft. ! The primary otic vesicle becomes embedded in a mass of mesoblastic tissue, which rapidly undergoes chondrification and ossification. It, as before stated, is at first flask- or pear-shaped ; the neck of the flask, or recessus lahyrinthi, prolonged back- wards, forms the aquaeductus vestibuli. From it are given off certain prolongations or diverticula, from which the various parts of the labyrinth are formed. One from the anterior end gradually elongates, and, forming a tube, bends on itself from left to right and becomes the cochlea. Three others, which appear on the surface of the vesicle, form the semicircular canals. Of these, the one which is to I constitute the external semicircular canal does not appear at such an early date as ! the other two. Subsequently, a constriction takes place in the original vesicle, j which, gradually increasing, divides it into two, and from these are formed the : utricle and saccule. Finally, the auditory nerve, which has been developed from i the 'neural crest' in the manner above described (page 91), pierces the auditory capsule in two main divisions—one for the vestibule, the other for the cochlea. [ The middle ear and Eustachian tube are the remains of the first pharyngeal or I branchial cleft (hyo-mandibular), and are, from an early period, closed by the formation of the membrana tympani, which consists of a layer of epiblast exter- nally, a layer of hypoblast internally, and between the tw^o of mesoblastic tissue constituting its fibrous and vascular layer. With regard to the exact mode of development of the ossicles of the middle ear there is considerable difference of opinion. By some the malleus is believed to be developed from the proximal end j of the mandibular (Meckel's) cartilage, and the incus from the proximal end of the hyoidean cartilage. Others, again, believe that they are both developed from the mandibular cartilage. A third group of observers believe that they are developed from a hyo-mandibular cartilage, similar to that w^hich in some of the loAver 1 animals forms a suspensory apparatus for both mandibular and hyoidean arches. The stapes is believed by some to be formed by a deposit of cartilaginous cells I around the fenestra ovalis ; by others it is supposed to be developed from the proximal end of the hyoidean arch. The external auditory meatus is developed, liKe the pinna, from the soft partsGENEEAL ANATOMY 94 on the posterior margin of the first visceral cleft by an outgrowth of the tissues in this situation. Development of the Nose.—The olfactory fossag, like the primary auditory vesicles, are formed in the first instance by a thickening and involution of the epiblast, which takes place at a point below and in front of the ocular vesicle (fig. 92, 2, 3). The thickening appears at a very early period, about the fourth week, j The borders of the involuted portion very soon become prominent, in consequence i of the development of the mid-frontal and lateral naso-frontal plates above spoken j of (page 87), which are formed on either side of the rudimentary fossae. As these j processes increase, the fossse deepen and become converted into a deep channel, j which eventually forms the upper part of the nasal fossae—that is, the two superior | meatuses, the part to which the olfactory nerves are distributed. At this time | they are continuous with the buccal cavity, a portion of which forms the lower ^ part, or inferior meatus of the nasal fossae. For as the palatine septum is formed, ! the buccal cavity is divided into two parts, the upper of which forms the lower part j of the nasal fossae, while the remainder forms the permanent mouth. The soft parts of the nose are formed from the coverings of the frontal pro- ' jections and of the olfactory fossae. The nose is perceptible about the end of the ' second month. The nostrils are at first closed by epithelium, but this disappears about the fifth month. The olfactory nerve, as above pointed out, is formed from the anterior cerebral) vesicle, as a secondary vesicle on its under surface, and it lies upon the involuted ! epiblast, which subsequently forms the nasal fossae. Development of the Skin, Glands, and Soft Parts.—^The epidermis is produced from the external, the true skin from the middle, blastodermic layer (fig. 79, 19, 20). About the fifth week the epidermis presents two layers, the deeper one correspond- | ing to the rete mucosum. The subcutaneous fat forms about the fourth month, ; and the papillae of the true skin about the sixth. A considerable desquamation of. epidermis takes place during foetal life, and this desquamated epidermis, mixed with a sebaceous secretion, constitutes the vernix caseosa, with which the skin is | smeared during the last three months of foetal life. The nails are formed at the j third month, and begin to project from the epidermis about the sixth. The hairs I appear between the third and fourth month in the form of depressions of thei deeper layer of the epithelium, which then become inverted by a projection from I the papillary layer of the skin. The papillae grow into the interior of the epithe- lial layer ; and finally, about the fifth month, the foetal hairs {lanugo) appear first, on the head and then on the other parts. These hairs drop oft' after birth, and I give place to the permanent hairs. The cellular structure of the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands is formed from the epithelial layer, while the connective tissue and blood-vessels are derived from the mesoblast about the fifth or sixth month. \ The mammary gland is also formed : partly from mesoblast—its blood-vessels and; connective tissue ; and partly from epiblast—its cellular elements. Its first rudi-1 ment is seen about the third month, in the form of a small projection inwards| of epithelial elements, which invade the mesoblast; from this, similar tracts of i cellular elements radiate; these subsequently give rise to the glandular follicles; and ducts. The development of the former, however, remains imperfect, except j in the adult female, and especially after pregnancy. 1| Development of the Limbs.—The upper and lower limbs begin to project, asi buds, from the anterior and posterior part of the embryo about the fourth week.ij These buds are formed by a projection of the somatopleure (i.e. the outer layer ofi the mesoblast and the epiblast) from the point where the mesoblast splits into itsj parietal and visceral layers, just external to the vertebral somites, of which theyij may be regarded as lateral extensions. The division of the terminal portion ofj the bud into fingers and toes is early indicated, and soon a notch or constrictionj marks the future separation of the hand or foot from the fore-arm or leg. Next, al similar groove appears at the site of the elbow or knee. The indifferent tissue oi| blastema, of which the whole projection is at first composed, is differentiated intdj95 DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART muscle and cartilage, before the appearance of any internal cleft for the joints between the chief bones. The muscles become visible about the seventh or eighth week. The source of their development is not completely determined for the muscles of the limbs. The vertebral muscles appear to be developed from the ' muscle-plates ' of the primitive vertebral discs (page 76, see fig. 79, c, 13), and the muscles of the neck and jaws, as well as those which enclose the cavities of the thorax and abdomen, are also formed from the same source. They do not meet in the middle line of the body till about the fourth month. The cutaneous muscles are developed from the cutaneous portion of the middle blastodermic layer. Development of the Blood-vascular System.—There are three distinct stages in the development of the circulatory system before it arrives at its complete or adult condition, in accordance with the manner in which nourishment is provided for at different periods of the existence of the individual. In the first stage there is the vitelline circulation, during which nutriment is extracted from the yolk or contents of the vitelline membrane. In the second stage there is the ijlacental circulation, which commences after the formation of the placenta, and during which nutrition is obtained by means of this organ from the blood of the mother. In the third stage there is the complete circulation of the adult, commencing at birth, and during which nutrition is provided for by the organs of the individual itself. I. The vitelline circulation is carried on partly within the body of the embryo and partly external to it in the vascular area of the yolk. It consists of a median tubular heart, from which two vessels (arteries) project anteriorly. These carry the blood to a plexus of capillaries spread over the area vasculosa, and also, though to a less extent, in the body of the embryo. From this plexus the blood is returned by two vessels (veins) which enter the heart posteriorly, and thus a complete circulation is formed. In these vessels and the heart a fluid (blood) is contained, in which rudimentary corpuscles are found. The mode of formation of these elementary parts will have first to be considered. In mammalia the heart is formed by a hollowing out or vacuolation of a longi- tudinal group of mesoblastic cells on either side of the median line in front of the anterior extremity of the rudimentary pharynx, at about the level of the posterior primary cerebral vesicle. This vacuolation takes place in the visceral layer of the mesoblast, and round the cavity thus formed the layer becomes folded or reduplicated, and presents two distinct strata of cells ; the inner and thinner layer forms the endocardium, the outer and thicker the muscular wall of the heart. In its very earliest and primitive condition, the heart consists therefore of a pair of tubes, one on either side of the body. These, however, soon coalesce in the median line, and, fusing together, form a single central tube.* Each of the two primary tubes receives posteriorly a large vessel (a vein), and is prolonged anteriorly into a second vessel (an artery). So that after fusion of the heart-tubes has taken place, there is, in the primitive vitelline circulation, as above mentioned, a single tubular heart, with two arteries proceeding from it and two veins emptying themselves into it. The earliest vessels are also formed in the visceral layer of the mesoblast. They are developed from that part of the mesoblast which surrounds the portion of blastoderm which is occupied by the developing body of the embryo and w^hich is known as the 'vascular area.' So that the first blood-vessels are developed outside the body of the embryo. The indifferent cells of which this layer is composed become ' vacuo- lated,' that is, they become enlarged, and spaces are formed within them. The nuclei of these enlarged cells multiply; some few of the proliferated nuclei remain embedded in the walls of the cell, but the greater number of them are free and are converted into blood-corpuscles. The vacuolated cells fuse together, forming cavities, and also give off processes which unite with processes of other cells : * In most fishes and in amphibia the heart originates as a single median tube.GENEEAL ANATOMY 96 these in their turn become also vacuolated and, communicating with the cavities in the original cells, a network of tubes is produced (fig. 96). The tubes or primary vessels consist in the first instance of the original protoplasm of the cell, with here and there nuclei, derived from the original divided nucleus embedded in it. Then difierentiation of the protoplasm Fig. 96.—Various forms of mother-cells undergoing development into blood-vessels, from the middle layer of the chick's blasto- derm. (Klein.) a.

Mother-cell in which only obscure granular matter is found. into flattened cells around these nuclei takes place and constitutes the wall of the capillary or the lining mem- brane of the larger vessel. In these latter, other cells, derived from the mesoblast, apply themselves externally and form the other coats of the vessel at a later period. The blood-discs are formed from the original divided nucleus of the vacuolated mesoblastic cells. They are free, and accumulate, each one around itself, a small quantity of the proto- plasm of the cell, which rapidly acquires a tinge of colour. The earliest blood- corpuscles are therefore at first nucle- ated, and in this and other respects resemble the white corpuscles. As soon, however, as the liver is formed, true white corpuscles make their ap- pearance, and it seems that the chief source from which they are derived is the embryonic liver, though later on the spleen and lymphatic glands take up this function and continue it after birth. The nucleated condition of the red globules ceases before birth. The precise mode in which the nucleated white corpuscle is converted into the non-nucleated red blood-globule, whether by a change in the whole cell or by the disappearance of the cell and persistence of its nucleus, is not yet ascertained. The vitelline circulation commences about the fifteenth day and lasts till the fifth week. When fully established it is carried on as fol- lows :—Proceeding from the tubular heart are two arteries, the first aortic arteries (fig. 97), which unite at some distance from the heart into a single artery. This runs down in front of the primitive vertebne and in the walls of the in- testinal cavity, and again divides into two tive aortcE or vertebral arteries, and these give off five or six omphalo-mesenteric arteries, which ramify in that part of the blastoderm which surrounds the developing body of the embryo and which is known as the vascular area. They terminate peripherally in a circular vessel—the terminal sinus. This vessel surrounds the vas- cular portion of the germinal area, but does not extend up to the anterior end of the embryo. It terminates on either side in a vein called the omplialo-mesenteric. The two omphalo-mesen- teric veins open into the opposite extremity of the heart to that from which the arteries proceeded. 2. The Placental Circulation.—As the umbilical vesicle diminishes, the allantois, w^hich is formed by a protrusion from the lower part of the intestine, enlarges and becomes converted into a vascular chorion, a part of w^hich forms the placenta.

The allantois carries with it two arteries, derived from branches of the primitive aorta, and two veins; these vessels become much enlarged as the placental circulation is established, but subsequently one of the veins disappears and in the later stages of uterine life the circulation is carried on between the foetus and the placenta by two arteries and one vein {u'luhilical). During the occurrence of these changes great alterations take place in the primitive heart and blood-vessels, above alluded to, which will now require descrip- tion. Further Development of the Heart.—The simple median tube, formed by the coalescence of the pair of tubes of which the primitive heart consists, becomes elongated and bent on itself, so as to form a S-shaped tube, the anterior part of the tube bending over to the right, and the posterior to the left. At the same time the middle portion is protruded forwards and arches transversely from right to left and at the same time becomes twisted on itself so that the extremity from which the arteries are prolonged is situated in front and to the right, and that into which the veins enter is behind and to the left. The bent tube then becomes divided by two transverse constrictions into three parts. One, the posterior, becomes the auricles, the middle one forms the two ventricular cavities, while the anterior forms the aortic bulb, from which the commencement of the aorta and pulmonary artery is developed. A division of each of these cavities now takes place, so as to convert them into right and left ventricle, right and left auricle, and aorta and pulmonary artery respectively. This division first takes place in the middle portion of the tubular heart, the rudimentary ventricular cavities (fig. 97, a, 5). A partition rises up from the lower part of the right wall of this cavity, and gradually grows up until it reaches the constrictions which separate it from the other two, and thus the interventricular septum is completed. At the same time a cleft appears on the outside, a little to the right of the most prominent point, which ultimately becomes the apex of the heart. The cleft becomes less marked as development progresses, but remains, to some extent, persistent throughout life, as the interventricular groove. The first appearance of a division in the posterior or auricular portion of the tubular heart makes its appearance, at a very early period of development, in the shape of two projecting pouches, one on either side ; these are the rudiments of the auricular appendages, but the actual division of the cavity by a septum does not occur until some time after the appearance of the ventricular septum. This is formed by the growth of a partition from the anterior wall of the auricular cavity, which grows backwards, and partially separates the cavity into two. The partition, however, is not completed until after birth, a part remaining undeveloped, and thus permitting of a communication {foramen ovale) between the tvv'o auricles during the whole of foetal life. In a like manner, the aortic bulb is divided into two by the growth of a septum dow^nwards, from the distal end of the bulb, which divides the cavity into the permanent aorta and the pulmonary artery. Very soon a superficial furrow appears on the external surface of this portion of the heart corresponding to the septum internally, and, becoming deeper, the two vessels are gradually separated from each other through the septum, in the imme- diate neighbourhood of the ventricular portion of the heart, whilst beyond this they still remain joined together, and give origin to the fourth and fifth aortic arches, presently to be described. Further Development of the Arteries.—In the vitelline circulation, two arteries were described as coming off from the primitive heart, and running down in front of the developing vertebrae. The first change consists in the fusion of these arteries into one at some distance from the heart, thus forming the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. In consequence of the heart falling backwards to the lower part of the neck and then into the thorax, as the head is developed, the two original arteries, proceeding from the heart to the point of fusion in the common descending aorta, become elongated, and assume an arched form, curving HGENERAL ANATOMY 98 backwards on each side, from the front of the body towards the vertebral cohimn (fig. 98, a). These are the first or prnnitive aortic arches. As the heart recedes YiG. 98.—Diagram of the formation of the aortic arches and the large arteries. ir III IV. V.

In many animals the five pairs do not exist together, for the YiG. 99. Diagram to show the destination of the arterial arches in man and mammals. (Modified from Kathke.

Only some of the arches in mammalia remain as permanent structures ;DEVELOPMENT OF THE VEINS 99 other arches, or portions of them, become obhterated or disappear. The first two arches entirely disappear. The third remains as a part of the internal carotid artery, the remainder being formed by the upper part of the posterior aortic root, i.e. the descending part of the original vessel which proceeded from the rudimentary tubular heart. The common and external carotid are formed from the anterior aortic root, that is, the ascending portion of the same primitive vessel. The fourth arch on the left side becomes developed into the permanent arch of the aorta in mammals ; but in birds it is the fourth arch on the right side which forms the aortic arch ; while in reptiles the fourth arch on both sides persists, as there is a permanent double aortic arch. The fourth arch on the right side forms the subclavian artery, and by the junction of its commencement with the anterior aortic root, from which the common carotid is developed, it forms the innominate artery.* The fifth arch on the left side forms the pulmonary artery and the ductus arteriosus ; that on the right side becomes atrophied and disappears. The first part of the fifth left arch remains connected with that part of the bulbous aorta which is separated as the pulmonary stem, and with it forms the common pulmonary artery. From about the middle of this arch two branches are given off, which form the right and left pulmonary arteries respectively, and the remaining portion, i.e. the part beyond the origin of the branches, communicating Avith the left fourth arch—that is, the descending part of the arch of the aorta—constitutes the ductus arteriosus. This duct remains pervious during the whole of foetal life, and after birth becomes obliterated. The development of the arteries in the lower part of the body is going on during the same time. We have seen that originally there were two primitive arteries coming oft' from the primary tubular heart, and that these two vessels, at some distance from the heart, became fused together to form a single median artery, w4iich coursed down in front of the vertebrae to the bottom of the spinal column, forming the permanent descending aorta. From the extremity of this the two vitelline arteries, which were originally parts of the primitive main trunks, pass to the area vasculosa. As the umbilical vesicle dwindles and the allantois grows, two large branches are formed as lateral offshoots of the median aorta. These are the two umbilical or hypogastric arteries, and are concerned in the placental circulation. The portion of the median aorta beyond this point becomes much diminished in size, and eventually forms the sacra media artery, and thus the two umbilical branches become in appearance bifurcating branches of the main aorta. The common and internal iliac arteries are developed from the proximal end of these umbilical arteries; the middle portion of the vessel, after birth, becomes partially atrophied, but in part remains pervious as the superior vesical artery ; the distal portion becomes obliterated, constituting part of the superior ligament of the bladder. The external iliac and femoral arteries are developed from a small branch given off from the umbilical arteries near their origin, and are at first of comparatively small size. Development of the Veins.—The formation of the great veins of the embryo may be best considered under two groups, visceral and parietal. The visceral are derived from the vitelline and umbilical veins. In the earliest period of the circulation of the embryo, we have seen that there were two veins (vitelline or omphalo-mesenteric) returning the blood from the vitelline membrane. These unite together to form a single channel, the sinus venosus, which opens into the auricular extremity of the heart. As soon as the placenta begins to be formed, two umbilical veins appear and open into the sinus venosus, close to the vitelline veins. The two vitelline veins enter the abdomen and run upwards on either side of the intestinal canal; at the upper part of the abdomen, in the site of the future liver, which now begins to form around them, transverse communications are formed, which encircle the duodenum and enclose it in two vascular rings. The portion of veins above these vascular rings loses its connection with the sinus, * This is interesting in connection with the position of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is thus seen to hook round the same primitive fcetal structure, which becomes on the right side the subclavian artery, on the left the arch of the aorta. H 2GENERAL ANATOMY lOO whilst the portion between them breaks up into a capillary plexus, which ramifies in the now^ partially developed liver together wdth capillary vessels from the upper venous ring. Of these latter, some pass towards the heart and join the sinus. They have received the name of the vencB hejmticcB revehentes, and eventually become the hepatic veins ; others ramify in the liver, under the name of vencB Jieijaticm advehentes, and become the branches of the portal vein. The lower vascular ring receives veins from the stomach and intestines, and becomes the commencement of the portal vein. I The umbilical veins at first open into the sinus venosus near to the vitelline veins. Subsequently this communication becomes interrupted by the development i of a vascular network ; the vein on the right side atrophies and disappears, whilst [ that on the left side greatly enlarges, as the placental circulation becomes established, j and communicates with the upper venous circle of the vitelline circulation. Finally a branch is formed between the upper venous circle and the right hepatic veins, \ which becomes the ductus venosus, and by it most of the blood from the umbilical i vein is carried direct to the heart.

( After Daltou. > The Parietal Veins.—The first appearance of a parietal system consists in the appearance of two short transverse veins (the ducts of Cuvier), which open on either side of the auricular portion of the heart. Each of these ducts is formed by an ascending and descending vein. The ascending veins return the blood from the parietes of the trunk and the Wolffian bodies, and are called cardinal veins. | The two descending ones return the blood (fig. loo) from the head, and are called 'primitive jugular veins. As the kidneys are developed, the veins conveying the blood from them unite together to form a single trunk which passes up the abdomen | behind the intestines, and, joining the common trunk of the vitelline and umbihcal veins above the point of entrance of the venae revehentes, constitutes the inferior j vena cava. Two small veins receiving branches from the lower extremity unite to [ form the lower part of the inferior vena cava, below the point of entrance of the veins | from the kidneys. These are the primitive iliac veins, and in their course upwards j they cross the cardinal veins and communicate with them. The part of the iliac j vein betAveen this point of communication and their junction with one another jDEVELOPMENT OF ALIMENTAEY CANAL lOl constitutes the common iliac vein; while the distal portion forms the external iliac vein. The internal iliac vein is formed from that part of the cardinal vein which lies below the point of communication. The greater part of the remainder of the cardinal vein—that is to say, of that portion above the iliac veins—becomes obliterated ; a small part, however, at the upper extremity remains persistent, and becomes con- tinuous with two new veins, which are formed one on either side of the vertebral column. These veins receive the intercostal and lumbar veins, and eventually form the azygos veins. They become joined by an oblique communicating branch, which crosses the middle line, and constitutes the junction of the vena azygos minor with the vena azygos major. These veins are termed the j^osterior vertebral veins of Rathke. The upper part of the left one, with its continuation, the cardinal vein, forms the superior intercostal of the left side. The veins first formed in the upper part of the trunk are, as above stated, the primitive jugular veins. In the greater part of their extent they become the external jugular vein. Shortly, two loi.—Diagram of the formation of the main systemic veins. small branches may be noticed opening Fig. into them near their termination ; these form the subclavian and internal jugular veins. From the point of junction of these veins on the left side, a commu- nicating branch makes its appearance, running obliquely across the neck down- wards and to the right, to open into the primitive jugular vein of the right side below the point of entrance of the sub- clavian vein. At the same time, in con- sequence of the alteration in the position of the heart, and its descent into the thorax, the direction of the ducts of Cuvier becomes altered, and they assume an almost vertical position. From the por- tion of the primitive jugular veins, above the branch of communication, the inter- nal jugulars are formed, except that part of the right one which lies between the point of entrance of the subclavian of this side, and the termination of the commu- nicating branch, which becomes the right innominate vein. The communicating branch becomes the left innominate vein. The primitive jugular of the right side, below the communicating vein and the right duct of Cuvier, becomes the vena cava superior, into which the right car- dinal (vena azygos major) enters. The lower part of the left primitive jugular, and the left duct of Cuvier become almost entirely obhterated, except the lower end, which remains as a fibrous band, or sometimes a small vein, and runs obliquely over the posterior surface of the left auricle. The termination of the left duct of Cuvier remains persistent, and forms the coronary sinus (fig. loi). The foetal circulation is described at a future page. Development of the Alimentary Canal.—The development of the intestinal cavity is, as shown above (page 77), one of the earhest phenomena of embryonic life.

At either extremity it forms a closed tube, in consequence of the cephalic and caudal flexures (page 77), and this manifestly divides it into three parts; a front part, enclosed in the cephalic fold, called the fore-gut; a posterior part, enclosed in the caudal fold, the Jiind-gnt; and a central part or mid-gut, Fig. 102.—Diagrammatic outline of a longitudinal vertical section of the chick on the fourtli day. ep.

The ends of the fore- and hind-gut do not communicate with the surface of the body, the buccal and anal orifices being subsequently formed by involutions of the epiblast, which later on form communications with the gut. From the fore-gut are developed the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum; from the hind- gut a part of the rectum ; and from the middle division the rest of the in- testinal tube (fig. 103). The changes which take place in the fore-gut are as follow: The middle portion becomes dilated to form the stomach, and under- goes a vertical rotation to the right, so that the posterior border, by which it is attached to the vertebral column by a mesentery, is now directed to the left, and the anterior border to the right. At this time it is straight, but it soon undergoes a lateral curve or bend to the right at its upper end. It thus assumes an oblique direction, and the left border (originally the posterior or attached border) becomes inferior, and forms the great curvature. The mesentery by which it was attached forms the great omentum. The por- tion of the fore-gut above this dilata- tion remains straight, forming the pharynx and oesophagus, and in conse- quence of the mesoblast being here un- divided, there is no serous investment to this part of the tube. Below this, division of the mesoblast has taken place, and the splanchnopleure alone forms the walls of the remainder of the intestinal canal, the space between this layer and the somatopleure constituting the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. The part of the fore-gut below the dilated stomach forms the duodenum, and in connection with this the liver and pancreas are developed.

The posterior part of tlie intestine.DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIVER The hind-gut is also a closed tube, and from it the middle third of the rectum is developed, as well as the allantois (page 8i), which will be again referred to in connection with the development of the bladder. The mid-gut is at first an open cavity freely communicating with the umbilical vesicle. As the body-walls grow, this communication contracts very materially, though it still exists to a certain extent, and the open cavity becomes converted into a straight tube, still open where it communicates with the umbilical vesicle. This tube grows rapidly in length, and presents a primitive curve or loop down- wards and forwards, and, in consequence of its growth exceeding that of the walls of the body-cavity, a portion of the loop protrudes into the stalk of the umbilical vesicle. At a subsequent period, however, the walls of the abdomen grow more rapidly than the intestine, which again recedes into the body-cavity. At a short distance below the most prominent point of this loop a diverticulum arises, which marks the separation between the large and small intestine. The lower part of this diverticulum forms the vermiform appendix ; the proximal part, by its continued growth, constitutes the caecum. After this the anterior or upper part of the gut, corresponding to the small intestine, rapidly increases in length, and about the eighth week becomes convoluted. The lower or posterior part, corresponding to the large intestine, is at first less in calibre than the upper part, and lies wholly to the left side of the convolutions of the small intestine; but later on the curve of the large intestine begins to form, and the first part (ascending colon) slowly crosses over to the right side, first lying in the middle line, just below the liver. It is not until the sixth month that the caecum descends into the right iliac fossa, and so drags the ascending colon into its normal position in the right flank. The peritoneal cavity is the space left between the visceral and parietal layers of the mesoblast, and the serous membrane is developed from these structures. The mesenteries are formed from mesoblastic tissue extending between the notochord and the gut which develops the vascular and connective-tissue elements of these parts. The buccal cavity is formed by an involution of the external layers of the blastodermic membrane, which passes inwards and meets the pharynx, or upper part of the fore-gut. The tAvo cavities are, however, at first completely separated from each other by all the layers of the blastoderm; but at an early period of development a vertical slit appears between them ; this gradually widens and becomes the opening by Avhich the common cavity of the nose and mouth commu- nicates with the pharynx. The common cavity is afterwards divided into nose and mouth by the development of the palate, in the manner spoken of above. The tongue appears about the fifth week as a small elevation behind the inferior maxillary arch, to which another projection from the second pharyngeal arch is united. The epithelial layer is furnished by the epiblast. The tonsils appear about the fourth month. The anus is also formed by an inflection of the epiblast, w^hich extends inwards to a slight extent, and approaches the termination of the hind-gut, and finally com- municates with it by a solution of continuity in the septum between the two. The persistence of the foetal septum at either the buccal or anal orifices constitutes a well-known deformity—imperforate oesophagus or imperforate rectum, as the case may be. The liver appears after the VV^olffian bodies, about the third week, in the form of a bifid mass of cells, connected with the epithelial and mesoblastic layers of the splanchnopleure. It projects from the intestine at that part which afterwards forms the duodenum. This mass of cells becomes hollowed out into a cavity, lined by hypoblast, the rudiment of the main duct of the liver, the cells on either side being developed into the right and left lobes. These grow very rapidly around the vitelline and, later, the umbilical veins, which break up into a capillary plexus and ramify in its substance. About the third month the liver .almost fills the abdominal cavity. From this period the relative development of the liver is less active, more especially that of the left lobe, which now becomes smaller than theGENEEAL ANATOMY right; but the liver remains up to the end of foetal life relatively larger than in the adult. The gall-bladder appears about the second month, as an extension of the cavity from which the main duct of the liver is developed; and bile is detected in the intestines by the third month. The 'i^ancreas is also an early formation, being far advanced in the second month. It, as well as the salivary glands, which appear about the same period, j originates in a projection from the epithelial layer, which afterwards forms a | cavity, and the lobules of the gland are developed from the ramifications of this j cavity. It is generally admitted that the epithelial lining of the ducts is furnished j by the hypoblast, in the development of both the pancreas and the liver; and that j the vessels owe their origin to the mesoblast. But authorities differ as to the mode j of formation of the parenchyma, as to whether this is entirely of mesoblastic j origin, or whether the hypoblast shares in its development. I The spleen, on the other hand, is apparently entirely of mesoblastic origin, for , there is never any connection between the intestinal cavity and the substance of | this organ. It originates from the mesenteric fold which connects the stomach | to the vertebral column (mesogastrium). j Development of the Respiratory Organs.—The lungs appear somewhat later ■ than the liver. They are developed from a small median cul-de-sac or diverticu- lum from the upper part of the fore-gut, immediately behind the fourth visceral i cleft, as a projection from the epithelial and fibrous laminae of the intestines. ' During the fourth week a pouch is formed on either side of the central diver- ticulum, and opens freely through it into the fore-gut (pharynx). From these, other (secondary) pouches are given off, so that by the eighth week the form of the | lobes of the lungs may be made out. The two primary pouches have thus a I common pedicle of communication with the pharynx. This is developed into the i trachea (fig. 97, b), the cartilaginous rings of which are perceptible about the, seventh week. The parts which afterwards form the larynx are recognised as early as the sixth week—viz. a projection on either side of the pharyngeal open- ing, which is the rudiment of the arytenoid cartilage and a transverse elevation | from the third pharyngeal arch, which afterwards becomes the epiglottis ; the! vocal cords and ventricles of the larynx are seen about the fourth month. Traces of the diaphragm appear in the form of a fine membrane, separating the lungs \ from the Wolffian bodies, the stomach and the liver, whilst the heart is still near the head. As the diaphragm extends forwards from the vertebral column it, separates the common pleuro-peritoneal cavity into two parts, a thoracic andi abdominal. Development of the Urinary Organs.—The urinary organs appear to be entirely of mesoblastic origin, and are intimately connected with an embryonic glandular, organ first discovered by Wolff, and hence called the Wolffian body. Recent researches have shown that the Wolffian bodies form a part of a set of glands which are found in all vertebrate and some invertebrate animals. These glands | have been termed the segviental organs, and consist, in vertebrates, of branching! tubes opening at one extremity into the body-cavity, and at the other by one or j more main ducts into the cloaca or hind-gut.* The segmental organ of vertebrates! is divided into three parts, each of which possesses an excretory duct. The anterior i of the three, situated in the region of the rudimentary heart, is termed the head- kidney OT i:)ronephros (Lankester), and its duct is the Miillerian duct. The central part is the Wolffian body, the mesonephros (Lankester), and its duct is the Wolffianj duct. The posterior segment is the rudiment of the permanent kidney, and isf formed later than the other two. It is named the metanephros (Lankester), and its! duct is the ureter. 1 The segmental organ is perceptible about the third week, forming an elongated} ridge of cells situated on either side of the primitive vertebrae and extending from j I * In invertebrates the external openings are on the sides of the body. jjDEVELOPMENT OF THE UEINAEY ORGANS the heart to the lower end of the embryo. It makes its appearance below the heart and behind the common plenro-peritoneal cavity, from the mesoblast at the point of separation of its two layers into somatopleure and splanchnopleure. As this ridge is situated in front of the epiblast (reflected from the medullary cavity) ^at the side of the protovertebr^e and behind the common pleuro-peritoneal cavity, it has been named ' the intermediate cell-mass.' It is at first solid, but soon a tube is hollowed out in it, by the formation of a lumen in its most prominent part; this is the segmental duct, the greater part of which forms the Wolffian duct. As the duct is formed it sinks downwards and projects into the body- cavity. The remainder of the segmental organ, i.e. that part which is not concerned in the formation of the duct, becomes converted into tubes, which commence as branches from the duct and spread out at right angles with it. They are at first caecal, but soon acquire openings at their inner extremities into the body-cavity; the lower end of the segmental duct at the same time forming an opening into the urogenital sinus. Thus a communication is established through these tubes and duct between the pleuro-peritoneal cavity and the cloaca or hinder part of the alimentary canal. The next step is the formation of a second duct in the neighbourhood of the original duct, with which some of the tubules of the anterior part of the segmental body (pronephros) are connected. This is the Miillerian duct. The ureter which is formed later is an offshoot from the hinder part of the Wolffian duct. The structure of the Wolffian body is in many respects analogous to that of the permanent kidney (fig. 104). It is composed partly of an excretory canal or duct, into which open numerous ' conduits,' rectilinear at first, but afterwards tortuous, and partly of a cellular or glandular structure, in which Mal- pighian tufts are found. It is fixed to the diaphragm by a superior ligament, and to the spinal column by an in- ferior or lumbar ligament. Its office is the same as that of the kidneys—viz. to secrete fluid containing urea, which accumulates in the bladder. When the permanent kidneys are formed, the greater part of the Wolffian body disappears. The rest takes part in the formation of the organs of generation. The functional activity of the Wolf- fian bodies is very transitory; they attain their highest development by the sixth week, after which time they begin to decrease in size and have nearly disappeared by the end of the third month. The upper part of the segmental body, the pronephros, also undergoes atrophy and disappears. In the male, the Wolffian duct persists, and becomes converted into the vas deferens, the Miillerian duct undergoing atrophy ; a vestige of it, however, remaining as the sinus prostaticus ; whereas, on the other hand, in the female, the Miillerian duct remains and becomes converted into the whole length of the genital passages, while the Wolffian duct almost entirely disappears and remains only as a vestige. Prior to this, however, the Wolffian and Miillerian ducts (together with the ureter when formed) open into the common urogenital sinus or cloaca, which is the termination of the intestinal cavity, into which the allantois also opens in front (fig. 105). As the allantois expands into the urinary bladder this common cavity is divided ' into two by a septum, to form the bladder in front and the rectum behind. The Wolfiian and Miillerian ducts are soon connected by cellular substance into a single mass—the genital cord—in which the Wolffian ducts lay side by side in front, and the ducts of Miiller behind, at first separate, but later on uniting with each other.

Fig. 105.—Diagram of the primitive m'ogenital organs in the embryo previous to sexual distinction. The parts are shown chiefly in profile, but the Miillerian and Wolffian ducts are seen from the front. It has been stated that the kidney is developed from the lower part (meta- nephros) of the segmental organ. With this the ureter becomes connected in the following manner. It commences as a tubular diverticulum from the lower part of the segmental duct, close to the cloaca. It extends upwards and becomes divided into a number of csecal tubules, which represent the commencement of the several divisions of the pelvis of the kidney. These tubules are prolonged into the solid blastema of which the kidney at that time consists. The tubules then become convoluted, and masses of cells accumulate on their exterior, so as to give to the organ an appearance of lobulation. Between these cells vessels are developed, and the vascular glomeruli are gradually formed. The kidneys at first, therefore, consist of cortical substance only, but later on the proximal ends of the tubes become straight and arranged in bundles, and thus the pyramidal structure is developed. The lobulation of the kidney is perceptible for some time after birth. stated, is formed by a dilatation of the lower At the end of the second month this forms a spindle-shaped cavity, the bladder, which communicates with the lower part of the primitive intestine by a short canal, the first part of the urethra. The upper part of the stalk of the allantois, which is not dilated, forms the urachus ; this extends up into the umbilical cord, and at an early period of embryonic existence forms a tube of communication with the allantois. It is obliterated before the termination of foetal life, but the cord formed by its obliteration is perceptible throughout life, passing from the upper part of the bladder to the um- bilicus, and it occasionally remains patent in the adult, constituting a well-known malformation. The su^jrarenal bodies are developed from tw^o different sources. The medul- lary part of the organ is of epiblastic origin, and is derived from the tissues forming the sympathetic ganglia of the abdomen, while the cortical portion is of mesoblastic origin, and originates in the mesoblast just above the kidneys. The two parts are at first quite distinct, but become combined in the process of development. The suprarenal capsules are at first larger than the kidney, but become equal in size about the tenth w^eek, and from that time decrease rela- tively to the kidney, though they remain, throughout foetal life, much larger in pro- portion than in the adult. Development of the Generative Organs. —The first appearance of the reproductive organs is essentially the same in the two at one spot of the epithelial layer which lines the peritoneal or body cavity, with a slight increase of the connective tissue beneath it, forming a low ridge. This is termed the genital ridge, and is situated on the mesial side of each Wolffian body, and from it the testicle in the one sex, and the ovary in the other, are developed. The ridge, as the embryo grows, gradually becomes pinched oft' from the Wolffian body, with which it is at first 3. JJvetev. 4, Urinary bladder, 5. Urachus. of.

About the seventh week the distinction of sex begins to be perceptible. The epithelium on the genital ridge, which is called ' germ-epithelium,' in the female becomes distinctly columnar, multiplies rapidly, and begins to form iwimitive ova, in a manner presently to be described; whereas in the male, though the germ-epithelium has a tendency to become columnar, the cells are, on the whole, flatter and smaller than in the female. Development of Male Organs.—The tubuli seminiferi of the testicle appear it an early period. It is believed that they are formed by the extension of epithelial 3ells on the surface of the genital ridge, into its blastema ; rows of cells are thus developed which become the lining cells of the seminal ducts. In some animals 'e.g. reptiles) the segmental tubes of the Wolffian body have been found to extend nto the body of the testis, and to form the tubes of this organ, which become ined with cells derived from the germ-epithelium, and it is probable that a similar brocess takes place in birds and mammals. The Miillerian ducts disappear in the male sex, with the exception of their ower ends. These unite in the middle line, and open by a common orifice into ihe urogenital sinus. This constitutes the utriculus hofuinis or sinus prostaticus. bccasionally, however, the upper end of the duct of Miiller remains visible in the pale, constituting the little pedunculated body, called the hydatid of Morgagni, [lometimes found in the neighbourhood of the epididymis,* between the testes and pobus major. \ The head of the epididymis, its canal, the vas deferens and ejaculatory duct, ire formed from the canals and duct of the Wolffian body. One or more of the lubes of the Wolffian body form the vas aberrans and a structure described by jiraldes, and called, after him, 'the organ of Giraldes,' which bears a good deal )f resemblance to the organ of Rosenmiiller. in the other sex. It consists of a lumber of convoluted tubules, lying in the cellular tissue in front of the cord, and ilose to the head of the epididymis. j The descent of the testis and the formation of the gubernaculum are described n the body of the work. Development of Female Organs.—The ovary, as above stated, is formed from ihe genital ridge, which becomes pinched off from the remains of the Wolffian |)ody, but is still attached by a mesovarium. It consists of a central part of con- lective tissue covered by a layer of germ-epithelium, from which the ova are developed. This epithelium undergoes repeated division, so that it rapidly increases u thickness and forms several layers. Next certain of the cells become enlarged -nd spherical, and form what are called the prwiitive ova. Around these, other pithelial cells have a tendency to arrange themselves, so as to enclose the ovum a a follicle. The permanent ova, enclosed in their Graafian follicles, are thus ormed. The Fallopian tube is developed from that portion of the duct of Miiller /hich lies above the lumbar ligament of the AVolffian body. This duct is at irst completely closed at its upper extremity, and its closed extremity remains 'Brmanent, forming a small cystic body attached to the fimbriated end of the 'allopian tube, and called the ' hydatid of Morgagni.' Below this a cleft forms a the duct, and is developed into the fimbriated opening of the Fallopian tube. BeloAv this the duct of Miiller and the ducts of the Wolffian bodies are united jogether in a structure called ' the genital cord,' in which the two Miillerian ducts Ipproach each other, lying side by side, and finally coalesce to form the cavity of tie vagina and uterus. This coalescence commences in the middle of the genital ord, and corresponds to the body of the uterus. The upper parts of the Miillerian jucts in the genital cord constitute the cornua of the uterus, little developed in the Mr. Osborn, in the St. Thomas's Hospital Eeports, 1875, has written an interesting aper pointing out the probable connection between this foetal structure and one form of ydrocele.GENEEAL ANATOMY io8 human species. The only remains of the Wolffian body in the complete condition of the female organs are two rudimentary or vestigial structures, which can be found, on careful search, in the broad ligament near the ovary ; the parovarium or organ of BosenmuUer and the epoophoron (fig. io6). The organ of Eosenmiiller consists of a number of tubes which converge to a transverse portion, the epoophoron, and this is sometimes Fig. io6.—Adult ovary, parovarium, and Fallopian tube. prolonged into a distinct (From Farre, after Kobelt.)

AllGENEEAL ANATOMY no these parts are well developed by the second month, yet no distinction of sex is \ possible. I Female Organs (fig. io8, a, b, c).—The female organs are developed by an easy | transition from the above. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the I vagina, and forms a single tube with the upper part of the vagina, which, as we i have already seen, is developed from the united Miillerian ducts. The genital I tubercle forms the clitoris, the genital folds the labia majora, and the lips of the ' genital furrow the labia minora, which remain open. j Male Organs (fig. io8, a', b', c').—In the male the changes are greater. The ' genital tubercle is developed into the penis, the glans appearing in the third month, i the prepuce and corpora cavernosa in the fourth. The genital furrow closes and i thus forms a canal, the spongy portion of the urethra. The urogenital sinus! becomes elongated and forms the prostatic and membranous urethra. The genital' folds unite in the middle line to form the scrotum, at about the same time as the { genital furrow closes—viz. between the third and fourth month. | The following table is translated from the work of Beaunis and Bouchard, with i some alterations, especially in the earlier weeks. It will serve to present a resume; of the above facts in an easily accessible form.* * It will be noticed that the time assigned in this table for the appearance of the first rudiment of some of the bones varies in some cases from that assigned in the description of the various bones in the sequel. This is a point on which anatomists differ, and whichj probably varies in different cases. \CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FCETUS (From Beaunis and Bouchard) First Week.—During this period the ovmn is in the Fallopian tube. Having been fertilised in the upper part of the tube, it slowly passes down, undergoing segmenta- tion, and reaches the uterus probably about the 3nd of the first week. During this time it does not undergo much increase in size. Second Week.—The ovum rapidly increases in size and becomes embedded in the decidua, so that it is completely enclosed in the decidua reflexa by the end of this period. An ovum believed to be of the thirteenth day after conception is described by Reichert. There was no appearance of any embryonic structure. The equatorial margins of the ovum were beset with villi, but the surface in contact with the uterine wall and the one opposite to it were bare. In another ovum, described by His, believed to be of about the fourteenth day, there was a distinct indication of an embryo. There was a medullary groove bounded by folds. In front of this a slightly prominent ridge, the rudimentary heart. The amnion was formed and the emioryo was attached by a stalk, the allantois, to the inner surface of the chorion. It may be said, therefore, that these parts, the amnion and the allantois, and the first rudiments of the embryo, the medullary groove and the heart, are formed at the end of the second week. Third Week.—By the end of the third week the flexures of the embryo have taken place, so that it is strongly curved. The protovertebral discs, which begin to be formed early in the third week, present their full complement. In the nervous system the primary divisions of the brain are visible, and the primitive ocular and auditory vesicles are already formed. The primary circulation is established. The alimentary canal presents a straight tube communicating with the yolk-sac. The pharyngeal ; arches are formed. The limbs have appeared as short buds. The Wolffian bodies 1 are visible. Fourth Week.—The umbilical vesicle has attained its full development. The caudal j extremity projects. The upper and the lower limbs and the cloacal aperture appear. I The heart separates into a right and left heart. The special ganglia and anterior I roots of the spinal nerves, the olfactory fossse, the lungs and the pancreas can be t made out. Fifth Week.—The allantois is vascular in its whole extent. The first traces of the hands j and feet can be seen. The primitive aorta divides into aorta and pulmonary artery. The duct of Miiller and genital gland are visible. The ossification of the clavicle and the lower jaw commences. The cartilage of Meckel occupies the first post-oral 1 arch. Sixth Week.—The activity of the umbilical vesicle ceases. The pharyngeal clefts disappear. The vertebral column, primitive cranium, and ribs assume the cartilaginous condition. The posterior roots of the nerves, the membranes of the nervous centres, the bladder, kidney, tongue, larynx, thyroid body, the germs of teeth, and the genital tubercle and folds are apparent. seventh Week.—The muscles begin to be perceptible. The points of ossification of the ribs, scapula, shaft of humerus, femur, tibia, palate, and upper jaw appear. ^ighth Week.—The distinction of arm and forearm, and of thigh and leg, is apparent, as well as the interdigital clefts. The capsule of the lens and pupillary membrane, the interventricular and commencement of the interauricular septum, the salivary glands, the spleen and suprarenal capsules are distinguishable. The larynx begins to become cartilaginous. All the vertebral bodies are cartilaginous. The points of ossificationGENERAL ANATOMY 112 for the ulna, radius, fibula, and ilium make their appearance. The two halves of the hard palate unite. The sympathetic nerves are now for the first time to be discerned. Ninth Week.—The corpus striatum and the pericardium are first apparent. The ovary and testicle can be distinguished fi'om each other. The genital furrow appears. The osseous nuclei of the bodies and arches of the vertebrae, of the frontal, vomer, and malar bones, of the shafts of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones, and of the phalanges appear. The union of the hard palate is completed. The gall-bladder is seen. Third Month.—The formation of the fwtal placenta advances rapidly. The projection of the caudal extremity disappears. It is possible to distinguish the male and female organs from each other. The cloacal aperture is divided into two parts. The cartilaginous arches on the dorsal region of the spine close. The points of ossification for the occipital, sphenoid, lachrymal, nasal, scpianious portion of temporal and ischium appear, as well as the orbital centre of the superior maxillary. The pons Varolii and fissiu-e of Sylvius can be made out. The eyelids, the hair, and the nails begin to form. The mammary gland, the epiglottis, and prostate are beginning to develop. The union of the testicle with the canals of the Wolftian body takes place. Fourth Month.—The closure of the cartilaginous arches of the spine is complete. Osseous points for the first sacral vertebra and os pubis appear. The ossification of the malleus and incus takes place. The corpus callosum, the membrana lamina spiralis, the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and the tympanic ring are seen. Fat is first developed in the subcutaneous cellular tissue. The tonsils are seen, and the closure of the genital furrow and the formation of the scrotum and prepuce take place. Fifth Month.—The two layers of the decidua begin to coalesce. Osseous nuclei of the axis and odontoid process, of the lateral points of the first sacral vertebra, of the median points of the second, and of the lateral masses of the ethmoid make their appearance. Ossification of the stapes and the petrous bone, and ossification of the germs of the teeth take place. The germs of the permanent teeth and the organ of Corti appear. The eruption of hair on the head commences. The sudoriferous glands, Brunner's glands, the follicles of the tonsil and base of the tongue, and the Ij-mphatic glands appear at this period. The differentiation between the uterus and vagina becomes apparent. Sixth Month.—The points of ossification for the anterior root of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, the lateral points of the second sacral vertebra, the median points of the third, the manubrium sterni and the os calcis appear. The sacro-vertebral angle forms. The cerebral hemispheres cover the cerebellum. The papillae of the skin, the sebaceous glands, and Peyer's patches make their appearance. The free border of the nail projects from the corium of the dermis. The walls of the uterus thicken. Seventh Month.—The additional points of the first sacral vertebra, the lateral points of th'e third, the median point of the fourth, the first osseous point of the body of the sternum, and the osseous point for the astragalus appear. Meckel's cartilage dis- appears. The cerebral convolutions, the island of Keil, and the tubercula quadri- gemina are apparent. The pupillar^^ membrane atrophies. The testicle passes into the vaginal process of the peritoneum. Eighth Month.—Additional points for the second sacral vertebra, lateral points for the fom'th and median points for the fifth sacral vertebrae, can be seen. Ninth Month.—Additional points for the third sacral vertebra, lateral points for the fifth, osseous points for the middle turbinated bone, for the body and great cornu of the hyoid, for the second and third pieces of the body of the sternum, and for the lower end of the femur appear. Ossification of the bony lamina spiralis and axis of the cochlea takes place. The eyelids open, and the testicles are in the scrotum.DESCEIPTIVE AND SURGICAL ANATOMY THE SKELETON rjpHE entire skeleton in the adult consists of 200 distinct bones. These are— The Spine or vertebral column (sacrum and coccyx included) . 26 Cranium 8 Face 14 Os hyoides, sternum, and ribs 26 Upper extremities 64 Lower extremities 62 200 In this enumeration the patellte are included as separate bones, but the smaller sesamoid bones, and the ossicula auditus, are not reckoned. The teeth belong to the tegumentary system. These bones are divisible into four classes : Long, Short, Flat, and Irregular. The Long^ Bones are found in the limbs, where they form a system of levers, which have to sustain the weight of the trunk, and to confer the power of locomo- tion. A long bone consists of a shaft and two extremities. The shaft is a hollow cyHnder, contracted and narrowed to afford greater space for the bellies of the muscles ; the walls consist of dense, compact tissue of great thickness in the middle, but becoming thinner towards the extremities ; the spongy tissue is scanty, and the bone is hollowed out in its interior to form the medullary canal. The extremities are generally somewhat expanded, for greater convenience of mutual connection, for the purposes of articulation, and to afford a broad surface for muscular attachment. Here the bone is made up of spongy tissue with only a thin coating of compact substance. The long bones are not straight, but curved ; the curve generally taking place in two directions, thus affording greater strength to the bone. The bones belonging to this class are : the clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpal and metatarsal bones, and the phalanges. Short Bones.—Where a part of the skeleton is intended for strength and com- pactness, and its motion is at the same time slight and limited, it is divided into a number of small pieces united together by ligaments, and the separate bones are short and compressed, such as the bones of the carpus and tarsus. These bones, in their structure, are spongy throughout, excepting at their surface, where there is a thin crust of compact substance. The patellce also, together with the other sesamoid bones, are by some regarded as short bones. Flat Bones.—Where the principal requirement is either extensive protection or the pro\ision of broad surfaces for muscular attachment, we find the osseous structure expanded into broad, flat plates, as is seen in the bones of the skull and the shoulder-blade. These bones are com^oosed of two thin layers of compact tissue enclosing between them a variable quantity of cancellous tissue. In the cranial bones, these layers of compact tissue are familiarly known as the tables of the ITHE SKELETON 114 skull; the outer one is thick and tough ; the inner one thinner, denser, and more brittle, and hence termed the vitreous table. The intervening cancellous tissue is called the diploe. The flat bones are : the occipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, scapula, os innominatum, sternum, ribs, and patella. The Irregular or Mixed Bones are such as, from their peculiar form, cannot be grouped under either of the preceding heads. Their structure is similar to that of other bones, consisting of a layer of compact tissue externally, and of spongy cancellous tissue within. The irregular bones are : the vertebrce, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, mcdar, superior maxillary, inferior maxillary, palate, inferior turbinated, and hyoid. Surfaces of Bones.—If the surface of any bone is examined, certain eminences and depressions are seen, to which descriptive anatomists have given the following names. These eminences and depressions are of two kinds : articular and non-arti- cular. Well-marked examples of articular eminences are found in the heads of the humerus and femur; and of articular depressions, in the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and the acetabulum. Non-articular eminences are designated according to their form. Thus, a broad, rough, uneven elevation is called a tuberosity ; a small, rough prominence, a tubercle ; a sharp, slender, pointed eminence, a spine ; a narrow, rough elevation, running some way along the surface, a ridge or line. The non-articular depressions are also of very variable form, and are described as fossce, grooves, furrows, fissures, notches, etc. These non-articular eminences and depressions serve to increase the extent of surface for the attachment of liga- ments and muscles, and are usually well-marked in proportion to the muscularity of the subject. A prominent process projecting from the surface of a bone, which it has never been separate from or movable upon, is termed an apophysis (from d7r6<f)V(rL<;, an excrescence) ; but if such process is developed as a separate piece from the rest of the bone, to which it is afterwards joined, it is termed an epiphysis (from eTrtc^ucrt?, an accretion). THE SPINE The Spine is a flexuous and flexible column, formed of a series of bones called vertebrce (from vertere, to turn). The Vertebrae are thirty-three in number, exclusive of those which form the skull, and have received the names cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacred, and coccygeal, according to the position which they occupy; seven being found in the cervical region, twelve in the dorsal, five in the lumbar, five in the sacral, and four in the coccygeal. This number is sometimes increased by an additional vertebra in one region, or the number may be diminished in one region, the deficiency being supplied by an additional vertebra in another. These observations do not apply to the cervical portion of the spine, the number of bones forming which is seldom increased or diminished. The Vertebrae in the upper three regions of the spine are separate throughout the whole of life; but those found in the sacral and coccygeal regions are in the adult firmly united, so as to form two bones—five entering into the formation of the upper bone or sacrum, and four into the terminal bone of the spine or coccyx. General Characters of a Vertebra Each vertebra consists of two essential parts—an anterior solid segment or body, and a posterior segment or arch. The arch is formed of two pedicles, and two lamince, supporting seven processes—viz. four artimdar, two transverse, and one spinous. The bodies of the vertebrae are piled one upon the other, forming a strong pillar, for the support of the cranium and trunk; the arches forming a hollowLIP GEE VIC AL VEKTEBE.E NT-i^^-^ "5 'Y cylinder behind the bodies for the protection of the spinal cord. The different vertebrae are connected together by means of the articular processes and the inter- vertebral cartilages ; while the transverse and spinous processes serve as levers for the attachment of muscles which move the different parts of the spine. Lastly, between each pair of vertebrae apertures exist through which the spinal nerves pass from the cord. Each of these constituent parts must now be separately examined. The Body or centrum is the largest and most solid part of a vertebra. Above and below, it is flattened ; its upper and lower surfaces are rough, for the attachment of the intervertebral fibro-cartilages, and present a rim around their circumference. In front, it is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards. Behind, it is flat from above downwards and slightly concave from side to side. Its anterior surface is perforated by a few small apertures, for the passage of nutrient vessels ; whilst on the posterior surface is a single large, irregular aperture, or occasionally more than one, for the exit of veins from the body of the vertebra—the vencB basis vertehrm. The Pedicles project backwards, one on each side, from the upper part of the body of the vertebra, at the line of junction of its posterior and lateral surfaces. The concavities above and below the pedicles are the intervertebral notches ; they are four in number, two on each side, the inferior ones being generally the deeper. When the vertebrae are articulated, the notches of each contiguous pair of bones form the intervertebral foramina, which communicate with the spinal canal and transmit the spinal nerves and blood-vessels. The Laminae are two broad plates of bone which complete the vertebral arch behind, enclosing a foramen, the spijial foramen, which serves for the protection of the spinal cord ; they are connected to the body by means of the pedicles. Their upper and lower borders are rough, for the attachment of the ligamenta siibflava. The Spinous Process projects backwards from the junction of the two laminae, and serves for the attachment of muscles. The Articular Processes, four in number, two on each side, spring from the junction of the pedicles with the laminae. The two superior project upwards, their articular surfaces being directed more or less backwards ; the two inferior project downwards, their articular surfaces looking more or less forwards.* The Transverse Processes, two in number, project one at each side from the point where the articular processes join the pedicle. They also serve for the attachment of muscles. Character of the Cervical Vertebra (fig. 109) The Cervical Vertebrae are smaller than those in any other region of the spine, and may readily be distinguished by the foramen in the transverse process, which does not exist in the transverse process of either the dorsal or lumbar vertebras. The Body is small, comparatively dense, and broader from side to side than from before backwards. The anterior and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth ; the former is placed on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downwards, so as to overlap the upper and fore part of the vertebra below. Its upper surface is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on each side: its lower surface is convex from side to side, concave from before backwards, and presents laterally a shallow concavity, which receives the corre- sponding projecting lip of the adjacent vertebra. The pedicles are directed obliquely outwards, and the superior intervertebral notches are deeper, but narrower, than the inferior. The lamince are narrow, long, thinner above than below, and overlap each other, enclosing the spinal foramen, which is very large, and of a triangular form. The spinous processes are short, and bifid at the extremity to afford greater extent of surface for the attachment of muscles, the * It may, perhaps, be as well to remind the reader that the direction of a sm^face is determined by that of a line drawn at right angles to it. I 2ii6 THE SKELETON two divisions being often of unequal size. They increase in length from the fourth to the seventh. The articular i^rocesses are oblique: the superior are of an oval form, flattened, and directed backwards and upwards ; the inferior forwards and downwards. The transverse processes are short, directed downwards, outwards. Fict. 109.—Cervical vertebra. Anterior tubercle of trans- verse process Foramen for vertebral artery Posterior tubercle of— transverse process Transverse process Superior articular jjrocess I)iferior articu larj^rocess and forwards, bifid at their extremity, and marked by a groove along their upper surface, which runs downwards and outwards from the superior intervertebral notch, and serves for the transmission of one of the cervical nerves. They are situated in front of the articular processes and on the outer side of the pedicles. The transverse processes are pierced at their base by a foramen, for the trans- mission of the vertebral artery, vein, and plexus of nerves. Each process is formed by two roots : the anterior root, sometimes called the costal process, arises from the side of the body, and is the homologue of the rib in the dorsal region of the spine ; the posterior root springs from the junction of the pedicle with the lamina, Fig. no.—First cervical vertebra, or Atlas. and corresponds with the transverse process in the dorsal region. It is by the junction of the two that the foramen for the vertebral vessels is formed. The extremity of each of these roots forms the anterior and posterior tubercles of the transverse processes.* The peculiar vertebrse in the cervical region are the first, or Atlas ; the second, or Axis ; and the seventh, or Vertebra prominens. The great modifxcations in the The anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra is of large size, and is sometimes known as ' Chassaignac's ' or the ' carotid tubercle.' It is in close relation with the carotid artery, which lies in front and a little external to it; so that, as was first pointed out by Chassaignac, the vessel can with ease be compressed against it.117 CERVICAL VERTEBRA form of the atlas and axis are designed to admit of the nodding and rotatory movements of the head. The Atlas (fig. no) is so named from supporting the globe of the head. The chief peculiarities of this bone are that it has neither body nor spinous process. The body is detached from the rest of the bone, and forms the odontoid process of the second vertebra ; while the parts corresponding to the pedicles join in front to form the anterior arch. The atlas consists of an anterior arch, a posterior arch, and two lateral masses. The anterior arch forms about one-fifth of the bone : its anterior surface is convex, and presents about its centre a tubercle, for the attachment of the Longus colli muscle; posteriorly it is concave, and marked by a smooth, oval or circular facet, for articulation with the odontoid process of the axis. The upper and lower borders give attachment to the anterior occipito-atlantal and the anterior atlanto-axial ligaments which connect it with the occipital bone above and the axis below. The posterior arch forms about two-fifths of the circumference of the bone; it terminates behind in a titbercle, which is the rudiment of a spinous process, and gives origin to the Rectus capitis posticus minor. The diminutive size of this process prevents any interference in the movements between it and the cranium. The posterior part of the arch presents above and behind a rounded edge for the attachment of the posterior occipito- atlantal ligament, whilst in front, immediately behind each superior articular pro- cess, is a groove, sometimes converted into a foramen by a delicate bony spiculum which arches backwards from the posterior extremity of the superior articular process. These grooves represent the superior intervertebral notches, and are peculiar from being situated behind the articular processes, instead of in front of them, as in the other vertebrae. They serve for the transmission of the vertebral artery, which, ascending through the foramen in the transverse process, winds round the lateral mass in a direction backwards and inwards. They also transmit the suboccipital nerve. On the under surface of the posterior arch, in the same situation, are two other grooves, placed behind the lateral masses, and representing the inferior intervertebral notches of other vertebrae. They are much less marked than the superior. The lower border also gives attachment to the posterior atlanto- axial ligament, which connects it with the axis. The lateral masses are the most bulky and solid parts of the atlas, in order to support the weight of the head ; they present two articulating processes above, and two below. The two superior are of large size, oval, concave, and approach each other in front, but diverge behind; they are directed upwards, inwards, and a little backwards, forming a kind of cup for the condyles of the occipital bone, and are admirably adapted to the nodding movements of the head. Not unfrequently they are partially subdivided by a more or less deep indentation which encroaches upon each lateral margin. The inferior articular processes are circular in form, flattened or slightly concave, and directed downwards and inwards, articulating with the axis, and permitting the rotatory movements. Just belo^\r the inner margin of each superior articular surface is a small tubercle, for the attachment of the transverse ligament which, stretching across the ring of the atlas, divides it into two unequal parts ; the anterior or smaller segment receiving the odontoid process of the axis, the posterior allowing the transmission of the spinal cord and its membranes. This part of the spinal canal is of considerable size, to afford space for the spinal cord ; and hence lateral displacement of the atlas may occur without compression of this structure. The transverse processes are of large size, project directly outwards from the lateral masses, and serve for the attachment of special muscles which assist in rotating the head. They are long, not bifid, and perforated at their base by a canal for the vertebral artery, which is directed from below, upwards and backwards. The Axis (fig. in) is so named from forming the pivot upon which the first vertebra, carrying the head, rotates. The most distinctive character of this bone is the strong, prominent process, tooth-like in form (hence the name odontoid), which rises perpendicularly from the upper surface of the body. The body is of aTHE SKELETON ii8 triangular form, deeper in front than behind, and prolonged downwards anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and fore part of the adjacent vertebra. It presents in front a median longitudinal ridge, separating two lateral depressions for the attach- ment of the Longus colli muscle of either side. The odontoid process presents two articulating surfaces : one in front, of an oval form, for articulation with the atlas ; another behind, for the transverse ligament—the latter frequently encroach- FiG. III..—Second cervical vertebra, or Axis. Odontoid process Inferior articular process ing on the sides of the process. The apex is pointed, and gives attachment to one fasciculus of the odontoid ligament {ligamentum sus2:)ensorium). Below the apex the process is somewhat enlarged, and presents on either side a rough impression for the attachment of the lateral fasciculi of the odontoid or check ligaments, which connect-it to the occipital bone ; the base of the process, where it is attached to the body, is constricted, so as to prevent displacement from the transverse ligament, which binds it in this —Seventh cervical vertebra, or vertebra prominens. Bodi/. Fig. 112. situation to the anterior arch of the atlas. Sometimes, however, this process does become dis- placed, especially in children, in whom the ligaments are more relaxed: instant death is the result of this accident. The ])edicles are broad and strong, especially their anterior extrem- ities, which coalesce with the sides of the body and the root of the odontoid process. The lamincz are thick and strong, and the spinal foramen large, but smaller than that of the atlas. The trans- verse pi'^^ocesses are very small, not bifid, and perforated by the vertebral foramen, or foramen for the vertebral artery, which is directed obliquely upwards and outwards. The superior articu- lar siirfaces are round, slightly convex, directed upwards and outwards, and are peculiar in being supported on the body, pedicles, and transverse processes. The inferior articular surfaces have the same direction as those of the other cervical vertebrae. The superior intervertebral notches are very shallow, and lie behind the articular processes; the inferior in front of them, as in the other cervical Spinous process119 DOESAL VERTEBRA vertebrae. The spinous process is of large size, very strong, deeply channelled on its under surface, and presents a bifid, tubercular extremity for the attachment of muscles which serve to rotate the head upon the spine. Seventh Cervical (fig. 112).—The most distinctive character of this vertebra is the existence of a very long and prominent spinous process ; hence the name ' vertebra prominens.' This process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, and has attached to it the ligamentum nuch^. The transverse process is usually of large size, especially its posterior root; its upper surface has usually a shallow groove, and it seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation at its extremity. The vertebral foramen is sometimes as large as in the other cervical vertebrae, but is usually smaller on one or both sides, and sometimes wanting. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery ; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides ; but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, and not through the foramen. Chakactees of the Doesal Veetebe^ The Dorsal Vertebrae are intermediate in size between those in the cervical and those in the lumbar region, and increase in size from above downwards, the upper Fig. 113.—A dorsal vertebra. vertebra3 in this segment of the spine being much smaller than those in the lower 'part of the region. The dorsal vertebrae may be at once recognised by the presence on the sides of the body of one or more facets or half-facets for the heads of the [ribs. The bodies of the dorsal vertebrae resemble those in the cervical and lumbar iregions at the respective ends of this portion of the spine; but in the middle I of the dorsal region their form is very characteristic, being heart-shaped, and as broad in the antero-posterior as in the lateral direction. They are thicker behind than in front, flat above and below, convex and prominent in front, deeply concave behind, slightly constricted in front and at the sides, and marked on each side, I near the root of the pedicle, by two demi-facets, one above, the other below.

The spinous in'ocesses are long, triangular in form (bayonet-shaped), directed obliquely downwards, and terminate in a tubercular extremity. They overlap one another from the fifth to the eighth, but are less oblique in direction above and below.

The transverse processes arise from the same parts of the arch as the posterior roots of the transverse processes in the neck, and are situated behind the articular processes and pedicles ; they are thick, strong, and of great length, directed obliquely backwards and outwards, presenting a clubbed extremity, which is tipped on its anterior part by a small,121 LUMBAR VERTEBRA concave surface, for articulation with the tubercle of a rib. Besides the articular facet for the rib, three indistinct tubercles may be seen rising from the transverse processes, one at the upper border, one at the lower border, and one externally. In man, they are comparatively of small size, and serve only for the attachment of muscles. But in some animals they attain considerable magnitude, either for the purpose of more closely connecting the segments of this portion of the spine, or for muscular and ligamentous attachment. The peculiar dorsal vertebrjB are the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelftJi (fig. 114). The First Dorsal Vertebra presents, on each side of the body, a single entire articular facet for the head of the first rib, and a half-facet for the upper half of the second. The upper surface of the body is like that of a cervical vertebra, being broad transversely, concave, and lipped on each side. The articular surfaces are oblique, and the sjjinous process thick, long, and almost horizontal. The Ninth Dorsal has no demi-facet below. In some subjects, however, the ninth has two demi-facets on each side, then the tenth has a demi-facet at the upper part; none below^ The Tenth Dorsal has (except in the cases just mentioned) an entire articular facet on each side above, which is partly placed on the outer surface of the pedicle. It has no demi-facet below. In the Eleventh Dorsal, the body approaches in its form and size to the lumbar. The articular facets for the heads of the ribs, one on each side, are of large size, and placed chiefly on the pedicles, which are thicker and stronger in this and the next vertebra than in any other part of the dorsal region. The s]:)inous process is short, nearly horizontal in direction, and presents a slight tendency to bifurcation at its extremity. The transverse processes are • very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets for the tubercles of the ribs. The Twelfth Dorsal has the same general characters as the eleventh ; but may be distinguished from it by the inferior articular processes being convex and turned outwards, like those of the lumbar vertebras; by the general form of the body, laminas, and spinous process, approaching to that of the lumbar vertebrae ; and by the transverse processes being shorter, and marked by three elevations, the superior, inferior, and external tubercles, which correspond to the mammillary, accessory, and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebras. Traces of similar elevations are usually to be found upon the other dorsal vertebrae (vide ut supra). Chaeactebs of the Lumbar Vertebe^ The Lumbar Vertebrae (fig. 115) are the largest segments of the vertebral column, and can at once be distinguished by the absence of the foramen in the transverse process, the characteristic point of the cervical vertebrae, and by the- absence of any articulating facet on the side of the body, the distinguishing mark of the dorsal vertebrae. The body is large, and has a greater diameter from side to side than from before backw^ards, slightly thicker in front than behind, flattened or slightly concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and at the sides, presenting prominent margins, w^hich afford a broad basis for the support of the superincumbent weight. The pedicles are very strong, directed backwards from the upper part of the bodies ; consequently, the inferior intervertebral notches are of considerable depth. The lamince, are broad, short, and strong ; and the spinal foramen triangular, larger than in the dorsal, smaller than in the cervical, region. The spinous p)rocesses are thick and broad, somewhat quadrilateral, horizontal in direction, thicker below than above, and terminating by a rough, uneven border. The superior articular processes are concave, and look backw^ards and inwards ; the inferior, convex, look forwards and outwards; the former are separated by a much wilder interval than the latter, embracing the low^er articulating processes of the vertebra above. The transverse processes are long, slender, directedTHE SKELETON 122 transversely outwards in the upper three hmibar vertebrae, slanting a little upwards in the lower two. They are situated in front of the articular processes instead of behind them as in the dorsal vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs. Of the three tubercles noticed in connection with the transverse processes of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, the superior ones become connected in this region with the back part of the superior articular processes, and have received the name of mammillary processes ; the inferior are represented by a small process pointing downwards, situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process, and called the accessory processes—these are .the true transverse processes, which are rudimental in this region of the spine ; the external ones are the so-called transverse processes, the homologue of the rib, and hence sometimes called costal processes. Although in man these are comparatively small, in some animals they attain considerable size, and serve to lock the vertebrae more closely together. The Fifth Lumbar vertebra is characterised by having the body much thicker in front than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacro-vertebral articulation ; by the smaller size of its spinous process ; by the wide interval between the inferior articulating processes ; and by the greater size and thickness of its trans- verse processes^ Structure of the Vertebrae.—The structure of a vertebra differs in different parts. The body is composed of light, spongy, cancellous tissue, having a thin Fig. 115.—Lumbar vertebra. coating of compact tissue on its external surface perforated by numerous orifices, some of large size, for the passage of vessels ; its interior is traversed by one or two large canals, for the reception of veins, which converge towards a single large, irregular aperture, or several small apertures, at the posterior part of the body of each bone. The arch and processes projecting from it have, on the contrary, an exceedingly thick covering of compact tissue. Development.—Each vertebra is formed of four primary cartilaginous portions (fig. 116), one for each lamina and its processes, and two for the body. Ossification commences in the laminae about the sixth week of foetal life, in the situation where the transverse processes afterwards project, the ossific granules shooting backwards to the spine, forwards into the pedicles, and outwards into the transverse and articular processes. Ossification in the body commences in the middle of the cartilage about the eighth week by two closely approximated centres, which speedily coalesce to form one central ossific point. According to some authors, ossifica- tion commences in the laminae, only in the upper vertebrae—i.e. in the cervical and upper dorsal. The first ossific points in the lower vertebra? are those which are to form the body, the osseous centres for the laminae appearing at a subsequent period. At birth these three pieces are perfectly separate. During the first year the laminae become united behind by a portion of cartilage in which the spinous process isDEVELOPMENT OF VERTEBRA 123 About the third year the body that the body is formed from Fig. 116.—Development of a vertebra.

Thus the bodies of the sacral vertebrae are formed almost entirely from the central nuclei; the bodies of the lumbar are formed laterally and behind by the pedicles; in the dorsal region, the pedicles advance as far forward as the articular de- pressions for the head of the ribs, forming these cavities of reception ; and in the neck the lateral por- tions of the bodies are formed en- tirely by the advance of the pedi- cles. Before puberty, no other changes occur, excepting a gradual increase in the growth of these primary centres; the upper and under surfaces of the bodies, and the ends of the transverse and spinous processes, being tipped with cartilage, in which ossific granules are not as yet deposited. At six- teen years (fig. 117), four secondary centres appear, one for the tip of each transverse process, and two (sometimes united into one) for the end of the spinous process. At twenty-one years (fig. 118), a thin circular epiphysial plate of bone is formed in the layer of cartilage situ- ated on the upper and under surfaces of the body, the former being the thicker of the two. All these be- come joined, and the bone is com- pletely formed betAveen the twenty- fifth and thirtieth year of life. Exceptions to this mode of de- velopment occur in the first, second, and seventh cervical, and in the vertebrae of the lumbar region. The Atlas (fig. 119).—The number of centres of ossification of the atlas is very variable. It may be developed from two, three, four, or five centres. The most frequent arrangement is by three centres. Two of these are destined for the two lateral or neural masses, the ossification of which commences about the seventh Aveek near the articular processes, and extend backwards ; these portions of bone are separated from one another behind, at birth, by a narrow interval filled in with cartilage.

The anterior arch, at birth, is altogether cartilaginous, and in this a separate nucleus appears about the end of the first year after birth, and extending laterally joins the neural processes in front of the pedicles. Sometimes there are two nuclei deve- loped in the cartilage, one on either side of the median line, which join to form a single mass. And occasionally there is no separate centre, but the anterior arch is formed by the gradual extension forwards and ultimate junction of the two neural processes. The Axis (fig. 120) is developed by six centres. The body and arch of this bone are formed in the same manner as the corresponding parts in the other vertebrae : one centre (or two, Avhich speedily coalesce) for the lower part of the body, and one for each lamina. The odontoid process consists originally of an extension upwards of the cartilaginous mass, in which the lower part of the body is formed. At about the sixth month of foetal life, tw^o osseous nuclei make their appearance in the base of this process: they are placed laterally, and join before birth to form a conical bilobed mass deeply cleft above ; the interval between the cleft and the summit of the process is formed by a wedge-shaped piece of cartilage, the base of the pro- cess being separated from the body by a cartilaginous interval, which gradually becomes ossified at its circumference, but remains cartilaginous in its centre until advanced age.* Finally, as Humphry has demonstrated, the apex of the odontoid process has a separate nucleus, which appears in the second year and joins about the twelfth year. In addition to these there is a secondary centre for a thin epiphysial plate on the under surface of the body of the bone. The Seventh Cervical.—The anterior or costal part of the transverse process of the seventh cervical is developed from a separate osseous centre at about the sixth month of foetal life, and joins the body and posterior division of the trans- verse process between the fifth and sixth years. Sometimes this process continues as a separate piece, and, becoming lengthened outwards, constitutes what is known as a cervical rib. The Lumbar Vertebrae (fig. 121) have two additional centres (besides those peculiar to the vertebrae generally) for the mammillary tubercles, which project from the back part of the superior articular processes. The transverse process of the first lumbar is sometimes developed as a separate piece, which may remain permanently unconnected with the remaining portion of the bone, thus forming a lumbar rib—a peculiarity which is rarely met with. Progress of Ossification in the Spine generally.—Ossification of the lamina? of the vertebrae commences at the upper part of the spine, and proceeds gradually downwards. Ossification of the bodies, on the other hand, commences a little below the centre of the spinal column (about the ninth or tenth dorsal vertebra), and extends both upwards and downwards. Although, however, the ossific nuclei make their first appearance in the lower dorsal vertebrae, the lumbar and first sacral are those in which these nuclei are largest at birth. Attachment of Muscles.—To the Atlas are attached nine pairs: the Longus colli, Eectus capitis anticus minor. Rectus lateralis, Obliquus capitis superior and inferior, Splenius colli. Levator anguli scapulae. First Inter-transverse, and Rectus capitis posticus minor. To the Axis are attached eleven pairs: the Longus colli, Levator anguli scapulae, Splenius colli. Scalenus medius, Transversalis colli, Intertransversales, Obliquus capitis inferior, Rectus capitis posticus major, Semi-spinalis colli, Multifidus spinae, Interspinales. To the remaining vertebrae, generally, are attached thirty-five pairs and a single muscle : anteriorly, the Rectus capitis anticus major, Longus colli, Scalenus anticus, medius, and posticus.

Sackal and Coccygeal Vertebe.^: The Sacral and Coccygeal Vertebrae consist, at an early period of life, of nine separate pieces, which are united in the adult, so as to form two bones, five entering into the formation of the sacrum, four into that of the coccyx. Occasionally, the coccyx consists of five hones.* The Sacrum (sacer, sacred) is a large, triangular bone (fig. 122), situated at the lower part of the vertebral column, and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted like a wedge between the two innominate bones; its upper part, or base, articulating with the last lumbar vertebra, its apex with the coccyx. The sacrum is curved upon itself, and placed very obliquely, its upper extremity projecting forwards, and forming, Avith the last lumbar vertebra, a very prominent angle, called the iwomontory or sacro-vertehral angle ; whilst its central part is directed backwards, so as to give increased capacity to the pelvic cavity. It presents for examination an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral surfaces, a base, an apex, and a central canal. The Anterior Surface is concave from above downwards, and slightly so from side to side. In the middle are seen four transverse ridges, indicating the original * Sir George Humphry describes this as the usual composition of the coccyx.— On the SJteleton, p. 456.THE SKELETON 126 division of the bone into five separate pieces. The portions of bone intervening between the ridges correspond to the bodies of the vertebr?e. The body of the first segment is of large size, and in form resembles that of a lumbar vertebra ; the succeeding ones diminish in size from above downwards, are flattened from before backwards, and curved so as to accommodate themselves to the form of the sacrum, being concave in front, convex behind. At each end of the ridges above mentioned are seen the anterior sacral foramina, Fig. 123.—Vertical section of the sacrum. analogous to the intervertebral foramina, four in number on each side, somewhat rounded in form, diminishing in size from above downwards, and directed outwards and forwards ; they transmit the anterior branches of the sacral nerves. External to these foramina is the lateral mass, consisting, at an early period of life, of separate segments; these become blended, in the adult, with the bodies, with each other, and with the posterior transverse processes. Each lateral mass is traversed by four broad, shallow grooves, which lodge the an- terior sacral nerves as they pass out- wards, the grooves being separated by prominent ridges of bone, which give attachment to the slips of the Pyriformis muscle. If a vertical section is made through the centre of the bone (tig. 123), the bodies are seen to be united at their cir- cumference by bone, a wide interval being left centrally, which, in the recent state, is filled by intervertebral substance. In some bones, this union is more com- plete between the lower segments than between the upper ones. The Posterior Surface (fig. 124) is convex and much narrower than the anterior. In the middle line are three or four tubercles, which represent the rudimentary spinous processes of the sacral vertebra. Of these tubercles, the first is usually prominent, and perfectly distinct from the rest; the second and third are either separate or united into a tubercular ridge, which diminishes in size from above downwards; the fourth usually, and the fifth always, remaining undeveloped. External to the spinous processes on each side are the lamince, broad and well marked in the first three pieces ; some- times the fourth, and generally the fifth, being undeveloped : in this situation the lower end of the sacral canal is exposed, and is liable to be opened in the sloughing of bed-sores. External to the lamina is a linear series of indistinct tubercles representing the articular processes ; the upper pair are large, well developed, and correspond in shape and direction to the superior articulating processes of a lumbar vertebra ; the second and third are small; the fourth and fifth (usually blended together) are situated on each side of the sacral canal: they are called the sacral comua, and articulate with the cornua of the coccyx. External to the articular processes are the torn posterior sacral foramina ; they are smaller in size and less regular in form than the anterior, and transmit the posterior branches of the sacral nerves. On the outer side of the posterior sacral foramina is a series of tubercles, the rudimentary transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae. The ^first pair of transverse tubercles are of large size, very distinct, and correspond with each127 SACEUM superior angle of the bone ; the second, small in size, enter into the formation of the sacro-iliac articulation ; the third give attachment to the oblique fasciculi of the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments ; and the fourth and fifth to the great sacro-sciatic ligaments. The interspace between the spinous and transverse processes on the back of the sacrum presents a wide, shallow concavity, called the sacral groove ; it is continuous above with the vertebral groove, and lodges the origin of the Erector spin^e. The Lateral Surface, broad above, becomes narrowed into a thin edge below. Its upper half presents in front a broad, ear-shaped surface for articulation with the ilium. This is called the auricular surface, and in the fresh state is coated with fibro-cartilage. It is bounded posteriorly by deep and uneven impressions, for the attachment of the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments. The lower half is thin and sharp, and gives attachment to the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments, Fig. 124.—Sacrum, posterior surface. and to some fibres of the Gluteus maximus ; below, it presents a deep notch, which is converted into a foramen by articulation with the transverse process of the upper piece of the coccyx, and transmits the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. The Base of the sacrum, which is broad and expanded, is directed upwards and forwards. In the middle is seen a large oval articular surface, which is connected the under surface of the body of the last lumbar vertebra by a fibro-carti- laginous disc. It is bounded behind by the large, triangular orifice of the sacral canal. The orifice is formed behind by the laminae and spinous process of the first sacral vertebra : the superior articular processes project from it on each side ; they are oval, concave, directed backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra ; and in front of each articular process is an inter- vertebral notch, which forms the lower half of the last intervertebral foramen.128 THE SKELETON Lastly, on each side of the large oval articular surface is a broad and flat triangular surface of bone, which extends outwards, supports the Psoas magnus muscle and lumbo-sacral cord, and is continuous on each side with the iliac fossa. This is called the ala of the sacrum, and gives attachment to a few of the fibres of the Iliacus muscle. The Apex, directed downwards and forwards, presents a small, oval, concave surface for articulation with the coccyx. The Spinal Canal runs throughout the greater part of the bone ; it is large and triangular in form above, small and flattened, from before backwards, below. In this situation its posterior wall is incomplete, from the non-development of the laminae and spinous processes. It lodges the sacral nerves, and is perforated by the anterior and posterior sacral foramina, through which these pass out. Structure.—It consists of much loose, spongy tissue within, invested externally by a thin layer of compact tissue. Differences in the Sacrum of the Male and Female.—The sacrum in the female is usually wider than in the male ; the lower half forms a greater angle with the upper; the upper half of the bone being nearly straight, the lower half pre- senting the greatest amount of curvature. The bone is also directed more obliquely backwards, which increases the size of the pelvic cavity ; but the sacro-vertebral angle projects less. In the male the curvature is more evenly distributed over the whole length of the bone, and is altogether greater than in the female. Peculiarities of the Sacrum.—This bone, in some cases, consists of six pieces ; occasionally, the number is reduced to four. Sometimes the bodies of the first and second segments are not joined, or the laminaB and spinous processes have not coalesced. Occasionally, the upper pair of transverse tubercles are not joined to the rest of the bone on one or both sides; and, lastly, the sacral canal may be open for nearly the lower half of the bone, in consequence of the imperfect development of the laminae and spinous processes. The sacrum, also, varies con- siderably with respect to its degree of curvature. From the examination of a large number of skeletons, it would appear that, in one set of cases, the anterior surface of this bone was nearly straight, the cmwature, which was very slight, affecting only its lower end. In another set of cases, the bone was curved throughout its whole length, but especially towards its middle. In a third set, the degree of curvature was less marked, and affected especially the loAver third of the bone. Development (fig. 125).—The sacrum, formed by the union of five vertebrae, has thirty-five centres of ossification. The bodies of the sacral vertebrae have each three ossific centres : one for the central part, and one for the epiphysial plates on its upper and under surface. Occasionally the primary centres for the bodies of the first and second piece of the sacrum are double. The arch of each sacral vertebra is developed by two centres, one for each lamina. These unite with each other behind, and subsequently join the body. The lateral masses have six additional centres, two for each of the first three vertebrae. These centres make their appearance above and to the outer side of the anterior sacral foramina (fig. 125), and are developed into separate segments (fig. 126) ; they are subsequently blended with each other, and with the bodies and transverse processes, to form the lateral mass. Lastly, each lateral surface of the sacrum is developed by two epiphysial plates (fig. 127) : one for the auricular surface, and one for the remaining part of the thin lateral edge of the bone. Period of Development.—At about the eighth or ninth week of foetal life, ossi- fication of the central part of the bodies of the first three vertebrje commences; and, at a somewhat later period, that of the last two. Between the sixth and eighth months ossification of the laminae takes place ; and at about the same period, the characteristic osseous tubercles for the first three sacral vertebrae make their appearance. The period at which the arch becomes completed by the junction of the laminae with the bodies in front, and with each other behind, varies in different129 COCCYX Fig. 125.—Development of the sacrum. Additional centres for tJie first three pieces* At birth segments. The junction between the laminae and the bodies takes place first in the lower vertebrae as early as the second year, but is not effected in the upper- most until the fifth or sixth year. About the sixteenth year the epiphyses for the upper and under surfaces of the bodies are formed; and between the eighteenth and twentieth years, those for each lateral surface of the sacrum make their appear- ance. The bodies of the sacral vertebrae are, during early life, separated from each other by intervertebral discs. But about the eighteenth year the two lowest seg- ments become joined together by ossifica- tion extending through the disc. This process gradually extends upwards until all the segments become united ; and the bone is completely formed from the twenty- fifth to the thirtieth year of lif-e. Articulations.—With four bones: the last lumbar vertebra, coccyx, and the two ossa innominata. Attachment of Muscles.— To eight pairs : in front, the Pyriformis and Coccy- geus, and a portion of the Iliacus to the H yrs base of the bone; behind, the Gluteus maximus, Latissimus dorsi, Multifidus spinas, and Erector spinas, and sometimes the Extensor coccygis. Fig. 126. The Coccyx Fig. 127. Two ejjiphysial lamince for each lateral surface * The Coccyx (kokkv^, cuckoo), so called from having been compared to a cuckoo's beak (fig. 128), is usually formed of four small segments of bone, the most rudi- mentary parts of the vertebral column. In each of the first three segments may be traced a rudimentary body, articular and transverse processes; the last piece year (sometimes the third) is a mere nodule of bone, mthout distinct processes. All the segments are destitute of pedicles, laminae, and spinous processes ; and, consequently, of intervertebral foramina and spinal canal. The first segment is the largest; it resembles the lowermost sacral vertebra, and often exists as a separate piece ; the last three, diminishing in size from above downwards, are usually blended together so as to form a single bone. The gradual diminution in the size of the pieces gives this bone a triangular form, the base of the triangle joining the end of the sacrum. It presents for examination an anterior and posterior surface, two borders, a base, and an apex. The anterior surface is slightly concave, and marked with three transverse grooves, indicating the points of junction of the different pieces. It has attached to it the anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament and Levator ani muscle, and supports the lower end of the rectum. The posterior surface is convex, marked by transverse grooves similar to those on the anterior surface ; and presents on each side a lineal row of tubercles, the rudimentary articular processes of the coccygeal vertebra. Of these, the superior pair are large, and are called the cornua of the coccyx : they project upwards, and articulate mth the KTHE SKELETON Fig. 128.—Coccyx. Cornua Anterior surface cornua of the sacrum, the junction between these two bones completmg the fifth posterior sacral foramen for the transmission of the posterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. The lateral horders are thin, and present a series of small eminences, which represent the transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. Of these, the first on each side is the largest, flattened from before back- wards, and often ascends to join the lower part of the thin lateral edge of the sacrum, thus completing the fifth anterior sacral foramen for the trans- mission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve ; the others diminish in size from above downwards, and are often wanting. The horders of the coccyx are narroAV, and give attachment on each side to the sacro-sciatic ligaments, to the Coccygeus muscle in front of the ligaments, and to the Gluteus maximus behind them. The base presents an oval surface for articulation with the sacrum. The a'i)ex is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the external Sphincter muscle. It is occasionally bifid, and sometimes deflected to one or other side. Development.—The coccyx is developed by four centres, one for each piece. Occasionally one of the first three pieces of this bone is developed by two centres, placed side by side. The ossific nuclei make their appearance in the following order : in the first segment, at birth ; in the second piece, at from five to ten years; in the third, from ten to fifteen years ; in the fourth, from fifteen to twenty years. As age advances, these various seg- ments become united in the folloAving order : the first two pieces join; then the third and fourth ; and, lastly, the bone is completed by the union of the second and third. At a late period of life, especially in females, the coccyx often becomes joined to the end of the sacrum. Articulation.—With the sacrum. Attachment of Muscles.—To four pairs and one single muscle : on either side, the Coccygeus ; behind, the Gluteus maximus and Extensor coccygis, when present; at the apex, the Sphincter ani; and in front, the Levator ani. Posterior surface Of the Spine in general The Spinal Column, formed by the junction of the vertebrae, is situated in the median line, at the posterior part of the trunk; its average length is about two feet two or three inches, measuring along the curved anterior surface of the column. Of this length the cervical part measures about five, the dorsal about eleven, the lumbar about seven inches, and the sacrum and coccyx the remainder. The female spine is about one inch less than the male. Viewed in front, it presents two pyramids joined together at their bases, the upper one being formed by all the vertebrae from the second cervical to the last lumbar, the lower one by the sacrum and coccyx. When examined more closely, the upper pyramid is seen to be formed of three smaller pyramids. The upper- most of these consists of the six lower cervical vertebrae ; its apex being formed by the axis or second cervical, its base by the first dorsal. The second pyramid, which is inverted, is formed by the four upper dorsal vertebrae, the base being at the first dorsal, the smaller end at the fourth. The third pyramid commences at the fourth dorsal, and gradually increases in size to the fifth lumbar.THE SPINE IN GENEEAL Viewed laterally (fig. 129), the spinal column presents several curves, which correspond to the different regions of the column, and are called cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and pelvic. The cervical curve commences at the apex of the odontoid process, and terminates at the middle of the second dorsal vertebra ; it is convex in front, and is the least marked of all the curves. The dorsal curve, which is concave forAvards, commences at the middle of the second, and terminates at the middle of the twelfth dorsal. Its most prominent point behind corresponds to the spine of the seventh dorsal vertebra. The lumbar curve commences at the middle of the last dorsal vertebra, and terminates at the sacro-vertebral angle. It is convex anteriorly; the convexity of the lower three vertebrtB being much greater than that of the upper ones. The pelvic curve commences at the sacro-vertebral articu- lation, and terminates at the point of the coccyx. It is concave anteriorly. The dorsal and pelvic curves are the primary curves, and begin to be formed at an early period of foetal life, and are due to the shape of the bodies of the vertebra. The cervical and lumbar curves are compen- satory or secondary, and are developed after birth in order to maintain the erect position. They are due mainly to the shape of the intervertebral discs. The spine has also a slight lateral curvature, the convexity of which is directed towards the right side. This is most probably produced, as Bichat first explained, chiefly by muscular action; most persons using the right arm in preference to the left, especially in making long-continued efforts, when the body is curved to the right side. In support of this explanation, it has been found, by Beclard, that in one or two individuals who were left-handed, the lateral curva- ture was directed to the left side. The spinal column presents for ex- amination an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral surfaces : a base, summit, and spinal canal. The anterior surface presents the bodies of the vertebrae separated in the recent state by the intervertebral discs. The bodies are broad in the cervical region, narrow in the upper part of the dorsal, and broadest in the lumbar region. The whole of this surface is convex Fig. 129.—Lateral view of the spine. K 2THE SKELETON 132 transversely, concave from above downwards in the dorsal region, and convex in the same direction in the cervical and lumbar regions. The posterior surface presents in the median line the spinous processes. These are short, horizontal, with bifid extremities, in the cervical region. In the dorsal region, they are directed obliquely above, assume almost a vertical direction in the middle, and are horizontal below, as are also the spines of the lumbar vertebrae. They are separated by considerable intervals in the loins, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the dorsal region. Occa- sionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line—a fact to be remembered in practice, as irregularities of this sort are attendant also on fractures or displacements of the spine. On either side of the spinous processes, extending the whole length of the column, is the vertebral groove formed by the lamiufe in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the laminae and transverse processes in the dorsal region, where it is deep and broad. In the recent state, these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. External to the vertebral grooves are the articular processes, and still more externally the trans- verse process. In the dorsal region, the latter processes stand backwards, on a plane considerably posterior to the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, and on the outer side of the pedicles, between the intervertebral foramina. In the dorsal region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar, they are placed also in front of the articular processes, but behind the intervertebral foramina. The lateral surfaces are separated from the posterior by the articular processes in the cervical and lumbar regions, and by the transverse processes in the dorsal. These surfaces present in front the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, marked in the dorsal region by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the intervertebral foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the intervertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the dorsal regions, and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They are situated between the transverse processes in the neck, and in front of them in the back and loins, and transmit the spinal nerves. The base of that portion of the vertebral column formed by the twenty-four movable vertebrae is formed by the under surface of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra ; and the summit by the upper surface of the atlas. The vertebral or spinal canal follows the different curves of the spine ; it is largest in those regions in which the spine enjoys the greatest freedom of movement, as in the neck and loins, where it is wide and triangular ; and narrow and rounded in the back, where motion is more limited. Surface Form.—The only part of the vertebral coliuiin which lies closely under the skin, and so direct!}' influences surface form, is the apices of the spinous processes. These are alwaj^s distinguishable at the bottom of a median furrow, which, more or less evident, runs down the mesial line of the back from the external occipital protuberance above to the middle of the sacrum below. In the neck the furrow is broad, and terminates below in a conspicuous projection, which is caused by the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra (vertebra prominens). Above this the spinous process of the sixth cervical vertebra may sometimes be seen; the other cervical spines are sunken, and are not visible, though the spine of the axis can be felt, and generally also the spines of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrte. In the dorsal region the fim'ow is shallow, and during stooping disappears, and then the spinous processes become more or less visible. The markings produced by these spines are small and close together. In the lumbar region the furrow is deep, and the situation of the lumbar spines is frequently indicated by little pits or depressions, especially if the muscles in the loins are well developed and the spine incurved. They are much larger and farther apart than in the dorsal region. In the sacral regioii the furrow is shallower, presenting a flattened area which terminates below at the most prominent part of the posterior surface of the sacrum, formed by the spinous process of the third sacral vertebra. At the bottom of the furrow may be felt the irregular posterior sm-face of the bone. Below this, in the deep groove leading to the anus, the coccyx may be felt. The only other portions of the vertebral column which can be felt fi-om the surface are the transverse processes of three of the cervical vertebne—viz. the first, the sixth, and the seventh. The transverse process of the atlas can be felt as aTHE SPINE IN GENERAL 133 rounded nodule of bone just below and in front of the apex of the mastoid process, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra is of surgical importance. If deep pressure be made in the neck, m the course of the carotid artery, opposite the cricoid cartilage, the prominent anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra can be felt. This has been named Chassaigjiac's tubercle, and against it the carotid artery may be most conveniently com- pressed by the finger. The transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra can also often be felt. Occasionally the anterior root, or costal process, is large and segmented oti', forming a cervical rib. Surgical Anatomy.—Occasionally the coalescence of the laminae is not completed, and consequently a cleft is left in the arches of the vertebrae, through which a protrusion of the spinal membranes (dura mater and arachnoid), and sometimes of the spinal cord itself, takes place, constituting the disease known as spina bifida. This disease is most common in the lumbo-sacral region, on account of the fact, previously stated, that the closure of the arches takes place gradually from above downward; but it may occur in the dorsal or cervical region, or the arches throughout the whole length of the canal may remain unapproximated. In some rare cases, in consequence of the non-coalescence of the two primary centres from which the body is formed, a similar condition may occur in front of the canal, the bodies of the vertebrae being found cleft and the tumour projecting into the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis, between the lateral halves of the bodies affected. The construction of the spinal column of a number of pieces, securely connected together and enjojdng only a slight degree of movement between any two individual pieces, though permitting of a very considerable range of movement as a whole, allows a sufficient degree of mobility without any material diminution of strength. The many joints of which the spine is composed, together with the very varied movements to which it is subjected, render it liable to sprains; but so closely are the individual vertebrae articulated that these sprains are rarely or ever severe, and any amount of violence sufficiently great to produce tearing of the ligaments would tend rather to cause a dislocation or fracture. The further safety of the colmnn and its less liability to injury is provided for by its disposition in curves, instead of in one straight line. For it is an elastic column, and must first bend before it breaks; under these circumstances, being made up of three curves, it represents three columns, and greater force is required to produce bending of a short column, than of a longer one that is equal to it in breadth and material. Again, the safety of the column is provided for by the interposition of the intervertebral disc between the bodies of the vertebrae, which act as admirable buffers in counteracting the effects of violent jars or shocks. Fracture-dislocation of the spine may be caused by direct or indirect violence or by a combination of the two, as when a person, falling from a height, strikes against some prominence and is doubled over it. The fractures from indirect violence are the more common, and here the bodies of the vertebras are compressed, whilst the arches are torn asunder; whilst in fractures from direct violence the arches are compressed and the bodies of the vertebra separated from each other. It will therefore be seen that in both classes of injury the spinal marrow is the part least likely to be injured, and may escape damage even where there has been considerable lesion of the bony framework. For, as Mr. Jacobson states, ' being lodged in the centre of the column, it occupies neutral ground in respect to forces which might cause fracture. For it is a law in mechanics that when a beam, as of timber, is exposed to breakage and the force does not exceed the limits of the strength of the material, one division resists compression, another laceration of the particles, while the third, between the two, is in a negative condition.' * Applying this principle to the spine, it will be seen that, whether the fracture-dislocation be produced by direct violence or indirect, one segment, either the anterior or posterior, will be ex- posed to compression, the other to laceration, and the intermediate part, where the cord is situated, will be in a neutral state. When a fracture-dislocation is produced by indirect violence, the displacement is almost always the same ; the upper segment being driven forwards on the lower, so that the cord is compressed between the body of the vertebra below and the arch of the vertebra above. The parts of the spine most liable to be injured are (i) the dorsi-lumbar region, for this i^art is near the middle of the column and there is therefore a greater amount of leverage, and moreover the portion above is comparatively fixed, and the vertebrae which form it, though much smalle^r, have nevertheless to bear almost as great a weight as those below ; (2) the cervico-dorsal region, because here the flexible cervical portion of the spine joins the more fixed dorsal region ; and (3) the alto-axoid region, because it enjoys an extensive range of movement, and, being near the skull, is influenced by violence applied to the head. In fracture-dislocation it has been proposed to trephine the spine and remove portions of the laminae and spinous processes. The operation can only be of use when the paralysis is due to the pressure of bone or the effusion of blood, and not to cases, which are by far the most common, where the cord is crushed to a pulp. And even in those cases where the cord is compressed by bone, the i)ortion of displaced bone which presses on the cord is generally the body of the vertebra below and is therefore inaccessible to operation. The operative proceeding is one of great severity, involving an extensive * Holmes's System of Surgery, vol. i. p. 529. 1883.134 THE SKELETON and deep wound and great risk of septic meningitis, and as the advantages to be derived from it are exceedingly problematical and confined to a very few cases, it is not often resorted to. Trephining has also been resorted to in some cases of paraplegia, due to Potts's disease of the spine. Here the paralysis is due to the pressure of inflammatory products, and where this is new scar-tissue, formed by the organisation of granulation tissue, its removal has been attended with a very considerable amount of success. THE SKULL The Skull, or superior expansion of the vertebral column, has been described as if composed of four vertebr^e, the elementary parts of which are specially modified in form and size, and almost immovably connected, for the reception of the brain and special organs of the senses. These vertebrae are the occipital, parietal, frontal, and nasal. Descriptive anatomists, however, divide the skull into two parts, the Cranium and the Face. The Cranium (Kpavo?, a helmet) is composed of eight bones—viz. the occijntal, two parietal, f rontal, two temporal, sphenoid, and ethmoid. The Face is composed of fourteen bones—viz. the two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, two malar, two palate, two inferior turbinated, vomer, and inferior maxillary. The ossicula auditus, the teeth, and Wormian bodies are not included in this enumeration. Skull, 2 2 hones. Cranium, 8 bones Face, 14 hones Occipital. Two parietal. Frontal. Two Temporal. Sphenoid. Ethmoid. Two Nasal. Two Superior Maxillary. Two Lachrymal. Two Malar. Two Palate. Two Inferior Turbinated. Vomer. Inferior Maxillary. The Occipital Bone The Occipital Bone (ob, caput, against the head) is situated at the back part and base of the cranium, is trapezoid in form (fig. 130), curved upon itself, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. The external surface is convex. Midway between the summit of the bone and the posterior margin of the foramen magnum is a prominent tubercle, the external occipiital protuberance, for the attachment of the Ligamentum nuchae; and descending from it as far as the foramen, a vertical ridge, the external occipital crest. This tubercle and crest vary in prominence in different skulls. Passing outwards from the occipital protuberance is a semicircular ridge on each side, the superior curved line. Above this line there is often a second less distinctly marked ridge, called the highest curved line {linea suprema), to it the epicranial aponeurosis is attached. The bone between these two lines is smoother and denser than the rest of the surface. Running parallel with these from the middle of the crest is another semicircular ridge on each side, the inferior curved lines. The surface of the bone above the superior curved lines is rough and porous, and, in the recent state, is covered by the Occipito-frontalis muscle, whilst the ridges, as well as the surface of the bone between them, serve for the attachment of numerous muscles. The superior curved line gives attachment internally to the Trapezius, externally to the muscular origin of the Occipito-frontalis, and to. the Sterno-cleido-mastoid, to the extent shown in fig. 130; the depressions between the curved lines to the Complexus internally, the Splenius capitis and Obliquus capitis superior externally. i135 OCCIPITAL BONE The inferior curved line, and the depressions below it, afford insertion to the Rectus capitis posticus, major and minor. The foramen mag-mim is a large, oval aperture, its long diameter extending from before backwards. It transmits the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the spinal accessory nerves, the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and the occipito-axial ligaments. Its back part is wide for the transmission of the medulla, and the corresponding margin rough for the attachment of the dura mater enclosing it; the fore part is narrower, being encroached upon by the condyles ; it has projecting towards it, from below, the odontoid process, and its margins are smooth and bevelled internally to support the medulla oblongata. On each side of the foramen magnum are the condyles, for articulation with the atlas ; they are convex, oblong or reniform in shape, and directed downwards and out- wards ; they converge in front, and encroach slightly upon the anterior segment of Fig. 130.—Occipital bone. Outer surface. the foramen. On the inner border of each condyle is a rough tubercle for the attachment of the ligaments {check) which connect this bone with the odontoid process of the axis; whilst external to them is a rough tubercular prominence, i'hQ transverse ot jugular process (the representative of the transverse process of a vertebra), channelled in front by a deep notch, which forms part of the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum posterius. The under surface of this process presents an eminence, which represents the paramastoicl process of some mammals. The eminence is occasionally large, and extends as low as the transverse process of the atlas. This surface affords attachment to the Rectus capitis lateralis muscle and to the lateral occipito-atlantal ligament; its upper or cerebral surface presents a deep groove which lodges part of the lateral sinus, whilst its external surface is marked by a quadrilateral rough facet, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and articu- lating with a similar surface on the petrous portion of the temporal bone. On the outer side of each condyle, near its fore part, is a foramen, the anterior condyloid;136 THE SKELETON it is directed downwards, outwards, and forwards, and transmits the hypoglossal nerve, and occasionally a meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery. This foramen is sometimes double. Behind each condyle is a fossa,* sometimes perforated at the bottom by a foramen, the posterior condyloid, for the transmis- sion of a vein to the lateral sinus. In front of the foramen magnum is a strong quadrilateral plate of bone, the basilar process, wider behind than in front; its under surface, which is rough, presenting in the median line a tubercular ridge, the pharyngeal spine, for the attachment of the tendinous raphe and Superior constrictor of the pharynx ; and, on each side of it, rough depressions for the attachment of the Kectus capitis anticus, major and minor. The Internal or Cerebral Surface (fig. 131) is deeply concave. The posterior Fig. 131.—Occipital bone. Imier"surface. Superior angle or occipital part is divided by a crucial ridge into four fossae. The two superior fossaB receive the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, and present slight eminences and depressions corresponding to their convolutions. The two inferior, which receive the hemispheres of the cerebellum, are larger than the former, and com- paratively smooth ; both are marked by slight grooves for the lodgment of arteries. At the point of meeting of the four divisions of the crucial ridge is an eminence, the internal occipital protuberance. It nearly corresponds to that on the outer i * This fossa presents many variations in size. It is usually shallow, and the foramen j small; occasionally wanting on one or both sides. Sometimes both fossa and foramen are large, but confined to one side only ; more rarely, the fossa and foramen are very large on both sides.OCCIPITAL BONE 137 surface, and is perforated by one or more large vascular foramina. From this eminence, the superior division of the crucial ridge runs upwards to the superior angle of the bone; it presents a deep groove for the superior longitudinal sinus, the margins of which give attachment to the falx cerebri. The inferior division, the internal occipital crest, runs to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, on the edge of which it becomes gradually lost; this ridge, which is bifurcated below, serves for the attachment of the falx cerebelli. It is usually marked by a single groove, which commences at the back part of the foramen magnum and lodges the occipital sinus. Occasionally the groove is double where two sinuses exist. The transverse grooves pass outwards to the lateral angles ; they are deeply channelled, for the lodgment of the lateral sinuses, their prominent margins affording attachment to the tentorium cerebelli.* At the point of meeting of these grooves is a depression, the torcular HeTophili,^ placed a little to one or the other side of the internal occipital protuberance. More anteriorly is the foramen magnum, and on each side of it, but nearer its anterior than its posterior part, the internal openings of the anterior condyloid foramina ; the internal openings of the posterior condyloid foramina are a little external and posterior to them, protected by a small arch of bone. At this part of the internal surface there is a very deep groove, in which the posterior condyloid foramen, when it exists, has its termina- tion. This groove is continuous, in the complete skull, with the transverse groove on the posterior part of the bone, and lodges the end of the same sinus, the lateral. In front of the foramen magnum is the basilar process, presenting a shallow depression, the basilar groove, which slopes from behind, upwards and forwards, and supports the medulla oblongata and part of the pons Varolii, and on each side of the basilar process is a narrow channel, which, when united with a similar channel on the petrous portion of the temporal bone, forms a groove, w^hich lodges the inferior petrosal sinus. Angles.—The superior angle is received into the interval between the posterior superior angles of the two parietal bones: it corresponds with that part of the skull in the foetus which is called the posterior fontanelle. The inferior angle is trepresented by the square-shaped surface of the basilar process. At an early Iperiod of life, a layer of cartilag'e separates this part of the bone from the sphenoid; but in the adult, the union between them is osseous. The lateral angles corre- spond to the outer ends of the transverse grooves, and are received into the interval between the posterior inferior angles of the parietal and the mastoid portion of the temporal. I Borders.—The superior border extends on each side from the superior to the lateral angle, is deeply serrated for articulation with the parietal bone, and forms, by this union, the lambdoid suture. The inferior border extends from the lateral to |the inferior angle ; its upper half is rough, and articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal, forming the masto-occipital suture ; the inferior half articulates with the petrous portion of the temporal, forming the petro-occipital suture ; these two portions are separated from one another by the jugular process. In front of this process is a deep notch, which, with a similar one on the petrous portion of the temporal, forms the foramen lacerum posterius or jugular forameii. This aotch is occasionally subdivided into two parts by a small process of bone, and j.t generally presents an aperture at its upper part, the internal opening of the posterior condyloid foramen. Structure.—The occipital bone consists of two compact laminae, called the mter and inner tables, having between them the diploic tissue ; this bone is espe- cially thick at the ridges, protuberances, condyles, and internal part of the basilar j * Usually one of the transverse grooves is deeper and broader than the other; occasionally, both grooves are of equal depth and breadth, or both equally indistinct, irhe broader of the two transverse grooves is nearly always continuous with the vertical groove for the superior longitudinal sinus. ' t The columns of blood coming in different directions were supposed to be pressed "Ogether at this point {torcular, a wine-press).THE SKELETON process ; whilst at the bottom of the fossae, especially the inferior, it is thin, semi- transparent, and destitute of diploe. Development (fig, 132).—At birth the bone consists of four distinct parts : a ^a626/ar or expanded portion, which lies behind the foramen magnum ; two condylar parts which form the sides of the foramen ; and a basilar part which lies in front of the foramen. The number of nuclei for the tabular part vary. As a rule there are four, but there may be only one (Blandin), or as many as eight (Meckel). They appear about the eighth week of foetal life, and soon unite to form a single piece; which is, however, fissured in the direction indicated in the plate. The basilar and two condyloid portions are each developed from a single nucleus, which appears a little later. The upper portion of the tabular surface, that is to say, the portion above the transverse fissures, is developed from membrane ; the rest of the bone is developed from cartilage. At about the fourth year, the tabular and the two condyloid pieces join ; and about the sixth year, the bone consists of a single piece. At a later period, between the eighteenth and twenty-fifth years, the occipital and sphenoid become united, forming a single bone. Articulations.—With six bones : two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve pairs ; to the superior curved line are attached the Occipito-frontalis, Trapezius, and Sterno-cleido-mastoid. To the space between the curved lines, the Complexus,* Splenius capitis, and Obliquus capitis superior ; to the inferior curved line, and the space between it and the foramen magnum, the Rectus capitis posticus, major and minor; to the transverse process, the Rectus capitis lateralis ; and to the basilar process, the Rectus capitis anticus, major and minor, and Superior constrictor of the pharynx. The Parietal Bones The Parietal Bones (paries, a wall) form, by their union, the sides and roof of the skull. Each bone is of an irregular quadrilateral form, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. Surfaces.—The external surface (fig. 133) is convex, smooth, and marked about its centre by an eminence, called the parietal eminence, which indicates the point where ossification commenced. Crossing the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two well-marked curved lines or ridges, of which the lower is the more distinct and is termed the temporal ridge ; it marks the upper attachment of the temporal muscle, and follows a semicircular course across the bone. The upper ridge is less marked, and pursues a similar course across the bone, but about two- fifths of an inch above the temporal ridge ; it marks the attachment of the temporal fascia. Above these ridges, the surface of the bone is rough and porous, and covered by the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis ; between them the bone is smoother and more polished than the rest ; beloAV them the bone forms part of the temporal fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal muscle. At the back part of the superior border, close to the sagittal suture, is a small foramen, the * To these the Biventer cervicis should be added, if it is regarded as a separate muscle.139 PARIETAL BONES parietal foramen, which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital artery. Its existence is not constant, and its size varies considerably. The internal surface (fig. 134), concave, presents eminences and depressions for lodging the convolutions of the cerebrum, and numerous furrows for the rami- fications of the meningeal arteries ; the latter run upwards and backwards from the anterior inferior angle, and from the central and posterior part of the lower border of the bone. Along the upper margin is part of a shallow groove, which, when joined to the opposite parietal, forms a channel for the superior longitudinal sinus, the elevated edges of which afford attachment to the falx cerebri. Near the groove are seen several depressions, especially in the skulls of old persons ; they lodge the Pacchionian bodies. The internal opening of the parietal foramen is also seen when that aperture exists. Fig. 133.—Left parietal bone. External surface. Articulates loith oxiposite imrietal hone \ Sj)he)ioid Borders.—The suijerior, the longest and thickest, is dentated to articulate with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the sagittal suture. The inferior is divided into three parts : of these, the anterior is thin and pointed, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid ; the middle portion is arched, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped by the squamous portion of the temporal; the posterior portion is thick and serrated for articulation with the mastoid portion of the temporal. The anterior border, deeply serrated, is bevelled at the expense of the outer surface above and of the inner below ; it articulates with the frontal bone, forming the coronal suture. The jjosterior border, deeply denticulated, articulates with the occipital, forming the lamhdoid suture. Angles.—The anterior superior angle, thin and pointed, corresponds with thatI40 THE SKELETON portion of the skull which in the foetus is membranous, and is called the anterior fontanelle. The anterior inferior angle is thin and lengthened, being received in the interval between the great wing of the sphenoid and the frontal. Its inner surface is marked by a deep groove, sometimes a canal, for the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. The posterior superior angle corresponds with the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. In the foetus this part of the skull is membranous, and is called the p)osterior fontanelle. The posterior inferior angle | articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and generally presents | on its inner surface a broad, shallow groove for lodging part of the lateral sinus. Development.— The parietal bone is formed in membrane, being developed by one centre, which corresponds with the parietal eminence, and makes its first | appearance about the seventh or eighth week of foetal life. Ossification gradually extends from the centre to the circumference of the bone : the angles are conse- quently the parts last formed, and it is in their situation that the fontanelles exi^i previous to the completion of the growth of the bone. ! Articulations.—With five bones : the opposite parietal, the occipital, frontal temporal, and sphenoid. Attachment of Muscles.—One only, the Temporal. The Feontal Bone j The Frontal Bone (frons, the forehead) resembles a cockle-shell in foi"m, ar}: consists of two portions—a vertical or frontal portion situated at the anterior pa I of the cranium, forming the forehead; and a horizontal or orhito-nasal porti', which enters into the formation of the roof of the orbits and nasal fossas. ' Vertical Toition.— External Surface (f^g. 135).—In the median line, traversri the bone from the upper to the lower part, is occasionally seen a slightly elevatl; ridge, and in young subjects a suture, which represents the line of union of thetj lateral halves of which the bone consists at an early period of life : in the sA^l141 FRONTAL BONE this suture is usually obliterated, and the bone forms one piece; traces of the obliterated suture are, however, generally perceptible at the lower part. On either side of this ridge, a little below the centre of the bone, is a rounded eminence, the frontal eminence. These eminences vary in size in different individuals, and are occasionally unsymmetrical in the same subject. They are especially prominent in cases of well-marked cerebral development. The whole surface of the bone above this part is smooth, and covered by the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis muscle. Below the frontal eminence, and separated from it by a slight groove, is the sui^erciliary ridge, broad internally, where it is continuous with the nasal eminence, but less distinct as it arches outwards. These ridges are caused by the projection outwards of the frontal sinuses,* and give attachment to the Orbicularis palpebrarum and Corrugator supercilii. Between the two superciliary ridges is a Fig. 135.—Frontal bone. Outer surface. smooth surface, the glabella or nasal eminence. Beneath the superciliary ridge is the suijra-orhital arch, a curved and prominent margin, which forms the upper boundary of the orbit, and separates the vertical from the horizontal portion of the bone. The outer part of the arch is sharp and prominent, affording to the eye, in that situation, considerable protection from injury ; the inner part .is less promi- nent. At the junction of the internal and middle third of this arch is a notch, sometimes converted into a foramen by a bony process, and called the supra-orbital * Some confusion is occasioned to students commencing the study of anatomy by the name ' sinuses ' having been given to two perfectly different kinds of spaces connected with the skull. It may be as well, therefore, to state here, at the outset, that the ' sinuses' in the interior of the cranium which jjroduce the grooves on the inner surface of the bones are venous channels along which the blood runs in its passage back from the brain, while the 'sinuses' external to the cranial cavity (the frontal, sphenoidal, ethmoidal, and maxillary) are hollow spaces in the bones themselves, which communicate with the nostrils, and contain air.THE SKELETON 142 notch OY foramen. It transmits the supra-orbital artery, vein, and nerve. A small aperture is seen in the upper part of the notch, which transmits a vein from the diploe to join the supra-orbital vein. The supra-orbital arch terminates externally in the external angular process, and internally in the internal angular ijrocess. The external angular process is strong, prominent, and articulates with the malar bone ; running upwards and backwards from it are two well-marked lines, which, commencing together from the external angular process, soon diverge from each other and run in a curved direction across the bone. The lower one, the temporal ridge, gives attachment to the Temporal muscle, the upper one to the temporal fascia. Beneath them is a slight concavity, that forms the anterior part of the temporal fossa, and gives origin to the Temporal muscle. The internal angular processes are less marked than the external, and articulate with the lachrymal bones. Between the internal angular processes is a rough, uneven interval, the Fig. 136.—Frontal bone. Inner surface. nasal notch, which articulates in the middle line with the nasal bone, and on either side with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. From the concavity of this notch projects a process, the nasal process, w^hich extends beneath the nasal bones and nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones, and supports the bridge of the nose. On the under surface of this is a long pointed process, the nasal spiiie, and on either side a small grooved surface enters into the formation of the roof of the nasal fossa. The nasal spine forms part of the septum of the nose, articulating in front with the nasal bones and behind the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. Internal Surface (fig. 136).—Along the middle line is a vertical groove, the edges of which unite below to form a ridge, the fro7ital crest; the groove lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, whilst its margins afford attachment to the falx cerebri. The crest terminates below at a small notch which is converted into a foramen by articulation with the ethmoid. It is called the foramen ccecum, andFRONTAL BONE 143 varies in size in different subjects ; it is sometimes partially or completely impervious, lodges a process of the falx cerebri, and, when open, transmits a vein from the lining membrane of the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus. On either side of the groove the bone is deeply concave, presenting eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain, and numerous small furrows for lodging the ramifications of the anterior meningeal arteries. Several small, irregular fossae are also seen on either side of the groove, for the reception of the Pacchionian bodies; Horizontal Portion.—External Surface.—This portion of the bone consists of two thin plates, which form the vault of the orbit, separated from one another by the ethmoidal notch. Each orbital vault consists of a smooth, concave, triangular plate of bone, marked at its anterior and external part (immediately beneath the external angular process) by a shallow depression, the lachrymal fossa, for lodging the lachrymal gland ; and at its anterior and internal part, by a depression (some- times a small tubercle) for the attachment of the cartilaginous pulley of the Superior oblique muscle of the eye. The ethmoidal notch separates the two orbital plates ; it is quadrilateral, and filled up, when the bones are united, by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The margins of this notch present several half-cells, which, when united with corresponding half-cells on the upper surface of the ethmoid, complete the ethmoidal cells; two grooves are also seen crossing these edges transversely; they are converted into canals by articulation with the ethmoid, and are called the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals : they o^qw on the inner wall of the orbit. The anterior one transmits the nasal nerve and anterior ethmoidal vessels, the posterior one the posterior ethmoidal vessels. In front of the ethmoidal notch, on either side of the nasal spine, are the openings of the frontal sinuses. These are two irregular cavities, which extend upwards and outwards, a variable distance, between the two tables of the skull, and are separated from one another by a thin, bony septum. They give rise to the prominences above the supra-orbital arches called the superciliary ridges. In the child they are generally absent, and they become gradually developed as age advances. These cavities vary in size in different persons, are larger in men than in women, and are frequently of unequal size on the two sides, the right being commonly the larger. They are subdivided by a bony lamina, which is often dis- placed to one side. They are lined by mucous membrane, and communicate with the nose by the infundibulum, and occasionally with each other by apertures in their septum. The internal surface of the horizontal portion presents the convex upper surfaces of the orbital plates, separated from each other in the middle line by the ethmoidal notch, and marked by eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the frontal lobes of the brain. Borders.—The border of the vertical portion is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense of the internal table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the expense of the external table at each side, where it receives the lateral pressure of those bones ; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough sur- face, which articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid. The border of the hori- zontal portion is thin, serrated, and articulates with the lesser wing of the sphenoid. Structure.—The vertical portion and external angular processes are very thick, consisting of diploic tissue contained between two compact laminae. The horizontal portion is thin, translucent, and composed entirely of compact tissue; hence the facility with which instruments can penetrate the cranium through this part of the orbit. Development (fig. 137).—The frontal bone is formed in membrane, being deve- loped by tiDO centres, one for each lateral half, which make their appearance about the seventh or eighth Aveek, above the orbital arches. From this point ossification extends, in a radiating manner, upwards into the forehead, and backwards over the orbit. At birth the bone consists of two pieces, which afterwards become united, along the middle line, by a suture which runs from the vertex to the root of theTHE SKELETON 144 nose. This suture usually becomes obliterated within a few years after birth ; but it occasionally remains throughout life. Occasionally secondary centres of ossifica- tion appear for the nasal spine ; one on either side at the internal angular process where it articulates with the lachrymal bone; and sometimes there is one on either side at the lower end of the coronal suture. This latter centre sometimes remains ununited, and is known as the pterion ossicle ; or it may join with the parietal, sphenoid, or temporal bone. Articulations.^—With twelve bones : two parietal, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, and two malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To three pairs : the Corrugator supercilii. Orbicu- laris palpebrarum, and Temporal, on each side. The Temporal Bones The Temporal Bones (tempus, time) are situated at the sides and base of the skull, and present for examination a squamous, mastoid, and petrous portion. The squamous portion (squama, a scale), the anterior and upper part of the Fig. 138.—Left temporal bone. Outer surface. bone, is scale-like in form, and thin and translucent in texture (fig. 138). Its outer surface is smooth, convex, and grooved at its back part for the deep temporal arteries ; it affords attachment to the Temporal muscle, and forms part of the temporal fossa. At its back part may be seen a curved ridge—part of the temiooral ridge ; it serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia, limits the origin of the Temporal muscle, and marks the boundary between the squamous and mastoid portions of the bone. Projecting from the lower part of the squamous portion is a Fig. 137.—Frontal bone at birth. Developed by two lateral halves.TEMPORAL BONE 145 long, arched process of bone, the zygoma or zygomatic process. This process is at first directed outwards, its two surfaces looking upwards and downwards ; it then appears as if twisted upon itself, and runs forAvards, its surfaces now looking inwards and outwards. The superior border of the process is long, thin, and sharp, and serves for the attachment of the temporal fascia. The inferior, short, thick, and arched, has attached to it some fibres of the Masseter muscle. Its outer surface is convex and subcutaneous ; its inner is concave, and also affords attachment to the Masseter. The extremity, broad and deeply serrated, articulates with the malar bone. The zygomatic process is connected to the temporal bone by three divisions, called its roots—an anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior, which is short, but broad and strong, is directed inwards, to terminate in a rounded eminence, the eminentia articularis. This eminence forms the front boundary of the glenoid fossa, and in the recent state is covered with cartilage. The middle root forms the outer margin of the glenoid fossa ; running obliquely inwards, it terminates at the commencement of a well-marked fissure, the Glaserian fissure ; whilst the posterior root, which is strongly marked, runs from the upper border of the zygoma, in an arched direction, upwards and backwards, forming the posterior part of the temporal ridge. At the junction of the anterior root with the zygoma is a projection, called the tubercle, for the attachment of the external lateral ligament of the lower jaw ; and between the anterior and middle roots is an oval depression, forming part of the glenoid fossa (yXyjvrj, a socket), for the reception of the condyle of the lower jaw. This fossa is bounded, in front, by the eminentia articularis ; behind, by the tympanic plate ; and, externally, by the auditory process and middle root of the zygoma ; and is divided into two parts by a narrow slit, the Glaserian fissure. The anterior part, formed by the squamous portion of the bone, is smooth, covered in the recent state with cartilage, and articulates with the condyle of the lower jaw. This part of the glenoid fossa is separated from the auditory process by a small tubercle, the j^ost-glenoid process, the representative of a prominent tubercle which, in some of the mammalia, descends behind the condyle of the jaw, and prevents it being displaced backwards during mastication (Humphry). The posterior part of the glenoid fossa, which lodges a portion of the parotid gland, is formed chiefly by the tympanic plate, a lamina of bone, which forms the anterior wall of the tympanum and external auditory meatus. This plate of bone terminates externally in the auditory process, above in the Glaserian fissure, and below forms a sharp edge, the vaginal process, which gives origin to some of the fibres of the Tensor palati muscle. The Glaserian fissure, which leads into the tympanum, lodges the processus gracilis of the malleus, and transmits the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery. The chorda tympani nerve passes through a separate canal, parallel to the Glaserian fissure [canal of Huguier), on the outer side of the Eustachian tube, in the retiring angle between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone.* The internal surface of the squamous portion (fig. 139) is concave, presents numerous eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, and two well-marked grooves for the branches of the middle meningeal artery. Borders.—The superior border is thin, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface, so as to overlap the lower border of the parietal bone, forming the squamous suture. The anterior inferior border is thick, serrated, and bevelled, alternately at the expense of the inner and outer surfaces, for articulation with the great wing of the sphenoid. The Mastoid Portion (yu^ao-ro?, a nipple or teat) is situated at the posterior part of the bone ; its outer surface is rough, and gives attachment to the Occipito-frontalis and Retrahens aurem muscles. It is perforated by numerous foramina; one of these, of large size, situated at the posterior border of the bone, is termed the mastoid forctmen ; it transmits a vein to the lateral sinus and a small artery from the occipital, to supply the dura mater. The position and size of this foramen * This small fissure must not be confounded with the large canal which lies above the Eustachian tube and transmits the Tensor tvmpani muscle. LTHE SKELETON 146 are very variable. It is not always present; sometimes it is situated in the occipital bone, or in the suture between the temporal and the occipital. The mastoid portion is continued below into a conical projection, the mastoid process, the size and form of which vary somewhat. This process serves for the attachment of the Sterno-mastoid, Splenius capitis, and Trachelo-mastoid muscles. On the inner side of the mastoid process is a deep groove, the digastric fossa, for the attach- ment of the Digastric muscle; and, running parallel with it, but more internal, the occipital groove, which lodges the occipital artery. The internal surface of the mastoid portion presents a deep, curved groove, the fossa sigmoidea, which lodges part of the lateral sinus ; and into it may be seen opening the mastoid foramen. A section of the mastoid process shows it to be hollowed out into a number of cellular spaces, communicating with each other, called the mastoid cells ; they open by a single or double orifice into the back of the tympanum, are lined by a prolongation of its lining membrane, and probably form some secondary part Fig. 139.—Left temporal bone. Inner surface. of the organ of hearing. The spaces at the upper and front part of the bone near the opening into the tympanum are large and irregular, and contain air. They diminish in size towwds the lower part of the bone ; those situated at the apex of the mastoid process being quite small and usually containing marrow (fig. 140). The mastoid cells, like the other sinuses of the cranium, are not developed until after puberty; hence the prominence of this process in the adult. In consequence of the communication which exists between the tj-nqianuni and mastoid cells, inflammation of the lining membrane of the former cavity may easily travel back- wards to that of the mastoid cells, leading to caries and necrosis of their walls and the risk of transference of the inflammation to the lateral sinus or encephalon. Borders.—The superior border of the mastoid portion is broad and rough, its serrated edge sloping outwards, for articulation with the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. The posterior border, also uneven and serrated, articulates with the inferior border of the occipital bone between its lateral angle and jugular process.TEMPORAL BONE 147 The Petrous Portion (Trerpos, a stone), so named from its extreme density and hardness, is a pyramidal process of bone, wedged in at the base of the skull between the sphenoid and occipital bones. Its direction from without is inwards, forwards, and a little downwards. It presents for examination a base, an apex, three surfaces, and three borders ; and contains, in its interior, the essential parts of the organ of hearing. The base is applied against the internal surface of the squamous and mastoid portions, its upper half being concealed ; but its lower half is exposed by the divergence of those two portions of the bone, which brings into view the oval expanded orifice of a canal leading into the tympanum, the meatus auclitorius externus. This canal is situated in front of the mastoid process, and between the posterior and middle roots of the zygoma ; its upper margin is smooth and rounded, but the greater part of its circumference is surrounded by a curved Fig. 140.—Section through the petrous and mastoid portions of the temporal bone, showing the communication of the cavity of the tympanum with the mastoid cells. plate of bone, the auditory j^rocess, the free margin of which is thick and rough, for the attachment of the cartilage of the external ear. The apex of the ]Detrous portion, rough and uneven, is received into the angular interval between the posterior border of the greater wing of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital; it presents the anterior or internal orifice of the carotid canal, and forms the posterior and external boundary of the foramen lacerum medium. The anterior surface of the petrous portion (fig. 139) forms the posterior part of the middle fossa of the skull. This surface is continuous with the squamous portion, to which it is united by a suture, the temporal or petro-squamous suture, the remains of which are distinct even at a late period of life; it presents six points for examination : i. an eminence near the centre, which indicates the situation of the superior semicircular canal: 2. on the outer side of this eminence a depression, indicating the position of the tympanum ; here the layer of bone which separates the tympanum from the cranial cavity is extremely thin, and is known as the teg men tympani: 3. a shallow groove, sometimes double, leading outwards and backwards to an oblique opening, the hiatus Fallopii, for the passage of the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve and the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery : 4. a smaller opening, occasionally seen external to the latter, for the passage of the smaller petrosal nerve: 5. near the apex of the bone, the L 2THE SKELETON 148 termination of the carotid canal, the wall of which in this situation is deficient in front : 6. above this canal a shallow depression for the reception of the Gasserian ganglion. The posterior surface forms the front part of the posterior fossa of the skull, and is continuous with the inner surface of the mastoid portion of the bone. It presents three points for examination : i. about its centre, a large orifice, the meatus auditorius internus, whose size varies considerably ; its margins are smooth and rounded; and it leads into a short canal, about four lines in length, which runs directly outwards, and is closed by a vertical plate, the lamina cribrosa, which is divided by a horizontal crest, the crista falciformis, into two unequal portions ; the lower presenting three foramina, or sets of foramina; one, just below the posterior part of the crest, consisting of a number of small openings for the nerves to the saccule ; a second, below and posterior to this, for the nerve to the posterior semicircular canal; and a third, in front and below the first, consisting of a number of small openings which terminate in the canalis centralis cochle^^ and transmit the nerve to the cochlea ; the upper portion, that above the crista, presents behind a series of small openings for the passage of filaments to the vestibule and superior and external semicircular canals, and, in front, one large opening, the commencement of the aqu^eductus Fallopii, for the passage of the facial nerve : 2. behind the meatus auditorius, a small slit, almost hidden by a thin plate of bone, leading to a canal, the aqucBcluctus vestibidi, which transmits a small artery and vein, and lodges a process of the dura mater: 3. in the interval between these two openings, but above them, an angular depression which lodges a process of the dura mater, and transmits a small vein into the cancellous tissue of the bone. The inferior or basilar surface (fig. 141) is rough and irregular, and forms part of the base of the skull. Passing from the apex to the base, this surface presents eleven points for examination : i. a rough surface, quadrilateral in form, which Fig. 141.—Petrous portion. Inferior surface.TEMPORAL BONE 149 serves partly for the attachment of the Levator palati and Tensor tympani muscles : 2. the large, circular aperture of the carotid canal, which ascends at first vertically, and then, making a bend, runs horizontally forwards and inwards ; it transmits the internal carotid artery and the carotid plexus : 3. the aquc&chictus cochlecB, a small, triangular opening, lying on the inner side of the latter, close to the posterior border of the petrous portion ; it transmits a vein from the cochlea, which joins the internal jugular: 4. behind these openings a deep depression, the jiigidar fossa, which varies in depth and size in different skulls; it lodges the lateral sinus, and, with a similar depression on the margin of the jugular process of the occipital bone, forms the foramen lacerum posterius, or jugular foramen : 5. a small foramen for the passage of Jacobson's nerve (the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal); this foramen is seen in front of the bony ridge dividing the carotid canal from the jugular fossa : 6. a small foramen on the outer wall of the jugular fossa, for the entrance of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric (Arnold's) nerve : 7. behind the jugular fossa, a smooth, square-shaped facet, the jugular surface ; it is covered with cartilage in the recent state, and articulates with the jugular process of the occipital bone : 8. the vaginal process, a very broad, sheath-hke plate of bone, which extends backwards from the carotid canal and gives attachment to part of the Tensor palati muscle ; this plate divides behind into two laminae, the outer of which is continuous with the auditory process, the inner with the jugular process: between these laminae is the 9th point for examination, the styloid process ; a long, sharp spine, about an inch in length; it is directed downwards, forwards, and inwards, varies in size and shape, and sometimes consists of several pieces united by cartilage ; it affords attachment to three muscles, the Stylo-pharyngeus, Stylo- hyoideus, and Stylo-glossus ; and two ligaments, the stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxil- lary : 10. the stylo-mastoid foramen, a rather large orifice, placed between the styloid and mastoid processes; it is the termination of the aquaeductus Fallopii, and transmits the facial nerve and stylo-mastoid artery : 11. the auricular fissure, situated between the auditory and mastoid processes, for the exit of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve. Borders.—The superior, the longest, is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, and has attached to it the tentorium cerebelli; at its inner extremity is a semilunar notch, upon which the fifth nerve lies. The posterior border is intermediate in length between the superior and the anterior. Its inner half is marked by a groove, which, when completed by its articulation with the occipital, forms the channel for the inferior petrosal sinus. Its outer half presents a deep excavation—the jugular fossa—which, with a similar notch on the occipital, forms the foramen lacerum posterius. A projecting eminence of bone occasionally stands out from the centre of the notch, and divides the foramen into two parts. The anterior border is divided into two parts—an outer joined to the squamous portion by a suture, the remains of which are distinct; an inner, free, articulating with the spinous process of the sphenoid. At the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions are seen two canals, separated from one another by a thin plate of bone, the processus cochleariformis ; they both lead into the tympanum, the upper one transmitting the Tensor tympani muscle, the lower one the Eustachian tube. Structure.—The squamous portion is like that of the other cranial bones : the mastoid portion cellular, and the petrous portion dense and hard. Development (fig. 142).—The temporal bone is developed by ten centres, exclusive of those for the internal ear and the ossicula—viz. one for the squamous portion including the zygoma, one for the tympanic plate, six for the petrous and mastoid parts, and two for the styloid process. Just before the close of foetal life the temporal bone consists of four parts: i. The squamo-zygomatic, which is ossified in membrane from a single nucleus, which appears at its lower part about the second month. 2. The tympanic plate, an imperfect ring, which encloses the tympanic membrane. This is also ossified from a single centre, which appears rather later than that for the squamous portion. 3. The pietro-masioid, which is developed from six centres, which appear about the fifth or sixth month. Four ofTHE SKELETON Fig. 142.—Development of the temporal bone. By ten centres. 1 for tiimpanic ^ for pctroii and vuifito/d jwrtioiis 2 for styloid process these are for the petrous portion, and are placed around the labyrinth, and two for the mastoid (Yrolik). According to Huxley, the centres are more numerous, and are disposed so as to form three portions : (i) including most of the labyrinth, with a part of the petrous and mastoid, he has named prootic ; (2) the rest of the petrous, the opistliotic ; and (3) the remainder of the mastoid, the epiotic. The petro-mastoid is ossified in cartilage. 4. The styloid ^^roccss is also ossified in cartilage from two centres : one for the base, which ap- pears before birth, and is termed the tympano-hyal; the other, comprising the rest of the process, is named the stylo-hyal, and does not appear until after birth. Shortly before birth the tympanic plate joins with the squam- ous. The petrous and mastoid join with the squamous during the first year, and the tympano-hyal portion of the styloid process about the same time. The stylo-hyal does not join the rest of the bone until after puberty, and in some skulls never becomes united. The subsequent changes in this bone are, that the tympanic plate extends outwards, so as to form the meatus auditorius; the glenoid fossa becomes deeper; and the mastoid part, w^hich at an early period of life is quite flat, enlarges from the development of the cellular cavities in its interior. Articulations.—With five bones—occipital, parietal, sphenoid, inferior maxillary, and malar. Attachment of Muscles.—To fifteen: to the squamous portion, the Temporal ; to the zygoma, the Masseter; to the mastoid portion, the Occipito-frontalis, Sterno-mastoid, Splenius capitis, Trachelo-mastoid, Digastricus, and Eetrahens aurem ; to the styloid process, the Stylo-pharyngeus, Stylo-hyoideus, and Stylo- glossus ; and to the petrous portion, the Levator palati, Tensor tympani. Tensor palati, and Stapedius. The Sphenoid Bone The Sphenoid Bone (o-^r/r, a wedge) is situated at the anterior part of the base of the skull, articulating with all the other cranial bones, which it binds firmly and solidly together. In its form it soniew^hat resembles a bat with its wings extended ; and is divided into a central portion or body, two greater and two lesser wings extending outwards on each side of the body, and two processes—the pterygoid processes—which project from it below\ The body is of large size, cuboid in form, and hollowed out in its interior so as to form a mere shell of bone. It presents for examination four surfaces— a superior, an inferior, an anterior, and a posterior. The Superior Surface (fig. 143).—In front is seen a prominent spine, the ethmoidal spine, for articulation with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid ; behind this a smooth surface presenting, in the median line, a slight longitudinal emin- ence, with a depression on each side, for lodging the olfactory tracts. This surface is bounded behind by a ridge, which forms the anterior border of a narrow, transverse groove, the optic groove; it lodges the optic commissure, and terminates on either side in the optic foramen, for the passage of the optic nerve and oph- thalmic artery. Behind the optic groove is a small eminence, olive-like in shape, ihQ olivary process ; and still more posteriorly, a deep depression, the ^z'^wito?'?/SPHENOID BONE fossa, or sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary body. This fossa is perforated by numerous foramina, for the transmission of nutrient vessels into the substance of the bone. It is bounded in front by two small eminences, one on either side, called the middle clinoid ijvocesses [kXIvt], a bed), which are sometimes connected by a spiculum of bone to the anterior clinoid processes, and behind by a square- shaped plate of bone, the dorsum ephippii or dorsum sellce, terminating at each superior angle in a tubercle, the posterior clinoid processes, the size and form of which vary considerably in different individuals. These processes deepen the pituitary fossa, and serve for the attachment of prolongations from the tentorium cerebelli. The sides of the dorsum ephippii are notched for the passage of the sixth pair of nerves, and below present a sharp process, the petrosal process, which is joined to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, forming the inner boundary of the middle lacerated foramen. Behind this plate, the bone presents a shallow depression, which slopes obliquely backwards, and is continuous with the basilar groove of the occipital bone ; it is called the clivus, and supports the upper part of the pons Varolii. On either side of the body is a broad groove, curved Fig. 143.—Sphenoid bone. Superior surface. Ethmoidal something like the italic letter f; it lodges the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, and is called the carotid or cavernous groove. Along the outer margin of this groove, at its posterior part, is a ridge of bone, in the angle between the body and greater wing, called the lincjula. The posterior surface, quadrilateral in form, is joined to the basilar process of the occipital bone. During childhood these bones are separated by a layer of cartilage ; but in after-life (between the eighteenth and twenty-fifth years) this becomes ossified, ossification commencing above and extending dow^nwards ; and the two bones then form one piece. The anterior surface (fig. 144) presents, in the middle line, a vertical ridge of bone, the ethmoidal crest, which articulates in front with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, forming part of the septum of the nose. On either side of it are irregular openings leading into the sphenoidal cells or sinuses. These are two large, irregular cavities hollowed out of the interior of the body of the sphenoid bone, and separated from one another by a more or less complete perpendicular bony septum. Their form and size vary considerably ; they are seldom symmetrical, and are often partially subdivided by irregular osseous laminae. Occasionally, they extend into the basilar process of the occipital nearly as far as the foramen magnum. The septum is seldom quite vertical, being commonly bent to one or the other side.THE SKELETON These sinuses do not exist in children, hut they increase in size as age advances. They are partially closed, in front and helow, hy two thin, curved plates of bone, the sphenoidal turbinated bones, leaving a round opening at their upper parts, by which they communicate with the upper and back part of the nose, and occasionally with the posterior ethmoidal cells or sinuses. The lateral margins of this surface present a serrated edge, which articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid, completing the posterior ethmoidal cells; the lower margin, also rough and serrated, articulates with the orbital process of the palate bone ; and the upper margin with the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The inferior surface presents, in the middle line, a triangular spine, the ivstntrn, which is continuous Avith the ethmoidal crest on the anterior surface, and is received into a deep fissure between the alae of the vomer. On each side may be seen a projecting lamina of bone, which runs horizontally imvards from near the base of the pterygoid process : these plates, termed the vaginal processes, articulate with the edges of the vomer. Close to the root of the pterygoid process is a groove, formed into a complete canal when articulated with the sphenoidal process of the palate bone ; it is called the Fig. 144.—Sphenoid bone. Anterior surface.* j)terygo-palatine canal, and transmits the pterygo-palatine vessels and pharyngeal nerve. The Greater Wings are two strong processes of bone, which arise from the sides of the body, and are curved in a direction upwards, outwards, and backwards ; being prolonged behind into a sharp-pointed extremity, the spinous process of the sphenoid. Each wing presents three surfaces and a circumference. The superior OT cerebral surface (fig. 143) forms part of the middle fossa of the skull; it is deeply concave, and presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain. At its anterior and internal part is seen a circular aperture, the foramen rotundum, for the transmission of the second division of the fifth nerve. Behind and external to this is a large, oval foramen, the foramen ovale, for the trans- mission of the third division of the fifth nerve, the small meningeal artery, and sometimes the small petrosal nerve.t At the inner side of the foramen ovale, a small aperture may occasionally be seen opposite the root of the pterygoid process ; it is the foramen Vesalii, transmitting a small vein. Lastly, in the posterior angle, * In this figure, both the anterior and inferior surfaces of the body of the sphenoid bone are shown, the bone being held with the pterygoid processes almost horizontal. f The small x)etrosal nerve sometimes passes through a special foramen between the foramen ovale and foramen spinosiun.SPHENOID BONE 153 near to the spine of the sphenoid, is a short canal, sometimes double, the foramen spinosum; it transmits the middle meningeal artery. The external surface (fig. 144) is convex, and divided by a transverse ridge, the pterygoid ridge* into two portions. The superior or larger, convex from above downwards, concave from before backAvards, enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, and gives attachment to part of the Temporal muscle. The inferior portion, smaller in size and concave, enters into the formation of the zygomatic fossa, and affords attach- ment to the External pterygoid muscle. It presents, at its posterior part, a sharp- pointed eminence of bone, the spinous process, to which are connected the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and the Tensor palati muscle. The pterygoid ridge, dividing the temporal and zygomatic portions, gives attachment to part of the External pterygoid muscle. At its inner and anterior extremity is a triangular spine of bone, which serves to increase the extent of origin of this muscle. The anterior or orbital surface, smooth, and quadrilateral in form, assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit. It is bounded above by a serrated edge, for articulation wdth the frontal bone ; below, by a rounded border, which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure. Internally, it presents a sharp border, which forms the low^er boundary of the sphenoidal fissure, and has projecting from about its centre a little tubercle of bone, which gives origin to one head of the External rectus muscle of the eye ; and at its upper part is a notch for the trans- mission of a branch of the lachrymal artery: externally, it presents a serrated margin for articulation wdth the malar bone. One or two small foramina may occasionally be seen for the passage of branches of the deep temporal arteries; they are called the external orbital foramina. Circumference of the great loing (fig. 143): commencing from behind, from the body of the sphenoid to the spine, the outer half of this margin is serrated, for articulation with the petrous portion of the temporal bone; whilst the inner half forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum medium, and presents the posterior aperture of the Vidian canal for the passage of the Vidian nerve and artery. In front of the spine the circum- ference of the great wing presents a serrated edge, bevelled at the expense of the inner table below, and of the external above, which articulates with the squamous XDortion of the temporal bone. At the tip of the great wing a triangular portion is seen, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface, for articulation with the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. Internal to this is a broad, serrated surface, for articulation with the frontal bone : this surface is continuous internally with the sharp inner edge of the orbital plate, which assists in the formation of the sphenoidal fissure, and externally with the serrated margin for articulation with the malar bone. The Lesser Wings {processes of Ingrassias) are two thin, triangular plates of bone, which arise from the upper and lateral parts of the body of the sphenoid, and, projecting transversely outwards, terminate in a sharp point (fig. 143)- The superior surface of each is smooth, flat, broader internally than externally, and supports part of the frontal lobe of the brain. The inferior surface forms the back part of the roof of the orbit, and the upper boundary of the sphenoidal fissure or foramen lacerum anterius. This fissure is of a triangular form, and leads from the cavity of the cranium into the orbit; it is bounded internally by the body of the sphenoid—above, by the lesser wing ; below, by the internal margin of the orbital surface of the great wing—and is converted into a foramen by the articula- tion of this bone with the frontal. It transmits the third, the fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, the sixth nerve, some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery, a recurrent branch from the lachrymal artery to the dura mater, and the ophthalmic vein. The anterior border of the lesser wing is serrated for articulation with the frontal bone ; the posterior, smooth and rounded, is received into the fissure of Sylvius of the brain. The inner extremity of this border forms * Sometimes caUed infra-temporal crest.THE SKELETON 154 the anterior clinoid process. The lesser wing is connected to the side of the body by two roots, the upper thin and flat, the lower thicker, obliquely directed, and presenting on its outer side, near its junction with the body, a small tubercle, for the attachment of the common tendon of three of the muscles of the e3-e. Between the two roots is the ojHic foramen, for the transmission of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The Pterygoid Processes {-n-Tepv^, a icing ; elSo?, likeness), one on each side, descend perpendicularly from the point where the body and greater wing unite (fig. 145). Each process consists of an external and an internal plate, separated behind by an intervening notch—the lAerygoid fossa ; but joined partially in front. The external pterygoid plate is broad and thin, turned a little outwards, and forms part of the inner wall of the zygomatic fossa. It gives attachment, by its outer sur- face, to the External ptery- goid ; its inner surface forms part of the pterygoid fossa, and gives attachment to the Internal pterygoid. The in- ternal pterygoid plate is much narrower and longer, curving outwards, at its extremity, into a hook-like process of bone, the hamular process, around which turns the tendon of the Tensor palati muscle. On the posterior surface of the base of this plate is a small, oval, shallow depression, the scaphoid fossa, from which arises the Tensor palati, and above which is seen the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal. Below and to the inner side of the Vidian canal, on the posterior surface of the base of this plate, is a little prominence, which is known by the name of the pterygoid tubercle. The outer surface of this plate forms part of the pterygoid fossa, the inner surface forming the outer boundary of the posterior aperture of the nares. The Superior constrictor of the pharynx is attached to its posterior edge. The two pterygoid plates are separated below by an angular interval, in which the pterygoid process, or tuberosity, of the palate bone is received. The anterior surface of the pterygoid process is very broad at its base, and forms the posterior wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa. It supports Meckel's ganglion. It presents, above, the anterior orifice of the Vidian canal; and below, a rough margin, which articulates with the perpendicular plate of the palate bone. The Sphenoidal Spongy Bones are two thin, curved plates of bones, which exist as separate pieces until puberty, and occasionally are not joined to the sphenoid in the adult. They are situated at the anterior and inferior part of the body of the sphenoid, an aperture of variable size being left in their anterior wall, through which the sphenoidal sinuses open into the nasal fossas. They are irregular in form, and taper to a point behind, being broader and thinner in front. Their upper surface, which looks towards the cavity of the sinus, is concave ; their under surface convex. Each bone articulates in front with the ethmoid, externally with the palate ; its pointed posterior extremity is placed above the vomer, and is received between the root of the pterygoid process on the outer side, and the rostrum of the sphenoid on the inner.* Development.—Up to about the eighth month of foetal life the sphenoid bone * A small portion of the sphenoidal turbinated bone sometimes enters into the forma- tion of the inner wall of the orbit, between the os planum of the ethmoid in front, the orbital plate of the palate below, and the frontal above. Cleland, Roy. Soc. Trans. 1862. Fig. 145.—Sphenoid bone. Posterior surface.ETHMOID BONE 155 consists of two distinct parts : a posterior or j^ost-sphenoid part, which com- prises the pituitary fossa, the greater wings, and the pterygoid processes ; and an anterior or 'pre-s]jhcnoid part, to which the anterior part of the body and lesser wings belong. It is developed by fourteen centres : eight for the posterior sphenoid division, and six for the anterior sphenoid. The eight centres for the posterior sphenoid are—one for each greater wing and external pterygoid plate, one for each internal pterygoid plate, two for the posterior part of the body, and one Fig. 146.—Plan of the development of sphenoid, on each side for the lingula. The six for the anterior sphenoid are one for each lesser wing, tw^o for the anterior part of the body, and one for each sphenoidal turbinated bone. Post-sphenoid Division. — The first nuclei to appear are those for the greater wings. They make their appearance between the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale about the eighth Aveek, and from them the external pterygoid plates are also formed. Soon after, the nuclei for the posterior part of the body appear, one on either side of the sella turcica, and become blended together about the middle of fcetal life. About the fourth month the remaining four centres appear, those for the internal pterygoid plates being ossified in membrane and becoming joined to the external pterygoid plate about the sixth month. The centres for the lingulae speedily become joined to the rest of the bone. Pre-sphenoid Division.—The first nuclei to appear are those for the lesser wings. They make their appearance about the ninth week, at the outer borders of the optic foramina. A second pair of nuclei appear on the inner side of the foramina shortly after, and, becoming united, form the front part of the body of the bone. The remaining two centres for the sphenoidal turbinated bones do not make their appearance until the end of the third year. The pre-sphenoid is united to the body of the post-sphenoid about the eighth month, so that at birth the bone consists of three pieces—viz. the body in the centre, and on each side the great wings wdth the pterygoid processes. The lesser wings become joined to the body at about the time of birth. At the first year after birth the greater wings and body are united. From the tenth to the twelfth year the spongy bones are partially united to the sphenoid, their junction being complete by the twentieth year. Lastly, the sphenoid joins the occipital from the eighteenth to the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—The sphenoid articulates with all the bones of the cranium, and five of the face—the two malar, two palate, and vomer: the exact extent of articulation with each bone is shown in the accompanying figures.* Attachment of Muscles.—^To eleven pairs : the Temporal, External pterygoid. Internal pterygoid, Superior constrictor. Tensor palati. Levator palpebrse, Obliquus oculi superior, Superior rectus. Internal rectus. Inferior rectus, External rectus. The Ethmoid Bone The Ethmoid {rjdjjios, a sieve) is an exceedingly light, spongy bone, of a cubical form, situated at the anterior part of the base of the cranium, between the two orbits, at the root of the nose, and contributing to form each of these cavities. It consists of three parts : a horizontal plate, which forms part of the base of the * It also sometimes articulates with the tuberosity of the superior maxilla (seep. 161).

The Horizontal or Cribriform Plate (fig. 147) forms part of the anterior fossa of the base of the skull, and is received into the ethmoid notch of the frontal Fig. 147.—Ethmoid bone. Outer surface of right pl'ites. Projecting upwards bulging; in which case it is found to enclose a small sinus.* On each side of the crista galli, the cribriform plate is narrow, and deeply grooved, to support the bulb of the olfactory tract, and perforated by foramina for the passage of the olfactory nerves. These foramina are arranged in three rows : the innermost, which are the largest and least numerous, are lost in grooves on the upper part of the septum ; the foramina of the outer row are continued on to the surface of the upper spongy bone. The foramina of the middle row are the smallest; they perforate the bone, and transmit nerves to the roof of the nose. At the front part of the cribriform plate, on each side of the crista galli, is a small fissure, which transmits the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve; and at its posterior part a triangular notch, which receives the ethmoidal spine of the sphenoid. The Perpendicular Plate (fig. 148) is a thin, flattened lamella of bone, which descends from the under surface of the cribriform plate, and assists in forming the septum of the nose. It is much thinner in the middle than at the circum- ference, and is generally deflected a little to one side. Its anterior border articu- lates with the nasal spine of the frontal bone and crest of the nasal bones. Its posterior, divided into two parts, articulates by its upper half with the ethmoidal crest of the sphenoid, by its lower half with the vomer. The inferior border serves for the attachment of the triangular cartilage of the nose. On each side of the perpendicular plate numerous grooves and canals are seen, leading from foramina on the cribriform plate ; they lodge filaments of the olfactory nerves. The Lateral Masses of the ethmoid consist of a number of thin-walled cellular cavities, the ethmoidal cells, interposed between two vertical plates of bone, the outer one of which forms part of the orbit, and the inner one part of the nasal fossa of the corresponding side. In the disarticulated bone many of these cells appear to be broken ; but when the bones are articulated, they are closed in at every part. The upper surface of each lateral mass presents a number of apparently half-broken cellular spaces; these ar£ closed in when articulated by the edges of the ethmoidal notch of the frontal bone. Crossing this surface are two grooves on * Sir George Humphry states that the crista galli is commonly inclined to one side, usually the opposite to that towards which the lower part of the perpendicular plate is bent.—The Human Skeleton, 1858, p. 277. bone between the two orbital u'<M infMurhmcUed 6- lateral mass (enlarged). from the middle line of this plate is a thick, smooth, triangular process of bone, the crista galli, so called from its resemblance to a cock's comb. Its base joins the cribriform plate. Its pos- terior border, long, thin, and slightly curved, serves for the attachment of the falx cerebri. Its anterior border, short and thick, articulates with the frontal bone, and presents two small projecting alas, which are received into cor- responding depressions in the frontal, completing the fora- men caecum behind.

The cells at the anterior surface are completed by the lachrymal bone and nasal process of the superior maxillary, and those below also by the superior maxillary. The outer surface of each lateral mass is formed of a thin, smooth, square plate of bone, called the OS planum; it forms part of the inner wall of the orbit, and articu- lates, above, with the orbital plate of the frontal; below, with the superior maxillary; in front, with the lachrymal; and behind, Avith the sphenoid and orbital process of the palate. From the inferior part of each lateral mass, immediately beneath the os planum, there projects downwards and backwards an irregular lamina of bone, called the unciform process, from its hook-like form: it serves to close in the upper part of the orifice of the antrum, and articulates with the ethmoidal process of the inferior turbinated bone. It is often broken in disarticulating the bones. The inner surface of each lateral mass forms part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa of the corresponding side. It is formed of a thin lamella of bone, which descends from the under surface of the cribriform plate, and terminates below in a free, convoluted margin, the middle turbinated bone. The whole of this surface is rough, and marked above by Fig. 149.—Ethmoid bone.

The former, more numerous, communicate with the frontal sinuses above, and the middle meatus below, by means of a long, flexuous canal, the infimdibuhim ; the posterior, less numerous, open into the superior meatus, and communicate (occasionally) with the sphenoidal sinuses. Development.—By tJn-ee centres : one for the perpendicular lamella, and one for each lateral mass. The lateral masses are first developed, ossific granules making their appear- ance in the os planum between the fourth and fifth months of foetal life, and extending into the spongy bones. At birth, the bone consists of the two lateral masses, which are small and ill-developed. During the first year after birth, the perpendicular and horizontal plates begin to ossify, from a single nucleus, and become joined to the lateral masses about the beginning of the second year. The formation of the ethmoidal cells, which completes the bone, does not commence until about the fourth or fifth year. Articulations.—With fifteen bones : the sphenoid, two sphenoidal turbinated, the frontal, and eleven of the face—the two nasal, two superior maxillary, two lachrymal, two palate, two inferior turbinated, and the vomer. No muscles are attached to this bone. The early stages of the development of the cranium have already been described (see page 85). We have seen that it is formed from a layer of niesoblast, deriA ed from the protovertebral plates of the trunk, which is spread over the whole surface of the rudimen- tary brain. That portion of this la^-er from which the bones of the skull are to be developed consists of a thin, membranous capsule. Ossification connnences in the roof, and is preceded by the deposition of a mem- branous blastema upon the surface of the cerebral capsule, in which the ossifying pro- cess extends; the primitive membranous capsule becomin^^ the internal periosteum, and Fig. 150.—Skull at birth, showing the Fig. 151.—The lateral fontanelles. anterior and posterior fontanelles. being ultimately blended with the dura mater. x\lthough the bones of the vertex of the skull appear before those at the base, and make considerable progress in their ^a-owth, at birth ossification is more advanced in the base, this portion of tlie skull forming a solid, inmiovable groundwork. Before birth, the bones at the vertex and side of the skull are separated from each other by membranous intervals, in which bone is deficient. These intervals are princii)ally found at the four angles of the parietal bones. Hence there are six fontanelles. Then- formation is due to the wave of ossification being circular and the bones quadrilateral ; the ossific matter first meets at the margins of the bones, at the points nearest to their centres of ossification, and vacuities or spaces are left at the angles, which are called fontanelles, so named from the pulsations of the brain, which are perceptible at the Development of the Cranium The FontanellesNASAL BONE 159 anterior foutanelle, and were likened to the rising of water in a fountain. The anterior fontanelle is the largest, and corresponds to the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures; the posterior fontanelle, of smaller size, is situated at the junction of the sagittal and lamhdoid sutiu-es; the remaining ones are situated at the inferior angles of each parietal bone. The latter are closed soon after birth; the two at the two superior angles remain open longer; the posterior being closed in a few months after birth; the anterior remaining open until the first or second year. These spaces are gradually filled in by an extension of the ossifying process, or by the development of a Wormian bone. Some- times the anterior fontanelle remains open beyond two years, and is occasionally persistent throughout life. Supernumerary or Wormian* Bones In addition to the constant centres of ossification of the skull, additional ones are occasionally found in the com'se of the sutures. These form irregular, isolated bones, interposed between the cranial bones, and have been termed Wormian bodies or ossa triquetra. They are most frequently found in the course of the lambdoid suture, but occasionally also occupy the situation of the fontanelles, especiall}^ the posterior and, more rarely, the anterior. Frequently one is found between the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid, the i^^^rion ossicle (fig. 151). They have a great tendency to be symmetrical on the two sides of the skull, and they vary much in size, being in some cases not larger than a pin's head, and confined to the outer table; in other cases so large that one pair of these bones may form the whole of the occipital bone above the superior curved lines, as described by Beclard and Ward. Their number is generally limited to two or three; but more than a hundred have been found in the skull of an adult hydrocephalic skeleton. In their development, structure, and mode of articulation, they resemble the other cranial bones. Congenital Fissures and Gaps Atl arrest in the ossifying process may give rise to deficiencies, or gaps ; or to fissures, which are of importance in a medico-legal point of view, as they are liable to be mistaken for fractures. The fissures generally extend from the margins towards the centre of the bone, but the gaps may be found in the middle as well as at the edges. In course of time they may become covered with a thin lamina of bone. Bones of the Face The Facial Bones are fourteen in number—viz. the Two Nasal. Two Palate. Two Superior Maxillary. Two Inferior Turbinated. Two Lachrymal. Vomer. Two Malar. Inferior Maxillary. ' Of these, the upper and lower jaws are the fundamental bones for mastication, and the others are accessories ; for the chief function of the facial bones is to provide an apparatus for mastication, while subsidiary functions are to provide for the sense-organs (eye, nose, tongue) and a vestibule to the respiratory and vocal organs. Hence the variations in the shape of the face in man and the lower animals depend chiefly on the question of the character of their food and their mode of obtaining it.' f Nasal Bone The Nasal (nasus, the nose) are two small oblong bones, varying in size and form in different individuals ; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face, forming, by their junction, ' the bridge ' of the nose. Each bone presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The outer surface is concave from above downwards, convex from side to side ; it is covered by the Pyramidalis and Compressor nasi muscles, and gives attachment at its upper part to a few^ fibres of the Occipito-frontalis muscle (Theile). It is marked by numerous small arterial furrows, and perforated about its centre by a foramen, sometimes * Wormius, a physician in Copenhagen, is said to have given the first detailed descrip- tion of these bones. t W. W. Keen. American edition, p. 185.THE SKELETON i6o Fig double, for the transmission of a small vein. Sometimes this foramen is absent on one or both sides, and occasionally the foramen caecum opens on this surface. The inner surface is concave from side to side, convex from above downwards ; in which direction it is traversed by a lonoitudinal groove (sometimes a canal), for the passage of a branch of the nasal nerve. The superior border is narrow, thick, and serrated for articulation with the nasal notch of the frontal bone. The inferior border is broad, thin, sharp, inclined obliquely downwards, outwards, and back- wards, and serves for the attachment of the lateral cartilage of the nose. This border presents, about its middle, a notch, through which passes the branch of the nasal nerve above referred to ; and is prolonged at its inner extremity into a sharp spine, which, when Fig. 152.—Eight nasal bone, articulated with the opposite bone, fornis the nasal angle. The external border is ser- rated, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface above, and of the external below, to articulate with the nasal process of the superior maxillary. The internal Outer Surface border, thicker above than below, articulates with its fellow of the opposite side, and is prolonged behind into a vertical crest, which forms part of the septum of the nose : this crest articulates with the nasal spine of the frontal above, and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid below.

Its careful examination becomes, therefore, a matter of considerable interest. It is the largest bone of the face, excepting the lower jaw, and forms, by its union with its fellow of the opposite side, the whole of the upper jaw. Each bone assists in the formation of three cavities, the roof of the mouth, the floor and outer wall of the nasal fossae, and the floor of the orbit; and also enters into the formation of two fossae, the zygomatic and spheno- maxillary, and two fissures, the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary. The bone presents for examination a body and four processes—malar, nasal, alveolar, and palate. The body is somewhat cuboid, and is hollowed out in its interior to form a large cavity, the antrum of Highmore. Its surfaces are four—an external or facial, a posterior or zygomatic, a superior or orbital, and an internal. The external or facial surface (fig. 154) is directed forwards and outwards. Just above the incisor teeth is a depression, the incisive or myrtiform fossa, which gives origin to the Depressor alae nasi; and, below it, to the alveolar border is attached a slip of the Orbicularis oris. Above and a little external to it, the Compressor nasi arises. More external is another depression, the canine fossa, larger and deeper than the incisive fossa, from which it is separated by a vertical ridge, the canine eminence, corresponding to the socket of the canine tooth. The canine fossa gives origin to the Levator anguli oris. Above the canine fossa is thei6i SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE infra-orbital foramen, the termination of the infra-orbital canal; it transmits the infra-orbital vessels and nerve. Above the infra-orbital foramen is the margin of the orbit, which affords partial attachment to the Levator labii superioris proprius. To the sharp margin of bone which bounds this surface in front and separates it from the internal surface is attached the Dilator naris posterior. The posterior or zygomatic surface is convex, directed backwards and out- wards, and forms part of the zygomatic fossa. It presents about its centre several apertures leading to canals in the substance of the bone ; they are termed the posterior dental canals, and transmit the posterior dental vessels and nerves. At the lower part of this surface is a rounded eminence, the maxillary tuberosity, especially prominent after the growth of the wisdom-tooth, rough on its inner side for articulation with the tuberosity of the palate-bone and sometimes with the external pterygoid plate. It gives attachment to a few fibres of origin of the Internal pterygoid muscle. Immediately above the rough surface is a groove, which, running obliquely down on the inner surface of the bone, is converted Fig. 154.—Left superior maxillary bone. Outer surface. Outer Surface. into a canal by articulation with the palate-bone, forming the p)osterior palatine canal. The superior or orbital surface is thin, smooth, triangular, and forms part of the floor of the orbit. It is bounded internally by an irregular margin which in front presents a notch, the lachrymal notch, which receives the lachrymal bone; in the middle articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid, and behind with the orbital process of the palate-bone ; bounded externally by a smooth, rounded edge which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure, and which sometimes articulates at its anterior extremity with the orbital plate of the sphenoid; bounded in front by part of the circumference of the orbit, which is continuous, on the inner side with the nasal, on the outer side with the malar process. Along the middle line of the orbital surface is a deep groove, the infra-orbital, for the passage of the infra-orbital vessels and nerve. The groove commences at the middle of the outer border of this surface, and, passing forwards, terminates in a canal, which subdivides into two branches. One of the canals, the m'THE SKELETON l62 infra-orbital, opens just below the margin of the orbit; the other, which is smaller, runs in the substance of the anterior wall of the antrum ; it is called the anterior dental canal, and transmits the anterior dental vessels and nerve to the fi-ont teeth of the upper jaw. From the back part of the infra-orbital canal, a second small canal is sometimes given off, Avhich runs in the substance of the bone, and conveys the middle dental nerve to the bicuspid teeth. Occasionally, this canal is derived from the anterior dental. At the inner and fore part of the orbital surface, just external to the lachrymal groove for the nasal duct, is a depression, which gives origin.to the Inferior oblique muscle of the eye. . The internal surface (fig. 155) is unequally divided into two parts by a hori- zontal projection of bone, the palate j^'i'ocess : the portion above the palate process forms part of the outer wall of the nasal fossae; that below it forms part of the cavity of the mouth. The superior division of this surface presents a large, irre- gular opening leading into the antrum of Highmore. At the upper border of this aperture are numerous broken cellular cavities, which, in the articulated skull, are Fig. 155.—Left superior maxillary bone. Inner surface. closed in by the ethmoid and lachrymal bones. Below the aperture is a smooth concavity which forms part of the inferior meatus of the nasal fossae, and behind it is a rough surface which articulates with the perpendicular plate of the palate bone, traversed by a groove which, commencing near the middle of the posterior border, runs obliquely downwards and forwards, and forms, when completed by its articulation with the palate-bone, the posterior 'palatine canal. In front of the opening of the antrum is a deep groove, converted into a canal by the lachrymal and inferior turbinated bones. It is called the lachiymal groove, and lodges the nasal duct. More anteriorly is a well-marked rough ridge, the inferior tur- binated crest, for articulation with the inferior turbinated bone. The concavity above this ridge forms part of the middle meatus of the nose ; whilst that below it forms part of the inferior meatus. The portion of this surface below the palate process is concave, rough and uneven, and perforated by numerous small foramina for the passage of nutrient vessels. It enters into the formation of the roof of the mouth. The Antrum of Highmore, or Maxillary Sinus, is a large, pyramidal cavity.SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE 163 hollowed out of the body of the maxillary bone : its apex, directed outwards, is formed by the malar process ; its base, by the outer wall of the nose. Its walls are everywhere exceedingly thin, and correspond to the orbital, facial, and zygomatic surfaces of the body of the bone. Its inner wall, or base, presents, in the dis- articulated bone, a large, irregular aperture, which communicates with the nasal fossa. The margins of this aperture are thin and ragged, and the aperture itself is much contracted by its articulation with the ethmoid above, the inferior turbinated below, and the palate-bone behind.* In the articulated skull, this cavity com- municates with the middle meatus of the nasal fossae, generally by two small aper- tures left between the above-mentioned bones. In the recent state, usually only one small opening exists, near the upper part of the cavity, sufficiently large to admit the end of a probe, the other being closed by the lining membrane of the sinus. Crossing the cavity of the antrum are often seen several projecting laminae of bone, similar to those seen in the sinuses of the cranium; and on its posterior wall are the posterior dental canals, transmitting the posterior dental vessels and nerves to the teeth. Projecting into the floor are several conical processes, corresponding to the roots of the first and second molar teeth ; j in some cases the floor is perforated by the teeth in this situation. It is from the extreme thinness of the walls of this cavity that we are enabled to explain how a tumour growing from the antrum encroaches upon the adjacent parts, pushing up the floor of the orbit, and displacinof the eyeball, projecting inwards into the nose, protruding forwards on to the cheek, and making its way backwards into the zygo- matic fossa, and downwards into the mouth. The Malar Process is a rough, triangular eminence, situated at the angle of separation of the facial from the zygomatic surface. In front it is concave, forming part of the facial surface; behind, it is also concave, and forms part of the zygo- matic fossa ; above, it is rough and serrated for articulation with the malar bone ; whilst below, a prominent ridge marks the division between the facial and zygo- matic surfaces. A small part of the Masseter muscle arises from this process. The Nasal Process is a thick, triangular plate of bone, which projects upwards, inwards, and backwards, by the side of the nose, forming part of its lateral boundary. Its external surface is concave, smooth, perforated by numerous foramina, and gives attachment to the Levator labii superioris al^eque nasi, the Orbicularis palpebrarum, and Tendo oculi. Its internal surface forms part of the outer wall of the nose : at its upper part it presents a rough, uneven surface, which articulates with the ethmoid bone, closing in the anterior ethmoidal cells ; below this is a transverse ridge, the superior tnrhinated crest, for articulation with the middle turbinated bone of the ethmoid, bounded below by a smooth concavity which forms part of the middle meatus ; below this again is the inferior turbinated crest (already described), where the process joins the body of the bone. Its upper border articulates with the frontal bone. The anterior border of the nasal process is thin, directed obliquely downwards and forwards, and presents a serrated edge for articulation with the nasal bone ; its ijosterior border is thick, and hollowed into a groove, the lachrymal groove, for the nasal duct: of the two margins of this groove, the inner one articulates with the lachrymal bone, the outer one forms part of the circumference of the orbit. Just where the latter joins the orbital surface is a small tubercle, the lachrymal tubercle ; this serves as a guide to the position of the lachrymal sac in the operation for fistula lachrymalis. The lachrymal groove in the articulated skull is converted into a canal by the lachrymal bone and lachrymal process of the inferior turbinated ; it is directed downwards, and a little backwards and outwards, is about the diameter of a goose-quill, slightly * In some cases, at any rate, the lachrymal bone encroaches slightlj^ on the anterior superior portion of the opening, and assists in forming the inner wall of the antrum. t The number of teeth whose fangs are in relation with the floor of the antrum is variable. The antrum ' may extend so as to be in relation to all the teeth of the true maxilla, from the canine to the dens sapientice.'—See Mr. Salter on Abscess of the Antrum, in a System of Surgery, edited by T. Hohues, 2nd edit. vol. iv. p. 356. M 2164 THE SKELETON narrower in the midclle than at either extremity, and terminates below in the inferior meatus. It lodges the nasal duct. The Alveolar Process is the thickest and most spongy part of the bone, broader behind than in front, and excavated into deep cavities for the reception of the teeth. These cavities are eight in number, and vary in size and depth according to the teeth they contain. That for the canine tooth is the deepest; those for the molars are the widest, and subdivided into minor cavities ; those for the incisors are single, but deep and narrow. The Buccinator muscle arises from the outer surface of this process, as far forward as the first molar tooth. The Palate Process, thick and strong, projects horizontally inwards from the inner surface of the bone. It is much thicker in front than behind, and forms a considerable part of the floor of the nostril and the roof of the mouth. Its inferior surface (fig. 156) is concave, rough and uneven, and forms part of the roof of the mouth. This surface is perforated by numerous foramina for the passage of the nutrient vessels, channelled at the back part of its alveolar border Fio. 156.—The palate and alveolar arch. Anteriorpalati)ie canal Posterior])alatine canal Accesaorij palatine foramen by a longitudinal groove, sometimes a canal, for the transmission of the posterior palatine vessels, and the anterior and external palatine nerves from Meckel's gan- glion, and presents little depressions for the lodgment of the palatine glands. When the two superior maxillary bones are articulated together, a large orifice may be seen in the middle line, immediately behind the incisor teeth. This is the anterior jKilatine canal or fossa. This canal, as it passes through the thickness of the palate process, is divided into four compartments ; that is to say, two canals branch off laterally to the right and left nasal fossae, and two canals, one in front and one behind, lie in the middle line. The former pair of these canals is named the foranmia of Stenson, and through them passes the anterior or terminal branch of the descending or posterior palatine arteries, which ascends from the mouth to the nasal fossae. The remaining pair of canals is termed the foramina of Scarpa, and transmit the naso-palathie nerves, the left passing through the anterior, and the right through the posterior canal. On the palatal surface of the process, a delicate linear suture may sometimes be seen extending from the anterior palatine fossa to the interval between the lateral incisor and the canineSUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE 165 tooth. This marks out the intermaxillary, or incisive bone, which in some animals exists permanently as a separate piece. It includes the whole thickness of the alveolus, the corresponding part of the floor of the nose and the anterior nasal spine, and contains the sockets of the incisor teeth. One or two small foramina in the alveolar margin behind the incisor teeth are occasionally seen in the adult, almost constantly in the young subject. They are called the incisive foramina, and transmit vessels and nerves to the incisor teeth. The u;pper surface is concave from side to side, smooth, and forms part of the floor of the nose. It presents the upper orifices of the foramina of Stenson and Scarpa, the former being on each side of the middle line, the latter being situated in the intermaxil- lary suture, and therefore not visible unless the two bones are placed in apposition. The outer border of the palate process is incorporated with the rest of the bone. The inner border is thicker in front than behind, and is raised above into a ridge, the nasal crest, which, with the corresponding ridge in the opposite bone, forms a groove for the reception of the vomer. In front, this crest rises to a considerable height, and this portion is named the incisor crest. The anterior margin is bounded by the thin, concave border of the opening of the nose, prolonged forwards internally into a sharp process, forming, with a similar process of the opposite bone, the a7i^e/7'or7i«saZs^;r;ie. HYiq posterior -pm. 157. Development of border is serrated for articulation with the horizontal plate of the palate-bone. Development.—This bone commences to ossify at a very early period, and ossification proceeds in it with gi'eat rapidity, so that it is difficult to ascertain with certainty its precise number of centres. It appears, however, probable that it is ossified by five primary and two secondary centres. The primary centres appear about the seventh or eighth week ; first, one each for the facial surface, the posterior part of the alveolus, and the orbital plate, and a few days later one for the palate process, and one for the front part of the alveolus, which carries the incisor teeth, and which corresponds to the pre-maxillary bone of the lower animals. All these, except the last, speedily fuse, and the two secondary centres, one for the nasal process and the other for the malar process, appear and join the rest of the bone. By the tenth week the bone consists of two portions : the greater part of the bone formed of six out of the seven centres and the pre-maxillary portion. The suture between these two portions on the palate persists till middle life, but is not to be seen on the facial surface. This is believed by Callender to be due to the fact that the front wall of the sockets of the incisive teeth is not formed by the pre-maxillary bone, but by an outgrowth from the facial part of the superior maxilla. The antrum appears as a shallow groove on the inner surface of the bone at an earlier period than any of the other nasal sinuses, its development commencing about the fourth month of foetal life. The sockets for the teeth are formed by the growing downwards of two plates from the dental groove, which subsequently becomes divided by partitions jutting across from the one to the other. Articulations.—With nine bones : two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and seven of the face—viz. the nasal, malar, lachrymal, inferior turbinated, palate, vomer, and its fellow of the opposite side. Sometimes it articulates with the orbital plate of the sphenoid, and sometimes mth its external pterygoid plate. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve : the Orbicularis palpebrarum, ObKquus oculi inferior, Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. Levator labii superioris proprius. Levator anguli oris. Compressor nasi. Depressor alae nasi, Dilatator naris posterior, Masseter, Buccinator, Internal pterygoid, and Orbicularis oris. superior maxillary bone. At birth. Inferior Surface.i66 THE SKELETON Changes produced ix the Uppee Jaw by Age At birth and during infancy the diameter of the bone is greater in an antero-posterior than in a vertical direction. Its nasal process is long, its orbital surface large, and its tuberosity well marked. In the adult the vertical diameter is the greater, owing to the development of the alveolar process and the increase in size of the antrum. In old age the bone approaches again in character to the infantile condition : its height is diminished, and after the loss of the teeth the alveolar process is absorbed, and the lower part of the bone contracted and diminished in thickness. The Lachrymal Bone The Lachrymal (lachryma, a tear) are the smallest and most fragile bones of the face. They are situated at the front part of the inner wall of the orbit, and resemble somewhat in form, thinness, and size, a finger-nail; hence they are termed the ossa unguis. Each bone presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The external or orbital surface (fig. 158) is divided by a vertical ridge, the lachrymal crest, into two parts. The por- tion of bone in front of this ridge presents a smooth, concave, longitudinal groove, the free margin of which unites with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, completing the lachrymal groove. The upper part of this groove lodges the lachrymal sac ; the loAver part lodges the nasal duct. The portion of bone behind the ridge is smooth, slightly concave, and forms part of the inner wall of the orbit. The ridge, with a part of the orbital surface immediately behind it, affords attachment to the Tensor tarsi: the ridge terminates below in a small, hook-like projec- tion, the hamular process, which articulates with the lachrymal tubercle of the superior maxillary bone, and completes the upper orifice of the lachrymal groove. It sometimes exists as a separate piece, which is then called the lesser laclinjmal hone. The internal or nasal surface presents a depressed furrow, corresponding to the ridge on its outer surface. The surface of bone in front of this forms part of the middle meatus ; and that behind it articulates wdth the ethmoid bone, filling in the anterior ethmoidal cells. Of the/o/n- borders, the anterior is the longest, and articulates with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The 2^osterior, thin and uneven, articulates with the OS planum of the ethmoid. The s2iyerior, the shortest and thickest, articulates with the internal angular process of the frontal bone. The inferior is divided by the lower edge of the vertical crest into two parts : the posterior part articulates with the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone; the anterior portion is prolonged downwards into a pointed process, which articulates with the lachrymal process of the inferior turbinated bone, and assists in the formation of the lachrymal groove. Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance soon after ossifi- cation of the vertebr£e has commenced. Articulations.—With four bones : two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and t^^'o of the face, the superior maxillary and the inferior turbinated. Attachment of Muscles.—To one muscle, the Tensor tarsi. The Malar Bone The Malar (mala, the cJieek) are two small, quadrangular bones, situated at the upper and outer part of the face : they form the prominence of the cheek, part of the outer wall and floor of the orbit, and part of the temporal and zygomatic fossae. Each bone presents for examination an external and an internal surface ; Fig. 158.—Left lachrymal bone. External surface. (Slightly enlarged.) witA Frontal167 MALAR BONE four processes, the frontal, orbital, maxillary, and zygomatic ; and four borders. The external surface (fig. 159) is smooth, convex, perforated near its centre by one or two small apertures, the malar foramina, for the passage of nerves and vessels, covered by the Orbicu- laris palpebrarum muscle, and affords attachment to the Zy- Fig. i SQ.-Left malar bone. Outer surface. sphenoid, part of the floor and §1^,^ outer wall of the orbit. Its in- fero-external surface, smooth and convex, forms part of the zygomatic and temporal fossae. Its anterior margin^ is smooth and rounded, forming part of the circumference of the orbit. Its siqjerior margin, rough, and directed horizontally, articulates with the frontal bone behind the external angular process. Its ijosterior margin is rough, and serrated for articu- lation w^ith the sphenoid ; internally it is also serrated for articulation with the orbital surface of the superior maxillary. At the angle of junction of the sphe- ^noidal and maxillary portions, a short, rounded, non-articular margin is generally seen ; this forms the anterior boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure : occasion- ally, no such non-articular margin exists, the fissure being completed by the direct -junction of the maxillary and sphenoid bones, or by the interposition of a small Wormian bone in the angular interval between them. On the upiier surface of the orbital process are seen the orifices of one or two temporo-malar canals ; one of these usually opens on the posterior surface, the other (occasionally two) on the facial surface: they transmit filaments (temporo-malar) of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary process is a rough, triangular surface which articulates with the superior maxillary bone. The zygomatic process, gomaticus major and minor muscles. The internal surface (fig. 160), directed backwards and inwards, is concave, presenting internally a rough, triangular surface, for articulation with the superior maxillary bone; and externally, a smooth, concave surface, which above forms the anterior boundary of the tem- poral fossa, and below, where it is wider, forms part of the zygo- matic fossa. This surface pre- sents, a little above its centre, the aperture of one or two malar canals, and affords attachment to part of two muscles, the Tem- poral above and the Masseter below. Of the four processes, the frontal is thick and serrated, and articulates wdth the external angular process of the frontal bone. The orbital process is a thick and strong plate, which projects backwards from the orbital margin of the bone. Its supero-internal surface, smooth and concave, forms, by its junc- tion with the orbital surface of the superior maxillary bone and with the great wing of the Fig. 160.—Left malar bone. Inner surface.THE SKELETON i68 long, narrow, and serrated, articulates with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. Of the four borders, the antero-superior or orbital is smooth, arched, and forms a considerable part of the circumference of the orbit. The antero-inferior or maxillary border is rough, and bevelled at the expense of its inner table, to articulate with the superior maxillary bone ; affording attachment by its margin to the Levator labii superioris proprius, just at its point of junction with the superior maxillary. The postero-siiperior or temi^oral border, curved like an italic letter /, is continuous above with the commencement of the temporal ridge ; below, with the upper border of the zygomatic arch : it affords attachment to the temporal fascia. The postero-inferior or zygomatic border is continuous with the lower border of the zygomatic arch, affording attachment by its rough edge to the Masseter muscle. Development.—The malar bone ossifies generally from two, but occasionally from three, centres. One, which forms the chief part of the bone, appears about the seventh week, near the orbital margin. The second appears somewhat later, along the lower margin. The third, when it exists, is found in the hinder border. The bone is sometimes, after birth, seen to be divided, by a horizontal suture, into an upper and larger division, and a lower and smaller. This divided condition is probably due to the persistent separation of the two centres of ossification. In some quadrumana the malar bone consists of two parts, an orbital and a malar, which are ossified by separate centres. Articulations.—With four bones : three of the cranium, frontal, sphenoid, and temporal; and one of the face, the superior maxillary. Attachment of Muscles.—To five: the Levator labii superioris proprius, Zygomaticus major and minor, Masseter, and Temporal. The Palate Bone The Palate Bones (palatum, the palate) are situated at the back part of the nasal fossae: they are wedged in between the superior maxillary bones and the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. Each bone assists in the formation of three cavities: the floor and outer wall of the nose, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbit; and enters into the formation of two fossae : the spheno-maxillary and pterygoid ; and one fissure, the spheno-maxillary. In form the palate-bone some- what resembles the letter L, and may be divided into an inferior or horizontal plate and a superior or vertical plate. The Horizontal Plate is thick, of a quadrilateral form, and presents two surfaces and four borders. The superior surface, concave from side to side, forms the back part of the floor of the nostril. The inferior surface, slightly concave and rough, forms the back part of the hard palate. At its posterior part may be seen a transverse ridge, more or less marked, for the attachment of part of the aponeurosis of the Tensor palati muscle. At the outer extremity of this ridge is a deep groove converted into a canal by its articulation with the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, and forming the posterior palatine canal. Near this groove, the orifices of one or two small canals, accessory posterior palatine, may be seen. The anterior border is serrated, bevelled at the expense of its inferior surface, and articulates with the palate process of the superior maxillary bone. The posterior hoY([ev is concave, free, and serves for the attachment of the soft palate. Its inner extremity is sharp and pointed and, when united with the opposite bone, forms a projecting process, the posterior nasal spine, for the attach- ment of the Azygos uvulae. The external border is united with the lower part of the perpendicular plate almost at right angles. The internal border the thickest, is serrated for articulation with its fellow of the opposite side; its superior edge is raised into a ridge, which, united with the opposite bone, forms a crest in which the vomer is received. The Vertical Plate (fig. i6i) is thin, of an oblong form, and directed upwards169 PALATE BONE Maxillary surface Superior meatus Spheno-palatine for. and a little inwards. It presents two surfaces, an external and an internal, and four borders. The internal surface presents at its lower part a broad, shallow depression, which forms part of the inferior meatus of the nose. Immediately above this is a well-marked, horizontal ridge, the inferior turhi- Fig. 161.—Left palate bone. Liternal view. (Enlarged.) netted crest, for articula- tion with the inferior tur- binated bone; above this, a second broad, shallow de- pression, which forms part of the middle meatus, sur- mounted abc^'e by a hori- zontal ridge less prominent than the inferior, the superior turbinated crest, for articulation with the middle turbinated bone. Above the superior turbi- nated crest is a narrow, horizontal groove, which forms part of the superior meatus. The external surface is rough and irregular throughout the greater part of its extent, for articulation with the inner surface of the superior maxillary bone, its upper and back part being smooth where it enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fossa; it is also smooth in front, where it covers the orifice of the antrum. Towards the back part of this surface is a deep groove, converted into a canal, the posterior palatine, by its articulation with the superior maxillary bone. It transmits the posterior or descending palatine vessels, descending palatine branches from Maxillary process HORIZONTAL PLATE and one of the Meckel's ganglion. Fig. 162.—Left palate bone. (Enlarged.) Posterior view. Spheno-palatine foramen Sphenoidal process Articular portioji Non-articular portion EXTERNAL SUBFACE The anterior border is thin, irregular, and presents, opposite the inferior turbinated crest, a pointed, projecting lamina, the maxillary process, which is directed forwards, and closes in the lower and back part of the opening of the antrum. The posterior border (fig. 162) pre- sents a deep groove, the edges of which are serrated for articulation with the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. At the lower part of this border is seen a pyramidal process of bone, the pterygoid process or tuberosity of the palate, which is received into the angular interval between the two pterygoid plates of the sphenoid at their inferior extremity. This process presents at its back part a median groove and two lateral surfaces. The groove is smooth, and forms part of the pterygoid fossa affording attachment to the Internal pterygoid muscle ; whilst the lateral surfaces are rough and uneven, for articulation with the anterior border of each pterygoid AZYCOE UVUL* RIZOMTA L PLATE Posterior nasal spineTHE SKELETON plate. A few fibres of the Superior constrictor arise from the tuberosity of the palate-bone. The base of this process, continuous with the horizontal portion of the bone, presents the apertures of the accessory descending iKilatine canals, through which pass the two smaller descending branches of Meckel's ganglion; whilst its outer surface is rough for articulation with the inner surface of the body of the superior maxillary bone. The superior border of the vertical plate presents two well-marked processes separated by an intervening notch or foramen. The anterior, or larger, is called the orbital process ; the posterior, the sphenoidal. The Orbital Process, directed upwards and outwards, is placed on a higher level than the sphenoidal. It presents five surfaces, which enclose a hollow cellular cavity, and is connected to the perpendicular plate by a narrow, constricted neck. Of these five surfaces, three are articular, two non-articular or free ^rfaces. The three articular are the anterior or maxillary surface, which is directed forwards, outwards, and downwards, is of an oblong form, and rough for articulation with the superior maxillary bone. The posterior or sphenoidal surface is directed backwards, upwards, and inwards. It ordinarily presents a small,* open cell, which communicates with the sphenoidal cells, and the margins of which are serrated for articulation with the vertical part of the sphenoidal turbinated bone. The internal or ethmoidal surface is directed inwards, upwards, and forwards, and articulates with the lateral mass of the ethmoid bone. In some cases, the cellular cavity above mentioned opens on this surface of the bone ; it then communicates with the posterior ethmoidal cells. More rarely it opens on both surfaces, apd then communicates both with the posterior ethmoidal and the sphenoidal cells. The non-articular or free surfaces are the superior or orbital, directed upwards and outwards, of triangular form, concave, smooth, and forming the back part of the floor of the orbit; and the external or zycjoinatic surface, directed outwards, backwards, and downwards, of an oblong form, smooth, lying in the spheno- maxillary fossa, and looking into the zygomatic fossa. The latter surface is separated from the orbital by a smooth, rounded border, which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fissure. The Sphenoidal Process of the palate-bone is a thin, compressed plate, much smaller than the orbital, and directed upwards and inwards. It presents three surfaces and two borders. The superior surface, the smallest of the three, arti- culates with the under surface of the sphenoidal turbinated bone ; it presents a groove, which contributes to the formation of the pterygo-palatine canal. The internal surface is concave, and forms part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The external surface is divided into an articular and a non-articular portion : the former is rough, for articulation with the inner surface of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid ; the latter is smooth, and forms part of the spheno-maxillary fossa. The anterior border forms the posterior boundary of the spheno-ioalatine foramen. The posterior border, serrated at the expense of the outer table, articulates with the inner surface of the pterygoid process. The orbital and sphenoidal processes are separated from one another by a deep notch, which is converted into a foramen, the spheric-palatine, by articulation with the sphenoidal turbinated bone. Sometimes the two processes are united above, and form between them a complete foramen, or the notch is crossed by one or more spiculse of bone, so as to form two or more foramina. In the articulated skull, this foramen opens into the back part of the outer wall of the superior meatus, and transmits the spheno-palatine vessels and the superior nasal and naso-palatine nerves. Development.—From a single centre, which makes its appearance about the second month at the angle of junction of the two plates of the bone. From this point ossification spreads inwards to the horizontal plate, downwards into the tuberosity, and upwards into the vertical plate. In the foetus, the horizontal plate is much longer than the vertical ; and even after it is fully ossified, the whole bone is at first remarkable for its shortness.171 INFERIOR TURBINATED BONES Articulations.—With six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, inferior turbinated, vomer, and opposite palate. Attachment of Muscles.—To four : the Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae. Internal pterygoid, and Superior constrictor of the pharynx. The Infeeiok Turbinated Bones The Inferior Turbinated Bones (turbo, a tchirl) are situated one on each side of the outer wall of the nasal fossa?. Each consists of a layer of thin, spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll—hence its name ' turbinated'—and extends hori- zontally along the outer wall of the nasal fossa, immediately below the orifice of the antrum. Each bone presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The internal surface (fig. 163) is convex, perforated by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves and canals for the lodgment of arteries and Fig. 163.—Eight inferior turbinated bone. Fig. 164.—Right inferior turbinated Internal surface. bone. External surface. veins. In the recent state it is covered by the lining membrane of the nose. The external surface is concave (fig. 164), and forms part of the inferior meatus. Its tipper border is thin, irregular, and connected to various bones along the outer wall of the nose. It may be divided into three portions ; of these, the anterior articulates with the inferior turbinated crest of the superior maxillary bone; the posterior with the inferior turbinated crest of the palate-bone ; the middle portion of the superior border presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and form. Of these, the anterior and smallest is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths of the bone: it is small and pointed, and is called the lachrymal pirocess ; it articulates, by its apex, with the anterior inferior angle of the lachrymal bone, and, by its margins, with the groove on the back of the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and thus assists in forming the canal for the nasal duct. At the junction of the tw^o middle fourths of the bone, but encroaching on its posterior fourth, a broad, thin plate, the ethmoidal process, ascends to join the unciform process of the ethmoid ; from the lower border of this process a thin lamina of bone curves downwards and outw^ards, hooking over the lower edge of the orifice of the antrum, which it narrows below: it is called the maxillary process, and fixes the bone firmly on to the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The inferior border is free, thick, and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle of the bone. Both extremities are more or less narrow and pointed, the posterior being the more tapering. If the bone is held so that its outer con- cave surface is directed backwards (i.e. towards the holder), and its superior border, from which the lachrymal and ethmoidal processes project, upwards, the lachrymal process will be directed to the side to which the bone belongs.* Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance about the middle of fcBtal life. Articulations.—With four bones : one of the cranium, the ethmoid, and three of the face, the superior maxillary, lachrymal, and palate. No muscles are attached to this bone. * If the lachrymal process is broken off, as is often the case, the side to which the bone belongs may be known by recollecting that the maxillary process is nearer the back than the fi'ont of the bone.172 THE SKELETON The Vomer The Vomer (vomer, a ploughshare) is a single bone, situated vertically at the back part of the nasal fossae, forming part of the septum of the nose. It is thin, somewhat like a ploughshare in form ; but it varies in different individuals, being frequently bent to one or the other side ; it presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The lateral surfaces are smooth, marked by small furrows for the lodgment of blood-vessels, and by a groove on each side, sometimes a canal, the naso-palatine, which runs Fig. 165.—The vomer. obliquely downwards and for- wards to the intermaxillary suture ; it transmits the naso- palatine nerve. The superior border, the thickest, presents a deep groove, bounded on each side by a horizontal pro- jecting ala of bone ; the groove receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, whilst the alae are overlapped and retained by laminae (the vaginal processes) which project from the under surface of the body of the sphenoid at the base of the pterygoid processes. At the front of the groove a fissure is left for the transmission of blood-vessels to the substance of the bone. The inferior border, the longest, is broad and uneven in front, where it articulates with the two superior maxillary bones ; thin and sharp behind, where it joins with the palate-bones. The upper half of the anterior border usually consists of two laminae of bone, between which is received the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid ; the lower half, also separated into two lamellae, receives between them the lower margin of the triangular cartilage of the nose. The posterior border is free, concave, and separates the j nasal fossae behind. It is thick and bifid above, thin below. ! The surfaces of the vomer are covered by mucous membrane, which is intimately I connected with the periosteum, with the intervention of very little, if any, sub-, mucous connective tissue. Hence polypi are rarely found growing from this surface, | though they frequently grow from the outer wall of the nasal fossae, where thej submucous tissue is abundant. I Development.—The vomer at an early period consists of two laminae, separatedj by a very considerable interval, and enclosing between them a plate of cartilage,; which is prolonged forwards to form the remainder of the septum. Ossification commences in it by a single centre about the eighth week. From this nucleus the two laminae are formed. They begin to coalesce at the lower part, but their uniot is not complete until after puberty. Articulations.—With six bones : two of the cranium, the sphenoid and ethmoid: and four of the face, the two superior maxillary and the two palate-bones ; and witt the cartilage of the septum. The vomer has no muscles attached to it. The Infeeior Maxillary Bone The Inferior Maxillary Bone (the Mandible), the largest and strongest boni of the face, serves for the reception of the lower teeth. It consists of a curved I horizontal portion, the body, and two perpendicular portions, the rami, which joi]| the back part of the body nearly at right angles. I The Horizontal Portion, or Body (fig. 166), is convex in its general outline, an«j|173 INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE curved somewhat like a horse-shoe. It presents for examination two sm-faces and two borders. The external surface is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards. In the median line is a vertical ridge, the symphysis, which extends from the upper to the lower border of the bone, and indicates the point of junction of the two pieces of which the bone is composed at an early period of life. The lower part of the ridge terminates in a prominent triangular eminence, the mental process. This eminence is rounded below, and often presents a median depression separating two processes, the mental tubercles. It forms the chin, a feature peculiar to the human skull. On either side of the symphysis, just below the cavities for the incisor teeth, is a depression, the incisive fossa, for the attachment of the Levator menti (or Levator labii inferioris) ; more externally is attached a portion of the Orbicularis oris (Accessorii Orbicularis inferioris), and, still more externally, a foramen, the mental foramen, for the passage of the mental vessels and nerve. This foramen is placed just below the interval between the two bicuspid teeth. Running outwards from the base of the mental process on each side is a ridge, the external oblique line. The ridge is at first nearly Fig. 166.—Inferior maxillary bone. Outer surfacec Side Corouoid process Cooidyle horizontal, but afterwards inclines upwards and backwards, and is continuous jwith the anterior border of the ramus : it affords attachment to the Depressor [labii inferioris and Depressor anguli oris ; below it the Platysma myoides is jittached. The internal surface (fig. 167) is concave from side to side, convex from above iownwards. In the middle line is an indistinct linear depression, corresponding 10 the symphysis externally ; on either side of this depression, just below its centre, |ire four prominent tubercles, placed in pairs, two above and two below ; they are iialled the genial tubercles, and afford attachment, the upper pair to the Grenio- lyo-glossi muscles, the lower pair to the Genio-hyoidei muscles. Sometimes the ubercles on each side are blended into one, at others they all unite into an irregular iminence, or again, nothing but an irregularity may be seen on the surface of the j)one at this part. On either side of the genial tubercles is an oval depression, the Hihlingual fossa, for lodging the sublingual gland ; and beneath the fossa, a rough jlepression on each side, which gives attachment to the anterior belly of the Digastric muscle. At the back part of the sublingual fossa, the internal oblique ine (mylo-hyoiclean) commences ; it is at first faintly marked, but becomes more iistinct as it passes upwards and outwards, and is especially prominent opposite he last two molar teeth ; it affords attachment throughout its whole extent to theTHE SKELETON 174 I Mylo-hyoid muscle: the Superior constrictor of the pharynx with the pterygo- maxillary hgament, being attached above its posterior extremity, near the alveolar margin. The portion of bone above this ridge is smooth, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth ; the portion below presents an oblong depression, the suhnaxillary fossa, wider behind than in front, for the lodgment of the sub- maxillary gland. The external oblique line and the internal or mylo-hyoidean line divide the body of the bone into a superior or alveolar and an inferior or basilar portion. The superior or alveolar border is wider, and its margins thicker, behind than in front. It is hollowed into numerous cavities, for the reception of the teeth ; these cavities are sixteen in number, and vary in depth and size according to the j teeth which they contain. To its outer side, the Buccinator muscle is attached as ! far forward as the first molar tooth. The inferior border is rounded, longer than the superior and thicker in front than behind; it presents a shallow groove, just ! where the body joins the ramus, over which the facial artery turns. j The Perpendicular Portions, or Rami, are of a quadrilateral form. Each Fig. 167.—Inferior maxillary bone. Inner surface. Side view. ' Articulation with temjioral presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and two processes. The'^ external surface is flat, marked wdth ridges, and gives attachment throughout nearly the whole of its extent to the Masseter muscle. The internal surface presentsi about its centre the oblique aperture of the inferior dental canal, for the passage} of the inferior dental vessels and nerve. The margin of this opening is irregular ; it presents in front a prominent ridge, surmounted by a sharp spine, the linguhy ■ which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and at its lower and back part a notch leading to a groove, the viylo-Jiyoiclean, which runs obliquely downwards to the back part of the submaxillary fossa, and lodges thei mylo-hyoid vessels and nerve. Behind the groove is a rough surface, for thei insertion of the Internal pterygoid muscle. The inferior dental canal runs obliquel}i downwards and forwards in the substance of the ramus, and then horizontall}^ forwards in the body; it is here placed under the alveoli, with Avhich it communi ) cates by small openings. On arriving at the incisor teeth, it turns back t( communicate with the mental foramen, giving off two small canals, which rur forward, to be lost in the cancellous tissue of the bone beneath the incisor teeth This canal, in the posterior two-thirds of the bone, is situated nearer the interna : surface of the jaw; and in the anterior third, nearer its external surface. Itf|!INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE 175 walls are composed of compact tissue at either extremity, and of cancellous in the centre. It contains the inferior dental vessels and nerve, from which branches are distributed to the teeth through small apertures at the bases of the alveoli. The loiver border of the ramus is thick, straight, and continuous with the body of the bone. At its junction with the posterior border is the angle of the jaiv, which is either inverted or everted, and marked by rough, oblique ridges on each side, for the attachment of the Masseter externally, and the Internal pterygoid internally; the stylo-maxillary ligament is attached to the bone between these muscles. The anterior border is thin above, thicker below, and continuous with the external oblique line. The posterior border is thick, smooth, rounded, and covered by the parotid gland. The upper border of the ramus is thin, and presents two processes, separated by a deep concavity, the sigmoid notch. Of these processes, the anterior is the coronoid, the posterior the condyloid. The Coronoid Process is a thin, flattened triangular eminence of bone, which varies in shape and size in different subjects, and serves chiefly for the attachment of the Temporal muscle. Its external surface is smooth, and affords attachment fco the Temporal muscle. Its mternal surface gives attachment to the Temporal muscle, and presents the commencement of a longitudinal ridge, which is continued bo the posterior part of the alveolar process. On the outer side of this ridge is a ieep groove, continued below on the outer side of the alveolar process ; this ridge 'md part of the groove afford attachment, above, to the Temporal; below, to the Buccinator muscle. The Condyloid Process, shorter but thicker than the coronoid, consists of two portions: the condyle, and the constricted portion which supports the condyle, the lecli. The condyle is of an oblong form, its long axis being transverse, and set )bHquely on the neck in such a manner that its outer end is a little more forward md a little higher than its inner. It is convex from before backwards, and from iide to side, the articular surface extending further on the posterior than on the mterior aspect. The neck of the condyle is flattened from before backwards, and itrengthened by ridges which descend from the fore part and sides of the condyle, ts lateral margins are narrow, and present externally a tubercle for the external ateral ligament. Its posterior surface is convex; its anterior is hollowed out m its inner side by a depression (the pterygoid fossa) for the attachment of the External pterygoid. 1 The Sigmoid Notch, separating the two processes, is a deep semilunar depres- ion, crossed by the masseteric vessels and nerve. Development.—The lower jaw is developed principally from membrane, but !)artly from cartilage. The process of ossification commences early—before, indeed, j,ny bone except the clavicle. Between the fifth and sixth week a centre of ossifi- ation appears in the membrane on the outer surface of Meckel's cartilage (see fpage 88), from which the greater part of the bone is found. A second centre jppears in the membrane on the inner surface of the tooth sockets, from which the mer wall of the sockets of the teeth is formed, this terminates above in the lingula. -he anterior extremity of Meckel's cartilage becomes ossified, forming the body of ;he bone on each side of the symphysis. And, finally, two supplemental patches of artilage appear at the condyle and at the angle, in which centres of ossification br these parts appear. At birth the bone consists of two halves, united by a brous symphysis, in which ossification takes place during the first year. Articulation.—With the glenoid fossae of the two temporal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To fifteen pairs ; to its external surface, commencing it the symphysis, and proceeding backwards: Levator menti, Depressor labii Iliferioris, Depressor anguli oris, Platysma myoides. Buccinator, Masseter ; a portion f the Orbicularis oris (Accessorii Orbicularis inferioris) is also attached to this arface. To its internal surface, commencing at the same point: Genio-hyo- lossus, Genio-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Digastric, Superior constrictor. Temporal, uternal pterygoid. External pterygoid.176 THE SKELETON Changes produced in the Lower Jaw by Age The changes which the Lower Jaw undergoes after bn^th, relate (i) to the alterations effected in the body of the bone by the first and second dentitions, the loss of the teeth in the aged, and the subsequent absorption of the alveoli; (2) to the size and situation of the dental canal; and (3) to the angle at which the ramus joins with the body. At birth (fig. 168), the bone consists of lateral halves, united by fibrous tissue. The body is a mere shell of bone, containing the sockets of the two incisor, the canine, and the two temporary molar teeth, imperfectly j)artitioned from one another. The dental canal is of large size, and runs near the lower border of the bone, the mental foramen opening beneath the socket of the first molar. The angle is obtuse (175°), and the cond^doid portion nearly in the same horizontal line with the body; the neck of the condyle is short, and bent backwards. The coronoid process is of comparatively large size, and situated at right i angles with the rest of the bone. After hirtJi (fig. 169), the two segments of the bone become joined at the symphysis, : from below upwards, in the first year ; but a trace of separation may be visible in the ; beginning of the second year, near the alveolar margin. The bod^' becomes elongated in I its whole length, but more especially behind the mental foramen, to provide space for the j three additional teeth developed in this part. The depth of the body becomes greater, ' owing to increased growth of the alveolar part, to afford room for the fangs of the teeth, and by thickening of the subdental portion which enables the jaw to withstand the power- ful action of the masticatory muscles; but the alveolar portion is the deeper of the two, and, consequently, the chief part of the body lies above the oblique line. The dental canal, after the second dentition, is situated just above the level of the mylo-hyoid ridge; and the mental foramen occupies the position usual to it in the adult. The angle becomes less obtuse, owing to the separation of the jaws by the teeth. (About the fourth year it is 140°) In the adult (fig. 170), the alveolar and basilar portions of the body are usually of equal depth. The mental foramen opens midway between the upper and lower border of the bone, and the dental canal rims nearly parallel with the mylo-hyoid line. The ramus is almost vertical in direction, and joins the body nearly at right angles. In old age (fig. 171), the bone becomes greatly reduced in size ; for with the loss of the j| teeth the alveolar process is absorbed, and the basilar part of the bone alone remains; |j consequently, the chief part of the bone is below the oblique line. The dental canal, ;] with the mental foramen opening from it, is close to the alveolar border. The rami are 1, oblique in direction, the angle obtuse, and the neck of the condyle more or less bent !j backwards. THE SUTUKES The bones of the cranium and face are connected to each other by means of Sutures. That is, the articulating surfaces or edges of the bones are more or less roughened or uneven, and are closely adapted to each other, a small amount of intervening fibrous tissue fastening them together. The Cranial Sutures may be divided into three sets : i. Those at the vertex of the skull. 2. Those at the side of the skull. 3. Those at the base. The sutures at the vertex of the skull are three : the sagittal, coronal, and. lamhdoid. The Sagittal Suture {interparietal) is iovm^di by the junction of the two parietal bones, and extends from the middle of the frontal bone, backwards to the superior ; angle of the occipital. In childhood, and occasionally in the adult, when the two halves of the frontal bone are not united, it is continued forwards to the root of the nose. This suture is sometimes perforated, near its posterior extremity, by; the parietal foramen ; and in front, where it joins the coronal suture, a space is occasionally left, which encloses a large Wormian bone. The Coronal Suture (fronto-jjarietal) extends transversely across the vertex of the skull, and connects the frontal with the parietal bones. It commences at the, extremity of the greater wing of the sphenoid on one side, and terminates at the, same point on the opposite side. The dentations of the suture are more marked at the sides than at the summit, and are so constructed that the frontal rests or the parietal above, whilst laterally the frontal supports the parietal. The Lambdoid Suture (occijnto-parietal), so called from its resemblance to tb Greek letter A, connects the occipital with the parietal bones. It commences 01 each side at the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and inclines upwards to thtTHE SUTURES Side View op the Lower Jaw at different Periods of Li Fig. 168.—At birth.

The dentations of this suture are very deep and distinct, and are often interrupted by several small Wormian bones. The sutures at the side of the skull extend from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the lower end of the lambdoid suture behind. The anterior portion is formed between the lateral part of the frontal bone above and the malar and great wing of the sphenoid below, forming the fronto-malar and fronto- sphenoidal sutures. These sutures can also be seen in the orbit, and form part of the so-called transverse facial suture. The posterior portion is formed between the parietal bone above and the great wing of the sphenoid, the squamous and mastoid portions of the temporal bone, forming the sj^heno-jMrietal, squamo-jjarietal, and j masto-parietal sutures. I The Spheno-parietal is very short; it is formed by the tip of the great wing of i the sphenoid, which overlaps the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. ! The Squamo-parietal, or Squamous Suture, is arched. It is formed by the squamous portion of the temporal bone overlapping the middle division of the lower border of the parietal. The Masto-parietal is a short suture, deeply dentated, formed by the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, and the superior border of the mastoid portion of the i temporal. The sutures at the base of the skull are, the basilar in the centre, and on each side, the petro-occipital, the masto-occipital, the petro-sphenoiclal, and the squamo- sphenoiclal. The Basilar Suture is formed by the junction of the basilar surface of the occipital bone with the posterior surface of the body of the sphenoid. At an early period of life a thin plate of cartilage exists between these bones ; but in the adult | they become fused into one. Between the outer extremity of the basilar suture | and the termination of the lambdoid, an irregular suture exists, which is subdivided I into two portions. The inner portion, formed by the union of the petrous part of I the temporal with the occipital bone, is termed the petro-occipital. The outer ij portion, formed by the junction of the mastoid part of the temporal with the || occipital, is called the masto-occipital. Between the bones forming the petro- occipital suture, a thin plate of cartilage exists; in the masto-occipital is occa- sionally found the opening of the mastoid foramen. Between the outer extremity of the basilar suture and the spheno-parietal, an irregular suture may be seen, J formed by the union of the sphenoid with the temporal bone. The inner and | smaller portion of this suture is termed the petro-sphenoidal; it is formed between 1 the petrous portion of the temporal and the great wing of the sphenoid : the outer j portion, of greater length, and arched, is formed between the squamous portion i; of the temporal and the great wing of the sphenoid ; it is called the squamo- ;] sphenoidal. : The cranial bones are connected with those of the face, and the facial bones : with each other, by numerous sutures, which, though distinctly marked, have i received no special names. The only remaining suture deserving especial con- | sideration is the transverse. This extends across the upper part of the face, and \ is formed by the junction of the frontal with the facial bones : it extends from the i external angular process of one side to the same point on the opposite side, and ! connects the frontal with the malar, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the lachrymal, the superior maxillary, and the nasal bones on each side. The sutures remain separate for a considerable period after the complete form- ation of the skull. It is probable that they serve the purpose of permitting the growth of the bones at their margins ; while their peculiar formation, together with the interposition of the sutural ligament between the bones forming them, i prevents the dispersion of blows or jars received upon the skull. Humphry remarks * that, as a general rule, the sutures are first obliterated at the parts in which the ossification of the skull was last completed—viz. in the neighbourhood, of the fontanelles ; and the cranial bones seem in this respect to observe a similar law to that which regulates the union of the epiphyses to the shafts of the long179 BASE OF THE SKULL bones.' The same author remarks that the time of theu* disappearance is extremely variable : they are sometimes fomid well marked in skulls edentulous with age, while in others which have only just reached maturity they can hardly be traced. THE SKULL The Skull, formed by the union of the several cranial and facial bones already described, when considered as a whole, is divisible into five regions : a superior region or vertex, an inferior region or base, two lateral regions, and an anterior region, the face. Vertex of the Skull The Superior Region, or Vertex, presents two surfaces, an external and an internal. The external surface is bounded, in front, by the glabella and supra-orbital ridges; behind, by the occipital protuberance and superior curved lines of the occipital bone ; laterally, by an imaginary line extending from the outer end of the superior curved line, along the tem^Doral ridge, to the external angular process of the frontal. This surface includes the vertical portion of the frontal, the greater part of the parietal, and the superior third of the occipital bone ; it is smooth, convex, of an elongated oval form, crossed transversely by the coronal suture, and from before backwards by the sagittal, which terminates behind in the lambdoid. The point of junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures is named the bregma, and is represented by a line drawn vertically upwards from the external auditory meatus, the head being in its normal position. The point of junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures is called the lambda, and is about 2J inches above the external occipital protuberance. From before backwards may be seen the frontal eminences and remains of the suture connecting the two lateral halves of the frontal bone ; on each side of the sagittal suture are the parietal foramen and parietal eminence, and still more posteriorly the convex surface of the occipital bone. In the neigh- bourhood of the parietal foramen the skull is often flattened, and to this region the name of ohelion is sometimes given. The internal surface is concave, presents eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the cerebrum, and numerous furrows for the lodgment of branches of the meningeal arteries. Along the middle line of this surface is a longitudinal groove, narrow in front, where it commences at the frontal crest; but broader behind, where it lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, and by its margin affords attachment to the falx cerebri. On either side of it are several depressions for the Pacchionian bodies, and at its back part, the internal openings of the parietal I foramina. This surface is crossed, in front, by the coronal suture ; from before ! backwards, by the sagittal; behind, by the lambdoid. Base of the Skull The Inferior Region, or Base of the Skull, presents two surfaces—an internal or cerebral, and an external or basilar. The internal or cerebral surface (fig. 172) joresents three fossae, called the anterior, middle, and posterior fossae of the cranium. The Anterior Fossa is formed by the orbital plates of the frontal, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, the anterior third of the superior surface of the body, and the jupper surface of the lesser wings of the sphenoid. It is the most elevated of the jthree fossae, convex externally where it corresponds to the roof of the orbit, concave 111 the median line in the situation of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. It is ifcraversed by three sutures, the ethmo-frontal, ethmo-sphenoidal, and fronto- sphenoidal; and lodges the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. It presents, in the median line, from before backwards, the commencement of the groove for the puperior longitudinal sinus, and the frontal crest for the attachment of the falx I N 2i8o THE SKELETON cerebri; the foramen ccecum, an aperture formed between the frontal bone and the crista galli of the ethmoid, which, if pervious, transmits a small vein from the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus ; behind the foramen csecum, the crista galli, the ■piQ^ 172.—Base of the skull.

On the outer side of each olfactory groove are the internal openings of the anterior and 'posterior ethmoidal foramina ; the former, situated about the middle of the outer margin of the olfactory groove, transmits the anterior ethmoidal vessels and the nasal nerve, which latter runs in a depression along the surface of the ethmoid, to the slit-like opening above mentioned ; whilst the posterior ethmoidal foramen opens at the back part of this margin under cover of the projecting lamina of the sphenoid, and transmits the posterior ethmoidal vessels. Further back in the middle line is the ethmoidal spine, bounded behind by an elevated ridge, sepa- rating two longitudinal grooves which support the olfactory tracts. Behind this is a transverse sharp ridge, running outwards on either side to the anterior margin of the optic foramen, and separating the anterior from the middle fossa of the base of the skull. The anterior fossa presents, laterally, eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain, and grooves for the lodgment of the anterior meningeal arteries. The Middle Fossa, somewhat deeper than the preceding, is narrow in the middle line, but becomes wider at the side of the skull. It is bounded in front by the posterior margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, the anterior clinoid process, and the ridge forniing the anterior margin of the optic groove; behind, by the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal, and the dorsum ephippii;; externally by the squamous portion of the temporal, anterior inferior angle of the - parietal bone, and greater wing of the sphenoid. It is traversed by four sutures, ' the squamo-parietal, spheno-parietal, squamo-sphenoidal, and petro-sphenoidal. In the middle line, from before backwards, is the optic groove, which supports the optic commissure, ■ and terminates on each side in the optic foramen, for the passage of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery ; behind the optic groove is the olivary process, and laterally the anterior clinoid processes, to which are attached processes of the tentorium cerebelli. Further back is the sella turcica, a deep depression, which lodges the pituitary gland, bounded in front by a small eminence on either side, the middle clinoid process, and behind by a broad square plate of bone, the dorsum ephippii, surmounted at each superior angle by a tubercle, the posterior clinoid process ; beneath the latter process is a notch, for the sixth nerve. On each side of the sella turcica is the cavernous groove: it is broad, shallow, and curved somewhat like the italic letter /; it commences behind at the foramen lacerum medium, and terminates on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process, and presents along its outer margin a ridge of bone. This groove lodges the cavernous sinus, the internal carotid artery, and the nerves of the orbit. The sides of the middle fossa are of considerable depth ; they present eminences and depressions for the convolutions of the brain, and grooves for the branches of the middle meningeal artery ; the latter commence on the outer side of the foramen spinosum, and consist of two large branches, an anterior and a posterior; the former passing upwards and forwards to the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, the latter passing upwards and backwards. The following foramina may also be seen from before backwards. Most anteriorly is the foramen lacerum anterius, or sphenoidal fissure, formed above by the lesser wing of the sphenoid ; below, by the greater wing ; internally, by the body of the sphenoid ; and sometimes completed externally by the orbital plate of the frontal bone. It transmits the third, the fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, the sixth nerve, some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery, a recurrent branch from the lachrymal artery to the dura mater, and the ophthalmic vein. Behind the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure is the foramen rotundum, for the passage of the second division of the fifth or superior maxillary nerve; still more posteriorly is seen a small orifice, the foramen Vesalii, an opening situated between the foramen rotundum and ovale, a little internal to both : it varies in size m different individuals, and is often absent; when present, it transmits a small vein. It opens below into the pterygoid fossa, just at the outer side of the scaphoidl82 THE SKELETON depression. Behind and external to the latter opening is the foramen ovale, which transmits the third division of the fifth or inferior maxillary nerve, the small meningeal artery, and the small petrosal nerve.* On the outer side of the foramen ovale is the foramen spinosum, for the passage of the middle meningeal artery ; and on the inner side of the foramen ovale, the foramen lacerum inedium. The lower part of this aperture is filled up with cartilage in the recent state. The Vidian nerve and a meningeal branch from the ascending pharyngeal artery pierce this cartilage. On the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone is seen, from without inwards, the eminence caused by the projection of the superior semicircular canal; outside this a depression corresponding to the roof of the tympanum ; the groove leading to the hiatus Fallopii, for the transmission of the petrosal branch of the Vidian nerve and the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery ; beneath it, the smaller groove, for the passage of the lesser petrosal nerve ; and, near the apex of the bone, the depression for the Gasserian ganglion ; and the orifice of the carotid canal, for the passage of the internal carotid artery and carotid plexus of nerves. The Posterior Fossa, deeply concave, is the largest of the three, and situated on a lower level than either of the preceding. It is formed by the posterior third of the superior surface of the body of the sphenoid, by the occipital, the petrous and mastoid portions of the temporal, and the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone ; it is crossed by four sutures, the petro-occipital, the masto-occipital, the masto-parietal, and the basilar; and lodges the cerebellum, pons Varolii, and medulla oblongata. It is separated from the middle fossa in the median line by the dorsum ephippii, and on each side by the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This border serves for the attachment of the tentorium cerebelli, is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, and at its inner extremity presents a notch, upon which rests the fifth nerve. The circumference of the fossa is bounded posteriorly by the grooves for the lateral sinuses. In the centre of this fossa is the foramen magnum, bounded on either side by a rough tubercle, which gives attachment to the odontoid or check ligaments ; and a little above these are seen the internal openings of the anterior condyloid foramina, through which pass the hypoglossal nerve and a meningeal branch from the ascending pharyngeal artery. In front of the foramen magnum is a grooved surface, formed | by the basilar process of the occipital bone and by the posterior third of the superior I surface of the body of the sphenoid, which supports the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii, and articulates on each side with the petrous portion of the temporal | bone, forming the petro-occipital suture, the anterior half of which is grooved for j the inferior petrosal sinus, the posterior half being encroached upon by the foramen lacerum posterius, or jugular foramen. This foramen presents three compartments : , through the anterior, passes the inferior petrosal sinus ; through the posterior, the j lateral sinus and some meningeal branches from the occipital and ascending j pharyngeal arteries; and through the middle, the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo- j gastric and spinal accessory nerves. Above the jugular foramen is the internal \ aiiditory meatus, for the facial and auditory nerves and auditory artery; behind | and external to this is the slit-like opening leading into the aqugeductus vestibuli ; whilst between the two latter, and near the superior border of the petrous portion, is a small, triangular depression which lodges a process of the dura mater and occasionally transmits a small vein into the substance of the bone. Behind the : foramen magnum are the inferior occipital fossce, which lodge the hemispheres of the cerebellum, separated from one another by the internal occipital crest, which ; serves for the attachment of the falx cerebelli, and lodges the occipital sinus. The ; posterior fossse are surmounted, above, by the deep transverse grooves for the j lodgment of the lateral sinuses. These channels, in their passage outwards, | groove the occipital bone, the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, the mastoid J portion of the temporal, and the jugular process of the occipital, and terminate at ; * See footnote, p. 152.183 BASE OF THE SKULL the back part of the jugular foramen. Where this sinus grooves the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, the orifice of the mastoid foramen may be seen ; and, just previous to its termination, it has opening into it the jjosterior condyloid foramen. Neither foramen is constant. The External Surface of the Base of the Skull (fig. 173) is extremely irregular. It is bounded in front by the incisor teeth in the upper jaws; behind, by the superior curved lines of the occipital bone ; and laterally by the alveolar arch, the lower border of the malar bone, the zygoma, and an imaginary line, extending from the zygoma to the mastoid process and extremity of the superior curved line of the occiput. It is formed by the palate processes of the superior maxillary and palate bones, the vomer, the pterygoid processes, under surface of the great wing, spinous processes and part of the body of the sphenoid, the under surface of the squamous, mastoid, and petrous portions of the temporal, and the under surface of the occipital bone. The anterior part of the base of the skull is raised above the level of the rest of this surface (when the skull is turned over for the purpose of examination), surrounded by the alveolar process, which is thicker behind than in front, and excavated by sixteen depressions for lodging the teeth of the upper jaw, the cavities varying in depth and size according to the teeth they contain. Immediately behind the incisor teeth is the anterior j^alatine fossa. At the bottom of this fossa may usually be seen four apertures : two placed laterally, the foramina of Stenson, which open above, one in the floor of each nostril, and transmit the anterior branch of the posterior palatine vessels, and two in the median line in the intermaxillary suture, the foramina of Scarpa, one in front of the other, the anterior transmitting the left, and the posterior (the larger) the right, naso-palatine nerve. These two latter canals are sometimes wanting, or they may join to form a single one, or one of them may open into one of the lateral canals above referred to. The palatine vault is concave, uneven, perforated by numerous foramina, marked by depressions for the palatine glands, and crossed by a crucial suture, formed by the junction of the four bones of which it is composed. At the front part of this surface, a delicate linear suture may frequently be seen, marking off the pre-maxillary portion of the bone. One or two small foramina in the alveolar margin behind the incisor teeth, occasionally seen in the adult, almost constantly in young subjects, are called the incisive foramina; they transmit nerves and vessels I to the incisor teeth. At each posterior angle of the hard palate is the posterior palatine foramen, for the transmission of the posterior palatine vessels and large descending palatine nerve ; and running forwards and inwards from it a groove, for the same vessels and nerve. Behind the posterior palatine foramen is the tuberosity of the palate-hone, perforated by one or more accessory posterior palatine canals, and marked by the commencement of a ridge, which runs transversely inwards, and serves for the attachment of the tendinous expansion of the Tensor palati muscle. Projecting backwards from the centre of the posterior border of the hard palate is \the posterior nasal spine, tor the attachment of the Azygos uvulae. Behind and above the hard palate is the posterior aperture of the nares, divided into two parts by the vomer, bounded above by the body of the sphenoid, below by the horizontal jplate of the palate-bone, and laterally by the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid. Each aperture measures about an inch and a quarter in the vertical, and about half an inch in the transverse direction. At the base of the vomer may be seen the expanded alffi of this bone, receiving between them the rostrum of the sphenoid. Near the lateral margins of the vomer, at the root of the pterygoid processes, are |the pterygo-palatine canals. The pterygoid process, which bounds the posterior jnares on each side, presents near its base the pterygoid or Vidian canal, for the Vidian nerve and artery. Each process consists of two plates, which bifurcate at the extremity to receive the tuberosity of the palate-bone, and are separated behind fby the pterygoid fossa, which lodges the Internal pterygoid muscle. The internal [plate is long and narrow, presenting on the outer side of its base the scaplioid fossa, for the origin of the Tensor palati muscle, and at its extremity the hamular process, around which the tendon of this muscle turns. The external pterygoid plate isTHE SKELETON i84 broad, forms the inner boundary of the zygomatic fossa, and affords attachment, by its outer surface, to the External pterygoid muscle.

At the base of the external pterygoid plate is the foramen ovale; behind this, the foramen spinosum, and the prominent spinous process of the sphenoid, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and the Tensor palati muscle. External to the spinous process is the glenoid fossa, divided into two parts by the Glaserian fissure (page 145), the anterior portion concave, smooth, bounded in front by the eminentia articularis, and serving for the articulation of the condyle of the lower jaw ; the posterior portion rough, bounded behind by the tympanic plate, and ser\dng for the reception of part of the parotid gland. Emerging from between the laminae of the vaginal process of the tympanic plate is the styloid process ; and at the base of this process is the stylo-mastoid foramen, for the exit of the facial nerve, and entrance of the stylo-mastoid artery. External to the stylo-mastoid foramen is the auricular fisstire toT the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, bounded behind by the mastoid process. Upon the inner side of the mastoid process is a deep groove, the digastric fossa ; and a little more internally, the occipital groove, for the occipital artery. At the base of the internal pterygoid plate is a large and somewhat triangular aperture, the foramen lacerum medium, bounded in front by the great wing of the sphenoid, behind by the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and internally by the body of the sphenoid and basilar process of the occipital bone : it presents in front the posterior orifice of the Vidian canal; behind, the aperture of the carotid canal. The basilar surface of this opening is filled up in the recent state by a fibro-cartilaginous substance; across its upper or cerebral aspect pass the internal carotid artery and Vidian nerve. External to this aperture, the petro-splienoidal suture is observed, at the outer termination of which is seen the orifice of the canal for the Eustachian tube, and that for the Tensor tympani muscle. Behind this suture is seen the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, presenting, from within outwards, the quadrilateral, rough surface, part of which affords attachment to the Levator palati and Tensor tympani muscles ; external to this surface the orifices of the carotid canal and the aquae- ductus cochleffi, the former transmitting the internal carotid artery and the ascend- ing branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, the latter serving for the passage of a small artery and vein to the cochlea. Behind the carotid canal is a large aperture, the jugular fossa, formed in front by the petrous portion of the temporal, and behind by the occipital; it is generally larger on the right than on the left side, and is divided into three compartments by processes of dura mater. The anterior is for the passage of the inferior petrosal sinus ; the posterior for the lateral sinus and some meningeal branches from the occipital and ascending pharyngeal arteries ; the central one for the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves. On the ridge of bone dividing the carotid canal from the jugular fossa is the small foramen for the transmission of Jacobson's nerve; and on the outer wall of the jugular foramen, near the root of the styloid process, is the small aperture for the transmission of Arnold's nerve. Behind the basilar surface of the occipital bone is the foramen magnum, bounded on each side by the condyles, rough internally for the attachment of the check or odontoid ligaments, and presenting externally a rough surface, the jugular process, which serves for the attachment of the Rectus capitis lateralis muscle and the lateral occipito-atloid ligament. On either side of each condyle anteriorly is anterior condyloid fossa, perforated by the anterior condyloid foramen, for the passage of the hypoglossal nerve and a meningeal artery. Behind each condyle is the posterior condyloid fossa, perforated on one or both sides by the posterior condyloid foramina, for the transmission of a vein to the lateral sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is the external occipital crest, terminating above at the external occipital pjrotuherance whilst on each side are seen the superior and inferior curved lines ; these, as wellTHE SKELETON i86 as the surfaces of bone between them, are rough for the attachment of the muscles, which are enumerated on page 138. Lateral Kegion of the Sktll The Lateral Region of the Skull is of a somewhat triangular form, the base of the triangle being formed by a line extending from the external angular process of the frontal bone along the temporal ridge backwards to the outer extremity of the superior curved line of the occiput : and the sides by two lines, the one drawn downwards and backwards from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the angle of the lower jaw, the other from the angle of the jaw upwards and Fig. 174.—Side view of the skull.. backward to the outer extremity of the superior curved line. This region is divisible into three portions—temporal fossa, mastoid portion, and zygomatic fossa. The Temporal Fossa The Temporal Fossa is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, which extends from the external angular process of the frontal upwards and backwards across the frontal and parietal bones, curving downwards behind to terminate in the posterior root of the zygomatic process. This ridge is generally double, at all events in front, where it is most marked. In front, it is bounded by the frontal, malar, and great wing of the sphenoid : externally, by the zygomatic arch, formed conjointly by the malar and temporal bones ; below, it is separated from the187 THE ZYGOMATIC FOSSA zygomatic fossa by the pterygoid ridge, seen on the outer surface of the great wing of the sphenoid. This fossa is formed by five bones, part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal, squamous portion of the temporal, and malar bones, and is traversed by six sutures, part of the transverse facial, spheno- malar, coronal, spheno-parietal, squamo-parietal, and squamo-sphenoidal. The point where the coronal suture crosses the temporal ridge is sometimes named the stejjhanioii; and the region where the four bones, the parietal, the frontal, the squamous, and the greater wing of the sphenoid, meet, at the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, is named the i)tcrion. This point is about on a level with the external angular XDrocess of the frontal bone and about one and a half inch behind it. This fossa is deeply concave in front, convex behind, traversed by grooves which lodge branches of the deep temporal arteries, and filled by the Temporal muscles. The Mastoid Portion The Mastoid Portion of the side of the skull is bounded in front by the tubercle of the zygoma ; above, by a line which runs from the posterior root of the zygoma to the end of the masto-parietal suture ; behind and below by the masto-occipital suture. It is formed by the mastoid and part of the squamous and petrous por- tions of the temporal bone ; its surface is convex and rough for the attachment of muscles, and presents, from behind forwards, the mastoid foramen, the mastoid process, the external auditory meatus, surrounded by the auditory process, and, most anteriorly, the temporo-maxillary articulation. The Zygomatic Fossa The Zygomatic Fossa is an irregularly shaped cavity, situated below and on the inner side of the zygoma ; bounded, in front, by the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone and the ridge Avhich descends from its malar process; behind, by the posterior border of the pterygoid process and the eminentia articularis ; above, by the pterygoid ridge on the outer surface of the great wing of the sphenoid, and the under part of the squamous portion of the temporal; below, by the alveolar border of the superior maxilla; internally, by the external pterygoid plate; and externally, by the zygomatic arch and ramus of the lower jaw. It contains the lower part of the Temporal, the External and Internal pterygoid muscles, the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve and their branches. At its upper and inner part may be observed two fissures, the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary. The Spheno-maxillary Fissure, horizontal in direction, opens into the outer and back part of the orbit. It is formed above by the lower border of the orbital surface of the great wing of the sphenoid; below, by the external border of the orbital surface of the superior maxilla and a small part of the palate-bone; externally, by a small part of the malar bone : * internally, it joins at right angles with the pterygo-maxillary fissure. This fissure opens a communication from the orbit into three fossae—the temporal, zygomatic, and spheno-maxillary; it transmits the superior maxillary nerve and its orbital branch, the infra-orbital vessels, and ascending branches from the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. The Pterygo-maxillary Fissure is vertical, and descends at right angles from the inner extremity of the preceding; it is a V-shaped interval, formed by the divergence of the superior maxillary bone from the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. It serves to connect the spheno-maxillary fossa with the zygomatic fossa, and transmits branches of the internal maxillary artery. It forms the entrance from the zygomatic fossa to the spheno-maxillary fossa. * Occasionally the superior maxillary bone and the sphenoid articulate with each other at the anterior extremity of this fissure ; the malar is then excluded from entering into its formation.i88 THE SKELETON The Spheno-maxillaky Fossa The Spheno-maxillary Fossa is a small, triangular space situated at the angle of junction of the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxillary fissures, and placed beneath the apex of the orbit. It is formed above by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid and by the orbital process of the palate-bone ; in front, by the superior maxillary bone; behind, by the anterior surface of the base of the pterygoid process and lower part of the anterior surface of the great wing of the sphenoid ; internally, by the vertical plate of the palate. This fossa has three fissures terminating in it, the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary, and pterygo-maxillary ; it communicates with three fossae, the orbital, nasal, and zygomatic, and with the cavity of the cranium, and has opening into it five foramina. Of these there are three on the posterior wall : the foramen rotundum above ; below, and internal to this, the Vidian; and still more inferiorly and internally, the pterygo-palatine. On the inner wall is the spheno-palatine foramen by which the spheno-maxillary communicates with the nasal fossa ; and below is the superior orifice of the posterior palatine canal, besides occasionally the orifices of the accessory posterior palatine canals. The fossa contains the superior maxillary nerve and Meckel's ganglion, and the termination of the internal maxillary artery. Anteeior Kegion of the Skull The Anterior Region of the Skull, which forms the face, is of an oval form, presents an irregular surface, and is excavated for the reception of two of the organs of sense, the eye and the nose. It is bounded above by the glabella and margins of the orbit; below, by the prominence of the chin ; on each side, by the malar bone, and anterior margin of the ramus of the jaw. In the median line are seen from above downwards the glabella, and diverging from it are the superciliary ridges, which indicate the situation of the frontal sinuses and support the eyebrows. Beneath the glabella is the fronto-nasal suture, the mid-point of which is termed the nasion, and below this is the arch of the nose, formed by the nasal bones, and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary. The nasal arch is convex from side to side, concave from above downAvards, presenting in the median line the inter- nasal suture formed between the nasal bones, laterally the naso-maxillary suture formed between the nasal bone and the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Below the nose is seen the opening of the anterior nares, which is heart- shaped, with the narrow end upwards, and presents laterally the thin, sharp margins serving for the attachment of the lateral cartilages of the nose, and in the middle line below, a prominent process, the anterior nasal spine, bounded by two deep notches. Below this is the intermaxillary suture, and on each side of it the incisive fossa. Beneath this fossa are the alveolar] processes of the upper and lower jaws, containing the incisor teeth, and at the lower part of the median line, the symphysis of the chin, the mental process, with its two mental tubercles, separated by a median groove, and the incisive fossa of the lower jaw. On each side, proceeding from above downwards, is the supra-orbital ridge, terminating externally in the external angular process at its junction with the malar, and internally in the internal angular process ; tow^ards the inner third of this ridge is the supra-orbital notch ox foramen, for the passage of the supra-orbital vessels and nerve, and at its inner side a slight depression for the attachment of the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle. Beneath the supra-orbital ridge is the opening of the orbit, bounded externally by the orbital ridge of the malar bone ; below, by the orbital ridge formed by the malar, superior maxillary, and lachrymal bones ; internally, by the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and the internal angular process of the frontal bone. On the outer side of the orbit is the quadri- lateral anterior surface of the malar bone, perforated by one or two small malar foramina. Below the inferior margin of the orbit is the infra-orbital foramen, the termination of the infra-orbital canal, and beneath this the canine fossa, which givesTHE ORBITS attachment to the Levator angiih oris ; bounded below by the alveolar processes, containing the teeth of the upper and lower jaw. Beneath the alveolar arch of the lower jaw is the mental foramen for the passage of the mental vessels and nerve, the external oblique line, and at the lower border of the bone, at the point of junction of the body with the ramus, a shalloAv groove for the passage of the facial artery. The Debits The Orbits (fig. 175) are two quadrilateral pyramidal cavities, situated at the upper and anterior part of the face, their bases being directed forwards and outwards, and their apices backwards and inwards, so that the axes of the two, if continued backwards, would meet over the body of the sphenoid bone. Each orbit is formed of seven bones, the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, superior maxillary, malar, lachrymal, and palate; but three of these, the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid, enter into the formation of botJi orbits, so that the two cavities are formed of eleven bones only. Each cavity presents for examination a roof, a floor, an inner and an outer wall, four angles, a circumference or base, and an apex. The roof is concave, directed downwards and forwards, and formed in front by the orbital plate of the frontal; behind by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. This surface presents internally the depression for the cartilaginous pulley of the Superior oblique muscle ; externally, the depression for the lachrymal gland ; and posteriorly, the suture connecting the frontal and lesser wing of the sphenoid.THE SKELETON 190 The floor is nearly flat, and of less extent than the roof; it is formed chiefly by the orbital process of the superior maxillary ; in front, to a small extent, by the orbital process of the malar, and behind, by the superior surface of the orbital process of the palate. This surface presents at its anterior and internal part, just external to the lachrymal groove, a depression for the attachment of the Inferior oblique muscle; externally, the suture between the malar and superior maxillary bones ; near its middle, the infra-orbital groove ; and posteriorly, the suture between the maxillary and palate bones. The inner wall is flattened, and formed from before backwards by the nasal process of the superior maxillary, the lachrymal, os planum of the ethmoid, and a small part of the body of the sphenoid. This surface presents the lachrymal groove, and crest of the lachrymal bone, and the sutures connecting the lachrymal with the superior maxillary, the ethmoid with the lachrymal in front, and the ethmoid with the sphenoid behind. The outer wall is formed in front by the orbital process of the malar bone ; behind, by the orbital surface of the sphenoid. On it are seen the orifices of one or two malar canals, and the suture connecting the sphenoid and malar bones. Angles.—The suj^erior external angle is formed by the junction of the upper and outer walls ; it presents, from before backwards, the suture connecting the frontal with the malar in front, and with the great wing of the sphenoid behind ; quite posteriorly is the foramen lacerum anterius, or sphenoidal fissure, which transmits the third, the fourth, the three branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth, the sixth nerve, some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery, a recurrent branch from the lachrymal artery to the dura mater, and the ophthalmic vein. The superior internal angle is formed by the junction of the upper and inner wall, and presents the suture connecting the frontal bone with the lachrymal in front, and wdth the ethmoid behind. The point of junction of these three sutures has been named the dacryon. This angle presents two foramina, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, the former transmitting the anterior ethmoidal vessels and nasal nerve, the latter the posterior ethmoidal vessels. The inferior external angle, formed by the junction of the outer wall and floor, presents the spheno-maxillary fissure, which transmits the superior maxillary nerve and its orbital branches, the infra-orbital vessels, and the ascending branches from the spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. The inferior internal angle is formed by the union of the lachrymal and os planum of the ethmoid, with the superior maxillary and palate bones. The circumference, or base, of the orbit, quadrilateral in form, is bounded above by the supra-orbital ridge ; below, by the anterior border of the orbital plate of the malar, superior maxillary, and lachrymal bones ; externally, by the external angular process of the frontal and the malar bones ; internally, by the internal angular process of the frontal, and the nasal process of the superior maxillary. The circumference is marked by three sutures, the fronto-maxillary internally, the fronto-malar externally, and the malo-maxillary below; it contributes to the formation of the lachrymal groove, and presents, above, the supra-orbital notch (or foramen), for the passage of the supra-orbital vessels and nerve. The apex, situated at the back of the orbit, corresponds to the optic foramen, a short, circular canal, which transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. It will thus be seen that there are nine openings communicating with each orbit—viz. the optic foramen, foramen lacerum anterius, spheno-maxillary fissure, supra-orbital foramen, infra-orbital canal, anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, malar foramina, and canal for the nasal duct. The Nasal Foss^ The Nasal Fossae are two large, irregular cavities, situated on either side of the middle line of the face, extending from the base of the cranium to the roof of the mouth, and separated from each other by a thin vertical septum. They communicate by two large apertures, the anterior nares, with the front of the face ; and by the191 NASAL FOSS^ two posterior nares Avith the pharynx behind. These fossae are much narrower above than below, and in the middle than at the anterior or posterior openings : their depth, which is considerable, is much greater in the middle than at either extremity. Each nasal fossa communicates with four sinuses, the frontal above, the sphenoidal behind, and the maxillary and ethmoidal on the outer wall. Each fossa also communicates with four cavities : with the orbit by the lachrymal groove, with the mouth by the anterior palatine canal, with the cranium by the olfactory foramina, and with the spheno-maxillary fossa by the spheno-palatine foramen; and they occasionally communicate with each other by an aperture in the septum. The bones entering into their formation are fourteen in number : three of the cranium, the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid, and all the bones of the Fig. 176.—Eoof, floor, and outer wall of left nasal fossa. face, excepting the malar and lower jaw. Each cavity is bounded by a roof, a floor, an inner and an outer wall. The upper wall, or roof (fig. 176), is long, narrow, and concave from before backwards ; it is formed in front by the nasal bones and nasal spine of the frontal, which are directed downwards and forwards; in the middle, by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, which is horizontal; and behind, by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid, and sphenoidal turbinated bones, which are directed downwards and backwards. This surface presents, from before backwards, the internal aspect of the nasal bones ; on their outer side, the suture formed between the nasal bone and the nasal process of the superior maxillary ; on their inner side, the elevated crest which receives the nasal spine of the frontal and the per- pendicular plate of the ethmoid, and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side ; whilst the surface of the bones is perforated by a few small vascular apertures, and presents the longitudinal groove for the nasal nerve : further back is the transverse suture, connecting the frontal with the nasal in front, and the ethmoid behind, the olfactory foramina and nasal slit on the under surface of the cribriform plate, and the suture between it and the sphenoid behind : quite posteriorly are192 THE SKELETON seen the sphenoidal turbmated bones, the orifices of the sphenoidal sinuses, and the articulation of the alfe of the vomer with the under surface of the body of the sphenoid. The floor is flattened from before backwards, concave from side to side, and wider in the middle than at either extremity. It is formed in front by the palate process of the superior maxillary; behind, by the palate process of the palate-bone. This surface presents, from before backwards, the anterior nasal spine; behind this, the upper orifices of the anterior palatine canal; internally, the elevated crest which articulates with the vomer; and behind, the suture between the palate and superior maxillary bones, and the posterior nasal spine. The inner wall, or septum (fig. 177), is a thin vertical partition, which separates the nasal fossae from one another ; it is occasionally perforated, so that the fossaB communicate, and it is frequently deflected considerably to one side.* It is formed. Fig. 177.—Imier wall of nasal fossae, or septmn of nose. in front, by the crest of the nasal bones and nasal spine of the frontal; in the middle, by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid ; behind, by the vomer and rostrum of the sphenoid ; below, by the crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. It presents, in front, a large, triangular notch, which receives the triangular cartilage of the nose; and behind, the guttural edge of the vomer. Its surface is marked by numerous vascular and nervous canals and the groove for the naso- palatine nerve, and is traversed by sutures connecting the bones of which it is formed. The outer wall (fig. 176) is formed, in front, by the nasal process of the superior maxillary and lachrymal bones; in the middle, by the ethmoid and inner surface of the superior maxillary and inferior turbinated bones ; behind, by the vertical plate of the palate-bone, and the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. This surface presents three irregular longitudinal passages, or meatuses, formed between three horizontal plates of bone that spring from it; they are termed the superior, middle, and inferior meatuses of the nose. The suijcrior meatus, the * See footnote, p. 156.193 SURFACE FORM OF SKULL smallest of the three, is situated at the upper and back part of each nasal fossa, occupying the posterior third of the outer wall. It is situated between the superior and middle turbinated bones, and has opening into it two foramina, the spheiio- vcdatine at the back of its outer wall, and the posterior ethmoidal cells at the front part of the outer wall. The opening of the sphenoidal sinuses is usually at the upper and back part of the nasal fossje immediately behind the superior turbinated bone. The middle meatus is situated between the middle and inferior turbinated bones, and occupies the posterior two-thirds of the outer wall of the nasal fossa. It presents two apertures. In front is the orifice of the infundihulum, by which the middle meatus communicates with the anterior ethmoidal cells, and through these with the frontal sinuses. At the centre of the outer wall is the orifice of the antrum, which varies somewhat as to its exact position in different skulls. The in ferior meatus, the largest of the three, is the space between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It extends along the entire length of the outer wall of the nose, is broader in front than behind, and presents anteriorly the lower orifice of tlic canal for the nasal duct. The anterior nares present a heart-shaped or pyriform opening, whose long axis is vertical, and narrow extremity upwards. This opening in the recent state is much contracted by the cartilages of the nose. It is bounded above by the inferior border of the nasal bone; laterally by the thin, sharp margin which separates the facial from the nasal surface of the superior maxillary bone; and below by the same border, where it slopes inwards to join its fellow of the opposite side at the anterior nasal spine. The posterior nares are the two posterior oval openings of the nasal foss*, by which they communicate with the upper part of the pharynx. They are situated immediately in front of the basilar process, and are bounded above by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid ; below by the posterior border of the horizontal plate of the palate-bone ; externally by the internal surface of the internal pterygoid plate ; and internally, in the middle line, they are separated from each other by the guttural border of the Vomer. Surface Form.—-The various bony prominences or landmarks which are to be easily felt and recognised in the head and face, and which afford the means of mapping out the important structures comprised in this region, are as follow:— 1. Supra-orbital arch. 8. Parietal eminences. 2. Internal angular process. 9. Temporal ridge. 3. External angular process. 10. Frontal eminences. 4. Zygomatic arch. 11. Superciliary ridges. 5. Mastoid process. 12. Nasal bones. 6. External occipital protuberance. 13. Lower margin of orbit. 7. Superior curved line of occipital bone. 14. Lower jaw. I. The supra-orbital arches are to be felt throughout their entire extent, covered by the eyebrows. They form the upper boundary of the circumference or base of the orbit and separate the face from the forehead. They are strong and arched, and terminate internally on each side of the root of the nose, in the internal angular process, which articulates with the lachrymal bone. Externally they terminate in the external angular jjrocess which articulates with the malar bone. This arched ridge is sharper and more defined in its outer than in its inner half, and forms an overhanging process which protects and shields the lachrymal gland. It thus protects the eye in its most exposed situation and in the direction from which blows are more likely to descend. The supra-orbital arch varies in prominence in different individuals. It is more marked in the male than in the female, and in some races of mankind than others. In the less civilised races, as the forehead recedes backwards, the supra-orbital arch becomes more prominent and approaches more to the characters of the monkey tribe, in which the supra-orbital arches are very largely developed and acquire additional prominence from the oblique direction of the frontal bone. 2. The internal angular j^rocess is scarcely to be felt. Its position is indicated by the angle formedby the supra-orbital arch with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone and the lachrymal bone at the inner side of the orbit. IBetween the mternal angular processes of the two sides is a broad surface which assists in forming the root of the nose, and immediately above this a broad, smooth, somewhat triangular surface, the glabella, situated between the superciliary ridges. 3. The external angular process is much more strongly marked than the internal, and is plainly to be felt. It is formed by the junction or conifliience of the supra-orbital and temporal ridges, and, articulating with the malar bone, it serves to a very considerable extent to support the bones of the face. In carnivorous animals the 0194 THE SKELETON external angular process does not articulate with the malar, and therefore this lateral support to the bones of the face is not i)resent. 4. The zygomatic arch is plainly to be felt throughout its entire length, being situated almost innnediately imder the skin/ It is formed by the malar Innie and the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. At its anterior extremity, where it is formed by the malar bone, it is broad and forms the prominence of the cheek ; the posterior part is narrower, and terminates just in front and a little above the tragus of the external ear. The lower border is more plainly to be felt than the ui)per, in consequence of the dense temporal fascia being attached to the upper border, wliich somewhat obscures its outline. Its shape differs xevy nnich in indi^■iduals and in different races of mankind. In the most degi-aded type of skull—as, for instance, in the skull of the negro of the Guinea Coast—the malar bones project forwards and not outwards, and the zygoma at its posterior extremity extends further outwards before it is twisted on itself to be prolonged forwards. This makes the zygomatic arch stand out in bold relief, and affords greater space for the Temporal nniscle. In skulls which have a more pyramidal shape, as in the Esquimaux or Greenlandcr, the malar bones do not project forwards and downwards under the eyes, as in the preceding form, but take a direction outwards, forming with the zygoma a large, rounded sweep or segment of a circle. Thus it happens that if two lines are drawn from the zygomatic arches, touching the temporal ridges, they meet over the top of the head, instead of being parallel, or nearly so, as in the European skull, in which the zygomatic arches are not nearly so prominent. This gives to the fixce a more or less oval type. 5. Behind the ear is the mastoid j^ortion of the temx)07'al hone, plainly to be felt, and terminating below in a nipple-shaped process. Its anterior border can be traced immediately behind the concha, and its apex is on about a level with the lobule of the ear. It is rudimentary in infancy, but gradually develops in childhood, and is more marked in the negro than in the European. 6. The ertcrnal occijntaljJTotuhcrance is always plainly to be felt just at the level where the skin of the neck joins that of the head. At this point the skull is thick for the purposes of safety, wdiile radiating from it are numerous curved arches or buttresses of bone which give to this portion of the skull further security. 7. Kunning outwards on either side from the external occipital protu- berance is an arched ridge of bone, which can be more or less plainly perceived. This is the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and giA es attachment to some of the muscles whicli keep the head erect on the spine; accordingly, we find it more developed in the negro tribes, in whom the jaws are much more massive, and therefore require stronger muscles to prevent their extra weight carrying the head forwards. Below this line the surface of bone at the back of the head is obscured b}' the overlying muscles. Above it, the vault of the cranium is thinly covered with soft structures, so that the form of this part of the head is almost exactly that of the upper portion of the occipital, the parietal, and the frontal bones themselves ; and, in bald persons, even the lines of junction of the bones, especially the junction of the occipital and parietal at the lambdoid suture, may be defined as a slight depression, caused by the thickening of the borders of the bones in this situation. 8. In the line of the greatest transverse diameter of the head, on each side (^f the middle line, are generally to be foimd the _2JrtriffaZ eminences ; though sometimes these eminences are not situated at the point of the greatest transverse diameter, which is at some other prominent part of the parietal region. They denote the point where ossification of the bone began. They are much more prominent and well-marked in early life, in consequence of the sharper curve of the bone at this period, so that it describes the segment of a smaller circle. Later in life, as the bone grows, the curve spreads out and forms the segment of a larger circle, so tluit the eminence becomes less distinguishable. In consequence of this sharp curve of the bone in early life, the whole of the vault of the skull has a squarer shape than it has in later life, and this appearance may persist in some rickety skulls. The eminence is more apparent in the negi'o's skull than in that of the European. This is due to greater flattening of the temporal fossa in the former skull to accommodate the larger Temporal muscle which exists in these races. The parietal eminence is particularly exposed to injury from blows or falls on the head, but fracture is to a certain extent prevented by the shape of the bone, which forms an arch, so that the force of the blow is diffused over the bone in e\ ery direction. 9. At the side of the head m&y be felt the temj^oral ridge. Commencing at the external angular process, it may be felt as a cm'ved ridge, passing upwards and thei) curving backwards, on the fi'ontal bone, separating the forehead from the temporal fossa. It ma\' then be traced, passing backwards in a curved direction, over the parietal bone, and, though less marked, still generally to be recognised. Finally, the ridge curves downwards, and terminates in the posterior root of the z^^goma, which separates the squamous from the subcutaneous mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Mr. Victor Horsley has recently shown, in an article on the ' Topography of the Cerebral Cortex,' that the second temporal ridge (see page 138) can be made out on the living body. 10. The frontal eminences vary a good deal in different individuals, being considerably more prominent in some than in others, and they are often not synnnetrical on the two sides of the body, the one being much more pronounced than the other. This is often especially noticeable in the skull of the young child or infant, and becomes less marked as age advances. The prominence of the frontal eminences depends more upon the general shape of the whole bone than upon the size of the protuberances themselves. As the skull is more highly developed in consequence of increased intellectual195 SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF SKULL capacity, so the frontal bone becomes more upright, and the frontal eminences stand ont in bolder relief. Thus the}' may be considered as affording, to a certain extent, an indication of the development of the hemispheres of the brain beneath, and of the mental powers of the individual. They are not so much exposed to injury as the parietal eminences. In falls forward the upper extremities are involuntarily thrown out, and break the force of the fall, and thus shield the frontal bone from injury. 11. Below the frontal eminences on the forehead are the suijerciliary ridges, which denote the position of the frontal sinuses and vary according to the size of the sinuses in different individuals, being, as a rule, small in the female, absent in children, and sometimes unusually prominent in the male, when the frontal sinuses are largely developed. They commence on either side of the glabella, and at hrst present a rounded form, which gradually fades away at their outer ends. 12. The nasal hones form the prominence of the nose. They vary much in size and shape, and to them is due the varieties in the contour of this organ and much of the character of the face. Thus, in the Mongolian or Ethiopian they are flat, broad and thick at their base, giving to these tribes the flattened nose by which they are characterised, and differing very decidedly from the Caucasian, in whom the nose, owing to the shape of the nasal bones, is narrow, elevated at the bridge, and elongated downwards. Below, the nasal bones are thin and connected with the cartilages of the nose, and the angle or arch formed by their union serves to throw out the bridge of the nose, and is much more marked in some individuals than others. 13. The lower margin of the orhit, formed by the superior maxillary bone and the malar bone, is plainly to be felt throughout its entire length. It is continuous internally with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, which forms the inner boundary of the orbit. At the point of junction of the lower margin of the orbit with the nasal process is to be felt a little tubercle of bone, which can be plainly perceived by running the finger along the bone in this situation. This tubercle serves as a guide to the position of the lachrymal sac, which is situated above and behind it. 14. The outline of the loiver jaiu is to be felt throughout its entire length. Just in front of the tragus of the external ear, and below the zygomatic arch, the condyle can be made out. ^Yllen the mouth is opened, this prominence of bone can be perceived advancing out of the glenoid fossa on to the eminentia articularis, and receding again when the mouth is closed. From the condyle the posterior border of the ramus can be felt extending down to the angle. A line drawn from the condyle to the angle would indicate the exact position of this border. From the angle to the symphysis of the chin, the lower, rounded border of the body of the bone is plainly to be felt. At the point of junction of the two halves of the bone is a well-marked, triangular eminence, the 7nental xwocess, Avhich forms the prominence of the chin. Surgical Anatomy.—An arrest in the ossifying process may give rise to deficiencies or gaps ; or to fissures, which are of importance in a medico-legal point of views as they are liable to be mistaken for fractures. The fissures generally extend from the margin towards the centre of the bone, but gaps may be found in the middle, as well as at the edges. In course of time they may become covered with a thin lamina of bone. Occasionally a protrusion of the brain or its membranes may take place through one of these gaps in an imperfectly developed skull. "When the protrusion consists of membranes only, and is filled with cerebro-spinal fluid, it is called a meningocele ; when the protrusion consists of brain as well as membranes, it is termed an enceplialocele ; and when the protruded brain is a prolongation from one of the ventricles, and is distended by a collec- tion of fluid from an accumulation in the ventricle, it is termed an hydrencej^halocele. This latter condition it frequently found at the root of the nose, where a protrusion of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle takes place through a deficiency of the fronto-nasal suture. These malformations are usually found in the middle line, and most frequently at the back of the head, the protrusion taking place through the fissures which separate the four centres of ossification from which the tabular portion is originally developed (see page 138). They most frequently occur through the upper part of the vertical fissure, which is the last to ossify, but not uncommonly through the lower part, when the foramen magmmi may be incomplete. More rarely these protrusions have been met with in other situations than those two above mentioned, both through normal fissures, as the sagittal, lambdoid, and other sutures, and also through abnormal gaps and deficiencies at the sides, and even at the base of the skull. Fractures of the skull may be divided into those of the vault and those of the base. Fractures of the vault are usually produced by direct violence. This portion of the skull varies in thickness and strength in different individuals, but, as a rule, is sufficiently strong to resist a \ery considerable amomit of violence without being fractured. This is due to several causes:—the rounded shape of the head and its construction of a number of secondary elastic arches, each made up of a single bone; the fact that it consists of a number of bones, united, at all events in early life, by a sutural ligament, which acts as a sort of buffer and interrupts the continuity of any violence applied to the skull; the presence of arches or ridges, both on the inside and outside of the skull, which materially strengthen it ; and the mobility of the head upon the spine which further enables it to withstand A iolence. The elasticity of the bones of the head is especially marked in the skull of the child, and this fact, together with the wide separation of the individual bones fi^om each other, and the interposition between tliem of other softer structures, renders O 2THE SKELETON fracture of the bones of the head a very uncommon event in infants and quite young children; as age advances, and the bones become joined, fracture is more common, though still less liable to occur than in the adult. Fractures of the vault may, and gene- rally do, involve the whole thickness of the bone ; but sometimes one table may be fractured without any corresponding injury to the other. Thus, the outer table of the skull may be splintered and driven into the diploe, or in the frontal or mastoid regions into the frontal or mastoid cells, without any injury to the internal table. And on the other hand the internal table has been fractured, and portions of it depressed and driven inwards without an}- fracture of the outer table. As a rule, in fractures of the skull, the inner table is more splintered and comminuted than the outer, and this is due to several causes. It is thinner and more brittle; the force of the violence as it passes inwards becomes broken up, and is more diffused by the time it reaches the inner table ; the bone being in the form of an arch bends as a whole and spreads out, and thus presses the particles together on the convex surface of the arch, i.e. the outer table, and forces them asunder on the concave surface or inner table; and, lastly, there is nothing firm under the inner table to support it and oppose the force. Fractures of the vault may be simple fissures, or starred and comminuted fractures, and these may be de})ressed or elevated. These latter cases of fracture with elevation of the fractured portion are uncommon, and can only be produced by direct wound. In comminuted fracture, a por- tion of the skull is broken into several pieces, the lines of fracture radiating from a centre where the chief impact of the blow was felt; if depressed, a fissure circumscribes the radiating lines, enclosing a portion of skull. If this area is circular it is termed a ' pond ' fracture, and would in all probability have been caused by a round instrument, as a life preserver or hannner ; if elliptical in shape it is termed a 'gutter fracture,' and would owe its shape to the instrument which had produced it, as a poker. Fractures of the base are most frequently produced by the extension of a fissure from the vault, as in falls on the head, where the fissure starts from the part of the vault which first struck the ground. Sometimes, however, they are caused by direct violence, when foreign bodies have been forced through the thin roof of the orbit, through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid from being thrust up the nose, or through the roof of the pharynx. Other cases of fracture of the base occur from indirect violence, as in fracture of the occipital bone from impaction of the spinal column against its condyles in falls on the buttocks, knees, or feet, or in cases where the glenoid cavity has been fi-actured by the violent impact of the condyle of the lower jaw against it from blows on the chin. The most common place for fracture of the base to occur is through the middle fossa, and here the fissure usually takes a fairly definite course. Starting from the point struck, which is generally somewhere in the neighbourhood of the parietal eminence, it runs downwards through the parietal and squamous portion of the temporal bone and across the petrous portion of this bone, frequently traversing and implicating the internal auditory meatus, to the middle lacerated foramen. From this it may j)ass across the body of the sj)henoid, through the pituitary fossa to the middle lacerated foramen of the other side, and may indeed travel round the whole cranium, so as to completely separate the anterior from the posterior part. The com^se of the fracture should be borne in mind, as it explains the symptoms to which fracture in this region may give rise : thus, if the fissure pass across the internal auditory meatus, injury to the facial and auditory nerves may result, with consequent facial paralysis and deafness ; or the tubular pro- longation of the arachnoid around these nerN es in the meatus may be torn and thus permit of the escape of the cerebro-spinal fiuid should there be a connnunication between the internal ear and the tympanum and the membrana tympani be ruptured, as is frequently the case : again, if the fissure passes across the pituitary fossa and the muco- periosteum covering the imder surface of the body of the sphenoid is torn, blood will find its way into the pharynx and be swallowed, and after a time vomiting of blood will result. Fractures of the anterior fossa, involving the bones forming the roof of the orbit and nasal fossa, are generally the results of blows on the forehead ; but fracture of the cribriform ])late of the ethmoid may be a complication of fracture of the nasal bone. When the fracture implicates the roof of the orbit, the blood finds its way into this cavity and, travelling forwards, appears as a subconjunctival ecchymosis. If the roof of the nasal fossa be fractured, the blood escapes fi'om the nose. In rare cases there may be also escape of cerebro-spinal fiuid from the nose, where the dura mater and arachnoid have l)een torn. In fractures of the posterior fossa, extravasation of blood may appear at the nape of the neck. The bones of the skull being subcutaneous are frequently the seat of nodes, and not uncommonly necrosis results from this cause, as well as from injury. Necrosis may involve the entire thickness of the skull, but is usually confined to the external table. Necrosis of the internal table alone is rarely met with. The bones of the skull are also frequently the seat of sarcomatous tumour. The skull in rickets is peculiar : the forehead is high, square, and projecting; and the antero-posterior diameter of the skull is long, in relation to the transverse diameter. The bones of the face are small and ill-developed, and this gives the appearance of a larger head than actually' exists. The bones of the head are often thick, especially in the neighbourhood of the sutures, and the anterior fontanelle is late in closing, sometimesSUEGICAL ANATOMY OF BONES OF FACE 197 remaining unclosed till the fom'th year. The condition of cranio-tahes has by some been also believed to be the result of rickets ; by others is believed to be due to inherited syphilis. In these cases the bone undergoes atrophic changes in patches, so that it becomes gi'eatly thinned in places, generally where there is pressure, as from the pillow or nurse's arm. It is, therefore, usually met with in the parietal bone and vertical plate of the occipital bone. In congenital syphilis deposits of porous bone are often found at the angles of the parietal bones, and two halves of the frontal bone which bound the anterior fontanelle. These deposits are separated by the coronal and sagittal sutm^es, and give to the skull an appearance like a ' hot cross bun.' They are known as Parrot's nodes, and such a skull has received the name of natiform, from its fancied resemblance to the buttocks. In connection with the bones of the face a common malformation is cleft joalate, owing to the non-union of the palatal processes of the maxillary or pre-oral arch (see page 88). This cleft may involve the whole or only a portion of the hard palate, and usually involves the soft palate also. The cleft is in the middle line, except it involves the alveolus in front, when it follows the suture between the main portion of the bone and the pre-maxillary bone. Sometimes the cleft runs on either side of the pre-maxillary bone, so that this bone is quite isolated from the maxillary bones and hangs from the end of the vomer. The malformation is usually associated with hare-lip, which, when single, is almost always on one side, corresponding to the position of the suture between the lateral incisor and canine tooth. Some few cases of median hare-lip have been described. In double hare-lip there is a cleft on each side of the middle line. The bones of the face are sometimes fractured as the result of direct violence. The two most commonly broken are the nasal bone and the inferior maxilla, and of these, the latter is by far the most frequently fractured of all the bones of the face. Fracture of the nasal bone is for the most part transverse, and takes place about half an inch from the free margin. The broken portion may be displaced backwards or more generally to one side by the force which produced the lesion, as there are no muscles here which can cause displace- ment. The malar bone is probably never broken alone, that is to say, imconnected with a fracture of the other bones of the face. The zygomatic arch is occasionally fractured, and when this occurs from direct violence, as is usually the case, the fragments may be displaced inwards. This lesion is often attended with great difficulty or even inability to open and shut the mouth, and this has been stated to be due to the depressed fragments perforating the temporal muscle, but would appear rather to be caused by the injury done to the bony origin of the masseter muscle. Fractures of the su^Jerior maxilla may vary much in degree, from the chipping off of a portion of the alveolar arch, a frequent accident when the old ' key' instrument was used for the extraction of teeth, to an extensive comminution of the whole bone from severe violence, as the kick of a horse. The most common situation for a fracture of the inferior maxillary bone is in the neighbourhood of the canine tooth, as at this spot the jaw is weakened by the deep socket for the fang of this tooth ; it is next most frequently fractured at the angle; then at the symphysis, and finally the neck of the condyle or the coronoid process may be broken. Occasionally a double fracture may occur, one in either half of the bone. The fractures are usually compound, from laceration of the mucous membrane covering the gums. The dis- placement is mainly the result of the same violence as produced the injury, but may be further increased by the action of the muscles passing from the neighbourhood of the symphysis to the hyoid bone. The superior and inferior maxillary bones are both of them frequently the seat of necrosis ; though the disease affects the lower much more frequently than the upper jaw, probably on account of the greater supply of blood to the latter. It may be the result of periostitis, from tooth irritation, injury, or the action of some specific poison, as syphilis, or from salivation by mercury ; it not unfrequently occurs in children after attacks of the exanthematous fevers, and a special form occurs from the action of the fumes of phosphorus in persons engaged in match-making. Tumours attack the jaw-bones not unfrequently, and these may be either innocent or malignant : in the upper jaw cysts may occur in the antrum, constituting the so-called dropsy of the antrum ; or, again, cysts may form in either jaw in connection with the teeth : either cj^sts connected with the roots of fully developed teeth, the ' dental cyst'; or cysts connected with imperfectly developed teeth, the ' dentigerous cyst.' Solid inno- cent tumours include the fibroma, the chondroma, and the osteoma. Of malignant tumours there are two classes, the sarcomata and the epithelioma. The sarcoma are of various kinds, the spindle-celled and round-celled of a very malignant character, and the myeloid sarcoma principally affecting the alveolar margin of the bone. Of the epitheliomata we find the squamous variety spreading to the bone from the palate or gum, and the c^dindrical epithelioma originating in the antrum or nasal fossa?. Both superior and inferior maxillary bones occasionally require removal for tumours and in some other conditions. The upper jaw is removed by an incision from the inner canthus of the eye, along the side of the nose, round the ala, and down the middle line of the upper lip. A second incision is carried outw ards from tlio inner canthus of the eye along the lower margin of the orbit as far as the prominence of the malar bone. The flap thus formed is reflected outwards and the surface of the bone exposed. The connections of theTHE SKELETON bone to the other bones of the face are then divided with a narrow saw. They are (i) the junction with the malar bone, passing into the spheno-maxillary fissiu-e: (2) the nasal process ; a small portion of its upper extremity, connected with the nasal bone in front, the lachrymal bone behind, and the frontal bone above, being left: (3) the connection with the bone on the opposite side and the palate in the roof of the mouth. The bone is now firmly grasped with lion-forceps, and by means of a rocking movement upwards and downwards the remaining attachments of the orbital plate wdth the ethmoid, and of the back of the bone with the palate, broken through. The soft palate is first separated from the hard with a scalpel and is not removed. Occasionally in removing the upper jaw, it will be found that the orbital jjlate can be spared, and this should always be done if possible. A horizontal saw-cut is to be made just below the infra-orbital foramen, and the bone cut through with a chisel and mallet. Removal of one half of the lower jaw is sometimes required. If possible, the section of the bone should be made to one side of the symphysis so as to save the genial tubercles and the origin of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle, as other- wise the tongue tends to fall backwards and may produce suffocation. Having extracted the central or preferably the lateral incisor tooth, a vertical incision is made down to the bone, commencing at the free margin of the lip, and carried to the lower border of the bone; it is then carried along its lower border to the angle and up the posterior margin of the ramus to a level with the lobule of the ear. The flap thus formed is raised by separating all the structures attached to the outer surface of the bone. The jaw is now gawn through at the point where the tooth has been extracted, and the knife passed along the inner side of the jaw, separating the structures attached to this surface. The jaw is now grasped by the surgeon and strongly depressed, so as to bring down the coronoid process and enable the operator to sever the tendon of the temporal muscle. The jaw can be now further depressed, care being taken not to evert it or rotate it outwards, which would endanger the internal maxillary artery, and the external pterygoid torn through or divided. The capsular ligament is now opened in front and the lateral ligaments divided, and the jaw removed with a few final touches of the knife. The antrum occasionally requires tapping for suppuration. This may be done through the socket of a tooth, preferably the first molar, the fangs of which are most intimately connected with the antrum, or through the facial aspect of the bone above the alveolar process. This latter method does not perhaps afford such efficient drainage, but there is less chance of food finding its way into the cavity. The operation may be performed by incising the mucous membrane above the second molar tooth, and driving a trocar or any sharp pointed instrument into the cavity. Hyoid Bone The Hyoid bone is named from its resemblance to the Greek upsilon ; it is also called the lingual hone, because it supports the tongue, and gives attachment to its numerous muscles. It is a bony arch, shaped like a horse-shoe, and consisting of five segments, a body, two greater cornua, and two lesser cornua. It is sus- pended from the tip of the sty- loid processes of the temporal bones by ligamentous bands, the stijlo-liyoid ligaments. The Body {basi-hyal) forms the central part of the bone, and is of a quadrilateral form ; its ante) lor surface (fig. 178), convex, directed forw^ards and upwards, is divided into tw^o parts by a vertical ridge which descends along the median line, and is crossed at right angles by a horizontal ridge, so that this surface is divided into four spaces or depressions. At the point of meeting of these tAvo lines is a prominent elevation, the tubercle. The portion above the horizontal ridge is directed upwards, and is sometimes described as the superior border. The anterior surface gives attachment to the Genio-hyoid in the greater part of its extent; above, to the Genio-hyo-giossus ; below% to the Mylo-hyoid, Stylo-hyoid, and Fig. 178.—Hyoid bone. Anterior surface (enlarged). CENlO-HYOlu/ MYLO-HYOID199 THE THORAX aponeurosis of the Digastric (suprahyoid aponeurosis) ; and between these to part of the Hyo-giossus. The posterior surface is smooth, concave, directed backwards and downwards, and separated from the epiglottis by the thyro-hyoid membrane, and by a quantity of loose areolar tissue. The superior border is rounded, and gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid membrane, part of the Genio-hyo-giossi, and Chondro- glossi muscles. The inferior border gives attachment, in front, to the Sterno-hyoid ; behind, to the Omo-hyoid and to part of the Thyro-hyoid, at its junction with the great cornu. It also gives attachment to the Levator glandulte thyroideae, when this muscle is present. The lateral surfaces are small, oval, convex facets, covered with cartilage for articulation with the greater cornua. The Greater Cornua (thyro-hyal) project backwards from the lateral surfaces of the body; they are flattened from above downwards, diminish in size from before backwards, and terminate posteriorly in a tubercle for the attachment of the lateral thyro-hyoid ligament. The outer surface gives attachment to the Hyo- glossus, their upper border to the Middle constrictor of the pharynx, their lower border to part of the Thyro-hyoid muscle. In youth, the great cornua are connected to the body by cartilaginous surfaces, and held together by ligaments ; in middle life they usually become joined. The Lesser Cornua (cerato-liyals) are two small, conical-shaped eminences, attached by their bases to the angles of junction between the body and greater cornua, and giving attachment by their apices to the stylo-hyoid ligaments.* The smaller cornua are connected to the body of the bone by a distinct diarthrpdial joint, which usually persists throughout life, but occasionally becomes ankylosed. Development.—By five centres: one for the body, and one for each cornu. Ossification commences in the body about the eighth month, and in the greater cornua towards the end of foetal life. Ossification of the lesser cornua commences some months after birth. Attachment of Muscles.—Sterno-hyoid, Thyro-hyoid, Omo-hyoid, aponeurosis of the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, Mylo-hyoid, Genio-hyoid, Genio-hyo-glossus, Chondro- glossus, Hyo-glossus, Middle constrictor of the pharynx, and occasionally a few fibres of the Lingualis. It also gives attachment to the thyro-hyoidean membrane, and the stylo-hyoid, thyro-hyoid, and hyo-epiglottic ligaments. Surface Form.—The hyoid bone can be felt in the receding angle below the chin, and the finger can be carried along the whole length of the bone to the greater cornu, which is situated just below the angle of the jaw. This process of bone is best perceived by making pressure on one cornu and so pushing the bone over to the opposite side, when the cornu of this side will be distinctly felt immediately beneath the skin. This process of bone is an important landmark in ligature of the lingual artery. Surgical Anatomy.—The hyoid bone is occasionally fractured, generally from direct violence, as in the act of garotting or throttling.' The great cornu is the part of the bone most frequently broken, but sometimes the fracture takes place through the body of the bone. In consequence of the nauscles of the tongue having important connections with this bone, there is great pain upon any attempt being made to move the tongue, as in speaking or swallowing. THE THORAX The Thorax, or Chest, is an osseo-cartilaginous cage, containing and protecting the principal organs of respiration and circulation. It is conical in shape, being narrow above and broad below, flattened from before backw^ards, and longer behind than in front. It is somewhat cordiform on transverse section. Boundaries.—The posterior surface is formed by the twelve dorsal vertebrae and the posterior part of the ribs. It is convex from above downwards, and presents on each side of the middle line a deep groove, in consequence of the direction backwards and outwards which the ribs take from their vertebral extremities to their angles. The anterior surface is flattened or slightly convex, and inclined forwards from above dowmwards. It is formed by the sternum and * These ligaments in many animals are distinct bones, and in man are occasionally ossified to a certain extent.200 THE SKELETON costal cartilages. The lateral surfaces are convex ; they are formed by the ribs, separated from each other by spaces, the intercostal spaces. These are eleven in nmnber, and are occupied by the intercostal muscles. The upioer opening of the thorax is reniform in shape, being broader from side to side than from before backwards. It is formed by tlie first dorsal vertebra behind, the upper margin of the sternum in front, and the first rib on each side. It slopes downwards and forwards, so that the anterior part of the ring is on a lower level than the posterior. The antero-posterior diameter is about two inches. The loiver opening is formed by the twelfth dorsal vertebra behind, by the twelfth rib at the sides, and in front by the cartilages of the eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh ribs, which ascend on either side and form an angle, the subcostal angle, from the centre of which the ensiform cartilage projects. It is wider trans- versely than from before backwards. It slopes obliquely downwards and backwards ; so that the cavity of the thorax is much deeper behind than in front. The Diaphragm closes in the opening forming the floor of the thorax. In the female, the thorax differs as follows from the male :—i. Its general capacity is less. 2. The sternum is shorter. 3. The upper margin of the sternum is on a level with the lower part of the body of the third dorsal vertebra, whereas in the male it is on a level with the lower part of the body of the second dorsal vertebra. 4. The upper ribs are more movable, and so allow a greater enlargement of the upper part of the thorax than in the male. The Steknum The Sternum (o-repvov, the chest) (figs. 179, 180) is a fiat, narrow bone, situated in the median line of the front of the chest, and consisting, in the adult, of three portions. It has been likened to an ancient sword : the upper piece, representing the handle, is termed the manuhrium; the middle and largest piece, which repre- sents the chief part of the blade, is termed the gladiolus ; and the inferior piece, which is likened to the point of the sword, is termed the ensiform or xiphoid ap2^t^ndix. In its natural position its inclination is oblique from above, downwards and forwards. It is flattened in front, concave behind, broad above, becoming narrowed at the point where the first and second pieces are connected ; after which it again widens a little, and is pointed at its extremity. Its average length in the adult is six inches, being rather longer in the male than in the female. The First Piece of the sternum, or Manubrium (pre-sternuvi), is of a somewhat triangular form, broad and thick above, narrow below at its junction with the middle piece. Its anterior surface, convex from side to side, concave from above downwards, is smooth, and affords attachment on each side to the Pectoralis major and sternal origin of the Sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. In well-marked bones the ridges limiting the attachment of these muscles are very distinct. Its posterior surface, concave and smooth, affords attachment on each side to the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. The superior border, the thickest, presents at its centre the pre-sternal notcli; and on each side an oval articular surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, for articulation with the sternal end of the clavicle. The inferior Zjo/y/c;'presents an oval, rough surface, covered in the recent state with a thin layer of cartilage, for articulation with the second portion of the bone. The lateral borders are marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the middle portion of the bone, forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib. These articular surfaces are separated by a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downwards and inwards. The Second Piece of the sternum, or Gladiolus {meso-sternum), considerably longer, narrower, and thinner than the first piece, is broader below than above. Its anterior surface is nearly flat, directed upwards and forwards, and marked by three transverse lines which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. These lines are produced by the union of the four separate20I THE, STERNUM Fig. 179,—Sternum and costal cartilages. Fig. 180.—Posterior surface of sternum.202 THE SKELETON pieces of which this part of the bone consists at an early period of hfe. At the junction of the third and fourth pieces is','occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen; it varies in size and form in different individuals, and pierces the bone from before backwards. This surface affords attachment on each side to the sternal origin of the Pectoralis major. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines ; but they are less distinct than those in front: this surface affords attachment below, on each side, to the Triangularis sterni muscle, and occasionally presents the posterior opening of the sternal foramen. The superior border presents an oval surface for articulation with the manubrium. The inferior border is narrow, and articulates with the ensiform appendix. Each lateral border presents, at each superior angle, a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the second rib ; the four succeeding angular depressions receive the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth,' and sixth ribs, whilst each inferior angle presents a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the ensiform appendix, forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated by a series of curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from above downwards, and correspond to the intercostal spaces. Most of the cartilages belonging to the true ribs, as will be seen from the foregoing description, articulate Avith the sternum at the line of junction of two of its primitive component segments. This is well seen in many of the lower animals, where the separate parts of the bone remain ununited longer than in man. In this respect a striking analogy exists between the mode of connection of the ribs with the vertebral column, and the connection of their cartilages with the sternal column. The Third Piece of the sternum, the Ensiform or Xiphoid Appendix {nwtn- sternum), is the smallest of the three ; it is thin and elongated in form, cartilaginous in structure in youth, but more or less ossified at its upper part in the adult. Its anterior surface affords attachment to the chondro-xiphoid ligament; its posterior surface, to some of the fibres of the Diaphragm and Triangularis sterni muscles; its lateral borders, to the aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles. Above, it articulates with the lower end of the gladiolus, and at each superior angle presents a facet for the lower half of the cartilage of the seventh rib; below, by its pointed extremity, it gives attachment to the linea alba. This portion of the sternum is very various in appearance, being sometimes pointed, broad and thin, sometimes bifid, or perforated by a round hole, occasionally curved, or deflected considerably to one or the other side. Structure.—The bone is composed of delicate cancellous structure, covered by a thin layer of compact tissue, Avhich is thickest in the manubrium, between the articular facets for the clavicles. Development.—The sternum, including the ensiform appendix, is developed by six centres : one for the first piece or manubrium, four for the second piece or gladiolus, and one for the ensiform appendix. Up to the middle of foetal life the sternum is entirely cartilaginous, and when ossification takes place the ossific granules are deposited in the middle of the intervals between the articular depres- sions for the costal cartilages, in the followiitg- order (fig. i8i). In the first piece, between the fifth and sixth months ; in the second and third, between the sixth and seventh months ; in the fourth piece, at the ninth month ; in the fifth, within the first year, or between the first and second years after birth ; and in the ensiform appendix, between the second and the seventeenth or eighteenth years, by a single centre which makes its appearance at the upper part, and proceeds gradually downwards. To these may be added the occasional existence, as described by Breschet, of two small episternal centres, which make their appearance one on each side of the interclavicular notch. They are probably vestiges of the episternal bone of the monotremata and lizards. It occasionally happens that some of the segments are formed from more than one centre, the number and position of which vary (fig. 183). Thus, the first piece may have two, three, or even six centres. When two are present, they are generally situated one above the other, the upper one203 THE STEENUM being the larger; * the second piece has seldom more than one ; the third, fom'th, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centres placed laterally, the irregular union of which will serve to explain the occasional occurrence of the sternal foramen (fig. 184), or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects this part of the bone, and which is further explained by the manner in which the cartilaginous matrix, in which ossifica- tion takes place, is formed (see page 85). Union of the various centres of the gladiolus commences about puberty, from below, and proceeds upwards, so that by the age of twenty-five they are all united, and this portion of bone consists of one piece (fig. 182). The ensiform cartilage becomes joined to the gladiolus about forty. The manu- brium is occasionally, but not invariably, joined to the gladiolus in advanced life by bone.

Tiiherosiiij The Ribs The Ribs are ehistic arches of bone, which form the chief part of the thoracic walls. They are twelve in number on each side ; but this number may be increased by the development of a cervical or lumbar rib, or may be dimin- ished to eleven. The first seven are connected behind with the spine, and in front with the sternum, through the intervention of the costal cartilages; they are called true ribs. The remaining five are false ribs ; of these, the first three have their cartilages attached to the cartilage of the rib above : the last two are free at their anterior extremities; they are termed floating ribs. The ribs vary in their direction, the upper ones being less oblique than those lower down and occupying the middle of the series. The extent of obliquity reaches its maximum at the ninth rib, and gradually decreases from that rib to the twelfth. The ribs are situated one below the other in such a manner that spaces are left between them, which are called intercostal spaces. The length of these spaces corresponds to the length of the ribs ; their breadth is more considerable in front than behind, and between the upper than between the lower ribs. The ribs increase in length from the first to the seventh, when they again diminish to the twelfth. In breadth they decrease from above downwards ; in the upper ten the greatest breadth is at the sternal extremity. Common Characters of the Ribs (fi< A rib from the middle of the series should be taken in order to study the common characters of the ribs. Each rib presents two extremities, a pos- terior or vertebral, an anterior or sternal, and an intervening portion—the body or shaft. The posterior or vertebral extremity pre- sents for examination a head, neck, and tuber- osity. The head (fig. 186) is marked by a kidney- shaped articular surface, divided by a horizontal ridge into two facets for articulation with the costal cavity formed by the junction of the bodies of two contiguous dorsal vertebrae ; the upper facet is small, the inferior one of larger size ; the ridge separating them serves for the attachment of the interarticular ligament. The neck is that flattened portion of the rib which extends outwards from the head; it is about an inch long, and is placed in front of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae with Avhich the head articulates. Its anterior surface is flat and smooth, posterior rough, for the attachment of the middle costo-transverse ligament, and perforated by numerous foramina, the 185).-THE RIBS 205 direction of wliich is less constant than those found on the inner surface of the shaft. Of its two borders the superior presents a rough crest for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse ligament; its inferior border is rounded. On the posterior surface of the neck, just where it joins the shaft, and nearer the lower than the upper border, is an eminence—the tuberosity, or tubercle ; it consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular portion, the more internal and inferior of the two, presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the extremity of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which the head is connected. The non-articular portion is a rough elevation, which affords attachment to the posterior costo-transverse ligament. The tubercle is much more prominent in the upper than in the lower ribs. The shaft is thin and flat, so as to present two surfaces, an external and an internal; and two borders, a superior and an inferior. The external surface is convex, smooth, and marked, at its back part, a little in front of the tuberosity, by a prominent line, directed obliquely from above downwards and outwards; this gives attachment to a tendon of the Ilio-costalis muscle, or of one of its accessory portions, and is called the angle. At this point the rib is bent in two directions. If the rib is laid upon its lower border, it will be seen that the portion of the shaft in front of the angle rests upon this border, while the portion of the shaft behind the angle is bent inwards and at the same time tilted upwards. The interval betw^een the angle and the tuberosity increases gradually from the second to the tenth rib. The portion of bone between these two parts is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment of the Longissimus dorsi muscle. The Fig. 186.—Vertebral extremity of a rib. External surface. For anterior costo-transverse ligament For -poste^'ior costo-transverse ligament Facet for body of upper dorsal vertehra Bidge for interarticular ligament Facet for body of lower dorsal vertebra For transverse process of lower dorsal vertehra portion of bone between the tubercle and sternal extremity is also slightly twisted upon its own axis, the external surface looking downwards behind the angle, a little upwards in front of it. This surface presents, towards its sternal extremity, an oblique line, the anterior angle. The internal surface is concave, smooth, directed a little upwards behind the angle, a little downwards in front of it. This surface is marked by a ridge w^hich commences at the lower extremity of the head; it is strongly marked as far as the inner side of the angle, and gradually becomes lost at the junction of the anterior with the middle third of the bone. The interval between it and the inferior border is deeply grooved, to lodge the intercostal vessels and nerve. At the back part of the bone, this groove belongs to the inferior border, but just in front of the angle, where it is deepest and broadest, it corresponds to the internal surface. The superior edge of the groove is rounded ; it serves for the attachment of the Internal intercostal muscle. The inferior edge corresponds to the lower margin of the rib, and gives attachment to the External intercostal. Within the groove are seen the orifices of numerous small foramina, which traverse the wall of the shaft obliquely £i'om before backwards. The superior border, thick and rounded, is marked by an external and an internal lip, more distinct behind than in front; they serve for the attachment of the External and Internal inter- costal muscles. The irferior border, thin and sharp, has attached to it the External intercostal muscle. The anterior or sternal extremity is flattened, and presents a porous, oval, concave depretssion, into which the costal cartilage is received.2o6 THE SKELETON Peculiae Eibs The ribs which require especial consideration are five in number—viz. the first second, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first rib (fig. 187) is one of the shortest and the most curved of all the ribs ; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upwards and downwards, and its borders Peculiar ribs. inwards and outwards. The head is of small size, rounded, and presents only a single articular facet for articulation with the body of the first dorsal vertebra. The nech is narrow and rounded. The tuberosity, thick and prominent, rests on the outer border. There is no angle, but in this situation the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity of the bend upwards, so that the head of the bone is directedTHE COSTAL CARTILAGES 207 downwards. The upper surface of the shaft is marked by two shallow depressions, separated from one another by a small rough surface for the attachment of the Scalenus anticus muscle—the groove in front of it transmitting the subclavian vein, that behind it the subclavian artery. Between the groove for the subclavian artery and the tuberosity is a rough surface for the attachment of the Scalenus medius muscle. The under surface is smooth, and destitute of the groove observed on the other ribs. The outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment to the first serration of the Serratus magnus ; the inner is concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its centre by the commence- ment of the rough surface for the Scalenus anticus. The anterior extremity is larger and thicker than any of the other ribs. The second rib (fig. 188) is much longer than the first, but bears a very con- siderable resemblance to it in the direction of its curvature. The non-articular portion of the tuberosity is occasionally only slightly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tuberosity, and the shaft is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid; but there is a similar though slighter bend, with its convexity upwards, to that found in the first rib. The shaft is not horizontal, like that of the first rib ; its outer surface, which is convex, look- ing upwards and a little outwards. It presents, near the middle, a rough eminence for the attachment of the second and third digitations of the Serratus magnus; behind and above which is attached the Scalenus posticus. The inner surface, smooth and concave, is directed downwards and a little inwards: it presents a short groove towards its posterior part. The tenth rib (fig. 189) has only a single articular facet on its head. The eleventh and twelfth ribs (figs. 190 and 191) have each a single articular facet on the head, which is of rather large size ; they have no neck or tuberosity, and are pointed at the extremity. The eleventh has a slight angle and a shallow groove on the lower border. The twelfth has neither, and is much shorter than the eleventh, and the head has a slight inclination downwards. Structure.—The ribs consist of cancellous tissue, enclosed in a thin, compact layer. Development.—Each rib, with the exception of the last two, is developed by three centres : one for the shaft, one for the head, and one for the tubercle. The last two have only two centres, that for the tubercle being wanting. Ossification commences in the shaft of the ribs at a very early period, before its appearance in the vertebra9. The epiphysis of the head, which is of a slightly angular shape, and that for the tubercle, of a lenticular form, make their appearance between the six- teenth and twentieth years, and are not united to the rest of the bone until about the twenty-fifth year. Attachment of Muscles.—To nineteen : the Internal and External intercostals. Scalenus anticus. Scalenus medius. Scalenus posticus, Pectoralis minor, Serratus magnus, Obliquus externus, Quadratus lumborum. Diaphragm, Latissimus dorsi, Serratus posticus superior, Serratus posticus inferior, Ilio-costalis, Musculus accessorius ad ilio-costalem, Longissimus dorsi, Cervicalis ascendens, Levatores costarum, and Infra-costales. The Costal Cartilages The Costal Cartilages (fig. 179, p. 201) are white, elastic structures, which serve to prolong the ribs forward to the front of the chest, and contribute very materially to the elasticity of its walls. The first seven are connected with the sternum, the next three with the lower border of the cartilage of the preceding rib. The car- tilages of the last two ribs, which have pointed extremities, float freely in the walls of the abdomen. Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth, and direction. They increase in length from the first to the seventh, then gradually diminish to the last. They diminish in breadth, as well as the intervals between them, from the first to the last. They are broad at their attachment to2o8 THE SKELETON the ribs, and taper towards their sternal extremities, excepting the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact. In direction they also vary : the first descends a little, the second is horizontal, the third ascends slightly, whilst all the rest follow the course of the ribs for a short extent, and then ascend to the sternum or preceding cartilage. Each costal cartilage presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The anterior surface is convex, and looks forwards and upwards : that of the first gives attachment to the costo-clavicular ligament and the Subclavius muscle ; that of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, at their sternal ends, to the Pectoralis major.* The others are covered by, and give partial attach- ment to, some of the great flat muscles of the abdomen. The posterior surface is concave, and directed backwards and downwards, the first giving attachment to the Sterno-thyroid, and the six or seven inferior ones aftbrding attachment to the Transversalis muscle and the Diaphragm. Of the two borders, the superior is concave, the inferior convex : they afford attachment to the Intercostal muscles, the upper border of the sixth giving attachment to the Pectoralis major muscle. The contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages present small, smooth, oblong-shaped facets at tlie points where they articulate. Of the two extremities, the outer one is continuous with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs. The inner extremity of the first is continuous with the sternum ; the six succeeding ones have rounded extremities, which are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins of the sternum. The inner extremities of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages are pointed, and are connected with the cartilage above. Those of the eleventh and twelfth are free and pointed. The costal cartilages are most elastic in youth, those of the false ribs being more so than the true. In old age they become of a deep yellow colour, and are prone to calcify. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine : the Subclavius, Sterno-thyroid, Pectoralis major. Internal oblique, Transversalis, Eectus, Diaphragm, Triangularis sterni, and Internal intercostals. Surface Form.—The bones of the chest are to a very considerable extent covered by muscles, so that in the strongly-developed muscular subject they are for the most part concealed. In the emaciated subject, on the other hand, the ribs, especially in the lower and lateral region, stand out as prominent ridges with the sunken, intercostal spaces between them. In the middle line, in front, the superficial surface of the sternum is to be felt through- out its entire length, at the bottom of a deep median furrow situated between the two great pectoral muscles and called the sternal furrow. These muscles overlap the anterior surface somewhat, so that the whole of the sternum in its entire width is not subcu- taneous, and this overlapping is greater opposite the centre of the bone than above and below, so that the furrow is wider at its upper and low er part, but narrower in the middle. The centre of the upper border of the sternum is ^•isible, constituting the presternal notch, but the lateral parts of this border are obscured by the tendinous origins of the Sterno-mastoid muscles, which present themselves as oblicjue tendinous cords, which narrow and deepen the notch. Lower down on the subcutaneous surface a w^ell-defined transverse ridge is always to be felt. This denotes the line of junction of the m;\.nubrium and body of the bone and is a useful i^uide to the second costal cartilat^e, and tluis to the identity of any given rib. The second rib bein.i^' found, through its costal cartilage, it is easy to count downwards and find any other. Lelow this point the furrow spreads out, and, exposing more of the surface of tlie body of the sternum, terminates below in a sudden depression, the infra-sternal depression or pit of the stomach {scrohiculiis cordis), which. corresponds to the ensiform cartilage. This depression lies between the cartilages of the seventh rib, and in it the ensiform cartilage may be felt. The sternum iii its vertical diameter presents a general convexity forwards, the most prominent point of which is at the joint between the manubrium and gladiolus. On each side of the sternum the costal cartilages and ribs on the front of the chest are partially obscured by the great pectoral muscle; through which, however, they are to be felt as ridges, with depressed intervals between them, corresponding to the intercostal spaces. Of these spaces, the one between the second and third ribs is the widest, the next * The first and seventh also, occasionally, give origin to the same muscle.COSTAL CARTILAGES 209 two somewhat narrower, and the remainder, with the exception of the last two, compara- tively narrow. The lower border of the Pectoralis major muscle corresponds to the fifth rib, and below this, on the front of the chest, the broad, flat outline of the ribs, as they begin to ascend, and the more rounded outline of the costal cartilages, are often visible. The lower boundary of the front of the thorax, the abdomino-tJioracic arch, which is most plainly seen by arching the body backwards, is formed by the ensiform cartilage and the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, and the extremities of the eleventh and twelfth ribs or their cartilages. On each side of the chest, from the axilla downwards, the flattened external surfaces of the ribs may be defined in the form of oblic^ue ridges, separated by depressions corre- sponding to the intercostal spaces. They are, however, covered by muscles, which obscure their outline to a certain extent in the strongly developed. Nevertheless, the ribs, with the exception of the first, can generally be followed over the front and sides of the chest without difiicidty. The first rib, being almost completely covered by the clavicle and scapula, can only be distinguished in a small portion of its extent. At the back, the angles of the ribs form a slightly-marked oblique line, on each side of and some distance from the vertebral spines. This line diverges somewhat as it descends, and external to it is a broad, convex surface, caused by the projection of the ribs beyond their angles. Over this sm'face, except where covered by the scapula, the individual ribs can be distinguished. Surgical Anatomy.—Malformations of the sternum present nothing of surgical importance beyond the fact that abscesses of the mediastinum may sometimes escape tlnrough the sternal foramen. Fractures of the sternum are by no means common, owing, no doubt, to the elasticity of the ribs and their cartilages which support it like so many sprmgs. It is frequently associated with fracture of the spine, and may be caused by forcibly bending the body either backwards; or forwards until the chin becomes impacted against the top of the sternum. It may also be fractured by direct violence or by muscular action. The fracture usually occurs in the upper half of the body of the bone. Dislocation of the gladiolus from the manubrium also takes place, and is sometimes described as a fracture. The bone being subcutaneous is frequently the seat of gummatous tumours and not uncommonly is affected with caries. Occasionally the bone, and especially its ensiform appendix, becomes altered in shape and driven inwards by the pressure, in workmen, of tools against their chest. The ribs are frequently broken, though from their connections and shape they are able to withstand great force, yielding under the injury and recovering themselves like a spring. The middle of the series are the ones most liable to fracture. The first and to a less extent the second, being protected by the clavicle, are rarely fractured; and the eleventh and twelfth on accoimt of their loose and floating condition enjoy a like immunity. The fracture generally occurs from indirect violence, from forcible compression of the chest wall, and the bone then gives way at its weakest part, i.e. just in front of the angle. But the ribs may also be broken by direct violence, when the bone gives way and is driven inwards at the point struck, or by muscular action. It seems probable, however, that in these latter cases the bone has undergone some atrophic changes. Fracture of the ribs is frequently complicated with some injury to the viscera contained within the thorax or upper part of the abdominal cavity, and this is most likely to occur in fractures from direct violence. Fracture of the costal cartilages may also take place, though it is a comparatively rare injury. The thorax is frequently found to be altered in shape in certain diseases. The rickety thorax is caused chiefly by atmospheric pressure. The balance between the air on the inside of the chest and the outside during some stage of respiration is not equal, the preponderance being in favour of the air outside, and this, acting on the softened ribs, causes them to be forced in at the junction of the cartilages with the bones, which is the weakest part. In consequence of this the sternum projects forwards, with a deep depression on either side caused by the sinking in of the softened ribs. The depression is less on the left side, on account of the ribs being supported by the heart. The condition is knowm as ' pigeon-breast.' The lower ribs, however, are not involved in this deformity, as they are prevented from falling in by the ^jresence of the stomach, liver, and spleen. And when the liver and spleen are enlarged, as they sometimes are in rickets, the lower ribs may be pushed outwards: this causes a transverse constriction just above the costal arch. The anterior extremities of the ribs are usually enlarged in rickets, giving rise to what has been termed the 'rickety rosary.' The i^^i^t^^isical chest is often long and narrow, flattened from before backwards, and with great obliquity of the ribs and projection of the scapulae. In imlmonarij einphysema the chest is enlarged in all its diameters, and presents on section an almost circidar outline. It has received the name of the ' barrel-shaped chest.' In severe cases of lateral curvature of the spine, the thorax becomes much distorted. In consequence of the rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae, which takes place in this disease, the ribs opposite the convexity of the dorsal curve become extremel}^ convex behind, being thrown out and bulging, and at the same time flattened in front, so that the two ends of the same rib are almost parallel. Coincident PTHE SKELETON 2IO with this the ribs on the opposite side, on the concavity of the cnrve. are sunk an(| depressed behind, and bulging and convex in front. In addition to this the ribs become occasionally welded together by bony material. The ribs are frequently the seat of necrosis leading to abscesses and sinuses, which may burrow to a considerable extent over the wall of the chest. The only special anatomical point in connection with these is that care must be taken in dealing with them, that the intercostal space is not punctured and the pleural cavity opened or the intercostal vessels wounded. In cases of empyema the chest re(]uires opening to evacuate the pus. There is considerable difference of opinion as to the best position to do this. Probably the best place in most cases will be found to be between the fifth and sixth ribs, in or a little in front of the mid-axillary line. This is the last part of the cavity- to be closed by the expansion of the lung; it is not thickly covered by soft parts ; the space between the two ribs is sufficiently great to allow of the introduction of a fair sized drainage tube, and the opening is in a dependent position, when the x^atient is confined to bed, as he usually inclines towards the affected side, so as to allow the sound lung the freest possible play, and so permits of efficient drainage. OF THE EXTREMITIES The extremities, or limbs, are those long, jointed appendages of the body which are connected to the trunk by one end, and free in the rest of their extent. They Sivefour in number: an ujjper or thoracic i^air, connected with the thorax through the intervention of the shoulder, and subservient mainly to prehension ; and a lower pair, connected wdth the pelvis, intended for support and locomotion. Both pairs of limbs are constructed after one common type, so that they present numerous analogies; while, at the same time, certain differences are observed in each, dependent on the peculiar offices they have to perform. The bones by which the upper and lower limbs are attached to the trunk are named respectively the shoulder o^ndi pelvic girdles, ajud they are constructed on the same general type, though presenting certain modifications relating to the different uses to which the upper and lower limbs are respectively applied. The shoulder girdle is formed by the scapula and clavicle, and is imperfect in front and behind. In front, however, the girdle is completed by the upper end of the sternum, with which the inner extremities of the clavicle articulate. Behind, the girdle is widely imperfect, and the scapula is connected to the trunk by muscles only. The pelvic girdle is formed by the innominate bones, and is completed in front, through the symphysis pubis, at which the two innominate bones articulate with each other. It is imperfect behind, but the intervening gap is filled in by the upper part of the sacrum. The pelvic girdle, therefore, presents, with the sacrum, a complete ring, comparatively fixed, and presenting an arched form Avhich confers upon it a solidity manifestly intended for the support of the trunk, and in marked contrast to the lightness and mobility of the shoulder girdle. With regard to the morphology of these girdles, the blade of the scapula is generally believed to correspond to the ilium : but with regard to the clavicles there is some difference of opinion ; formerly it w^as believed that they corresponded to the ossa pubis meeting at the symphysis, but it is now generally taught that the clavicle has no homologue in the pelvic girdle, and that the os pubis and ischium are represented by the small coracoid process in man and most mammals. Of the Uppeii Extremity * The bones of the upper extremity consist of those of the shoulder girdle, of the arm, the forearm, and the hand. The shoulder girdle consists of two bones, the clavicle and the scapula. The Clavicle The Clavicle (clavis, a key), or collar-bone, forms the anterior portion of the shoulder girdle. It is a long bone, curved somewhat like the italic letter /, and placed nearly horizontally at the upper and anterior part of the thorax, immediately above the first rib. It articulates by its inner extremity with the upper border ofCLAVICLE 211 the sternum, and by its outer extremity with the acromion process of the scapula ; serving to sustain the upper extremity in the various positions which it assumes, whilst, at the same time, it allows of great latitude of motion in the arm.* It presents a double curvature, when looked at in front; the convexity being forwards at the sternal end, and the concavity at the scapular end. Its outer third is flattened from above downwards, and extends, in the natural position of the bone, from a point opposite the coracoid process to the acromion. Its inner two-thirds are of a cylindrical form, and extend from the sternum to a point opposite the coracoid process of the scapula. External or Flattened Portion.—The outer third is flattened from above down- wards, so as to present two surfaces, an upper and a lower; and two borders, an anterior and a posterior. The upper surface is flattened, rough, marked by impressions for the attachment of the Deltoid in front, and the Trapezius behind : between these two impressions, externally, a small portion of the bone is sub- cutaneous. The under surface is flattened. At its posterior border, a little external to the point where the prismatic joins with the flattened portion, is a rough eminence, the conoid tubercle ; this, in the natural position of the bone, surmounts the coracoid process of the scapula, and gives attachment to the conoid ligament. From this tubercle, an oblique line, occasionally a depression, passes forwards and outwards to near the outer end of the anterior border; it is called the oblique line, and affords attachment to the trapezoid ligament. The anterior border is concave, thin, and rough ; and gives attachment to the Deltoid ; it occasionally presents, at its inner end, at the commencement of the deltoid impression, a tubercle, the deltoid tubercle, which is sometimes to be felt in the living subject. The postej^ior border is convex, rough, broader than the anterior, and gives attachment to the Trapezius. Internal or Cylindrical Portion.—The cylindrical portion forms the inner tiuo- thirds of the bone. It is curved so as to be convex in front, concave behind, and is marked by three borders, separating three surfaces. The anterior border is continuous with the anterior margin of the flat portion. At its commencement it is smooth, and corresponds to the interval between the attachment of the Pectoralis major and Deltoid muscles; at the inner half of the clavicle it forms the lower boundary of an elliptical space for the attachment of the clavicular portion of the Pectoralis major, and approaches the posterior border of the bone. The superior border is continuous with the posterior margin of the flat portion, and separates the anterior from the posterior surface. At its commencement it is smooth and rounded, becomes rough towards the inner third for the attachment of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, and terminates at the upper angle of the sternal extremity. The posterior or subclavian border separates the posterior from the inferior surface, and extends from the conoid tubercle to the rhomboid impression. It forms the posterior boundary of the groove for the Subclavius muscle, and gives attachment to a layer of cervical fascia, covering the Omo-hyoid muscle. The anterior surface is included between the superior and anterior borders. It is directed forwards and a little upwards at the sternal end, outwards and still more upwards at the acromial extremity, where it becomes continuous with the upper surface of the flat portion. Externally, it is smooth, convex, nearly subcutaneous, being covered only by the Platysma; but, corresponding to the inner half of the bone, it is divided by a more or less prominent line into two parts : a lower portion, elliptical in form, rough, and slightly convex, for the attachment of the Pectoralis major ; and an upper part, which is rough, for the attachment of the Sterno-cleido-mastoid. Between the two muscular impressions is a small, subcutaneous interval. The posterior or cervical * The clavicle acts especially as a fulcrum to enable the muscles to give lateral motion to the arm. It is accordingly absent in those animals whose fore limbs are used owlj for progression, but is present for the most part in those animals whose anterior extremities are clawed and used for prehension, though in some of them—as, for instance, in a large number of the carnivora—it is merely a rudimentary bone suspended among the muscles, and not articulating either with the scapula or sternum. P 2 'THE SKELETON 212 surface is smooth, flat, and looks backwards towards the root of the neck. It is limited, above, by the superior border ; below, by the subclavian border ; internally, by the margin of the sternal extremity; externally, it is continuous with the posterior border of the flat portion. It is concave from within outwards, and is in relation, by its lower part, with the suprascapular vessels. This surface, at about the junction of the inner and outer curves, is also in close relation with the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels. It gives attachment, near the sternal extremity, to part of the Sterno-hyoid muscle ; and presents, at or near the middle, a foramen, directed obliquely outwards, which transmits the chief nutrient artery of the bone. Sometimes there are two foramina on the posterior surface, or one on the posterior, the other on the inferior surface. The inferior or subclavian surface is bounded, in front, by the anterior border ; behind, by the subclavian border. It is narrow internally, but gradually increases in width externally, and is continuous with the Fig. 192.—Left clavicle. Superior surface. Acromial extremity Fig. 193.—Left clavicle. Inferior surface. under surface of. the flat portion. Commencing at the sternal extremity may be seen a small facet for articulation with the cartilage of the first rib. This is con- tinuous with the articular surface at the sternal end of the bone. External to this is a broad, rough impression, the rhomboid, rather more than an inch in length, for the attachment of the costo-clavicular (rhomboid) ligament. The remaining part of this surface is occupied by a longitudinal groove, the subclavian groove, broad and smooth externally, narrow and more uneven internally; it gives attachment to the Subclavius muscle, and, by its anterior margin, to the costo-coracoid membrane. Not unfrequently this groove is subdivided into two parts by a longitudinal line, which gives attachment to the intermuscular septum of the Subclavius muscle. The internal or sternal extremity of the clavicle is triangular in form, directed inwards, and a little downwards and forwards ; and presents an articular facet, concave from before backwards, convex from above downwards, which articulates with the sternum through the intervention of an interarticular fibro-cartilage; the circumference of the articular surface is rough, for the attachment of numerous ligaments. The posterior border of this surface is prolonged backwards so as to213 CLAVICLE increase the size of the articular facet ; the upper border gives attachment to the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the lower border is continuous with the costal facet on the inner end of the inferior or subclavian surface, which articulates with the cartilage of the first rib. The outer or acromial extremity, directed outwards and forwards, presents a small, flattened, oval facet, which looks obliquely downwards, for articulation with the acromion process of the scapula. The circumference of the articular facet is rough, especially above, for the attachment of the acromio-clavicular ligaments. Peculiarities of tlie Bone in the Sexes and in Individuals.—In the female, the clavicle is generally shorter, thinner, less curved, and smoother than in the male. In those persons who perform considerable manual labour, which brings into con- stant action the muscles connected with this bone, it becomes thicker and more curved, its ridges for muscular attachment become prominently marked, and its sternal end of a prismatic form. The right clavicle is generally longer, thicker, and rougher than the left. Structure.—The shaft, as well as the extremities, consists of cancellous tissue, invested in a compact layer much thicker in the middle than at either end. The clavicle is highly elastic, by reason of its curves. From the experiments of Mr. Ward, it has been shown that it possesses sufficient longitudinal elastic force to project its own weight nearly two feet on a level surface, when a smart blow is struck on it; and sufficient transverse elastic force, opposite the centre of its anterior convexity, to throw its own weight about a foot. This extent of elastic power must serve to moderate very considerably the effect of concussions received upon the point of the shoulder. Development.—By two centres : one for the shaft, and one for the sternal extremity. The centre for the shaft appears very early, before any other bone ; according to Beclard, as early as the thirtieth day. The centre for the sternal end makes its appearance about the eighteenth or twentieth year, and unites with the rest of the bone about the twenty-fifth year. Articulations.—With the sternum, scapula, and cartilage of the first rib. Attachment of Muscles.—To six : the Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Trapezius, Pecto- ralis major, Deltoid, Subclavius, and Sterno-hyoid. Surface Form.—The clavicle can be felt throughout its entire length, even m persons who are very fat. Conimencmg at the inner end, the enlarged sternal extremity, where the bone projects above the upper margin of the sternum, can be felt, forming with the sternum and the rounded tendon of the Sterno-mastoid a V-shaped notch, the presternal notch. Passing outwards, the shaft of the bone can be felt immediately under the skin, with its convexity forwards in the inner two-thirds, the surface partially obscured above and below by the attachments of the Sterno-mastoid and Pectoralis major muscles. ^ In the outer third it forms a gentle curve backwards, and terminates at the outer end in a somewhat enlarged extremity which articulates with the acromial process of the scapula. The direction of the clavicle is almost, if not quite, horizontal when the arm is lying quietly by the side, though in well-developed subjects it may incline a little upwards at its outer end. Its direction is, however, very changeable with the varying movements of the shoulder-joint. Surgical Anatomy.—The clavicle is the most frequently broken of any single bone in the body. This is due to the fact that it is much exposed to violence, and is the only bony connection between the upper limb and the trunk. The bone, moreover, is slender, and is very superficial. The bone may be broken by direct or indirect violence, or by muscular action. The most common cause is, however, from indirect violence, and the bone then gives way at the junction of the outer with the inner two-thirds of the bone ; that is to say, at the junction of the two curves, for this is the weakest part of the bone. The fi'acture is generally oblique, and the displacement of the fragments is inwards, away from the surface of the body, hence compound fracture of the clavicle is of rare occurrence. Beneath the bone the main vessels of the upper limb and the great nerve-cords of the brachial plexus lie on the first rib and are liable to be wounded in fracture, especially in fracture fi-om direct violence, when the force of the blow drives the broken ends inwards. Fortunately the subclavius muscle is interposed between these structures and the clavicle, and this often protects them from injury. The clavicle is not uncommonly the seat of sarcomatous tumours, rendering the opera- tion of excision of the entire bone necessary. This is an operation of considerable difficulty and danger. It is best performed by exposing the bone freely, disarticulating at the214 THE SKELETON acromial end, and turning it inwards. The removal of the outer part is comparatively' easy, but resection of the inner part is fraught with difficulty, the main danger being the risk of wounding the great veins which are in relation M ith its under surfece. ^ The Scapula The Scapula {crKa-n-dv-q, a apade) forms the back part of the shoulder girdle. It is a large, fiat bone, triangular in shape, situated at the posterior aspect and side of the thorax, between the second and seventh or sometimes the eighth ribs, its poste- rior border or base being about an inch from, and nearly, but not quite parallel with, Fig. 194.—Left scapula. Anterior sm-face, or venter. the spinous processes of the vertebra, so that it is rather closer to them above than below. It presents for examination two surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The anterior surface, or venter (fig. 194), presents a broad concavity, the sub- scapular fossa. It is marked, in the posterior two-thirds, by several oblique ridges, w^hich pass from behind obliquely outwards and upwards ; the anterior third is smooth. The oblique ridges 2:ive attachment to the tendinous intersections, andSCAPULA 215 the surfaces between them to the fleshy fibres, of the Subscapularis muscle. The anterior third of the fossa, which is smooth, is covered by, but does not afford attachment to, the fibres of this muscle. The ventei* is separated from the posterior border by a smooth, triangular margin at the superior and inferior angles, and in the interval between these by a narrow edge which is often deficient. This marginal surface afibrds attachment throughout its entire extent to the Serratus magnus muscle. The subscapular fossa presents a transverse depression at its upper part, where the bone appears to be bent on itself, forming a consider- able angle, called the subscapular angle, thus giving greater strength to the body of the bone from its arched form ; while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and acromion process. It is in this situation that the fossa is deepest ; so that the thickest part of the Subscapularis muscle lies in a line perpendicular to the plane of the glenoid cavity, and must consequently operate most effectively on the head of the humerus, which is contained in that cavity. The posterior surface, or dorsum (fig. 195), is arched from above downwards, alternately concave and convex from side to side. It is subdivided unequally into two parts by the spine ; the portion above the spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa. The supraspinous fossa, the smaller of the two, is concave, smooth, and broader at the vertebral than at the humeral extremity. It afibrds attachment by its inner two-thirds to the Supraspinatus muscle. The infraspinous fossa is much larger than the preceding ; towards its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is seen at its upper part ; its centre presents a promi- nent convexity, whilst towards the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper towards the lower part. The inner two-thirds of this surface affords attachment to the Infraspinatus muscle ; the outer third is only covered by it, without giving origin to its fibres. This surface is separated from the axillary border by an elevated ridge, which runs from the lower part of the glenoid cavity, downwards and backwards to the posterior border, about an inch above the inferior angle. The ridge serves for the attachment of a strong aponeurosis, which sepa- rates the Infraspinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between this line and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and traversed near its centre by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapulae vessels; it afibrds attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus dorsi glides ; sometimes the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibres from this part. The broad and narrow portions of bone above alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border, domiwards and backwards, to meet the elevated ridge : to it is attached the aponeurosis separating the two Teres muscles from each other. The Spine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the inner four-fifths of the dorsum of the scapula at its upper part, and separates the supra- from the infra-spinous fossa: it commences at the vertebral border by a smooth, triangular surface, over which the Trapezius glides, separated from the bone by a bursa ; and, gradually becoming more elevated as it passes forwards, terminates in the acromion process, which overhangs the shoulder-joint. The spine is triangular, and flattened from above downwards, its apex corresponding to the posterior border, its base (which is directed outwards) to the neck of the scapula. It presents two surfaces and three borders. Its superior surface is concave, assists in forming the supraspinous fossa, and affords attachment to part of the Supra- spinatus muscle. Its inferior surface forms part of the infraspinous fossa, gives origin to part of the Infraspinatus muscle, and presents near its centre the orifice of a nutrient canal. Of the three borders, the anterior is attached to the dorsum of the bone ; the posterior, or crest of the spine, is broad, and presents two lips and an intervening rough interval. To the superior lip is attached the Trapezius, to the extent shown in the figure. A rough tubercle is generally seen occupying that portion of the spine which receives the insertion of the middle and inferiorTHE SKELETON 2l6 fibres of this muscle. To the inferior lip, throughout its whole length, is attached the Deltoid. The interval between the lips is also partly covered by the fibres of these muscles. The external border, or hase, the shortest of the three, is slightly concave, its edge thick and round, continuous above with the under surface of the acromion process, below with the neck of the scapula. The narrow portion of bone Fig. 195.-—Left scapula. Posterior surface, or dorsum. external to this border, and separating it from the glenoid cavity, is called the great scapular notch, and serves to connect the supra- and infra-spinous fossae. The Acromion Process, so called from forming the summit of the shoulder {aKpov, a summit; oj/xos, the shoulder), is a large and somewhat triangular process, flattened from behind forwards, directed at first a little outwards, and then curving forwards and upwards, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, is convex, rough, and gives attachment to some fibres of the Deltoid, and in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous. Its217 SCAPULA under surface is smooth and concave. Its outer border, is thick and irregular, and presents three or four tubercles for the tendinous origins of the Deltoid muscle. Its inner margin, shorter than the outer, is concave, gives attachment to a portion of the Trapezius muscle, and presents about its centre a small, oval surface for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle. Its apex, which corresponds to the point of meeting of these two borders in front, is thin, and has attached to it the coraco-acromial ligament. Of the three borders or costae of the scapula, the superior is the shortest and thinnest; it is concave, terminating at its inner extremity at the superior angle, at its outer extremity at the coracoid process. At its outer part is a deep, semicircular notch, the supra scapular, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. This notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve. The adjacent margin of the superior border affords attachment to the Omo-hyoid muscle. The external, or axillary, border is the thickest of the three. It commences above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downwards and backwards to the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression (the infra-glenoid tubercle), about an inch in length, which affords attachment to the long head of the Triceps muscle ; to this succeeds a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as its lower third, and affords origin to part of the Subscapularis muscle. The inferior third of this border, which is thin and sharp, serves for the attachment of a few fibres of the Teres major behind, and of the Subscapularis in front. The internal, or vertebral, border, also named the base, is the longest of the three, and extends from the superior to the inferior angle of the bone. It is arched, intermediate in thickness between the superior and the external borders, and the portion of it above the spine is bent considerably outwards, so as to form an obtuse angle with the lower part. The vertebral border presents an anterior lip, a posterior lip, and an intermediate space. The anterior Up affords attachment to the Serratus magnus ; the posterior lip, to the Supraspinatus above the spine, the Infraspinatus below ; the interval between the two lips, to the Levator anguli scapulae above the triangular surface at the commencement of the spine, the Khomboideus minor to the edge of that surface ; the Khomboideus major being- attached by means of a fibrous arch, connected above to the lower part of the triangular surface at the base of the spine, and below to the lower part of the posterior border. Of the three angles, the superior, formed by the junction of the superior and internal borders, is thin, smooth, rounded, somewhat inclined outwards, and gives attachment to a few fibres of the Levator anguli scapulae muscle. The inferior angle, thick and rough, is formed by the union of the vertebral and axillary borders, its outer surface affording attachment to the Teres major and occasionally a few fibres of the Latissimus dorsi. The anterior angle is the thickest part of the bone, and forms what is called the head of the scapula. The head presents a shallow, pyriform, articular surface, the glenoid cavity {yXrjvr], a socket), whose longest diameter is from above downwards, and its direction outwards and forwards. It is broader below than above ; at its apex is a slight impression (the supra-glenoid tubercle), to which is attached the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. It is covered with cartilage in the recent state ; and its margins, slightly raised, give attachment to a fibro-cartilaginous structure, the glenoid ligament, by which its cavity is deepened. The neck of the scapula is the slightly depressed surface which surrounds the head; it is more distinct on the posterior than on the anterior surface, and below than above. In the latter situation it has, arising from it, a thick prominence, the coracoid process. The Coracoid Process, so called from its fancied resemblance to a crow's beak (Kopa^, a crow), is a thick, curved process of bone, which arises by a broad base from the upper part of the neck of the scapula ; it is directed at first upwards and inwards ; then, becoming smaller, it changes its direction, and passes forwards and outwards. The ascending portion, flattened from before backwards, presents2l8 THE SKELETON in front a smooth, concave surface, over which passes the Subscapnlaris muscle. The horizontal portion is flattenecl from above downwards ; its upper surface is convex and irregular, and gives attachment to the Pectoralis minor; its under surface is smooth ; its inner border is rough, and gives attachment to the Pectoralis minor ; its outer border is also rough for the coraco-acromial ligament, while the apex is embraced by the conjoined tendon of origin of the short head of the Biceps and of the Coraco-brachialis. At the inner side of the root of the coracoid process is a rough impression for the attachment of the conoid ligament; and running from it obliquely forwards and outwards, on the upper surface of the horizontal portion, an elevated ridge for the attachment of the trapezoid ligament. Structure.—In the head, processes, and all the thickened parts of the bone, the scapula is composed of cancellous tissue, while in the rest of its extent it is composed of a thin layer of dense, compact tissue. The centre and upper part of Fig. 196.—Plan of the develox)ment of the scapula. By seven centres. The epiphyses (except one for the coracoid process) appear from fifteen to seventeen years, and unite between twenty-tw^o and twenty-five years of age. the dorsum, but especially the former, are usually so thin as to be semi-transparent; occasionally the bone is found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles come into contact. Development (fig. 196).—By seven centres: one for the body, two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the vertebral border, and one for the inferior angle. Ossification of the body of the scapula commences about the second month of fcetal life, by the formation of an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone, immediately behind the glenoid cavity. This plate extends itself so as to form the chief part of the bone, the spine growing up from its posterior surface about the third month. At birth, the chief part of the scapula is osseous, only the coracoid and acromion processes, the posterior border, and inferior angle, being cartilaginous. AboutSCAPULA 219 the first year after birth, ossification talies place in the middle of the coracoid process, which usually becomes joined with the rest of the bone at the time when the other centres make their appearance. Between the fifteenth and seventeenth years, ossification of the remaining centres takes place in quick succession, and in the following order: first, near the base of the acromion and in the root of the coracoid process, the latter appearing in the form of a broad scale ; secondly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the posterior border ; thirdly, near the extremity of the acromion ; fourthly, in the posterior border. The acromion process, besides being formed of two separate nuclei, has its base formed by an extension into it of the centre of ossification which belongs to the spine, the extent of w^hich varies in different cases. The two separate nuclei unite, and then join wdth the extension carried in from the spine. These various epiphyses become joined to the bone between the ages of twenty-two and twenty- five years. Sometimes failure of union between the acromion process and spine occurs, the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation; in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone. Very often, in addition to these, a minute epiphysis appears at the margin of the glenoid cavity. Articulations.—With the humerus and clavicle. Attachment of Muscles.—To seventeen : to the anterior surface, the Subscapu- laris; posterior surface, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus; spine. Trapezius, Deltoid ; superior border, Omo-hyoid; vertebral border, Serratus magnus, Levator anguli scapulae, Ehomboideus minor and major; axillary border, Triceps, Teres minor. Teres major ; glenoid cavity, long head of the Biceps; coracoid process, short head of the Biceps, Coraco-brachialis, Pectoralis minor; and to the inferior angle occasionally a few fibres of the Latissimus dorsi. Surface Form.—The only parts of the scapula which are truly subcutaneous are the spine and acromion process, but, in addition to these, the coracoid process, the internal or vertebral border and inferior angle, and, to a less extent, the axillary border, may be defined. The acromion process and spine of the scapula are easily felt throughout their entire length, forming, with the clavicle, the arch of the shoulder. The acromion can be ascertained to be connected to the clavicle at the acroniio-clavicular joint by running the finger along it, its position being often indicated by an irregularity or bony outgrowth from the clavicle close to the joint. The acromion can be felt forming the point of the shoulder, and from this can be traced backwards to join the spine of the scapula. The place of junction is usuaUy denoted by a prominence, which is sometimes called the angle. From here the spme can be felt as a prominent ridge of bone, marked on the surface as an oblique depression, which becomes less and less distinct and terminates a little external to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Its termination is usually indicated by a slight dimple in the skin, on a level with the interval between the third and fourth dorsal spines. Below this point the vertebral border of the scapula may be traced, running downwards and outwards, and thus diverging from the vertebral spines, to the inferior angle of the bone, which can be recognised, although covered by the Latissimus dorsi muscle. From this angle the axillary border can usually be traced through its thick muscular covering, forming, with the muscles, the posterior fold of the axiUa. The coracoid process may be felt about an inch below the junction of the middle and outer third of the clavicle. Its position is indicated on the surface of the body b}^ a slight depression, which corresponds to the interval between the Pectoralis major and Deltoid muscles. When the arms are hangmg by the side, the upper angle of the scapula corresponds to the upper border of the second rib or the interval between the first and second dorsal spines, the inferior angle to the upper border of the eighth rib or the interval between the seventh and eighth dorsal spines. Surgical Anatomy.—Fractm^es of the body of the scapula are rare, owing to the mobility of the bone, the thick layer of muscles by which it is encased on both sm^faces, and the elasticity of the ribs on which it rests. Fracture of the neck of the bone is also micommon. The most frequent course of the fi^acture is from the suprascapular notch to the infra- glenoid tubercle, and it derives its principal interest fi-om its simidation to a subglenoid dislocation of the humerus. The diagnosis can be made by noting the alteration in the position of the coracoid process. A fi'actm-e of the neck external to and not including the coracoid process is said to occm", but it is exceedin^^ly doubtfid whether sneh an accident ever takes place. The acromion process is more frequently broken than ;ui\- other part of the bone, and there is sometimes, in yomig subjects, a separation of the epipiiysis. It isTHE SKELETOX 220 believed that many of the cases of supposed fracture of the acromion, with fibrous union, which have been found on post-mortem examination are really cases of imperfectly united epiph3'sis. Sir Astley Cooper believed that most fractures of this bone united by fibroiis tissue, and the cause of this mode of union was the difficulty there was in keepino' the fractured ends in constant apposition. The coracoid process is occasionally broken olf, either from direct violence or perhaps, rarely, from muscular action. Tmnours of various kinds grow from the scapula. Of the innocent form of tumours probablj' the osteomata are the most common. "When this grows from the venter of the scaprda, as it sometimes does, it is of the compact v ariety, such as usually grows from membrane-formed bones, as the bones of the skull. This would appear to afford evidence that this portion of the bone is formed from membrane, and not like the rest of the bone from cartilage. Sarcomatous tmnoiu-s sometimes grow h'om the scapula and ma^' necessitate remo^■al of the bone, with or without amputation of the upper limb. The bone may be excised by a T incision and the flaps being reflected, the removal is commejiced from the posterior or vertebral border, so that the subscapular v essels which lie along the axillary border are among the last structures divided, and can be at once secured. The Humerus The Humerus is the longest and largest bone of the upper extremity ; it presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity is the largest part of the bone; it presents a rounded liead, joined to the shaft by a constricted portion, called the neck, and two other eminences, the greater and lesser tuberosities (fig. 197). The head, nearly hemispherical in form,* is directed upwards, inwards, and a little backw^ards, and articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula; its surface s smooth, and coated with cartilage in the recent state. The circumfereuce of its articular surface is slightly constricted, and is termed the anatomical neck, in contradistinction to the constriction which exists below the tuberosities. The latter is called the surgical neck, from its often being the seat of fracture. It should be remembered, however, that fracture of the anatomical neck does sometimes, though rarely, occur. The anatomical neck is obliquely directed, forming an obtuse angle with the shaft. It is more distinctly marked in the lower half of its circumference than in the upper half, where it presents a narrow groove, separating the head from the tuberosities. Its circumference affords attachment to the capsular ligament, and is perforated by numerous vascular foramina. The greater tuberosity is situated on the outer side of the head and lesser tuberosity. Its upper surface is rounded and marked by three fiat facets, separated by two slight ridges : the anterior facet gives attachment to the tendon of the Supraspinatus ; the middle one to the Infraspinatus ; the posterior facet, and the shaft of the bone below it, to the Teres minor. The outer surface of the great tuberosity is convex, rough, and continuous with the outer side of the shaft. The lesser tuberosity is more prominent, although smaller, than the greater : it is situated in front of the head, and is directed inwards and forwards. Its summit presents a prominent facet for the insertion of the tendon of the Sub- scapularis muscle. The tuberosities are separated from one another by a deep groove, the bicipital groove, so called from its lodging the long tendon of the Biceps muscle, with which runs a branch of the anterior circumflex artery. It commences above between the two tuberosities, passes obliquely downwards and a little inwards, and terminates at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone. It is deep and narrow at the commencement, and becomes shallow and a little broader as it descends. Its borders are called, respectively, the anterior and posterior bicijjital ridges, and form the upper part of the anterior and internal borders of the shaft of the bone. In the recent state it is covered with * Though the head is nearlj'^ hemispherical in form, its margin, as Sir G. Humj)hry has shown, is by no means a true circle. Its greatest measurement is, from the top of the bicipital groove in a direction downwards, inwards, and backwards. Hence it follows that the greatest elevation of the arm can be obtained by rolling the articular surface in this direction—that is to say, obliquely upwards, outwards, and forwards.HUMERUS 22TTHE SKELETON 222 a thin layer of cartilage, lined by a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint, and receiyes the tendon of insertion of the Latissimus dorsi muscle. The Shaft of the humerus is almost cylindrical in the upper half of its extent, prismatic and flattened below, and presents three borders and three surfaces for examination. The anterior border runs from the front of the great tuberosity above to the coronoid depression below, separating the internal from the external surface. Its upper part is very prominent and rough, and forms the outer lip of the bicipital groove. It is sometimes called the anterior bicipital ridge, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the Pectoralis major. About its centre it forms the anterior boundary of the rough deltoid impression; below, it is smooth and rounded, affording attachment to the Brachialis anticus. The external border runs from the back part of the greater tuberosity to the external condyle, and separates the external from the posterior surface. It is rounded and indistinctly marked in its upper half, serving for the attachment of the lower part of the insertion of the Teres minor, and below this of the external head of the Triceps muscle ; its centre is traversed by a broad but shallow, oblique depression, the mjisculo-spiral groove ; its lower part is marked by a i^rominent, rough margin, a little curved from behind forwards, the external condyloid ridge, which presents an anterior lip for the attachment of the Supinator longus above, and Extensor carpi radialis longior below, a posterior lip for the Triceps, and an interstice for the attachment of the external intermuscular septum. The internal border extends from the lesser tuberosity to the internal condyle. Its upper third is marked by a prominent ridge, forming the posterior lip of the bicipital groove, and gives attachment to the tendon of the Teres major. About its centre is a rough ridge for the attachment of the Coraco-brachialis, and just below this is seen the entrance of the nutrient canal, directed downwards. Some- times there is a second canal higher up, which takes a similar direction. The inferior third of this border is raised into a slight ridge, the internal condyloid ridge, which becomes very prominent below ; it presents an anterior lip for the attachment of the Brachialis anticus, a posterior lip for the internal head of the Triceps, and an intermediate space for the internal intermuscular septum. The external surface is directed outwards above, where it is smooth, rounded, and covered by the Deltoid muscle ; forwards and outwards below, where it is slightly concave from above downwards, and gives origin to part of the Brachialis anticus muscle. About the middle of this surface is seen a rough, triangular impression for the insertion of the Deltoid muscle ; and below it the musculo-spiral groove, directed obliquely from behind, forwards, and downwards, and transmitting the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The internal surface, less extensive than the external, is directed inwards above, forwards and inwards below ; at its upper part it is narrow, and forms the floor of the bicipital groove : to it is attached the Latissimus dorsi. The middle part of this surface is slightly rough for the attachment of some of the fibres of the tendon of insertion of the Coraco-brachialis; its lower part is smooth, concave, and gives attachment to the Brachialis anticus muscle.* * A small, hook-shaped process of bone, varying from to ^ of an inch in length, is not nnfreqnently found projecting from the inner surface of the shaft of the humerus two inches above the internal condyle. It is curved downwards, forwards, and inwards, and its pointed extremity is connected to the internal border, just above the inner condyle, by a ligament or fibrous band, completing an arch, through which the median nerve and brachial artery pass, when these structures deviate from their usual course. Sometimes the nerve alone is transmitted throiTgh it, or the nerve may be accompanied by the ulnar artery, in cases of high division of the brachial. A well-marked »roove is usually found behind the process, in which the nerve and artery are lodged. This space is analogous to the supracondvloid foramen in many animals, and probably serves in them to protect the nerve and artery from compression during the contraction of the muscles in this region. A detailed account of this process is given by Dr. Struthers, in his Anatomical a7id Physiological Observations, p. 202. An accessory portion of theHUMERUS The posterior surface (fig. 198) ap- pears somewhat twisted, so that its upper part is directed a Httle inwards, its lower part baclnvards and a Httle outwards. Nearly the whole of this surface is covered by the external and internal heads of the Triceps, the former of which is attached to its upper and outer part, the latter to its inner and hack part, the two being- separated by the musculo-spiral groove. The Lower Extremity is flattened from before backwards, and curved slightly forwards ; it terminates below in a broad, articular surface, which is divided into two parts by a slight ridge. Projecting on either side are the external and internal condyles. The articular surface extends a little lower than the condyles, and is curved slightly forwards, so as to occupy the more anterior part of the bone ; its greatest breadth is in the transverse dia- meter, and it is obliquely directed, so that its inner extremity occupies a lower level than the outer. The outer portion of the articular surface presents a smooth, rounded eminence, which has received the name of the capitellum, or radial head of the humerus ; it articulates with the cup- shaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone, not extending as far back as the other portion of the articular surface. On the inner side of this eminence is a shallow groove, in w^hich is received the inner margin of the head of the radius. Above the front part of the capitellum is seen a slight depres- sion, which receives the anterior border of the head of the radius, when the fore-arm is flexed. The inner portion of the ar- ticular surface, the trochlear, presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders. This surface is convex from before backwards, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower, and posterior parts of the bone. The external border, less prominent than the internal, corresponds to the interval between the radius and the ulna. The internal border is thicker, more prominent, and conse- quently of greater length, than the ex- ternal. The grooved portion of the ar- ticular surface fits accurately within the Coraco-brachialis muscle is frequently con- nected with this process, according to Mr. J. Wood, Journal of Anat. and Phys. No. i, Nov. 1866, p. 47.THE SKELETON 224 Fig. 199.—Plan of the development of the humerus. Bv seven centres.

Above the front part of the trochlear surface is seen a smaller depression, the corouoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the fore-arm. Above the back part of the trochlear surface is a deep, triangular depression, the olecranon fossa, in which is received the summit of the olecranon process in extension of the forearm. These fossae are separated from one another by a thin, transparent lamina of bone, which is sometimes perforated, forming the swpratrocliJear forai}ien \ their upper margins afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the elbow-joint, and they are lined, in the recent state, by the synovial membrane of this articulation. The articular surfaces, in the recent state, are covered with a thin layer of cartilage. The external condyle is a small, tubercular eminence, less prominent than the internal, curved a little forwards, and giving attachment to the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, and to a tendon common to the origin of some of the extensor and supinator muscles. The internal condyle, larger and more prominent than the external, is directed a little backwards : it gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament, to the Pronator radii teres, and to a tendon common to the origin of some of the flexor muscles of the forearm. The ulnar nerve runs in a groove at the back of the internal condyle, or between it and the olecranon process. These emin- ences are directly continuous above with the external and internal borders —i.e. the external and internal condy- loid ridges. The great prominence of the inner one renders it more liable to fracture. Structure.—The extremities consist of cancellous tissue, covered with a thin, compact layer ; the shaft is com- posed of a cylinder of compact tissue, thicker at the centre than at the ex- tremities, and hollowed out by a large medullary canal, which extends along its whole length. Development.—By seven, or occa- sionally eight, centres (fig. 199): one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the tuberosities, one for the radial head, one for the trochlear portion of the articular surface, and one for each condyle. The nucleus for the shaft appears near the centre of the bone in the eighth week, and soon extends to- wards the extremities. At birth the humerus is ossified nearly in its whole length, the extremities remaining car- tilaginous. At the beginning of the second year ossification commences in the head of the bone, and during the third year the centre for the tuberosities makes its appearance, usually by a single ossific point, but sometimes, according to Beclard, by one for each tuberosity, that for the lesser being small, and not appearing until the fifth year. By the sixth year the centres for the head and tuberosities have enlarged and become joined, so as to form a single large epiphysis. The lower end of the humerus is developed in the following manner :—At the end of the second year ossification commences in the radial portion of the Unites with shaft 1 f, at eighteenth year > '225 HUMERUS articular surface, and from this point extends inwards, so as to form the chief part of the articular end of the bone, the centre for the inner part of the articular surface not appearing until about the age of twelve. Ossification commences in the internal condyle about the fifth year, and in the external one not until about the thirteenth or fourteenth year. About sixteen or seventeen years, the outer condyle and both portions of the articulating surface (having already joined) unite with the shaft ; at eighteen years the inner condyle becomes joined, whilst the upper epiphysis, although the first formed, is not united until about the tAventieth year. Articulations.—With the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and with the ulna and radius. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-four: to the greater tuberosity, the Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, and Teres minor; to the lesser tuberosity, the Subscapularis ; to the anterior bicipital ridge, the Pectoralis major ; to the posterior bicipital ridge, the Teres major; to the bicipital groove, the Latissimus dorsi ; to the shaft, the Deltoid, Coraco-brachialis, Brachialis anticus, external and internal heads of the Triceps ; to the internal condyle, the Pronator radii teres, and common tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis, Palmaris longus. Flexor sublimis digitorum, and Flexor carpi ulnaris; to the external condyloid ridge, the Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radialis longior; to the external condyle, the common tendon of the Extensor carpi radialis brevior, Extensor communis digitorum. Extensor minimi digiti, Extensor carpi ulnaris, and Supinator brevis ; to the back of the external condyle, the Anconeus. Surface Form.—The humerus is almost entirely clothed by the muscles which surround it, and the only parts of this bone which are strictly subcutaneous are small portions of the internal and external condyles. In addition to these, the tuberosities and a part of the head of the bone can be felt under the skin and muscles by which they are covered. Of these the greater tuberosity forms the most prominent bony point of the shoulder, extending beyond the acromion process and covered by the Deltoid muscle. It influences materially the surface form of the shoulder. It is best felt while the arm is lying loosely by the side ; if the arm be raised, it recedes from under the finger. The lesser tuberosity, directed forwards and inwards, is to be felt to the inner side of the greater tuberosity, just below the acromio-clavicular joint. Between the two tuberosities lies the bicipital groove. This can be defined by placing the finger, and making firm pressure, just internal to the greater tuberosit^^; then, by rotating the humerus, the groove will be felt to pass under the finger as the bone is rotated. "With the arm abducted from the side, by pressing deeply in the axilla, the lower part of the head of the bone is to be felt. On each side of the elbow-jomt, and just above it, the internal and external condyles of the bone are to be felt. Of these the internal is the more prominent, but the ridge passing upwards from it, the internal condyloid ridge, is much less marked than the external, and, as a rule, is not to be felt. Occasionally, however, we find along this border the hook-shaped process mentioned above. The external condyle is most plainly to be seen during semiflexion of the forearm, and its position is indicated by a depression between the attachment of the adjacent muscles. From it is to be felt a strong bony ridge running up the outer border of the shaft of the bone. This is the external condyloid ridge ; it is concave forwards, and corresponds with the curved direction of the lower extremity of the humerus. Surgical Anatomy.—There are several points of surgical interest connected with the humerus. Fhst, as regards its development. The upper end, though the first to ossify, is the last to join the shaft, and the length of the bone is mainly due to growth from this upper epiphysis. Hence, in cases of amputation of the arm in young subjects, the humerus contmues to grow considerably, and the end of the bone which immediately after the operation was covered with a thick cushion of soft tissue begins to project, thinning the soft parts and rendering the stump conical. This may necessitate the removal of a couple of mches or so of the bone, and even after this operation a recurrence of the conical stump ma>' take place. There are several points of surgical interest m connection with fractures. First, as regard their causation; the bone may be broken by direct or indirect violence like the other long bones, but, in addition to this, it is probably more frequently fractured by muscular action than any other of this class of bone in the body. It is usually the shaft, just below the insertion of the deltoid, which is thus broken. I have seen the accident happen from throwing a stone, and in an apparently healthy adult from cutting a piece of hard ' cake tobacco ' on a table. In this latter case there was no disease of the bone that could be discovered. Fractm'es of the upper end may take place through the anatomical neck, through the surgical neck, or separation of the gi'eater tuberosity may occur. Fracture of the anatomical neck is a very rare accident; in fact, it is doubted by some Q226 THE SKELETON whether it ever occurs. These fractures are usually considered to be intracapsular, but they are probably partly within and parth' ^^■ithout the ca])sule. as the lower part of the capsule is inserted some little distance below the anatomical neck, while the upper part is attached to it. They may be impacted or non-impacted. In most cases there is little or no disj^lacement on account of the capsule, in whole or in part, remaining attached to the lower fi-agment. But occasionally a very remarkable alteration in position takes place ; the upper fragment turiis on its own axis, so that the cartilaginous surface of the head rests against the upper end of the lower fragment. AVhen the h-actured end is entirely separated from all its surroundings, its vascular supply nuist be entirely cut oft", and one would expect it, theoretically, to necrose. But this must be exceedingly rare, for Gurlt was unable to find a single authenticated case recorded. Separation of the upper epiphysis of the humerus sometimes occurs in the young subject, and is marked by a characteristic deformity, by which the lesion may be at once recognised. This consists in the jiresence of an abrupt projection at the front of the joint some short distance below the coracoid process, caused by the upper end of the lower fragment. In fractures of the shaft of the humerus the lesion may take place at any point, but appears to be more common in the lower than the upper part of the bone. The points of interest in connection with these fractures are (i) that the musculo-spiral nerve may be injured as it lies in the groove on the bone, or may become involved in the callus which is subsequently thrown out; and (2) the frecpiency of non-union. This is believed to be more common in the humerus than in any other bone, and various causes have been assigned for it. It would seem most probably to be due to the difficulty that there is in fixing the shoulder-joint and the upper fragment, and possibly also the elbow-joint and lower fragment also. Other causes which have been assigned for the non-union are : (i) that in attempting passive motion of the elbow-joint to overcome any rigidity which may exist, the movement does not take place at the articulation but at the seat of fi'acture; or that the patient, in consecjuence of the rigidity of the elbow, in attempting to flex or extend the forearm, moves the fragment and not the joint. (2) The presence of small portions of muscular tissue between the broken ends. (3) AVant of support to the elbow, so that the weight of the arm tends to drag the lower fragment away from the upper. An important distinction to make in fractures of the lower end of the humerus, is between those that iuAolve the joint and those which do not; the former are always serious, as they may lead to impairment of the utility of the limb. They include the T-shaped fractin-e and oblique fractures which involve the articular surface. The fractures A\hich do not involve the joint are the transverse above the cond^ies, and detachment of one or other condyle. Under the head of separation of the epijihysis two sei)arate injuries have been described. One where the whole of the four ossific centres which form the lower extremity of the bone are separated from the shaft; and secondly, where the articular portion is alone separated, the two condyles remaining attached to the shaft of the l)()ne. The epiphysial line between the sliaft and lower end runs across the bone just abo\'e the tips of the condyles, a point to be borne in mind in performing the operation of excision. Tumours originating from the humerus are of frequent occurrence. A not uncommon place for a chondroma to grow from is the shaft of the bone somewhere in the neighbour- hood of the insertion of the deltoid. Sarcomata fre(iuently grow from this bone. The Forearm is that portion of the upper extremity which is situated between the elbow and wrist. It is composed of two bones, the ulna and the radius. The Ulna The Ulna (figs. 200, 201), so called from its forming the elbow ((oXeVyy), is a long bone, prismatic in form, placed at the inner side of the forearm, parallel with the radius. It is the larger and longer of the two bones. Its upper extremity, of great thickness and strength, forms a large part of the articulation of the elbow- joint ; it diminishes in size from above downwards, its lower extremity being very small, and excluded from the wrist-joint by the interposition of an interarticular fibro-cartilage. It is divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, the strongest part of the bone, presents for examination two large, curved processes, the Olecranon process and the Coronoid process ; and two concave, articular cavities, the greater and lesser sigmoid cavities. The Olecranon Process {wXivrj, elboir ; Kpaviov, head) is a large, thick, curved eminence, situated at the upper and back part of the ulna. It is curved forwards at the summit so as to present a prominent tip, its base being contracted where it joins the shaft. This is the narrowest part of the upper end of the ulna, and, consequently, the most usual seat of fracture. The posterior surface of theULNA 227THE SKELETON 228 olecranon, directed backwards, is triangular, smooth, subcntaneons, and covered by a bursa. Its upper surface, directed upwards, is of a quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the attachment of the Triceps muscle ; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. Its anterior surface is smooth, concave, covered with cartilage in the recent state, and forms the upper and back part of the great sigmoid ca\ity. The lateral borders present a continuation of the same groove that was seen on the margin of the superior surface ; they serve for the attachment of ligaments—viz. the back part of the internal lateral ligament internally, the posterior ligament externally. To the inner border is also attached a part of the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; while to the outer border is attached the Anconeus. The Coronoid Process {Kop^vrj, anything Jiooked like a crow's beak) is a rough, triangular eminence of bone which projects horizontally forwards from the upper and front part of the ulna, forming the lower part of the great sigmoid cavity. Its base is continuous with the shaft, and of considerable strength ; so much so that fracture of it is an accident of rare occurrence. Its apex is pointed, slightly curved upwards, and received into the coronoid depression of the humerus in flexion of the forearm. Its upper surface is smooth, concave, and forms the lower part of the greater sigmoid cavity. The under surface is concave, and marked internally by a rough impression for the insertion of the Brachialis anticus. At the junction of this surface with the shaft is a rough eminence, the tubercle of the ulna, for the attachment of the oblique ligament. Its outer surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the lesser sigmoid cavity. The inner surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment of part of the internal lateral ligament. At the front part of this surface is a small, rounded eminence for the attachment of one head of the Flexor sublimis digitorum ; behind the eminence, a depression for part of the origin of the Flexor profundus digitorum ; and, descending from the emin- ence, a ridge, which gives attachment to one head of the Pronator radii teres. Generally, the Flexor longus pollicis arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle of muscular fibres. The Greater Sigmoid Cavity, so called from its resemblance to the old shape of the Greek letter ^, is a semilunar depression of large size, formed by the olecranon and coronoid processes, and serving for articulation with the trochlear surface of the humerus. About the middle of either lateral border of this cavity is a notch, which contracts it somewhat, and serves to indicate the junction of the two processes of which it is formed. The cavity is concave from above downwards, and divided into two lateral parts by a smooth, elevated ridge which runs from the summit of the olecranon to the tip of the coronoid process. Of these two portions, the internal is the larger, and is slightly concave transversely; the external portion is convex above, slightly concave below. The articular surface, in the recent state, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage. The Lesser Sigmoid Cavity is a narrow, oblong, articular depression, placed on the outer side of the coronoid process, and serving for articulation with the head of the radius. It is concave from before backwards; and its extremities, which are prominent, serve for the attachment of the orbicular ligament. In the recent state, it is covered with a thin layer of cartilage. The Shaft, at its upper part, is prismatic in form, and curved from behind forwards, and from without inwards, so as to be convex behind and externally; its central part is quite straight ; its lower part rounded, smooth, and bent a little outwards ; it tapers gradually from above downwards, and presents for examination three borders, and three surfaces. The anterior border commences above at the prominent inner angle of the coro- noid process, and terminates below in front of the styloid process. It is well marked above, smooth and rounded in the middle of its extent, and affords attachment to the Flexor profundus digitorum : its lower fourth, marked off from the rest of the border by the commencement of an oblique ridge on the anterior surface, serves229 ULNATHE SKELETON 230 for the attachment of the Pronator quadratns. It separates the anterior from the internal surface. The posterior border commences above at the apex of the triangular sub- cutaneous surface at the back part of the olecranon, and terminates below at the back part of the styloid process ; it is well marked in the upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis common to the Flexor carpi ulnaris, the Extensor carpi ulnaris, and the Flexor profundus digitorum muscles; its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. This border separates the internal from the posterior surface. The external or interosseous border commences above by two lines, which con- verge one from each extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity, enclosing between them a triangular space for the attachment of part of the Supinator brevis, and terminates below at the middle of the. head of the ulna. Its two middle fourths are very pro- minent, its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. This border gives attachment to the interosseous membrane, except along its upper fourth, and separates the anterior from the posterior surface. The anterior surface, much broader above than below, is concave in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and affords attachment to the Flexor profundus digi- torum ; its lower fourth, also concave, to the Pronator quadratus. The lower fourth is separated from the remaining portion of the bone by a prominent ridge, directed obliquely from above downwards and inwards ; this ridge (the oblique or Pronator ridge) marks the extent of attachment of the Pronator quadratus above. At the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone is the nutrient canal, directed obliquely upwards and inwards. The posterior surface, directed backwards and outwards, is broad and concave above, somewhat narrower and convex in the middle of its course, narrow, smooth, and rounded below. It presents, above, an oblique ridge, which runs from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity, downwards to the posterior border ; the triangular surface above this ridge receives the insertion of the Anconeus muscle, whilst the ridge itself affords attachment to the Supinator brevis. The surface of bone below this is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the ■perpendicular line, into two parts : the internal part is smooth, concave, and gives origin to (occasionally is merely covered by) the Extensor carpi ulnaris ; the external portion, wider and rougher, gives attachment from above downwards to part of the Supinator brevis, the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the Extensor longus pollicis, and the Extensor indicis muscles. The internal surface is broad and concave above, narrow and convex below. It gives attachment by its upper three-fourths to the Flexor profundus digitorum muscle : its lower fourth is subcutaneous. The Lower Extremity of the ulna is of small size, and excluded from the arti- culation of the wrist-joint. It presents for examination two eminences, the outer and larger of which is a rounded, articular eminence, termed the head of the ulna; the inner, narrower and more projecting, is a non-articular eminence, the styloid process. The head presents an articular facet, part of which, of an oval form, is directed downwards, and articulates with the upper surface of the interarticular fibro-cartilage which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed outwards, is narrow, convex, and received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius. The styloid process projects from the inner and back part of the bone, and descends a little lower than the head, terminating in a rounded summit, which affords attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. The head is separated from the styloid process by a depression for the attachment of the triangular interarticular fibro-cartilage; and behind, by a shallow groove for the passage of the tendon of the Extensor carpi ulnaris. Structure.—Similar to that of the other long bones. Development.—By three centres : one for the shaft, one for the inferior extre- mity, and one for the olecranon (fig. 202). Ossification commences near the middle of the shaft about the eighth week, and soon extends through the greater part of231 RADIUS the bone. At birth the ends are cartilaginous. About the fourth year, a separate osseous nucleus appears in the middle of the head, which soon extends into the styloid process. About the tenth year, ossific matter appears in the olecranon near its extremity, the chief part of this process being formed from an extension of the shaft of the bone into it. At about the sixteenth year, the upper epiphysis becomes joined, and at about the twentieth year the lower one. Articulations.—-With the humerus and radius. Attachment of Muscles.—To sixteen : to the olecranon, the Triceps, Anconeus, and one head of the Flexor carpi ulnaris. To the coronoid process, the Brachialis anticus. Pronator radii teres, Flexor sub- limis digitorum, and Flexor profundus digitorum; generally also the Flexor longus poUicis. To the shaft, the Flexor profundus digitorum. Pronator quadratus. Flexor carpi ulnaris, Extensor carpi ulnaris, Anconeus, Supinator brevis, Ex- tensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Extensor longus pollicis, and Extensor indicis. Surface Form,—The most prominent part of the ulna on the surface of the body is the olecranon process, which can always be felt at the back of the elbow-joint. When the forearm is flexed, the upper triangular sur- face can be felt, directed backwards ; during extension it recedes into the olecranon fossa, and the contracting fibres of the triceps prevent its being perceived. At the back of the olecranon is the smooth, triangular, subcutaneous surface, which below is continuous with the jjosterior border of the shaft of the bone ; this is to be felt in every position of the joint. During extension, the upper border of the olecranon is slightly above the level of the internal condyle, and the process itself is nearer to this condyle than the outer one. Eimning down the back of the forearin, h'om the apex of the triangular surface which forms the posterior surface of the olecranon, is a prominent ridge of bone, the posterior border of the ulna. This is to be felt throughout the entire length of the shaft of the bone, from the olecranon above to the styloid process below. As it passes down the forearm it pursues a sinuous course and inclines to the inner side, so that, though it is situated in the middle of the back of the limb above, it is on the inner side of the wrist at its termination. It becomes rounded otf in its lower third, and may be traced below to the small, subcutaneous surface of the styloid process. Internal to this border the lower fourth of the internal surface is to be felt. The styloid process is to be felt as a prominent tubercle of bone, continuous above with the posterior subcutaneous border of the ulna, and terminating below in a blunt apex, which lies a little internal, and behind, but on a level with, the wrist-joint. The styloid process is best felt when the hand is in the same line as the bones of the forearm, and in a position midway between supination and pronation. If the forearm is pronated while the finger is placed on the process, it will be felt to recede, and another prominence of bone will appear iust external and above it. This is the head of the ulna, which articulates with tiie lower end of the radius and the triangular interarticidar fibro-cartilage, and now projects between the tendons of the Extensor carpi ulnaris and the Extensor minimi digiti muscles. The Eadius The Radius (radius, a ray, or spoke of a tvheel) is situated on the outer side of the forearm, lying side by side with the ulna, which exceeds it in length and size. Its upper end is small, and forms only a small part of the elbow-joint; but its low^er end is large, and forms the chief part of the wrist. It is one of the long bones, prismatic in form, slightly curved longitudinally, and, like other long bones, has a shaft and two extremities. Fig. 202.—^Plan of the development of the ulna. By three centres. Olecranon Appears at '^"'"'^ shaft at tenth ijear sixtecatli, ijear Appears at- fourth year Joins shaft at twentieth year Inferior extremityTHE SKELETON 232 The Upper Extremity presents a head, neck, and tuberosity. The head is of a cyhndrical form, depressed on its upper surface into a shallow cup which articulates with the capitellum or radial head of the humerus. In the recent state it is covered with a layer of cartilage, which is thinnest at its centre. Around the circumference of the head is a smooth, articular surface, broad internally where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna ; narrow in the rest of its circumference, where it rotates within the orbicular ligament. It is coated with cartilage in the recent state. The head is supported on a round, smooth, and constricted portion of bone, called the neck, which presents, behind, a slight ridge, for the attachment of part of the Supinator brevis. Beneath the neck, at the inner and front aspect of the bone, is a rough eminence, the hicipital tuberosity. Its surface is divided into two parts by a vertical line—a posterior, rough portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the Biceps muscle ; and an anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed betAveen the tendon and the bone. The Shaft of the bone is prismoid in form, narrower above than below, and slightly curved, so as to be convex outwards. It presents three surfaces, separated by three borders. The anterior border extends from the lower part of the tuberosity above, to the anterior part of the base of the styloid process below. It separates the anterior from the external surface. Its upper third is very prominent ; and from its oblique direction, downwards and outwards, has received the name of the obliqzie line of the radius. It gives attachment, externally, to the Supinator brevis ; internally, to the Flexor longus pollicis, and between these to the Flexor sublimis digitorum. The middle third of the anterior border is indistinct and rounded. Its lower fourth is sharp, prominent, affords attachment to the Pronator quadratus, and terminates in a small tubercle, into which is inserted the tendon of the Supinator longus. The posterior border commences above, at the back part of the neck of the radius, and terminates below, at the posterior part of the base of the styloid process ; it separates the posterior from the external surface. It is indistinct above and below, but well marked in the middle third of the bone. The internal or interosseous border commences above, at the back part of the tuberosity, where it is rounded and indistinct, becomes sharp and prominent as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges, which descend to the anterior and posterior margins of the sigmoid cavity. This border separates the anterior from the posterior surface, and has the interosseous membrane attached to it throughout the greater part of its extent. The anterior surface is narrow and concave for its upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to the Flexor longus pollicis muscle ; it is broad and flat for its lower fourth, and gives attachment to the Pronator quadratus. A prominent ridge limits the attachment of the Pronator quadratus below, and between this and the inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the attachment of the anterior ligament of the wrist-joint. At the junction of the upper and middle third of this surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed obliquely upwards. The posterior surface is rounded, convex, and smooth in the upper third of its extent, and covered by the Supinator brevis muscle. Its middle third is broad, slightly concave, and gives attachment to the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis above, the Extensor brevis pollicis below. Its lower third is broad, convex, and covered by the tendons of the muscles, which subsequently run in the grooves on the lower end of the bone. The external surface is rounded and convex throughout its entire extent. Its upper third gives attachment to the Supinator brevis muscle. About its centre is seen a rough ridge, for the insertion of the Pronator radii teres muscle. Its lower part is narrow, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and Extensor brevis pollicis muscles. The Lower Extremity of the radius is large, of quadrilateral form, and provided with two articular surfaces—one at the extremity, for articulation with the carpus,RADIUS 233 and one at the inner side of the bone, for articulation with the uhia. The carpal articular surface is of triangular form, concave, smooth, and divided by a slight antero-posterior ridge into two parts. Of these, the external is large, of a triangular form, and articulates with the scaphoid bone; the inner, smaller and quadrilateral, articulates with the semilunar. The articular surface for the ulna is called the sigmoid cavity of the radius ; it is narrow, concave, smooth, and articulates with the head of the ulna. The circumference of this end of the bone presents three surfaces—an anterior, external, and posterior. The anterior surface, rough and irregular, affords attachment to the anterior ligament of the wrist-joint. The external surface is prolonged obliquely downwards into a strong, conical projection, the styloid j^i'ocess, which gives attachment by its base to the tendon of the Supinator longus, and by its apex to the external lateral ligament of the wrist- joint. The outer surface of this process is marked by a flat groove, which runs obliquely downwards and forwards, and gives passage to the tendons of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and the Extensor brevis poUicis. The posterior surface is convex, affords attachment to the posterior ligament of the wrist, and is marked by three grooves. Proceeding from without inwards, the first groove is broad, but shallow, and subdivided into two by a slightly elevated ridge : the outer of these two transmits the tendon of the Extensor carpi radialis longior, the inner the tendon of the Extensor carpi radialis brevior. The second, which is near the centre of the bone, is a deep but narrow groove, bounded on its outer side by a sharply defined ridge ; it is directed obliquely from above, downwards and outwards, and transmits the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis. The third, lying most internally, is a broad groove, for the passage of the tendons of the Extensor indicis and Extensor communis digitorum. Structure.—Similar to that of the other long bones. Development (fig. 203).—By three centres : one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. That for the shaft makes its appearance near the centre of the bone, soon after the development of the humerus commences. At birth the shaft is ossified, but the ends of the bone are cartilaginous. About the end of the second year, ossification com- mences in the lower epiphysis ; and about the fifth year, in the upper one. At the age of seventeen or eighteen the upper epiphysis becomes joined to the shaft; the lower epiphysis becoming- united about the twentieth year. Articulations.—With four bones : the humerus, ulna, scaphoid, and semilunar. Attachment of Muscles. — To nine: to the tuberosity, the Biceps ; to the oblique ridge, the Supinator brevis, Flexor sublimis digitorum, and Flexor longus pollicis; to the shaft (its anterior surface), the Flexor longus pollicis and Pronator quad- ratus ; (its posterior surface), the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and Extensor brevis pollicis; (its outer surface), the Pronator radii teres ; and to the styloid process, the Supinator longus. Surface Form.—Just below, and a little in front of, the posterior surface of the external condyle a part of the head of the radius may be felt, covered by the orbicular and external Fig. 203.—Plan of the development of the radius. By three centres. Appears at fifth_ year Head Unites tvith shaft abo2ct puberty Appears at second year Lo7ner extremity Unites ivith shaft about twentieth year234 THE SKELETON lateral ligaments. There is in this situation a little dimple in the skin, which is most visible when the arm is extended, and which marks the position of the head of the bone. If the finger is placed on this dimple, and the forearm pronated and siipinated, the head of the bone will be distinctly perceived rotating in the lesser sigmoid cavity. The upper half of the shaft of the radius cannot be felt, as it is surrounded by the fleshy bellies of the muscles arising from the external condyle. The lower half of the shaft can be readily examined, though covered by tendons and muscles and not strictly subcutaneous. If traced downwards, the shaft will be felt to terminate in a lozenge-shaped, convex surface on the outer side of the base of tlie styloid process. This is the only subcutaneous part of the bone, and from its lower extremity the apex of the styloid process will be felt bending inwards towards the wrist. About the middle of the posterior aspect of the lower extremity of the bone is a well-marked ridge, best 2)erceived when the hand is slightly Hexed on the wrist. It bounds the oblique groove on the posterior surface of the bone, through which the tendon of the Extensor longus poUicis runs, and serves to keep that tendon in its place. Surgical Anatomy.—The two bones of the forearm are more often broken together, than is either the radius or ulna separately. It is therefore convenient to consider the fractures of these two bones together in the first instance and subse(piently to mention the principal fractures which take place in each bone individually. These fractures may be produced by either direct or indirect violence, though more commonly by direct violence. "When indirect force is applied to the forearm the radius generally alone gives way, though both bones may suffer. The fracture from indirect force generally takes place somewhere about the middle of the bones, fracture from direct violence may occur at any part, more often, however, in the lower half of the bone. The fracture is usually transverse, but may be more or less oblique. A point of interest in connection with these fractures is the tendency that there is for the two bones to unite across the interosseous membrane ; the limb should therefore be put up in a position midway between supination and pronation, which is not only the most comfortable position, but also separates the bones most widely from each other and therefore diminishes the risk of the bones becoming united across the interosseous membrane. The splints, anterior and posterior, which are applied in these cases should be rather wider than the limb, so as to prevent any lateral pressure on the bones. For in these cases there is a greater liability to gangrene from the pressure of the splints than in other parts of the body. This is no doubt due principally to two causes : (i) the flexion of the forearm compressing to a certain extent the brachial artery and retarding the flow of blood to the limb; and (2) the superficial position of the two main arteries of the forearm in a part of their course, and their liability to be compressed by the splints. The special fractures of the ulna are :—(i) fracture of the olecranon. This may be caused by direct violence, falls on the elbow with the forearm flexed, or by muscular action by the sudden contraction of the triceps. The most common place for the fi^actm-e to occur is at the constricted portion where the olecranon joins the shaft of the bone, and the fracture may be either transverse or oblique; but any part may be broken, even a thin shell may be torn off. Fractures from direct violence are occasionally comminuted. The displace- ment is sometimes very slight, owing to the fibrous structures around the process not being torn. (2) Fractm-e of the coronoid process sometimes occurs as a complication of dis- location backwards of the bones of the forearm, but it is doubtful if it ever occurs as an uncomplicated injury. (3) Fractures of the shaft of the ulna may occur at nwy part, but usually take place at the middle of the bone or a little below it. They are almost always the result of direct violence. (4) The styloid process may be knocked off by direct violence. Fractures of the radius consist of (1) fractm-e of the head of the bone ; this generally occurs in conjimction with some other lesion, but may occur as an uncomplicated injury. (2) Fracture of the neck may also take place, but is generallN' complicated with otlier injury. (3) Fractures of the shaft of the radius are very common, and ma}' take place at any part of the bone. They may take place from either direct or indirect violence. (4) Tlie most important fracture of the radius is that of the lower end (Colles's fracture). The fracture is transverse, and generally takes place about an inch from the lower extremity. It is caused by falls on the palm of the hand, and is an injury of advanced life, occurring more frequently in the female than the mnle. In consequence of the manner in which the fracture is caused, the upper fragment l)ecomes driven into the lower, and nupaction is the result; or else the lower fragment becomes split up into two or more pieces, so that no fixation occm-s. Separation of the lower epiphysis of the radius may take place in the young. This injury and Colles's fracture may be distinguished from other injuries in this neighbourhood— especially dislocation, with which it is liable to be confounded—by observing the relative positions of the styloid processes of the ulna and radius. In the natural condition of parts, with the arm hanging by the side, the styloid process of the radius is on a lower level than that of the ulna, that is to say, nearer the ground. After fracture or separation of the epiphysis this process is on the same or higher level than that of the ulna, whereas it would be unaltered in position in dislocation.235 CAEPUS THE HAND The skeleton of the Hand is subdivided into three segments—the Carpus or wrist bones ; the Metacarpus or bones of the pahii ; and the Phalanges or bones of the fingers. The Carpus The bones of the Carpus (Kap-n-os, the tvrist), eight in number, are arranged in two rows. Those of the upper row, enumerated from the radial to the ulnar side, are the scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, and pisiform ; those of the lower row, enumerated in the same order, are the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform. Common Characters of the Carpal Bones Each bone (excepting the pisiform) presents six surfaces. Of these the anterior or palmar, and the posterior or dorsal are rough, for ligamentous attachment; the dorsal surface being the broader, except in the scaphoid and semilunar. The superior or proximal and inferior or distal are articular, the superior generally convex, the inferior concave ; and the internal and external are also articular when in contact with contiguous bones, otherwise rough and tubercular. The structure in all is similar, consisting of cancellous tissue enclosed in a layer of compact bone. Each bone is also developed from a single centre of ossification. Bones of the Upper Eov^ (figs- 204, 205) The Scaphoid (a-Ka<^77, a boat; etSos, like) is the largest bone of the first row. It has received its name from its fancied resemblance to a boat, being broad at one end, and narrowed like a prow at the opposite. It is situated at the upper and outer part of the carpus, its long axis being from above downwards, outwards, and forwards. The superior surface is convex, smooth, of triangular shape, and articulates with the lower end of the radius. The inferior surface, directed downwards, outwards, and backwards, is smooth, convex, also triangular, and divided by a slight ridge into two parts, the external of which articulates with the trapezium, the inner with the trapezoid. The posterior or dorsal surface presents a narrow, rough groove, which runs the entire breadth of the bone, and serves for the attachment of ligaments. The anterior or palmar surface is concave above, and elevated at its lower and outer part into a prominent, rounded tubercle, which projects forwards from the front of the carpus and gives attachment to the anterior annular ligament of the wrist. The external surface is rough and narrow, and gives attachment to the external lateral ligament of the wrist. The internal surface presents two articular facets ; of these, the superior or smaller one is flattened, of semilunar form, and articulates with the semilunar; the inferior or larger is concave, forming, with the semilunar bone, a concavity for the head of the os magnum. To ascertain to which side the bone belongs, hold it with the superior, or radial, convex, articular, surface upwards, and the posterior surface—i.e. the narrow, non-articular, grooved surface—towards you. The tubercle on the outer surface points to the side to which the bone belongs.* Articulations.—With five bones : the radius above, trapezium and trapezoid below, OS magnum and semilunar internally. The Semilunar {semi, half ; luna, moon) bone may be distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated in the centre of the upper row of the carpus, between the scaphoid and cuneiform. The superior surface, convex, * In these dkections each bone is supposed to be placed in its natural position—that is, such a position as it would occupy when the arm is hanging by the side, the forearm in a position of supination, the thumb being directed outwards and the palm of the- hand looking forwards.CAEPUS 237 smooth, and bounded by four edges, articulates with the radius. The inferior surface is deeply concave, and of greater extent from before backwards than trans- versely : it articulates with the head of the os magnum, and, by a long, narrow facet (separated by a ridge from the general surface), with the unciform bone. The anterior or palmar and posterior or dorsal surfaces are rough, for the attach- ment of ligaments, the former being the broader, and of somewhat rounded form. The external surface presents a narrow, flattened, semilunar facet for articulation with the scaphoid. The internal surface is marked by a smooth, quadrilateral facet, for articulation with the cui;eiform. Hold it with the convex articular surface for the radius upwards, and the narrowest non-articular surface towards you. The semilunar facet for the scaphoid will be on the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With five bones : the radius above, os magnum and unciform below, scaphoid and cuneiform on either side. The Cuneiform (cuneus, a iveclge; forma, likeness) may be distinguished by its pyramidal shape (os pyramidal), and by its having an oval, isolated facet for articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated at the upper and inner side of the carpus. The superior surface presents an internal, rough, non-articular portion, and an external or articular portion, which is convex, smooth, and articulates with the triangular interarticular fibro-cartilage of the wrist. The inferior surface, directed outwards, is concave, sinuously curved, and smooth for articulation with the unciform. The posterior or dorsal surface is rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The anterior or palmar surface presents, at its inner side, an oval facet, for articulation with the pisiform; and is rough externally, for ligamentous attachment. The external surface, the base of the pyramid, is marked by a flat, quadrilateral, smooth facet, for articulation with the semilunar. The internal surface, the summit of the pyramid, is pointed and roughened, for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. Hold the bone with the surface supporting the pisiform facet away from you, and the concavo-convex surface for the unciform downwards. The base of the wedge (i.e. the broad end of the bone) will be on the side to which it belongs. Articulations.—With three bones: the semilunar externally, the pisiform in front, the unciform below ; and with the triangular, interarticular fibro-cartilage which separates it from the lower end of the ulna. The Pisiform (pisum, a pea ; forma, likeness) may be known by its small size, and by its presenting a single articular facet. It is situated at the anterior and inner side of the carpus, is nearly circular in form, and presents on its posterior surface a smooth, oval facet, for articulation with the cuneiform. This facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior, border of the bone. The anterior or palmar surface is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the anterior annular ligament and to the Flexor carpi ulnaris and Abductor minimi digiti muscles. The outer and inner surfaces are also rough, the former being convex, the latter usually concave. Hold the bone with the posterior surface—that which presents the articular facet—towards you, in such a manner that the faceted portion of the surface is uppermost. The outer, convex surface will point to the side to which it belongs. Articulations.—With one bone, the cuneiform. Attachment of Muscles.—To two: the Flexor carpi ulnaris and Abductor minimi digiti; and to the anterior annular ligament. Bones of the Lower Eow (figs. 204, 205) The Trapezium (rpaTre^a, a table) is of very irregular form. It may be distin- guished by a deep groove, for the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis muscle. It is situated at the external and inferior part of the carpus, between the scaphoid and first metacarpal bone. The superior surface, concave and smooth, is directed upwards and inwards, and articulates with the scaphoid. The inferior surface,238 THE SKELETON Fig. 205.—Bones of the left hand. Pahnar surface. FLEXOR^ CARPJ ULNARIS rUEXOR BREVIS MINIMI DICITI FLEXOR OSSIS METACARPl MINIMI DICTTI rLEX. BREVIS & ABDUCTOR MINIMI DICITI PBOFONOOSCARPUS 239 directed downwards and inwards, is oval, concave from side to side, convex from before backwards, so as to form a saddle-shaped surface, for articulation with the base of the first metacarpal bone. The anterior or iKilmar surface is narrow and rough. At its upper part is a deep groove, running from above obliquely down- wards and inwards; it transmits the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis, and is bounded externally by a prominent ridge, the oblique ridge of the trapezium. This surface gives attachment to the Abductor pollicis. Flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and Flexor brevis pollicis muscles, and the anterior annular ligament. The 2^osterior or dorsal surface is rough. The external surface is also broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The internal surface presents two articular facets : the upper one, large and concave, articulates with the trapezoid; the lower one, narrow and flattened, with the base of the second metacarpal bone. Hold the bone with the saddle-shaped surface downwards and the grooved surface away from you. The prominent, rough, non-articular surface points to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—^With four bones : the scaphoid above, the trapezoid and second metacarpal bones internally, the first metacarpal below. Attachment of Muscles.—Abductor pollicis, Flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and part of the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Trapezoid is the smallest bone in the second row. It may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge forming the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar, surface; and by its having four articular surfaces touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. The su-perior surface, quadrilateral in form, smooth, and slightly concave, articulates with the scaphoid. The inferior surface articulates with the upper end of the second metacarpal bone ; it is convex from side to side, concave from before backwards, and subdivided, by an elevated ridge, into two unequal lateral facets. TYiq posterior oy dorsal and anterior or palmar surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments, the former being the larger of the two. The external surface, convex and smooth, articulates with the trapezium. The internal surface is concave and smooth in front, for articulation with the OS magnum ; rough behind, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Hold the bone with the larger, non-articular surface towards you, and the smooth, quadrilateral articular surface upwards. The convex, articular surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs.* Articulations.—With four bones : the scaphoid above, second metacarpal bone below, trapezium externally, os magnum internally. The Os Magnum is the largest bone of the carpus, and occupies the centre of the wrist. It presents, above, a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bones; a constricted portion or neck; and, below, the body. The superior surface is rounded, smooth, and articulates with the semilunar. The inferior surface is divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones, that for the third (the middle facet) being the largest of the three. The posterior or dorsal surface is broad and rough ; the anterior or palmar, narrow, rounded,, and also rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The external surface articulates with the trapezoid by a small facet at its anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Above this is a deep and rough groove, which forms part of the neck, and serves for the attachment of ligaments, bounded superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the scaphoid. The internal surface articulates with the unciform by a smooth, concave, oblong facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; and is rough in front, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Hold the bone with the broader, non-articular surface towards you, and the * Occasionally in a badly marked bone there is some difficulty in ascertaining to which side the bone belongs ; the following method will sometimes be found useful. Hold the bone with its broader, non articular surface upwards, so that its sloping border is directed towards you. The border will slope to the side to which the bone belongs.THE SKELETON 240 head upwards. The small, articular facet at the anterior inferior angle of the external surface will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With seven bones : the scaphoid and semilunar above ; the second, third, and fourth metacarpal below ; the trapezoid on the radial side ; and the unciform on the ulnar side. Attachment of Muscles.—Part of the Adductor obhquus poUicis. The Unciform (uncus, a hook; forma, likeness) may be readily distinguished by its wedge-shaped form, and the hook-like process that projects from its palmar surface. It is situated at the inner and lower angle of the carpus, with its base downwards, resting on the two inner metacarpal bones, and its apex directed upwards and outwards. The superior surface, the apex of the wedge, is narrow, convex, smooth, and articulates with the semilunar. The inferior surface articulates with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones, the concave surface for each being separated by a ridge, which runs from before backwards. The posterior or dorsal surface is triangular and rough, for ligamentous attachment. The anterior or pahnar surface presents, at its lower and inner side, a curved, hook-Hke process of bone, the miciform process, directed from the palmar surface forwards and out- wards. It gives attachment, by its apex, to the annular ligament; by its inner surface to the Flexor brevis minimi digiti and the Flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti; and is grooved on its outer side, for the passage of the Flexor tendons into the palm of the hand. This is one of the four eminences on the front of the carpus to which the anterior annular ligament is attached ; the others being the pisiform internally, the oblique ridge of the trapezium and the tuberosity of the scaphoid externally. The internal surface articulates with the cuneiform by an oblong facet, cut obliquely from above, downwards and inwards. The external surface articulates with the os magnum by its upper and posterior part, the remaining portion being rough, for the attachment of ligaments. Hold the bone with the hooked process away from you, and the articular surface, divided into two parts for the metacarpal bones, downwards. The concavity of the process will be on the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With five bones : the semilunar above, the fourth and fifth metacarpal below, the cuneiform internally, the os magnum externally. Attachment of Muscles.—To three : the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, the Flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti, the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; and to the anterior annular ligament. The Metacarpus The Metacarpal Bones are five in number : they are long, cyhndrical bones, presenting for examination a shaft and two extremities. Common Chakactees of the Metacarpal Bones The shaft is prismoid in form, and curved longitudinally, so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. It presents three surfaces: two lateral and one posterior» The lateral surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the Interossei muscles, and separated from one another by a prominent line. The posterior or dorsal surface presents in its distal half a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered, in the recent state, by the tendons of the Extensor muscles. This triangular surface is bounded by two lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on the dorsal aspect of either side of the digital extremity, and, running backwards, converge to meet together a little behind the centre of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface to the carpal extremity. This ridge separates two lateral, sloping surfaces for the attachment of the Dorsal interossei muscles.* To the tubercles on the digital extremities are attached the lateral ligaments of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. The carpal extremity, or base, is of a cuboidal form, and broader behind than * By these sloping surfaces the metacarpal bones of the hand may be at once differen- tiated from those of the foot.METACARPUS 241 in front: it articulates above with the carpus, and on each side with the adjoining metacarpal bones ; its dorsal and palmar surfaces are rough, for the attachment of tendons and ligaments. The digital extremity, or head, presents an oblong surface, flattened at each side ; it articulates with the proximal phalanx ; it is broader, and extends farther forwards, in front than behind, and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. On either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the lateral ligament of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The posterior surface, broad and flat, supports the Extensor tendons ; the anterior surface is grooved in the middle line for the passage of the Flexor tendons and marked on each side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface. Peculiar Characters of the Metacarpal Bones The metacarpal "bone of the thumb is shorter and wider than the rest, diverges to a greater degree from the carpus, and its palmar surface is directed inwards towards the palm. The shaft is flattened and broad on its dorsal aspect, and does not present the ridge which is found on the other metacarpal bones ; it is concave from before backwards, on its palmar surface. The carpal extremity, or base, presents a concavo-convex surface, for articulation with the trapezium; it has no lateral facets. The digital extremity is less convex than that of the other metacarpal bones, broader from side to side than from before backwards, and terminates anteriorly in a small articular eminence on each side, over which play two sesamoid bones. The side to which this bone belongs may be known by observing the little prominence which is situated on the outer or radial side of its posterior surface just above the base, for the tendon of the Extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis. If the bone is held with the palmar surface upwards and the base towards the student, the prominence will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Another means by which the side to which the bone belongs may be ascertained is by holding it in the position it occupies in the hand, with the carpal extremity upwards and the dorsal surface backwards ; the narrower, radial border will point to the side to which it belongs. The metacarpal bone of the index finger is the longest, and its base the largest, of the other four. Its carpal extremity is prolonged upwards and inwards, forming a prominent ridge. The dorsal and palmar surfaces of this extremity are rough, for the attachment of tendons and ligaments. It presents four articular facets : three on the upper aspect of the base ; the middle one of the three is the largest, concave from side to sidej convex from before backwards, for articulation with the trapezoid ; the external one is a small, flat, quadrilateral facet, for articulation with the trapezium ; the internal one on the summit of the ridge is long and narrow, for articulation with the os magnum. The fourth facet is on the inner or ulnar side of the extremity of the bone, and is for articulation with the third metacarpal bone. The side to which this bone belongs is indicated by the absence of the lateral facet on the outer (radial) side of its base, so that if the bone is placed with its base towards the student, and the palmar surface upwards, the side on which there is no lateral facet will be that to which it belongs. The metacarpal bone of the middle finger is a little smaller than the preceding; it presents a pyramidal eminence (the styloid process) on the radial side of its base (dorsal aspect), which extends upwards behind the os magnum. The carpal, articular facet is concave behind, flat in front, and articulates with theos magnum. On the radial side is a smooth, concave facet, for articulation with the second metacarpal bone, and on the ulnar side two small, oval facets, for articulation with the fourth metacarpal. The side to which this bone belongs is easily recognised by the styloid process on the radial side of its base. With the palmar surface uppermost, and the base towards the student, this process points towards the side to which the bone belongs. RTHE SKELETON 242 The metacarpal bone of the riiig-fing^er is shorter and smaller than the preceding, and its base small and quadrilateral; the carpal sm^face of the base presenting tAvo facets, for articulation with the unciform and os magnum. On the radial side are two oval facets, for articulation with the third metacarpal bone ; and on the ulnar side, a single concave facet, for the fifth metacarpal. If this bone is placed with the base towards the student, and the palmar surface upwards, the radial side of the base, w^hich has two facets for articulation with the third metacarpal bone, will be on the side to which it belongs. If, as sometimes hai:)pens in badly marked bones, one of these facets is indistinguishable, the side may be known by selecting the surface on which the larger articular facet is present. This facet is for the fifth metacarpal bone, and would therefore be situated on the ulnar side—that is, the one to which the bone does not belong. The metacarpal bone of the little finger presents on its base one facet, which is concavo-convex, and which articulates with the unciform bone, and one lateral, articular facet, which articulates with the fourth metacarpal bone. On its ulnar side is a prominent tubercle, for the insertion of the tendon of the Extensor carpi ulnaris. The dorsal surface of the shaft is marked by an oblique ridge, which extends from near the ulnar side of the upper extremity to the radial side of the lower. The outer division of this surface serves for the attachment of the Fourth dorsal interosseous muscle; the inner division is smooth, and covered by the Extensor tendons of the little finger. If this bone is placed with its base towards the student, and its palmar surface upwards, the side of the head which has a lateral facet will be that to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—Besides the phalangeal articulations, the first metacarpal bone articulates with the trapezium ; the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and third metacarpal bones ; the third with the os magnum, and second and fourth metacarpal bones ; the fourth with the os magnum, unciform, and third and fifth metacarpal bones ; and the fifth with the unciform and fourth metacarpal. The first has no lateral facets on its carpal extremity ; the second has no lateral facet on its radial side, but one on its ulnar side ; the third has one on its radial and two on its ulnar side ; the fourth has two on its radial and one on its ulnar side ; and the fifth has only one on its radial side. Attachment of Muscles.—To the metacarpal bone of the thumb, four : the Flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis, Flexor brevis pollicis, Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and First dorsal interosseous. To the second metacarpal bone, seven : the Flexor carpi radialis, Extensor carpi radialis longior, Adductor transversus pollicis, Adductor obliquus pollicis. First and Second dorsal interosseous, and First palmar interosseous. To the third, six : the Extensor carpi radialis brevior. Flexor carpi radialis, Adductor transversus pollicis. Adductor obliquus pollicis, and Second and Third dorsal interosseous. To the fourth, three : the Third and Fourth dorsal and Second palmar interosseous. To the fifth, five : the Extensor carpi ulnaris. Flexor carpi ulnaris, Flexor ossis metacarpi minimi digiti, Fourth dorsal and Third palmar interosseous. Phalanges The Phalanges (internodia) are the bones of the fingers ; they are fourteen in number, three for each finger, and two for the thumb. They are long bones, and present for examination a shaft and two extremities. The shaft tapers from above downwards, is convex posteriorly, concave in front from above downwards, flat from side to side, and marked laterally by rough ridges, which give attachment to the fibrous sheaths of the Flexor tendons. The metacarpal extremity or base, in the first row presents an oval, concave, articular surface, broader from side to side than from before backwards; and the same extremity in the other two rows, a double concavity, separated by a longitudinal median ridge, extending from before backwards. The digital extreviitics are smaller than the others, and terminate.243 SUEGICAL ANATOMY in the first and second rows, in two small, lateral condyles, separated by a slight groove ; the articular surface being prolonged farther forwards on the palmar than on the dorsal surface, especially in the first row. The Ungual Phalanges are convex on their dorsal, flat on their palmar surfaces ; they are recognised by their small size, and by a roughened, elevated surface of a horseshoe form on the palmar aspect of their ungual extremity, which serves to support the sensitive pulp of the finger. Articulations.—The first row with the metacarpal bones and the second row of phalanges ; the second row with the first and third ; the third with the second row. Attachment of Muscles.—To the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, five muscles : the Extensor brevis pollicis. Flexor brevis poUicis, Abductor pollicis, Adductor transversus and obliquus pollicis. To the second phalanx, two : the Flexor longus pollicis and the Extensor longus pollicis. To the base.of the first phalanx of the index finger, the First dorsal and the First palmar interosseous; to that of the middle finger, the Second and Third dorsal interosseous ; to that of the ring-finger, the Fourth dorsal and the Second palmar interosseous ; and to that of the little finger, the Third palmar interosseous, the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, and Abductor minimi digiti. To the second phalanges, the Flexor sublimis digitorum, Extensor communis digitorum, and, in addition, the Extensor indicis to the index finger, the Extensor minimi digiti to the little finger. To the third phalanges, the Flexor profundus digitorum and Extensor communis digitorum. Sarface Form.—On the front of the wrist are two subcutaneous eminences, one on the radial side, the larger and flatter, due to the tuberosity' of the scaphoid and the ridge on the trapezium ; the other, on the ulnar side, caused by the pisiform bone. The tubercle of the scaphoid is to be felt just below and in front of the apex of the styloid process of the radius. It is best perceived by extending the hand on the forearm. Immediately below is to be felt another prominence, better marked than the tubercle; this is the ridge on the trapezium, which gives attachment to some of the short muscles of the thumb. On the inner side of the front of the wrist the pisiform bone is to be felt, forming a small but prominent projection in this situation. It is some distance below the styloid process of the ulna, and may be said to be just below the level of the styloid process of the radius. The rest of the front of the carpus is covered by tendons and the annular ligament, and entirely concealed, with the exception of the hooked process of the unciform, which can only be made out with difficulty. The back of the carpus is convex and covered by the Extensor tendons, so that none of the posterior surfaces of the bones are to be felt, with the exception of the cuneiform on the inner side. Below the carpus the dorsal surface of the metacarpal bones, except the fifth, are covered by tendons, and are scarcely visible except in very thin hands. The dorsal surface of the fifth is, however, subcutaneous throughout almost its whole length, and is plainly to be perceived and felt. In addition to this, slightly external to the middle line of the hand, is a prominence, frequently well marked, but occasionally indistinct, formed by the base of the metacarpal of the middle finger. The heads of the metacarpal bones are plainly to be felt and seen, rounded in contour and standing out in bold relief under the skin, when the fist is clenched. It should be borne in mind that when the fingers are flexed on the hand, the articular surfaces of the first phalanges glide off the heads of the metacarpal bones on to their anterior surfaces ; so that the heads of these bones form the prominence of the knuckles and receive the force of any blow which may be given. The head of the third metacarpal bone is the most prominent, and receives the greater part of the shock of the blow. This boiie articulates with the os magnum, so that the concussion is carried through this bone to the scaphoid and semilunar, with which the head of the os magnum articulates, and by these bones is transferred to the radius, along which it may^ be carried to the capitellum of the humerus. The enlarged extremities of the phalanges are to be plainly felt: they form the joints of the fingers. When the digits are bent, the proximal phalanges of the joints form prominences, which in the joint between the first and second phalanges is slightly hollowed, in accordance with the grooved shape of their articular surfaces, whilst at the last row the prominence is flattened and square-shaped. In the palm of the hand the four inner metacarpal bones are covered by muscles, tendons, and the palmar fascia, and no part of them but their heads is to be distinguished. With regard to the thumb, on the dorsal aspect, the base of the metacarpal bone forms a prominence, below the styloid pro- cess of the radius; the shaft is to be felt, covered by tendons, terminating at its head in a flattened prominence, in front of which can be felt the sesamoid bones. Surgical Anatomy.—The carpal bones are little liable to fracture, except from extreme violence, when the parts are so comminuted as to necessitate amputation. Occasionally they are the seat of tubercular disease. The metacarpal bones and the phalanges are not R 2THE SKELETON imfrequently broken from direct violence. The first metacarpal bone is the one most com- monly fractm^ed, then the second, the fourth and the fifth, the third being the one least frequently broken. There are two diseases of the metacarpal bones and phalanges which require special mention on account of the frequency of their occurrence. One is tubercular dactylitis, consisting in a deposit of tubercular material in the medullary canal, expandmg the bone,'with subsequent caseation and resulting necrosis. The other is chondroma, which is perhaps more frequently found in connection with the metacarpal bones and phalanges than with any other bones. They are commonly multiple, and may sprmg either from the meduUary canal, or from the periosteum. Development of the Bones of the Hand The Carpal Bones are each developed by a single centre. At birth, they .are all cartilaginous. Ossification proceeds in the following order (fig. 206) : In the Fig. 206.—Plan of the development of the hand.

The Metacarpal Bones are each developed by tioo centres : one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, for the four inner metacarpal bones ; one for the shaft, and one for the base, for the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which in this respect resembles the phalanges.* Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the eighth or ninth week, and gradually proceeds to either end of the * Allen Thomson has demonstrated the fact that the first metacarpal bone is often developed from three centres; that is to say, there is a separate nucleus for the distal end.245 OS INNOMINATUM bone; about the third year the digital extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones, and the base of the first metacarpal, begin to ossify, and they unite about the twentieth year. The Phalanges are each developed by tioo centres: one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences in the shaft, in all three rows, at about the eighth week, and gradually involves the whole of the bone excepting the upper extremity. Ossification of the base commences in the first row between the third and fourth years, and a year later in those of the second and third rows. The two centres become united, in each row, between the eighteenth and twentieth years. Of the Lowee Extremity The Lower Extremity consists of three segments, the thigh, leg, and foot, which correspond to the arm, forearm, and hand in the upper extremity. It is connected to the trunk through the os innominatum, or hip-bone, which forms the pelvic girdle. The Os Innominatum The Os Innominatum (in, not; nomino, I name), or nameless hone, so called from bearing no resemblance to any known object, is a large, irregularly shaped, flat bone, constricted in the centre and expanded above and below. With its fellow of the opposite side, it forms the sides and anterior wall of the pelvic cavity. In young subjects it consists of three separate parts, which meet and form the large, cup-like cavity situated near the middle of the outer surface of the bone ; and, although in the adult these have become united, it is usual to describe the bone as divisible into three portions-—the ilium, the ischium, and the os pubis. The ilium, so called from its supporting the flank {ilia), is the superior, broad and expanded portion which runs upwards from the upper and back part of the acetabulum, and forms the prominence of the hip. The ischium (lo-xtov, the hip) is the inferior and strongest portion of the bone ; it proceeds downwards from the acetabulum, expands into a large tuberosity, and then, curving upwards, forms, with the descending ramus of the os pubis, a large aperture, the obturator foramen. The OS pubis is that portion which runs horizontally inwards from the inner side of the acetabulum for about two inches, then makes a sudden bend, and descends for about one inch: it forms the front of the pelvis, supports the external organs of generation, and has received its name from being covered with hair. The Ilium presents for examination two surfaces—an external and an internal— a crest, and two borders—an anterior and a posterior. External Surface or Dorsum of the Ilium (fig. 207).—The back part of this surface is directed backwards, downwards, and outwards; its front part forwards, downwards, and outwards. It is smooth, convex in front, deeply concave behind ; bounded above by the crest, below by the upper border of the acetabulum ; in front and behind, by the anterior and posterior borders. This surface is crossed in an arched direction by three semicircular lines—the superior, middle, and inferior curved lines. The superior curved line, the shortest of the three, commences at the crest, about two inches in front of its posterior extremity; it is at first dis- tinctly marked, but as it passes downwards and outwards to the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic notch, where it terminates, it becomes less marked, and is often altogether lost. Behind this line is a narrow semilunar surface, the upper part of which is rough and affords attachment to part of the Gluteus maximus; the lower part is smooth and has no muscular fibres attached to it. The middle curved line, the longest of the three, commences at the crest, about an inch behind its anterior extremity, and, taking a curved direction downwards and backwards, terminates at forming a distinct epiphysis visible at the age of seven or eight years. He also states that there are traces of a proximal epiphysis in the second metacarpal bone. Journal of A7iato'tny, 1869,246 THE SKELETON the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic notch. The space between the superior and middle curved Unes and the crest is concave, and affords attachment to the Gkiteus medius muscle. Near the central part of this hne may often be observed the orifice of a nutrient foramen. The inferior curved Hne, the least distinct of the three, commences in front at the upper part of the anterior inferior spinous process, and, taking a curved direction backwards and downwards, terminates at the middle of the great sacro-sciatic notch. The surface of bone included between the middle Fig. 207.—Eight os innominatum. External siu-face. Crest of ilium and inferior curved hnes is concave from above downwards, convex from before backwards, and affords attachment to the Gluteus minimus muscle. Beneath the inferior curved hne, and corresponding to the upper part of the acetabulum, is a roughened surface (sometimes a depression), to which is attached the reflected tendon of the Rectus femoris muscle. The Internal Surface (fig. 208) of the iHum is bounded above by the crest; below it is continuous with the pelvic surfaces of the os pubis and ischium, a faintOS INN05IINATUM 247 Ime only indicating the place of union; and before and be nnd it 1. bo^-^^d by he anterior and posterior borders.

Internal surface. COMPRESSOR URETHR/E Cms penis TRANSVERSUS PERWffil ERECTOR PENIS muscle. Behind the iliac fossa is a rough surface, divided into two portions, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior or auricular portion so called from its resemblance in shape to the ear, is coated with cartilage m the recent state, and articulates with a surface of similar shape on the side of the sacrum. The Po^tei «r portion is rough, for the attachment of the posterior sacro-ihao ligaments and lor a part of the origin of the Erector spin*. i , „„™od The crest of the ilium is convex in its general outline and sinuously curved,THE SKELETON 248 being bent inwards anteriorly, outwards posteriorly. It is longer in the female than in the male, very thick behind, and thinner at the centre than at the extre- mities. It terminates at either end in a prominent eminence, the an terior superior and posterior superior spinous process. The surface of the crest is broad, and divided into an external lip, an internal lip, and an intermediate space. To the external lip is attached the Tensor vaginpe femoris, Obliquus externus abdominis, and Latissimus dorsi, and by its whole length the fascia lata ; to the space between the lips, the Internal oblique; to the internal lip, the Transversalis, Quadratus lumborum, and Erector spinje, the Iliacus, and the fascia iliaca. The anterior border of the ilium is concave. It presents two projections, separated by a notch. Of these, the uppermost, situated at the junction of the crest and anterior border, is called the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, the outer border of which gives attachment to the fascia lata, and the origin of the Tensor vaginae femoris; its inner border, to the Iliacus; whilst its extremity affords attachment to Poupart's ligament and the origin of the Sartorius. Beneath this eminence is a notch which gives attachment to the Sartorius muscle, and across which passes the external cutaneous nerve. BeloAV the notch is the anterior inferior spinous process, which terminates in the upper lip of the acetabulum; it gives attachment to the straight tendon of the Eectus femoris muscle and the ilio-femoral Ligament. On the inner side of the anterior inferior spinous process is a broad, shallow groove, over which passes the Iliacus muscle. This groove is bounded internally by an eminence, the ilio-pectineal, which marks the point of union of the ilium and os pubis. The posterior border of the ilium, shorter than the anterior, also presents two projections separated by a notch, posterior superior and the posterior inferior spinous processes. The former corresponds with that portion of the posterior surface of the ilium which serves for the attachment of the oblique portion of the sacro-iliac ligaments and the Multifidus spinae; the latter to the auricular portion which articulates with the sacrum. Below the posterior inferior spinous process is a deep notch, the great s aero-sciatic. The Ischium forms the lower and back part of the os innominatum. It is divisible into a thick and solid portion, the body ; a large, rough eminence, on which the body rests in sitting, the tuberosity ; and a thin, ascending part, the ramus. The body, somewhat triangular in form, presents three surfaces, external, internal, and posterior ; and three borders, external, internal, and posterior. The external surface corresponds to that portion of the acetabulum formed by the ischium ; it is smooth and concave, and forms a little more than two-fifths of the acetabular cavity; its outer margin is bounded by a prominent rim or lip, the external border, to which the cotyloid fibro-cartilage is attached. Below the acetabulum, between it and the tuberosity, is a deep groove, along which the tendon of the Obturator externus muscle runs, as it passes outwards to be inserted into the digital fossa of the femur. The internal surface is smooth, concave, and enters into the formation of the lateral boundary of the true pelvic cavity. This surface is perforated by two or three large, vascular foramina, and affords attachment to part of the Obturator internus muscle. The posterior surface is quadrilateral in form, broad and smooth. Below, where it joins the tuberosity, it presents a groove continuous with that on the external surface, for the tendon of the Obturator externus muscle. The lower edge of this groove is formed by the tuberosity of the ischium, and affords attachment to the Gemellus inferior muscle. This surface is limited, in front, by the margin of the acetabulum ; behind, by the posterior border ; it supports the Pyriformis, the two Gemelli, and the Obturator internus muscles, in their passage outwards to the great trochanter. The external border forms the prominent rim. of the acetabulum, and separates the posterior from the external surface. To it is attached the cotyloid fibro-cartilage. The internal border is thin, and forms the outer circumference of the obturator foramen. The posterior border of the body of the ischium presents, a little below the centre, a thin and pointed, triangular eminence, the spine of the ischium, more or less elongated in249 OS INNOMINATUM different subjects ; its external surface gives attachment to the Gemellus superior, its internal surface to the Coccygeus and Levator ani; whilst to the pointed extremity is connected the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. Above the spine is a notch of large size, the great sacro-sciatic, converted into a foramen by the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament; it transmits the Pyriformis muscle, the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve passing out of the pelvis above the muscle ; the sciatic vessels, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, the internal pudic vessels and nerve, and muscular branches from the sacral plexus below it. Below the spine is a smaller notch, the lesser sacro-sciatic; it is smooth, coated in the recent state with cartilage, the surface of which presents numerous markings corresponding to the subdivisions of the tendon of the Obturator internus, which winds over it. It is converted into a foramen by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and transmits the tendon of the Obturator internus, the nerve which supplies that muscle, and the internal pudic vessels and nerve. The tuberosity presents for examination three surfaces : external, internal, and inferior. The external surface is quadrilateral in shape and rough for the attach- ment of muscles. It is bounded above by the groove for the tendon of the Obturator externus ; in front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen, and below it is continuous with the ramus of the bone ; behind, it is bounded by a prominent margin which separates it from the inferior surface. In front of this margin the surface gives attachment to the Quadratus f em oris, and anterior to this to some of the fibres of origin of the Obturator externus. The lower part of the surface gives origin to part of the Adductor magnus. The internal surface forms part of the bony wall of the true pelvis. In front, it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen. Behind, it is bounded by a sharp ridge, for the attachment of a falciform prolongation of the great sacro-sciatic ligament; it presents a groove on the inner side of this for the lodgment of the internal pudic vessels and nerve ; and, more anteriorly, has attached the Transversus perinasi and Erector penis muscles. The inferior surface is divided into two portions: an anterior, rough, somewhat triangular part and a posterior, smooth, quadrilateral portion. The anterior surface is subdivided by a prominent vertical ridge, passing from base to apex, into two parts ; the outer one gives attachment to the Adductor magnus, the inner to the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The posterior portion is subdivided into two facets by an oblique ridge, which runs forwards and outwards; from the upper and outer facet arises the Semi-membranosus ; from the lower and inner, the Biceps and Semi-tendinosus. The ramus, or ascending ramus, is the thin, flattened part of the ischium, which ascends from the tuberosity upwards and inwards, and joins the ramus of the os pubis —their point of junction being indicated in the adult by a rough line. The outer surface of the ramus is rough, for the attachment of the Obturator externus muscle, and also some fibres of the Adductor magnus ; its inner surface forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. Its inner border is thick, rough, slightly everted, forms part of the outlet of the pelvis, and presents two ridges and an intervening space. The ridges are continuous with similar ones on the descending ramus of the os pubis : to the outer one is attached the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia, and to the inner the anterior layer of the triangular ligament of the perin^eum. If these two ridges are traced downwards, they will be found to join with each other just behind the point of origin of the Transversus perin^i muscle ; here the two layers of fascia are continuous behind the posterior border of the muscle. To the inter- vening space, just in front of the point of junction of the ridges, is attached the Transversus perinsei muscle, and in front of this a portion of the crus penis vel clitoridis and the Erector penis vel clitoridis muscle. Its outer border is thin and sharp, and forms part of the inner margin of the obturator foramen. The Os Pubis forms the anterior part of the os innominatum, and, with the bone of the opposite side, forms the front boundary of the true pelvic ca^'ity. It is divisible into a body, a horizontal ramus, and a descending ramus. The body is somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and presents for examination twoTHE SKELETON 250 surfaces and three borders. The anterior surface is rough, directed forwards and outwards, and serves for the attachment of various muscles. To the upper and inner angle, immediately below the crest, is attached the Adductor longus ; lower down, from without inwards, are attached the Obturator externus, the Adductor brevis, and the upper part of the Gracilis. The posterior surface, convex from above downwards, concave from side to side, is smooth, and forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. It gives attachment to the Levator ani. Obturator internus, a few muscular fibres prolonged from the bladder, and the pubo-prostatic ligaments. The uioper border presents for examination a prominent tubercle, which projects forwards and is called the spine ; to it is attached the outer pillar of the external abdominal ring and Poupart's ligament. Passing outwards from this is a promi- nent ridge, forming part of the ilio-jjectineal line which, running outwards, marks the brim of the true pelvis : to it is attached a portion of the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles, Gimbernat's ligament and the triangular ligament of the abdomen. Internal to the spine of the os pubis is the crest, which extends from this process to the inner extremity of the bone. It affords attachment, anteriorly, to the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis; and posteriorly, to the Eectus and Pyramidalis muscles. The point of junction of the crest with the inner border of the bone is called the angle ; to it, as well as to the symphysis, is attached the internal pillar of the external abdominal ring. The internal border is the symphysis ; it is oval, covered by eight or nine transverse ridges, or a series of nipple-like processes arranged in rows, separated by grooves ; they serve for the attachment of a thin layer of cartilage, placed between it and the central fibro-cartilage. The outer border presents a sharp margin, which forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen and affords attachment to the obturator membrane. The horizontal ramus extends from the body to the point of junction of the os pubis with the ilium, and forms the upper part of the circumference of the obturator foramen. It presents for examination a superior, inferior, and posterior surface, and an outer extremity. The superior surface presents a continuation of the ilio-pectineal line, already mentioned as commencing on the body of the bone. In front of this ridge, the surface of bone is triangular in form, wider externally than internally, smooth, and affords attachment to the Pectineus muscle. The surface is bounded externally by a rough eminence, the ilio-pectineal, which serves to indicate the point of junction of the ilium and pubes, and gives attachment to the Psoas parvus, when this muscle is present. The inferior surface forms the upper boundary of the obturator foramen, and presents, externally, a broad and deep, oblique groove, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve ; and internally, a sharp margin which forms part of the circumference of the obturator foramen, and to which the obturator membrane is attached. The posterior surface forms part of the anterior boundary of the true pelvis. It is smooth, convex from above downwards, and affords attachment to the upper fibres of the obturator internus. The outer extremity, the thickest part of the ramus, forms one-fifth of the cavity of the acetabulum. The descending ramus of the os pubis is thin and flattened. It passes outw^ards and downwards, becoming narrower as it descends and joins with the ramus of the ischium. Its anterior surface is rough, for the attachment of muscles—the Gracilis along its inner border ; a portion of the Obturator externus where it enters into the formation of the foramen of that name; and between these two muscles, the Adductores brevis and magnus from within outwards. The posterior surface is smooth, and gives attachment to the Obturator internus, and close to the inner margin to the Compressor urethr^e. The inner border is thick, rough, and everted, especially in females. It presents two ridges, separated by an intervening space. The ridges extend downwards, and are continuous with similar ridges on the ascending ramus of the ischium ; to the external one is attached the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia, and to the internal one the anterior layer of the triangular ligament of the perineum. The outer border is thin and sharp, formsOS INNOMINATUM part of the circumference of the obturator foramen, and gives attachment to the obturator membrane. The cotyloid cavity, or acetabulum, is a deep, cup-shaped, hemispherical depression, directed downwards, outwards, and forwards ; formed internally by the OS pubis, above by the ilium, behind and below by the ischium ; a little less than two-fifths being formed by the ilium, a little more than two-fifths by the ischium, and the remaining fifth by the pubic bone. It is bounded by a prominent, uneven rim, which is thick and strong above, and serves for the attachment of a fibro- cartilaginous structure which contracts its orifice, and deepens the surface for articulation. It presents, on its inner side, a deep notch, the cotyloid notch, which is continuous with a circular depression, the fossa acetahuli, at the bottom of the cavity : this depression is perforated by numerous apertures, lodges a mass of fat, and its margins, as well as those of the notch, serve for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. The notch is converted, in the natural state, into a foramen by a dpnse ligamentous band which passes across it. Through this foramen the nutrient vessels and nerves enter the joint. The obturator or thyroid foramen is a large aperture, situated between the ischium and os pubis. In the male it is large, of an oval form, its longest diameter being obliquely from above downwards ; in the female it is smaller, and more triangular. It is bounded by a thin, uneven margin, to which a strong membrane is attached ; and presents, at its upper and outer part, a deep groove, which runs from the pelvis obliquely forwards, inwards, and downwards. This groove is con- verted into a foramen by the obturator membrane, and transmits the obturator vessels and nerve. Structure.—This bone consists of much cancellous tissue, especially where it is thick, enclosed between two layers of dense, compact tissue. In the thinner parts of the bone, as at the bottom of the acetabulum and centre of the iliac fossa, it is usually semi-transparent, and composed entirely of compact tissue. Development (fig. 209).—By eight centres: three primary—one for the ilium, one for the ischium, and one for the os pubis ; and five secondary—one for the crest of the ilium, one for the anterior inferior spinous process (said to occur more frequently in the male than the female), one for the tuberosity of the ischium, one for the symphysis pubis (more frequent in the female than the male), and one for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum. These various centres appear in the following order: First, in the ilium, at the lower part of the bone, imme- diately above the sciatic notch, at about the eighth or ninth week ; secondly, in the body of the ischium, at about the third month of foetal life; thirdly, in the body of the OS pubis, between the fourth and fifth months. At birth, the three primary centres are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum, and the rami of the ischium and pubes being still cartilaginous. At about the seventh or eighth year, the rami of the os pubis and ischium are almost completely ossified. About the thirteenth or fourteenth year, the three divisions of the bone have extended their growth into the bottom of the acetabulum, being separated from each other by a Y-shaped portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two or more centres. The ilium and ischium then become joined, and lastly the OS pubis, through the intervention of this Y-shaped portion. At about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of the remaining portions, and they become joined to the rest of the bone about the twenty-fifth year.

The Pelvis (figs. 210, 211) The Pelvis, so called from its resemblance to a basin (L. pelvis), is stronger and more massively constructed than either the cranial or thoracic cavity ; it is a bony ring, interposed between the lower end of the spine, which it supports, and the lower extremities, upon which it rests. It is composed of four bones : the two ossa innominata, which bound it on either side and in front; and the sacrum and coccyx, which complete it behind. The pelvis is divided by a plane passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the linea ilio-pectinea, and the upper margin of the symphysis pubis, into the false and true pelvis. The false pelvis is all that expanded portion of the pelvic cavity which is situated above this plane. It is bounded on each side by the ossa ilii ; in front it is incomplete, presenting a wide interval between the spinous processes of the ilia on either side, which is filled up in the recent state by the parietes of the abdomen ;PELVIS ^ behind, in the middle line, is a deep notch. This broad, shallow cavity is fitted to support the intestines, and to transmit part of their weight to the anterior wall of the abdomen, and is, in fact, really a portion of the abdominal cavity. The term false pelvis is incorrect, and this space ought more properly to be regarded as part of the hypogastric region of the abdomen. The true pelvis is all that part of the pelvic cavity which is situated beneath Fig. 2IO.—Male pelvis (adult). Fig. 211.—^Female pelvis (adult). the plane. It is smaller than the false pelvis, but its walls are more perfect. For convenience of description, it is divided into a superior circumference or inlet, an inferior circumference or outlet, and a cavity. The superior circumference forms the margin or brim of the pelvis, the included space being called the mlet. It is formed by the linea ilio-pectinea, completed in front by the crests of the pubic bones, and behind by the anterior margin of the baseTHE SKELETON 254 of the sacrum and sacro-vertebral angle. The inlet of the pelvis is somewhat heart- shaped, obtusely pointed in front, diverging on either side, and encroached upon behind by the projection forwards of the promontory of the sacrum. It has three principal diameters : antero-posterior (sacro-pubic), transverse, and oblique. The antero-posterior extends from the sacro-vertebral angle to the symphysis pubis; its average measurement is four inches in the male, four and three-quarters in the female. The transverse extends across the greatest width of the inlet, from the middle of the brim on one side to the same point on the opposite ; its average measurement is four and a half in the male, five and a quarter in the female. The oblique extends from the margin of the pelvis, corresponding to the ilio-pectineal eminence on one side, to the sacro-iliac symphysis on the opposite side; its average measurement is four and a quarter in the male, and five in the female. The cavity of the true pelvis is bounded in front by the symphysis pubis ; behind, by the concavity of the sacrum and coccyx, which, curving forwards above and below, contracts the inlet and outlet of the canal; and laterally it is bounded by a broad, smooth, quadrangular surface of bone, corresponding to the inner surface of the body of the ischium and that part of the ilium which is below the ilio-pectineal line. The cavity is shallow in front, measuring at the symphysis an inch and a half in depth, three inches and a half in the middle, and four inches and a half posteriorly. From this description, it will be seen that the cavity of the pelvis is a short, curved canal, considerably deeper on its posterior than on its anterior wall, and broader in the middle than at either extremity, from the projection forwards of the sacro-coccygeal colamn above and below. This cavity contains, in the recent subject, the rectum, bladder, and part of the organs of generation. The rectum is placed at the back of the pelvis, and corresponds to the curve of the sacro-coccygeal column ; the bladder in front, behind the symphysis pubis. In the female, the uterus and vagina occupy the interval between these parts. The lower circumference of the pelvis is very irregular, and forms what is called the outlet. It is bounded by three prominent eminences : one posterior, formed by the point of the coccyx ; and one on each side, the tuberosities of the ischia. These eminences are separated by three notches : one in front, iheimhic arch, formed by the convergence of the rami of the ischia and pubic bones on each side. The other notches, one on each side, are formed by the sacrum and coccyx behind, the ischium in front, and the ilium above : they are called the sacro-sciatic notches ; in the natural state they are converted into foramina by the lesser and greater sacro-sciatic ligaments. In the recent state, when the ligaments are in situ, the outlet of the pelvis is lozenge-shaped, bounded, in front, by the subpubic ligament and the rami of the os pubis and ischium ; on each side, by the tuberosities of the ischia ; and behind, by the great sacro-sciatic ligaments and the tip of the coccyx. The diameters of the outlet of the pelvis are two, antero-posterior and trans- verse. The antero-posterior extends from the tip of the coccyx to the lower part of the symphysis pubis; its average measurement is three and a quarter inches in the male and five in the female. The antero-posterior diameter varies with the length of the coccyx, and is capable of increase or diminution, on account of the mobility of that bone.* The transverse extends from the posterior part of one ischiatic tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side : the average measure- ment is three and a half inches in the male and four and three-quarters in the female. Position of the Pelvis.—In the erect posture, the pelvis is placed obliquely * The measurements of the pelvis given above are, I believe, fairly accurate, but different measurements are given by various authors, no doubt due in a great measure to differences m the physique and stature of the population from whom the measurements have been taken. The accompanying chart has been formulated to show the measure- ments of the pelvis, which are adopted by many obstetricians.—Ed. A.P. Obi. Tr. Inlet . 4 4| 5 Cavity 4^ 4^ 4|- Outlet 5 4|- 4255 PELVIS with regard to the trunk of the body : the bony ring, which separates the true from the false pelvis, and which forms the essential part of the pelvis, is placed so as to form an angle of about 60° to 65° with the ground on which we stand. The pelvic surface of the symphysis pubis looks upwards and backwards, the concavity of the sacrum and coccyx downwards and forwards ; the base of the sacrum in well-formed female bodies being nearly four inches above the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx a little more than half an inch above its lower border. The obliquity is much greater in the foetus, and at an early period of life, than in the adult. In consequence of this obliquity of the pelvis, the line of gravity of the head, which passes through the middle of the odontoid process of the axis and through the points of junction of the curves of the vertebral column to the sacro-vertebral angle, descends towards the front of the cavity, so that it bisects a line drawn transversely through the middle of the heads of the thigh-bones. And thus the centre of gravity of the head is placed immediately over the heads of the thigh-bones on which the trunk is supported. Axes of the Pelvis (fig. 212).—The plane of the inlet of the true pelvis will be represented by a line drawn from the base of the sacrum to the upper margin of the symphysis pubis. A line carried at right angles with this at its middle, would correspond at one extremity with the umbilicus, and at the other with the middle of the coccyx : the axis of the inlet is therefore directed downwards and backwards. The axis of the outlet, produced upwards, would touch the base of the sacrum, and is therefore directed downwards and forwards. The axis of the cavity is curved like the cavity itself : this curve corresponds to the concavity of the sacrum and coccyx, the extremities being indicated by the central points of the inlet and outlet. A knowledge of the direction of these axes serves to explain the course of the foetus in its passage through the pelvis during par- turition. It is also important to the surgeon, as indicating the direction of the force required in the removal of calculi from the bladder, and as determining the direction in which instruments should be used in oper- ations upon the pelvic viscera. Differences between the Male and Female Pelvis.—The female pelvis, looked at as a whole, is distinguished from the male by the bones being more delicate, by its width being greater and its depth smaller. The whole pelvis is less massive, and its bones are lighter and more slender, and its muscular impressions are slightly marked. The iliac fossae are broad and expanded, and the anterior iliac spines widely separated ; hence the greater prominence of the hips. The inlet in the female is larger than in the male ; it is more nearly circular, and the sacro-vertebral angle projects less forwards. The cavity is shallower and wider; the sacrum is shorter and wider, and its lower half forms a greater angle with its upper ; the obturator foramina are triangular, and smaller in size than in the male. The outlet is larger and the coccyx more movable. The spines of the ischia project less inwards. The tuberosities of the ischia and the acetabula are wider apart. The imhic arch is wider and more rounded than in the male, where it is an angle rather than an arch; its pillars are somewhat excavated, and sloped from within outwards, so that their inner surfaces look forwards. In consequence of this the width of the fore part of the pelvic outlet is much increased and the passage of the foetal head facilitated. The size of the pelvis varies, not only in the two sexes, but also in different Fig. 212.—Vertical section of the pelvis, with Imes mdicatmg the axes of the pelvis.THE SKELETON * Wood. Heath's Dictionary of Practical Surgery, i. 426. members of the same sex. This does not appear to be influenced in any way by the height of the individual. Women of short stature, as a rule, have broad pelves. Occasionally the pelvis is equally contracted in all its dimensions, so much so that all its diameters measure an inch less than the average, and this even in women of average height and otherwise well formed. The principal divergences, however, are found at the inlet, and affect the relation of the antero-posterior to the transverse diameter. Thus we may have a pelvis the inlet of which is elliptical either in a transverse or antero-posterior direction ; the transverse diameter in the former, and the antero-posterior in the latter, greatly exceeding the other diameters. Again, the inlet of the pelvis in some instances is seen to be almost circular. The same differences are found in various races. European women are said to have the most roomy pelves. That of the negress is smaller, circular in shape, and with a narrow pubic arch. The Hottentots and Bushwomen possess the smallest pelves. In the fcehcs, and for several years after birth, the pelvis is small in proportion to that of the adult. The cavity is deep, and the projection of the sacro-vertebral angle less marked. The antero-posterior and transverse diameters are nearly equal. About puberty, the pelvis in both sexes presents the general characters of the adult male pelvis ; but after puberty it acquires its proper sexual characters. Surface Form.—The pelvic bones are so thickly covered with muscles that it is only at certain points that they approach the surface and can be felt through the skin. In front, the anterior superior spinous process is easily to be recognised; a portion of it is sub- cutaneous, and in thin subjects may be seen to stand out as a prominence at the outer extremity of the fold of the groin. In fat subjects its position is marked by an oblique depression amongst the surrounding fat, at the bottom of which the bony process may be felt. Proceeding upwards and outwards from this process, the crest of the ilium may be traced throughout its whole length, sinuously curved. It is represented, in muscular subjects, on the surface, by a groove or furrow, the iliac furrow, caused by the projection of fleshy fibres of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen. It terminates behind in the posterior superior spinous process, the position of which is indicated by a slight depression on a level with and on each side of the spinous process of the second sacral vertebra^ Between the two posterior superior spinous processes, but at a lower level, is to be felt the spinous process of the third sacral vertebra (see page 132). Another part of the bony pelvis which is easily accessible to the touch is the tuberosity of the ischium, situated beneath the gluteal fold, and, when the hip is flexed, easily to be felt, as it is then to a great extent uncovered by muscle. Finally, the spine of the os pubis can always be readily felt, and constitutes an important surgical guide, especially in connection Mdth the subject of hernia. It is nearly in the same horizontal line with the upper edge of the great trochanter. In thin subjects'it is very apparent, but in the obese it is obscured by the pubic fat. It can, however, be detected by following up the tendon of origin of the Adductor longus muscle. Surgical Anatomy.—There is arrest of development in the bones of the pelvis in cases of extroversion of the bladder; the anterior part of the pelvic girdle being deficient, the bodies of tiie pubic bones imperfectly developed, and the symphysis absent. ' The pubic bones are separated to the extent of from two to four inches, the superior rami'shortened and directed forwards, and the obturator foramen diminished in size, narrowed, and turned outwards. The iliac bones are straightened out more than normal. The sacrum is very peculiar. The lateral curve, instead of being concave, is flattened out or even convex, with the ilio-sacral facets turned more outward than normal, while the vertical curve is straightened.' * Fractures of the pelvis are divided into fractures of the false pelvis and of the true pelvis. Fractures of the false pelvis vary in extent; a small portion of the crest may be broken, or one of the spinous processes may be torn off, and this may be the result of muscular action ; or the bone may be extensively comminuted. This latter accident is the result of some crushing violence, and may be complicated with fracture of the true pelvis. These cases may be accom- panied by injury to the intestine as it lies in the hollow of the bone, or to the iliac vessels as they course along the margin of the true pelvis. Fractures of the true pelvis generally occur through the horizontal ramus of the os pubis and the ascending ramus of the ischium, as this is the weakest part of the bony ring, and may be caused either by crushing violence applied in an antero-posterior direction, when the fracture occurs from direct force, or by compression laterally, when the acetabula are pressed together and the bone gives way in the same place from indirect violence. Occasionally the fracture may be double, occurring on both sides of the body. It is in these cases that injury to the contained viscera is liable to takeFEMUR 257 place, the urethra, the bladder, the rectum, the vagina in the female, the small intestines, and even the uterus, have all been lacerated by a displaced fragment. Fractures of the acetabulum are occasionally met with : either a portion of the rim may be broken off, or a fracture may take place through the bottom of the cavity and the head of the femur driven inwards and project into the pelvic cavity. Separation of the Y-shaped cartilage at the bottom of the acetabulum may also occur in the young subject, separating the bone into its three anatomical portions. The sacrum is occasionally, but rarely, broken by direct violence,—i.e. blows, kicks or falls on the part. The lesion may be complicated with injury to the nerves of the sacral plexus, leading to paralysis and loss of sensation in the lower extremity, or to incontinence of faeces from paralysis of the sphincter ani. The pelvic bones often undergo important deformity in rickets, the effect of which in the adult woman may interfere seriously with child-bearing. In consequence of the yielding nature of the bones, the acetabula become approximated, the symphysis is pushed forward, and the antero-posterior diameter lessened. In osteo-malacia also great deformity may occur, the pelvis becoming beak-shaped. The promontory of the sacrum is pushed forward by the weight of the body, and the sides of the pelvis are approximated by the pressure of the two thigh-bones: this gives to the pelvis the peculiar deformity which is characteristic of this disease. The Femur or Thigh-bone The Femur (femur, the thigh) is the longest,* largest, and strongest bone in the skeleton, and almost perfectly cylindrical in the greater part of its extent. In the erect posture it is not vertical, being separated from its fellow above by a considerable interval, which corresponds to the entire breadth of the pelvis, but inclining gradually downwards and inwards, so as to approach its fellow towards its lower part, for the purpose of bringing the knee-joint near the line of gravity of the body. The degree of this inclination varies in different persons, and is greater in the female than the male, on account of the greater breadth of the pelvis. The femur, like other long bones, is divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity presents for examination a head, a neck, and the great and lesser trochanters. The head, which is globular, and forms rather more than a hemisphere, is directed upwards, inwards, and a little forwards, the greater part of its convexity being above and in front. Its surface is smooth, coated with cartilage in the recent state, except at a little behind and below its centre, where there is an ovoid depression, for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. The neck is a flattened pyramidal process of bone, which connects the head with the shaft. It varies in length and obliquity at various periods of life, and under different circumstances. The angle is widest in infancy, and becomes lessened during growth, so that at puberty it forms a gentle curve from the axis of the shaft. In the adult it forms an angle of about 130° with the shaft, but varies in inverse proportion to the development of the pelvis and the stature. In consequence of the prominence of the hips and widening of the pelvis in the female, the neck of the thigh-bone forms more nearly a right angle with the shaft than it does in man. It has been stated that the angle diminishes in old age and the direction of the neck becomes horizontal, but this statement is founded on insufficient evidence. Sir George Humphry states that the angle decreases during the period of growth, but after full growth has been attained it does not usually undergo any change, even in old age. He further states that the angle varies considerably in different persons of the same age. It is smaller in short than in long bones, and when the pelvis is wide.f The neck is flattened from before backwards, contracted in the middle, and broader at its outer extremity, where it is connected with the shaft, than at its summit, where it is attached to the head. The vertical diameter of the outer half is increased by the thickening of the lower edge, which slopes downwards to join the shaft at the lesser trochanter, so that the outer half of the neck is flattened from before backwards, and its vertical diameter measures one third more than the antero-posterior. The inner half is smaller, and of a more circular shape. The anterior surface of the neck is perforated by numerous vascular foramina. * In a man six feet high, it measures eighteen inches—one-fourth of the whole body, t Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. sTHE SKELETON Fig. 213 Oliturator hiteriuis and gemelli Pijriformis Eiffht femur. Anterior surface Depre^aion for .ligamentum tere. yArtie. ri;'f/,l The posterior surface is smooth, and is broader and more concave than the an- terior ; it gives attachment to the posterior part of the \^ III capsular ligament of the hip-joint, about half an inch above the posterior intertrochanteric line. The suj)erior border is short and thick, and -/ terminates externally at the great tro- chanter ; its surface is perforated by large foramina. The inferior border, long and narrow, curves a little backwards, to terminate at the lesser trochanter. The Trochanters {rpoxaoi, to run or roll) are prominent processes of bone which afford leverage to the muscles which rotate the thigh on its axis. They are two in number, the great and the lesser. The Great Trochanter is a large, irregular, quadrilateral eminence, situ- ated at the outer side of the neck, at its junction with the upper part of the shaft. It is directed a little outwards and back- wards, and, in the adult, is about three- quarters of an inch lower than the head. It presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The external surface, quadrilateral in form, is broad, rough, convex, and marked by a prominent dia- gonal line, which extends from the pos- terior superior to the anterior inferior angle ; this line serves for the attach- ment of the tendon of the Gluteus medius. Above the line is a triangular surface, sometimes rough for part of the tendon of the same muscle, sometimes smooth for the interposition of a bursa between that tendon and the bone. Below and behind the diagonal line is a smooth, triangular surface, over which the tendon of the Gluteus maximus muscle plays, a bursa being interposed. The internal surface is of much less extent than the external, and presents at its base a deep depression, the digital or trochanteric fossa, for the attachment of the tendon of the Obturator externus muscle, and in front of this an impression for the attach- ment of the Obturator internus and Gemelli. The suj^erior border is free ; it is thick and irregular, and marked near the centre by an impression for the at- tachment of the Pyriformis. The inferior 6o7Y/er corresponds to the point of junc- WyZ. tion of the base of the trochanter with the SUS'CeUREUS259 FEMUR outer surface of the shaft; it is marked by a rough, prominent, shghtly curved ridge, which gives attachment to the upper part of the Vastus externus muscle. The anterior border is prominent, somewhat irregular, as well as the surface of bone immediately below it; it affords attachment at its outer part to the Gluteus minimus. The ijosterior border is very prominent, and appears as a free, rounded edge, which forms the back part of the digital fossa. The Lesser Trochanter is a conical eminence, which varies in size in different subjects; it projects from the lower and back part of the base of the neck. Its base is triangular, and connected with the adjacent parts of the bone by three well-marked borders: two of these are above—the internal continuous with the lower border of the neck, the externcd with the posterior intertrochanteric line— while the inferior border is continuous with the middle division of the linea aspera. Its summit, which is directed inwards and backwards, is rough, and gives insertion to the tendon of the Psoas magnus. The Iliacus is inserted into the shaft below the lesser trochanter, between the Vastus internus in front and the Pectineus behind. A well-marked prominence, of variable size, which projects from the upper and front part of the neck, at its junction with the great trochanter, is called the tubercle of the femur; it is the point of meeting of five muscles : the Gluteus minimus externally, the Vastus externus below, and the tendon of the Obturator internus and Gemelli above. Running obliquely downwards and inwards from the tubercle is the S2J^m^ line of the femur, or anterior intertrochanteric line', it winds round the inner side of the shaft, below the lesser trochanter, and termi- nates in the linea aspera, about two inches below this eminence. Its upper half is rough, and affords attachment to the capsular ligament of the hip-joint; its lower half is less prominent, and gives attachment to the upper part of the Vastus internus. Running obliquely downwards and inwards from the summit of the great trochanter on the posterior surface of the neck is a very prominent, well- marked ridge, the posterior intertrochanteric line. Its upper half forms the posterior border of the great trochanter, and its lower half runs downwards and inwards across the neck of the bone to the upper and back part of the lesser trochanter. A slight ridge sometimes commences about the middle of the posterior intertrochanteric line, and passes vertically downwards for about two inches along the back part of the shaft : it is called the linea quadrata, and gives attachment to the Quadratus femoris and a few fibres of the Adductor magnus muscles.* The Shaft, almost cylindrical in form, is a little broader above than in the centre, and somewhat flattened below, from before backwards. It is slightly arched, so as to be convex in front and concave behind, where it is strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the linect aspera. It presents for examination three borders, separating three surfaces. Of the three borders, one, the linea aspera, is posterior; the other two are placed laterally. The linea aspera (fig. 214) is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle third of the bone, presenting an external lip, an internal lip, and a rough intermediate space. Above, this crest is prolonged by three ridges. The most external one is very rough, and is continued almost vertically upwards to the base of the great trochanter. It is sometimes termed the gluteal ridge, and gives attach- ment to part of the Gluteus maximus muscle; its upper part is often elongated into a roughened crest, on which is a more or less well-marked, rounded tubercle, a rudimental third trochanter. The middle ridge, the least distinct, is continued to the base of the trochanter minor ; and the internal one is lost above in the spiral line of the femur. Below, the linea aspera is prolonged by two ridges, which enclose between them a triangular space, the popliteal space, upon which rests the popliteal artery. Of these two ridges, the outer one is the more prominent, and descends to the summit of the outer condyle. The inner one is less marked, * Generally there is merely a slight thickening about the centre of the intertrochanteric line, marking the point of attachment of the Quadratus femoris. This is termed by some anatomists the tiLbercle of the Quadratus. S 226o THE SKELETON -Eight femiir. surface. rURATOR EXTERNUS WW Posterior especially at its upper part, where it is crossed by the femoral artery. It termi- nates, below, at the summit of the internal condyle, in a small tubercle, the Adductor tubeixle, which affords attachment to the tendon of the Adductor magnus. To the inner lip of the linea aspera and its inner prolongation above and below is attached the Vastus internus : and to the outer lip and its outer pro- longation above is attached the Vastus externus. The Adductor magnus is at- tached to the linea aspera, to its outer prolongation above, and its inner pro- longation below. Between the Vastus externus and the Adductor magnus are attached two muscles—viz. the Gluteus maximus above, and the short head of the Biceps beloAv. Between the Adductor magnus and the Vastus internus four muscles are attached: the Iliacus and Pectineus above (the latter to the middle of the upper divisions); below these, the Adductor brevis and Adductor longus. The linea aspera is perforated a little below its centre by the nutrient canal, which is directed obliquely upwards. The two lateral borders of the femur are only slightly marked, the outer one extending from the anterior inferior angle of the great trochanter to the anterior extremity of the external condyle ; the inner one from the spiral line, at a point opposite the trochanter minor, to the an- terior extremity of the internal condyle. The internal border marks the limit of attachment of the Crureus muscle inter- nally. The anterior surface includes that portion of the shaft which is situated between the two lateral borders. It is smooth, convex, broader above and below than in the centre, slightly twisted, so that its upper part is directed forwards and a little outwards, its lower part for- wards and a little inwards. To the upper three-fourths of this surface the Crureus is attached; the lower fourth is sepa- rated from the muscle by the intervention of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint and a bursa, and affords attachment to the Sub- ■ Groove for tendon crureus to a Small extent. The 0/ Popiiteus external surface includes the portion of bone between the external border and the outer lip of the linea aspera; it is261 FEMUR continuous above with the outer surface of the great trochanter, below with the outer surface of the external condyle: to its upper three-fourths is attached the outer portion of the Crureus muscle. The internal surface includes the portion of bone between the internal border and the inner lip of the linea aspera ; it is continuous above with the lower border of the neck, below with the inner side of the internal condyle : it is covered by the Vastus internus muscle. The Lower Extremity, larger than the upper, is of a cuboid form, flattened from /before backwards, and divided into two large eminences, the condyles (kwSvAos, a knuckle), by an interval which presents a smooth depression in front called the trochlea, and a notch of considerable size behind—the inter condyloid notch. The external condyle is the more prominent anteriorly, and is the broader both in the antero-posterior and transverse diameters. The internal condyle is the narrower, longer, and more prominent inferiorly. This difference in the length of the two condyles is only observed when the bone is perpendicular, and depends upon the obliquity of the thigh-bones, in consequence of their separation above at the articulation with the pelvis. If the femur is held obliquely, the surfaces of the two condyles will be seen to be nearly horizontal. The two condyles are directly continuous in front, and form a smooth trochlear surface, which articulates with the patella. It presents a median groove, which extends downwards and back- wards to the intercondyloid notch ; and two lateral convexities, of which the external is the broader, more prominent, and prolonged farther upwards upon the front of the outer condyle. The external border is also more prominent, and ascends higher than the internal one. The intercondyloid notch lodges the crucial liga- ments ; it is bounded laterally by the- opposed surfaces of the two condyles, and in front by the lower end of the shaft. Outer Condyle.—The outer surface of the external condyle presents, a little behind its centre, an eminence, the outer tuberosity ; it is less prominent than the inner tuberosity, and gives attachment to the external lateral ligaments of the knee. Immediately beneath it is a groove which commences at a depression a little behind the centre of the lower border of this surface : the front part of this depression gives origin to the Popliteus muscle, the tendon of which is lodged in the groove during flexion of the knee. The groove is smooth, covered with cartilage in the recent state, and runs upwards and backwards to the posterior extremity of the condyle. The inner surface of the outer condyle forms one of the lateral boundaries of the intercondyloid notch, and gives attachment, by its posterior part, to the anterior crucial ligament. The inferior surface is convex, smooth, and broader than that of the internal condyle. The posterior extremity is convex and smooth : just above the articular surface is a depression for the tendon of the outer head of the Gastrocnemius, above which is the origin of the Plantaris. Inner Condyle.—The inner siirface of the inner condyle presents a convex eminence, the inner tuberosity, rough, for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament. The outer side of the inner condyle forms one of the lateral boundaries of the intercondyloid notch, and gives attachment, by its anterior part, to the posterior crucial ligament. Its inferior or articular surface is convex, and presents a less extensive surface than the external condyle. Just above the articular surface of the condyle, behind, is a depression for the tendon of origin of the inner head of the Gastrocnemius. Structure.—The shaft of the femur is a cylinder of compact tissue, hollowed by a large medullary canal. The cylinder is of great thickness and density in the middle third of the shaft, where the bone is narrowest and the medullary canal well formed ; but above and below this the cylinder gradually ^becomes thinner, owing to a separation of the layers of the bone into cancelli, which project into the medullary canal and finally obliterate it, so that the upper and lower ends of the shaft, and the articular extremities more especially, consist of cancellated tissue, invested by a thin, compact layer. The arrangement of the cancelli in the ends of the femur is remarkable. In the upper end they are arranged in two sets. One, starting from the top of the head,262 THE SKELETON the upper surface of the neck, and the great trochanter, converge to the inner circumference of the shaft (fig. 215) ; these are placed in the direction of greatest pressure, and serve to support the vertical weight of the body. The second set are planes of lamellae intersecting the former nearly at right angles, and are situ- ated in the line of the greatest are arranged in a curved form, in order to strengthen the bone when exposed to pressure in all directions. In the midst of the cancellous tissue of the neck is a vertical plane of compact bone, the femoral spur {calcar femorale) which com- mences at the point where the neck joins the shaft midway between the lesser trochanter and the internal border of the shaft of the bone, and extends in the direction of the digital fossa (fig. 216). This materially strengthens this portion of the bone. Another point in connection with the structure of the neck of the femur requires mention, especially on account of its influence on the production of fracture in this situation. It will be noticed that a considerable portion of the great trochanter lies behind the level of the posterior surface of the neck ; and if a section be made through the trochanter at this level, it will be seen that the posterior wall of the neck is prolonged into the trochanter. This prolongation is termed by Bigelow the ' true neck,' * and forms a thin, dense plate of bone, which passes beneath the posterior intertrochanteric ridge towards the outer surface of the bone. In the lower end, the cancelli spring on all sides from the inner surface of the cylinder, and descend in a perpendicular direction to the articular surface, the cancelli being strongest and having a more accurately perpendicular course above the condyles. In addition to this, however, horizontal planes of cancellous tissue are to be seen, so that the spongy tissue in this situation presents an appearance of being mapped out into a series of rectangular areas. Articulations.—With three bones : the os innominatum, tibia, and patella. tension—that is to say, along the lines in which the muscles and ligaments exert their traction.

Of all the long bones, except the clavicle, it is the first to show traces of ossification ; this commences in the shaft, at about the fifth week of foetal life, the centres of ossification in the epiphyses appearing in the following order: First, in the lower end of the bone, at the ninth month of foetal life * (from this the condyles and tuberosities are formed); in the head at the end of the first year after birth; in the great trochanter, during the fourth year; and in the lesser trochanter, between the thir- teenth and fourteenth. The order in which the epiphyses are joined to the shaft is the reverse of that of their appearance : their junction does not commence until after puberty; the lesser tr,ochanter being first joined, then the great, then the head, and, lastly, the inferior extremity (the first in which ossifi- cation commenced), which is not united until the twentieth year. Attachment of Muscles.—To twenty-three. To the great tro- chanter : the Gluteus medius, Gluteus minimus, Pyriformis, Ob- turator internus, Obturator externus. Gemellus superior. Gemellus in- ferior, and Quadratus femoris. To the lesser trochanter : the Psoas magnus and the Iliacus below it. To the shaft: the Vastus externus, Gluteus maximus, short head of the Biceps, Vastus internus, Adductor magnus, Pectineus, Adductor brevis, Adductor longus, Crureus, and Subcrureus. To the condyles : the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, and Popliteus. Surface Form.—The femur is covered with muscles, so that in fairly muscular subjects the shaft is not to be detected through its Heshy covering, and the only parts accessible to the touch are the outer surface of the great trochanter and the lower expanded end of the bone. The external surface of the great trochanter is to be felt, especially in certain positions of the limb. Its position is generally indicated by a depression, owing to the thickness of the Gluteus medius and minimus, which project above it. When, however, the thigh is flexed, and especially if crossed over the opposite one, the trochanter produces a blunt eminence on the surface. The upper border is about on a line with the spine of the OS pubis, and its exact level is indicated by a line drawn from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, over the outer side of the hip, to the most prominent point of the tuberosity of the ischium. This is known as Nelaton's line. The outer and inner condyles of the lower extremity are easily to be felt. The outer one is more subcutaneous than the inner one, and readily felt. The tuberosity on it is comparatively little developed, but can be more or less easily recognised. The inner condyle is more thickly covered, and this gives a general convex outline to this part, especially when the knee is flexed. The tuberosity on it is easily felt, and at the upper part of the condyle the sharp tubercle for the insertion of the tendon of the Adductor magnus can be recognised without difficulty. When the knee is flexed, and the patella situated in the interval between the condyles and the upper end of the tibia, a part of the trochlear surface of the femur can be made out above the patella. Surgical Anatomy.—There are one or two points about the ossification of the femur bearing on practice to which allusion must be made. It has been stated above that the * This is the only epiphysis in which ossification begins before birth. Fig. 217.—Plan of the development of the femur. By five centres. Appears at ^ 4:th year ; >*vi f joins shaft ^ about 18th ijr. o Appears at 9th month {festal) '^^Appears at end * of 1st year ; joins shaft ahout 16th year Appears 13th-lith year; joins shaft ahout ISth year Joins shaft at 20th year264 THE SKELETON lower end of the femur is the only ei^iphysis in which ossification has commenced at the time of birth. The presence of this ossific centre is, therefore, a proof, in newly-born children found dead, that the child has arrived at the full period of utero-gestation, and is always relied upon in medico-legal investigations. The position of the epiphysial line should be carefLilly noted. It is on a level with the adductor tubercle, and the epiphysis does not, therefore, form the whole of the cartilage-clad portion of the lower end of the bone. It is essential to bear this point in mind in performing excision of the knee, since growth in length of the femm- takes place chiefly from the lower epiphysis, and any interference with the epiphysial cartilage in a young child would involve such ultimate shortening of the limb, from want of growth, as to render it almost useless. Separation of the lower epiphysis may take place up to the age of twenty, at which time it becomes completely joined to the shaft of the bone; but, as a matter of fact, few cases occur after the age of sixteen or seventeen. The upper epiphysis of the femur is of interest principally on account of its being the seat of origin of a large number of cases of tubercular disease of the hip-joint. The disease commences in the majority of cases in the highlj^ vascular and growing tissue in the neighbourhood of the epiphysis, and from here extends into the joint. Fractures of the femur are divided, like those of the other long bones, into fractures of the upper end ; of the shaft; and of the lower end. The fractures of the upper end may be classified into (i) fracture of the neck; (2) fracture at the junction of the neck with the great trochanter; (3) fracture of the great trochanter; and (4) separation of the epiphysis, either of the head or of the great trochanter. The first of these, fracture of the neck, is usually termed intracapsular fractm''e, but this is scarcely a correct designation as, owing to the attachment of the capsular ligament, the fractare maybe partly within and partly without the capsule when the fracture occurs at the lower part of the neck. It generally occurs in old people, principally women, and usually fi^om a very slight degree of indirect violence. Probably the main cause of the fracture taking place in old people, is in consequence of the degenerative changes which the bone has undergone. Merkel believes that is it mainly due to the absorption of the calcar femorale. These fractures are occasionally impacted. As a rule they unite by fibrous tissue, and frequently no union takes place, and the surfaces of the fracture become smooth and eburnated. Fractures at the junction of the neck with the great trochanter are usually termed extra-capsular, but this designation is also incorrect, as the fi^acture is partly within the capsule, owing to its attachment in front to the anterior intertrochanteric line, which is situated below the line of fracture. These fractures are produced by direct violence to the great trochanter, as from a blow or fall laterally on the hip. From the manner in which the accident is caused, the neck of the bone is driven into the trochanter, where it may remain impacted, or the trochanter may be split up into two or more fragments, and thus no fixation takes place. Fractures of the great trochanter may be either ' oblique fracture through the trochanter major, without implicating the neck of the bone ' (Astley Cooper), or separation of the great trochanter. Most of the recorded cases of this latter injury occurred in young persons, and were probably cases of separation of the epiphysis of the great trochanter. Separation of the epiphysis of the head of the femur has been said to occur, but, as far as I know, has never been verified by post-mortem examination. Fractm-es of the shaft may occur at any part, but the most usual situation is at or near the centre of the bone. They may be caused by direct or indirect violence or by muscular action. Fractures of the upper third of the shaft are almost always the result of indirect violence, whilst those of the lower third are the result, for the most part, of direct violence. In the middle third fractures occur from both forms of injury in about equal proportions. Fractures of the shaft are generally oblique, but they may be transverse, longitudinal, or spiral. The transverse fracture occurs most frequently in children. The fractures of the lower end of the femur include transverse fracture above the condyles, the most common; and this may be complicated by a vertical fracture between the condyles, constituting the T-shaped fracture. In these cases the x3opliteal artery is in danger of being wounded. Oblique fracture separating either the internal or external condyle, and a longitudinal incomplete fracture between the condyles may also take place. The femur as well as the other bones of the leg are frequently the seat of acute necrosis in young children. This is no doubt due to their greater exposure to injury, which is often the exciting cause of this disease. Tumours not uiifrequently are found growing from the femur : the most common forms being sarcoma, which may grow either from the periosteum or from the medullary tissue within the interior of the bone ; and exostosis, which is com- monly found originating in the neighbourhood of the epiphysial cartilage of the lower end. THE LEG The skeleton of the Leg consists of three bones : the Patella, a large, sesamoid bone, placed in front of the knee; the Tibia ; and the Fibula.265 PATELLA The Patella (figs. 218, 219) The Patella (patella, a small loan) is a flat, triangular bone, situated at the anterior part of the knee-joint. It is usually regarded as a sesamoid bone, developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor. It resembles these bones (i) in its being developed in a tendon ; (2) in its centre of ossification presenting a knotty or tuberculated out- line similar to other sesamoid bones; (3) in its structure being composed mainly of dense cancellous tissue, as in the other sesamoid bones. It serves to protect the front of the joint, and increases the leverage of the Quadriceps extensor by making it act at a greater angle. It presents an anterior and posterior surface, three borders, and an apex. The anterior surface is convex, perforated by small apertures, for the passage of nutrient vessels, and marked by numerous rough, longitudinal striae. This surface is covered, in the recent state, by an expansion from the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor, which is continuous below with the superficial fibres of the ligamentum patellae. It is separated from the integument by a bursa. The posterior surface presents a smooth, oval-shaped, articular surface, covered with cartilage in the recent state, and divided into two facets by a vertical ridge, which descends from the superior border towards the inferior angle of the bone. The ridge corresponds to the groove on the trochlear surface of the femur, and the two facets to the articular surfaces of the two condyles ; the outer facet, for articulation with the outer condyle, being the broader and deeper. This character serves to indicate the side to which the bone belongs. Below the articular surface is a rough, convex, non-articular depression, the lower half of which gives attachment to the ligamentum patellae ; the upper half being separated from the head of the tibia by adipose tissue. The superior border is thick, and sloped from behind, downwards and forwards ; it gives attachment to that portion of the Quadriceps extensor which is derived from the Eectus and Crureus muscles. The lateral borders are thinner, converging below. They give attachment to that portion of the Quadriceps extensor derived from the external and internal Vasti muscles. The apex is pointed, and gives attachment to the ligamentum patella. Structure.—It consists of a nearly uniform dense cancellous tissue, covered by a thin compact lamina. The cancelli immediately beneath the anterior surface are arranged parallel with it. In the rest of the bone they radiate from the posterior articular surface towards the other i^arts of the bone. Development.—By a single centre, which makes its appearance, according to Beclard, about the third year. In two instances, I have seen this bone cartilagi- nous throughout, at a much later period (six years). More rarely, the bone is developed by two centres, placed side by side. Ossification is completed about the age of puberty. Articulations.—With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles.—To four: the Eectus, Crureus, Vastus internus, and Vastus externus. These muscles, joined at their insertion, constitute the Quadriceps extensor cruris. Surface Form.—The external surface of the patella can be seen and felt in front of the knee. In the extended position of the limb the internal border is a little more prominent Fig. 218.—Eight patella. Fig. 219.—Posterior Anterior sm^face. surface.THE SKELETON 266 than the outer, and if the Quadriceps extensor is relaxed, the bone can be moved from side to side and appears to be loosely fixed. If the joint is flexed, the patella recedes into the hollow between the condyles of the femur and the upper end of the tibia, and becomes firmly fixed against the femur. Surgical Anatomy.—The main surgical interest about the patella is in connection with fractures, which are of common occurrence. They may be produced by muscular action, that is to say, by violent contraction of the Quadriceps extensor, while the limb is in a position of semi-flexion, so that the bone is snapped across the condyles; or by direct violence, such as falls on the knee. In the former class of cases the fractm-e is transverse ; in the latter it may be oblique, longitudinal, stellate, or the bone variously comminuted. The principal interest in these cases attaches to their treatment. Owing to the wide separation of the fragments, and the difficulty there is in maintaining them in apposition, union takes place by fibrous tissue, and this may subsequently stretch, producing wide separation of the fragments and permanent lameness. Various plans, including opening the joint and suturing the fragments, have been advocated for overcoming this difficulty. In the larger number of cases of fracture of the patella, the knee-joint is involved, the carti- lage which covers its posterior surface being also torn. In some cases of fracture from direct violence, however, this need not necessarily happen, the lesion involving only the superficial part of the bone ; and, as Morris has pointed out, it is an anatomical possibility, in complete fracture, if the lesion involve only the lower and non-articular part of the bone, for it to take place without injury to the synovial membrane. The Tibia (figs. 220, 221) The Tibia (tibia, a flute or pipe) is situated at the front and inner side of the leg, and, excepting the femur, is the longest and largest bone in the skeleton. It is prismoid in form, expanded above, where it enters into the knee-joint, more slightly enlarged below. In the male, its direction is vertical, and parallel with the bone of the opposite side ; but in the female it has a slightly oblique direction downwards and outwards, to compensate for the oblique direction of the femur inwards. It presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, or Head, is large, and expanded on each side into two lateral eminences, the tuberosities. Superiorly, the tuberosities present two smooth, concave surfaces, which articulate with the condyles of the femur ; the internal, articular surface is longer, deeper, and narrower than the external, oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle; the external one is broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular surfaces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is an eminence, the spinous process of the tibia, surmounted by a prominent tubercle on each side, which gives attachment to the extremities of the semilunar fibro-cartilages; in front and behind the spinous process is a rough depression for the attachment of the anterior and posterior crucial ligaments and the semilunar fibro-cartilages. The anterior surfaces of the tuberosities are continuous Avith one another, forming a single large surface, which is somewhat flattened : it is triangular, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina ; narrow below where it terminates in a prominent oblong elevation of large size, the tubercle of the tibia ; the lower half of this tubercle is rough, for the attachment of the ligamentum patellae ; the upper half presents a smooth facet supporting, in the recent state, a bursa which separates the ligament from the bone. Posteriorly the tuberosities are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the popliteal notch, which gives attachment to part of the posterior crucial ligament, and part of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The inner tuberosity presents posteriorly a deep transverse groove, for the insertion of one of the fasciculi of the tendon of the Semi-membranosus. Its lateral surface is convex, rough and prominent: it gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament. The outer tuber- osity presents posteriorly a flat articular facet, nearly circular in form, directed downwards, backwards, and outwards, for articulation wdth the fibula. Its lateral surface is convex and rough, more prominent in front than the internal: it presents a prominent rough eminence, situated on a level with the upper border of the tubercle of the tibia, for the attachment of the ilio-tibial band. Just below this the Extensor longus digitorum and a slip from the Biceps are attached.TIBIA 267 The Shaft of the tibia is of a triangular prisriioid form, broad above, gradually decreasing in size to its most slender part, at the commencement of its lower fourth, where fracture most fre- quently occurs ; it then enlarges again towards its lower extre- mity. It presents for examina- tion three borders and three sur- faces. The anterior border, the most prominent of the three, is called the crest of the tibia, or, in popular language, the shin ; it commences above at the tubercle, and terminates below at the anterior margin of the inner malleolus. This border is very prominent in the upper two- thirds of its extent, smooth and rounded below. It presents a very flexuous course, being usually curved outwards above, and in- wards below ; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg. The internal border is smooth and rounded above and be- low, but more prominent in the centre; it commences at the back part of the inner tuberosity, and terminates at the posterior border of the internal malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee to the extent of about two inches, and to some fibres of the Popliteus muscle; its middle third, to some fibres of the Soleus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The external border, or in- terosseous ridge, is thin and prominent, especially its central part,, and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the tibia and fibula. The internal surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than below ; its upper third, directed forwards and Fig. 220.—Bones of the right leg. Anterior surface. Head External malleolusTHE SKELETON 268 inwards, is covered by the aponeurosis derived from the tendon of the Sartorius, and by the tendons of the Gracilis and Semi-tendinosus, all of which are inserted nearly as far forwards as the Posterior Fig. 221, -Bones of the right leg. surface. Styloid process FIBULA Articulate ivitli--'astragalus. anterior border ; in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous. The external surface is narrower than the internal; its upper two-thirds presents a shal- low groove for the attachment of the Tibialis anticus muscle; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually forwards to the anterior part of the bone, and is covered from within outwards by the tendons of the follow- ing muscles : Tibialis anticus. Extensor proprius hallucis, Ex- tensor longus digitorum. The posterior surface (fig. 221) presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the oblique line of the tibia, which extends from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula obliquely downwards, to the internal border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds. It marks the limit for the in- sertion of the Popliteus muscle, and serves for the attachment of the popliteal fascia and part of the Soleus, Flexor longus digitorum, and Tibialis posticus muscles ; the triangular concave surface, above and to the inner side of this line, gives attachment to the Popliteus muscle. The middle third of the posterior surface is divided by a vertical ridge into two lateral halves : the ridge is well marked at its commencement at the oblique line, but becomes gradually indistinct below; the inner and broader half gives attachment to the Flexor longus digitorum, the outer and narrower to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of the bone presents a smooth surface covered by the Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longus hallucis muscles. Immediately below the oblique line is the medullary foramen, which is directed obliquely dowuAvards. The Lower Extremity, much269 .TIBIA Lower extremity smaller than the upper, presents five surfaces; it is prolonged downwards, on its inner side into a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface of the bone is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the astragalus. This surface is concave from before backwards, and broader in front than behind. It is traversed from before backwards by a slight elevation, separating two lateral depressions. It is narrow internally, where the articular surface becomes continuous with that on the inner malleolus. The anterior surface of the lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles of the toes; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression, for the attachment of the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint; the j^osterior sur- face presents a superficial groove directed obliquely downwards and inwards, continuous with a similar groove on the posterior extremity of the astragalus, and serving for the passage of the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis ; the external stcrface presents a triangular rough depression for the attachment of the inferior interosseous ligament connecting it with the fibula ; the lower part of this depression is smooth, covered with car- tilage in the recent state, and articu- lates with the fibula. This surface is bounded by two prominent ridges, continuous above with the interosseous ridge ; they afford attachment to the anterior and posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligaments. The internal surface of the lower extremity is prolonged downwards to form a strong pyramidal process, flattened from without inwards—the imier malleolus. The inner surface of this process is convex and subcutaneous; its outer surface is smooth and slightly concave, and articulates with the astragalus ; its anterior border is rough, for the attachment of the anterior fibres of the Deltoid ligament; its posterior border presents a broad and deep groove, directed obliquely downwards and inwards, which is occasionally double : this groove transmits the tendons of the Tibialis posticus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The summit of the internal malleolus is marked by a rough depression behind, for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. Structure.—Like that of the other long bones. At the junction of the middle and lower third, where the bone is smallest, the wall of the shaft is thicker than in other parts, in order to compensate for the smallness of the calibre of the bone. Development.—By three centres (fig. 222): one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the seventh week, and gradually extends towards either extremity. The centre for the upper epiphysis appears during the first year ; it is flattened in form, and has a thin, tongue-shaped process in front, which forms the tubercle. That for the lower epiphysis appears in the second year. The lower epiphysis joins the shaft at about the eighteenth, and the upper one about the twentieth year. Two additional centres occasionally exist, one for the tongue-shaped process of the upper epiphysis, which forms the tubercle, and one for the inner malleolus. Articulations.—With three bones : the femur, fibula, and astragalus. Attachment of Muscles.—To twelve: to the inner tuberosity, the Semi- FiG. 222.—Plan of the development of the tibia.

At the upper extremity the taberosities are to be recognised just below the knee. The internal one is broad and smooth, and merges into the subcutaneous surface of the shaft below. The external one is narrower and more prominent, and on it, about midway between the apex of the patella and the head of the fibula, may be felt a prominent tubercle for the insertion of the ilio-tibial band. In front of the upper end of the bone, between the tuberosities, is the tubercle of the tibia, forming an oval eminence, which is continuous below with the anterior border or crest of the bone. This border can be felt, forming the prominence of the shin, in the upper two-thirds of its extent being sharp and presenting a somewhat flexuous course, being curved outwards above and inwards below. In the lower third of the leg the border disappears and the bone is concealed by the tendons of the muscles on the front of the leg. Internal to the anterior border is to be felt the broad internal surface of the tibia, slightly encroached upon by the muscles in front and behind. It commences above at the wide expanded inner tuberosity and terminates below at the internal malleolus. The internal malleolus is a broad prominence situated on a higher level and somewhat further forwards than the external malleolus. It overhangs the inner border of the arch of the foot. Its anterior border is nearly straight, its posterior border presents a sharp edge, which forms the inner margin of the groove for the tendon of the Tibialis posticus muscle. The Fibula (figs. 220, 221) The Fibula (fibula, a clasp) is situated at the outer side of the leg. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones ; it is placed nearly parallel but behind the level of the tibia. Its upper extremity is small, placed towards the back of the head of the tibia, and below the level of the knee-joint, and excluded from its formation ; the lower extremity inclines a little forwards, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end, projects below the tibia, and forms the outer ankle. It presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, or Head, is of an irregular quadrate form, presenting above a flattened articular facet, directed upwards, forwards and inw^ards, for articulation with a corresponding facet on the external tuberosity of the tibia. On the^outer side is a thick and rough prominence, continued behind into a pointed eminence, the styloid process, which projects upwards from the posterior part of the head. The prominence gives attachment to the tendon of the Biceps muscle, and to the long external lateral ligament of the knee, the ligament dividing the tendon into two parts. The summit of the styloid process gives attachment to the short external lateral ligament. The remaining part of the circumference of the head is rough, for the attachment of the anterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, presenting, in front, a tubercle for the attachment of the upper and anterior part of the Peroneus longus; and behind, another tubercle for the attachment of the posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, and the upper fibres of the Soleus muscle. The shaft presents four borders—the antero-external, the antero-internal, the postero-external, and the postero-internal; and four surfaces—anterior, posterior, internal, and external. The antero-external border commences above in front of the head, runs verti- cally downwards to a little below the middle of the bone, and then curving some- what outwards, bifurcates so as to embrace the triangular subcutaneous surface immediately above the outer surface of the external malleolus. This border gives attachment to an intermuscular septum, which separates the extensor muscles on the anterior surface of the leg from the Peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The antero-internal border, or interosseous ridge, is situated close to the inner side of the preceding, and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges from it so as to include a broader space in the lower two-thirds. It commences above just beneath the head of the bone (sometimes it is quite271 FIBULA indistinct for about an inch below the head), and terminates below at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular facet of the external malleolus. It serves for the attachment of the interosseous membrane, and separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles behind. The postero-external border is prominent; it commences above at the base of the styloid process, and terminates below in the posterior border of the outer malleolus. It is directed outwards above, backw^ards in the middle of its course, backwards and a little inwards below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the Peronei muscles on the outer surface of the shaft from the flexor muscles on its posterior surface. The postero-internal border, sometimes called the oblique line, commences above at the inner side of the head, and terminates by becoming continuous with the antero-internal border or interosseous ridge at the lower fourth of the bone. It is well marked and prominent at the upper and middle parts of the bone. It gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the Tibialis posticus from the Soleus above and the Flexor longus hallucis below. The anterior surface is the interval between the antero-external and antero- internal borders. It is extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent; broader and grooved longitudinally in its lower third ; it serves for the attachment of three muscles, the Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius hallucis. The external surface is the space between the antero-external and postero- external borders. It is much broader than the preceding, and often deeply grooved, is directed outwards in the upper two-thirds of its course, backwards in the lower third, where it is continuous with the posterior border of the external malleolus. This surface is completely occupied by the Peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The internal surface is the interval included between the antero-internal and the postero-internal borders. It is directed inwards, and is grooved for the attach- ment of the Tibialis posticus muscle. * The posterior surface is the space included between the postero-external and the postero-internal borders ; it is continuous below with the rough triangular surface above the articular facet of the outer malleolus; it is directed backwards above, backwards and inwards at its middle, directly inwards below. Its upper third is rough, for the attachment of the Soleus muscle ; its lower part presents a triangular rough surface, connected to the tibia by a strong interosseous ligament, and between these two points the entire surface is covered by the fibres of origin of the Flexor longus hallucis muscle. At about the middle of this surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed downwards. The Lower Extremity, or external malleolus, is of a pyramidal form, somewhat flattened from without inwards, and is longer, and descends lower, than the internal malleolus. Its external surface is convex, subcutaneous, and continuous with the triangular (also subcutaneous) surface on the outer side of the shaft. The internal surface presents in front a smooth triangular facet, broader above than below, and convex from above downwards, which articulates with a corresponding surface on the outer side of the astragalus. Behind and beneath the articular surface is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle. The anterior border is thick and rough, and marked below by a depression for the attachment of the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. The posterior border is broad and marked by a shallow groove, for the passage of the tendons of the Peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The summit is rounded, and gives attachment to the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. In order to distinguish the side to which the bone belongs, hold it with the lower extremity downwards, and the broad groove for the Peronei tendons back- wards, i.e. towards the holder: the triangular subcutaneous surface will then be directed to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With two bones : the tibia and astragalus.272 THE SKELETON Fig. 223.—Plan of the develoiDinent of the fibula. By three centres. Upper extremity Appears ah out ^-i^^ Unites about Uhyear (Ss' 25^7i ?/ea>- Development.—By three centres (fig. 223): one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. Ossification commences in the shaft about the eighth week of foetal life, a little later than in the tibia, and extends gradually towards the extremities. At birth both ends are cartila- ginous. Ossification commences in the lower end in the second year, and in the upper one about the fourth year. The lower epiphysis, the first in which ossification commences, be- comes united to the shaft about the twentieth year; the upper epiphysis joins about the twenty-fifth year. Ossification appearing first in the lower epiphysis is contrary to the rule which prevails with regard to the commence- ment of ossification in epiphyses, viz. that that epiphysis towards which the nutrient artery is directed commences to ossify last; but it follows the rule which prevails with regard to the union of epiphyses, by uniting first. Attachment of Muscles.—To nine: to the head, the Biceps, Soleus, and Peroneus longus ; to the shaft, its anterior surface, the Exten- sor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius hallucis; to the internal surface, the Tibialis posticus ; to the posterior surface, the Soleus and Flexor longus hallucis ; to the external surface, the Peroneus longus and brevis. Appears at- 2nd year Unites about 20th year Loiver extremity Surface Form.—The only parts of the fibula which are to be felt are the head and the lower part of the external surface of the shaft and the external malleolus. The head is to be seen and felt behind and to the outer side of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. It presents a small, prominent, triangular eminence slightly above the level of the tubercle of the tibia. The external malleolus presents a narrow elongated prominence, situated on a plane posterior to the internal malleolus and reaching to a lower level. From it may be traced the lower third or half of the external surface of the shaft of the bone in the interval between the Peroneus tertius in front and the other two Peronei tendons behind. Surgical Anatomy.-—In fractures of the bones of the leg, both bones are usually fractured, but each bone may be broken separately, the fibula more frequently than the tibia. Fracture of both bones may be caused either by direct or indirect violence. When it occiu-s from indirect force, the fracture in the tibia is at the junction of the middle and lower third of the bone. Many causes conduce to render this the weakest part of the bone. The fracture of the fibula is usually at rather a higher level. These fractures present great variety, both as regards their direction and condition. They may be oblique, transverse, longitudinal, or spiral. "When oblique, they are usually the result of indirect violence, and the direction of the fracture is from behind, downwards, forwards, and inwards in many cases, but may be downwards and outwards, or downwards and backwards. When trans- verse, the fracture is often at the upper part of the bone, and is the result of direct violence. The spiral fracture usually commences as a vertical fissure, involving the ankle-joint, and is associated with fi-acture of the fibula higher up. It is the result of torsion, from twisting of the body whilst the foot is fixed. Fractures of the tibia alone are almost always the result of direct violence, except where the malleolus is broken off by twists of the foot. Fractures of the fibula alone may arise from indirect or direct force, those of the lower end being usually the result of the former, and those higher up being caiised by a direct blow on the part. The tibia and fibula, like the femur, are frequently the seat of acute necrosis. Chronic abscess^ is more fi-equently met with in the cancellous tissue of the head and lower end of the tibia than in any other bone of the body. The abscess is of small size, very chronic, and the result of rarefymg osteitis of a localised portion of the cancellous tissue. The tibia is the bone which is most frequently and most extensively distorted in rickets. It gives way at the jimction of the middle and lower third, its weakest part, and presents a curve forwards and outwards.CALCANEUM 273 THE FOOT (figs. 224, 225) The skeleton of the Foot consists of three divisions : the Tarsus, Metatarsus, and Phalanges. The Tarsus The bones of the Tarsus are seven in number: viz. the calcaneum or os calcis, astragalus, cuboid, navicular, internal, middle, and external cuneiform bones. The Calcaneum The Calcaneum, or Os Calcis (calx, the heel), is the largest and strongest of the tarsal bones. It is irregularly cuboidal in form, having its long axis directed forwards and outwards. It is situated at the lower and back part of the foot, serving to transmit the weight of the body to the ground, and forming a strong- lever for the muscles of the calf. It presents for examination six surfaces: superior, inferior, external, internal, anterior, and posterior. The superior surface is formed behind by the upper aspect of that part of the OS calcis which projects backwards to form the heel. It varies in length in different individuals; is convex from side to side, concave from before backwards, and corresponds above to a mass of adipose substance placed in front of the tendo Achillis. In the middle of the superior surface are two (sometimes three) articular facets, separated by a broad shallow groove, which is directed obliquely forwards and outwards, and is rough for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the astragalus and os calcis. Of the two articular surfaces, the external is the larger, and situated on the body of the bone : it is of an oblong form, wider behind than in front, and convex from before backwards. The internal articular surface is supported on a projecting process of bone, called the lesser process of the calcaneum {sustentaculmn tali); it is also oblong, concave longitudinally, and sometimes subdivided into two parts, which differ in size and shape. More anteriorly is seen the upper surface of the greater irrocess, marked by a rough depression for the attachment of numerous ligaments, and a tubercle for the origin of the Extensor brevis digitorum muscle. The inferior surface is narrow, rough, uneven, wider behind than in front, and convex from side to side; it is bounded posteriorly by two tubercles, separated by a rough depression; the external, small, prominent, and rounded, gives attach- ment to part of the Abductor minimi digiti; the internal, broader and larger, for the support of the heel, gives attachment, by its prominent inner margin, to the Abductor hallucis, and in front to the Flexor brevis digitorum muscles ; the depression between the tubercles gives attachment to the Abductor minimi digiti and plantar fascia. The rough surface in front oi the tubercles gives attachment to the long plantar ligament, and to the outer head of the Flexor accessorius muscle ; and to a prominent tubercle nearer the anterior part of this surface, as well as to a transverse groove in front of it, is attached the short plantar ligament. The external surface is broad, flat, and almost subcutaneous; it presents near its centre a tubercle, for the attachment of the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. At its upper and anterior part, this surface gives attachment to the external calcaneo-astragaloid ligament; and in front of the tubercle it presents a narrow surface marked by two oblique grooves, separated by an elevated ridge which varies much in size in different bones ; it is named the peroneal ridge, and gives attachment to a fibrous process from the external annular ligament. The superior groove transmits the tendon of the Peroneus brevis ; the inferior, the tendon of the Peroneus longus. The internal surface presents a deep concavity, directed obliquely downwards and forwards, for the transmission of the plantar vessels and nerves into the sole of the foot; it affords attachment to part of the Flexor accessorius muscle. This surface presents an eminence of bone, the lesser process or sustentaculum tali, T275 CALCANEUM which projects horizontally inwards from its upper and fore part, and to which a slip of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus is attached. This process is concave above, and supports the anterior articular surface of the astragalus ; below, it is grooved for the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis. Its free margin is rough for the attachment of part of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. The anterior surface, of a somewhat triangular form, articulates with the cuboid. It is concave .from above, downwards and outwards, and convex in the opposite direction. Its inner border gives attachment to the inferior calcaneo- navicular ligament. The posterior surface is rough, prominent, convex, and wider below than above. Its lower part is rough, for the attachment of the tendo Achillis, and of the Plantaris muscle ; its upper part is smooth, and is covered by a bursa which separates the tendon from the bone. Articulations.—With two bones : the astragalus and cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.—To eight: part of the Tibialis posticus, the tendo Achillis, Plantaris, Abductor hallucis. Abductor minimi digiti. Flexor brevis digi- torum. Flexor accessorius, and Extensor brevis digitorum. The Asteagalus The Astrag-alus {ao-rpdyaXos, a die) is the largest of the tarsal bones, next to the OS calcis. It occupies the middle and upper part of the tarsus, supporting the tibia above, articulating with the malleoli on either side, resting below upon the OS calcis, and joined in front to the navicular. This bone may easily be recognised by its large rounded head, by the broad articular facet on its upper convex surface, or by the two articular facets separated by a deep groove on its under concave surface. It presents six surfaces for examination. The superior surface presents, behind, a broad smooth trochlear surface, for articulation with the tibia. The trochlea is broader in front than behind, convex from before backwards, slightly concave from side to side; in front of it is the upper surface of the neck of the astragalus ; rough for the attachment of ligaments. The inferior surface presents two articular facets separated by a deep groove. The groove runs obliquely forwards and outwards, becoming gradually broader and deeper in front: it corresponds with a similar groove upon the upper surface of the OS calcis, and forms, when articulated with that bone, a canal, filled up in the recent state by the interosseous calcaneo-astragaloid ligament. Of the two articular facets, the posterior is the larger, of an oblong form, and deeply concave from side to side; the anterior, although nearly of equal length, is narrower, of an elongated oval form, convex longitudinally, and often subdivided into two by an elevated ridge; of these the posterior articulates with the lesser process of the os calcis; the anterior, with the upper surface of the inferior calcaneo-navicular liga- ment. The internal surface presents at its upper part a pear-shaped articular facet for the inner malleolus, continuous above with the trochlear surface ; below the articular surface is a rough depression, for the attachment of the deep portion of the internal lateral ligament. The external surface presents a large triangular facet, concave from above downwards, for articulation with the external malleolus ; it is continuous above with the trochlear surface ; and in front of it is a rough depression for the attachment of the anterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. The anterior surface, convex and rounded, forms the head of the astragalus ; it is smooth, of an oval form, and directed obliquely inwards and downwards ; it articulates with the navicular. On its under surface is a small facet, continuous in front with the articular surface of the head, and behind with the smaller facet for the os calcis. This rests on the inferior calcaneo- navicular ligament, being separated from it by the synovial membrane, which is prolonged from the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint to the astragalo-navicular joint. The head is surrounded by a constricted portion, the neck of the astragalus. The posterior surface is narrow, and traversed by a groove, which runs obliquely T 2277 NAVICULAR downwards and inwards, and transmits the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis, external to which is a prominent tubercle, to which the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament is attached. To the inner side of the groove is a second, but less marked tubercle. To ascertain to which foot the bone belongs, hold it with the broad articular surface upwards, and the rounded head forwards ; the lateral triangular articular surface for the external malleolus will then point to the side to which the bone belongs. A.rticulations.—With four bones : tibia, fibula, os calcis, and navicular. The Cuboid The Cuboid {kv/So'?, a cube; elSos, like) bone is placed on the outer side of the foot, in front of the os calcis, and behind the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. It is of a pyramidal shape, its base being directed upwards and inwards, its apex downwards and outwards. It may be distinguished from the other tarsal bones by the existence of a deep groove on its under surface, for the tendon of the Peroneus longus muscle. It presents for examination six surfaces : three articular, and three non-articular. The non-articular surfaces are the superior, inferior, and external. The superior or dorsal surface, directed upwards and outwards, is rough, for the attachment of numerous ligaments. The inferior or plantar surface presents in front a deep groove, which runs obliquely from without, forwards and inwards ; it lodges the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and is bounded behind by a prominent ridge, to which is attached the long calcaneo-cuboid ligament. The ridge termi- nates externally in an eminence, the tuberosity of the cuboid, the surface of which presents a convex facet, for articulation with the sesamoid bone of the tendon contained in the groove. The surface of bone behind the groove is rough, for the attachment of the short plantar ligament, a few fibres of the Flexor brevis hallucis and a fasciculus from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. The external surface, the smallest and narrowest of the three, presents a deep notch formed by the commence- ment of the peroneal groove. The articular surfaces are the posterior, anterior, and internal. The posterior surface is smooth, triangular, and concavo-convex, for articulation with the anterior surface of the os calcis. The anterior, of smaller size, but also irregularly trian- gular, is divided by a vertical ridge into two facets : the inner one, quadrilateral in form, articulates with the fourth metatarsal bone ; the outer one, larger and more triangular, articulates with the fifth metatarsal. The internal surface is broad, rough, irregularly quadrilateral, presenting at its middle and upper part a smooth oval facet, for articulation with the external cuneiform bone ; and behind this (occasionally) a smaller facet, for articulation with the navicular; it is rough in the rest of its extent, for the attachment of strong interosseous ligaments. To ascertain to which foot the bone belongs, hold it so that its under surface, marked by the peroneal groove, looks downwards, and the large concavo-convex articular surface backwards, towards the holder : the narrow non-articular surface, marked by the commencement of the peroneal groove, will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : the os calcis, external cuneiform, and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones ; occasionally with the navicular. Attachment of Muscles.—Part of the Flexor brevis hallucis and a slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. The Naviculae The Navicular or Scaphoid bone is situated at the inner side of the tarsus, between the astragalus behind and the three cuneiform bones in front. It may be distinguished by its form, being concave behind, convex and subdivided into three facets in front.THE SKELETON 278 The anterior surface, of an oblong form, is convex from side to side, and sub- divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the three cuneiform bones. The posterior surface is oval, concave, broader externally than internally, and articulates with the rounded head of the astragalus. The superior surface is convex from side to side, and rough for the attachment of ligaaiients. The inferior is irregular, and also rough for the attachment of ligaments. The internal surface presents a rounded tubercular eminence, the tuberosity of the navicular, the lower part of which projects, and gives attachment to part of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. The external surface is rough, and irregular, for the attachment of ligamentous fibres, and occasionally presents a small facet for articulation with the cuboid bone. To ascertain to which foot the bone belongs, hold it with the concave articular surface backwards, and the convex dorsal surface upwards ; the external surface, i.e. the surface opposite the tubercle, will point to the side to which the bone belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : astragalus and three cuneiform ; occasionally also with the cuboid. Attachment of Muscles.—Part of the Tibialis posticus. The Cuneiform Bones The Cuneiform Bones have received their name from their wedge-like shape (cuneus, a tuedge; forma, likeness). They form, with the cuboid, the anterior row of the tarsus, being placed between the navicular behind, the three innermost metatarsal bones in front, and the cuboid externally. They are called the first, second, and third, counting from the inner to the outer side of the foot, and, from their position, internal, middle, and external. The Internal Cuneiform The Internal Cuneiform is the largest of the three. It is situated at the inner side of the foot, between the navicular behind and the base of the first metatarsal in front. It may be distinguished from the other two by its large size, and its more irregular, wedge-like form. Without the others, it may be known by the large kidney-shaped anterior articulating surface, and by the prominence on the inferior or plantar surface for the attachment of the Tibialis posticus. It presents for examination six surfaces. The internal surface is subcutaneous, and forms part of the inner border of the foot; it is broad, quadrilateral, and presents at its anterior inferior angle a smooth oval facet, into which the tendon of the Tibialis anticus is partially inserted; in the rest of its extent it is rough, for the attachment of ligaments. The exterjial surface is concave, presenting, along its superior and posterior borders, a narrow reversed L-shaped surface for articulation with the middle cuneiform behind, and second metatarsal bone in front: in the rest of its extent, it is rough for the attachment of Ugaments and part of the tendon of the Peroneus longus. The anterior surface, kidney-shaped, much larger than the posterior, articulates with the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The posterior surface is triangular, concave, and articulates Avith the innermost and largest of the three facets on the anterior surface of the navicular. The inferior or pla^itar surface is rough, and presents a prominent tuberosity at its back part for the attachment of part of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. It also gives attachment in front to part of the tendon of the Tibialis anticus. The superior surface is the narrow pointed end of the wedge, which is directed upwards and outwards ; it is rough for the attachment of ligaments. To ascertain to Avhich side the bone belongs, hold it so that its superior narrow edge looks upwards, and the long, kidney-shaped, articular surface forwards ; the279 EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM external surface, marked by its vertical and horizontal articub^r facets, will point to the side to which it belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : navicular, middle cuneiform, first and second metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To three: the Tibialis anticus and posticus, and Peroneus longus. The Middle Cuneifoem The Middle Cuneiform, the smallest of the three, is of very regular wedge-like form, the broad extremity being placed upwards, the narrow end downwards. It is situated between the other two bones of the same name, and articulates with the navicular behind, and the second metatarsal in front. It may be distinguished from the external cuneiform bone, which it much resembles in general appearance, by the articular facet, of angular form, which runs round the upper and back part of its inner surface; and if the two bones from the same foot are together, the middle cuneiform is much the smaller. The anterior surface, triangular in form, and narrower than the posterior, articulates with the base of the second metatarsal bone. The posterior surface, also triangular, articulates with the navicular. The internal surface presents a reversed L-shaped articular facet, running along the superior and posterior borders, for articulation with the internal cuneiform, and is rough in the rest of its extent for the attachment of ligaments. The external surface presents posteriorly a smooth facet for articulation with the external cuneiform bone. The superior surface forms the base of the wedge ; it is quadrilateral, broader behind than in front, and rough for the attachment of ligaments. The inferior surface, pointed and tubercular, is also rough for ligamentous attachment, and for the insertion of a slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. To ascertain to which foot the bone belongs, hold its superior or dorsal surface upwards, the broadest edge being towards the holder: the smooth facet (limited to the posterior border) will then point to the side to which it belongs. Articulations.—With four bones : navicular, internal and external cuneiform, and second metatarsal bone. Attachment of Muscle.—A slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus is attached to this bone. The External Cuneiform The External Cuneiform, intermediate in size between the two preceding, is of a very regular wedge-like form, the broad extremity being placed upwards, the narrow end downwards. It occupies the centre of the front row of the tarsus between the middle cuneiform internally, the cuboid externally, the navicular behind, and the third metatarsal in front. It is distinguished from the internal cuneiform bone by its more regular wedge-like shape, and by the absence of the kidney-shaped articular surface : from the middle cuneiform, by the absence of the reversed L-shaped facet, and by the two articular facets which are present on both its inner and outer surfaces. It has six surfaces for examination. The anterior surface, triangular in form, articulates with the third metatarsal bone. The posterior surface articulates with the most external facet of the navicular, and is rough below for the attachment of ligamentous fibres. The internal surface presents two articular facets, separated by a rough depression ; the anterior one, sometimes divided into two, articulates with the outer side of the base of the second metatarsal bone ; the posterior one skirts the posterior border, and articulates with the middle cuneiform ; the rough depression between the two gives attachment to an interosseous ligament. The external surface also presents two articular facets, separated by a rough non-articular surface ; the anterior facet, situated at the superior angle of the bone, is small, and articulates with the inner side of the base of the fourth metatarsal; the posterior and larger one articulatesTHE SKELETON 28o with the cuboid ; the rough, non-articular surface serves for the attachment of an interosseous hgament. The three facets for articulation with the three metatarsal bones are continuous with one another, and covered by a prolongation of the same cartilage ; the facets for articulation with the middle cuneiform and navicular are also continuous, but that for articulation with the cuboid is usually separate. The superior or dorsal surface is of an oblong square form ; its posterior external angle being prolonged backwards. The inferior or plantar surface is an obtuse rounded margin, and serves for the attachment of part of the tendon of the Tibiahs posticus, part of the Flexor brevis hallucis, and ligaments. To ascertain to which side the bone belongs, hold it with the broad dorsal surface upw^ards, the prolonged edge backwards ; the separate articular facet for the cuboid will point to the proper side. Articulations.—With six bones : the navicular, middle cuneiform, cuboid, and second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—To two : part of the Tibialis posticus, and Flexor brevis hallucis. The Metatarsal Bones The Metatarsal Bones are five in number ; they are long bones, and present for examination a shaft and two extremities. Common Characters.—The shaft is prismoid in form, tapers gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is slightly curved longitudinally, so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. The posterior extremity, or base, is wedge-shaped, articulating by its terminal surface with the tarsal bones, and by its lateral surfaces with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces being rough for the attachment of ligaments. The anterior extremity, or head, presents a terminal rounded articular surface, oblong from above downwards, and extending further backwards below than above. Its sides are flattened, and present a depression, surmounted by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. Its under surface is grooved in the middle line for the passage of the Flexor tendon, and marked on each side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface. Peculiar Characters.—The First is remarkable for its great thickness, but is the shortest of all the metatarsal bones. The shaft is strong, and of Avell-marked prismoid form. The posterior extremity presents no lateral articular facets ; its terminal articular surface is of large size, kidney-shaped; its circumference is grooved, for the tarso-metatarsal ligaments, and internally gives attachment to part of the tendon of the Tibialis anticus ; its inferior angle presents a rough oval prominence for the insertion of the tendon of the Peroneus longus. The head is of large size ; on its plantar surface are two grooved facets, over which glide sesamoid bones ; the facets are separated by a smooth elevated ridge. This bone is known by the single kidney-shaped articular surface on its base ; the deeply grooved appearance of the plantar surface of its head ; and its great thickness, relatively to its length. When it is placed in its natural position, the concave border of the kidney-shaped articular surface on its base points to the side to which the bone belongs. The Second is the longest and largest of the remaining metatarsal bones, being prolonged backwards into the recess formed between the three cuneiform bones. Its tarsal extremity is broad above, narrow and rough below. It presents four articular surfaces: one behind, of a triangular form, for articulation with the middle cuneiform ; one at the upper part of its internal lateral surface, for articu- lation with the internal cuneiform ; and two on its external lateral surface, a posterior and anterior, separated by a vertical ridge. Each of these external articular surfaces is divided by a rough depression into two parts ; the two anterior facets articulate with the third metatarsal; the two posterior (sometimes continuous) with the external cuneiform. The facets on the tarsal extremity of the second metatarsal bone serve at oncePHALANGES 281 to distinguish it from the rest, and to indicate the foot to which it belongs ; there being one facet at the upper angle of the internal surface, and two facets, each subdivided into two parts, on the external surface, pointing to the side to which the bone belongs. The fact that the two posterior subdivisions of these external facets sometimes run into one should not be forgotten. The Third articulates behind, by means of a triangular smooth surface, with the external cuneiform; on its inner side, by two facets, with the second meta- tarsal ; and on its outer side, by a single facet, with the fourth metatarsal. The latter facet is of circular form, and situated at the upper angle of the base. The third metatarsal is known by its having at its tarsal end two undivided facets on the inner side, and a single facet on the outer. This distinguishes it from the second metatarsal, in which the two facets, found on one side of its tarsal end, are each subdivided into two. The single facet (when the bone is put in its natural position) is on the side to which the bone belongs. The Fourth is smaller in size than the preceding; its tarsal extremity presents a terminal quadrilateral surface, for articulation with the cuboid ; a smooth facet on the inner side, divided by a ridge into an anterior portion for articulation with the third metatarsal, and a posterior portion for articulation with the external cuneiform ; on the outer side a single facet, for articulation with the fifth meta- tarsal. The fourth metatarsal is known by its having a single facet on either side of the tarsal extremity, that on the inner side being divided into two parts. If this subdivision be not recognisable, the fact that its tarsal end is bent somewhat outwards will indicate the side to which it belongs. The Fifth is recognised by the tubercular eminence on the outer side of its base. It articulates behind, by a triangular surface cut obliquely from without inwards, with the cuboid ; and internally, with the fourth metatarsal. The projection on the outer side of this bone at its tarsal end at once disi^in- guishes it from the others, and points to the side to which it belongs. Articulations.—Each bone articulates with the tarsal bones by one extremity, and by the other with the first row of phalanges. The number of tarsal bones with which each metatarsal articulates, is one for the first, three for the second, one for the third, two for the fourth, and one for the fifth. Attachment of Muscles.—To the first metatarsal bone, three : part of the Tibialis anticus, the Peroneus longus, and First dorsal interosseous. To the second, four: the Adductor obliquus hallucis, and First and Second dorsal inter- osseous, and a slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, and occasionally a slip from the Peroneus longus. To the third, five: the Adductor obliquus hallucis. Second and Third dorsal, and First plantar interosseous, and a slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. To the fourth, five : the Adductor obliquus hallucis. Third and Fourth dorsal, and Second plantar interosseous, and a slip from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. To the fifth, six : the Peroneus brevis, Peroneus tertius, Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Adductor transversus hallucis. Fourth dorsal, and Third plantar interosseous. Phalanges The Phalanges of the foot, both in number and general arrangement, resemble those in the hand; there being two in the great toe, and three in each of the other toes. The phalanges of ih.Q first roio resemble closely those of the hand. The shaft is compressed from side to side, convex above, concave below. The ijosterior extremity is concave ; and the anterior extremity presents a trochlear surface, for articulation with the second phalanges. The phalanges of the second roio are remarkably small and short, but rather broader than those of the first row. The ungual phalanges, in form, resemble those of the fingers; but they are smaller, flattened from above downwards, presenting a broad base for articulation282 THE SKELETON' with the second row, and an expanded extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe. Articulation.—The first row, with the metatarsal bones behind, and second phalanges in front ; the second row, of the four outer toes, with the first and third phalanges ; of the great toe, with the first phalanx ; the third row, of the four outer toes, with the second phalanges. Attachment of Muscles.—To the first phalanges. Great toe, five muscles : innermost tendon of Extensor brevis digitorum, Abductor hallucis, Adductor obliquus hallucis. Flexor brevis hallucis, Adductor transversus hallucis. Second Fig. 226.—Plan of the development of the foot. \/WT\^!^^'\~~ -'i^'i^ea^'s Vdtli year ; Jy/M/y \ unites after puberty TAESUS.

The centres make their appear- ance in the following order : os calcis, at the sixth month of foetal life ; astragalus, about the seventh month ; cuboid, at the ninth month ; external cuneiform, during the first year ; internal cuneiform in the third year; middle cuneiform and navicular in the fourth year. The epiphysis for the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis appears at the tenth year, and unites with the rest of the bone soon after puberty. The Metatarsal bones are each developed by tioo centres: one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, in the four outer metatarsal; one for the shaft, and one for the base, in the metatarsal bone of the great toe.* Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the ninth week, and extends towards either extremity. The centre in the proximal end of the first metatarsal bone appears about the third year ; the centre in the distal end of the other bones between the fifth and eighth year ; they become joined between the eighteenth and twentieth years. The Phalanges are developed by tioo centres for each bone : one for the shaft, and one for the metatarsal extremity. Construction of the Foot as a Whole The foot is constructed on the same principles as the hand, but modified to form a firm basis of support for the rest of the body when in the erect position. It is more solidly constructed, and its component parts are less movable on each other than in the hand. This is especially the case with the great toe, which has to assist in supporting the body and is therefore constructed with greater solidity; it lies parallel with the other toes, and has a very limited degree of mobility, whereas the thumb, which is occupied in numerous and varied movements, is constructed in such a manner as to permit of great mobility. Its metacarpal bone is directed away from the others, so as to form an acute angle with the second, and it enjoys a considerable range of motion at its articulation with the carpus. The foot is placed at right angles to the leg—a position which is almost peculiar to man, and has relation to the erect position which he maintains. In order to allow of its supporting the weight of the whole body in this position, with the least expenditure of material, it is constructed in the form of an arch. This arch is not, however, made up of two equal limbs. The hinder one, which is made up of the os calcis and the posterior part of the astragalus, is about half the length of the anterior limb, and measures about three inches. The anterior limb consists of the rest of the tarsal and the metatarsal bones, and measures about six inches. It may be said to consist of two parts, an inner segment made up of the head of the astragalus, the navicular, the three cuneiform, and the three inner metatarsal bones ; and an outer segment composed of the cuboid and the two outer metatarsal bones. The summit of the arch is at the superior articular surface of the astragalus ; and its two extremities, that is to say the two points on which the arch rests in standing, are the tubercles on the under surface of the os calcis posteriorly, and the heads of the metatarsal bones anteriorly. The weakest part of the arch is the joint between the astragalus and scaphoid, and here it is more liable to yield in those who are overweighted, and in those in Avhom the ligaments which complete and preserve the arch are relaxed. This weak point in the arch is braced on its concave surface by the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament, which is more elastic than most other ligaments, and thus allows the arch to yield from jars or shocks applied to the anterior portion of the foot and quickly restores it to its pristine condition. This ligament is supported on its under surface by the tendon of the Tibialis posticus * As was noted in the first metacarpal bone, so in the first metatarsal, there is often to be observed a tendency to the formation of a second epiphysis in the distal extremity (see footnote, p. 244).284 THE SKELETON muscle, which is spread out into a fan-shaped insertion, and prevents undue tension of the Ugament or such an amount of stretching as would permanently elongate it. In addition to this longitudinal arch the foot presents a transverse arch, at the anterior part of the tarsus and hinder part of the metatarsus. This, however, can scarcely be described as a true arch, but presents more the character of a half-dome. The inner border of the central portion of the longitudinal arch is elevated from the ground, and from this point the bones arch over to the outer border, which is in contact with the ground, and, assisted by the longitudinal arch, produce a sort of rounded niche on the inner side of the foot, which gives the appearance of a transverse as well as a longitudinal arch. The arch of the foot, from the point of the heel to the toes, is not quite straight, but is directed a little outwards, so that the inner border is a little convex and the outer border concave. This disposition of the bones becomes more marked when the longitudinal arch of the foot is lost, as in the disease known under the name of ' flat-foot.' Surface Form.—On the dorsimi of the foot the individual bones are not to be distinguished, with the exception of the head of the astragalus, which forms a rounded projection in front of the ankle-joint when the foot is forcibly extended. The whole surface forms a smooth convex outline, the summit of which is the ridge formed by the head of the astragalus, the navicular, the middle cuneiform, and the second metatarsal bones ; from this it gradually inclines outwards and more rapidly inwards. On the inner side of the foot, the internal tuberosity of the os calcis and the ridge separating the inner from the posterior surface of the bone may be felt most posteriorly. In front of this, and below the internal malleolus, may be felt the projection of the sustentaculum tali. Passing forwards is the well-marked tuberosity of the navicular bone, situated about an inch or an inch and a quarter in front of the internal malleolus. Further towards the front, the ridge formed by the base of the first metatarsal bone can be obscurely felt, and from this the shaft of the bone can be traced to the expanded head articulating with the base of the hrst phalanx of the great toe. Immediately beneath the base of this phalanx, the internal sesamoid bone is to be felt. Lastly, the expanded ends of the bones forming the last joint of the great toe are to be felt. On the outer side of the foot the most posterior bony point is the outer tuberosity of the os calcis, with the ridge separating the posterior from the outer surface of the bone. In front of this the greater part of the external surface of the OS calcis is subcutaneous; on it, below and in front of the external malleolus, may be felt the peroneal ridge, when this process is present. Farther forwards, the base of the fifth metatarsal bone forms a prominent and well-defined landmark, and in front of this the shaft of the bone, with its expanded head, and the base of the first phalanx may be defined. The sole of the foot is almost entirel}^ covered l^y soft parts, so that but few bony parts are to be made out, and these somewhat obscurely. The hinder part of the under surface of the os calcis and the heads of the metatarsal bones, with the exception of the first, which is concealed by the sesamoid bones, may be recognised. Surgical Anatomy.—Considering the injuries to which the foot is subjected, it is surprising how seldom the tarsal bones are fractured. This is no doubt due to the fact that the tarsus is composed of a number of bones, articulated by a considerable extent of surface and joined together b}^ ver}^ strong ligaments, which serve to break the force of violence applied to this part of the body. When fracture does occur, these bones, being composed for the most part of a soft cancellous structure, covered only by a thin shell of compact tissue, are often extensively comminuted, especially as most of the fractmes are produced by direct violence. And having only a very scanty amount of soft parts over them, the fractm-es are very often compoimd, and amputation is frequently necessary. When fracture occm^s in the anterior group of tarsal bones, it is almost invariably the result of direct violence; but fractm^es of the posterior group, that is, of the calcaneum and astragalus, are most frequently produced by falls from a height on to the feet; though fracture of the os calcis may be caused by direct violence or by nniscular action. The posterior part of the bone, that is, the part behind the articular sm-faces, is almost always the seat of the fracture, though some few cases of fracture of the sustentaculum tali and of vertical fracture between the two articulating facets have been recorded. The neck of the astragalus, being the weakest part of the bone, is most frequently fractured, though fractures may occur in any part and almost in any direction, either associated or not with fractiu-e of other bones. In cases of club foot, especially in congenital cases, the bones of the tarsus become altered in shape and size, and displaced from their proper positions. This is especially the case in congenital equino-varus, in which the astragalus, particularly about the head, becomes twisted and atrophied, and a similar condition may be present in the other bones, more especially the navicidar. The tarsal bones are peculiarly liable to become the seatSESAMOID BONES of tubercular caries from comparatively trivial in]\iries. There are several reasons to accomit for this. They are composed of a delicate cancellated structure, surrounded by intricate synovial membranes. They are situated at the fiu"thest point from the central organ of the circulation and exposed to vicissitudes of temperature ; and, moreover, on their dorsal surface are thinly clad with soft parts which have but a scanty blood-supply. And finally, after slight injuries, they are not maintained in a condition of rest to the same extent as similar injuries in some other parts of the body. Caries of the calcaneum and astragalus may remain limited to the one bone for a long period, but when one of the other bones is affected, the remainder frequently become involved, in consequence of the disease spreading through the large and complicated synovial membrane which is more or less common to these bones. Amputation of the whole or a part of the foot is frequently required either for injury or disease. The principal amputations are as follow : (i) Syme's : amputation at the ankle- joint by a heel-flap, with removal of the malleoli and sometimes a thin slice from the lower end of the tibia. (2) Koux's : amputation at the ankle-joint by a large internal flap. (3) Pirogoff's amputation : removal of the whole of the tarsal bones, except the posterior part of the os calcis and a thin slice from the tibia and fibula including the two malleoli. The sawn sm^face of the os calcis is then tiu'ned up and united to the similar surface of the tibia. (4) Subastragaloid amputation : removal of the foot below the astragalus through the joint between it and the os calcis. This operation has been modified by Hancock, who leaves the posterior third of the os calcis and turns it up against the denuded surface of the astragalus. This latier operation is of doubtful utility and is rarely performed. (5) Chopart's or medio-tarsal: removal of the anterior part of the foot with all the tarsal bones except the os calcis and astragalus; disarticulation being effected through the joints between the scaphoid and cuboid in front, and the astragalus and os calcis behind. (6) Lisfranc's: amputation of the anterior part of the foot through the tarso-metatarsal joints. This has been modified by Hey, who disarticulated through the joints of the four outer metatarsal bones with the tarsus, and sawed off the projecting internal cuneiform ; and by Skey, who sawed off the base of the second metatarsal bone and disarticulated the others. The bones of the tarsus occasionally require removal individually. This is especially the case with the astragalus and os calcis for disease limited to the one bone, or again the astragalus may require excision in cases of subastragaloid dislocation, or, as recommended by Mr. Lund, in cases of inveterate talipes. The cuboid has been removed for the same reason by Mr. Solly. But both these two latter operations have fallen very much into disuse, and have been superseded by resection of a wedge-shaped piece of bone from the outer side of the tarsus. Finally, Mickulicz and Watson have devised operations for the removal of more extensive portions of the tarsus. Mickulicz's operation consists in the removal of the os calcis and astragalus, along with the articular surfaces of the tibia and fibula, and also of the scaphoid and cuboid. The remaining portion of the tarsus is then brought into contact with the sawn surfaces of the tibia and fibula, and fixed there. The result is a position of the shortened foot resembling talipes equinus. Watson's operation is adapted to those cases where the disease is confined to the anterior tarsal bones. By two lateral incisions he saws through the bases of the metatarsal bones in front and opens up the joints between the scaphoid and astragalus, and the cuboid and os calcis, and removes the intervening bones. The metatarsal bones and phalanges are nearly always broken by direct violence, and in the majority of casds the injury is the result of severe crushing accidents, necessitating amputation. The metatarsal bones and especially the one of the great toe, are frequently diseased, either in tubercular subjects or in perforating ulcer of the foot. Sesamoid Bones These are small rounded masses, cartilaginous in early life, osseous in the adult, which are developed in those tendons which exert a great amount of pressure upon the parts over which they glide. It is said that they are more commonly found in the male than in the female, and in persons of an active muscular habit than in those who are weak and debilitated. They are invested throughout their whole surface by the fibrous tissue of the tendon in which they are found, excepting upon that side which lies in contact with the part over which they play, where they present a free articular facet. They may be divided into two kinds : those which glide over the articular surfaces of joints, and those which play over the cartila- ginous facets found on the surfaces of certain bones. The sesamoid bones of the joints in the upper extremity, are two on the palmar surface of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint in the thumb, developed in the tendons of the Flexor brevis poUicis; occasionally one or two opposite the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations of the fore and little fingers ; and, still more rarely, one286 THE SKELETON opposite the same joints of the third and fourth fingers. In the lower extremity, the patella, which is developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor ; two small sesamoid bones, found in the tendons of the Flexor brevis hallucis, opposite the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe ; and occasionally one in the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the second toe, the little toe, and, still more rarely, the third and fourth toes. Those found in the tendons which glide over certain bones occupy the following situations : one sometimes found in the tendon of the Biceps cubiti, opposite the tuberosity of the radius ; one in the tendon of the Peroneus longus, where it glides through the groove in the cuboid bone ; one appears late in life in the tendon of the Tibialis anticus, opposite the smooth facet of the internal cuneiform bone ; one is found in the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, opposite the inner side of the head of the astragalus ; one in the outer head of the Gastrocnemius, behind the outer condyle of the femur; and one in the conjoined tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus, where it glides over the os pubis. Sesamoid bones are found occasionally in the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, as it passes over the great trochanter; and in the tendons which wind round the inner and outer malleoli.THE AETICULATIONS THE various bones of which the Skeleton consists are connected together at different parts of their surfaces, and such a connection is designated by the name of Joint or Articulation. If the joint is immovable, as between the cranial and most of the facial bones, the adjacent margins of the bones are applied in almost close contact, a thin layer of fibrous membrane, the sutural ligament, and, at the base of the skull, in certain situations, a thin layer of cartilage being interposed. Where slight movement is required, combined with great strength, the osseous surfaces are united by tough and elastic fibro-cartilages, as in the joints of the spine, the sacro-iliac and interpubic articulations ; but in the movable joints, the bones forming the articulation are generally expanded for greater convenience of mutual connection, covered by cartilage, held together by strong bands or capsules of fibrous tissue, called ligaments, and partially lined by a membrane, the synovial membrane, which secretes a fluid to lubricate the various parts of which the joint is formed : so that the structures which enter into the formation of a joint are bone, cartilage, fibro-cartilage, ligament, and synovial membrane. Bone constitutes the fundamental element of all the joints. In the long bones, the extremities are the parts which form the articulations ; they are generally somewhat enlarged, consisting of spongy cancellous tissue, with a thin coating of compact substance. In the flat bones, the articulations usually take place at the edges ; and, in the short bones, at various parts of their surface. The layer of compact bone which forms the articular surface, and to which the cartilage is attached, is called the articular lamella. It is of a white colour, extremely dense, and varies in thickness. Its structure differs from ordinary bone-tissue in this respect, that it contains no Haversian canals, and its lacunae are much larger than in ordinary bone, and have no canaliculi. The vessels of the cancellous tissue, as they approach the articular lamella, turn back in loops, and do not perforate it; this layer is consequently more dense and firmer than ordinary bone, and is evidently designed to form a firm and unyielding support for the articular cartilage. The cartilage, which covers the articular surfaces of bone, and is called artic- ular, will be found described, with the other varieties of cartilage, in the section on General Anatomy (page 19). Ligaments consist of bands of various forms, serving to connect together the articular extremities of bones, and composed mainly of bundles of lohite fibrous tissue placed parallel with, or closely interlaced with, one another, and presenting a white, shining silvery aspect. A ligament is pliant and flexible, so as to allow of the most perfect freedom of movement, but strong, tough, and inextensile, so as not readily to yield under the most severely applied force ; it is consequently well adapted to serve as the connecting medium between the bones. Some ligaments consist entirely of yelloiu elastic tissue, as the ligamenta subflava, which connect together the adjacent arches of the vertebrae, and the ligamentum nuchae in the lower animals. In these cases it will be observed that the elasticity of the ligament is intended to act as a substitute for muscular power. Synovial membrane is a thin, delicate membrane of connective tissue, with branched connective-tissue corpuscles. Its secretion is thick, viscid, and glairy, like the white of egg ; and is hence termed synovia. The synovial membranes found in the body admit of subdivision into three kinds—articular, bursal, and vaginal. The articular synovial membranes are found in all the freely movable joints. In the foetus this membrane is said, by Toynbee, to be continued over the surfaceARTICULATIONS 288 of the cartilages ; but in the adult it is wanting, excepting at their circumference, upon which it encroaches for a short distance and to which it is firmly attached : it then invests the inner surface of the capsular or other ligaments enclosing the joint and is reflected over the surface of any tendons passing through its cavity, as the tendon of the Popliteus in the knee, and the tendon of the Biceps in the shoulder. Hence the articular synovial membrane may be regarded as a short wide tube, attached by its open ends to the margins of the articular cartilages and covering the inner surface of the various ligaments which connect the articular surfaces, so that along with the cartilages it completely encloses the joint cavity. In some of the joints the synovial membrane is thrown into folds, which pass across the cavity. They are called synovial ligaments, and are especially distinct in the knee. In other joints there are flattened folds, subdivided at their margins into fringe-like processes, the vessels of which have a convoluted arrangement. These latter generally project from the synovial membrane near the margin of the cartilage, and lie Hat upon its surface. They consist of connective tissue, covered with endothelium, and contain fat-cells in variable quantities, and, more rarely, isolated cartilage-cells. The larger folds often contain considerable quantities of fat. They were described, by Clopton Havers, as mucilaginous glands, and as the source of the synovial secretion. Under certain diseased conditions, similar processes are found covering the entire surface of the synovial membrane, forming a mass of pedunculated fibro-fatty growths, which project into the joint. Similar structures are also found in some of the bursal and vaginal synovial membranes. The bursal synovial membranes are found interposed between surfaces which move upon each other, producing friction, as in the gliding of a tendon, or of the integument over projecting bony surfaces. They admit of subdivision into two kinds, the bursce mucosce and the burscB synovice. The bursce mucosce are large, simple, or irregular cavities in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, enclosing a clear viscid fluid. They are found in various situations, as between the integument and the front of the patella, over the olecranon, the malleoli, and other prominent parts. The bursce synovice are found interposed between muscles or tendons as they play over projecting bony surfaces, as between the Glutei muscles and the surface of the great trochanter. They consist of a thin wall of connective tissue, partially covered by patches of cells, and contain a viscid fluid. Where one of these exists in the neighbourhood of a joint, it usually communicates with its cavity, as is gene- rally the case with the bursa between the tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus and the capsular ligament of the hip, or the one interposed between the under surface of the Subscapularis and the neck of the scapula. Th.Q vaginal synovial membranes {synovial sheaths) serve to facilitate the gliding of tendons in the osseo-fibrous canals through which they pass. The membrane is here arranged in the form of a sheath, one layer of which adheres to the wall of the canal, and the other is reflected upon the surface of the contained tendon ; the space between the two free surfaces of the membrane being partially filled with synovia. These sheaths are chiefly found surrounding the tendons of the flexor and extensor muscles of the fingers and toes, as they pass through the osseo-fibrous canals in the hand or foot. Synovia is a transparent, yellowish-white, or slightly reddish fluid, viscid like the white of egg, having an alkaline reaction and slightly saline taste. It consists, according to Frerichs, in the ox, of 94*85 water, 0-56 mucus and epithelium, 0*07 fat, 3*51 albumen and extractive matter, and 0*99 salts. The articulations are divided into three classes: synarthrosis, or immovable ; amphiarthrosis, or mixed ; and diarthrosis, or movable joints. I. Synaethkosis. Immovable Articulations Synarthrosis includes all those articulations in which the surfaces of the bones are in almost direct contact, fastened together by an intervening mass of connective tissue, and in which there is no appreciable motion, as the joints between the bonesCLASSIFICATION OF JOINTS 289 of the cranium and face, excepting those of the lower jaw. The varieties of synar- throsis are four in number : Sutura, Schindylesis, Gomphosis, and Synchondrosis. Sutura {a seam) is that form of articulation where the contiguous margins of flat bones are united by a thin layer of fibrous tissue. It is met with only in the skull. Where the articulating surfaces are connected by a series of processes and indentations interlocked together, it is termed sutura vera; of which there are three varieties : sutura dentata, serrata, and limbosa. The surfaces of the bones are not in direct contact, being separated by a layer of membrane, continuous externally with the pericranium, internally with the dura mater. The sutura dentata (dens, a tooth) is so called from the tooth-like form of the projecting articular processes, as in the suture between the parietal bones. In the sutura serrata (serra, a saiu) the edges of the two bones forming the articulation are serrated like the teeth of a fine saw, as between the two portions of the frontal bone. In the sutura limhosa (limbus, a selvage), besides the dentated processes, there is a certain degree of bevelling of the articular surfaces, so that the bones overlap one another, as in the suture between the parietal and frontal bones. When the articulation is formed by roughened surfaces placed in apposition with one another, it is termed the false suture (sutura notha), of which there are two kinds, the sutura, squamosa (squama, a scale), formed by the overlapping of two contiguous bones by broad bevelled margins, as in the squamo-parietal (squamous) suture ; and the sutura harmonia (dp/x,ovta, a joming together), where there is simple apposition of two contiguous rough bony surfaces, as in the articulation between the two superior maxillary bones, or of the horizontal plates of the palate bones. Schindylesis [crxtv^vX-qcn';, a fissure) is that form of articulation in which a thin plate of bone is received into a cleft or fissure formed by the separation of two laminae in another bone, as in the articulation of the rostrum of the sphenoid and perpendicular plate of the ethmoid with the vomer, or in the reception of the latter in the fissure between the superior maxillary and palate bones. Gomphosis (yo/x(^o?, a nail) is an articulation formed by the insertion of a conical process into a socket, as a nail is driven into a board ; this is not illustrated by any articulation between bones, properly so called, but is seen in the articulation of the teeth with the alveoli of the maxillary bones. Synchrondrosis.—Where the connecting medium is cartilage the joint is termed a synchondrosis. This is a temporary form of joint, for the cartilage becomes con- verted into bone before adult life. Such a joint is found between the epiphyses and shafts of long bones. 2. Amphiaethrosis. Mixed Articulations In this form of articulation, the contiguous osseous surfaces are either con- nected together by broad flattened discs of fibro-cartilage, of a more or less complex structure, which adhere to the end of each bone, as in the articulation between the bodies of the vertebras, and the sacro-iliac and pubic symphyses. This is termed Symphysis. Or, secondly, the bony surfaces are united by an interosseous ligament, as in the inferior tibio-fibular articulation. To this the term Syndesmosis is applied. 3. DiARTHEOsis. Movable Articulations This form of articulation includes the greater number of the joints in the body, mobility being their distinguishing character. They are formed by the approxi- mation of two contiguous bony surfaces, covered with cartilage, connected by ligaments, and lined by synovial membrane. The varieties of joints in this class have been determined by the kind of motion permitted in each. There are two varieties in which the movement is uniaxial, that is to say, all movements take place around one axis. In one form, the Ginglymus, this axis is practically speaking transverse; in the other, the trochoid or pivot-joint, it is longitudinal. There are two varieties where the movement is biaxial, or around two horizontal U290 ARTICULATIONS axes at right angles to each other, or at any intervening axis between the two. These are the condyloid and saddle-joint. There is one form of joint where the movement is polyaxial, the enarthrosis or ball-and-socket joint. And finally there are the Artlirodia or Gliding joints. Ginglymus or Hinge-joint (yLyyXvfxo<;, a hinge).—In this form of joint the articular sm'faces are moulded to each other in such a manner as to permit motion only in one plane, forwards and backwards ; the extent of motion at the same time being considerable. The direction which the distal bone takes in this motion is never in the same plane as that of the axis of the proximal bone, but there is always a certain amount of alteration from the straight line during flexion. The articular surfaces are connected together by strong lateral ligaments, which form their chief bond of union. The most perfect forms of gingiymus are the inter- phalangeal joints and the joint between the humerus and ulna; the knee and ankle are less perfect, as they allow a slight degree of rotation or lateral movement in certain positions of the limb. Trochoides (pivot-joint).—Where the movement is limited to rotation, the joint is formed by a pivot-like process turning within a ring, or the ring on the pivot, the ring being formed partly of bone, partly of ligament. In the superior radio-ulnar articulation, the ring is formed partly by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna ; in the rest of its extent, by the orbicular ligament; here, the head of the radius rotates within the ring. In the articulation of the odontoid process of the axis with the atlas, the ring is formed in front by the anterior arch of the atlas ; behind, by the transverse ligament ; here the ring rotates round the odontoid process. Condyloid Articulations.—In this form of joint, an ovoid articular head, or condyle, is received into an elliptical cavity in such a manner as to permit of flexion and extension, adduction and abduction and circumduction, but no axial rotation. The articular surfaces are connected together by anterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. An example of this form of joint is found in the wrist. Articulations by Reciprocal Reception (saddle-joint).—In this variety, the articular surfaces are concavo-convex ; that is to say, they are inversely convex in one direction and concave in the other. The movements are the same as in the preceding form ; that is to say, there is flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction, but no axial rotation. The articular surfaces are connected by a capsular ligament. The best example of this form of joint is the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb. Enarthrosis is that form of joint in which the distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes, which have one common centre. It is formed by the reception of a globular head into a deep cup-like cavity (hence the name ' ball-and-socket '), the parts being kept in apposition by a capsular ligament strengthened by accessory hgamentous bands. Examples of this form of articulation are found in the hip and shoulder. Arthrodia is that form of joint which admits of a gliding movement; it is formed by the approximation of plane surfaces, or one slightly concave, the other slightly convex; the amount of motion between them being limited by the ligaments, or osseous processes, surrounding the articulation ; as in the articular processes of the vertebrae, the carpal joints, except that of the os magnum with the scaphoid and semilunar bones, and the tarsal joints with the exception of the joint between the astragalus and the navicular. On the next page, in a tabular form, are the names, distinctive characters, and examples of the different kinds of articulations. The Kinds of Movement admitted in Joints The movements admissible in joints may be divided into four kinds : gliding, angular movement, circumduction, and rotation. These movements are often, however, more or less combined in the various joints, so as to produce an infinite variety, and it is seldom that we find only one kind of motion in any particular joint.CLASSIFICATION OF JOINTS 291 Synarthrosis, or Immovable Joint.

Condyloid.—Ovoid head received into elliptical cavity. Movements in every direction except axial rotation. As the wrist-joint. Beciprocal Beception (Saddle-joint).—Articular surfaces inversely convex in one direction and concave in the other. Movement in every direction except axial rotation. As in the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb. Enarthrosis.—Ball-and-socket joint; capable of motion in all directions. Articulations by a globular head received into a cup-like cavity. As in hip- and shoulder-joints. Arthrodia.—Gliding joint; articulations by plane surfaces, which glide upon each other. As in carpal and tarsal articu- lations. u 2AETICULATIONS 292 Gliding movement is the most simple kind of motion that can take place in a joint, one surface gliding or moving over another without any angular or rotatory movement. It is common to all movable joints ; but in some, as in the articu- lations of the carpus and tarsus, it is the only motion permitted. This movement is not confined to plane surfaces, but may exist between any two contiguous surfaces, of whatever form, limited by the ligaments which enclose the articu- lation. Angular movement occurs only between the long bones, and by it the angle between the two bones is increased or diminished. It may take place in four directions : forwards and backwards, constituting flexion and extension, or inwards and outwards, from the mesial line of the body (or in the fingers and toes from the middle line of the hand or foot), constituting adduction and abduction. The strictly ginglymoid or hinge-joints admit of flexion and extension only. Abduction and adduction, combined with flexion and extension, are met with in the more movable joints ; as in the hip, shoulder, and metacarpal joint of the thumb, and partially in the wrist. Circumduction is that limited degree of motion which takes place between the head of a bone and its articular cavity, whilst the extremity and sides of the limb are made to circumscribe a conical space, the base of which corresponds with the mferior extremity of the limb, the apex with the articular cavity ; this kind of motion is best seen in the shoulder- and hip-joints. Rotation is the movement of a bone upon an axis, which is the axis of the pivot on which the bone turns, as in the articulation between the atlas and |axis, when the odontoid process serves as a pivot around which the atlas turns; or else is the axis of a pivot-like process which turns within a ring, as in the rotation of the radius upon the humerus. Ligamentous Action of Muscles.—The movements of the different joints of a limb are combined by means of the long muscles which pass over more than one joint, and which, when relaxed and stretched to their greatest extent, act to a certain extent as elastic ligaments in restraining certain movements of one joint, except when combined with corresponding movements of the other—these latter movements being usually in the opposite direction. Thus the shortness of the hamstring- muscles prevents complete flexion of the hip, unless the knee-joint be also flexed, so as to bring their attachments nearer together. The uses of this arrangement are threefold, i. It co-ordinates the kinds of movement which are the most habitual and necessary, and enables them to be performed with the least expendi- ture of power. ' Thus in the usual gesture of the arms, whether in grasping or rejecting, the shoulder and the elbow are flexed simultaneously, and simultaneously extended,' in consequence of the passage of the Biceps and Triceps cubiti over both joints. 2. It enables the short muscles which pass over only one joint to act upon more than one. ' Thus, if the Rectus femoris remain tonically of such length that, when stretched over the extended hip, it compels extension of the knee, then the Gluteus maximus becomes, not only an extensor of the hip, but an extensor of the knee as well.' 3. It provides the joints with ligaments which, while they are of very great power in resisting movements to an extent incompatible with the mechanism of the joint, at the same time spontaneously yield when necessary. ' Taxed beyond its strength a ligament will be ruptured, whereas a contracted muscle is easily relaxed ; also, if neighbouring joints be united by ligaments, the amount of flexion or extension of each must remain in constant proportion to that of the other ; while, if the union be by muscles, the separation of the points of attach- ment of those muscles may vary considerably in different varieties of movement, the muscles adapting themselves tonically to the length required.' The quotations are from a very interesting paper by Dr. Cleland, in the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' No. i, 1866, p. 85 ; by whom I believe this important fact in the mechanism of joints was first clearly pointed out, though it has been independently observed afterwards by other anatomists. Dr. W. W. Keen points out how important it is ' that the surgeon should remember this ligamentous action of293 OF THE SPINE muscles in making passive motion—for instance, at the wrist after Colles' fracture. If the fingers be extended, the wrist can be flexed to a right angle. If, however, they be first flexed as in " making a fist," flexion at the wrist is quickly limited to from forty to fifty degrees in different persons, and is very painful beyond that point. Hence passive motion here should be made with the fingers extended. In the leg, when flexing the hip, the knee should be flexed.' Dr. Keen further points out that ' a beautiful illustration of this is seen in the perching of birds, whose toes are forced to clasp the perch by just such a passive ligamentous action so soon as they stoop. Hence they can go to sleep and not fall off the perch.' The articulations may be arranged into those of the trunk, those of the upper extremity, and those of the lower extremity. ARTICULATIONS OF THE TRUNK These may be divided into the following groups, viz.:— I. Of the vertebral column. VII. Of the cartilages of the ribs with II. Of the atlas with the axis. the sternum, and with each other. III. Of the atlas with the occipital bone. VIII. Of the sternum. IV. Of the axis with the occipital bone. IX. Of the vertebral column with the V. Of the lower jaw. pelvis. VI. Of the ribs with the vertebrae. X. Of the pelvis. I. Articulations of the Veetebeal Column The different segments of the spine are connected together by ligaments, which admit of the same arrangement as the vertebrse. They may be divided into five sets. I. Those connecting the bodies of the vertebrae. 2. Those connecting the lamince. 3. Those connecting the articular processes. 4. Those connecting the spinous processes. 5. ^ho^Q oi iliQ transverse processes. The articulations of the bodies of the vertebras with each other form a series of amphiarthrodial joints; those between the articular processes form a series of arthrodial joints. I. The Ligaments of the Bodies Anterior Common Ligament. Posterior Common Ligament. Intervertebral Substance. The Anterior Common Ligament (figs. 227, 228, 235, 239) is a broad and strong band of ligamentous fibres, which extends along the front surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum. It is broader below than above, thicker in the dorsal than in the cervical or lumbar regions, and somewhat thicker opposite the front of the body of each vertebra, than opposite the inter- vertebral substance. It is attached, above, to the body of the axis by a pointed process, where it is continuous with the anterior atlanto-axial ligament, and is connected with the tendon of insertion of the Longus colli muscle, and extends down as far as the upper bone of the sacrum. It consists of dense longitudinal fibres, which are intimately adherent to the intervertebral substance, and the prominent margins of the vertebrae; but less closely to the middle of the bodies. In the latter situation the fibres are exceedingly thick, and serve to fill up the concavities on their front surface, and to make the anterior surface of the spine more even. This ligament is composed of several layers of fibres, which vary in length, but are closely interlaced with each other. The most superficial or longest fibres extend between four or five vertebra. A second subjacent set extend between two or three vertebrse ; whilst a third set, the shortest and deepest, extend from one vertebra to the next. At the side of the bodies, the ligament consists of a few short fibres, which pass from one vertebra to the next, separated from the median portion by large oval apertures, for the passage of vessels.294 ARTICULATIONS The Posterior Common Ligament (figs. 227, 231) is situated within the spinal canal, and extends along the xDOsterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the body of the axis above, where it is continuous with the occipito-axial ligament, to the sacrum below. It is broader above than below, and thicker in the dorsal than in the cervical or lumbar regions. In the situation of the intervertebral substance and contiguous margins of the vertebras, where the ligament is more intimately adherent, it is broad, and presents a series of dentations with inter- vening concave margins ; but it is narrow and thick over the centre of the bodies, from which it is separated by the vencz basis vertehrcB. This ligament is composed of smooth, shining, longitudinal fibres, denser and more compact than those of the anterior ligament, and composed of a superficial layer occupying the interval between three or four vertebrae, and of a deeper layer which extends between one vertebra and the next adjacent to it. It is separated from the dura mater of Fig. 227.—Vertical section of two vertebrae and their ligaments, from the lumbar region. Posterior the spinal cord by some loose connective tissue which is very liable to serous infiltration. The Intervertebral Substance (figs. 227, 236) is a lenticular disc of composite structure interposed between the adjacent surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum, and forming the chief bond of connection between those bones. These discs vary in shape, size, and thickness, in different parts of the spine. In shape they accurately correspond with the surfaces of the bodies between which they are placed, being oval in the cervical and lumbar regions, and cn^cular in the dorsal. Their size is greatest in the lumbar region. In thickness they vary not only in the different regions of the spine, but in different parts of the same disc : thus, they are much thicker in front than behind in the cervical and lumbar regions, while they are uniformly thick in the dorsal region. The intervertebral discs form about one-fourth of the spinal column, exclusive of the first two vertebrae ; they are not equally distributed, however, between the various bones; the dorsal portion of the spine having, in proportion to its length, a much smaller quantity than in the cervical and lumbar regions, which necessarily gives to the latter parts greater pliancy and freedom of movement. The intervertebral discs are adherent, by their surfaces, to a thin layer of hyahne cartilage whichOF THE SPINE 295 covers the upper and under surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae and in which the epiphysial plate develops; and by their circumference are closely connected in front to the anterior, and behind to the posterior common ligament; whilst in the dorsal region they are connected laterally, by means of the interarticular ligament, to the heads of those ribs which articulate with two vertebras; they, consequently, form part of the articular cavities in which the heads of these bones are received. Structure of the Intervertebral Substance.—The intervertebral substance is composed, at its circumference, of laminae of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage ; and, at its centre, of a soft, pulpy, highly elastic substance, of a yellowish colour, which rises up considerably above the surrounding level when the disc is divided horizontally. This pulpy substance, which is especially well developed in the lumbar region, is the remains of the chorda dorsalis, and, according to Luschka, contains a small synovial cavity in its centre. The laminae are arranged concen- trically one within the other, the outermost consisting of ordinary fibrous tissue, but the others and more numerous consisting of white fibro-cartilage. These plates are not quite vertical in their direction, those near the circumference being- curved outwards and closely approximated; whilst those nearest the centre curve in the opposite direction, and are somewhat more widely separated. The fibres of which each plate is composed are directed, for the most part, obliquely from above downwards ; the fibres of adjacent plates passing in opposite directions and varying in every layer; so that the fibres of one layer are directed across those of another, like the limbs of the letter X. This laminar arrangement belongs to about the outer half of each disc. The pulpy substance presents no concentric arrangement, and consists of a fine fibrous matrix, containing angular cells, united to form a reticular structure. 2. Ligaments connecting the LAMiNiE Ligamenta Subflava. The Ligamenta Subflava (fig. 227) are interposed between the laminfe of the vertebrae, from the axis to the sacrum. They are most distinct when seen from the interior of the spinal canal; when viewed from the outer surface, they appear short, being overlapped by the laminae. Each ligament consists of two lateral portions, which commence on each side at the root of either articular process, and pass backwards to the point where the laminae converge to form the spinous process, where their margins are in contact and to a certain extent united; slight intervals being left for the passage of small vessels. These ligaments consist of yellow elastic tissue, the fibres of which, almost perpendicular in direction, are attached to the anterior surface of the lamina above, some distance from its inferior margin, and to the posterior surface, as well as to the margin of the lamina below. In the cervical region they are thin in texture, but very broad and long; they become thicker in the dorsal region; and in the lumbar acquire very considerable thickness. Their highly elastic property serves to preserve the upright posture, and to assist in resuming it, after the spine has been flexed. These ligaments do not exist between the occiput and atlas, or between the atlas and axis. 3. Ligaments connecting the Articular Processes Capsular. The Capsular Ligaments (fig. 229) are thin and loose ligamentous sacs, attached to the contiguous margins of the articulating processes of each vertebra, through the greater part of their circumference, and completed internally by the ligamenta subflava. They are longer and looser in the cervical than in the dorsal or lumbar regions. The capsular ligaments are lined on their inner surface by synovial membrane.ARTICULATIONS 296 4. Ligaments connecting the Spinous Peocesses Supraspinous. Interspinous. The Supraspinous Ligament (fig. 227) is a strong fibrous cord, which connects together the apices of the spinous processes from the seventh cervical to the spinous processes of the sacrum. It is thicker and broader in the lumbar than in the dorsal region, and intimately blended, in both situations, with the neighbouring aponeu- rosis. The most superficial fibres of this ligament connect three or four vertebrae ; those deeper-seated pass between two or three vertebrae ; whilst the deepest connect the contiguous extremities of neighbouring vertebrae. It is continued upwards to the external occipital protuberance, as the ligamentum nuchae, which, in the human subject, is thin, and forms merely an intermuscular septum. The Interspinous Ligaments (fig. 227), thin and membranous, are interposed between the spinous processes. Each ligament extends from the root to the summit of each spinous process, and connects together their adjacent margins. They are narrow and elongated in the dorsal region ; broader, quadrilateral in form, and thicker m the lumbar region ; and only slightly developed in the neck. 5. Ligaments connecting the Transveese Peocesses Intertransverse. The Intertransverse Ligaments consist of bundles of fibres, interposed between the transverse processes. In the cervical region they consist of a few irregular, scattered fibres ; in the dorsal, they are rounded cords intimately con- nected with the deep muscles of the back ; in the lumbar region they are thin and membranous. Actions.—The movements permitted in the spinal column are. Flexion, Exten- sion, Lateral Movement, Circumduction, and Rotation. In Flexion, or movement of the spine forwards, the anterior common ligament is relaxed, and the intervertebral substances are compressed in front ; while the posterior common ligament, the ligamenta subflava, and the inter- and supra- spinous ligaments are stretched, as well as the posterior fibres of the intervertebral discs. The interspaces between the laminae are widened, and the inferior articular processes of the vertebrae above glide upwards, upon the articular processes of the vertebrae below. Flexion is the most extensive of all the movements of the spine. In Extension, or movement of the spine backwards, an exactly opposite dis- position of the parts takes place. This movement is not extensive, being limited by the anterior common ligament, and by the approximation of the spinous processes. Flexion and extension are most free in the lower part of the lumbar region between the third and fourth and fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra ; above the third they are much diminished, and reach their minimum in the middle and upper part of the back. They increase again in the neck, the capability of motion backwards from the upright position being in this region greater than that of the motion forwards, whereas in the lumbar region the reverse is the case. In Lateral Movement, the sides of the intervertebral discs are compressed, the extent of motion being limited by the resistance offered by the surrounding liga- ments, and by the approximation of the transverse processes. This movement may take place in any part of the spine, but is most free in the neck and loins. Circumduction is very limited, and is produced merely by a succession of the preceding movements. Rotation is produced by the twisting of the intervertebral substances ; this, although only slight between any two vertebrae, produces a great extent of move- ment, when it takes place in the whole length of the spine, the front of the297 OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS column being turned to one or the other side. This movement takes place only to a slight extent in the neck, but is freer in the upper part of the dorsal region, and is altogether absent in the lumbar region. It is thus seen that the cervical region enjoys the greatest extent of each variety of movement, flexion and extension especially being very free. In the dorsal region, the three movements of flexion, extension, and circumduction are only permitted to a slight extent; while rotation is very free in the upper part and ceases below. In the lumbar region there is free flexion, extension, and lateral movement, but no rotation. As Sir George Humphry has pointed out, the movements permitted are mainly due to the shape and position of the articulating processes. In the loins the inferior articulating processes are turned outwards and embraced by the superior; this renders rotation in this region of the spine impossible, while there is nothing to prevent a sliding upwards and downwards of the surfaces on each other so as to allow of flexion and extension. In the dorsal region, on the other hand, the articulating processes, by their direction and mutual adaptation, especially at the upper part of the series, permit of rotation, but prevent extension and flexion ; while in the cervical region the greater obliquity and lateral slant of the articular processes allow not only flexion and extension, but also rotation. The principal muscles which produce flexion are the Sterno-mastoid, Rectus capitis anticus major, and Longus colli; the Scaleni; the abdominal muscles and the Psoas magnus. Extension is produced by the fourth layer of the muscles of the back, assisted in the neck by the Splenius, Semispinalis dorsi et colli, and the Multifidus spinse. Lateral motion is produced by the fourth layer of the muscles of the back, by the Splenius and the Scaleni, the muscles of one side only acting ; and rotation by the action of the following muscles of one side only, viz. the Sterno-mastoid, the Eectus capitis anticus major, the Scaleni, the Multifidus spinae, the Complexus, and the abdominal muscles. The articulation of the Atlas with the Axis is of a complicated nature, comprising no fewer than four distinct joints. There is a pivot articulation between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed between the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament (see fig. 230). Here there are two joints : one in front between the posterior surface of the anterior arch of the atlas and the front of the odontoid process (the atlo-odontoid joint of Cruveilliier) ; the other between the anterior surface of the transverse ligament and the back of the process (the syndesmo-odontoid joint). Between the articulating processes of the two bones there is a double arthrodia or gliding joint. The ligaments which connect these bones are the Of the Two Anterior Atlanto-axial Ligaments (fig. 228), the more superficial is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line ; it is attached, above, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas ; below, to the base of the odontoid process and to the front of the body of the axis. The deeper ligament is a membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas; below, to the base of the odontoid process, and front of the body of the axis. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Recti antici majores. The Posterior Atlanto-axial Ligament (fig. 229) is a broad and thin membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the posterior arch of the atlas ; below, to the upper edge of the laminas of the axis. This ligament supplies the place of the ligamenta subflava, and is in relation, behind, with the Inferior oblique muscles. II. Aeticulation of the Atlas with the Axis Two Anterior Atlanto-axial. Posterior Atlanto-axial. Transverse. Two Capsular.ARTICULATIONS 298 The Transverse Ligament* (figs. 230, 231) is a thick and strong ligamentous band, which arches across the ring of the atlas, and serves to retain the odontoid process in firm connection with its anterior arch. This ligament is flattened from before backwards, broader and thicker in the middle than at either extremity, and firmly attached on each side to a small tubercle on the inner surface of the lateral mass of the atlas. As it crosses the odontoid process, a small fasciculus is derived from its upper and lower borders ; the former passing upwards, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone; the latter, downwards, to be attached to the posterior surface of the body of the axis ; hence, the whole ligament has received the name of cruciform. The transverse ligament divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal parts: of these, the posterior and larger serves for the transmission of the cord and its membranes and the spinal accessory nerves; the anterior and smaller contains the odontoid process. Since the space between the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament is smaller at the lower Fig. 238.—Occipito-atloid and atlo-axoid ligaments. Front view. part than the upper (because the transverse ligament embraces firmly the narrow neck of the odontoid process), this process is retained in firm connection with the atlas after all the other ligaments have been divided. The Capsular Ligaments are two thin and loose capsules, connecting the articular processes of the atlas and axis, the fibres being strongest on the anterior and external part of the articulation. There are four Synovial Membranes in this articulation : one lining the inner surface of each of the capsular ligaments ; one between the anterior surface of the odontoid process and the anterior arch of the atlas, the atlo-oclontoid joint; and one between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and the transverse ligament, the syndesmo-odontoid joint. The latter often communicates with those between the condyles of the occipital bone and the articular surfaces of the atlas. * It has been found necessary to describe the transverse ligament with those of the atlas and axis ; but the student must remember that it is really a portion of the mechanism by which the movements of the head on the spine are regulated; so that the connections between the atlas and axis ought always to be studied together with those between the latter bones and the skull.299 OF THE ATLAS WITH THE OCCIPITAL BONE Actions.—This joint allows the rotation of the atlas (and, with it, of the cranium) upon the axis, the extent of rotation being limited by the odontoid ligaments. The principal muscles by which this action is produced are the Sterno- mastoid and Complexus of one side, acting with the Eectus capitis anticus major, Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, Rectus capitis posticus major, and Inferior oblique of the other side. Articulations of the Spine with the Cranium The ligaments connecting the spine with the cranium may be divided into two sets, those connecting the occipital bone with the atlas, and those connecting the occipital bone with the axis. III. Articulation of the Atlas with the Occipital Bone This articulation is a double condyloid joint. Its ligaments are, the Two Anterior Occipito-atlantal. Two Lateral Occipito-atlantal. Posterior Occipito-atlantal. Two Capsular. Of the Two Anterior Occipito-atlantal Ligaments (fig. 228), the superficial is a strong, narrow, rounded cord, attached, above, to the basilar process of the Fig. 229.—Occipito-atloid and atlo-axoid ligaments. Posterior view. occiput; below, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas : the deeper hgament is a broad and thin membranous layer which passes between the anterior margin of the foramen magnum above, and the whole length of the upper border of the anterior arch of the atlas below. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the Recti antici minores ; behind, with the odontoid ligaments. The Posterior Occipito-atlantal Ligament (fig. 229) is a very broad but thin membranous lamina, intimately blended with the dura mater. It is connected, above, to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum ; below, to the upper border of the posterior arch of the atlas. This ligament is incomplete at each side, andARTICULATIONS 300 forms, with the superior intervertebral notch, an opening for the passage of the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the Recti postici minores and Obliqui superiores ; in front, with the dura mater of the spinal canal, to which it is intimately adherent. The Lateral Ligaments are strong fibrous bands, directed obliquely upwards and inwards, attached above to the jugular process of the occipital bone; below, to the base of the transverse process of the atlas. The Capsular Ligaments surround the condyles of the occipital bone, and connect them with the articular processes of the atlas; they consist of thin and loose capsules, which enclose the synovial membrane of the articulation. Synovial Membranes.—There are two synovial membranes in this articulation : one lining the inner surface of each of the capsular ligaments. These occasionally communicate with that between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. Actions.—The movements permitted in this joint are flexion and extension, which give rise to the ordinary forward and backward nodding of the head, besides Fig. 230.—Articulation between odontoid process and atlas. slight lateral motion to one or the other side. When either of these actions is carried beyond a slight extent, the whole of the cervical portion of the spine assists in its production. Flexion is mainly produced by the action of the Rectus capitis anticus major et minor and the Sterno-mastoid muscles; extension by the Rectus capitis posticus major et minor, the Superior oblique, the Complexus, Splenius, and upper fibres of the Trapezius. The Recti laterales are concerned in the lateral movement, assisted by the Trapezius, Splenius, Complexus, Sterno- mastoid and the Recti laterales of the same side, all acting together. According to Cruveilhier, there is a slight motion of rotation in this joint. IV. Aeticulation of the Axis with the Occipital Bone Occipito-axial. Three Odontoid. To expose these ligaments, the spinal canal should be laid open by removing the posterior arch of the atlas, the laminae and spinous process of the axis, and the portion of the occipital bone behind the foramen magnum, as seen in fig. 231. The Occipito-axial Ligament {aij]_mratus ligamentosus colli) is situated within the spinal canal. It is a broad and strong ligamentous band, which covers the odontoid process and its ligaments, and appears to be a prolongation upwards of the posterior common ligament of the spine. It is attached, below, to the posterior surface of the body of the axis, and, becoming expanded as it ascends, is inserted into the basilar groove of the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum, where it becomes blended with the dura mater of the skull. Relations.—By its anterior surface with the transverse ligament, by its posterior surface with the dura mater.TEMPOEO-MAXILLARY The Odontoid or Check Ligaments {alar ligaments) are strong, rounded, fibrous cords, which arise one on either side of the upper part of the odontoid process, and, passing obliquely upwards and outwards, are inserted into the rough depres sions on the inner side of the condyles of the occipital bone. In the triangular interval left between these ligaments and the margin of the foramen magnum, a strong fibro-cartilaginous cord {ligamentum suspensorium) may be seen, w^hich passes almost perpendicularly from the apex of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen, being intimately blended with the deep portion of the anterior occipito-atloid ligament, and upper fasciculus of the transverse ligament of the atlas. Actions.—The odontoid ligaments serve to limit the extent to which rotation of the cranium may be carried ; hence they have received the name of check ligaments. Fig. 231.—Occipito-axoid and atlo-axoid ligaments. Posterior view, obtained by removing the arches of the vertebrae and the posterior part of the skall. In addition to these ligaments which connect the atlas and axis to the skull, the ligament am nuchge must be regarded as one of the ligaments by which the spine is connected with the cranium. It is described on a subsequent page. Surgical Anatomy.—The ligaments which unite the component parts of the vertebras together are so strong, and these bones are so interlocked by the arrangement of their articulating processes, that dislocation is very uncommon, and, indeed, unless accompanied by fracture, rarely occurs, except in the upper part of the neck. Dislocation of the occiput from the atlas has only been recorded in one or two cases; but dislocation of the atlas from the axis, with rupture of the transverse ligament, is much more common : it is the mode in which death is produced in many cases of execution by hanging. In the lower part of the neck—that is, below the third cervical vertebra—dislocation unattended by fracture occasionally takes place. V. Tempoeo-maxillaky Articulation This is a double or bilateral condyloid joint; the parts entering into its formation on each side are, above, the anterior part of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone and the eminentia articularis; and, below, the condyle of the lower jaw. The ligaments are the following : —302 AETICULATIONS External Lateral. Stylo-maxillary. Internal Lateral. Capsular. Interarticular Fibro-cartilage. The External Lateral Ligament (fig. 232) is a short, thin, and narrow fasciculus attached, above, to the outer surface of the zygoma and to the rough Fig, 232.—Temp or 0-maxillary articulation. External view. tubercle on its lower border the neck of the lower jaw. Fig. 233. -Temporo -maxillary articulation. Internal view. below, to the outer surface and posterior border of It is broader above than below ; its fibres are placed parallel with one another, and directed obliquely downwards and backwards. Externally, it is covered by the parotid gland, and by the integument. In- ternally, it is in relation with the capsular ligament of which it is an accessory band, and not separable from it. The Internal Lateral Liga- ment (fig. 233) is a specialised band of cervical fascia which is attached above to the spinous ]3rocess of the sphenoid bone, and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the lingula and margin of the dental foramen. Its outer surface is in relation, above, with the External pterygoid muscle ; lower down, it is separated from the neck of the condyle by the internal maxillary artery ; and still more inferiorly, the inferior dental vessels and nerve separate it from the ramus of the jaw. The inner surface is in relation with the Internal pterygoid.TEMPORO-MAXILLARY The Stylo-maxillary Ligament is also a specialised band of the cervical fascia, which extends from near the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw, between the Masseter and Internal pterygoid muscles. This ligament separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and has attached to its inner side part of the fibres of origin of the Stylo-giossus muscle. Although usually classed among the ligaments of the jaw, it can only be considered as an accessory in the articulation. The Capsular Ligament forms a thin and loose ligamentous capsule, attached above to the circumference of the glenoid cavity and the articular surface im- mediately in front ; below, to the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw. It consists of a few thin scattered fibres, and can hardly be considered as a distinct ligament; it is thickest at the back part of the articulation.* The Interarticular Fibro-cartilage (fig. 234) is a thin plate of an oval form, placed horizontally between the condyle of the jaw and the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface is concavo-convex from before backwards, and a little convex transversely, to accommo- date itself to the form of the glenoid cavity. Its under surface, where it is in contact with the condyle, is concave. Its circumference is con- nected to the capsular ligament ; and in front to the tendon of the External pterygoid muscle. It is thicker at its circumference, espe- cially behind, than at its centre. The fibres of which it is composed have a concentric arrangement, more apparent at the circumference than at the centre. Its surfaces are smooth. It divides the joint into two cavities, each of which is furnished with a separate synovial membrane. The Synovial Membranes, two in number, are placed one above, and the other below, the fibro-cartilage. The upper one, the larger and looser of the two, is continued from the margin of the cartilage covering the glenoid cavity and eminentia articularis on to the upper surface of the fibro-cartilage. The lower one passes from the under surface of the fibro-cartilage to the neck of the condyle of the jaw, being prolonged downwards a little further behind than in front. The nerves of this joint are derived from the auriculo-temporal and masseteric branches of the inferior maxillary. The arteries are derived from the temporal branch of the external carotid. Actions.—The movements permitted in this articulation are very extensive. Thus, the jaw may be depressed or elevated, or it may be carried forwards or backwards, or from side to side. It is by the alternation of these movements, performed in succession, that a kind of rotatory motion of the lower jaw upon the upper takes place, which materially assists in the mastication of the food. If the movement of depression is carried only to a slight extent, the condyles remain in the glenoid cavities, rotating on a transverse axis against the inter- articular fibro-cartilage ; but if the depression is considerable, the condyles glide from the glenoid fossae on to the articular eminences, carrying with them the inter- articular fibro-cartilages, so that in opening the mouth widely the two movements are combined—i.e. the condyle rotates on a transverse axis against the fibro- cartilage, and at the same time glides forwards, carrying the fibro-cartilage with it. When the jaw is elevated, after forced depression, the condyles and fibro-cartilages * Sir G. Humphry describes the internal portion of the capsular ligament separately, as the short internal lateral ligament; and it certainly seems as deserving of a separate description as the external lateral ligament is. Fig. 234.—A^ertical section of temporo- maxillary articulation..ARTICULATIONS return to their original position. When the jaw is carried horizontally forwards and backwards, or from side to side, a horizontal gliding movement of the fibro- cartilages and condyles upon the glenoid cavities takes place in the corresponding direction. The lower jaw is depressed by its own weight, assisted by the Platysma, the Digastric, the Mylo-hyoid, and the Genio-hyoid. It is elevated by the anterior part of the Temporal, Masseter, and Internal pterygoid. It is drawn fonvards by the simultaneous action of the External pterygoid, and the superficial fibres of the Masseter; and it is drawn backwards by the deep fibres of the Masseter and the posterior fibres of the Temporal muscle. The grinding movement is caused by the alternate action of the two External pterygoids. Surface Form.—The temporo-maxillary articulation io quite superficial, situated below the base of the zygoma, in front of the tragus and external auditory meatus, and behind the posterior border of the upper part of the Masseter muscle. Its exact position can be at once ascertained by feeling for the condyle of the jaw, the working of which can be distinctly felt in the movements of the lower jaw either vertically or from side to side. When the mouth is opened wide, the condyle advances out of the glenoid fossa on to the eminentia articularis and a depression is felt in the situation of the joint. Surgical Anatomy.—The lower jaw is dislocated only in one direction—viz. forwards. The accident is caused by violence or muscular action. When the mouth is open, the condyle is situated on the eminentia articularis, and any sudden violence, or even a sudden muscular spasm as during a convulsive yawn, may displace the condyle forwards into the zygomatic fossa. The displacement may be unilateral or bilateral, according as one or both of the condyles are displaced. The latter of the two is the more common. Sir Astley Cooper described a condition which he termed ' subluxation.' It occurs principally in delicate women, and is believed by some to be due to relaxation of the ligaments, permitting too free movement of the bone, and possibly some displacement of the tibro- cartilage. Others have believed that it is due to gouty or rheumatic changes in the joint. In close relation to the condyle of the jaw is the external auditory meatus and the tym- panum; any force, therefore, applied to the bone is liable to be attended with damage to these parts, or inflammation in the joint may extend to the ear, or on the other hand inflammation of the middle ear may involve the articulation and cause its destruction, thus leading to ankylosis of the joint. In children, arthritis of this joint may also follow the exanthemata, and in adults occurs as the result of some constitutional conditions, as rheu- matism or gout. The temporo-maxillary joint is also frequently the seat of osteo-arthritis, leading to great suffering during efforts of mastication. A peculiar affection sometimes attacks the neck and condyle of the lower jaw, consisting in hypertrophy and elonoation of these parts and consequent protrusion of the chin to the opposite side. VI. Articulations OF the Ribs with the Vertebra The articulations of the ribs with the vertebral column may be divided into two sets : I. Those which connect the heads of the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae. 2. Those which connect the necks and tubercles of the ribs with the transverse processes. I. Articulations between the Heads of the Ribs and the Bodies OF the Vertebra (fig. 235) These constitute a series of arthrodial joints, formed by the articulation of the heads of the ribs with the cavities on the contiguous margins of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, connected together by the following ligaments :— Anterior Costo-vertebral or Stellate. Capsular. Interarticular. The Anterior Costo-vertebral or Stellate Lig^ament connects the anterior part of the head of each rib with the sides of the bodies of two vertebrae, and the inter- vertebral disc between them. It consists of three fiat bundles of ligamentous fibres, which radiate from the anterior part of the head of the rib. The superior fasciculus passes upwards to be connected with the body of the vertebra above ; the inferior one descends to the body of the vertebra below; and the middle one, the smallest and least distinct, passes horizontally inwards, to be attached to the intervertebral substance.OF THE RIBS WITH TRANSVERSE PROCESSES 305 ligament Belations.—ln front, with the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, the plem^a, and, on the right side, with the vena azygos major ; behind, with the interarticular ligament and synovial membranes. In the first rib, which articulates with a single vertebra only, this does not present a distinct division into three fascicuh ; its fibres, however, radiate, and are attached to the body of the last cervical vertebra, as well as to the body of the vertebra with which the rib articulates. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs also, which hkewise articulate with a single vertebra, the division does not exist; but the fibres of the hgament in each case radiate and are connected with the vertebra above, as well as that with which the ribs articulate. The Capsular Ligament is a thin and loose ligamentous bag, which surrounds the joint between the head of the rib and the articular cavity formed by the intervertebral disc and the adjacent vertebrae. Fig. 235.—Costo-vertebral and costo-transverse articulations. It is very thin, firmly Anterior view, connected with the an- terior ligament, and most distinct at the upper and lower parts of the articulation. Be- hind, some of its fibres pass through the inter- vertebral foramen to the back of the interverte- bral disc. This is the analogue of the liga- mentum conjugale of some mammals, which unites the heads of oppo- site ribs across the back of the intervertebral disc. The Interarticular Ligament is situated in the interior of the joint. It consists of a short band of fibres, flattened from above downwards, attached by one extremity to the sharp crest on the head of the rib, and by the other to the intervertebral disc. It divides the joint into two cavities, which have no communication with each other. In the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, the interarticular ligament does not exist; consequently, there is but one synovial membrane. The Synovial Membrane.—There are two synovial membranes in each of the articulations in which there is an interarticular ligament, one on each side of this structure. cavity Interarticular ligament Lower synovial cavity 2. Articulations of the Necks and Tubercles of the Ribs with THE Transverse Processes (fig. 236) The articular portion of the tubej'cle of the rib and adjacent transverse process form an arthrodial joint. In the eleventh and huelftli ribs this articulation is wanting. The ligaments connecting these parts are the—■ Anterior Costo-transverse. Middle Costo-transverse (Interosseous). Posterior Costo-transverse. Capsular. XARTICULATIONS 3o6 The Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament [superior or long) consists of two sets of fibres : the one is attached below to the sharp crest on the upper border of the neck of each rib, and passing obhquely upwards and outwards, to the lower border of the transverse ]3rocess immediately above ; the other is attached below to the neck of the rib, and passes upwards and inwards to the base of the transverse process and border of the lower articular process of the vertebra above. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the intercostal vessels and nerves; behind, with the Longissimus dorsi. Its internal border completes an aperture formed between it and the articular processes, through which pass the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves. Its external border is continuous with a thin aponeurosis, which covers the External intercostal muscle. The first rib has no anterior costo-transverse hgament. The Middle Costo-transverse or Interosseous Ligament consists of short but strong fibres, which pass between the rough surface on the posterior part of the neck of each rib and the anterior surface of the adjacent transverse process. In Fig. 236.—Costo-transverse articulation. Seen from above. order fully to expose this ligament, a horizontal section should be made across the transverse process and corresponding part of the rib ; or the rib may be forcibly separated from the transverse process, and its fibres put on the stretch. In the eleventh and tioelfth ribs this ligament is quite rudimentary or wanting. The Posterior Costo-transverse Ligament is a short but thick and strong fasciculus, which passes obliquely from the summit of the transverse process to the rough non-articular portion of the tubercle of the rib. This ligament is shorter and more oblique in the upper than in the lower ribs. Those corresponding to the superior ribs ascend, while those of the inferior ribs descend slightly. In the eleventh and tioelfth ribs this ligament is wanting. The Capsular Ligament is a thin, membranous sac attached to the circum- ference of the articular surfaces, and enclosing a small synovial membrane. In the eleve7ith and tioelfth ribs this ligament is absent. Actions.—The heads of the ribs are so closely connected to the bodies of the verte- brae by the stellate and interarticular ligaments, and the necks and tubercles of the ribs to the transverse processes, that only a shght ghding movement of the articular surfaces on each other can take place in these articulations. The result of this gliding movement is an elevation of the front and middle portion of the rib, theMOVEMENT OF THE RIBS ON THE VERTEBR.^ hinder part being prevented from performing any upward movement by its close connection with the spine. In this gliding movement there are two axes of rotation— that is to say, the rib rotates on an axis corresponding with a Une drawn through the two articulations, Costo-vertebral and Costo-transverse, which the rib forms with the spine ; and secondly, it rotates on an axis corresponding with a line drawn from the head of the rib to the sternum. By the first movement—that of rotation of the rib on an axis corresponding with a line drawn through the two articulations which this bone forms with the spine—an elevation of the anterior part of the rib takes place, and a consequent enlargement of the antero-posterior diameter of the chest. None of the ribs lie in a truly horizontal plane : Fig. 237.—Diagrams showing the axis of rotation of they are all directed more or less obliquely, so that their anterior extremities lie on a lower level than their posterior, and this obliquity increases from the first to the seventh, and then again decreases. If we examine any one rib—say, that in which there is the greatest obliquity—we shall see that it is obvious that as its sternal extremity is carried upwards, it must also be thrown forwards ; so that the rib may be regarded as a radius, moving on the verte- bral joint as a centre, and causing the sternal attachment to describe an arc of a circle in the vertical plane of the body. Since all the ribs are oblique and connected in front to the sternum by the elastic costal cartilages, they must have a tendency to thrust the sternum forwards, and so increase the antero-posterior diameter of the chest. By the second movement—that of the rotation of the rib on an axis corresponding with a line drawn from the head of the rib to the sternum—-an elevation of the middle portion of the rib takes place, and consequently an increase in the transverse diameter of the chest. For the ribs not only slant downwards and forwards from their vertebral attachment, but they are also oblique in relation to their transverse plane—that is to say, their middle is on a lower level than either their vertebral or sternal extremities. It results from this that when the ribs are raised, the centre portion is thrust outwards, somewhat after the fashion in which the handle of a bucket is thrust away from the side when raised to a horizontal position, and the lateral diameter of the chest is increased (see fig- 237). The mobility of the different ribs varies very much. The first rib is more fixed than the others, on account of the weight of the upper extremity and the strain of the ribs beneath; but on the freshly dissected thorax it moves as X 2 the ribs m the movements of respiration. The one axis of rotation corresponds with a line drawn through the two articulations which the rib forms with the spine (a, b), and the other with a line drawn from the head of the rib to the sternum (A, b). (From Kirke's ' Handbook of Physiology.')3o8 ARTICULATIONS freely as the others. From the same causes the movement of the second rih is also not very extensive. In the other ribs, this mobility increases successively down to the last two, which are very movable. The ribs are generally more movable in the female than in the male. VII. Articulation of the Cartilages of the Ribs with the Sternum, etc. (fig. 238) The articulations of the cartilages of the true ribs with the sternum are arthro- dial joints, with the exception of the first, in which the cartilage is almost always directly united with the sternum, and which must, therefore, be regarded as a synarthrodial articulation. The ligaments connecting them are— Anterior Chondrb-sternal. Interarticular Chondro-sternal. Posterior Chondro-sternal. Anterior Chondro-xiphoid. Capsular. Posterior Chondro-xiphoid. The Anterior Chondro-sternal Ligament is a broad and thin membranous band that radiates from the front of the inner extremity of the cartilages of the true ribs to the anterior surface of the sternum. It is composed of fasciculi which pass in different directions. The superior fasciculi ascend obliquely, the inferior pass obliquely downwards, and the middle fasciculi horizontally. The superficial fibres of this ligament are the longest; they intermingle with the fibres of the ligaments above and below them, with those of the opposite side, and Avith the tendinous fibres of origin of the Pectoralis major, forming a thick fibrous membrane, Avhich covers the surface of the sternum. This is more distinct at the lower than at the upper part. The Posterior Chondro-sternal Ligament, less thick and distinct than the anterior, is composed of fibres which radiate from the posterior surface of the sternal end of the cartilages of the true ribs to the posterior surface of the sternum, becoming blended with the periosteum. The Capsular Ligament surrounds the joints formed between the cartilages of the true ribs and the sternum. It is very thin, intimately blended with the anterior and posterior ligaments, and strengthened at the upper and lower part of the articulation by a few fibres, which pass from the cartilage to the side of the sternum. These ligaments protect the synovial membranes. The Interarticular Chondro-sternal Ligaments.—These are only found between the second and third costal cartilages and the sternum. The cartilage of the second rih is connected with the sternum by means of an interarticular ligament, attached by one extremity to the cartilage of the second rib, and by the other extremity to the cartilage which unites the first and second pieces of the sternum. This articulation is provided with two synovial membranes. The cartilage of the third rib is connected with the sternum by means of an interarticular ligament which is attached by one extremity to the cartilage of the third rib, and by the ^ other extremity to the point of junction of the second and third pieces of the sternum. This articulation is provided with two synovial membranes. The Anterior Chondro-xiphoid.—This is a band of ligamentous fibres, which connects the anterior surface of the seventh costal cartilage, and occasionally also that of the sixth, to the anterior surface of the ensiform appendix. It varies in length and breadth in different subjects. The Posterior Chondro-xiphoid is a similar band of fibres on the internal or posterior surface, though less thick and distinct. Synovial Membranes.—There is no synovial membrane between the first costal cartilage and the sternum, as this cartilage is directly continuous with the sternum. There are two synovial membranes both in the articulation of the second and third costal cartilages to the sternum. There is generally one synovial membrane in each of the joints between the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages to theOF THE CAETILAGES OF THE RIBS sternum; but it is sometimes absent in the sixth and seventh chondro-sternal joints. Thus there are eight synovial cavities on each side in the articulations between the costal cartilages of the true ribs and the sternum. After middle life the articular surfaces lose their polish, become roughened, and the synovial Fig. 238.—Chondro-sternal, chondro-xiphoid, and interchondral articulations. Anterior view. The synovial cavities exposed hy a vertical section of the sternum and cartilages membranes appear to be wanting. In old age, the articulations do not exist, the cartilages of most of the ribs becoming continuous with the sternum. Actions.—The movements which are permitted in the chondro-sternal articu- lations are limited to elevation and depression, and these only to a slight extent.AETICULATIOXS Aeticulatioxs of the Cartilages of the Ribs with each other (Ixteechondeal) (fig. 238) The contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate with each other by small, smooth, oblong-shaped facets. Each articulation is enclosed in a thin capsnlar ligament lined by synovial membrane, and strengthened externally and internally by liga- mentous fibres (interchondral ligaments), which pass from one cartilage to the other. Sometimes the fifth costal cartilage, more rarely that of the ninth, articu- lates, by its lower border, with the adjoining cartilage by a small oval facet; more frequently they are connected together by a few ligamentous fibres. Occasionally, the articular surfaces above mentioned are wanting. Aeticulatioxs of the Ribs with theie Caetilages (Costo-choxdeal) (fig. 238) The outer extremity of each costal cartilage is received into a depression in the sternal end of the ribs, and the two are held together by the periosteum. YIII. LiGAMEXTS OF THE StEEXUM The first piece of the sternum is united to the second either by an amphi- arthrodial joint—a single piece of true fibro-cartilage uniting the segments—or by a diarthrodial joint, in which each bone is clothed with a distinct lamina of cartilage, adherent on one side, free and lined with synovial membrane on the other. In the latter case, the cartilage covering the gladiolus is continued without interruption on to the cartilages of the second ribs. Mr. Rivington has found the diarthrodial form of joint in about one-third of the specimens examined by him, Mr. Maisonneuve more frequently. It appears to be rare in childhood, and is formed, in Mr. Rivington's opinion, from the amphiarthrodial form, by absorption. The diarthrodial joint seems to have no tendency to ossify at any age, while the amphiarthrodial is more liable to do so, and has been found ossified as early as thirty-four years of age. The two segments are further connected by an Anterior Inter sternal Ligament. Posterior Intersternal Ligament. The Anterior Intersternal Ligament consists of a layer of fibres, having a longitudinal direction ; it blends with the fibres of the anterior chondro-sternal ligaments on both sides, and with the tendinous fibres of origin of the Pectoralis major. This ligament is rough, irregular, and much thicker below than above. The Posterior Intersternal Ligament is disposed in a somewhat similar manner on the posterior surface of the articulation. IX. Aeticulatiox of the Pelvis with the Spixe The ligaments connecting the last lumbar vertebra with the sacrum are similar to those which connect the segments of the spine with each other—viz.: i. The continuation downwards of the anterior and posterior common ligaments. 2. The intervertebral substance connecting the flattened oval surfaces of the two bones and forming an amphiarthrodial joint. 3. Ligamenta subflava, connecting the arch of the last lumbar vertebra with the posterior border of the sacral canal. 4. Capsular ligaments connecting the articulating processes and forming a double arthrodia. 5. Inter- and supra-spinous ligaments. The two proper ligaments connecting the pelvis with the spine are the lumbo- sacral and ilio-lumbar. The Lumbo-sacral Ligament (fig. 239) is a short, thick, triangular fasciculus, which is connected above to the lower and front part of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, passes obliquely outwards, and is attached below toOF THE PELVIS the lateral surface of the base of the sacrum, becoming blended with the anterior sacro-iliac ligament. This ligament is in relation, in front, with.the Psoas muscle. The Ilio-lumbar Ligament (fig. 239) passes horizontally outwards from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium immediately in front of the sacro-iliac articulation. It is of a triangular form, thick and narrow internally, broad and thinner externally. It is in relation, in front, with the Psoas muscle; behind, with the muscles occupying the vertebral groove ; above, with the Quadratus lumborum. X. Articulations of the Pelvis The ligaments connecting the bones of the pelvis with each other may be divided into four groups : i. Those connecting the sacrum and ilium. 2. Those Fig. 239.—Articulations of pelvis and hip. Anterior view. passing between the sacrum and ischium. 3. Those connecting the sacrum and coccyx. 4. Those between the two pubic bones. I. Aeticulations of the Sacrum and Ilium The sacro-iliac articulation is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed between the lateral surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. The anterior or auricular portion of each articular surface is covered with a thin plate of cartilage, thicker on the sacrum than on the ilium. The surfaces of these cartilages in the adult are rough and irregular, and separated from one another by a soft, yellow, pulpy substance. At an early period of life, occasionally in the adult, and in the female during pregnancy, they are smooth, and lined by a delicate synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting these surfaces are the anterior and posterior sacro-iliac.312 ARTICULATIONS The Anterior Saero-iliac Ligament (fig. 239) consists of numerous thin ligamentous bands, which connect the anterior surfaces of the sacrum and ihum. The Posterior Saero-iliac (fig. 240) is a strong interosseous ligament, situated in a deep depression between the sacrum and ilium behind, and forming the chief bond of connection between those bones. It consists of numerous strong fasciculi, which pass between the bones in various directions. Three of these are of large size ; the Uoo superior, nearly horizontal in direction, arise from the first and second transverse tubercles on the posterior surface of the sacrum, and are inserted into the rough, uneven surface at the posterior part of the inner surface of the • ilium. The third fasciculus, oblique in direction, is attached by one extremity to the third transverse tubercle on the posterior surface of the sacrum, and by the Fig. 240.—Articulations of pelvis and hip. Posterior view. other to the posterior superior spine of the ilium; it is sometimes called the oblique saero-iliac ligaf}ient. The position of the saero-iliac joint is indicated by the posterior superior spine of the ilinm. This process is immediately behind the centre of the articulation. 2. Ligaments passing between the Saceum and Ischium (fig. 240) The Great Sacro-sciatic (Posterior). The Lesser Sacro-sciatic (Anterior). The Great or Posterior Sacro-sciatic Ligament is situated at the lower and back part of the pelvis. It is thin, flat, and triangular in form ; narrower in the middle than at the extremities; attached by its broad base to the posterior inferior spine of the ihum, to the fourth and fifth transverse tubercles of the sacrum, and to the lower part of the lateral margin of that bone and the coccyx. Passing obliquely downwards, outwards, and forwards, it becomes narrow and thick; and at its insertion into the inner margin of the tuberosity of the ischium, it increasesOF THE PELVIS 313 in breadth, and is prolonged forwards along the inner margin of the ramus, forming what is known as the falciform ligament. The free concave edge of this |)rolonga- tion has attached to it the obturator fascia, with which it forms a kind of groove, protecting the internal pudic vessels and nerve. One of its surfaces is turned towards the perinasum, the other towards the Obturator internus muscle. The posterior surface of this ligament gives origin, by its whole extent, to fibres of the Gluteus maximus. Its anterior surface is united to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. Its external border forms, above, the posterior boundary of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and, below, the lower boundary of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. Its loioer border forms part of the boundary of the perinaeum. It is pierced by the coccygeal branch of the sciatic artery and coccygeal nerve. The iesser or Anterior Sacro-sciatic Ligament, much shorter and smaller than the preceding, is thin, triangular in form, attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium, and internally, by its broad base, to the lateral margin of the sacrum and coccyx, anterior to the attachment of the great sacro-sciatic ligament with which its fibres are intermingled. It is in relation, anteriorly, with the Coccygeus muscle ; posteriorly, it is covered by the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and crossed by the internal pudic vessels and nerve. Its superior border forms the lower boundary of the great sacro-sciatic foramen ; its inferior border, part of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. These two ligaments convert the sacro-sciatic notches into foramina. The superior or great sacro-sciatic foramen is bounded, in front and above, by the posterior border of the os innominatum; behind, by the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and below, by the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. It is partially filled up, in the recent state, by the Pyriformis muscle which passes through it. Above this muscle, the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve emerge from the pelvis ; and below it, the sciatic vessels and nerves, the internal pudic vessels and nerve, and muscular branches from the sacral plexus. The inferior or lesser sacro-sciatic foramen is bounded, in front, by the tuber ischii; above, by the spine and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament; behind, by the greater sacro-sciatic ligament. It transmits the tendon of the Obturator internus muscle, its nerve, and the internal pudic vessels and nerve. 3. Articulation of the Sacrum and Coccyx This articulation is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed between the oval surface at the apex of the sacrum, and the base of the coccyx. It is analogous to the joints between the bodies of the vertebrae, and is connected by similar ligaments. They are the Anterior Sacro-coccygeah Lateral Sacro-coccygeal. Posterior Sacro-coccygeal. Interposed Fibro-cartilage. The Anterior Sacro-coccygeal Ligament consists of a few irregular fibres, which descend from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx, becoming blended with the periosteum. The Posterior Sacro-coccygeal Ligament is a flat band of ligamentous fibres, of a pearly tint, which arises from the margin of the lower orifice of the sacral canal, and descends to be inserted into the posterior surface of the coccyx. This ligament completes the lower and back part of the sacral canal. Its superficial fibres are much longer than the more deeply seated. This ligament is in relation, behind, with the Gluteus maximus. The Lateral Sacro-coccygeal Ligaments are ligamentous bands which pass from the cornua of the last sacral vertebra to the cornua of the first piece of the coccyx. A Fibro-cartilage is interposed between the contiguous surfaces of the sacrum and coccyx; it differs from that interposed between the bodies of the vertebra3 in being thinner, and its central part firmer in texture. It is somewhat thicker in front and behind than at the sides. Occasionally, a synovial membrane is foundARTICULATIONS 314 when the coccyx is freely movable, which is more especially the case during pregnancy. The different segments of the coccyx are connected together by an extension downwards of the anterior and posterior sacro-coccygeal hgaments, a thin annular disc of fibro-cartilage being interposed between each of the bones. In the adult male, all the pieces become ossified ; but in the female, this does not commonly occur until a later period of life. The separate segments of the coccyx are first united, and at a more advanced age the joint between the sacrum and coccyx is obliterated. Actions.—The movements which take place between the sacrum and coccyx, and between the different pieces of the latter bone, are slightly forwards and backwards ; they are very limited. Their extent increases during pregnancy. 4. Articulation of the Ossa Pubis (fig. 241) The articulation between the pubic bones is an amphiarthrodial joint, formed by the junction of the two oval articular surfaces of the ossa pubis. The articular surface has been described on a former page under the name of symphysis, and the same name is given to the joint. The ligaments of this articulation are the Anterior Pubic. Posterior Pubic. Superior Pubic. Subpubic. Interpubic Disc. The Anterior Pubic Ligament consists of several superimposed layers, which pass across the front of the articulation. The superficial fibres pass obliquely from one bone to the other, Ficx. 241.—Vertical section of the symphysis pubis, decussating and forming an in- terlacement with the fibres of the aponeurosis of the External oblique and the tendon of the Rectus muscles. The deep fibres pass transversely across the symphysis, and are blended with the fibro-cartilage. The Posterior Pubic Liga- ment consists of a few thin, scattered fibres, which unite the two pubic bones posteriorly. The Superior Pubic Liga- ment is a band of fibres, which connects together the two pubic bones superiorly. The Subpubic Ligament is a thick, triangular arch of liga- mentous fibres, connecting to- gether the two pubic bones below, and forming the upper boundary of the pubic arch. Above, it is blended with the interarticular fibro-cartilage; laterally, it is united with the rami of the OS pubis. Its fibres are closely connected, and have an arched direction. The Interpubic Disc consists of a disc of cartilage and fibro-cartilage- con- necting the surfaces of the pubic bones in front. Each pubic symphysis is covered by a thin layer of hyaline cartilage, which is firmly connected to the bone by a series of nipple-like processes which accurately fit within corresponding depres- sions on the osseous surfaces. These opposed cartilaginous surfaces are connected together by an intermediate stratum of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage which varies in thickness in different subjects. It often contains a cavity in its centre, l^robably formed by the softening and absorption of the fibro-cartilage, since it rarely appears before the tenth year of life, and is not lined by synovial membrane.STEENO-CLAVICULAR JOINT \ It is larger in the female than in the male, but it is very questionable whether lU enlarges, as was formerly supposed, during pregnancy. It is most frequently limited to the upper and back part of the joint; but it occasionally reaches to the front, and may extend the entire length of the cartilage. This cavity may be easily demonstrated by making a vertical section of the symphysis pubis near its posterior surface. The Obturator Ligament is more properly regarded as analogous to the muscular fasciae, with which it will be described. ARTICULATIONS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY The articulations of the Upper Extremity may be arranged in the following groups:—I. Sterno-clavicular articulation. 11. Acromio-clavicular articulation. III. Ligaments of the Scapula. IV. Shoulder-joint. V. Elbow-joint. VI. Radio-ulnar articulations. VII. Wrist-joint. VIII. Articulations of the Carpal Bones. IX. Carpo-metacarpal articulations. X. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. XL Articulations of the Phalanges. I. Stekno-clavicular Aeteculation (fig. 242) The Sterno-clavicular is regarded by most anatomists as an arthrodial joint; but Cruveilhier considers it to be an articulation by reciprocal reception. Probably Fig. 242.—Sterno-clavicular articulation. Anterior view. the former opinion is the correct one ; the varied movements, which the joint enjoys, being due to the interposition of an interarticular fibro-cartilage between the joint surfaces. The parts entering into its formation are the sternal end of the clavicle, the upper and lateral part of the first piece of the sternum, and the cartilage of the first rib. The articular surface of the clavicle is much larger than that of the sternum, and invested with a layer of cartilage,* which is considerably thicker than that on the latter bone. The ligaments of this joint are the Anterior Sterno-clavicular. Interclavicular. Posterior Sterno-clavicular. Costo-clavicular (rhomboid). Interarticular Fibro-cartilage. The Anterior Sterno-clavicular Ligament is a broad band of fibres, which covers the anterior surface of the articulation, being attached, above, to the upper * According to Bruch, the sternal end of the clavicle is covered by a tissue, which is rather fibrous than cartilaginous in structure.ARTICULATIONS and front x^art of the inner extremity of the clavicle ; and, passing obliquely downwards and inwards, is attached, below, to the up^oer and front part of the first piece of the sternum. This ligament is covered, in front, by the sternal portion of the Sterno-cleido-mastoid and the integument; behind, it is in relation with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and the two synovial membranes. The Posterior Sterno-clavicular Lig^ament is a similar band of fibres, which covers the posterior surface of the articulation, being attached, above, to the upper and back part of the inner extremity of the clavicle ; and, passing obliquely downwards and inwards, is attached, below, to the upper and back part of the first piece of the sternum. It is in relation, in front, with the interarticular fibro- cartilage and synovial membranes; behind, with the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno- thyroid muscles. The Interclavicular Ligament is a flattened band, which varies considerably in form and size in different individuals ; it passes in a curved direction from the upper part of the inner extremity of one clavicle to the other, and is closely attached to the upper margin of the sternum. It is in relation, in front, with the integument; behind, with the Sterno-thyroid muscles. The Costo-clavicular Ligament (rhomboid) is short, flat, and strong: it is of a rhomboid form, attached, below, to the upper and inner part of the cartilage of the first rib : it ascends obliquely backwards and outwards, and is attached, above, to the rhomboid depression on the under surface of the clavicle. It is in relation, in front, with the tendon of origin of the Subclavius; behind, with the subclavian vein. The Interarticular Fibro-cartilage is a flat and nearly circular disc, interposed between the articulating surfaces of the sternum and clavicle. It is attached, above, to the upper and posterior border of the articular surface of the clavicle; below, to the cartilage of the first rib, at its junction with the sternum ; and by its circumference to the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular and interclavicular Hgaments. It is thicker at the circumference, especially its upper and back part, than at its centre, or below. It divides the joint into two cavities, each of which is furnished with a separate synovial membrane. Of the two Synovial Membranes found in this articulation, one is reflected from the sternal end of the clavicle, over the adjacent surface of the fibro-cartilage, and cartilage of the first rib ; the other is placed between the articular surface of the sternum and adjacent surface of the fibro-cartilage ; the latter is the larger of the two. They seldom contain much synovia. Actions.—This articulation is the centre of the movements of the shoulder, and admits of a Hmited amount of motion in nearly every direction—upwards, down- wards, backwards, forwards, as well as circumduction. When these movements take place in the joint, the clavicle in its motion carries the scapula with itj this bone ghding on the outer surface of the chest. This joint therefore forms the centre from which all movements of the supporting arch of the shoulder originate, and is the only point of articulation of this part of the skeleton with the trunk. ' The movements attendant on elevation and depression of the shoulder take place between the clavicle and the interarticular fibro-cartilage, the bone rotating upon the Hgament on an axis drawn from before backwards through its own articular facet. When the shoulder is moved forwards and backwards, the clavicle, with the interarticular fibro-cartilage, rolls to and fro on the articular surface of the sternum, revolving, with a sliding movement, round an axis drawn nearly vertically through the sternum. In the circumduction of the shoulder, which is compounded of these two movements, the clavicle revolves upon the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and the latter, with the clavicle, rolls upon the sternum.' * Elevation of the clavicle is principally limited by the costo-clavicular ligament; depression, by the inter- clavicular. The muscles which raise the clavicle, as in shrugging the shoulders, are the upper fibres of the Trapezius, the Levator anguli scapula?, the clavicular Humphry, On the Human Skeletoti, p. 402.317 ACROMIO-CLAVICULAR JOINT head of the Sterno-mastoid, assisted to a certain extent by the two Rhomboids, which pull the inferior angle of the Scapula backwards and upwards and so raise the clavicle. The depression of the clavicle is principally effected by gravity, assisted by the Subclavius, Pectoralis minor, and lower fibres of the Trapezius. It is drawn hachivards by the Rhomboids and the middle and lower fibres of the Trapezius, and/orwarr/s by the Serratus magnus and Pectoralis minor. Surface Form.—The position of the sterno-clavicular joint may be easily ascertained by feeling the enlarged sternal end of the collar-bone just external to the long, cord-like, sternal origin of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. If this muscle is relaxed by bending the head forwards, a depression just internal to the end of the clavicle, and between it and the sternum, can be felt, indicating the exact position of the joint, which is subcutaneous. When the arm hangs by the side, the cavity of the joint is V-shaped. If the arm is raised, the bones become more closely approximated, and the cavity becomes a mere slit. Surgical Anatomy.—The strength of this joint mainly depends upon its ligaments, and it is to ithis, and to the fact that the force of the blow is generally transmitted along the long axis of the clavicle, that dislocation rarely occurs, and that the bone is generally broken rather than displaced. When dislocation does occur, the course which the dis- placed bone takes depends more upon the direction in which the violence is applied than upon the anatomical construction of the joint; it may be either forwards, backwards, or upwards. The chief point worthy of note, as regards the construction of the joint, in regard to dislocations, is the fact that, owing to the shape of the articular surfaces being so little adapted to each other, and that the strength of the joint mainly depends upon the ligaments, the displacement when reduced is very liable to recur, and hence it is extremely difficult to keep the end of the bone in its proper place. The Acromio-clavicular is an arthrodial joint, formed between the outer extremity of the clavicle and the upper edge of the acromion process of the scapula. Its ligaments are the The Superior Acromio-clavicular Ligament is a broad band, of a quadrilateral form, which covers the superior part of the articulation, extending between the upper part of the outer end of the clavicle and the adjoining part of the upper surface of the acromion. It is composed of parallel fibres, which interlace with the aponeurosis of the Trapezius and Deltoid muscles ; below, it is in contact with the interarticular fibro-cartilage (when it exists) and the synovial membranes. The Inferior Acromio-clavicular Ligament, somewhat thinner than the pre- ceding, covers the under part of the articulation, and is attached to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones. It is in relation, above, with the synovial membranes, and in rare cases with the interarticular fibro-cartilage ; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus. These two ligaments are continuous with each other in front and behind, and form a complete capsule round the joint. The Interarticular Fibro-cartilage is frequently absent in this articulation. When it exists, it generally only partially separates the articular surfaces, and occupies the upper part of the articulation. More rarely, it completely separates the joint into two cavities. The Synovial Membrane.—There is usually only one synovial membrane in this articulation, but when a complete interarticular fibro-cartilage exists, there are two synovial membranes. The Coraco-clavicular Ligament serves to connect the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula. It does not properly belong to this articulation, but as it forms a most efficient means in retaining the clavicle in contact with the acromial process, it is usually described with it. It consists of two fasciculi, called the trapezoid and conoid ligaments. The Trapezoid Ligament, the anterior and external fasciculus, is broad, thin, and quadrilateral : it is placed obliquely between the coracoid process and the II.

It is attached, below, to the upper surface of the coracoid process ; above, to the oblique line on the under surface of the clavicle. Its anterior border is free ; its posterior border is joined with the conoid ligament: the two forming by their junction a projecting angle. The Conoid Ligament, the posterior and internal fasciculus, is a dense band of fibres, conical in form, the base being turned upwards, the summit downwards. It is attached by its apex to a rough impression at the base of the coracoid process, internal to the preceding ; above, by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on Fig. 243.—The left shoulder-joint, scapulo-clavicular articulations, and proper ligaments of scapula. the under surface of the clavicle, and to a line proceeding internally from it for half an inch. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius and Deltoid; behind, with the Trapezius. They serve to limit rotation of the scapula ; the Trapezoid limiting rotation forwards, and the Conoid backwards. Actions.—The movements of this articulation are of two kinds, i. A gliding motion of the articular end of the clavicle on the acromion. 2. Rotation of the scapula forwards and backwards upon the clavicle, the extent of this rotation being- limited by the two portions of the coraco-clavicular ligament. The acromio-clavicular joint has important functions in the movements of the upper extremity. It has been well pointed out by Sir George Humphry, that if there had been no joint between the clavicle and scapula, the circular movement of the scapula on the ribs (as in throwing both shoulders backward or forward) would have been attended with a greater alteration in the direction of the shoulder than is consistent with the free use of the arm in such positions, and it would have been impossible to give a blow straight forward with the full force of the arm, that is to say, with the combined force of the scapula, arm, and forearm. ' This joint,' as he happily says, ' is so adjusted as to enable either bone to turn in a hinge-like319 LIGAMENTS OF SCAPULA manner upon a vertical axis drawn through the other, and it permits the surfaces of the scapula,, like the baskets in a roundabout swing, to look the same way in every position, or nearly so.' Again, when the whole arch formed by the clavicle and scapula rises and falls (in elevation or depression of the shoulders), the joint between these two bones enables the scapula still to maintain its lower part in contact with the ribs. Surface Form.—The position of the acromio-clavicular joint can generally be ascertained by the slightly enlarged extremity of the outer end of the clavicle, which causes it to project above the level of the acromion process of the scapula. Sometimes this enlargement is so considerable as to form a rounded eminence, which is easily to be felt. The joint lies in the plane of a vertical line passing up the middle of the front of the arm. Surgical Anaiomy.—Ov^ing^to the slanting shape of the articular surfaces of this joint, dislocation generally occurs downwards, that is to say, the acromion process of the scapula is dislocated under the outer end of the clavicle ; but dislocations in the opposite direction have been described. The displacement is often incomplete, on account of the strong coraco-clavicular ligaments, which remain untorn. The same difficulty exists, as in the sterno-clavicular dislocation, in maintaining the ends of the bone in position after reduction. III. Proper Ligaments of the Scapula (fig. 243) The proper ligaments of the scapula are, the Coraco-acromial. Transverse. The Coraco-acromial Ligament is a broad, thin, flat band, of a triangular shape, extended transversely above the upper part of the shoulder-joint, between the coracoid and acromial processes. It is attached, by its apex, to the summit of the acromion just in front of the articular surface for the clavicle; and by its broad base to the whole length of the outer border of the coracoid process. Its posterior fibres are directed obliquely backwards and inwards, its anterior fibres transversely inwards. This ligament completes the vault formed by the coracoid and acromion processes for the protection of the head of the humerus. It is in -relation, above, with the clavicle and under surface of the Deltoid; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus muscle, a bursa being interposed. Its anterior border is continuous with a dense cellular lamina that passes beneath the Deltoid upon the tendons of the Supra- and Infraspinatus muscles. This ligament is sometimes described as consisting of two marginal bands and a thinner intervening portion, the two bands being attached respectively to the apex and base of the coracoid process, and joining together at their attachment into the acromion process. When the Pectoralis minor is inserted, as sometimes is the case, into the capsule of the shoulder-joint instead of into the coracoid process, it passes between these two bands, and the intervening portion is then deficient. The Transverse or Coracoid (suprascapular) Ligament converts the supra- scapular notch into a foramen. It is a thin and flat fasciculus, narrower at the middle than at the extremities, attached, by one end, to the base of the coracoid process, and by the other to the inner extremity of the scapular notch. The suprascapular nerve passes through the foramen; the suprascapular vessels pass over the ligament. Movements of Scapula.—The scapula is capable of being moved upwards and downwards, forwards and backwards, or, by a combination of these movements, circumducted on the wall of the chest. The muscles which raise the scapula are the upper fibres of the Trapezius, the Levator anguli scapulae, and the two Rhomboids ; those which depress it are the lower fibres of the Trapezius, the Pectoralis minor and, through the clavicle, the Subclavius. The scapula is drawn backwards by the Rhomboids and the middle and lower fibres of the Trapezius, and foriuards by the Serratus magnus and Pectoralis minor, assisted when the arm is fixed by the Pectoralis major. The mobility of the scapula is very considerable, and greatly assists the movements of the arm at the shoulder- joint. Thus, in raising the arm from the side, the Deltoid and Supraspinatus canARTICULATIONS 320 only lift it to a right angle with the trunk, the further elevation of the limb being effected by the Trapezius moving the scapula on the wall of the chest. This mobihty is of special importance in ankylosis of the shoulder-joint, the movements of this bone compensating to a very great extent for the immobility of the joint. IV. Shoulder-Joint (fig. 243) The Shoulder is an enarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint. The bones entering into its formation are the large globular head of the humerus, which is received into the shalloAv glenoid cavity of the scapula, an arrangement which permits of very considerable movement, whilst the joint itself is protected against displacement by the tendons which surround it and by atmospheric pressure. The ligaments do Fig. 244.—Vertical sections through the shoulder-joint, the arm being vertical and horizontal. (After Henle.) BICEPS TEF?eS MAJOR not maintain the joint surfaces in apposition, because when they alone remain the humerus can be separated to a considerable extent from the glenoid cavity ; their use therefore is to limit the amount of movement. Above, the joint is protected by an arched vault, formed by the under surface of the coracoid and acromion processes, and the coraco-acromial ligament. The articular surfaces are covered by a layer of cartilage : that on the head of the humerus is thicker at the centre than at the circumference, the reverse being the case in the glenoid cavity. The liga- ments of the shoulder are, the Capsular. Coraco-humeral. Glenoid.* Transverse humeral. The Capsular Ligament completely encircles the articulation ; being attached, above, to the circumference of the glenoid cavity beyond the glenoid ligament; below, to the anatomical neck of the humerus, approaching nearer to the articular cartilage above than in the rest of its extent. It is thicker above and below than elsewhere, and is remarkably loose and lax, and much larger and longer than is necessary to keep the bones in contact, allowing them to be separated from each other more than an inch, an evident provision for that extreme freedom of move- ment which is peculiar to this articulation. Its external surface is strengthened, above, by the Supraspinatus ; below, by the long head of the Triceps ; externally, by the tendons of the Infraspinatus and Teres minor; and internally, by the tendon of the Subscapularis. The capsular ligament usually presents three ^ * The long tendon of origin of the Biceps muscle also acts as one of the ligaments of this joint. See the observations on p. 292, on the function of the muscles passing over more than one joint.SHOULDER-JOINT 321 openings: one at its inner side, below the coracoid process, partially filled up by the tendon of the Subscapularis ; it establishes a communication between the synovial membrane of the joint and a bursa beneath the tendon of that muscle. The second, which is not constant, is at the outer part, where a communication sometimes exists between the joint and a bursal sac belonging to the Infra- spinatus muscle. The third is seen in the lower border of the ligament, between the two tuberosities, for the passage of the long tendon of the Biceps muscle. The Coraco-humeral or Accessory Ligament is a broad band which strengthens the upper part of the capsular ligament. It arises from the outer border of the coracoid process, and passes obliquely downwards and outwards to the front of the great tuberosity of the humerus, being blended with the tendon of the Supra- spinatus muscle. This ligament is intimately united to the capsular in the greater part of its extent. The Transverse Humeral Ligament.—This is a broad band of fibrous tissue passing from the lesser to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and always limited to that portion of the bone which lies above the epiphysial line. It converts the bicipital groove into an osseo-aponeurotic canal, and is the analogue of the strong process of bone which connects the summits of the two tuberosities in the musk ox. Supplemental Bands of the Capsular Ligament.—In addition to the coraco- humeral or accessory ligament, the capsular ligament is strengthened by supple- mental bands in the interior of the joint. One of these bands is situated on the inner side of the joint, and passes from the inner edge of the glenoid cavity to the lower part of the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. This is sometimes known as Flood's ligament, and is supposed to correspond with the ligamentum teres of the hip-joint. A second of these bands is situated at the lower part of the joint, and passes from the under edge of the glenoid cavity to the under part of the neck of the humerus, and is known as Schlemm's ligament. The Glenoid Ligament is a fibro-cartilaginous rim attached round the margin of the glenoid cavity. It is triangular on section, the thickest portion being fixed to the circumference of the cavity, the free edge being thin and sharp. It is continuous above with the long tendon of the Biceps muscle, which bifurcates at the upper part of the cavity into two fasciculi, and becomes continuous with the fibrous tissue of the glenoid ligament. This ligament deepens the cavity for articula- tion, and protects the edges of the bone. It is lined by the synovial membrane. The Synovial Membrane is reflected from the margin of the glenoid cavity over the fibro-cartilaginous rim surrounding it ; it is then reflected over the internal surface of the capsular ligament, covers the lower part and sides of the neck of the humerus, and is continued a short distance over the cartilage covering the head of the bone. The long tendon of the Biceps muscle which passes through the capsular ligament is enclosed in a tubular sheath of synovial membrane, which is reflected upon it at the point where it perforates the capsule, and is continued around it as far as the summit of the glenoid cavity. The tendon of the Biceps is thus enabled to traverse the articulation, but it is not contained in the interior of the synovial cavity. The synovial membrane communicates with a large bursal sac beneath the tendon of the Subscapularis, by an opening at the inner side of the capsular ligament; it also occasionally communicates with another bursal sac, beneath the tendon of the Infraspinatus, through an orifice at its outer part. A third bursal sac, which does not communicate with the joint, is placed between the under surface of the Deltoid and the outer surface of the capsule. The Muscles in relation with the joint are, above, the Supraspinatus ; below, the long head of the Triceps ; internally, the Subscapularis ; externally, the Infra- spinatus and Teres minor; within, the long tendon of the Biceps. The Deltoid is placed most externally, and covers the articulation on its outer side, as well as in front and behind. The Arteries supplying the joint are articular branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex, and suprascapular. YAETICULATIONS 322 The Nerves are derived from the circumflex and suprascapular. Actions.—The shoulder-joint is capable of movement in every direction, forwards, backwards, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and rotation. The humerus is drawn fonvards by the Pectoralis major, anterior fibres of the Deltoid, Coraco- brachialis, and by the Biceps, when the forearm is flexed ; backivards, by the Latis- simus dorsi, Teres major, posterior fibres of the Deltoid, and by the Triceps when the forearm is extended ; it is abducted (elevated) by the Deltoid and Supraspinatus ; it is adducted (depressed) by the Subscapularis, Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major; it is rotated outtvards by the Infraspinatus and Teres minor ; and it is rotated imoards by the Subscapularis, Latissimus dorsi, Teres major, and Pectoralis major. The most striking peculiarities in this joint are : i. The large size of the head of the humerus in comparison with the depth of the glenoid cavity, even when supplemented by the glenoid ligament. 2. The looseness of the capsule of the joint. 3. The intimate connection of the capsule with the muscles attached to the head of the humerus. 4. The peculiar relation of the biceps tendon to the joint. It is in consequence of the relative size of the two articular surfaces that the joint enjoys such free movement in every possible direction. When these movements of the arm are arrested in the shoulder-joint by the contact of the bony surfaces, and by the tension of the corresponding fibres of the capsule, together with that of the muscles acting as accessory ligaments, they can be carried considerably further by the movements of the scapula, involving, of course, motion at the acromio- and sterno-clavicular joints. These joints are therefore to be regarded as accessory structures to the shoulder-joint.* The extent of these movements of the scapula is very considerable, especially in extreme elevation of the arm, which movement is best accomplished when the arm is thrown somewhat forward, since the articular surface of the humerus is broader in the middle than at either end, especially the lower, so that the range of elevation directly forward is less, and that directly bo.ckward still more restricted. The great width of the central portion of the humeral head also allows of very free horizontal movement when the arm is raised to a right angle, in which movement the arch formed by the acromion, the coracoid process, and the coraco-acromial ligament, constitutes a sort of supple- mental articular cavity for the head of the bone. The looseness of the capsule is so great that the arm will fall about an inch from the scapula when the muscles are dissected from the capsular ligament, and an opening made in it to remove the atmospheric pressure. The movements of the joint, therefore, are not regulated by the capsule so much as by the surrounding muscles and by the pressure of the atmosphere, an arrangement which ' renders the movements of the joint much more easy than they would otherwise have been, and permits a swinging, pendulum-like vibration of the limb when the muscles are at rest' (Humphry). The fact, also, that in all ordinary positions of the joint the capsule is not put on the stretch, enables the arm to move freely in all direc- tions. Extreme movements are checked by the tension of appropriate portions of the capsule, as well as by the interlocking of the bones. Thus it is said that ' abduction is checked by the contact of the great tuberosity with the upper edge of the glenoid cavity, adduction by the tension of the coraco-humeral ligament' (Beaunis et Bouchard). The intimate union of the tendons of the four short muscles with the capsule converts these muscles into elastic and spontaneously acting ligaments of the joint, and it is regarded as being also intended to prevent the folds into which all portions of the capsule would alternately fall in the varying positions of the joint from being driven between the bones by the pressure of the atmosphere. The peculiar relations of the Biceps tendon to the shoulder-joint appear to sub- serve various purposes. In the first place, by its connection with both the shoulder and elbow the muscle harmonises the action of the two joints, and acts as an elastic ligament in all positions, in the manner previously adverted to.j Next, it * See p. 318. t See p. 292.SHOULDEK-JOINT 323 strengthens the upper part of the articular cavity, and prevents the head of the humerus from being pressed up against the acromion process, when the Deltoid contracts, instead of forming the centre of motion in the glenoid cavity. By its passage along the bicipital groove it assists in rendering the head of the humerus steady in the various movements of the arm. When the arm is raised from the side it assists the Supra- and Infraspinatus in rotating the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity. It also holds the head of the bone firmly in contact with the glenoid cavity, and prevents its slipping over its lower edge, or being displaced by the action of the Latissimus dorsi and Pectoralis major, as in climbing and many other movements. Surface Form.—The direction and position of the shoulder-joint may be indicated by a line drawn from the middle of the coraco-acromial ligament, in a curved direction, with its convexity inwards, to the innermost part of that portion of the head of the humerus which can be felt in the axilla when the arm is forcibly abducted from the side. When the arm hangs by the side, not more than one-third of the head of the bone is in contact with the glenoid cavity, and three-quarters of its circumference is in front of a vertical line drawn from the anterior border of the acromion process. Surgical Anatomy.—Owing to the construction of the shoulder-joint and the freedom of movement which it enjoys, as well as in consequence of its exposed situation, it is more frequently dislocated than any other joint in the body. Dislocation occurs when the arm is abducted, and when, therefore, the head of the humerus presses against the lower and front part of the capsule, which is the thinnest and least supported part of the ligament. The rent in the capsule almost invariably takes place in this situation, and through it the head of the bone escapes, so that the dislocation in most instances is primarily subglenoid. The head of the bone does .not usually remain in this situation, but generally assumes some other position, which varies according to the direction and amount of force producing the dislocation and the relative strength of the muscles in front and behind the joint. In consequence of the muscles at the back being stronger than those in front, and espe- cially on account of the long head of the Triceps preventing the bone passing backwards, dislocation forwards is much more common than backwards.'^ The most frequent position which the head of the humerus ultimately assumes is on the front of the neck of the scapula, beneath the coracoid process, and hence named subcoracoid. Occasionally, in consequence probably of a greater amount of force being brought to bear on the limb, the head is driven farther mwards, and rests on the upper part of the front of the chest, beneath the clavicle (subclavicular). Sometimes it remains in the position in which it was primarily displaced, resting on the axillary border of the scapula (subglenoid), and rarely it passes backwards and remains in the infraspinatus fossa, beneath the spine (subspinous). The shoulder-joint is sometimes the seat of all those inflammatory affections, both acute and chronic, which attack joints, though perhaps less frequently than some other joints of equal size and importance. Acute synovitis may result from injury, rheumatism, or pytemia, or may follow secondarily on the so-called acute epiphysitis of infants. It is attended with effusion into the joint, and when this occurs the capsule is evenly distended, and the contour of the joint rounded. Special projections may occur at the site of the openings in the capsular ligament. Thus a swelling may appear just in front of the joint, internal to the lesser tuberosity, from effusion into the bursa beneath the Subscapularis muscle; or, again, a swelling which is sometimes bilobed may be seen in the interval between the Deltoid and Pectoralis major muscles, from effusion into the diverticulum, which runs down the bicipital groove with the tendon of the biceps. The effusion into the synovial membrane can be best ascertained by examination from the axilla, where a soft, elastic, fluctuating swelling can usually be felt. Tubercular arthritis not unfrequently attacks the shoulder-joint, and may lead to total destruction of the articulation, when ankylosis may result, or long protracted suppuration may necessitate excision. This joint is also one of those which is most liable to be the seat of osteo-arthritis, and may also be affected in gout and rheumatism ; or in locomotor ataxy, when it becomes the seat of Charcot's disease. Excision of the shoulder-joint may be required in cases of arthritis (especially the tuber- cular form) which have gone on to destruction of the articulation ; in compound dislocations and fractures, particularly those arising from gunshot injuries, in which there has been extensive injury to the head of the bone ; in some cases of old unreduced dislocation, where there is much pain; and possibly in some few cases of growth connected with the upper end of the bone. The operation is best performed by making an incision from the middle of the coraco-acromial lic^ament down the arm for about three inches : this will expose the bicij)ital groove and the tendon of the biceps, which may be either divided or hooked out of the way, according as to whether it is implicated in the disease or not. The capsule is then freely opened, and the muscles attached to the greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus divided. The head of the bone can then be thrust out of the wound and sawn Y 2324 AKTICULATIONS off; or divided with a narrow saw in situ and subsequently removed. The section should be made, if possible, just below the articular surface, so as to leave the bone as lon»- as possible. The glenoid cavity must then be examined, and gouged if carious. V. Elbow-Joint The Elbow is a ginglymus or hinge-joint. The bones entering into its forma- tion are the trochlear surface of the humerus, "which is received into the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and admits of the movements peculiar to this joint, viz. flexion and extension ; whilst the lesser, or radial, head of the humerus articulates with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius ; the circumference of the head of the radius articulates with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, allowing of the movement of rotation of the radius on the ulna, the chief action of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. ' The articular surfaces are covered with a thin layer of cartilage, and connected together by a capsular ligament of unequal thickness, being especially thickened on its two sides and, to a less extent, in front and behind. These thickened portions are usually described as distinct ligaments under the following names :— Anterior. Internal Lateral. Posterior. External Lateral. The orbicular ligament of the upper radio-ulnar articulation must also be reckoned among the ligaments of the elboAV. The Anterior Ligament (fig. 245) is a broad and thin fibrous layer, which covers the anterior surface of the joint. It is attached to the front of the internalELBOW-JOINT condyle and to the front of the humerus immediately above the coronoid fossa ; below, to the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna and orbicular ligament, being continuous on each side with the lateral ligaments. Its superficial fibres pass obliquely from the inner condyle of the humerus outwards ' to the fe^i^l§iii^ The middle fibres, vertical in direction, pass from the upper part of the coronoid depression and become partly blended with the preceding, but mainly inserted into the anterior surface of the coronoid process. The deep or transverse set intersects these at right angles. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the Brachialis anticus, except at its outermost part; behind, with the synovial membrane. The Posterior Ligament (fig. 246) is a thin and loose membranous fold, attached, above, to the lower end of the humerus, on a level with the upper part of the olecranon fossa ; below, to the margin of the olecranon. The superficial or trans- verse fibres pass between the adjacent margins of the olecranon fossa. The deeper portion consists of vertical fibres, which pass from the upper part of the olecranon fossa to the margin of the olecranon. This ligament is in relation, behind, with the tendon of the Triceps and the Anconeus ; in front, with the synovial membrane. The Internal Lateral Ligament (fig. 245) is a thick triangular band consisting of two portions, an anterior and posterior, united by a thinner intermediate portion. The anterior jjortion, directed obliquely forwards, is attached, above, by its apex, to the front part of the internal condyle of the humerus ; and, below, by its broad base, to the inner margin of the coronoid process. The posterior portion, also of triangular form, is attached, above, by its apex, to the lower and back part of the internal condyle ; below, to the inner margin of the olecranon. Between these two bands a few intermediate fibres descend from the internal condyle to blend with a transverse band of ligamentous tissue which bridges across the notch between the olecranon and coronoid processes. This ligament is in relation, internally, with the Triceps and Flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, and the ulnar nerve, and gives origin to part of the Flexor sublimis digitorum. The External Lateral Ligament (fig. 246) is a short and narrow fibrous band, less distinct than the internal, attached, above, to a depression below the external condyle of the humerus ; below, to the orbicular ligament, some of its most posterior fibres passing over that ligament, to be inserted into the outer margin of the ulna. This ligament is intimately blended with the tendon of origin of the Supinator brevis muscle. The Synovial Membrane is very extensive. It covers the margin of the articular surface of the humerus, and lines the coronoid and olecranon fossae on that bone; from these points, it is reflected over the anterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments ; and forms a pouch between the lesser sigmoid cavity, the internal surface of the orbicular ligament, and the circumference of the head of the radius. Between the capsular ligament and the synovial membrane are three masses of fat : one, the largest, above the olecranon fossa, which is pressed into the fossa by the triceps during flexion ; a second, over the coronoid fossa; and a third, over the radial fossa. These are pressed into their respective fossae during extension. The Muscles in relation with the joint are, in front, the Brachialis anticus ; behind, the Triceps and Anconeus ; externally, the Supinator brevis, and the common tendon of origin of the Extensor muscles ; internally, the common tendon of origin of the Flexor muscles, and the Flexor carpi ulnaris, with the ulnar nerve. The Arteries supplying the joint are derived from the communicating branches between the superior profunda, inferior profunda, and anastomotica magna arteries, branches of the brachial, with the anterior, posterior, and interosseous recurrent branches of the ulnar, and the recurrent branch of the radial. These vessels form a complete chain of inosculation around the joint. The Nerves are derived from the ulnar, as it passes between the internalARTICULATIONS 326 condyle and the olecranon ; a filament from the mnscnlo-cutaneous (Riidinger), and two from the median (Macalister). Actions.—The elbow-joint comprises three different portions : viz. the joint be- tween the ulna and humerus, that between the head of the radius and the humerus, and the superior radio-ulnar articulation, described below. All these articular sur- faces are invested by a common synovial meinbrane, and the movements of the whole joint should be studied together. The com- bination of the movements of flexion and extension of the forearm with those of pro- nation and supination of the hand, which is ensured by the two being performed at the same joint, is essential to the accuracy of the various minute movements of the hand. The portion of the joint between the ulna and humerus is a simple hinge-joint, and allows of movements of flexion and extension only. Owing to the obliquity of the trochlear surface of the humerus, this movement does not take place in a straight line ; so that Avhen the forearm is extended and supinated, the axis of the arm and forearm is not in the same line, but the one portion of the limb forms an angle with the others, and the hand, with the forearm, is directed out- wards. During flexion, on the other hand, the forearm and the hand tend to approach the middle line of the body, and thus enable the hand to be easily carried to the face. The shape of the articular surface of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions accurately adapted to the opposing surfaces of the olecranon, prevents any lateral movement. Flexion is produced by the action of the Biceps and Brachialis anticus, assisted by the muscles arising from the internal condyle of the humerus and the Supinator longus ; extension, by the Triceps and Anconeus, assisted by the extensors of the wrist and by the Extensor communis digitorum and Extensor minimi digiti. The joint between the head of the radius and the capitellum or radial head of the humerus is an arthrodial joint. The bony surfaces would of themselves con- stitute an enarthrosis and allow of movement in all directions, were it not for the orbicular ligament by which the head of the radius is bound down firmly to the sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and which prevents any separation of the two bones laterally. It is to the same Hgament that the head of the radius owes its security from dislocation, which would otherwise constantly occur, as a consequence of the shallowness of the cup-like surface on the head of the radius. In fact, but for this ligament, the tendon of the biceps would be liable to pull the head of the radius out of the joint.* In complete extension, the head of the radius glides so far back on the outer condyle that its edge is plainly felt at the back of the articulation. Flexion and extension of the elbow-joint are limited by the tension of the structures on the front and back of the joint ; the limitation of flexion being also aided by the soft structures of the arm and forearm coming in contact. In combination with any position of flexion or extension, the head of the radius can be rotated in the upper radio-ulnar joint, carrying the hand with it. The hand is articulated to the lower surface of the radius only, and the concave or sigmoid surface on the lower end of the radius travels round the lower end of * Humphry, oiJ. cit. p. 419. Fig. 247.—Sagittal section of the right elbow-joint, taken somewhat obliquely and seen from the radial aspect. (After Branne.)ELBOW-JOINT 327 the ulna. The latter bone is excluded from the wrist-jomt (as will be seen in the sequel) by the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Thus, rotation of the head of the radius round an axis which passes through the centre of the radial head of the humerus, imparts circular movement to the hand through a very considerable arc. Surface Form.—If the forearm be slightly flexed on the arm, a curved crease or fold with its convexity downwards may be seen running across the front of the elbow, extending from one condyle to the other. The centre of this fold is some slight distance above the line of the joint. The position of the radio-Immeral portion of the joint can be at once ascertained by feeling for a slight groove or depression between the head of the radius and the capitellimi of the humerus at the back of the articulation. Surgical Anatomy.—From the great breadth of the joint, and the manner in which the articular surfaces are interlocked, and also on account of the strong lateral ligaments and the support which the joint derives from the mass of muscles attached to each condyle of the humerus, lateral_divsplacement of the bones is very uncommon. Whereas antero- posterior disloc'ation, on account of the shortness of the antero-posterior diameter, the weakness of the anterior and posterior ligaments, and the want of support of muscles, much more frequentl}^ takes place. Dislocation backwards takmg place when the forearm is in a position of extension, and forwards when in a position of flexion. For, in the former position, that of extension, the coronoid process is not interlocked into the coronoid fossa, and loses its grip to a certain extent, whereas the olecranon process is in the olecranon fossa, and entirely prevents displacement forwards. On the other hand, during flexion, the coronoid process is in the coronoid fossa, and prevents dislocation backwards, while the olecranon loses its grip and is not so efficient, as during extension, in preventing a forward displacement. When lateral dislocation does take place it is generally incomplete. Dislocation of the elbow-joint is of common occurrence in children, far more common than dislocation of any other articulation, for, as a rule, fracture of a bone more frequently takes place, under the application of any severe violence, in young persons than dislocation. In lesions of this joint there is often very great difficulty in ascertaining the exact nature of the injury. The elbow-joint is occasionally^ the seat of acute synovitis. The synovial membrane then becomes distended with fluid, the bulging showing itself principally around the olecranon process, that is to say, on its inner and outer sides and above, in consequence of the laxness of the posterior ligament. Occasionally a weU-marked, triangular projection may be seen on the outer side of the olecranon, from bulging of the synovial membrane beneath the Anconeus muscle. Again, there is often some swelling just above the head of the radius, in the line of the radio-humeral joint. There is generally not much swelling at the front of the joint, though sometimes deep-seated fulness beneath the Brachialis amicus may be noted. When suppuration occurs the abscess usually points at one or other border of the Triceps muscle ; occasionally the pus discharges itself in front, near the insertion of the Brachialis anticus muscle. Chronic synovitis, usually of tubercular origin, is of common occurrence in the elbow-joint: under these circumstances the forearm tends to assume the position of semi-flexion, which is that of greatest ease and relaxation of ligaments. It should be borne in mind, that should ankylosis occur in this or the extended position, the limb will not be nearly so useful as if ankylosed in a position of rather less than a right angle. Loose cartilages are sometimes met with in the elbow-joint, not so commonly, however, as in the knee ; nor do they, as a rule, give rise to such urgent symptoms as in this articulation, and rarely require operative interference. The elbow-joint is also sometimes affected with osteo-arthritis, but this affection is less common in this articulation than in some other of the larger joints. Excision of the elbow is principally required for three conditions : viz. tubercular arthritis, injury and its results, and faulty ankylosis; but may be necessary for some other rarer conditions, such as disorganising arthritis after pyaemia, unreduced dislocations, and osteo-arthritis. The results of the operation are, as a rule, more favourable than those of excision of any other joint, and it is one, therefore, that the surgeon should never hesitate to perform, especially in the first three of the conditions mentioned above. The operation is best performed by a single vertical incision down the back of the joint, a transverse incision, over the outer condyle, being added if the parts are much thickened and fixed. A straight incision is made about four inches long, the mid-point of which is on a level with and a little to the inner side of the tip of the olecranon. This incision is made down to the bone, through the substance of the Triceps muscle. The operator with the point of his knife and guarding the soft parts with his thumb-nail, separates them from the bone. In doing this there are two structures which he should carefully avoid: the ulnar nerve, which lies parallel to his incision, but a little internal, as it courses down between the internal condyle and the olecranon process, and the prolongation of the Triceps into the deep fascia of the forearm over the Anconeus muscle. Having cleared the bones and divided the lateral and posterior ligaments, the forearm is strongly flexed and the ends of the bone turned out and sawn off. The section of the humerus should be through the base of the condyles, that of the ulna and radius should be just below the level of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna and the neck of the radius. In this328 AKTICULATIONS operation the object is to obtain such union as shall allow free motion of the bones of the forearm ; and, therefore, passive motion must be commenced early, that is to say, about the tenth day. VI. Eadio-ulnar Articulations The articulation of the radius with the ulna is effected by ligaments, which connect together both extremities as well as the shafts of these bones. They may, consequently, be subdivided into three sets :—i. The superior radio-ulnar, which is a portion of the elbow-joint; 2. the middle radio-ulnar ; and, 3. the inferior radio- ulnar articulations, I. SuPEEioR Eadio-ulnar Articulation This articulation is a trochoid or pivot-joint. The bones entering into its formation are the inner side of the circumference of the head of the radius rotating within the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Its only ligament is the annular or orbicular. The Orbicular Ligament (fig. 246) is a strong, fiat band of ligamentous fibres, which surrounds the head of the radius, and retains it in firm connection with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. It forms about four-fifths of a fibrous ring, attached by each end to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity, and is smaller at the loAver part of its circumference than above, by which means the head of the radius is more securely held in its position. Its outer surface is strengthened by the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and aftbrds origin to part of the Supinator brevis muscle. Its inner surface is smooth, and lined by synovial membrane. The synovial membrane is continuous with that which lines the elbow-joint. Actions.-—The movement which takes place in this articulation is limited to rotation of the head of the radius within the orbicular ligament, and upon the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna ; rotation forwards being called pronation ; rotation backwards, sujjination. Supination is performed by the Biceps and Supinator brevis, assisted to a slight extent by the Extensor muscles of the thumb and, in certain positions, by the Supinator longus. Pronation is performed by the Pronator radii teres and the Pronator quadratus, assisted, in some positions, by the Supinator longus. Surface Form.—The position of the superior radio-ulnar joint is marked on the surface of the body by the little dimple on the back of the forearm which indicates the position of the head of the radius. Surgical Anatomy—Dislocation of the head of the radius alone is not an uncommon accident, and occurs most frequently in young persons from falls on the hand when the forearm is extended and supinated, the head of the bone being displaced forwards. It is attended by rupture of the orbicular ligament. 2. Middle Eadio-ulnar Articulation The interval between the shafts of the radius and ulna is occupied by two ligaments. Oblique. Interosseous. The Oblique or Round Ligament (fig. 245 ) is a small, flattened fibrous band, which extends obliquely downwards and outwards, from the tubercle of the ulna at the base of the coronoid process, to the radius a little below the bicipital tuberosity. Its fibres run in the opposite direction to those of the interosseous ligament; and it appears to be placed as a substitute for it in the upper part of the interosseous interval. This ligament is sometimes Avanting. The Interosseous Membrane js a broad and thin plane of fibrous tissue descending obliquely downwards and inwards, from the interosseous ridge on the radius to that on the ulna. It is deficient above, commencing about an inch beneath the tubercle of the radius ; is broader in the middle than at either extremity ; and presents an oval aperture just above its lower margin for the passage of the329 EADIO-ULNAR JOINTS anterior interosseous vessels to the back of the forearm. This ligament serves to connect the bones, and to increase the extent of surface for the attachment of the deep muscles. Betv^een its upper border and the oblique ligament an interval exists, through which the posterior interosseous vessels pass. Two or three fibrous bands are occasionally found on the posterior surface of this membrane which descend obliquely from the ulna towards the radius, and which have consequently a direction contrary to that of the other fibres. It is in relation, in front, by its upper three-fourths with the Flexor longus pollicis on the outer side, and with the Flexor profundus digitorum on the inner, lying upon the interval between which are the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve ; by its lower fourth with the Pronator quadratus ; behind, with the Supinator brevis, Extensor ossis metacarpi Fig. 248.—Ligaments of wrist and hand. Anterior view. pollicis, Extensor brevis pollicis. Extensor longus pollicis, Extensor indicis; and, near the wrist, with the anterior interosseous artery and posterior inter- osseous nerve. 3. Infekioe Radio-ulnar Articulation This is a pivot-joint, formed by the head of the ulna received into the sigmoid cavity at the inner side of the lower end of the radius. The articular surfaces are covered by a thin layer of cartilage, and connected together by the following ligaments :— Anterior Radio-ulnar. Posterior Radio-ulnar. Interarticular Fibro- cartilage. The Anterior Radio-ulnar Ligament (fig. 248) is a narrow band of fibres extending from the anterior margin of the sigmoid cavity of the radius to the anterior surface of the head of the ulna. The Posterior Radio-ulnar Ligament (fig. 249) extends between similar points on the posterior surface of the articulation. The Interarticular Fibro-cartilage (fig. 251) is triangular in shape and is placed transversely beneath the head of the ulna, binding the lower end of this bone and the radius firmly together. Its circumference is thicker than its centre, which is thin and occasionally perforated. It is attached by its apex to a depression330 ARTICULATIONS which separates the styloid process of the nhia from the head of that bone ; and by its base, which is thin, to the prominent edge of the radius, which separates the sigmoid cavity from the carpal articulating surface. Its margins are united to the ligaments of the wrist-joint. Its tipper surface, smooth and concave, articulates with the head of the ulna, forming an arthrodial joint; its under surface, also concave and smooth, forms part of the wrist-joint and articulates with the cuneiform bone. Both surfaces are lined by a synovial membrane : the upper surface, by one peculiar to the radio-ulnar articulation ; the under surface, by the synovial membrane of the wrist. The Synovial Membrane (fig. 251) of this articulation has been called, from its extreme looseness, the memhrana sacciformis ; it extends horizontally inwards between the head of the ulna and the interarticular fibro-cartilage, and upwards between the radius and the ulna, forming here a very loose cul-de-sac. The quantity of synovia which it contains is usually considerable. Actions.—The movement in the inferior radio-ulnar articulation is just the reverse of that between the two bones above. It consists of a movement of Fig. 249.—Ligaments of wrist and hand. Posterior view. rotation of the lower end of the radius round an axis which corresponds to the centre of the head of the ulna. When the radius rotates forwards, pronation of the forearm and hand is the result; and when backwards, supination. It will thus be seen that in pronation and supination of the forearm and hand the radius describes a segment of a cone, the axis of which extends from the centre of the head of the radius to the middle of the head of the ulna. In this movement, however, the ulna is not quite stationary, but rotates a little in the opposite direction. So that it also describes the segment of a cone, though of smaller size than that described by the radius. The movement which causes this alteration in the position of the head of the ulna takes place principally at the shoulder-joint by a rotation of the humerus, but possibly also to a slight extent at the elbow-joint.* Surface Form.—The position of the inferior radio-nlnar joint may be ascertained by feeling for a slight groove at the back of the wrist, between the prominent head of the ulna and the lower end of the radius, when the forearm is in a state of almost complete pronation. * See Journ. of Anat. and Phys., vol. xix. parts ii., iii., and iv.331 WEIST-JOINT VII. Eadio-caepal oe Weist-joint The Wrist is a condyloid articulation. The parts entering into its formation are the lower end of the radius and under surface of the interarticular fibro- cartilage, which form together the receiving cavity; and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones which form the condyle. The articular surface of the radius and the under surface of the interarticular fibro-cartilage are the receiving cavity, forming together a transversely elliptical concave surface. The articular surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones form together a smooth, convex surface, the condyle, which is received into the concavity above mentioned. All the bony surfaces of the articulation are covered with cartilage, and connected together by a capsule, which is divided into the following ligaments :— External Lateral. Internal Lateral. Anterior. Posterior. Fig. 250.—Longitudinal section of the right forearm, hand, and third finger, viewed from the ulnar aspect. (After Braune.) EWSOR SEC. The External Lateral Ligament (radio-carpal) (fig. 248) extends from the summit of the styloid process of the radius to the outer side of the scaphoid, some of its fibres being prolonged to the trapezium and annular ligament. The Internal Lateral Ligament (?^7no-C(%7paZ) is a rounded cord, attached, above, to the ex- tremity of the styloid process of the ulna ; and dividing below into two fasciculi, which are attached, one to the inner side of the cuneiform bone, the other to the pisiform bone and annular ligament. The Anterior Ligament is a broad mem- branous band, attached, above, to the anterior margin of the lower end of the radius, its sty- loid process and the ulna ; its fibres pass down- wards and inwards to be inserted into the palmar surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones, some of the fibres being con- tinued to the OS magnum. In addition to this broad membrane, there is a distinct rounded fasciculus, superficial to the rest, which passes from the base of the styloid process of the ulna to the semilunar and cuneiform bones. This ligament is perforated by numerous apertures for the passage of vessels, and is in relation, in front, with the tendons of the Flexor profundus digitorum and Flexor longus pollicis ; behind, with the synovial membrane of the wrist- joint. The Posterior Ligament (fig. 249), less thick and strong than the anterior, is attached, above, to the posterior border of the lower end of the radius ; its fibres pass obliquely down- wards and inwards, to be attached to the dorsal surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cunei- form bones, being continuous with those of the dorsal carpal ligaments. This ligament is in relation, behind, with the extensor tendons of the fing( synovial membrane of the wrist. in front, with the332 AKTICULATIONS The Synovial Membrane (fig. 251) lines the inner surface of the ligaments above described, extending from the loAver end of the radius and interarticular fibro-cartilage above to the articular surfaces of the carpal bones below. It is loose and lax and presents numerous folds, especially behind. Relations.—The wrist-joint is covered in front by the flexor, and behind by the extensor tendons ; it is also in relation with the radial and ulnar arteries. The Arteries supplying the joint are the anterior and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar, the anterior and posterior interosseous, and some ascending branches from the deep palmar arch. The Nerves are derived from the ulnar and posterior interosseous. Actions.—The movements permitted in this joint are flexion, extension, abduc- tion, adduction, and circumduction. Its actions will be further studied with those of the carpus, with which they are combined. Surface Form.—The line of the radio-carpal joint is on a level with the apex of the styloid process of the ulna. Surgical Anatomy.—The wrist-joint is rarely dislocated, its strength depending mainly upon the numerous strong tendons which surround the articulation. Its security is further provided for by the number of small bones of which the carpus is made up, and whirh are united by very strong ligaments. The slight movement which takes place between the several bones serves to break the jars that result from falls or blows on the hand. Dislocation backwards, which is the more common, simulates to a considerable extent CoUes' fracture of the radius, and is liable to be mistaken for it. The diagnosis can be easily made out by observing the relative position of the styloid processes of the radius and the ulna. In the natural condition the styloid process of the radius is on a lower level, i.e. nearer the ground, when the arm hangs by the side, than that of the ulna, and the same would be the case in dislocation. In CoUes' fracture, on the other hand, the styloid process of the radius is on the same, or even a higher level than that of the ulna. The wrist-joint is occasionally the seat of acute synovitis, the result of traumatism, or arising in the rheumatic or pyaemic state. "When the synovial sac is distended with fluid, the swelling is greatest on the dorsal aspect of the wrist, showing a general fulness, with some bulging between the tendons. The inflammation is prone to extend to the inter- carpal joints and to attack also the sheaths of the tendons in the neighbom-liood. Chronic inflammation of the wrist is generally tubercular, and often leads to similar disease in the synovial sheaths of adjacent tendons and of the intercarpal joints. The disease, therefore, when progressive, often leads to necrosis of the carpal bones, and the result is often unsatisfactory. VIII. Aeticulatioxs of the Caepus These articulations may be subdivided into three sets— 1. The Articulations of the First Kow of Carpal Bones. 2. The Articulations of the Second Eow of Carpal Bones. 3. The Articulations of the Two Rows with each other. I. Articulations of the First Row of Carpal Bones These are arthrodial joints. The ligaments connecting the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones are— Dorsal. Palmar. Two Interosseous. The Dorsal Ligaments are placed transversely behind the bones of the first row; they connect the scaphoid and semilunar, and the semilunar and cuneiform. The Palmar Ligaments connect the scaphoid and semilunar, and the semilunar and cuneiform bones ; they are less strong than the dorsal, and placed very deeply under the anterior ligament of the wrist. The Interosseous Ligaments (fig. 251) are two narrow bundles of fibrous tissue, connecting the semilunar bone, on one side with the scaphoid, and on the other with the cuneiform. They are on a level with the superior surfaces of these bones, and close the upper part of the spaces between them. Their upper surfaces are smooth, and form with the bones the convex articular surfaces of the wrist- joint.OF THE CAEPUS 333 The ligaments connecting the pisiform bone are— Capsular. Two palmar ligaments. The Capsular Ligament is a thin membrane which connects the pisiform bone to the cuneiform. It is lined with a separate synovial membrane. The two Palmar Ligaments are two strong fibrous bands which connect the pisiform to the unciform, the piso-uncinate, and to the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, the piso-metacaiycd ligament (fig. 248). 2. Aeticulations of the Second Row of Caepal Bones These are also arthrodial joints. The articular surfaces are covered with carti- lage, and connected by the following ligaments :— Dorsal. Palmar. Three Interosseous. The Dorsal Ligaments extend transversely from one bone to another on the dorsal surface, connecting the trapezium with the trapezoid, the trapezoid with the OS magnum, and the os magnum with the unciform. The Palmar Ligaments have a similar arrangement on the palmar surface. The three Interosseous Ligaments, much thicker than those of the first row, are placed one between the os magnum and the unciform, a second between the OS magnum and the trapezoid, and a third between the trapezium and trapezoid. The first of these is much the strongest, and the third is sometimes wanting. Sometimes a slender interosseous band connects the os magnum and the scaphoid. 3. Aeticulations of the Two Rows of Caepal Bones with each othee The joint between the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform, and the second row of the carpus, or the mid-carjjal joint, is made up of three distinct portions ; in the centre the head of the os magnum and the superior surface of the unciform articulate with the deep, cup-shaped cavity formed by the scaphoid and semilunar bones, and constitute a sort of ball-and-socket joint. On the outer side the trapezium and trapezoid articulate with the scaphoid, and on the inner side the unciform articulates with the cuneiform, forming gliding joints. The ligaments are :— Anterior or Palmar. External Lateral. Posterior or Dorsal. Internal Lateral. The Anterior or Palmar Ligaments consist of short fibres, which pass, for the most part, from the palmar surface of the bones of the first row to the front of the OS magnum. The Posterior or Dorsal Ligaments consist of short, irregular bundles of fibres passing between the bones of the first and second row on the dorsal surface of the carpus. The Lateral Ligaments are very short: they are placed, one on the radial, the other on the ulnar side of the carpus ; the former, the stronger and more distinct, connecting the scaphoid and trapezium bones, the latter the cuneiform and unciform ; they are continuous with the lateral ligaments of the wrist-joint. The Synovial Membrane of the Carpus is very extensive; it passes from the under surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones to the upper surface of the bones of the second row, sending upwards two prolongations—between the scaphoid and semilunar, and the semilunar and cuneiform—sending downwards three prolongations between the four bones of the second row, which are further continued onwards into the carpo-metacarpal joints of the four inner metacarpal bones, and also for a short distance between the metacarpal bones. There is a separate synovial membrane between the pisiform and cuneiform bones.AKTICULATIONS 334 Actions.—The articulation of the hand and wrist, considered as a whole, is divided into three parts: (i) the radius and the interarticular fibro-cartilage; (2) the meniscus, formed by the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform—the pisiform bone having no essential part in the movements of the hand ; (3) the hand proper, the metacarpal bones with the four carpal bones on which they are supported, viz. the trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform. These three elements form two joints: (i) the superior (wrist-joint proper), between the meniscus and bones of the forearm ; (2) the inferior, between the hand and meniscus (transverse or mid-carpal joint). (1) The articulation between the forearm and carpus is a true condyloid arti- culation, and therefore all movements but rotation are permitted. Flexion and extension are the most free, and of these a greater amount of extension than flexion is permitted on account of the articulating surfaces extending further on the dorsal than on the palmar aspect of the carpal bones. In this movement the carpal bones rotate on a transverse axis drawn between the tips of the styloid processes of the radius and ulna. A certain amount of adduction (or ulnar flexion) and abduction (or radial flexion) is also permitted. Of these the former is considerably greater in extent than the latter. In this movement the carpus revolves upon an antero-posterior axis drawn through the centre of the wrist. Finally, circumduction is permitted by the consecutive movements of adduction, extension, abduction, and flexion, with intermediate movements between them. There is no rotation, but this is provided for by the supination and pronation of the radius on the ulna. The movement of flexion is performed by the Flexor carpi radialis, the Flexor carpi ulnaris, and the Palmaris longus ; extension by the Extensor carpi radialis longior et brevior and the Extensor carpi ulnaris ; adduction (ulnar flexion) by the Flexor carpi ulnaris and the Extensor carpi ulnaris ; and ahduction (radial flexion) by the Extensors of the thumb, and the Extensor carpi radialis longior et brevior and the Flexor carpi radialis. (2) The chief movements permitted in the transverse or mid-carpal joint are flexion and extension and a slight amount of rotation. In flexion and extension, which is the movement most freely enjoyed, the trapezium and trapezoid on the radial side and the unciform on the ulnar side glide forwards and backwards on the scaphoid and cuneiform respectively, while the head of the os magnum and the superior surface of the unciform rotate in the cup-shaped cavity of the scaphoid and semilunar. Flexion at this joint is freer than extension. A very trifling amount of rotation is also permitted, the head of the os magnum rotating round a vertical axis drawn through its own centre, while at the same time a slight gliding movement takes place in the lateral portions of the joint. IX. Carpo-metacarpal Articulations I. Articulation of the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb with THE Trapezium This is a joint of reciprocal reception, and enjoys great freedom of movement, on account of the configuration of its articular surfaces, which are saddle-shaped, so that, on section, each bone appears to be received into a cavity in the other, according to the direction in which they are cut. Its ligaments are a capsular ligament and a synovial membrane. The Capsular Ligament is a thick but loose capsule, which passes from the circumference of the upper extremity of the metacarpal bone to the rough edge bounding the articular surface of the trapezium ; it is thickest externally and behind, and lined by a separate synovial membrane. Movements.—In the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the thumb with the trapezium, the movements permitted are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. When the joint is flexed, the metacarpal bone is brought in front of the palm, and the thumb is gradually turned to the fingers. It is by this335 CARPO-METACARPAL peculiar movement that the tip of the thumb is opposed to the other digits; for, by shghtly flexing the fingers, the palmar surface of the thumb can be brought in contact with their palmar surfaces one after another. 2. Articulations op the Metacarpal Bones of the Four Inner Fingers with the Carpus The joints formed between the carpus and four inner metacarpal bones are arthrodial joints. The ligaments are Dorsal. Palmar. Interosseous. The Dorsal Ligaments, the strongest and most distinct, connect the carpal and metacarpal bones on their dorsal surface. The second metacarpal bone receives two fasciculi, one from the trapezium, the other from the trapezoid ; the third metacarpal receives two, one from the trapezoid, and one from the os magnum ; the fourth two, one from the os magnum and one from the unci- Fig. 251.—Vertical section through the articula- form ; the fifth receives a single showing the five synovial fasciculus from the unciform bone, which is continuous with a similar ligament on the palmar surface, forming an incomplete capsule. The Palmar Ligaments have a somewhat similar arrangement on the palmar surface, with the exception of the third metacar- pal, which has three ligaments, an external one from the trape- zium, situated above the sheath of the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis ; a middle one, from the OS magnum ; and an internal one from the unciform. The Interosseous Ligaments consist of short, thick fibres, which are limited to one part of -the carpo-metacarpal articula- tion ; they connect the contigu- ous inferior angles of the os magnum and unciform with the adjacent surfaces of the third and fourth metacarpal bones. The Synovial Membrane is a continuation of that between the two rows of carpal bones. Occasionally, the articulation of the unciform with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones has a separate synovial membrane. The synovial membranes of the wrist and carpus (fig. 251) are thus seen to be five in number. The first, the membrana sacciformis, passes from the lower end of the ulna to the sigmoid cavity of the radius, and lines the upper surface of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. The second passes from the lower end of the radius and interarticular fibro-cartilage above, to the bones of the first row below. The third, the most extensive, passes between the contiguous margins of the two rows of carpal bones ; between the bones of the second row to the carpal extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones. The fourth, from the margin of the trapezium to the metacarpal bone of the thumb. The fifth, between the adjacent margins of the cuneiform and pisiform bones. Actions.—The movement permitted in the carpo-metacarpal articulations of theARTICULATIONS 336 four inner fingers is limited to a slight gliding of the articular surfaces upon each other, the extent of which varies in the different joints. Thus the articulation of the metacarpal bone of the little finger is most movable, then that of the ring- finger. The metacarpal bones of the index and middle fingers are almost immovable. Articulations of the Metacarpal Bones with each other The carpal extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones articulate with one another at each side by small surfaces covered with cartilage, and connected together by dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal and Palmar Ligaments pass transversely from one bone to another on the dorsal and palmar surfaces. The Interosseous Ligaments pass between their contiguous surfaces, just beneath their lateral articular facets. The Synovial Membrane between the lateral facets is a reflection from that between the two rows of carpal bones. The Transverse Metacarpal Ligament (fig. 252) is a narrow fibrous band, which passes transversely across the anterior surfaces of the digital extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones, con- Fm. 2S2.-Articulations of the phalanges. ff ^^^f ^^^m together. It is ^ blended anteriorly with the anterior (glenoid) ligament of the metacarpo-phalangeal ar- ticulations. To its posterior border is connected the fascia which covers the Interossei muscles. Its superficial sur- face is concave where the flexor tendons pass over it. Beneath it the tendons of the Interossei muscles pass to their insertion. X. Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulations (fig. 252) These articulations are of the condyloid kind, formed by the reception of the rounded head of the metacarpal bone into a superficial cavity in the extremity of the first phalanx. The ligaments are : Anterior. Two Lateral. UATERAl- L Metacarj)o-ph a I a ngea I articulaticii Phalangeal articulations The Anterior Ligaments (Glenoid Ligaments of Cru- veilhier) are thick, dense, fibrous structures, placed on the palmar surface of the joints in the intervals be- tween the lateral ligaments, to which they are connected; they are loosely united to the metacarpal bone, but very firmly to the base of the first phalanges. Their palmar surface is intimately blended with the transverse metacarpal ligament, and presents a groove for the passage of the flexor tendons, the337 HIP-JOINT sheath surrounding which is connected to each side of the groove. By their deep surface, they form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone, and are lined by a synovial membrane. The Lateral Ligaments are strong, rounded cords, placed one on each side of the joint, each being attached by one extremity to the posterior tubercle on the side of the head of the metacarpal bone, and by the other to the contiguous extremity of the phalanx. Actions.—The movements which occur in these joints are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction ; the lateral movements are very limited. Surface Form.—The prominences of the knuckles do not correspond to the position of the joints either of the metacarpo-phalangeal or interphalangeal articulations. These prominences are invariably formed by the distal ends of the proximal bone of each joint, and the line indicating the position of the joint must be sought considerably in front of the middle of the knuckle. The usual rule for finding these joints is to flex the distal phalanx on the proximal one to a right angle; the position of the joint is then indicated by an imaginary line drawn along the middle of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx. XI. Articulations of the Phalanges These are gingiymus joints. The hgaments are :— Anterior. Two Lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those in the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations ; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament. Actions.—The only movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension; these movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The movement of flexion is very considerable, but extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following groups:— 1. The hip-joint. II. The knee-joint. III. The articulations between the tibia and fibula. IV. The ankle-joint. V. The articulations of the tarsus. VI. The tarso-metatarsal articulations. VII. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. VIII. The articulations of the phalanges. I. Hip-Joint (fig. 253) This articulation is an enarthrodial, or ball-and-socket joint, formed by the reception of the head of the femur into the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum. The articulating surfaces are covered with cartilage, that on the head of the femur being thicker at the centre than at the circumference, and covering the entire surface with the exception of a depression just below its centre for the ligamentum teres ; that covering the acetabulum is much thinner at the centre than at the circumference. It forms an incomplete cartilaginous ring, of a horseshoe shape, deficient below and in front, and having in its centre a circular depression, which is occupied in the recent state by a mass of fat, covered by synovial membrane. The ligaments of the joint are the Capsular. Teres. Ilio-femoral. Cotyloid. Transverse. The Capsular Ligament is a strong, dense, ligamentous capsule, embracing the margin of the acetabulum above, and surrounding the neck of the femur below. Its upper circumference is attached to the acetabulum, above and behind, two or three lines external to the cotyloid ligament; but in front, it is attached to the outer margin of this ligament, and opposite to the notch where the margin of this Z338 ARTICULATIONS cavity is deficient, it is connected to the transverse ligament, and by a few fibres to the edge of the obturator foramen. Its loioer circumference surromids the neck of the femur, being attached, in front, to the spiral or anterior intertrochanteric line ; above, to the base of the neck; behind, to the neck of the bone, about half an inch above the posterior intertrochanteric line. From this insertion the fibres are reflected upwards over the neck of the femur, forming a sort of tubular sheath (the cervical reflection), which blends with the periosteum, and can be traced as far as the articular cartilage. It is much thicker at the upper and fore part of the joint, where the greatest amount of resistance is required, than below and internally, where it is thin, loose, and longer than in any other part. It consists of tAvo sets of fibres, circular and longitudinal. The circular fibres are most abundant at the lower and back part of the capsule, while the longitudinal fibres are greatest in amount at the upper and front part of the capsule, where they form distinct bands, or accessory ligaments, of which the most important is the ilio-femoral. The Fig. 253.-—Left hip-joint laid open. other accessory bands are knoAvn as the imho-femoral, passing from the ilio- pectineal eminence to the front of the capsule ; ilio-trochanteric, from the anterior inferior spine of the ilium to the front of the great trochanter ; and iscliio-capsular, passing from the ischium, just below the acetabulum, to blend with the circular fibres at the lower part of the joint. The external surface (fig. 239, page 311) is rough, covered by numerous muscles, and separated in front from the Psoas and Iliacus by a synovial bursa, which not unfrequently communicates, by a circular aperture, with the cavity of the joint. It differs from the capsular Hgament of the shoulder in being much less loose and lax, and in not being perforated for the passage of a tendon. The Ilio-femoral Ligament (figs. 239 and 254) is an accessory band of fibres, extending obhquely across the front of the joint; it is intimately connected with the capsular ligament, and serves to strengthen it in this situation. It is attached, above, to the lower part of the anterior inferior spine of the ilium; and, divergingHIP-JOINT 339 below, forms two bands, of which one passes downwards to be inserted into the lower part of the anterior intertrochanteric line ; the other passes downwards and outwards to be inserted into the upper part of the same line and adjacent part of the neck of the femur. Between the two bands is a thinner part of the capsule. Sometimes there is no division, but the ligament spreads out into a flat, triangular band, which is attached below into the whole length of the anterior intertrochanteric line. This ligament is frequently called the Y-shaped ligament of Bigelow. The Ligamentum Teres is a triangular band implanted by its apex into the depression a little behind and below the centre of the head of the femur, and by its broad base into the margins of the cotyloid notch, becoming blended with the transverse ligament. It is formed of connective tissue, surrounded by a tubular sheath of synovial membrane. Sometimes only the synovial fold exists, or the ligament may be altogether absent. The ligament is made tense when the hip is semiflexed, and the limb then adducted and rotated outwards ; it is, on the other Fig. 254.—Hip-jomt, showing the ilio- Fig. 255.—Vertical section through femoral ligament. (After Bigelow.) hip-joint. (Henle.) V hand, relaxed when the limb is abducted. It has, however, but little influence as a ligament, though it may to a certain extent limit movement, and would appear to be merely a modification of the folds which in other joints fringe the margins of reflection of synovial membranes (see page 288). The Cotyloid Ligament is a fibro-cartilaginous rim attached to the margin of the acetabulum, the cavity of which it deepens ; at the same time it protects the edges of the bone, and fills up the inequalities on its surface. It bridges over the notch as the transverse ligament, and thus forms a complete circle, which closely surrounds the head of the femur, and assists in holding it in its place, acting as a sort of valve. It is prismoid in form, its base being attached to the margin of the acetabulum, and its opposite edge being free and sharp ; whilst its two surfaces are invested by synovial membrane, the external one being in contact with the capsular ligament, the internal one being inclined inwards so as to narrow the acetabulum, and embrace the cartilaginous surface of the head of the femur. It is much thicker above and behind than below and in front, and consists of close z 2ARTICULATIONS 340 compact fibres, which arise from different iDoints of the circmiiference of the acetabukim, and interlace with each other at very acute angles. The Transverse Ligament is in reality a portion of the cotyloid ligament, though differing from it in having no nests of cartilage cells amongst its fibres. It consists of strong, flattened fibres, w^hich cross the notch at the lower part of the acetabulum, and convert it into a foramen. Thus an interval is left beneath the ligament for the passage of nutrient vessels to the joint. The Synovial Membrane is very extensive. Commencing at the margin of the cartilaginous surface of the head of the femur, it covers all that portion of the neck which is contained within the joint; from the neck it is reflected on the internal surface of the capsular ligament, covers both surfaces of the cotyloid ligament and the mass of fat contained in the depression at the bottom of the acetabulum, and Fig. 256.—Eelation of muscles to the capsule of the hip-joint. From a drawing by Mr. F. A. Barton. is prolonged in the form of a tubular sheath around the ligamentum teres, as far as the head of the femur. The muscles in relation with the joint are, in front, the Psoas and Iliacus, separated from the capsular ligament by a synovial bursa ; above, the reflected head of the Rectus and Gluteus minimus, the latter being closely adherent to the capsule ; internally, the Obturator externus and Pectineus ; behind, the Pyriformis, Gemellus superior, Obturator internus. Gemellus inferior. Obturator externus, and Quadratus femoris (fig. 256). The arteries supplying the joint are derived from the obturator, sciatic, internal circumflex, and gluteal. The nerves are articular branches from the sacral plexus, great sciatic, obtu- rator, accessory obturator, and a filament from the branch of the anterior crural supplying the Rectus. Actions.—The movements of the hip, like those of all enarthrodial joints, are very extensive ; they are, flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. The hip-joint presents a very striking contrast to the other great enarthrodialHIP-JOINT 341 joint—the shoulder—in the much more complete mechanical arrangements for its security and for the limitation of its movements. In the shoulder, as we have seen, the head of the humerus is not adapted at all in shape to the glenoid cavity, and is hardly restrained in any of its ordinary movements by the capsular ligament. In the hip-joint, on the contrary, the head of the femur is closely fitted to the aceta- bulum for a distance extending over nearly half a sphere, and at the margin of the bony cup it is still more closely embraced by the ligamentous ring of the cotyloid ligament, so that the head of the femur is held in its place by that ligament even when the fibres of the capsule have been quite divided (Humphry). The anterior portion of the capsule, described as the ilio-femoral or accessory ligament, is the strongest of all the ligaments in the body, and is put on the stretch by any attempt to "extend the femur beyond a straight line with the trunk. That is to say, this ligament is the chief agent in maintaining the erect position without muscular fatigue, the action of the extensor muscles of the buttock being balanced by the tension of the ilio-femoral and capsular ligaments. The security of the joint may be also provided for by the two bones being directly united through the ligamentum teres ; but it is doubtful whether this so-called ligament can have much influence upon the mechanism of the joint. Flexion of the hip-joint is arrested by the soft parts of the thigh and abdomen being brought into contact; * extension by the tension of the ilio-femoral ligament and front of the capsule ; adduction by the thighs coming into contact; adduction with flexion by the outer band of the ilio-femoral ligament, the ilio-trochanteric ligament, the outer part of the capsular ligament; abduction by the inner band of the ilio-femoral ligament and the pubo-femoral band ; rotation outwards by the outer band of the ilio-femoral ligament; and rotation inwards by the ischio-capsular ligament and the hinder part of the capsule. The muscles which flex the femur on the pelvis are, the Psoas, Iliacus, Kectus, Sartorius, Pectineus, Adductor longus and brevis, and the anterior fibres of the Gluteus medius and minimus. Extension is mainly performed by the Gluteus maximus, assisted by the hamstring muscles. The thigh is adducted by the Adductor magnus, longus and brevis, the Pectineus, and Gracilis, and abducted, by the Gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus. The muscles which rotate the thigh inward are the anterior fibres of the Gluteus medius, the Gluteus minimus, and the Tensor vaginae femoris; while those which rotate it outioards are the posterior fibres of the Gluteus melius, the Pyriformis, Obturator externus and internus, Gemellus superior and inferior, Quadratus femoris, Psoas, Iliacus, Gluteus maximus, the three Adductors, the Pectineus, and the Sartorius. Surface Form.—A line drawn from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the most prominent part of the tuberosity of the ischium (Nelaton's line) runs through the centre of the acetabulum, and would, therefore, indicate the level of the hip-joint ; or, in other words, the upper border of the great trochanter, which lies on Nelaton's line, is on a level with the centre of the hip-joint. Surgical Anatoiny.—In dislocation of the hip, ' the head of the thigh-bone may rest at any point around its socket' (Bryant); but whatever position the head ultimately assumes, the primary displacement is generally downwards and inwards, the capsule giving way at its weakest—that is, its lower and inner—part. The situation that the head of the bone subsequently assumes is determined by the degree of flexion or extension, and of outward or inward rotation of the thigh at the moment of luxation, influenced, no doubt, by the ilio-femoral ligament, which is not easily ruptured. When, for instance, the head is forced backwards, this ligament forms a fixed axis, round which the head of the bone rotates, and is thus driven on to the dorsum of the ilium. The ilio-femoral ligament also influences the position of the thigh in the various dislocations : in the dislocations backwards it is tense, and produces inversion of the limb ; in the dislocation on to the pubes, it is relaxed, and therefore allows the external rotators to evert the thigh ; while in the thyroid disloca- tion it is tense, and produces flexion. The muscles inserted into the upper part of the femur, with the exception of the Obturator internus, have yerj little direct influence in determining the position of the bone. But Bigelow has endeavoured to show that the * The hip-joint cannot be completely flexed, in most persons, without at the same time flexing the knee, on account of the shortness of the hamstring muscles.—-Cleland, Journ. of Anat. and PJiys. No. I. Old Series, p. 87.342 AETICULATIONS Obturator internns is the principal agent in determining whether, in the backward disloca- tions, the head of the bone shall be ultimately lodged on the dorsum of the ilium, or in or near the sciatic notch. In both dislocations the head passes, in the first instance, in the same direction ; but, as Bigelow asserts, in the displacement on to the dorsum, the head of the bone travels up behind the acetabulum, between the muscle and the pelvis; while in the dislocation into the sciatic notch, the head passes behind the muscle, and is therefore prevented from reaching the dorsum, in consequence of the tendon of the muscle arching over the neck of the bone, and so remains in the neighbourhood of the sciatic notch. Bigelow, therefore, distinguishes these two forms of dislocation by describing them as dislocations backwards,' above and below,' the Obturator internus. The ilio-femoral ligament is rarely torn in dislocations of the hip, and this fact is taken advantage of by the surgeon in reducing these dislocations by manipulation. It is made to act as a fulcrum to a lever, of which the long arm is the shaft of the femur, and the short arm the neck of the bone. The hip-joint is rarely the seat of acute synovitis from injury, on account of its deep position and its thick covering of soft parts. Acute inflammation may, and does, frequently occur as the result of constitutional conditions, as rheumatism, pyaemia, &c. When, in these cases, effusion takes place, and the joint becomes distended with fluid, the swelling is not very easy to detect on account of the thickness of the capsule and the depth of the articulation. It is principally to be found on the front of the joint, just mternal to the ilio-femoral ligament; or behind, at the lower and back part. In these two x^laces the capsule is thinner than elsewhere. Disease of the hip-joint is much more frequently of a chronic character and is usually of a tubercular origin. It begms either in the bones or in the synovial membrane. More frequently in the former, and probably, in most cases, at the growing, highly vascular tissue in the neighbourhood of the epiphysial cartilage. In this respect it differs very materially from tubercular arthritis of the knee, where the disease usually commences in the synovial membrane. The reasons for this are two-fold : first, this part being the centre of rapid growth, its nutrition is unstable and apt to pass into inflammatory action ; and, secondly, great strain is thrown upon it, from the frequency of falls and blows upon the hip, which causes crushing of the epiphysial cartilage or the cancellous tissue in its neighbourhood, with the results likely to follow such an injury. In addition to these, the depth of the joint protects it from the causes of synovitis. In chronic hip-disease the affected limb assumes an altered position, the cause of which it is important to understand. In the early stage of a typical case, the limb is flexed, abducted, and rotated outwards. In this position all the ligaments of the joint are relaxed : the front of the capsule by flexion ; the outer band of the ilio-femoral ligament by abduction ; and the inner band of this ligament and the back of the capsule by rotation outwards. It is, therefore, the position of greatest ease. The condition is not quite obvious at first, upon examining a patient. If the patient is laid in the supine position, the affected limb will be found to be extended and parallel with the other. But it will be found that the pelvis is tilted downwards on the diseased side and the limb apparently longer than its fellow, and that the lumbar spine is arched forward (lordosis). If now the thigh is abducted and flexed, the tilting downwards and the arching forwards of the pelvis disappears. The condition is thus explained. A limb which is flexed and abducted is obviously useless for progression, and, in order to overcome the difficulty, the patient depresses the affected side of his pelvis in order to produce parallelism of his limbs, and at the same time rotates his pelvis on its transverse horizontal axis, so as to direct the limb downwards, instead of forwards. In the later stages of the disease the limb becomes flexed and adducted and inverted. This position probably depends upon muscular action, at all events as regards the adduction. The Adductor muscles are supplied by the obturator nerve, which also largely supplies the joint. These muscles are therefore thrown into reflex action by the irritation of the peripheral terminations of this nerve in the inflamed articulation. Osteo-arthritis is not uncommon in the hip-joint, and is said to be more common in the male than in the female, in whom the knee-joint is more frequently affected. It is a disease of middle age or more advanced period of life. Congenital dislocation is more commonly met with in the hip-joint than in any other articulation. The displacement usually takes place on to the dorsum ilii. It gives rise to extreme lordosis, and a waddling gait is noticed as soon as the child commences to walk. Excision of the hip may be required for disease or for injury, especially gunshot. It may be performed either by an anterior incision or a posterior one. The former one entails less interference with important structures, especially muscles, than the posterior one, but permits of less efficient drainage. In these days, however, when the surgeon aims at securing healing of his wound without suppuration, this second desideratum is not of so much importance. In the operation in front, the surgeon makes an incision three to four inches in length, starting immediately below and external to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, downwards and inwards between the Sartorius and Tensor vaginae femoris, to the neck of the bone, dividing the capsule at its upper part. A narrow bladed saw now divides the neck of the femur, and the head of the bone is extracted with sequestrum forceps. All diseased tissue is carefully removed with a sharp spoon or scissors, and the cavity thoroughly flushed out with a hot antiseptic fluid. The posterior method consists in making an incision three or four inches long, com-343 KNEE-JOINT mencing midway between the top of the great trochanter and the anterior superior spine, and ending over the shaft, just below the trochanter. The muscles are detached from the great trochanter, and the capsule opened freely. The head and neck are freed from the soft parts and the bone sawn through just below the top of the trochanter with a narrow saw. The head of the bone is then levered out of the acetabulum. In both operations, if the acetabulum is eroded, it must be freely gouged. II. Knee-Joint The knee-joint was formerly described as a gingiymns or hinge-joint, but is really of a much more complicated character. It must be regarded as consisting of three articulations together: one between each condyle of the femur and the Fig. 257.—Eight knee-joint. Anterior Fig. 258.—Eight knee-joint. Posterior view. view. corresponding tuberosity of the tibia, which are condyloid joints, and one between the patella and the femur, which is partly arthrodial, but not completely so, since the articular surfaces are not mutually adapted to each other, so that the movement is not a simple gliding one. This view of the construction of the knee-joint receives confirmation from the study of the articulation in some of the lower mammals, where three synovial membranes are sometimes found, corresponding to these three subdivisions, either entirely distinct or only connected together by small communi- cations. This view is further rendered probable by the existence of the two crucial ligaments within the joint, which must be regarded as the external and internal lateral ligaments of the inner and outer joints respectively. The existence of the ligamentum mucosum would further indicate a tendency to separation of the synovial cavity into two minor sacs, one corresponding to each joint. The bones entering into the formation of the knee-joint are the condyles of the femur above, the head of the tibia below, and the patella in front. The bones are344 AKTICULATIONS connected together by ligaments, some of which are placed on the exterior of the joint, while others occupy its interior. The Anterior Ligament, or Ligamentum Patellae (fig. 257), is the central portion of the common tendon of the Extensor muscles of the thigh which is continued from the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, supplying the place of an anterior ligament. It is a strong, flat, ligamentous band, about three inches in length, attached, above, to the apex of the patella and the rough depression on its posterior surface ; below, to the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia ; its superficial fibres being continuous over the front of the patella with those of the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor. The lateral portions of the tendon of the Extensor muscles pass down on either side of the patella, attached to the borders of this bone and its ligament, to be inserted into the upper extremity of the tibia on each side of the tubercle; externally, these portions merge into the capsular ligament. They are termed lateral loatellar ligaments. The posterior surface of the ligamentum patellae can usually be easily separated from the front of the capsular ligament. The Posterior Ligament (Ligamentum Posticum Winslowii) (fig. 258) is a broad, flat, fibrous band, formed of fasciculi, obliquely directed, and separated from one another by apertures for the passage of vessels and nerves. The strongest of these fasciculi is derived from the tendon of the Semi-membranosus, and passes from the back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia obliquely upwards and outwards to the back part of the outer condyle of the femur. The posterior ligament forms part of the floor of the popliteal space, and the popliteal artery rests upon it. The Internal Lateral Ligament is a broad, flat, membranous band, thicker behind than in front, and situated nearer to the back than the front of the joint. It is attached, above, to the inner tuberosity of the femur ; below, to the inner tuberosity and inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, to the extent of about two inches. It is crossed, at its lower part, by the tendons of the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semi-tendinosus muscles, a synovial bursa being interposed. Its deep surface covers the anterior portion of the tendon of the Semi-membranosus, the synovial membrane of the joint, and the inferior internal articular vessels and nerve ; it is intimately adherent to the internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. The Long External Lateral Ligament is a strofig, rounded, fibrous cord, situated nearer to the back than the front of the joint. It is attached, above, to the back part of the outer tuberosity of the femur; below, to the outer part of the head of the fibula. Its outer surface is covered by the tendon of the Biceps, which divides at its insertion into two parts, separated by the ligament. The ligament has passing beneath it, the tendon of the Popliteus muscle, and the inferior external articular vessels and nerve. The Short External Lateral Ligament is an accessory bundle of fibres placed behind and parallel with the preceding, attached, above, to the lower and back part of the outer tuberosity of the femur; below, to the summit of the styloid process of the fibula. This ligament is intimately connected with the capsular hgament, and has, passing beneath it, the tendon of the Pophteus muscle, and the inferior external articular vessels and nerve. The Capsular Ligament consists of an exceedingly thin, but strong, fibrous membrane, which fills in the intervals left between the stronger bands above described, and is inseparably connected with them. In front it blends with the External Ligaments Anterior, or Ligamentum Pa- Interior Ligaments ticum Winslowii. Internal Lateral. Two External Lateral. Capsular. tellfe.

Sliowino: lateral patellar ligaments and fills in the interval between the anterior and lateral ligaments of the joint, with which latter structures it is closely connected. Behind, it is strong, and formed chiefly of vertical fibres, which arise above from the condyles and intercondyloid notch of the femur, and is connected below with the back part of the head of the tibia, being closely united with the origins of the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, and Popliteus muscles. It passes in front of, but is inseparably connected with, the posterior ligament. The Crucial are two interosseous liga- ments of considerable strength, situated in the interior of the joint, nearer its posterior than its anterior part. They are called crucial because they cross each other somewhat like the lines of the letter X ; and have received the names anterior and ])Osterior, from the position of their attachment to the tibia. The Anterior, or External Crucial Ligament (fig. 259), is attached to the depression in front of the spine of the tibia, being blended with the anterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro- cartilage, and passing obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards, is inserted into the inner and back part of the outer condyle of the femur. Its direction is upwards, backwards, and outwards. The Posterior, or Internal Crucial Ligament is stronger, but shorter and less oblique in its direction, than the anterior. It is attached to the back part of the de- pression behind the spine of the tibia, to the popliteal notch, and to the posterior extremity of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage ; and passes upwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the outer and fore part of the inner condyle of the femur. As it crosses the anterior crucial liga- Fig. 260,—Head of tibia, with semilunar cartilages, etc. ment, a fasciculus is Seen from above. Eight side, given off from it, which blends with the poste- rior part of that liga- ment. It is in relation, in front, with the ante- rior crucial ligament; behind, with the capsu- lar ligament. The Semilunar Fibro-cartilages (fig. 260) are two crescentic lamellae, which serve to deepen the surface of the head of the tibia, for articulation with the condyles of the femur. The circumference of each cartilage is thick, convex, and attached to the inside of the capsule of the knee ; the inner border is thin, concave, and free. Their upper surfaces are concave,ARTICULATIONS 346 and in relation with the condyles of the femur; their lower surfaces are flat, and rest upon the head of the tibia. Each cartilage covers nearly the outer two-thirds of the corresponding articular surface of the tibia, leaving the inner third uncovered ; both surfaces are smooth, and invested by synovial membrane. The Internal Semilunar Fibro-cartilage is nearly semicircular in form, a little elongated from before backwards, and broader behind than in front; its anterior extremity, thin and pointed, is attached to a depression on the anterior margin of the head of the tibia, in front of the anterior crucial ligament; its posterior extremity is attached to the depression behind the spine, between the attach- ^ T ^- 1 ^- ^-u 1,^1 -m rxi ments of the external IiG. 201.—Longitudinal section through the middle of the right knee-joint. (After Braune.) semilunar fibro-carti- lage and the posterior crucial ligaments. The External Semi- lunar Fibr,o-cartilage forms nearly an entire circle, covering a larger portion of the articular surface than the internal one. It is grooved on its outer side for the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. Its extremities, at. their insertion, are interposed between the two extremities of the in- ternal semilunar fibro- cartilage ; the anterior extremity being attached in front of the spine of the tibia to the outer side of, and behind, the" anterior crucial liga- ment, with which it blends; the posterior ex- tremity being attached behind the spine of the tibia, in front of the posterior extremity of the internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. Just before its insertion pos- teriorly it gives off a strong fasciculus, which passes obliquely up- wards and outwards, to be inserted into the inner condyle of the femur, close to the attachment of the posterior crucial ligament. Occasionally a small fasciculus is given off, which passes forwards to be inserted into the back part of the anterior crucial ligament. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage gives off from its anterior oonvex margin a fasciculus, which forms the transverse ligament. The Transverse Ligament is a band of fibres which passes transversely from the anterior convex margin of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage to the anterior convex margin of the internal semilunar fibro-cartilage; its thick- ness varies considerably in different subjects, and it is sometimes absent altogether. The Coronary Ligaments are merely portions of the capsular ligament, whichKNEE-JOINT 347 connect the circumference of each of the semikmar fibro-cartilages with the margin of the head of the tibia. The Synovial Membrane of the knee-joint is the largest and most extensive in the body. Commencing at the upper border of the patella, it forms a short cul-de- sac beneath the Quadriceps extensor tendon of the thigh, on the lower part of the front of the shaft of the femur: this communicates with a synovial bursa inter- posed between the tendon and the front of the femur, by an orifice of variable size. On each side of the patella, the synovial membrane extends beneath the aponeurosis of the Vasti muscles, and more especially beneath that of the Vastus internus. Below the patella, it is separated from the anterior ligament by the anterior part of the capsule and a considerable quantity of adipose tissue. In this situation it sends off a triangular prolongation, containing a few ligamentous fibres, which extends from the anterior part of the joint below the patella, to the front of the intercondyloid notch. This fold has been termed the ligamentimi mucosiim. It also sends off two fringe-like folds, called the ligamenta alaria, which extend from the sides of the ligamentum mucosum, upwards and laterally between the patella and femur. On either side of the joint, it passes downwards from the femur, lining the capsule to its point of attachment to the semilunar cartilages; it may then be traced over the upper surfaces of these cartilages to their free borders, and from thence along their under surfaces to the tibia. At the back part of the external one it forms a cul-de-sac between the groove on its surface and the tendon of the Popliteus; it surrounds the crucial ligaments, and lines the inner surface of the ligaments which enclose the joints. The pouch of synovial membrane between the Extensor tendon and front of the femur is supported, during the movements of the knee, by a small muscle, the Subcrureus, which is inserted into the upper part of the capsular ligament. The folds of synovial membrane and the fatty processes contained in them act, as it seems, mainly as padding to fill up interspaces and obviate concussions. Sometimes the bursa beneath the Quadriceps extensor is completely shut off from the rest of the synovial cavity, thus forming a closed sac between the Quadriceps and the lower part of the front of the femur; or it may communicate with the synovial cavity by a minute aperture. The bursas about the knee-joint are the following :— In front there are three burs^e : one is interposed between the patella and the skin; another of small size between the upper part of the tuberosity of the tibia and the ligamentum patellae ; and a third between the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia and the skin. On the outer side there are four burs^e : (i) one beneath the outer head of the Gastrocnemius (which sometimes communicates with the joint); (2) one above the external lateral ligament between it and the tendon of the Biceps; (3) one beneath the external lateral ligament between it and the tendon of the Popliteus (this is sometimes only an expansion from the next bursa); (4) one beneath the tendon of the Popliteus between it and the condyle of the femur, which is almost always an extension from the synovial membrane. On the inner side there are five burs« : (i) one beneath the inner head of the Gastrocnemius, which sends a prolongation between the tendons of the Gastro- cnemius and Semimembranosus. This bursa often communicates with the joint; (2) one above the internal lateral ligament between it and the tendons of the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semitendinosus ; (3) one beneath the internal lateral ligament between it and the tendon of the Semimembranosus (this is sometimes only an expansion from the next bursa) ; (4) one beneath the tendon of the Semimembranosus, between it and the head of the tibia ; (5) sometimes there is a bursa between the tendons of the Semimembranosus and of the Semitendinosus. Structures around the Joint.—In front and at the sides, the Quadriceps extensor; on the outer side, the tendons of the Biceps and the Popliteus and the external popliteal nerve ; on the inner side, the Sartorius, Gracilis, Semi- tendinosus and Semimembranosus ; behind, an expansion from the tendon of348 ARTICULATIONS the Semimembranosus, the popUteal vessels, and the internal popliteal nerve, Popliteus, Plantaris, and inner and outer heads of the Gastrocnemius, some lymphatic glands, and fat. The Arteries supplying the joint are derived from the anastomotica magna branch of the femoral, articular branches of the popliteal, anterior and posterior recurrent branches of the anterior tibial, and descending branch from the external circumflex of the Profunda. The Nerves are derived from the obturator, anterior crural, and external and internal popliteal. Actions.—The knee-joint permits of movements of flexion and extension, and, in certain positions, of slight rotation inwards and outwards. The movement of flexion and extension does not, however, take place in a simple, hinge-like manner, as in other joints, but is a complicated movement, consisting'of a certain amount of gliding and rotation; so that the same part of one articular surface is not always applied to the same part of the other articular surface, and the axis of motion is not a fixed one. If the joint is examined while in a condition of extreme flexion, the posterior part of the articular surfaces Fig". 262. View of the ^^le tibia will be found to be in contact with the posterior posterior surface of the rounded extremities of the condyles of the femur ; and patella. Showing dia- if a simple hinge-like movement were to take place, the grammatically the areas ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ revolving movement of the tibia of contact with the i^ i. • xu 1 1 ^ f i i femur in different posi- occurs, would be m the back part 01 the condyle. It tions of the knee. the leg is now brought forwards into a position of semi- flexion, the upper surface of the tibia will be seen to glide over the condyles of the femur, so that the middle part of the articular facets are in contact, and the axis of rotation must therefore have shifted forwards to nearer the centre of the condyles. If the leg is now brought into the extended position, a still further gliding takes place and a further shifting forwards of the axis of rotation. This is not, however, a simple movement, but is accompanied by a certain amount of rotation outwards round a vertical axis drawn through the centre of the head of the tibia. This rotation is due to the greater length of the internal condyle and to the fact that the anterior portion of its articular surface is inclined obliquely outwards. In consequence of this, it will be seen that towards the close of the movement of extension, that is to say, just before complete extension is effected, the tibia glides obliquely upwards and outwards over this oblique surface on the inner condyle, and the leg is therefore necessarily rotated outwards. In flexion of the joint the converse of these move- ments takes place : the tibia glides backwards round the end of the femur, and at the commencement of the movement the tibia is directed downwards and inwards along the oblique curve of the inner condyle, thus causing an inward rotation to the leg. During flexion and extension, the patella moves on the lower end of the femur, but this movement is not a simple gliding one ; for if the articular surface of this bone is examined, it will be found to present on each side of the central vertical ridge two less marked transverse ridges, which divide the surface, except a small portion along the inner border, which is cut off by a slight vertical ridge into six facets (see fig. 262), and therefore does not present a uniform curved surface, as would be the case if a simple gliding movement took place. These six facets—three on each side of the median vertical ridge—correspond to and denote the parts of the bone respectively in contact with the condyles of the femur during flexion, semi-flexion, and extension. In flexion, only the upper facets on the patella are in contact with the condyles of the femur; the lower two-thirds of the bone rests upon the mass of fat which occupies the space between the femur and tibia. In the semi-flexed position of the joint, the middle facets on the patella rest uponKNEE-JOINT 349 the most prominent portion of the condyles, and thus afford greater leverage to the Quadriceps by increasing its distance from the centre of motion. In complete extension the patella is drawn up so that only the lower facets are in contact with the articular surfaces of the condyles. The narrow strip along the inner border is an exception to this, and would appear to be in contact with the internal condyle throughout its whole extent, in every position of the joint. As in the elbow, so it is in the knee—the axis of rotation in flexion and extension is not precisely at right angles to the axis of the bone, but during flexion there is a certain amount of alteration of plane ; so that, whereas in flexion the femur and tibia are in the same plane, in extension the one bone forms an angle of about ten degrees with the other. There is, however, this difference between the two extremities—that in the upper, during extension, the humeri are parallel, and the bones of the forearm diverge; in the lower, the femora converge below, and the tibiae are parallel. In addition to the slight rotation during flexion and extension, the tibia enjoys an independent rotation on the condyles of the femur, in certain positions of the joint. This movement takes place between the interarticular fibro-cartilages and the tibia, whereas the movement of flexion and extension takes place between the interarticular fibro-cartilages and the femur. So that the knee may be said to consist of two joints, separated by the fibro-cartilages : an upper (menisco-femoral), in which flexion and extension take place ; and a lower (menisco-tibial), allowing of a certain amount of rotation. This latter movement can only take place in the semiflexed position of the limb, when all the ligaments are relaxed. During flexion the ligamentum patellae is put upon the stretch, as is also the posterior crucial ligament in extreme flexion. The other ligaments are all relaxed by flexion of the joint, though the relaxation of the anterior crucial ligament is very trifling. Flexion is only checked during life by the contact of the leg with the thigh. In extension the ligamentum patellae becomes relaxed, and, in extreme extension, completely so, so as to allow free lateral movement to the patella, which then rests on the front of the lower end of the femur. The other ligaments, with the exception of the posterior crucial, which is partly relaxed, are all on the stretch. When the limb has been brought into a straight line, extension is checked mainly by the tension of all the ligaments except the posterior crucial and ligamentum patellae. The movements of rotation, of which the knee is capable, are permitted in the semi-flexed condition by the partial relaxation of both crucial ligaments, as well as the lateral ligaments. Rotation inwards appears to be limited by the tension of the anterior crucia ] ligament, and by the interlocking of the two liga- ments ; but rotation outwards does not appear to be checked by either crucial ligament, since they uncross during the execution of this movement, but by the lateral ligaments, especially the internal. The main function of the crucial liga- ments is to act as a direct bond of union between the tibia and femur, preventing the former bone from being carried too far backwards or forwards. Thus the anterior crucial ligament prevents the tibia being carried too far forwards by the extensor tendons, and the posterior crucial checks too great movement backwards by the flexors. They also assist the lateral ligaments in resisting any lateral bending of the joint. The interarticular cartilages are intended, as it seems, to adapt the surface of the tibia to the shape of the femur to a certain extent, so as to fill up the intervals which would otherwise be left in the varying positions of the joint, and to interrupt the jars which would be so frequently transmitted up the limb in jumping or falls on the feet; also to permit of the two varieties of motion, flexion and extension, and rotation, as explained above. The patella is a great defence to the knee-joint from any injury inflicted in front, and it distributes upon a large and tolerably even surface during kneeling the pressure which would otherwise fall upon the prominent ridges of the condyles ; it also affords leverage to the Quadriceps extensor muscle to act upon the tibia, and Mr. Ward has pointed out * how this leverage varies in the various positions of the * Humcm Osteology, p. 405.AETICULATIONS 35° joint, so that the action of the muscle produces velocity at the expense of force in the commencement of extension, and, on the contrary, at the close of extension tends to diminish velocity, and therefore the shock to the ligaments; whilst in the standing position it draws the tihia powerfully forwards, and thus maintains it in its place. Extension of the leg on the thigh is performed by the Quadriceps extensor. Flexion by the hamstring muscles, assisted by the Gracilis and Sartorius, and, indirectly, by the Gastrocnemius, Popliteus, and Plantaris. Botation outtvards by the Biceps, and rotation imvards by the Popliteus, Semitendinosus, and, to a slight extent, the Semimembranosus, the Sartorius, and the Gracilis. Surface Form.—The interval between the two bones entering into the formation of the knee-joint can always easily be felt. If the limb is extended, it is situated on a slightly higher level than the apex of the patella ; but if the limb is slightly flexed, a knife carried horizontally backwards immediately below the apex of the patella v/ould pass directly into the joint. When the knee-joint is distended with fluid, the outline of the synovial membrane at the front of the knee may be fairly well mapped out. Surgical Anatomy.—From a consideration of the construction of the knee-joint, it would at first sight appear to be one of the least secure of any of the joints in the body. It is formed between the two longest bones, and therefore the amount of leverage which can be brought to bear upon it is very considerable ; the articular surfaces are but ill-adapted to each other, and the range and variety of motion which it enjoys is great. All these cir- cumstances tend to render the articulation very insecure ; but, nevertheless, on account of the very powerful ligaments which bind the bones together, the joint is one of the strongest in the body, and dislocation from traumatism is of very rare occurrence. When, on the other hand, the ligaments have been softened or destroyed by disease, partial displacement is very liable to occur, and is frequently brought about by the mere action of the muscles displacing the articular surfaces from each other. The tibia may be dislocated in any direction from the femur—forwards, backwards, inwards, or outwards ; or a combination of two of these dislocations may occur—that is, the tibia may be dislocated forwards and laterally', or backwards and laterally; and any of these dislocations may be complete or incomplete. As a rule, however, the antero-posterior dislocations are complete, the lateral ones incomplete. One or other of the semilunar cartilages may become displaced and nipped between the femur and tibia. The accident is produced by a twist of the leg when the knee is flexed, and is accompanied by a sudden pain and fixation of the knee in a flexed position. The cartilage may be displaced either inwards or outwards : that is to say, either inwards towards the tibial spine, so that the cartilage becomes lodged in the intercondyloid notch; or outwards, so that the cartilage projects beyond the margin of the two articulating bones. Acute synovitis, the result of traumatism or exposure to cold, is very common in the knee, on account of its superficial position. When distended with fluid, the swelling shows itself above and at the sides of the patella, reaching about an inch or more above the trochlear surface of the femur, and extending a little higher under the Vastus internus than the Vastus externus. Occasionally the swelling may extend two inches or more. At the sides of the patella the swelling extends lower at the inner side than it does on the outer side. The lower level of the synovial membrane is just above the level of the upper part of the head of the fibula. In the middle line it covers the upper third of the ligamentum patellfe, being separated from it, however, hj the capsule and a little fat. Chronic synovitis principally shows itself in the form of pulpy degeneration of the synovial membrane, leading to tubercular arthritis. The reasons why tubercular disease of the knee usually com- mences in the synovial membrane appear to be the complex and extensive nature of this sac ; the extensive vascular supply to it; and the fact that injuries are generally diffused and applied to the front of the joint rather than to the ends of the bones. Syphilitic disease not unfrequently attacks the knee-joint. In the hereditary form of the disease ii is usually synmietrical, attacking both joints, which become filled with synovial eflusion, and is very intractable and difficult of cure. In the tertiary form of the disease, gumma- tous infiltration of the synovial membrane may take place. The knee is one of the joints most commonly affected with osteo-arthritis, and is said to be more frequently the seat of this disease in women than in men. The occurrence of the so-called loose cartilage is almost confined to the knee, though they are occasionally met with in the elbow, and, rarely, in some other joints. Many of them occur in cases of osteo-arthritis, in which calcareous or cartilaginous material is formed in one of the synovial fringes and constitutes the foreign body, and may or may not become detached, in the former case only meriting the usual term, ' loose ' cartilage. In other cases they have their origin in the exudation of inflammatory lymph, and possibly, in some rare instances, a portion of the articular cartilage or one of the semihmar cartilages becomes detached and constitutes the foreign body. Genu valgum, or knock knee, is a common deformity of childhood, in which, owing to changes in and about the joint, the angle between the outer border of the tibia and femur351 TIBIO FIBULAR JOINTS is diminished, so that as the patient stands the two internal condyles of the femora are in contact, but the two internal malleoli of the tibiae are more or less widely separated from each other. When, however, the knees are flexed to a right angle, the two legs are practically parallel with each other. At the commencement of the disease there is a 3aelding of the internal lateral ligament and other fibrous structures on the inner side of the joint; as a result of this there is a constant undue pressm-e of the outer tuberosity of the tibia against the outer condyle of the femur. This extra pressure causes arrest of growth and, possibly, wasting of the outer condyle, and a consequent tendency for the tibia to become separated from the internal condyle. To prevent this the internal condyle becomes depressed; probably, as was first pointed out by Mikulicz, by an increased growth of the lower end of the diaphysis on its inner side, so that the line of the epiphysis becomes oblique instead of transverse to the axis of the bone, with a direction downwards and inwards. Excision of the knee-joint is most frequently required for tubercular disease of this articulation, but is also practised in cases of disorganisation of the knee after rheumatic fever, p_yaemia, Slc, in osteo-arthritis, and in ankylosis. It is also occasionally called for in cases of injury, gunshot or otherwise. The operation is best performed either by a horseshoe incision, starting from one condyle, descending as low as the tubercle of the tibia, where it crosses the leg, and is then carried upward to the other condyle ; or by a transverse incision across the patella. In this latter incision the patella is either removed or sawn across, and the halves subsequently sutured together. The bones having been cleared, and in those cases where the operation is performed for tubercular disease, all pulpy tissue having been carefully removed, the section of the femur is first made. This vshouid never include, in children, more than, at the most, two-thirds of the articular surface, otherwise the epiphysis will be included, with disastrous results as far as regards the growth of the limb. Afterwards a thin slice should be removed from the upper end of the tibia, not more than half an inch. If any diseased tissue still appears to be left in the bones, it should be removed with the gouge, rather than that a further section of the bones should be made. III. Articulations between the Tibia and Fibula The articulations between the tibia and fibula are effected by ligaments which connect both extremities, as well as the shafts of the bones. They may, conse- quently, be subdivided into three sets:—i. The Superior Tibio-fibular articula- tion. 2. The Middle Tibio-fibular ligament or interosseous membrane. 3. The Inferior Tibio-fibular articulation. I. SuPEEioE Tibio-fibular Articulation This articulation is an arthrodial joint. The contiguous surfaces of the bones present two flat, oval facets covered with cartilage, and connected together by the following ligaments :— Anterior Superior Tibio-fibular. Posterior Superior Tibio-fibular. The Anterior Superior Ligament (fig. 259) consists of two or three broad and flat bands, which pass obliquely upwards and inwards from the front of the head of the fibula to the front of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. The Posterior Superior Ligament (fig. 258) is a single thick and broad band, which passes upwards and inwards from the back part of the head of the fibula to the back part of the outer tuberosity of the tibia. It is covered by the tendon of the Popliteus muscle. A Synovial Membrane lines this articulation, which at its upper and back part is occasionally continuous with that of the knee-joint. 2. Middle Tibio-fibular Ligament or Interosseous Membrane An interosseous membrane extends between the contiguous margins of the tibia and fibula, and separates the muscles on the front from those on the back of the leg. It consists of a thin, aponeurotic lamina composed of oblique fibres, which pass downwards and outwards between the interosseous ridges on the two bones. It is broader above than below. Above its upper border is a large, oval aperture for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels forwards to the anterior aspectAETICULATIONS 352 of the leg; and at its lower part an opening for the passage of the anterior pero- neal vessels. It is continuous below with the inferior interosseous ligament; and is perforated in numerous parts for the passage of small vessels. It is in relation, in front, wdth the Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor proprius hallucis, Peroneus tertius, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve; behind, with the Tibialis posticus and Flexor longus hallucis. 3. Inferior Tibio-fibular Articulation This articulation is formed by the rough, convex surface of the inner side of the lower end of the fibula, connected with a concave rough surface on the outer side of the tibia. Below, to the extent of about two lines, these surfaces are smooth, and covered with cartilage, which is continuous with that of the ankle-joint. The ligaments of this joint are :— Anterior Inferior Tibio-fibular. Transverse. Posterior Inferior Tibio-fibular. Inferior Interosseous. The Anterior Inferior Ligament (fig. 264) is a flat, triangular band of fibres, broader below than above, which extends obliquely downwards and outwards between the adjacent margins of the tibia and fibula, on the front aspect of the articulation. It is in relation, in front, with the Peroneus tertius, the aponeurosis of the leg, and the integument; behind, with the inferior interosseous ligament; and lies in contact with the cartilage covering the astragalus. The Posterior Inferior Ligament, smaller than the preceding, is disposed in a similar manner on the posterior surface of the articulation. The Transverse Ligament is a long, narrow band, continuous with the preceding, passing transversely across the back of the joint, from the external malleolus to the posterior border of the articular surface of the tibia, almost as far as its malleolar process. This ligament projects below the margin of the bones, and forms part of the articulating surface for the astragalus. The Inferior Interosseous Ligament consists of numerous short, strong, fibrous bands, which pass between the contiguous rough surfaces of the tibia and fibula, and constitute the chief bond of union between the bones. This ligament is continuous, above, with the interosseous membrane. The Synovial Membrane lining the articular surface is derived from that of the ankle-joint. Actions.—The movement permitted in these articulations is limited to a very slight gliding of the articular surfaces one upon another. IV. Ankle-Joint The Ankle is a ginglymus, or hinge-joint. The bones entering into its form- ation are the lower extremity of the tibia and its malleolus, and the external malleolus of the fibula. These bones are united above, and form a mortise, to receive the upper convex surface of the astragalus and its two lateral facets. The bony surfaces are covered with cartilage, and connected together by a capsule, which in places forms thickened bands constituting the following ligaments :— Anterior. Internal Lateral. Posterior. External Lateral. The Anterior Tibio-tarsal Ligament (fig. 263) is a broad, thin, membranous layer, attached, above, to the margin of the articular surface of the tibia; below, to the margin of the astragalus, in front of its articular surface. It is in relation, in front, with the Extensor tendons of the toes, with the tendons of the Tibialis anticus and Peroneus tertius, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve ; behind, it lies in contact with the synovial membrane. The Posterior Tibio-tarsal Ligament is very thin, and consists principally of transverse fibres. It is attached, above, to the margin of the articular surface of the tibia, blending with the transverse tibio-fibular Ijgament; below, to the astragalus,ANKLE-JOINT 353 behind its superior articular facet. Externally it is thicker than internally, where a somewhat thickened band of transverse fibres is attached to the hollow on the inner surface of the external malleolus. The Internal Lateral or Deltoid Ligament is a strong, flat, triangular band, attached, above, to the apex and anterior and posterior borders of the inner mal- leolus. The most anterior fibres pass forwards to be inserted into the navicular bone and the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament ; the middle descend almost perpendicularly to be inserted into the sustentaculum tali of the os calcis ; and the posterior fibres pass backwards and outwards to be attached to the inner side of the astragalus. This hgament is covered by the tendons of the Tibiahs posticus and Flexor longus digitorum muscles. The External Lateral Ligament (fig. 264) consists of three distinctly special- ised fasciculi of the capsule, taking different directions, and separated by distinct Fig. 263.—Ankle-joint: tarsal and tarso-metatarsal articulations. Internal view. Eight side. intervals; for which reason it is described by some anatomists as three distinct ligaments.* The anterior fasciculus (anterior astragalo-fibular), the shortest of the three, passes from the anterior margin of the summit of the external malleolus, downwards and forwards, to the astragalus, in front of its external articular facet. The posterior fascicuhcs (posterior astragalo-fibular), the most deeply seated, passes from the depression at the inner and back part of the external malleolus to a prominent tiibercle on the posterior surface of the astragalus. Its fibres are almost horizontal in direction. The middle fasciculus (calcaneo-fibular), the longest of the three, is a narrow, rounded cord, passing from the apex of the external malleolus downwards and slightly backwards to a tubercle on the outer surface of the os calcis. It is covered by the tendons of the Peroneus longus and brevis. The Synovial Membrane invests the inner surface of the ligaments, and sends a duplicature upwards between the lower extremities of the tibia and fibula for a short distance. Relations.—The tendons, vessels, and nerves in connection with the joint are, * Humphry On the Skeleton, p. 559. A A354 AETICULATIONS in front, from within outwards, the Tibiahs anticns, Extensor proprius halkicis, anterior tibial vessels, anterior tibial nerve, Extensor communis digitormn, and Peroneus tertius ; behind, from within outwards, the Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus digitorum, posterior tibial vessels, posterior tibial nerve. Flexor longus hallucis ; and, in the groove behind the external malleolus, the tendons of the Peroneus longus and brevis. The Arteries supplying the joint are derived from the malleolar branches of the anterior tibial and the peroneal. The Nerves are derived from the anterior and posterior tibial. Actions.—The movements of the joint are those of flexion and extension. The malleoli tightly embrace the astragalus in all positions of the joint, so that any slight degree of lateral movement which may exist is simply due to stretching of the inferior tibio-fibular ligaments, and slight bending of the shaft of the fibula. Of the ligaments, the internal, or deltoid, is of very great power—so much so, that it usually resists a force which fractures the process of bone to which it is attached. Its middle portion, together with the middle fasciculus of the Fig. 264.—Ankle-joint: tarsal and tarso-metatarsal articulations. External view. Right side. external lateral ligament, binds the bones of the leg firmly to the foot, and resists displacement in every direction. Its anterior and posterior fibres limit extension and flexion of the foot respectively, and the anterior fibres also limit abduction. The posterior portion of the external lateral ligament assists the middle portion in resisting the displacement of the foot backwards, and deepens the cavity for the reception of the astragalus. The anterior fasciculus is a security against the dis- placement of the foot forwards, and limits extension of the joint. The movements of abduction and adduction of the foot, together Avith the minute changes in form by which it is applied to the ground or takes hold of an object in climbing, etc., are mainly effected in the tarsal joints ; the one which enjoys the greatest amount of motion being that between the astragalus and os calcis behind, and the navicular and cuboid in front. This is often called the transverse or meclio-tarsal joint, and it can, with the subordinate joints of the tarsus, replace the ankle-joint in a great measure when the latter has become ankylosed. Extension of the tarsal bones upon the tibia and fibula is produced by the Gastrocnemius, Soleus, Plantaris, Tibialis posticus, Peroneus longus and brevis,ANKLE-JOINT 355 Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longus hallncis. Flexion, by the Tibialis anticus, Peroneus tertius, Extensor longus digitorum, and Extensor proprius hallncis.* Adduction, in the extended position, is produced by the Tibialis anticus and posticus ; and abduction by the Peronei. S'lLvface Form.—The line of the ankle-joint may be indicated by a transverse line drawn across the front of the lower part of the leg, about half an inch above the level of the tip of the internal malleolus. SiLTgical Anatomy.—Displacement of the trochlear sm'-face of the astragalus from the tibio-fibular mortise is not of common occurrence, as the ankle-joint is a very strong and powerful articulation, and great force is required to produce it. Nevertheless, dislocation does occasionally occur, both in an antero-posterior and a lateral direction. In the latter, which is the most common, fracture is a necessary accompaniment of the injury. The dislocation in these cases is somewhat peculiar, and is not a displacement in a horizontally lateral direction, such as usually occurs in lateral dislocations of ginglymoid joints, but the astragalus undergoes a partial rotation round an antero-posterior axis drawn through its own centre, so that the superior surface, instead of being directed upwards, is inclined more or less inwards or outwards according to the variety of the displacement. Fig. 265.—Section of the right foot near its inner border, dividing the tibia, astragalus, navicular, internal cuneiform, and first metatarsal bone, and the first phalanx of the great toe. (After Braune.) The ankle-joint is more frequently sprained than any joint in the body, and this nia,y lead to acute synovitis. In these cases, when the synovial sac is distended with fluid, the bulging appears principally in the front of the joint, beneath the anterior tendons, and on either side, betw^een the Tibialis anticus and the internal lateral ligament on the inner side, and between the Peroneus tertius and the external lateral ligament on tlie outer side. In addition to this, bulging frequently occm^s posteriorly, and a fluctuati]ig sw^ellinti^ may be detected on either side of the tendo Achillis. Chronic synovitis may result from frequent sprains, and when once this joint has been sprained it is more liable to a recurrence of the injury than it was before ; or it may be tuber- cular in its origin, the disease usually commencing in the astragalus and extending to the joint, though it may commence as a tubercular synovitis the result probably of some slight strain in a tubercular subject. Excision of the ankle-joint is not often performed, for two reasons. In the first })lace, disease of the articulation for which this operation is indicated is frequently associated with disease of the tarsal bones, which prevents its performance ; and, secondly, the foot after excision is frequently of very little use ; far less, in fact, than after a Symes's amputation, which is often, therefore, a preferable operation in these cases. Excision may, however, be attempted in cases of tubercular arthritis, in a young and otherwise healthy subject, where the disease is limited to the bones forming the joint. It may also be required after injury, * The student must bear in mind that the Extensor longus digitorum and Extensor proprius hallncis are extensors of the toes, but flexors of the ankle ; and that the Flexor lont^us digitorum and Flexor longus hallucis are flexors of the toes, but extensors of the ankle. A A 2356 AETICULATIONS where the vessels and nerves have not been damaged and the patient is young and free from visceral disease. The excision is best performed by two lateral incisions. One com- mencing two and a half inches above the external malleolus, carried down the posterior border of the fibula, round the end of the bone, and then forwards and downwards as far as the calcaneo-cuboid joint, midway between the tip of the external malleolus and the tuberosity on the fifth metatarsal bone. Through this incision the fibula is cleared, the external lateral ligament is divided, and the bone sawn through at the ujDper end of the incision and removed. A similar curved incision is now made on the inner side of the foot, commencing two and a half inches above the lower end of the tibia, carried down the posterior border of the bone, roimd the mternal malleolus and forwards and downwards to the tuberosity of the navicular bone. Through this incision the tibia is cleared in front and behind, the internal lateral, the anterior and posterior ligaments divided, and the end of the tibia protruded through the wound by displacing the foot outwards, and sawn oft' sufficiently high to secure a healthy section of bone. The articular surface of the astragalus is now to be sawn off or the whole bone removed. In cases where the operation is performed for tubercular artliritis, the latter course is probably preferable, as the injury done by the saw is frequentlj^ the starting point of fresh caries ; and after removal of the whole bone the shortening is not appreciably increased, and the result as regards union appears to be as good as when two sawn surfaces of bone are brought into apposition. Y. Articulations of the Tarsus 1. Articulations of the Os Calcis and Astragalus The articulations between the os calcis and astragalus are two in number— anterior and posterior. They are arthrodial joints. The bones are connected together by four ligaments :— External Calcaneo-astragaloid. Posterior Calcaneo-astragaloid. Internal Calcaneo-astragaloid. Interosseous. The External Calcaneo-astragaloid Ligament (fig. 264) is a short, strong, fasciculus, passing from the outer surface of the astragalus, immediately beneath its external malleolar facet, to the outer surface of the os calcis. It is placed in front of the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint, with the fibres of which it is parallel. The Internal Calcaneo-astragaloid Ligament is a band of fibres connecting the internal tubercle of the back of the astragalus with the back of the sustentaculum tali. Its fibres blend with those of the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament. The Posterior Calcaneo-astragaloid Ligament (fig. 263) connects the posterior external tubercle of the astragalus Avith the upper and inner part of the os calcis ; it is a short, narrow band, the fibres of which radiate from their narrow attach- ment to the astragalus. The Interosseous Ligament forms the chief bond of union between the bones. It consists of numerous vertical and oblique fibres, attached by one extremity to the groove between the articulating facets on the under surface of the astragalus ; by the other, to a corresponding depression on the upper surface of the os calcis. It is very thick and strong, being at least an inch in breadth from side to side, and serves to unite the os calcis and astragalus solidly together. The Synovial Membranes (fig. 267) are two in number : one for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; a second for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid j oint. The latter synovial membrane is continued forwards between the contiguous surfaces of the astragalus and navicular bones. Actions.—The movements permitted between the astragalus and os calcis are limited to a gliding of the one bone on the other in a direction from before back- wards, and from side to side. 2. Articulations of the Os Calcis with the Cuboid The ligaments connecting the os calcis with the cuboid are four in number:— Dorsal / ^^P^^'^^^' Calcaneo-cuboid. Plantar. \ Internal Calcaneo-cuboid (Interosseous). Long Calcaneo-cuboid. Short Calcaneo-cuboid.357 OF OS CALCIS WITH NAVICULAR The Superior Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament (fig. 264)isathin and narrow fasciculus, which passes between the contiguous surfaces of the os calcis and cuboid, on the dorsal surface of the joint. The Internal Calcaneo-cuboid (Interosseous) Ligament (fig. 264) is a short, but thick and strong, band of fibres, arising from the os calcis, in the deep hollow which intervenes between it and the astragalus, and closely blended, at its origin, with the superior calcaneo-navicular ligament. It is inserted into the inner side of the cuboid bone. This ligament forms one of the chief bonds of anion between the first and second rows of the tarsus. The Long Calcaneo-cuboid (Long Plantar) Ligament (fig. 266), the more super- ficial of the two plantar ligaments, is the longest of all the ligaments of the tarsus : it is attached to the under surface of the os calcis, from near the tuberosities, as far forwards as the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be attached to the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone, the more superficial fibres being continued onwards to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. This ligament crosses the groove on the under surface of the cuboid bone, convert- ing it into a canal for the passage of the tendon of the Peroneus longus. The Short Calcaneo-cuboid (Short Plantar) Ligament lies nearer to the bones than the preceding, from which it is separated by a little adipose tissue. It is exceedingly broad, about an inch in length, and extends from the tubercle, and the depression in front of it, on the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis, to the inferior surface of the cuboid bone behind the peroneal groove. Synovial Membrane.—The synovial membrane in this joint is distinct. It lines the inner surface of the ligaments. Actions.—The movements permitted between the os calcis and cuboid are limited to a slight gliding upon each other. 3. The Ligaments connecting the Os Calcis and Navicular Though these two bones do not directly articulate, they are connected together by two ligaments :— Superior or External Calcaneo-navicular. Inferior or Internal Calcaneo-navicular. The Superior or External Calcaneo-navicular (fig. 264) arises, as already mentioned, with the internal calcaneo-cuboid in the deep hollow between the astragalus and os calcis ; it passes forwards from the inner side of the anterior extremity of the os calcis to the outer side of the navicular bone. These two ligaments resemble the letter Y, being blended together behind, but separated in front. The Inferior or Internal Calcaneo-navicular (fig. 266) is by far the larger and stronger of the two ligaments between these bones ; it is a broad and thick band of fibres, which passes forwards and inwards from the anterior margin of the susten- taculum tali of the os calcis to the under surface of the navicular bone. This ligament not only serves to connect the os calcis and navicular, but supports the head of the astragalus, forming part of the articular cavity in which it is received. The up-per surface presents a fibro-cartilaginous facet, lined by the synovial membrane continued from the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation, upon which the head of the astragalus rests. Its under surface is in contact with the tendon of the Tibialis posticus muscle ; * its inner border is blended with the fore part of the Deltoid ligament, thus completing the socket for the head of the astragalus. Surgical Anatomy.—The inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament, by supporting the head of the astragalus, is principally concerned in maintaining the arch of the foot, and, when * Mr. Hancock describes an extension of this ligament upwards on the inner side of the foot, which completes the socket of the joint in that direction. Lancet, 1866, vol. i. p. 618.358 AETICULATIONS it yields, the head of the astragakis is pressed downwards, inwards, and forwards by the weight of the body, and the foot becomes flattened, expanded, and turned outwards, con- stituting the disease known as fiat-fooi. This ligament contains a considerable amount of elastic fibre, so as to give elasticity- to the arch and spring to the foot ; hence it is sometimes called the ' spring' ligament. It is supported, on its under surface, by the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, which spreads out at its insertion into a number of fasciculi, which are attached to most of the tarsal and meta- tarsal bones; this prevents undue stretching Fig. 266. —Ligaments of plantar sm^face of the ligament, and is a protection against the occurrence of flat-foot. 4. Akticulation of the Asteagalus WITH THE NaVICULAE BoNE The articulation between the astra- galus and navicular is an artlirodial joint: the rounded head of the astragalus being received into the concavity formed by the posterior surface of the navicular, the anterior articulating surface of the cal- caneum, and the upper surface of the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament, which fills up the triangular interval between those bones. The only ligament of this joint is the superior astragalo- navicular. It is a broad band, which passes obliquely forwards from the neck of the astragalus to the superior surface of the navicular bone. It is thin, and weak in texture, and covered by the Extensor tendons. The inferior calcaneo- navicular supplies the place of an inferior ligament. The Synovial Membrane which lines the joint is continued forwards from the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation. Actions.—This articulation permits of considerable mobility; but its feebleness is such as to allow occasionally of disloca- tion of the other bones of the tarsus from the astragalus. The transverse tarsal or medio-tar sal joint is formed by the articulation of the OS calcis with the cuboid, and by the articulation of the astragalus with the navicular. The movement which takes place in this joint is more extensive than that in the other tarsal joints, and consists of a sort of rotation by means of w^hich the sole of the foot may be slightly flexed and extended or carried inwards and outwards. 5. The Akticulation of the Navicular with the Cuneiform Bones The navicular is connected to the three cuneiform bones by Dorsal and Plantar ligaments. The Dorsal Ligaments are small, longitudinal bands of fibrous tissue, arranged as three bundles, one to each of the cuneiform bones. That bundle of fibres which connects the navicular with the internal cuneiform is continued round the inner side of the articulation to be continuous with the plantar ligament which connects these two bones. The Plantar Ligaments have a similar arrangement to those on the dorsum. They are strengthened by processes given off from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. of the foot.359 OF THE TARSUS Actions.—The movements permitted between the navicular and cuneiform bones are limited to a slight gliding upon each other. The Synovial Membrane of these joints is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. 6. The Articulation of the Navicular v^ith the Cuboid The navicular bone is connected with the cuboid by Dorsal, Plantar, and Interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal Ligament consists of a band of fibrous tissue which passes obliquely forwards and outwa,rds from the navicular to the cuboid bone. The Plantar Ligament consists of a band of fibrous tissue which passes nearly transversely between these two bones. The Interosseous Ligament consists of strong transverse fibres which pass between the rough non-articular portions of the lateral surfaces of these tw^o bones. Actions.—The movements permitted between the navicular and cuboid bones are limited to a slight gliding upon each other. The Synovial Membrane of this joint is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. 7, The Articulation of the Cuneiform Bones with each other These bones are connected together by Dorsal, Plantar, and Interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal Ligaments consist of two bands of fibrous tissue which pass trans- versely : one connecting the internal with the middle cuneiform, and the other connecting the middle with the external cuneiform. The Plantar Ligaments have a similar arrangement to those on the dorsum. They are strengthened by the processes given off from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. The Interosseous Ligaments consist of strong transverse fibres which pass between the rough non-articular portions of the lateral surfaces of the adjacent cuneiform bones. The Synovial Membrane of these joints is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. Actions.—The movements permitted between the cuneiform bones are limited to a slight gliding upon each other. 8. The Articulation of the External Cuneiform Bone with the Cuboid These bones are connected together by Dorsal, Plantar, and Interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal Ligament consists of a band of fibrous tissue which passes trans ■ versely between these two bones. The Plantar Ligament has a similar arrangement. It is strengthened by a process given off from the tendon of the Tibialis posticus. The Interosseous Ligament consists of strong transverse fibres which pass between the rough non-articular portions of the lateral surfaces of the adjacent sides of these two bones. The Synovial Mem.brane of this joint is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. Actions. —The movements permitted between the external cuneiform and cuboid are limited to a slight gliding upon each other. Nerve-supply.—All the joints of the tarsus are supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. Surgical Anatomy.—In spite of the great strength of the ligaments which connect the tarsal bones together, dislocation at some of the tarsal joints does occasionally occur ;ARTICULATIONS 360 though, on account of the spongy character of the bones, they are more frequently broken than dislocated, as the result of violence. When dislocation does occur, it is most commonly in connection with the astragalus; for not only may this bone be dislocated from the tibia and fibula at the ankle-joint, but the other bones may be dislocated from it, the trochlear surface of the bone remaining in situ in the tibio-fibular mortise. This constitutes what is known as the suh-astragaloid dislocation. Or, again, the astragalus may be dislocated from all its connections—fi^om the tibia and fibula above, the os calcis below, and the navicular in front—and may even undergo a rotation, either on a vertical or horizontal axis. In the former case the long axis of the bone becoming directed across the joint, so that the head faces the articular surface on one or other malleolus; or, in the latter, the lateral surfaces becoming directed upwards and downwards, so that the trochlear surface faces to one or the other side. Finally, dislocation may occur at the medio- tarsal joint, the anterior tarsal bones being luxated from the astragalus and calcaneum. The other tarsal bones are also, occasionally, though rarely, dislocated from their connections. VI. Taeso-metataesal Articulations These are arthrodial joints. The bones entering into their formation are four tarsal bones, viz. the internal, middle and external cuneiform, and the cuboid, which articulate with the metatarsal bones of the five toes. The metatarsal bone of the great toe articulates with the internal cuneiform ; that of the second is deeply wedged in between the internal and external cuneiform, resting against the middle cuneiform, and being the most strongly articulated of all the metatarsal bones ; the third metatarsal articulates with the extremity of the external cuneiform ; the fourth, with the cuboid and external cuneiform ; and the fifth, with the cuboid. The articular surfaces are covered with cartilage, lined by synovial membrane, and connected together by the following ligaments :— Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous. The Dorsal Ligaments consist of strong, flat, fibrous bands, which connect the tarsal with the metatarsal bones. The first metatarsal is connected to the internal cuneiform by a single broad, thin, fibrous band; the second has three dorsal ligaments, one from each cuneiform bone ; the third has one from the external cuneiform; the fourth has two, one from the external cuneiform and one from the cuboid; and the fifth, one from the cuboid. The Plantar Ligaments consist of longitudinal and oblique, fibrous bands connecting the tarsal and metatarsal bones, but disposed with less regularity than on the dorsal surface. Those for the first and second metatarsal are the most strongly marked; the second and third metatarsal receive strong fibrous bands, which pass obliquely across from the internal cuneiform ; the plantar ligaments of the fourth and fifth metatarsal consist of a feAv scanty fibres derived from the cuboid. The Interosseous Ligaments are three in number : internal, middle, and external. The internal one passes from the outer extremity of the internal cuneiform to the adjacent angle of the second metatarsal. The middle one, less strong than the preceding, connects the external cuneiform with the adjacent angle of the second metatarsal. The external interosseous ligament connects the outer angle of the external cuneiform with the adjacent side of the third metatarsal. The Synovial Membrane between the internal cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone is a distinct sac. The synovial membrane between the middle and external cuneiform behind, and the second and third metatarsal bones in front, is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. Tw^o prolongations are sent forwards from it, one between the adjacent sides of the second and third metatarsal bones, and one between the third and fourth metatarsal bones. The synovial membrane between the cuboid and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones is a distinct sac. From it a prolongation is sent forwards between the fourth and fifth metatarsal Lones. Actions.—The movements permitted between the tarsal and metatarsal bones are limited to a slight gliding upon each other.SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES IN TARSAL AND METATARSAL JOINTS 361 Articulations op the Metatarsal Bones with each other The base of the first metatarsal bone is not connected with the second meta- tarsal bone by any ligaments ; in this respect it resembles the thumb. The bases of the four outer metatarsal bones are connected together by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal Ligaments consist of bands of fibrous tissue which pass transversely between the adjacent metatarsal bones. The Plantar Ligaments have a similar arrangement to those on the dorsum. The Interosseous Ligaments consist of strong transverse fibres which pass between the rough non-articular portions of the lateral surfaces. The Synovial Membrane between the second and third, and the third and fourth metatarsal bones is part of the great tarsal synovial membrane. Fig. 267.—Oblique section of the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus. Showing the six synovial membranes. The synovial membrane between the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones is a prolongation of the synovial membrane of the cubo-metatarsal joint. Actions.—The movement permitted in the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones is limited to a slight gliding of the articular surfaces upon one another. The Synovial Membranes in the Tarsal and Metatarsal Joints The Synovial Membranes (fig. 267) found in the articulations of the tarsus and metatarsus are six in number : one for the posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation ; a second for the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-navicular articulations; a third for the calcaneo-cuboid articulation ; and a fourth for the articulations of the navicular with the three cuneiform, the three cuneiform with each other, the external cuneiform with the cuboid, and the middle and external cuneiform with the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones, and the lateral surfaces of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones with each other; a fifth for the internal cuneiform with the metatarsal bone of the great toe ; and a sixth for the articulation of the cuboid with the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. A small synovial membrane is sometimes found between the contiguous surfaces of the navicular and cuboid bones. Nerve-supply.—The nerves supplying^the tarso-metatarsal joints are derived from the anterior tibial. The digital extremities of all the metatarsal bones are connected together by the transverse metatarsal ligament.362 ARTICULATIONS The Transverse Metatarsal Ligament is a narrow fibrous band which passes transversely across the anterior extremities of all the metatarsal bones, connecting them together. It is blended anteriorly with the plantar (glenoid) ligament of the metatarso-phalangeal articulations. To its posterior border is connected the fascia covering the Interossei muscles. Its superficial surface is concave where the flexor tendons pass over it. Beneath it the tendons of the Interossei muscles pass to their insertion. It differs from the transverse metacarpal ligament in that it connects the metatarsal bone of the great toe with the rest of the metatarsal bones. Metatarso-phalangeal Articulations The metatarso-phalangeal articulations are of the condyloid kind, formed by the reception of the rounded head of the metatarsal bone into a superficial cavity in the extremity of the first phalanx. The ligaments are Plantar. Two Lateral. The Plantar Ligaments (Glenoid ligaments of Cruveilhier) are thick, dense, fibrous structures. Each is placed on the plantar surface of the joint in the interval between the lateral ligaments, to which they are connected ; they are loosely united to the metatarsal bone, but very firmly to the base of the first phalanges. Their plantar surface is intimately blended with the transverse meta- tarsal ligament, and presents a groove for the passage of the flexor tendons, the sheath surrounding which is connected to each side of the groove. By their deep surface, they form part of the articular surface for the head of the metatarsal bone, and are lined by a synovial membrane. The Lateral Ligaments are strong, rounded cords, placed one on each side of the joint, each being attached, by one extremity, to the posterior tubercle on the side of the head of the metatarsal bone ; and, by the other, to the contiguous extremity of the phalanx. The Posterior Ligament is supplied by the extensor tendon placed over the back of the joint. Actions.—The movements permitted in the metatarso-phalangeal articulations are flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Articulations of the Phalanges The articulations of the phalanges are ginglymus joints. The ligaments are :— Plantar. Two lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those in the metatarso- phalangeal articulations; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament. Actions.—The only movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension; these movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The movement of flexion is very considerable, but extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. Surface Form.— Y\-iQ principal joints wliich it is necessary to distinguish, with regard to the surgery of the foot, are the medio-tarsal and the tarso-metatarsal joints. The joint between the astrao-alus and the navicular is best found by means of the tubercle of the navicular bone, for the line of the joint is immediately behind this process. If the foot is grasped and forcibly extended, a rounded prominence, the head of the astragalus, ^yill appear on the inner side of the dorsum in front of the ankle-joint, and if a knife is carried downwards, just in front of this prominence and behind the line of the navicular tubercle, it will enter the astragalo-navicular joint. The calcaneo-cuboid joint is situated midway between the external malleolus and the prominent end of the fifth metatarsal bone._ The plane of the joint is in the same line as that of the astragalo-navicular. The position ofOF THE PHALANGES 363 the joint between the fifth metatarsal bone and the cuboid is easily found by the projection of the fifth metatarsal bone, which is the guide to it. The direction of the line of the joint is ver}' oblique, so that, if continued onwards, it would pass through the head of the first metatarsal bone. The joint between the fourth metatarsal bone and the cuboid and external cuneiform is the direct continuation inwards of the previous joint, but its plane is less oblique ; it would be represented by a line drawn from the outer side of the arti- culation to the middle of the first metatarsal bone. The plane of the joint between the third metatarsal bone and the external cuneiform is almost transverse. It would be represented by a line drawn from the outer side of the joint to the base of the first meta- tarsal bone. The tarso-metatarsal articulation of the great toe corresponds to a groove which can be felt by making firm pressure on the inner side of the foot one inch in front of the tubercle on the navicular bone ; and the joint between the second metatarsal bone and the middle cuneiform is to be found on the dorsum of the foot, half an inch behind the level of the tarso-metatarsal joint of the great toe. The line of the joints between the metatarsal bones and the first phalanges is about an inch behind the webs of the corresponding toes.THE MUSCLES AND FASCIA* THE Muscles are connected Avith the bones, cartilages, ligaments, and skin, either directly or through the intervention of fibrous structures, called tendons or aponeuroses. Where a muscle is attached to bone or cartilage, the fibres terminate in blunt extremities upon the periosteum or perichondrium, and do not come into direct relation with the osseous or cartilaginous tissue. Where muscles are connected with the skin, they either lie as a flattened layer beneath it, or are connected with its areolar tissue by larger or smaller bundles of fibres, as in the muscles of the face. The muscles vary extremely in their form. In the limbs, they are of consider- able length, especially the more superficial ones, the deep ones being generally broad ; they surround the bones, and form an important protection to the various joints. In the trunk, they are broad, flattened, and expanded, forming the parietes of the cavities which they enclose ; hence the reason of the terms, long, broad, short, etc., used in the description of a muscle. There is a considerable variation in the arrangement of the fibres of certain muscles with reference to the tendons to which they are attached. In some, the fibres are parallel and run directly from their origin to their insertion; these are quadrilateral muscles, such as the Thyro-hyoid. A modification of these is found in the fusiform muscles, in which the fibres are not quite parallel, but slightly curved, so that the muscle tapers at each end; in their action, however, they resemble the quadrilateral muscles. Secondly, in other muscles the fibres are convergent; arising by a broad origin, they converge to a narrow or pointed insertion. This arrangement of fibres is found in the triangular muscles—e.g. the Temporal. In some muscles, which otherwise would belong to the quadrilateral or triangular type, the origin and insertion are not in the same plane, but the plane of the line of origin intersects that of their insertion : such is the case in the Pectineus muscle. Thirdly, in some muscles the fibres are oblique and converge, like the plumes of a pen, to one side of a tendon, which runs the entire length of the muscle. Such a muscle is rhomboidal or penniform, as the Peronei. xA. modification of these rhomboidal muscles is found in those cases where oblique fibres converge to both sides of a central tendon which runs down the middle of the muscle ; these are called bipenniform, and an example is aflbrded in the Piectus femoris. Finally, we have muscles in which the fibres are arranged in curved bundles in one or more planes, as in the Sphincter muscles. The arrangement of the muscular fibres is of considerable importance in respect to their relative strength and range of movement. Those muscles where the fibres are long and few in number have great range, but diminished strength; where, on the other The Muscles and Fascite are described conjointly, in order that the student may consider the arrangement of the latter in his dissection of the former. It is rare for the student of anatomy in this country to have the opportunity of dissecting the fasciae separately ; and it is for this reason, as well as from the close connection that exists between the muscles and theii^ investing sheaths, that they are considered together. Some general observations are first made on the anatomy of the muscles and fasciae, the special description being given in connection with the different regions.GENERAL ANATOMY 365 hand, tlie fibres are short and more numerous, there is great power, but lessened range. Muscles differ much in size : the Gastrocnemius forms the chief bulk of the back of the leg, and the fibres of the Sartorius are nearly two feet in length, whilst the Stapedius, a small muscle of the internal ear, weighs about a grain, and its fibres are not more than two lines in length. The names applied to the various muscles have been derived: i, from their situation, as the Tibialis, Radialis, Ulnaris, Peroneus; 2, from their direction, as the Rectus abdominis, Obliqui capitis, Transversalis ; 3, from their uses, as Flexors, Extensors, Abductors, etc.; 4, from their shape, as the Deltoid, Trapezius, Rhom- boideus ; 5, from the number of their divisions, as the Biceps, the Triceps; 6, from their points of attachment, as the Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid. In the description of a muscle, the term origin is meant to imply its more fixed or central attachment; and the term insertion the movable point to which the force of the muscle is directed ; but the origin is absolutely fixed in only a very small number of muscles, such as those of the face, which are attached by one extremity to the bone, and by the other to the movable integument; in the greater number, the muscle can be made to act from either extremity. In the dissection of the muscles, the student should pay especial attention to the exact origin, insertion, and actions of each, and its more important relations with surrounding parts. An accurate knowledge of the points of attachment of the muscles is of great importance in the determination of their action. By a knowledge of the action of the muscles, the surgeon is able to explain the causes of displacement in various forms of fracture, and the causes which produce distortion in various deformities, and, consequently, to adopt appropriate treatment in each case. The relations, also, of some of the muscles, especially those in immediate apposition with the larger blood-vessels, and the surface-markings they produce, should be especially remembered, as they form useful guides in the application of a ligature to those vessels. Tendons are white, glistening, fibrous cords, varying in length and thickness, sometimes round, sometimes flattened, of considerable strength, and devoid of elasticity. They consist almost entirely of white fibrous tissue, the fibrils of which have an undulating course parallel with each other, and are firmly united together. They are very sparingly supplied with blood-vessels, the smaller tendons presenting in their interior not a trace of them. Nerves also are not present in the smaller tendons ; but the larger ones, as the tendo Achillis, receive nerves which accompany the nutrient vessels. The tendons consist principally of a substance which yields gelatine. Aponeuroses are flattened or ribbon-shaped tendons, of a pearly-white colour, iridescent, glistening, and similar in structure to the tendons. They are destitute of nerves, and the thicker ones only sparingly supplied with blood-vessels. The tendons and aponeuroses are connected, on the one hand, with the muscles; and, on the other hand, with the movable structures, as the bones, cartilages, ligaments, fibrous membranes (for instance, the sclerotic), and the synovial mem- branes (subcrureus). Where the muscular fibres are in a direct line with those of the tendon or aponeurosis, the two are directly continuous, the muscular fibre being distinguishable from that of the tendon only by its striation. But where the muscular fibre joins the tendon or aponeurosis at an oblique angle, the former terminates, according to Kolliker, in rounded extremities, which are received into corresponding depressions on the surface of the latter, the connective tissue between the fibres being continuous with that of the tendon. The latter mode of attachment occurs in all the penniform and bipenniform muscles, and in those muscles the tendons of which commence in a membranous form, as the Gastrocnemius and Soleus. The fasciae (fascia, a bandage) are fibro-areolar or aponeurotic lamina, of variable thickness and strength, found in all regions of the body, investing theMUSCLES AND FASCIA 366 softer and more delicate organs. The fasciae have been subdivided, from the situation in which they are found, into two groups, superficial and deep. The superficial fascia is found immediately beneath the integument over almost the entire surface of the body. It connects the skin with the deep or aponeurotic fascia, and consists of fibro-areolar tissue, containing in its meshes pellicles of fat in varying quantity. In the eyelids and scrotum, where adipose tissue is rarely deposited, this tissue is very liable to serous infiltration. The superficial fascia varies in thickness in different parts of the body: in the groin it is so thick as to be capable of being subdivided in several laminae, but in the palm of the hand it is of extreme thinness, and intimately adherent to the integument. The superficial fascia is capable of separation into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves, as the superficial epigastric vessels in the abdominal region, the radial and ulnar veins in the forearm, the saphenous veins in the leg and thigh, and the superficial lymphatic glands ; certain cutaneous muscles also are situated in the superficial fascia, as the Platysma myoides in the neck, and the Orbicularis palpebrarum around the eyelids. This fascia is most distinct at the lower part of the abdomen, the scrotum, perinaeum, and extremities ; is very thin in those regions where muscular fibres are inserted into the integument, as on the side of the neck, the face, and around the margin of the anus. It is very dense in the scalp, in the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, forming a fibro-fatty layer, which binds the integument firmly to the subjacent structure. The superficial fascia connects the skin to the subjacent parts, facilitates the movement of the skin, serves as a soft nidus for the passage of vessels and nerves to the integument, and retains the warmth of the body, since the fat contained in its areolae is a bad conductor of caloric. The cleei) fascia is a dense inelastic unyielding fibrous membrane, forming sheaths for the muscles, and affording them broad surfaces for attachment. It consists of shining tendinous fibres, placed parallel with one another, and connected together by other fibres disposed in a rectilinear manner. It is usually exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, forming a strong investment, which not only binds down collectively the muscles in each region, but gives a separate sheath to each, as well as to the vessels and nerves. The fasciae are thick in unprotected situations, as on the outer side of a limb, and thinner on the inner side. The deep fascia assist the muscles in their action, by the degree of tension and pressure they make upon their surface : and, in certain situations, this is increased and regulated by muscular action, as, for instance, by the Tensor vagina femoris and Gluteus maxi- mus in the thigh, by the Biceps in the upper and lower extremities, and Palmaris longus in the hand. In the limbs, the fasciae not only invest the entire limb, but give off septa which separate the various muscles, and are attached beneath to the periosteum : these prolongations of fasciae are usually spoken of as intermuscular septa. The Muscles and Fasciae may be arranged, according to the general division of the body, into those of the cranium, face, and neck ; those of the trunk; those of the upper extremity ; and those of the lower extremity. MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE CEANIUM AND FACE The muscles of the Cranium and Face consist of ten groups, arranged according to the region in which they are situated. 1. Cranial Kegion. 6. Superior Maxillary Eegion. 2. Auricular Eegion. 7. Inferior Maxillary Eegion. 3. Palpebral Eegion. 8. Intermaxillary Eegion. 4. Orbital Eegion. 9. Temporo-maxillary Eegion. 5. Nasal Eegion. 10.

Cranial Region—Occipito-fkontalis Dissection (fig. 268).—The head being shaved, and a block placed beneath the back of the neck, make a vertical incision through the skin from before backwards, commencing at the root of the nose in front, and terminating behind at the occipital protuberance; Fig. 268.—Dissection of the head, face, and neck. 1 Dissection of scalp 2, 3, of auricular region 7, 8, of neck make a second incision in a horizontal direction along the forehead and round the side of the head, from the anterior to the posterior extremity of the precedmg. Raise the skin in front, from the subjacent muscle, from below upwards ; this must be done with extreme care, removing the integument from the outer surface of the vessels and the nerves which lie between the two.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 368 The Skin of the Scalp.—This is thicker than in any other part of the body. It is intimately adherent to the superficial fascia. The hair-follicles are very closely set together, and extend throughout the whole thickness of the skin. It also contains a number of sebaceous glands. The superficial fascia in the cranial region is a firm, dense, fibro-fatty layer, intimately adherent to the integument, and to the Occipito-frontalis and its tendinous aponeurosis ; it is continuous, behind, with the superficial fascia at the back part of the neck; and, laterally, is continued over the temporal fascia. It contains between its layers the superficial vessels and nerves and much granular fat. The Occipito-frontalis (fig. 269) is a broad musculo-fibrous layer, which covers the whole of one side of the vertex of the skull, from the occiput to the eyebrow. It consists of two muscular slips, separated by an intervening tendinous aponeurosis.369 AURICULAE REGION The occipital portion, thin, quadrilateral in form, and about an inch and a half in length, arises from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal. Its fibres of origin are tendinous, but they soon become muscular, and ascend in a parallel direction to terminate in the tendinous aponeurosis. The frontal portion is thin, of a quadri- lateral form, and intimately adherent to the superficial fascia. It is broader, its fibres are longer, and their structure paler than the occipital portion. Its internal fibres are continuous with those of the Pyramidalis nasi. Its middle fibres become blended with the Corrugator supercilii and Orbicularis palpebrarum; and the outer fibres are also blended with the latter muscle over the external angular process. According to Theile the innermost fibres are attached to the nasal bones, the outer to the external angular process of the frontal bone. From these attachments, the fibres are directed upwards and join the aponeurosis below the coronal suture. The inner margins of the frontal portions of the two muscles are joined together for some distance above the root of the nose ; but between the occipital portions there is a considerable, though variable, interval, which is occupied by the aponeurosis. The aponeurosis covers the upper part of the vertex of the skull, being continuous across the middle line with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle. Behind, it is attached, in the interval between the occipital origins, to the occipital protuberance and superior curved lines above the attachment of the Trapezius; in front, it forms a short and narrow prolongation between the frontal portions ; and on each side it has connected with it the Attollens and Attrahens aurem muscles ; in this situation it loses its aponeurotic character, and is continued over the temporal fascia to the zygoma as a layer of laminated areolar tissue. This aponeurosis is closely connected to the integument by the firm, dense, fibro- fatty layer, which forms the superficial fascia : it is connected with the pericranium by loose cellular tissue, which allows of a considerable degree of movement of the integument. Nerves.—The frontal portion of the Occipito-frontalis is supplied by the facial nerve; its occipital portion by the posterior auricular branch of the facial, and sometimes by the occipitalis minor. Actions.—The frontal portion of the muscle raises the eyebrows and the skin over the root of the nose, and at the same time draws the scalp forwards, throwing the integument of the forehead into transverse wrinkles. The posterior portion draws the scalp backwards. By bringing alternately into action the frontal and occipital portions, the entire scalp may be moved forwards and backwards. In the ordinary action, of the muscles, the eyebrows are elevated, and at the same time the aponeurosis is fixed by the posterior portion, thus giving to the face the expression of surprise: if the action is more exaggerated, the eyebrows are still further raised, and the skin of the forehead thrown into transverse wrinkles, as in the expression of fright or horror. 2. Auriculae Region (fig. 269) Attrahens aurem. Attollens aurem. Retrahens aurem. These three small muscles are placed immediately beneath the skin around the external ear. In man, in whom the external ear is almost immovable, they are rudimentary. They are the analogues of large and important muscles in some of the mammalia. Dissection.—This requires considerable care, and should be performed in the following manner :—To expose the Attollens aurem, draw the pinna or broad part of the ear down- wards, when a tense band will be felt beneath the skin, passing from the side of the head to the upper part of the concha; by dividing the skin over this band, in a direction from below upwards, and then reflecting it on each side, the muscle is exposed. To bring into view the Attrahens aurem, draw the helix backwards by means of a hook, when the muscle B BMUSCLES AND FASCI.E 370 will be made tense, and may be exposed in a similar manner to the preceding. To expose the Retrahens aurem, draw the pinna forwards, when the muscle, being made tense, may be felt beneath the skin, at its insertion into the back part of the conclia, and may be exposed in the same manner as the other muscles. The Attrahens aurem (Awicidaris anterior), the smallest of the three, is thin, fan-shaped, and its fibres pale and indistinct; they arise from the lateral edge of the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, and converge to be inserted into a projection on the front of the helix. Relations.—Superficially, with the skin ; deeply, with the areolar tissue derived from the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, beneath which are the temporal artery and vein and the temporal fascia. The AttoUens aurem (Auricularis superior), the largest of the three, is-thin and fan-shaped : its fibres arise from the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, and converge to be inserted by a thin, flattened tendon into the upper part of the cranial surface of the pinna. Relations.—Superficially, with the integument; deeply, with the areolar tissue derived from the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, beneath which is the temporal fascia. The Retrahens aurem {Auricularis posterior) consists of two or three fleshy fasciculi, which arise from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by short aponeurotic fibres. They are inserted into the lower part of the cranial surface of the concha. Relations.—Superficially, with the integument; deeply, with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Nerves.—The Attrahens and Attollens aurem are supplied by the temporal branch of the facial; the Retrahens aurem is supplied by the posterior auricular branch of the same nerve. Actions.—In man, these muscles possess very little action : the Attrahens aurem draws the ear forwards and upAvards ; the Attollens aurem slightly raises it; and the Retrahens aurem draws it backwards. 3. Palpebral Region (hg. 269) Orbicularis palpebrarum. Levator palpebrae. Corrugator supercilii. Tensor tarsi. Dissection (fig. 256).—In order to expose the muscles of the face, continue the longi- tudinal incision, made in the dissection of the Occipito-frontalis, down the median line of the face to the tip of the nose, and from this point onwards to the upper lip; and carry another incision along the margin of the lip to the angle of the mouth, and transversely across the face to the angle of the jaw. Then make an incision in front of the external ear, from the angle of the jaw upwards, to join the transverse incision made in exposing the Occipito-frontalis. These incisions include a square-shaped flap, which should be removed in the direction marked in the figure, with care, as the muscles at some points are intimately adherent to the integument. The Orbicularis palpebrarum is a sphincter muscle, which surrounds the cir- cumference of the orbit and eyelids. It arises from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary in front of the lachrymal groove for the nasal duct, and from the anterior surface and borders of a short tendon, the teiido palpebrartirii, placed at the inner angle of the orbit. From this origin, the fibres are directed outwards, forming a broad, thin, and fiat layer, which coders the eyelids, surrounds the circumference of the orbit, and spreads out over the temple, and downwards on the cheek. The palpebral portion (ciliaris) of the Orbicularis is thin and pale ; it arises from the bifurcation of the tendo palpebrarum, and forms a series of concentric curves, which are united on the outer side of the eye- lids at an acute angle by a cellular raphe, some being inserted into the external tarsal ligament and malar bone. The orbicular portion (orbicularis latus) is thicker and of a reddish colour : its fibres are Avell developed, and form complete ellipses. ThePALPEBRAL REGION 371 upper fibres of this portion blend with the Occipito-frontalis and Corrugator super ciUi. Relations.—By its sttp&rficial surface, with the integument. By its deej) surface, above, with the Occipito-frontalis and Corrugator supercilii, with which it is intimately blended, and with the supra-orbital vessels and nerve ; below, it covers the lachrymal sac, and the origin of the Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, the Levator labii superioris, and the Zygomaticus minor muscles. Inter- nally, it is occasionally blended with the Pyramidalis nasi. Externally, it lies on the temporal fascia. On the eyelids, it is separated from the conjunctiva by the Levator palpebras, the tarsal ligaments, the tarsal plates, and the Meibomian glands. The tendo palijebrarmn (tendo oculi) is a short tendon, about two lines in length and one in breadth, attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone in front of the lachrymal groove for the nasal duct. Crossing the lachrymal sac, it divides into two parts, each division being attached to the inner extremity of the corresponding tarsal plate. As the tendon crosses the lachrymal sac, a strong aponeurotic lamina is given off from the posterior surface, which expands over the sac, and is attached to the ridge on the lachrymal bone. This is the reflected aponeurosis of the tendo palpebrarum. Use of Tendo oculi.—Besides giving attachment to part of the Orbicularis palpebrarum, and to the tarsal plates, it serves to suck the tears into the lachrymal sac, by its attachment to the sac. Thus, each time the eyelids are closed, the tendo oculi becomes tightened, and draws the wall of the lachrymal sac outwards and forwards, so that a vacuum is made in the sac, and the tears are sucked along the lachrymal canals into it. The Corrugator supercilii is a small, narrow, pyramidal muscle, placed at the inner extremity of the eye- FiG. 270.—Horner's muscle.

The Tensor tarsi (Horner's muscle) (fig. 270) is a small thin muscle, about three lines in breadth and six in length, situated at the inner side of the orbit, behind the tendo oculi. It arises from the crest and adjacent part of the orbital surface of the lachrymal bone, and passing across the lachrymal sac, divides into two slips, which cover the lachrymal canals, and are inserted into the tarsal plates internal to the B B 2 / ORBICUL.°iRlS PALPEBRARUM LEV.

Its fibres appear to be continuous with those of the palpebral portion of the Orbicularis palpebrarum; it is occasionally very indistinct. Nerves.—The Orbicularis palpebrarum, Corrugator supercilii, and Tensor tarsi are supplied by the l":u'i;il lUM've. Actions.—The Orlnculaiis palpebrarum is the sphincter nniscle of the eyelids. The palpebral portion acts involuntarily, closing the lids gently, as in sleep or in blinking; the orbicular portion is subject to the will. When the entire muscle is brouglit into action, the skin of the forehead, temple, and cheek is drawn inwards to- wards the inner angle of the orbit, and the eyelids are firmly closed as in photophobia. When the skin of the forehead, temple, and cheek is thus drawn inwards by the action of the muscle it is thrown into folds, especially radiating from the outer angle of the eyelids, which give rise in old age to the so-called ' crow's feet.' The Levator palpebraa is the direct antagonist of this muscle ; it raises the upper eyelid and exposes the globe. The Corrugator supercilii draws the eyebrow downwards and inwards, producing the vertical wrinkles of the forehead. It is the ' frowning ' muscle, and may be regarded as the principal agent in the expression of sufitering. The Tensor tarsi draws the eyelids and the extremities of the lachrymal canals inwards and compresses them against the surface of the globe of the eye; thus placing them in the most favourable situation for receiving the tears. It serves, also, to compress the lachrymal sac. 4. Orbital Region (fig. 271) Levator palpebrj"e superioris. Rectus internus. Rectus superior. Rectus externus. Rectus inferior.

When the fragments are cleai'od awiiy, the periosteum of the orbit will be exposed ; this being removed, together with tlic i'at which tills the cavity of the orbit, the several muscles of this region can be examined. The dissection will be facilitated by distending the globe of the eye. Tn order to efiect this, puncture the optic nerve near the eyeball with a cur\ ed needles and ])ush the needle onwards into the globe; insert the point of a blow-pipe through this a|)erture, and force a little air into the cavity of the eyeball; then apply a ligature round the nerve so as to prevent the air escapin<i:. The globe being now drawn forwards, the muscles will be put upon the stretch.373 ORBITAL REGION The Levator palpebrae superioris is thin, flat, and- triangular in shape. It arises from the under surface of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, above and in front of the optic foramen, from which it is separated by the origin of the Superior rectus ; and is inserted, by a broad aponeurosis, into the anterior surface of the superior tarsal plate. From this aponeurosis a thin expansion is continued onwards, passing between the fibres of the Orbicularis to be inserted into the skin of the lid. At its origin, it is narrow and tendinous, but soon becomes broad and fleshy, and finally terminates in a broad aponeurosis. Relations.—By its u^jjer surface, with the frontal nerve and supra-orbital artery, the periosteum of the orbit; and, in the lid, with the inner surface of the tarsal ligament. By its under surface, with the Superior rectus ; and, in the lid, with the conjunctiva. A small branch of the third nerve enters its under surface. The Superior rectus, the thinnest and narrowest of the four Recti, arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen beneath the Levator palpebrae and Superior oblique, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; and is inserted, by a tendinous expansion, into the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations.—By its upper surface, with the Levator palpebrae. By its under surface, with the optic nerve, the ophthalmic artery, the nasal nerve, and the branch of the third nerve which supplies it; and, in front, with the tendon of the Superior oblique, and the globe of the eye. The Inferior and Internal Recti arise by a common tendon (the ligament of Zinn),* which is attached round the circumference of the optic foramen, except at its upper and outer part. The External rectus has two heads : the upper one arises from the outer margin of the optic foramen immediately beneath the Superior rectus ; the lower head, partly from the ligament of Zinn, and partly from a small pointed process of bone on the lower margin of the sphenoidal fissure. Each muscle Fig. 272.—The relative position and at- passes forward in the position implied by its name, to be inserted by a tendinous expansion (the tunica alhuginea) into the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from the margin of the cornea. Between the two heads of the External rectus is a narrow interval, through which passes the third, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth and the sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. Although nearly all of these muscles present a common origin and are inserted in a similar manner into the sclerotic coat, there are certain differences to be observed in them, as regards their length and breadth. The Internal rectus is the broadest; the External is the longest; and the Superior is the thinnest and narrowest. The Superior oblique is a fusiform muscle, placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit, internal to the Levator palpebrae. It arises about a line above the inner margin of the optic foramen, and, passing forwards to the inner angle of the orbit, terminates in a rounded tendon, which plays in a ring or pulley, formed by cartilaginous tissue attached to a depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone, the contiguous surfaces of the tendon and ring being lined by * The ligament of Zinn ought, perhaps more appropriatel}', to be termed the apo- neurosis or tendon of Zinn. Mr. C. B. Lock wood has described a somewhat similar structure on the under surface of the Superior rectus muscle, which is attached to the lesser wing of the sphenoid forming the upper and outer margin of the optic foramen.

The tendon is reflected backwards, outwards, and downwards beneath the Superior rectus to the outer part of the globe of the eye, and is inserted into the sclerotic coat, midway between the cornea and entrance of the optic nerve, the insertion of the muscle lying between the Superior and External recti. Relations.—By its uiyper surface, with the periosteum covering the roof of the orbit, and the fourth nerve. The tendon, where it lies on the globe of the eye, is covered by the Superior rectus. By its under surface, with the nasal nerve, and the upper border of the Internal rectus. The Inferior oblique is a thin, narrow muscle, placed near the anterior margin of the orbit. It arises from a depression on the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone, external to the lachrymal groove for the nasal duct. Passing out- wards, backwards, and upwards beneath the Inferior rectus, and then between the eyeball and the External rectus, it is inserted into the outer part of the sclerotic coat between the Superior and External recti, near to, but somewhat behind, the tendon of insertion of the Superior oblique. Relations.—By its ocular surface, with the globe of the eye, and with the Inferior rectus. By its orbital surface, with the periosteum covering the floor of the orbit, and with the External rectus. Its borders look forwards and backwards ; the posterior one receives a branch of the third nerve. Iferves.—The Levator palpebrae. Inferior oblique, and all the Eecti excepting the External, are supplied by the third nerve ; the Superior oblique, by the fourth ; the External rectus, by the sixth. Actions.—The Levator palpebr^e raises the upper eyelid, and is the direct antagonist of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. The four Eecti muscles are attached in such a manner to the globe of the eye, that, acting singly, they will turn it either upwards, downwards, inwards, or outwards, as expressed by their names. The movement produced by the Superior or Inferior rectus is not quite a simple one, for inasmuch as they pass obliquely outwards and forwards to the eyeball, the elevation or depression of the cornea must be accompanied by a certain deviation inwards, with a slight amount of rotation, which, however, is corrected by the Oblique muscles; the Inferior oblique correcting the deviation inwards of the Superior rectus, and the Superior oblique that of the Inferior rectus. The con- traction of the External and Internal recti, on the other hand, produces a purely horizontal movement. If any two contiguous recti of one eye act together they carry the globe of the eye in the diagonal of these directions, viz. upwards and inwards, upwards and outwards, downwards and inwards, or downwards and out- wards. The movement of circumduction, as in looking round a room, is performed by the alternate action of the four Recti. The Oblique muscles rotate the eyeball on its antero-posterior axis, this kind of movement being required for the correct viewing of an object when the head is moved laterally, as from shoulder to shoulder, in order that the picture may fall in all respects on the same part of the retina of each eye.* Surgical Anatomy.—The position and exact point of insertion of the tendons of the Internal and External recti miiscles into the globe should be carefully examined from the front of the eyeball, as the surgeon is often required to divide the one or the other muscle for the cure of strabismus. In convergent strabismus, which is the more common form of the disease, the eye is turned inwards, requiring the division of the Internal rectus. In the divergent form, which is more rare, the eye is turned outwards, the External rectus being especially hnplicated. The deformity produced in either case is to be remedied by division of one or the other muscle. The operation is thus performed : the lids are to be well separated; the eyeball being rotated outwards or inwards, the conjunctiva should be raised by a pair of forceps, and divided immediately beneath the lower border of the tendon of the muscle to be divided, a little behind its insertion into the sclerotic; the submucous * ' On the Obhque Muscles of the Eye in Man and Vertebrate Animals,' by John Struthers, M.D., in Anatomical and Physiological Observations.

Foster's Text-booh of Physiology.375 NASAL PiE(;iOX areolar tissue is then divided, and into the small aperture thus made, a blunt hook is passed upwards between the muscle and the globe, and the tendon of the muscle and conjunctiva covering it, divided by a pair of blunt-pointed scissors. Or the tendon may be divided by a subconjunctival incision, one blade of the scissors, being passed upwards between the tendon and the conjunctiva, and the other between the tendon and the sclerotic. The student, when dissecting these muscles, should remove on one side of the subject the conjunctiva from the front of the eye, in order to see more accurately the position of the tendons, while on the opposite side the operation may be performed. The Pyramidalis nasi is a small pyramidal slip, prolonged dow^nwwds from the Occipito-frontalis upon the side of the nose, where it becomes tendinous and blends with the Compressor nasi. As the two muscles descend, they diverge, leaving an angular interval bet^veen them. Relations.—By its upper mrface, with the skin. By its under surface, wiih the frontal and nasal bones. The Levator labii superioris alseque nasi is a thin triangular muscle, placed by the side of the nose, and extending between the inner margin of the orbit and n]jper lip. It arises by a pointed extremity from the upper part of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and passing obliquely dow^nwards and outwards, di^ides into two slips, one of which is inserted into the cartilage of the ala of the nose ; the other is prolonged into the upper lip, becoming blended with the Orbicularis oris and Levator labii superioris proprius. Eelations.—In front, with the integument; and with a small part of the Orbicularis palpebrarum above. The Dilatator naris posterior is a small muscle, which is placed partly Ijeneath the elevator of the nose and lip. It arises from the margin of the nasal notch of the superior maxilla, and from the sesamoid cartilages, and is inserted into the skin near the margin of the nostril. The Dilatator naris anterior is a thin delicate fasciculus, passing from the cartilage of the ala of the nose to the integument near its margin. This muscle is situated in front of the preceding. The Compressor nasi is a small, thin, triangular muscle, arising by its a^^ex from the superior maxillary bone, above and a little external to the incisive fossa; its fibres proceed upwards and inwards, expanding into a thin aponeurosis w-hich is attached to the fibro-cartilage of the nose, and is continuous on the bridge of the nose with that of the muscle of the opposite side, and with the aponeurosis of the Pyramidalis nasi. The Compressor narium minor is a small muscle, attached by one end to the alar cartila.^^e, and by the other to the inte.L'nment at the end of the nose. The Depressor alae nasi is a short, radiated muscle, arising from the incisive fossa of the superior maxilla ; its fibres ascend to be inserted into the septum, and back part of the ala of the nose. This muscle lies between the mucous membrane and muscular structure of the lip. Nerves.—All the muscles of this group are supplied by the facial nerve. Actions.—The Pyramidalis nasi draws down the inner angle of the eyebrows and produces transverse wrinkles over the bridge of the nose ; by some anatomists it is also considered as an elevator of the ala, and, consequently, a dilator of the nose.* The Levator labii superioris alseque nasi draws upwards the upper lip and ' Although tliis muscle anatomicallj^ seems to be a continuation of the Occipito- frontalis downwards, it is really the reverse.

The action of this muscle produces a marked influence over the countenance, and it is the principal agent in the expression of contempt and disdain. The two Dilatatores nasi enlarge the aperture of the nose. Their action in ordinary breathing is to resist the tendency of the nostrils to close from atmospheric pressure, but in difficult breathing they may be noticed to be in violent action, as well as in some emotions, as anger. The Depressor alse nasi is a direct antagonist of the other muscles of the nose, drawing the ala of the nose downwards, and thereby constricting the aperture of the nares. The Compressor nasi depresses the cartilaginous part of the nose and compresses the alse together. 6. Superior Maxillary Region (fig. 269) Levator labii superioris. Zygomaticus major. Levator anguli oris. Zygomaticus minor. The Levator labii superioris (proprius) is a thin muscle of a quadrilateral form. It arises from the lower margin of the orbit immediately above the infra-orbital foramen, some of its fibres being attached to the superior maxilla, others to the malar bone; its fibres converge to be inserted into the muscular substance of the upper lip. Relations.—By its superficial surface above, with the lower segment of the Orbicularis palpebrarum; below, it is subcutaneous. By its deei^ surface, it conceals the origin of the Compressor nasi and Levator anguli oris muscles, and the infra-orbital vessels and nerve, as they escape from the infra-orbital foramen. The Levator anguli oris arises from the canine fossa, immediately below the infra-orbital foramen ; its fibres incline downwards and a little outwards, to be inserted into the angle of the mouth, intermingling with those of the Zygomaticus major, the Depressor anguli oris, and the Orbicularis. Relations.—By its suijerficial surface, Avith the Levator labii superioris, and the infra-orbital vessels and nerves. By its deep surface, with the superior maxilla, the Buccinator, and the mucous membrane. The Zygomaticus major is a slender fasciculus, which arises from the malar bone, in front of the zygomatic suture, and descending obliquely downwards and inwards, is inserted into the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the fibres of the Levator anguli oris, the Orbicularis oris, and the Depressor anguli oris. Relations.—By its sujjcrficial surface, with the subcutaneous adipose tissue. By its deep surface, with the malar bone, and the Masseter and Buccinator muscles. The Zygomaticus minor arises from the malar bone, immediately behind the maxillary suture, and passing downwards and inwards, is continuous with the Orbicularis oris at the outer margin of the Levator labii superioris. It lies in front of the preceding. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument and the Orbicularis palpebrarum above. By its deep) surface, with the Masseter, Buccinator, and Levator anguli oris. Nerves.—This group of muscles is supplied by the facial nerve. Actions.—The Levator labii superioris is the proper elevator of the upper lip, carrying it at the same time a little forwards. It assists in forming the naso-labial ridge, which passes from the side of the nose to the upper lip and gives to the face an expression of sadness. The Levator anguli oris raises the angle of the mouth and assists the Levator labii superioris in producing the naso-labial ridge. The of the lobe of the ear, and the other (a small pointed one) be carried up and down over the nose and forehead, in the middle line, it is easy to find a nodal point of indifference, above which the Occipito-frontal draws the parts upward, and below which the Pyramidalis draws them downward.'—W. W. Keen, M.D,, American edition.377 INTERMAXILLARY REGION Zygomaticus major draws the angle of the mouth backwards and upwards, as in laughing; whilst the Zygomaticus minor, being inserted into the outer part of the upper lip and not into the angle of the mouth, draws it backwards, upwards, and outwards, and thus gives to the face an expression of sadness. 7. Inferior Maxillary Region (fig. 269) Levator labii inferioris (Levator menti). Depressor labii inferioris (Quadratus menti). Depressor anguli oris (Triangularis menti). Dissection.—The Muscles in this region may be dissected by making a vertical incision through the integument from the margin of the lower lip to the chin : a second incision should then be carried along the margin of the lower jaw as far as the angle, and the integument carefully removed in the direction shown in fi^. 268. The Levator labii inferioris (Levator menti) is to be dissected by everting the lower lip and raising the mucous membrane. It is a small conical fasciculus, placed on the side of the frsenum of the lower lip. It arises from the incisive fossa, external to the symphysis of the lower jaw : its fibres descend to be inserted into the integument of the chin. Relations.—On its inner surface, with the mucous membrane ; in the median line, it is blended with the muscle of the opposite side ; and on its outer side, with the Depressor labii inferioris. The Depressor labii inferioris (Quadratus menti) is a small quadrilateral muscle. It arises from the external oblique line of the lower jaw, between the symphysis and mental foramen, and passes obliquely upwards and inwards, to be inserted into the integument of the lower lip, its fibres blending with the Orbicularis oris, and with those of its fellow of the opposite side. It is continuous with the fibres of the Platysma at its origin. This muscle contains much yellow fat inter- mingled with its fibres. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with part of the Depressor anguli oris, and with the integument, to which it is closely connected. By its deep surface, with the mental vessels and nerves, the mucous membrane of the lower lip, the labial glands, and the Levator menti, with which it is intimately united. The Depressor anguli oris (Triangularis menti) is triangular in shape, arising, by its broad base, from the external oblique line of the lower jaw, from whence its fibres pass upwards, to be inserted, by a narrow fasciculus, into the angle of the mouth. It is continuous with the Platysma at its origin, and with the Orbicu- laris oris and Risorius at its insertion, and some of its fibres are directly continuous with those of the Levator anguli oris. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument. By its deep surface^ with the Depressor labii inferioris and Buccinator. Nerves.—This group of muscles is supplied by the facial nerve. Actions.—The Levator labii inferioris raises the lower lip, and protrudes it forwards, and at the same time wrinkles the integument of the chin, expressing doubt or disdain. The Depressor labii inferioris draws the lower lip directly downwards and a little outwards, as in the expression of irony. The Depressor anguli oris depresses the angle of the mouth, being the antagonist to the Levator anguli oris and Zygomaticus major; acting with these muscles, it will draw the angle of the mouth directly backwards. 8. Intermaxillary Region Orbicularis oris. Buccinator. Risorius. Dissection.—The dissection of these muscles may be considerably facilitated by filling the cavity of the month with tow, so as to distend the cheeks and lips; the mouth should then be closed by a few stitches, and the integument carefully removed from the surface.378 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Orbicularis oris (fig. 269) is not a sphincter muscle like the Orbicularis palpebrarum, but consists of numerous strata of muscular fibres, having different directions, which surround the orifice of the mouth. These fibres are partially derived from the other facial muscles which are inserted into the lips, and are partly fibres proper to the lips themselves. Of the former, a considerable number are derived from the Buccinator and form the deeper stratum of the Orbicularis. Some of them, namely those near the middle of the muscle, decussate at the angle of the mouth, those arising from the upper jaw passing to the lower lip, and those from the lower jaw to the upper lip. Other fibres of the muscle, situated at its upper and lower part, pass across the lips from side to side without interruption. Superficial to this stratum is a second, formed by the Levator and Depressor anguli oris, which cross each other at the angle of the mouth ; those from the Depressor passing to the upper lip, and those from the Levator to the lower lip, along which they run to be inserted into the skin near the median line. In addition to these there are fibres from the other muscles inserted into the lips, the Levator labii superioris, the Levator labii superioris alseque nasi, the Zygomatici, and the Depressor labii inferioris ; these intermingle with the transverse fibres above described, and have principally an oblique direction. The proper fibres of the lips are oblique, and pass from the under surface of the skin to the mucous membrane, through the thickness of the lip. And in addition to these are fibres by which the muscle is connected directly with the maxillary bones and the septum of the nose. These consist, in the upper lip, of four bands, two of which {Accessorii orbicularis superioris) arise from the alveolar border of the superior maxilla, opposite the lateral incisor tooth, and arching outwards on each side are continuous at the angles of the mouth with the other muscles inserted into this part. The two remaining muscular slips, called the Naso-labialis, connect the upper lip to the back of the septum of the nose : as they descend from the septum, an interval is left between them. It is this interval which forms the depression seen on the surface of the skin beneath the septum of the nose. The additional fibres for the lower segment (Accessorii orbicularis inferioris) arise from the inferior maxilla, externally to the Levator labii inferioris, and arch outwards to the angles of the mouth, to join the Buccinator and the other muscles attached to this part. Relations.—By its superficial surface^ with the integument, to which it is closely connected. By its deep surface^ with the buccal mucous membrane, the labial glands, and coronary vessels. By its outer circimiferejice, it is blended with the numerous muscles which converge to the mouth from various parts of the face. Its inner circumference is free, and covered by the mucous membrane. The Buccinator (fig. 282) is a broad, thin muscle, quadrilateral in form, which occupies the interval between the jaws at the side of the face. It arises from the outer surface of the alveolar processes of the upper and lower jaws, corresponding to the three molar teeth ; and behind, from the anterior border of the pterygo-maxillary ligament. The fibres converge towards the angle of the mouth, where the central fibres intersect each other, those from below being continuous with the upper segment of the Orbicularis oris ; and those from above with the inferior segment; the highest and lowest fibres continue forward uninter- ruptedly into the corresponding segment of the lip, without decussation. Relations.—By its superficial surface, behind, with a large mass of fat, which separates it from the ramus of the lower jaw, the Masseter, and a small portion of the Temporal muscle ; anteriorly, with the Zygomatici, Risorius, Levator anguli oris. Depressor anguli oris, and Stenson's duct, which pierces it opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw ; the facial artery and vein cross it from below upwards ; it is also crossed by the branches of the facial and buccal nerves. By its internal surface, with the buccal glands and mucous membrane of the mouth. The pterygo-maxillary ligament separates the Buccinator muscle from the Superior constrictor of the pharynx. It is a tendinous band, attached by one extremity to the apex of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the posterior extremity of the internal oblique line of the lower jaw. Its inner surface379 TEMPOKO-MAXILLAEY REGION corresponds to the cavity of the month, and is Hned by mucous membrane. Its outer surface is separated from the ramus of the jaw by a quantity of adipose tissue. Its ijosterior border gives attachment to the Superior constrictor of the pharynx ; its anterior border, to the fibres of the Buccinator (see fig. 282). The Eisorius (Santorini) (fig. 269) consists of a narrow bundle of fibres, which arises in the fascia over the Masseter muscle and, passing horizontally forwards, is inserted into the skin at the angle of the mouth. It is placed superficial to the Platysma, and is broadest at its outer extremity. This muscle varies much in its size and form. Nerves.—The Orbicularis oris and the Eisorius are supplied by the facial, the Buccinator by the facial and by the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, which latter, however, is by many anatomists regarded as a sensory nerve only. Actions.—The Orbicularis oris in its ordinary action produces the direct closure of the lips ; by its deep fibres, assisted by the oblique ones, it closely applies the lips to the alveolar arch. The superficial part, consisting principally of the decussating fibres, brings the lips together and also protrudes them forwards. The Buccinators contract and compress the cheeks, so that, during the process of mastication, the food is kept under the immediate pressure of the teeth. When the cheeks have been previously distended with air, the Buccinator muscles expel it from between the lips, as in blowing a trumpet. Hence the name [buccina, a trumpet). The Risorius retracts the angles of the mouth, and is therefore regarded as the ' smiling ' muscle. 9. Temporo-maxillaey Region Masseter. . Temporal. Masseteric Fascia.—Covering the Masseter muscle, and firmly connected with it, is a strong layer of fascia, derived from the deep cervical fascia. Above, this fascia is attached to the lower border of the zygoma, and behind it covers the parotid gland, constituting the ijarotid fascia. The Masseter is exposed by the removal of this fascia (fig. 269); it is a short, thick muscle, somewhat quadrilateral in form, consisting of two portions, super- ficial and deep. The superficial portion, the larger, arises by a thick, tendinous aponeurosis from the malar process of the superior maxilla, and from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch: its fibres pass downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the angle and lower half of the outer surface of the ramus of the jaw. The deep portion is much smaller, and more muscular in texture; it arises from the posterior third of the lower border and the whole of the inner surface of the zygomatic arch ; its fibres pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the upper half of the ramus and outer surface of the coronoid process of the jaw. The deep portion of the muscle is partly concealed, in front, by the superficial portion ; behind, it is covered by the parotid gland. The fibres of the two portions are united at their insertion. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Zygomatici, the Socia parotidis, and Stenson's duct ; the branches of the facial nerve and the transverse facial vessels, which cross it; the masseteric fascia; the Risorius Santorini, Platysma myoides, and the integument. By its deep surface, with the Temporal muscle at its insertion, the ramus of the jaw, and the Buccinator, from which it is separated by a mass of fat. The masseteric nerve and artery enter it on its under surface. Its posterior margin is overlapped by the parotid gland. Its anterior margin projects over the Buccinator muscle ; and the facial vein lies on it below. The temporal fascia is seen, at this stage of the dissection, covering in the Temporal muscle. It is a strong, fibrous investment, covered, on its outer surface, by the Attrahens and AttoUens aurem muscles, the aponeurosis of the Occipito- frontalis, and by part of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. The temporal vessels and the auriculo-temporal nerve cross it from below uiDwards. Above, it is a singleMUSCLES AND FASCIA 38o layer, attached to the entu^e extent of the upper temporal ridge; but below, where it is attached to the zygoma, it consists of two layers, one of which is inserted into the outer, and the other into the inner border of the zygomatic arch. A small quantity of fat, the orbital branch of the temporal artery, and a filament from the orbital, or temporo-malar, branch of the superior maxillary nerve, are contained between these two layers. It affords attachment by its inner surface to the superficial fibres of the Temporal muscle. Dissection.—In order to expose the Temporal muscle, remove the temporal fascia, which may be effected by separating it at its attachment along the upper border of the zygoma, and dissecting it upwards from the surface of the muscle. The zygomatic arch should then be divided, in front, at its junction with the malar bone ; and, behind, near the external auditory meatus, and drawn downwards with the Masseter, which should be detached from its insertion into the ramus and angle of the jaw. The whole extent of the Temporal muscle is then exposed. The Temporal (fig. 273) is a broad, radiating muscle, situated at the side of the head, and occupying the entire extent of the temporal fossa. It arises from the whole of the temporal fossa except that portion of it that is formed by the malar bone. Its attachment extends from the external angular process of the frontal in Fig. 273.—The Temporal muscle, the zygoma and Masseter having been removed. front, to the mastoid portion of the temporal behind ; and from the curved line on the frontal and parietal bones above, to the pterygoid ridge on the great wing of the sphenoid below. It is also attached to the inner surface of the temporal fascia. Its fibres converge as they descend, and terminate in an aponeurosis, the fibres of which, radiated at its commencement, converge into a thick and flat tendon, which is inserted into the inner surface, apex, and anterior border of the coronoid process of the jaw, nearly as far forwards as the last molar tooth. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument, the Attrahens and Attollens aurem muscles, the temporal vessels and nerves, the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis, the temporal fascia, the zygoma, and Masseter. By its deep surface, with the temporal fossa, the External pterygoid and part of the Buccinator muscles, the internal maxillary artery, its deep temporal branches, and the deep temporal nerves. Behind the tendon are the masseteric vessels and nerve, and in front of it the buccal vessels and nerve. Its anterior border is separated from the malar bone by a mass of fat. Nerves.—Both muscles are supplied by the inferior maxillary nerve.381 PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION 10. Pteeygo-maxillaey Region (fig. 274) External Pterygoid. Internal Pterygoid. Dissection.—The Temporal muscle having been examined, saw through the base of the coronoid process, and draw it upwards, together with the Temporal muscle, which should be detached from the surface of the temporal fossa. Divide the ramus of the jaw just below the condyle, and also, by a transverse incision extending across the middle, just above the dental foramen; remove the fragment, and the Pterygoid muscles will be exposed. The External Pterygoid is a short, thick muscle, somewhat conical in form, which extends almost horizontally between the zygomatic fossa and the condyle of the jaw. It arises from the pterygoid ridge on the great wing of the sphenoid, and the portion of bone included between it and the base of the pterygoid process and from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate. Its fibres pass horizontally backwards and outwards, to be inserted into a depression in front of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, and into the corresponding part of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. This muscle, at its origin, appears to consist of two Fig. 274.—The Pterygoid muscles-; the zygomatic arch and a portion of the ramus of the jaw having been removed. portions separated by a slight interval; henoe the terms tii^per and loioer head, sometimes used in the description of the muscle. Relations.—By its external surface, with the ramus of the lower jaw, the internal maxillary artery, which crosses it,* the tendon of the Temporal muscle, and the Masseter. By its internal surface, it rests against the upper part of the Internal pterygoid, the internal lateral ligament, the middle meningeal artery, and inferior maxillary nerve ; by its tipper border it is in relation with the temporal and masseteric branches of the inferior maxillary nerve ; by its lower border it is in relation with the inferior dental and gustatory nerves, and it is pierced by the buccal nerve. In the interval between the two portions of the muscle the internal maxillary artery passes, when this vessel lies on the muscle (see fig. 274). The Internal Pterygoid is a thick, quadrilateral muscle, and resembles the Masseter in form. It arises from the pterygoid fossa, being attached to the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate, and to the grooved surface of the tuberosity * This is the usual relation, but in many cases the artery will be found below the muscle.382 MUSCLES AND FASCIA of the palate bone, and by a second slip from the outer surface of the tuberosity of the palate bone, and from the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone ; its fibres pass downwards, outwards, and backwards, to be inserted, by a strong, tendinous lamina into the low^er and back part of the inner side of the ramus and angle of the lower jaw, as high as the dental foramen. Relations.—By its external surface, with the ramus of the lower jaw, from which it is separated, at its upper part, by the External pterygoid, the internal lateral ligament, the internal maxillary artery, the dental vessels and nerves, and the lingual nerve. By its internal surface, with the Tensor palati, being separated from the Superior constrictor of the pharynx by a cellular interval. Nerves.—These muscles are supplied by the inferior maxillary nerve. Actions.—The Temporal and Masseter and Internal pterygoid raise the lower jaw against the upper with great force. The superficial portion of the Masseter assists the External pterygoid in drawing the lower jaw forwards upon the upper, the jaw being drawn back again by the deep fibres of the Masseter, and posterior fibres of the Temporal. The External pterygoid muscles are the direct agents in the trituration of the food, drawing the lower jaAV directly forwards, so as to make the lower teeth project beyond the upper. If the muscle of one side acts, the corresponding side of the jaw is drawn forwards, and the other condyle remaining fixed, the symphysis deviates to the opposite side. The alternation of these movements on the two sides produces trituration. Surface Form.—The outline of the muscles of the head and face cannot be traced on the surface of the body, except in the case of two of the masticatory muscles. Those of the head are thin, so that the outline of the bone is perceptible beneath them. Those in the face are small, covered by soft skin, and often by a considerable layer of fat, so that their outline is concealed; but they serve to round off and smooth prominent borders, and to fill up what would be otherwise unsightly angular depressions. Thus, the Orbicularis palpebrarum rounds off the prominent margin of the orbit, and the Pyramiclalis nasi fills in the sharp depression beneath the glabella, and thus softens and tones down the abrupt depres- sion which is seen on the unclothed bone. In like manner, the labial muscles, converging to the lips, and assisted by the superimposed fat, fill in the sunken hollow of the lower part of the face. Although the muscles of the face are usually described as arising from the bones, and inserted into the nose, lips, and corners of the mouth, they have fibres inserted into the skin of the face along their whole extent, so that almost every point of the skin of the face has its muscular fibre to move it; hence it is that when in action the facial muscles produce alterations in the skin-surface, giving rise to the formation of various folds or wrinkles, or otherwise altering the relative position of parts, so as to produce the varied expressions with which the face is endowed; hence these muscles are termed the ' Muscles of expression.' The only two muscles in this region which greatly influence surface-form are the Masseter and the Temporal. The Masseter is a quadrilateral muscle, which impa^rts fulness to the hinder part of the cheek. When the muscle is firmly contracted, as when the teeth are clenched, its outline is plainly visible ; the anterior border forms a prominent vertical ridge, behind which is a considerable fulness, especially marked at the lower part of the muscle ; this fulness is entirely lost when the mouth is opened, and the muscle no longer in a state of contraction. The Temporal muscle is fan-shaped, and fills the Temporal fossa, substituting for it a some- what convex form, the anterior part of which, on account of the absence of hair over the temple, is more marked than the posterior, and stands out in strong relief when the muscle is in a state of contraction.

Included in the description of the Larynx, I. Superficial Cekvical Region Platysma myoides. Sterno-cleido-mastoid. Dissection.—A block having been placed at the back of the neck, and the face turned to the side opposite that to be dissected, so as to place the parts upon the stretch, make two transverse incisions : one from the chin, along the margin of the lower jaw, to the mastoid process; and the other along the upper border of the clavicle. Connect these by an oblique incision made in the course of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, from the mastoid process to the sternum; the two flaps of integument having been removed in the direction shown in fig. 268, the superficial fascia will be exposed. The Superficial Cervical Fascia is a thin, aponeurotic lamina, which is hardly demonstrable as a separate membrane. Beneath it is found the Platysma myoides muscle. The Platysma myoides (fig. 269) is a broad, thin plane of muscular fibres, placed immediately beneath the superficial fascia on each side of the neck. It arises by thin, fibrous bands from the fascia covering the upper part of the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles ; its fibres proceed obliquely upwards and inwards along the side of the neck. The anterior fibres interlace, in front of the jaw, with the fibres of the muscle of the opposite side; the posterior fibres pass over the lower jaw, a few of them being attached to the bone below the external oblique line, the greater number passing on to be inserted into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower part of the face, many of these fibres blending with the muscles about the angle and lower part of the mouth. Sometimes fibres can be traced to the Zygomatic muscles, or to the margin of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. Beneath the Platysma, the external jugular vein may be seen descending from the angle of the jaw to the clavicle.384 MUSCLES AND FASCIA Surgical Anatomy.—It is essential to remember the direction of the fibres of the Platysma, in connection with the operation of bleeding from the external jugular vein ; for if the point of the lancet is introduced in the direction of the muscular fibres, the orifice made will be filled up by the contraction of the muscle, and blood will not fiow ; but if the incision is made across the course of the fibres, they will retract, and expose the orifice in the vein, and so allow the flow of blood. Relations.—By its external surface, with the integument, to which it is united more closely below than above. By its internal surface, with the Pectoralis major, Deltoid, and Trapezius, and with the clavicle. In the neck, w^ith the external and anterior jugular veins, the deep cervical fascia, the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, the Sterno-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, Omo-hyoid, and Digastric muscles. Behind the Sterno-mastoid muscle, it covers the Scaleni muscles and the nerves of the brachial plexus. On the face, it is in relation with the parotid gland, the facial artery and vein, and the Masseter and Buccinator muscles. Action.—The Platysma myoides produces a slight wrinkling of the surface of the skin of the neck, in an oblique direction, when the entire muscle is brought into action. Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw ; it also serves to draw down the lower lip and angle of the mouth on each side, being one of the chief agents in the expression of melancholy. The Deep Cervical Fascia (fig. 275) is a strong, fibrous layer, which invests the muscles of the neck, and encloses the vessels and nerves. It commences, as an extremely thin layer, at the back part of the neck, where it is attached to the ligamentum nuch^e and to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebrae, and, passing forwards, invests the Trapezius muscle; from the anterior border of this muscle it forms a layer, which covers in the posterior triangle of the neck; and, passing forwards to the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, divides into two layers, one of which passes in front, and the other behind, that muscle. The layer which passes in front of. the muscle is continued forwards to the front of the neck, and blends with the fascia of the opposite side, covering the anterior triangle. It is joined on its under surface, except for about an inch below, by a lamella derived from the layer covering the posterior surface of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. Where these two layers do not meet, a little space is left between them, as they both pass inwards to the middle line of the neck. This is Burns's sxjace, and contains a little areolar tissue and fat, and occasionally a small lymphatic gland. If traced upwards, the anterior layer of the cervical fascia is found to pass across the parotid gland and Masseter muscle, forming the iKtroticl and masseteric fasci(B, and is attached to the low^er border of the zygoma, and, more anteriorly, to the lower border of the body of the jaw ; if traced downwards, it is seen to pass to the upper border of the clavicle and sternum, being pierced just above the former bone by the external jugular vein. In the middle line of the neck, the fascia is connected to the symphysis of the inferior maxilla, and, lower down, to the hyoid bone, between which points it is thin ; below the hyoid bone it becomes thicker, and is attached below to the anterior margin of the upper border of the sternum. The layer of the deep cervical fascia which passes behind the Sterno-mastoid covers the anterior surface of the Scalenus anticus muscle. At the outer side of the carotid vessels it divides into two, one layer passing in front of the vessels, the other behind them. The layer which passes in front of the vessels again divides into three lamellae. Of these, the anterior lamella, except for an inch below where it forms the posterior boundary of Burns's space, joins the layer of cervical fascia passing in front of the Sterno-mastoid, and w4th it passes to the middle line covering the anterior surface of the Depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. The portion of this lamella which invests the Omo-hyoid is continued downwards as a distinct process, which descends to be inserted into the sternum and cartilage of the first rib, and becomes connected with the Costo-coracoid membrane. The middle lamella passes behind the depressors of the hyoid bone and in front of the thyroid body to meet its fellow of the opposite side, in front of the trachea. At385 SUPEEFICIAL CERVICAL EEGION the root of the neck this middle lamella can be traced downwards into the thorax to become continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The posterior lamella passes on the inner side of the carotid vessels, and speedily joins the layer passing- behind them, thus enclosing them in a sheath. The layer of cervical fascia which passes behind the carotid vessels, having been joined by the posterior of the three lamellae from the layer of fascia passing in front of the vessels, is prolonged inwards, behind the pharynx and oesophagus, forming a sheath for the Prevertebral muscles, the prevertebral fascia. The layer of the deep cervical Fig. 275.—Section of the neck at about the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. Showing the arrangement of the deep cervical fascia. fascia, which passes behind the Sterno-mastoid, gives off another lamella which passes downwards and outwards over the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, to assist in forming the axillary sheath. The two layers of the deep cervical fascia, where they unite opposite the angle of the lower jaw, bind the Sterno-mastoid muscle to this part of the bone. From that portion of the cervical fascia which is attached to the angle of the jaw, a process of extreme density is found passing behind to the inner side of the parotid gland, to be attached to the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone ; this is termed the Stylo-maxillary ligament. CC386 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Sterno-mastoid, or Sterno-cleido-mastoid (fig. 276) is a large, thick muscle, which passes obliquely across the side of the neck, being enclosed between the two layers of the deep cervical fascia. It is thick and narrow at its central part, but is broader and thinner at each extremity. It arises, by two heads, from the sternum and clavicle. The stemal portion is a rounded fasciculus, tendinous in front, fleshy behind, which arises from the upper and anterior part of the first piece of the sternum, and is directed upwards, outwards, and backwards. The clavicular loor- tion arises from the inner third of the superior border of the clavicle, being composed of fleshy and aponeurotic fibres ; it is directed almost vertically upwards. These two portions are separated from one another, at their origin, by a triangular cellular interval; but become gradually blended, below the middle of the neck, Fig. 276.—Muscles of the neck, and boundaries of the triangles. into a thick, rounded muscle, which is inserted, by a strong tendon, into the outer surface of the mastoid process, from its apex to its superior border, and by a thin aponeurosis into the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. The Sterno-mastoid varies much in its extent of attachment to the clavicle: in one case the clavicular may be as narrow as the sternal portion; in another, as much as three inches in breadth. When the clavicular origin is broad, it is occasionally subdivided into numerous slips, separated by narrow intervals. More rarely, the corresponding margins of the Sterno-mastoid and Trapezius have been found in contact. In the application of a ligature to the third part of the subclavian artery, it will be necessary, where the muscles come close together, to divide a portion of one or of both. This muscle divides the quadrilateral space at the side of the neck into two triangles, an anterior and a posterior. The boundaries of the anterior triangle are, in front, the median line of the neck; above, the lower border of the body of the jaw, and an imaginary line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid387 INFRA-HYOID REGION process ; behind, the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The boundaries of the posterior triangle are, in front, the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid; below, the upper border of the clavicle ; behind, the anterior margin of the Trapezius.* Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument and Platysma, from which it is separated by the external jugular vein, the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. By its deep surface, it is in relation with the Sterno-clavicular articulation ; a process of the deep cervical fascia ; the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Omo-hyoid, posterior belly of the Digastric, Levator anguli scapulae, Splenius and Scaleni muscles ; common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, commencement of the internal and external carotid arteries, the occipital, subclavian, transversalis colli and supra- scapular arteries and veins; the pneumogastric, hypoglossal, descendens and communicans hypogiossi nerves and the spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper third; the cervical plexus, part of the parotid gland and deep lymphatic glands. Nerves.—The Platysma myoides is supplied by the facial and superficial branches of the cervical plexus ; the Sterno-cleido-mastoid by the spinal accessory and deep branches of the cervical plexus. Actions.—When only one Sterno-mastoid muscle acts, it flexes the head and draws it towards the shoulder of the same side, assisted by the Splenius and the Obliquus capitis inferior of the opposite side. At the same time it rotates the head so as to carry the face towards the opposite side. When both muscles are brought into action, they serve to depress the head upon the neck, and the neck upon the chest. If the head is fixed, they assist in elevating the thorax in forced inspiration. Surface Form — The anterior edge of the muscle forms a very prominent ridge beneath the skin, which it is important to notice, as it forms a guide to the surgeon in making the necessary incisions for ligature of the common carotid artery, and for cesophagotoniy. • Surgical Anatomij.—The relations of the sternal and clavicular parts of the Sterno- mastoid should be carefully examined, as the surgeon is sometimes required to divide one or both portions of the muscles inwry-neclt. One variety of this distortion is produced by spasmodic contraction or rigidity of the Sterno-mastoid ; the head being carried down towards the shoulder of the same side, and the face turned to the opposite side, and fixed in that position. When there is permanent shortening, subcutaneous division of the muscle is resorted to. This is performed by introducing a tenotomy knife beneath it, close to its origin, and dividing it from behind forwards whilst the muscle is put well upon the stretch. There is seldom any difficulty in dividing the sternal portion, by making a puncture on the inner side of the tendon, and then pushing a blunt tenotome behind it, and cutting forwards. In dividing the clavicular portion care must be taken to avoid wounding the external jugular vein, which runs parallel with the posterior border of the muscle in this situation, or the anterior jugular vein, which crosses beneath it. If the external jugular vein lies near the muscle, it is safer to make the first puncture at the outer side of the tendon, and introduce a blunt tenotome from without inwards. Some of the fibres of the Sterno-mastoid muscle are occasionally torn during birth, especially in breech presentations ; this is accompanied by hsemorrhage and formation of a swelling within the substance of the muscle. This by some is believed to be one of the causes of wry-neck. 2. Infea-hyoid Region (figs. 276, 277) Depeessoes of the Os Hyoides and Laeynx Sterno-hyoid. Thyro-hyoid. Sterno-thyroid. Omo-hyoid. Dissection.—The muscles in this region may be exposed by removing the deep fascia from the front of the neck. In order to see the entire extent of the Omo-hyoid, it is necessary to divide the Sterno-mastoid at its centre, and turn its ends aside, and to detach the Trapezius from the clavicle and scapula. This, however, should not be done until the Trapezius has been dissected, * The anatomy of these triangles will be more exactly described with that of the vessels of the neck. c c 2388 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Sterno-hyoid is a thin, narrow, riband-Uke muscle, which arises from the inner extremity of the clavicle, and the upper and posterior part of the first piece of the sternum; passing upAvards and inwards, it is inserted, by short, tendinous fibres, into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides. This muscle is separated, below, from its fellow by a considerable interval; but they approach one another in the middle of their course, and again diverge as they ascend. It sometimes presents, immediately above its origin, a transverse tendinous intersection, like those in the Eectus abdominis. Relations.—By its suj^erficial surface, below, with the sternum, the sternal end of the clavicle, and the Sterno-mastoid; and above, with the Platysma and deep cervical fascia. By its deejJ surface, with the Sterno-thyroid, Crico-thyroid, and Thyro-hyoid muscles, the thyroid gland, the superior thyroid vessels, the thyroid cartilage, the crico-thyroid and thyro-hyoid membranes. The Sterno-thyroid is situated beneath the preceding muscle, but is shorter and wider than it. It arises from the posterior surface of the first bone of the sternum, below the origin of the Sterno-hyoid, and from the edge of the cartilage of the first rib ; and is inserted into the oblique line on the side of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. This muscle is in close contact with its fellow at the lower part of the neck ; and is occasionally traversed by a transverse or oblique tendinous intersection like those in the Rectus abdominis. Relations.—By its anterior sitrface, with the Sterno-hyoid, Omo-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid. By its posterior surface, from below upwards, with the trachea vena innominata, common carotid (and on the right side the arteria innominata), the thyroid gland and its vessels, and the lower part of the larynx. The middle thyroid vein lies along its inner border, a relation which it is important to remember in the operation of tracheotomy.SUPRA-HYOID REGION 389 The Thyro-hyoid is a small, quadrilateral muscle appearing like a continuation of the Sterno-thyroid. It arises from the oblique line on the side of the thyroid cartilage, and passes vertically upwards to be inserted into the lower border of the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone. Relations.—By its external surface, with the Sterno-hyoid and Omo-hyoid muscles. By its internal surface, with the thyroid cartilage, the thyro-hyoid membrane, and the superior laryngeal vessels and nerve. The Omo-hyoid passes across the side of the neck, from the scapula to the hyoid bone. It consists of two fleshy bellies, united by a central tendon. It arises from the upper border of the scapula, and occasionally from the transverse ligament which crosses the suprascapular notch ; its extent of attachment to the scapula varying from a few lines to an inch. From this origin, the posterior belly forms a flat, narrow fasciculus, which inclines forwards and slightly upwards across the lower part of the neck, behind the Sterno-mastoid muscle, where it becomes tendinous ; it then changes its direction, forming an obtuse angle, and terminates in the anterior belly, which passes almost vertically upwards, close to the outer border of the Sterno-hyoid, to be inserted into the lower border of the body of the os hyoides, just external to the insertion of the Sterno-hyoid. The central tendon of this muscle, which varies much in length and form, is held in position by a process of the deep cervical fascia, which includes it in a sheath. This process is prolonged down, to be attached to the cartilage of the first rib and the sternum. It is by this means that the angular form of the muscle is main- tained. This muscle subdivides each of the two large triangles at the side of the neck into two smaller triangles; the two posterior ones being the posterior superior or occipital, and the posterior inferior or subclavian; the two anterior, the anterior superior or superior carotid, and the anterior inferior or inferior carotid triangle. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Trapezius, the Sterno-mastoid, deep cervical fascia, Platysma, and integument. By its deep surface, with the Scaleni muscles, phrenic nerve, lower cervical nerves, which go to form the brachial plexus, the suprascapular vessels and nerve, sheath of the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, the Sterno-thyroid and Thyro-hyoid-muscles. Nerves.—^The Thyro-hyoid is supplied by the hypoglossal; the other muscles of this group by branches from the loop of communication between the descendens and communicans hypoglossi. Actions.—These muscles depress the larynx and hyoid bone, after they have been drawn up with the pharynx in the act of deglutition. The Omo-hyoid muscles not only depress the hyoid bone, but carry it backwards, and to one or the other side. It is concerned especially in the act of sucking ; and is also a tensor of the cervical fascia. The Thyro-hyoid may act as an elevator of the thyroid cartilage, when the hyoid bone ascends, drawing upwards the thyroid cartilage, behind the os hyoides.* The Sterno-thyroid acts as a depressor of the thyroid cartilage. 3.

It is a small muscle, situated below the side of the body of the lower * It is this action of the Thyro-hyoid muscle which, as Dr. Buchanan has pointed out, ' causes or permits the folding back of the epiglottis over the upper orifice of the larynx.'

The ijosterior belly, longer than the anterior, arises from the digastric groove on the inner side of the mastoid jDrocess of the temporal bone, and passes downwards, forwards, and inwards. The anterior belly arises from a depression on the inner side of the lower border of the jaw, close to the symphysis, and passes downwards and backwards. The two bellies terminate in the central tendon which perforates the Stylo-hyoid, and is held in connection with the side of the body and the greater cornu of the hyoid bone by a fibrous loop, lined by a synovial membrane. A broad aponeurotic layer is given off from the tendon of the Digastric on each side, which is attached to the body and great cornu of the hyoid bone : this is termed the supra-hyoid aijoneurosis. It forms a strong layer of fascia between the anterior portion of the two muscles, and a firm investment for the other muscles of the supra-hyoid region which lie deeper. The Digastric muscle divides the anterior superior triangle of the neck into two smaller triangles; the upper, or submaxillary, being bounded, above, by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and a line drawn from its angle to the mastoid process ; below, by the posterior belly of the Digastric and the Stylo- hyoid muscles; in front, by the middle line of the neck, and anterior belly of the Digastric : the lower or stqyerior carotid triangle being bounded above by the posterior belly of the Digastric, behind by the Sterno-mastoid, below by the Omo- hyoid. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Platysma, Sterno-mastoid, X3art of the Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and the parotid gland. By its deep surface, the anterior belly lies on the Mylo-hyoid; the posterior belly on the Stylo-glossus, Stylo-pharyngeus, and Hyo-giossus muscles, the external carotid artery and its lingual and facial branches, the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and hypoglossal nerve. The Stylo-hyoid is a small, slender muscle, lying in front of, and above, the posterior belly of the Digastric. It arises from the back and outer surface of the styloid process, near the base ; and, passing downwards and forwards, is inserted into the body of the hyoid bone, just at its junction with the greater cornu, and immediately above the Omo-hyoid. This muscle is perforated, near its insertion, by the tendon of the Digastric. Relations.—The relations are the same as those of the posterior belly of the Digastric. The Stylo-hyoid Ligament.—In connection with the Stylo-hyoid muscle may be described a ligamentous band, the Stylo-hyoid ligament. It is a fibrous cord, often containing a little cartilage in its centre, which continues the styloid process down to the hyoid bone, being attached to the tip of the former and the small cornu of the latter. It is often more or less ossified. The Digastric and Stylo-hyoid should be removed, in order to expose the next muscle. The Mylo-hyoid is a flat, triangular muscle, situated immediately beneath the anterior belly of the Digastric, and forming, with its fellow of the opposite side, a muscular floor for the cavity of the mouth. It arises from the whole length of the mylo-hyoid ridge, extending from the symphysis in front to the last molar tooth behind. The posterior fibres pass obliquely forwards, to be inserted into the body of the os hyoides. The middle and anterior fibres are inserted into a median fibrous raphe, extending from the symphysis of the lower jaw to the hyoid bone, where they join at an angle with the fibres of the opposite muscle. This median raphe is sometimes wanting ; the muscular fibres of the two sides are then directly continuous with one another. Relations.—By its cutaneous surface, with the Platysma, the anterior belly of the Digastric, the supra-hyoid aponeurosis, the submaxillary gland, submental vessels, and mylo-hyoid vessels and nerve. By its deep or superior surface, with the Genio-hyoid, part of the Hyo-giossus, and Stylo-giossus muscles, the hypo- glossal and lingual nerves, the submaxillary ganglion, the sublingual gland, theLINGUAL EEGION 391 deep portion of the submaxillary gland and Wharton's duct; the sublingual and ranine vessels, and the buccal mucous membrane. Dissection—The Mylo-hyoid should now be removed, in order to expose the muscles which lie beneath ; this is effected by detaching it from its attachments to the hyoid bone and jaw, and separating it by a vertical incision from its fellow of the opposite side. The Genio-hyoid is a narrow, slender muscle, situated immediately beneath* the inner border of the preceding. It arises from the inferior genial tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the jaw, and passes downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the anterior surface of the body of the os hyoides. This muscle lies in close contact with its fellow of the opposite side, and increases slightly in breadth as it descends. Relations.—It is covered by the Mylo-hyoid, and lies on the Genio-hyo-giossus. Nerves.—The Digastric is supplied : its anterior belly, by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental; its posterior belly, by the facial ; the Stylo-hyoid, by the facial; the Mylo-hyoid, by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental; the Genio-hyoid, by the hypoglossal. Actions.—This group of muscles performs two very important actions. They raise the hyoid bone, and with it the base of the tongue, during the act of degluti- tion ; or, when the hyoid bone is fixed by its depressors and those of the larynx, they depress the lower jaw. During the first act of deglutition, when the mass is being driven from the mouth into the pharynx, the hyoid bone, and with it the tongue, is carried upwards and forwards by the anterior belly of the Digastric, the Mylo-hyoid, and Genio-hyoid muscles. In the second act, when the mass is passing through the pharynx, the direct elevation of the hyoid bone takes place by the combined action of all the muscles ; and after the food has passed, the hyoid bone is carried upwards and backwards by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, which assist in preventing the return of the morsel into the mouth. Dissection.—After completing the dissection of the preceding muscles, saw through the lower jaw just external to the symphysis. Then draw the tongue forwards, and attach it, by a stitch, to the nose ; when its muscles, which are thus put on the stretch, may be examined. The Genio-hyo-glossus has received its name from its triple attachment to the jaw, hyoid bone, and tongue, but it would be better named the Genio-glossus, since its attachment to the hyoid bone is very slight or altogether absent. It is a flat, triangular muscle, placed vertically on either side of the middle line, its apex corresponding with its point of attachment to the lower jaw, its base with its insertion into the tongue and hyoid bone. It arises by a short tendon from the superior genial tubercle on the inner side of the symphysis of the jaw, immediately above the Genio-hyoid ; from this point the muscle spreads out in a fan-like form, a few of the inferior fibres passing downwards, to be attached by a thin aponeurosis into the upper part of the body of the hyoid bone ; the middle fibres passing back- wards, and the superior ones upwards and forwards, to enter the whole length of the under surface of the tongue, from the base to the apex. The two muscles lie on either side of the median plane; behind, they are quite distinct from each other, and are separated at their insertion into the under surface of the tongue by a tendinous raphe, which extends through the middle of the organ ; in front, the two muscles are more or less blended: distinct fasciculi are to be seen passing off from one muscle, crossing the middle line, and intersecting with bundles of fibres derived from the muscle on the other side (fig. 279). * This refers to the depth of the muscles from the skin in the order of dissection. In the erect position of the body each of these muscles lies above the preceding. 4. Lingual Eegion Genio-hyo-glossus. Hyo-glossus. Stylo-giossus. Palato-glossus.

By its upper border, with the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth (frsenum linguaB). By its loioer border, with the Genio-hyoid.

By its deep surface, with the Stylo-hyoid ligament, the Genio-hyo-giossus, Lingualis, and Middle constrictor, the lingual vessels, and the giosso-pharyngeal nerve. The Chondro-glossus is a distinct muscular slip, about three-quarters to an inch in length, which arises from the inner side and base of the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone and contiguous portion of the body of the bone, and passes directly upwards to blend Avith the intrinsic muscular fibres of the tongue, between the Hyo-glossus and Genio-hyo-giossus. A small slip of muscular fibre is occasionally found, arising from the cartilago triticea in the thyro-hyoid ligament, and passing upwards and forwards to enter the tongue with the hindermost fibres of the Hyo-glossus. The Stylo-glossns, the shortest and smallest of the three styloid muscles, arises from the anterior and outer side of the styloid process, near its apex, and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, to which its fibres, in most cases, are attached by a thin393 LINGUAL REGION CHONDRO-GUOSSUS Fig. 279.— Muscles of the tongue from below.

Passing downwards and forwards between the internal and external carotid arteries, and becoming nearly horizontal in its direction, it divides upon the side of the tongue into two portions : one longitudinal, which enters the side of the tongue near its dorsal surface, blending with the fibres of the Lingualis in front of the Hyo-glossus ; the other oblique, which overlaps the Hyo-glossus muscle and decussates with its fibres. Relations.—By its external surface, from above downwards, with the parotid gland, the Internal pterygoid muscle, the lingual nerve, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. By its internal surface, with the tonsil, the Superior constrictor, and the Hyo-glossus muscle. The Palato-glossus, or Constrictor isthmi faucium, although it is one of the muscles of the tongue, serving to draw its base upwards during the act of de- glutition, is more nearly associated with the soft palate, both in its situation and function; it will, consequently, be de- scribed with that group of muscles. Nerves.—The Palato-glossus is loro- bably innervated by the spinal accessory nerve, through the pharyngeal plexus ; the Inferior lingualis, according to some authors, by the chorda tympani; the re- maining muscles of this group by the hypoglossal. Muscular Substance of Tongue.—The muscular fibres of the tongue run in various directions. These fibres are divided into two sets—Extrinsic and In- trinsic. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue are those which have their origin external and only their terminal fibres contained in the substance of the organ. They are : the Stylo-glossus, the Hyo- glossus, the Palato-glossus, the Genio- hyo-glossus, and part of the Superior constrictor of the pharynx (Pharyngeo- glossus). The intrinsic are those which are contained entirely within the tongue, and form the greater part of its muscular structure. The tongue consists of symmetrical halves separated from each other in the middle line by a fibrous septum. Each half is composed of muscular fibres arranged in various directions, containing much interposed fat, and supplied by vessels and nerves. To demonstrate the various fibres of the tongue, the organ should be subjected to prolonged boiling, in order to soften the connective tissue ; the dissection may then be commenced from the dorsum (fig, 280). Immediately beneath the mucous membrane is a submucous, fibrous layer, into which the muscular fibres which terminate on the surface of the tongue are inserted. Upon removing this, with the mucous membrane, the first stratum of muscular fibres is exposed. This belongs to the group of intrinsic muscles, and has been named the Su]jerior lingualis. It consists of a thin layer of oblique and longitudinal fibres, which arise from the submucous fibrous layer, close to the Epiglottis, and from the fibrous septum, and jd^ss forwards and outwards to the edges of the tongue. Between its fibres pass some vertical fibres derived from the Genio-hyo-glossus394 MUSCLES AND FASCIA and from the vertical intrinsic muscle, which will be described later on. Beneath this layer is the second stratmii of muscular fibres, derived principally from the extrinsic muscles. In front, it is formed by the fibres derived from the Stylo-glossus, running along the side of the tongue, and sending one set of fibres over the dorsum which runs obliquely forwards and inwards to the middle line, and another set of fibres, seen at a later period of the dissection, on to the under surface of the sides of the anterior part of the tongue, which run forwards and inwards, between the fibres of the Hyo-giossus, to the middle line. Behind this layer of fibres, derived from the Stylo-glossus, are fibres derived from the Hyo-giossus, assisted by some few fibres of the Palato-giossus. The Hyo-giossus, entering the side of the under surface of the tongue, between the Stylo-glossus and Inferior lingualis, passes round its margin and spreads out into a layer on the dorsum, which occupies the middle third of the organ, and runs almost transversely inwards to the septum. It is reinforced by some fibres from the Palato-giossus ; other fibres of this muscle pass more deeply and intermingle with the next layer.

I Old edge of SujjrrficiaJ lingualis second layer of the muscular fibres of the tongue is derived from those fibres of the Hyo-giossus which arise from the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone, and are here described as a separate muscle—the Chondro-glossus. The fibres of this muscle are arranged in a fan-shaped manner, and spread out over the posterior third of the tongue. Beneath this layer is the great mass of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue, intersected at right angles by the terminal fibres of one of the extrinsic muscles—the Genio-hyo-glossus. This portion of the tongue is paler in colour and softer in texture than that already described, and is sometimes designated the medullary portion in contradistinction to the firmer superficial part, which is termed the cortical portion. It consists largely of transverse fibres, the Transverse lingualis, and of vertical fibres, the Vertical lingualis. The Transverse lingualis forms the largest portion of the third layer of muscular fibres of the395 LINGUAL REGION tongue. The fibres arise from the median septum, and pass outwards to be inserted into the submucous fibrous layer at the sides of the tongue. Intermingled with these transverse intrinsic fibres are transverse extrinsic fibres derived from the Palato-glossus and the Superior constrictor of the pharynx. These transverse extrinsic fibres, however, run in the opposite direction, passing inwards towards the septum. Intersecting the transverse fibres are a large number of vertical fibres derived partly from the Genio-hyo-glossus and partly from vertical intrinsic fibres, the Vertical lingualis. The fibres derived from the Genio-hyo-glossus enter the under surface of the tongue on each side of the median septum from base to apex. They ascend in a radiating manner to the dorsum, being inserted into the sub- mucous fibrous layer covering the tongue on each side of the middle line. The Vertical lingualis is found only at the borders of the fore part of the tongue, external to the fibres of the Genio-hyo-glossus. Its fibres extend from the upper to the under surface of the tongue, decussating with the fibres of the other muscles and especially with the Transverse lingualis. The fourth layer of muscular fibres of the tongue consists partly of extrinsic fibres derived from the Stylo-glossus, and partly of intrinsic fibres, the Inferior lingualis. At the sides of the under surface of the tongue are some fibres derived from the Stylo-glossus, which, as it runs forwards at the side of the tongue, gives off fibres which, passing forwards and inwards between the fibres of the Hyo-glossus, form an inferior oblique stratum which joins in front with the anterior fibres of the Inferior lingualis. The Inferior lingualis is a longi- tudinal band, situated on the under surface of the tongue, lying in the interval between the'^Stylo-glossus, in front of the Hyo-glossus and the Genio-hyo-glossus, and extend- ing from the base to the apex of the organ. Posteriorly, some of the fibres are lost in the base of the tongue, and others are occasionally attached to the hyoid bone. It blends with the fibres of the Hyo-glossus, and is continued forwards as far as the apex of the tongue. It is in relation by its under surface with the ranine artery. Surgical Anatomy.—The fibrous septum which exists between the two halves of the tongue is very complete, so that the anastomosis between the two lingual arteries is not very free, a fact often illustrated by injecting one-half of the tongue with coloured size, while the other half is left uninjected, or is injected with size of a different colour. This is a point of considerable importance in connection with removal of one-half of the tongue for cancer, an operation which is now frequently resorted to when the disease is strictly confined to one side of the tongue. If the mucous membrane is divided longi- tudinally exactly in the middle line, the tongue can be split into halves along the median raphe, without any appreciable haemorrhage, and the diseased half can then be removed. Actions.—The movements of the tongue, although numerous and complicated, may be understood by carefully considering the direction of the fibres of its muscles. The Genio-hyo-glossi muscles, by means of their posterior fibres, draw the base of the tongue forwards, so as to protrude the apex from the mouth. The anterior fibres draw the tongue back into the mouth. The whole length of these two muscles acting along the middle line of the tongue draw it downwards, so as to make it concave from side to side, forming a channel along which fluids may pass towards the pharynx, as in sucking. The Hyo-glossi muscles depress the tongue, and draw down its sides, so as to render it convex from side to side. The Stylo- glossi muscles draw the tongue upwards and backwards. The Palato-glossi muscles draw the base of the tongue upwards. With regard to the intrinsic muscles, both the Superior and Inferior linguales tend to shorten the tongue, but the former, in addition, turn the tip and sides upwards so as to render the dorsum concave, while the latter pull the tip downwards and cause the dorsum to become convex. The Transverse lingualis narrows and elongates the tongue, and the Vertical lingualis flattens and broadens it. The complex arrangement of the muscular fibres of the tongue, and the various directions in which they run, give to this organ the power of assuming the various forms necessary for the enunciation of the different consonantal sounds ; and Dr. Macalister states that ' there is reason to believe that the musculature of the tongue varies in different races owing to the hereditary practice and habitual use of certain motions required for enunciating the several vernacular languages.'396 MUSCLES AND FASCIA Pharyngeal Region Inferior constrictor. Middle constrictor. Palato-pharyngeus. Salpingo-pharyngeus. Superior constrictor. Stylo-pharyngeus. (See next section.) Dissection (fig. 282).—In order to examine the muscles of the pharynx, cut through the trachea and oesophagus just above the sternum, and draw them upwards by dividing the loose areolar tissue connecting the pharynx with the front of the vertebral column. The parts being drawn well forwards, apply the edge of the saw immediately behind the styloid processes, and saw the base of the skull through from below upwards. The pharynx and mouth should then be stuffed with tow, in order to distend its cavity and render the muscles tense and easier of dissection. The Inferior constrictor, the most superficial and thickest of the three constrictors, arises from the sides of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. To the cricoid cartilage it is attached in the interval between the Crico-thyroid muscle in front, and the articular facet for the thyroid cartilage behind. To the thyroid cartilage it is attached to the oblique line on the side of the great ala, the carti- laginous surface behind it, nearly Fig. 182.—Muscles of the pharynx. External view. as far as its posterior border, and to the inferior cornu. From these attachments, the fibres spread back- wards and inwards, to be inserted into the fibrous raphe in the pos- terior median line of the pharynx. The inferior fibres are horizontal, and continuous with the fibres of the oesophagus; the rest ascend, increasing in obliquity, and overlap the Middle constrictor. The supe- rior laryngeal nerve and artery pass near the upper border, and the inferior, or recurrent laryngeal, beneath the lower border of this muscle, previous to their entering the larynx. Relations.—It is covered by a dense cellular membrane which surrounds the entire pharynx. Behind, it is in relation with the vertebral column and the Longus colli muscle; laterally, wuth the thyroid gland, the common carotid artery, and the Sterno-thyroid muscle ; by its internal surface, with the Middle constrictor, the Stylo-pharyngeus, Palato-pharyn- geus, the fibrous coat and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The Middle constrictor is a flattened, fan-shaped muscle, smaller than the preceding. It arises from the whole length of the upper surface of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid ligament. The fibres diverge from their origin : the lower ones descending beneath the Inferior constrictor, the middle fibres passing transversely, and the upper fibres397 PHARYNGEAL REGION ascending and overlapping tlie Superior constrictor. The muscle is inserted into the posterior median fibrous raphe, blending in the middle line with the one of the opposite side. Relations.—This muscle is separated from the Superior constrictor by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and the Stylo-pharyngeus muscle ; and from the Inferior constrictor by the superior laryngeal nerve. Behind, it lies on the vertebral column, the Longus colli, and the Rectus capitis anticus major. On each side it is in relation with the carotid vessels, the pharyngeal plexus, and some lymphatic glands. Near its origin, it is covered by the Hyo-glossus, from which it is separated by the lingual vessels. It lies upon the Superior constrictor, the Stylo-pharyngeus, the Palato-pharyngeus, the fibrous coat, and the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The Superior constrictor is a quadrilateral muscle, thinner and paler than the other constrictors, and situated at the upper part of the pharynx. It arises from the lower third of the posterior margin of the internal pterygoid plate and its hamular process, from the contiguous portion of the palate bone and the reflected tendon of the Tensor palati muscle, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, from the alveolar process above the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and by a few fibres from the side of the tongue. From these points the fibres curve back- wards, to be inserted into the median raphe, being also prolonged by means of a fibrous aponeurosis to the pharyngeal spine on the basilar process of the occipital bone. The superior fibres arch beneath the Levator palati and the Eustachian tube, the interval between the upper border of the muscle and the basilar process being deficient in muscular fibres, and closed by fibrous membrane. This interval is known as the sinus of Morgagni. Relations.—By its outer surface, with the vertebral column, the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves, the Middle constrictor which overlaps it, and the Stylo-pharyngeus. By its internal surface, with the Palato- pharyngeus, the tonsil, the fibrous coat and mucous membrane of the pharynx. The Stylo-pharyngeus is a long, slender muscle, round above, broad and thin below. It arises from the inner side of the base of the styloid process, passes downwards along the side of the pharynx between the Superior and Middle- constrictors, and spreads out beneath the mucous membrane, where some of its fibres are lost in the Constrictor muscles ; and others, joining with the Palato- pharyngeus, are inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. The glosso-jpharyngeal nerve runs on the outer side of this muscle, and crosses over it in passing forward to the tongue. Relations.—Externally, with the Stylo-glossus muscle, the parotid gland, the external carotid artery, and the Middle constrictor. Internally, with the internal carotid, the internal jugular vein, the Superior constrictor, Palato-pharyngeus and mucous membrane. Nerves.—The Constrictors are supplied by branches from the pharyngeal plexus, the Stylo-pharyngeus by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the Inferior constrictor by an additional branch from the external laryngeal nerve, and by the recurrent laryngeal. Actions.—When deglutition is about to be performed, the pharynx is drawn upwards and dilated in different directions, to receive the morsel propelled into it from the mouth. The Stylo-pharyngei, which are much farther removed from one another at their origin than at their insertion, draw the sides of the pharynx upwards and outwards, and so increase its transverse diameter; its breadth in the antero-posterior direction being increased by the larynx and tongue being carried forwards in their ascent. As soon as the morsel is received in the pharynx, the Elevator muscles relax, the bag descends, and the Constrictors contract upon the morsel, and convey it gradually downwards into the oesophagus. Besides its action in deglutition, the pharynx also exerts an important influence in the modulation of the voice, especially in the production of the higher tones.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 398 6.

Relations.—Externally, with the Tensor palati and Superior constrictor. Internally, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Posteriorly, with the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus, the Azygos uvuIpb, and the mucous lining of the soft palate.399 PALATAL REGION The Circumflexus or Tensor palati is a broad, thin, riband-hke muscle, placed on the outer side of the Levator palati, and consisting of a vertical and a horizontal portion. The vertical portion arises by a broad, thin, and flat lamella from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate ; from the spine of the sphenoid : the vaginal process of the temporal bone and the anterior aspect of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube : descending vertically between the internal pterygoid plate and the inner surface of the Internal pterygoid muscle, it terminates in a tendon, which winds round the hamular process, being retained in this situation by some of the fibres of origin of the Internal pterygoid muscle, and lubricated by a bursa. The tendon or horizontal portion then passes horizontally inwards, and is inserted into a broad aponeurosis, the palatine apo- neitrosis, and into the transverse ridge on the horizontal portion of the palate bone. Relations.—Externally, with the Internal pterygoid. Internally, with the Levator palati from which it is separated by the Superior constrictor, and with the internal pterygoid plate. In the soft palate, its tendon and the palatine aponeurosis is anterior to that of the Levator palati, being covered by the Palato- glossus and the mucous membrane. Palatine Aponeurosis.—Attached to the posterior border of the hard palate is a thin, firm, fibrous lamella which supports the muscles and gives strength to the soft palate. It is thicker above than below, where it becomes very thin and difficult to define. Laterally, it is continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis. The Azygos uvulae is not a single muscle, as would be inferred from its name, but a pair of narrow cylindrical fleshy fasciculi, placed side by side in the median line of the soft palate. Each muscle arises from the posterior nasal spine of the palate bone, and from the contiguous tendinous aponeurosis of the soft palate, and descends to be inserted into the uvula. Relations.—Anteriorly, with the tendinous expansion of the Levatores palati; behind, with the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus and the mucous membrane. The two next muscles are exposed by removing the mucous membrane from the pillars of the soft palate throughout nearly their whole extent. The Palato-glossus (Constrictor isthmi faucium) is a small fleshy fasciculus, narrower in the middle than at either extremity, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the anterior pillar of the soft palate. It arises from the anterior surface of the soft palate on each side of the uvula, and, passing downwards, forwards, and outwards in front of the tonsil, is inserted into the side of the tongue, some of its fibres spreading over the dorsum, and others passing deeply into the substance of the organ to intermingle with the Transversus lingua. In the soft palate, the fibres of this muscle are continuous with those of the muscle of the opposite side. The Palato-pharyngeus is a long, fleshy fasciculus, narrower in the middle than at either extremity, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the posterior pillar of the soft palate. It is separated from the Palato-glossus by an angular interval, in which the tonsil is lodged. It arises from the soft palate by an expanded fasciculus, which is divided into two parts by the Levator palati and Azygos uvulae. The posterior fasciculus lies in contact with the mucous membrane, and also joins with the corresponding muscle in the middle line ; the anterior fasciculus, the thicker, lies in the soft palate between the Levator and Tensor, and joins in the middle line the corresi^onding part of the opposite muscle. Passing- outwards and downw^ards behind the tonsil, the Palato-pharyngeus joins the Stylo- pharyngeus, and is inserted with that muscle into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, some of its fibres being lost on the side of the pharynx, and others passing across the middle line posteriorly, to decussate with the muscle of the opposite side. The Salpingo-pharyngeus.—This muscle arises from the inferior part of theMUSCLES AND FASCIA 400 Eustachian tube near its orifice ; it passes downwards and blends with the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus. Relations.—In the soft palate, its posterior surface is covered by mucous membrane, from which it is separated by a layer of palatine glands. By its anterior surface, it is in relation with the Tensor palati. Where it forms the posterior pillar of the fauces, it is covered by mucous membrane, excepting on its outer surface. In the pharynx it lies between the mucous membrane and the Constrictor muscles. In a dissection of the soft palate from its posterior or nasal surface to its anterior or oral surface, the muscles would be exposed in the following order: viz. the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus, covered over by the mucous membrane reflected from the floor of the nasal fossae ; the Azygos uvulae ; the Levator palati; the anterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus; the aponeurosis of the Tensor palati, and the Palato-glossus covered over by a reflection from the oral mucous membrane. Nerves.-—The Tensor palati is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion ; the remaining muscles of this group are in all probability supplied by the internal branch of the spinal accessory, whose fibres are distributed along with certain branches of the pneumogastric through the pharyngeal plexus.* Actions.—During the first stage of deglutition, the morsel of food is driven back into the fauces by the pressure of the tongue against the hard palate : the base of the tongue being, at the same time, retracted, and the larynx raised with the pharynx, and carried forwards under it. During the second stage, the epiglottis is pressed over the superior aperture of the larynx, and the morsel glides past it; then the Palato-glossi muscles, the constrictors of the fauces, contract behind the food; the soft palate is slightly raised by the Levator palati, and made tense by the Tensor palati; and the Palato-pharyngei, by their contraction, pull the pharynx upwards over the morsel of food, and at the same time come nearly together, the uvula filling up the slight interval between them. By these means the food is prevented passing into the upper part of the pharynx or the posterior nares ; at the same time, the latter muscles form an inclined plane, directed obliquely downwards and backwards, along the under surface of which the morsel descends into the lower part of the pharynx. The Salpingo-pharyngeus raises the upper and lateral part of the pharynx; i.e. that part which is above the point where the Stylo-|)haryngeus is attached to the pharynx. Surgical Anatomy.—The muscles of the soft palate should be carefully dissected, the relations they bear to the surrounding parts especially examined, and their action atten- tively studied upon the dead subject, as the surgeon is required to divide one or more of these muscles in the operation of staphyloraphy. Sir W. Fergusson was the first to show that in the congenital deficiency called cleft ^jo-Za/e, the edges of the fissure are forcibly separated by the action of the Le\'atores palati and Palato-pharyngei muscles, producing very considerable impediment to the healing process after the performance of the opera- tion for uniting their margins by adhesion; he, consequently, recommended the division of these muscles as one of the most important steps in the operation. This he effected by an incision made with a curved knife introduced behind the soft palate. The incision is to be half-way between the hamular process and Eustachian tube, and perpendicular to a line drawn between them. This incision perfectly accomplishes the division of the Levator palati. The Palato-pharyngeus may be divided by cutting across the posterior pillar of the soft palate, just below the tonsil, with a pair of blunt-pointed curved scissors ; and the anterior pillar may be divided also. To divide the Levator palati, the plan recommended by Mr. Pollock is to be greatly preferred. The soft palate being put upon the stretch, a double-edged knife is passed through it just on the inner side of the hamular process, and above the line of the Levator palati. The handle being now alternately raised and depressed, a sweeping cut is made along the posterior surface of the soft palate, and the knife withdrawn, leaving only a small opening in the mucous membrane on the anterior surface. If this operation is performed on the dead body, and the parts afterwards dis- sected, the Levator palati will be found completely divided. In the x)resent day, however, this division of the muscles, as part of the operation of staph^doraphy, is not so much insisted upon. All tension is prevented by making longitudinal incisions, on either side, Jcurnal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxiii. p. 523.ANTERIOK VERTEBRAL REGION 401 parallel to the cleft and just internal to the hamiilar process, in such a position as to avoid the posterior palatine artery. 7. Anterior Vertebral Region Rectus capitis anticus major. Rectus capitis lateralis. Rectus capitis anticus minor. Longus colli. The Rectus capitis anticus major (fig. 284), broad and thick above, narrow below, appears like a continuation upwards of the Scalenus anticus. It arises by Fig. 284.—The prevertebral muscles. four tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and ascends, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side, to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the pharynx, the sympathetic nerve, and the sheath enclosing the internal and common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve. By its ]josterior surface, with the Longus colli, the Rectus capitis anticus minor, and the upper cervical vertebrae. The Rectus capitis anticus minor is a short, flat muscle, situated immediately behind the upper part of the preceding. It arises from the anterior surface of the lateral mass of the atlas, and from the root of its transverse process, and passing obliquely upwards and inwards, is inserted into the basilar process immediately behind the preceding muscle. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Rectus capitis anticus major. By posterior surface, with the front of the occipito-atlantal articulation. D D402 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Rectus capitis lateralis is a short, flat muscle, which arises from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the internal jugular vein. By its posterior surface, with the vertebral artery. On its outer side lies the occipital artery ; on its inner side the suboccipital nerve. The Longus Colli is a long, flat muscle, situated on the anterior surface of the spine, between the atlas and the third dorsal vertebra. It is broad in the middle, narrow and pointed at each extremity, and consists of three portions : a superior oblique, an inferior oblique, and a vertical portion. The sujjerior ohliqiie portion arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae ; and, ascending obliquely inwards, is inserted by a narrow tendon into the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. The inferior oblique 2^ortion, the smallest part of the muscle, arises from the front of the bodies of the first two or three dorsal vertebrae ; and ascending obliquely outwards, is inserted into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. The vertical portion directly on the front of the spine ; it arises, below, from the front of the bodies of the upper three dorsal and lower three cervical vertebrae, and is inserted above into the front of the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae above. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the pharynx, the oesophagus, sympa- thetic nerve, the sheath of the great vessels of the neck, the inferior thyroid artery, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. By its ijosterior surface, with the cervical and dorsal portions of the spine. Its inner border is separated from the opposite muscle by a considerable interval below ; but they approach each other above. 8. Lateral Yeetebeal Eegion Scalenus anticus. Scalenus medius. Scalenus posticus. The Scalenus anticus is a conical-shaped muscle, situated deeply at the side of the neck, behind the Sterno-mastoid. It arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and descending, almost vertically, is inserted by a narrow, fiat tendon into the impression on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib. The lower part of this muscle separates the subclavian artery and vein : the latter being in front, and the former, with the brachial plexus, behind. Relations.—In front, with the clavicle, the Subclavius, Sterno-mastoid, and Omo-hyoid muscles, the transversalis colli, the suprascapular and ascending cervical arteries, the subclavian vein, and the phrenic nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Scalenus medius, pleura, the subclavian artery, and brachial plexus of nerves. It is separated from the Longus colli, on the inner side, by the vertebral artery. On the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, between the attachments of the Scalenus anticus and Longus colli, lies the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery. The Scalenus medius, the largest and longest of the three Scaleni, arises from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebrae, and descending along the side of the vertebral column is inserted by a broad attachment into the upper surface of the first rib, behind the groove for the subclavian artery, as far back as the tubercle. It is separated from the Scalenus anticus by the subclavian artery below, and the cervical nerves above. The posterior thoracic, or nerve of Bell, is formed in the substance of the Scalenus medius and emerges from it. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Sterno-mastoid ; it is crossed by the clavicle, the Omo-hyoid muscle, subclavian artery, and the cervical nerves. To its outer side is the Levator anguli scapulte, and the Scalenus posticus muscle.LATERAL VERTEBRAL REGION The Scalenus posticus, the smallest of the three Scaleni, arises, by two or three separate tendons, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower two or three cervical vertebrae, and, diminishing as it descends, is inserted by a thin tendon into the outer surface of the second rib, behind the attachment of the Serratus magnus. This is the most deeply placed of the three Scaleni, and is occasionally blended with the Scalenus medius. Nerves.—The Rectus capitis anticus major and minor and the Rectus lateralis are supplied by the first cervical nerve, and from the loop formed between it and Fig. 285.—Muscles of the neck. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England.) STYLO-GLOSSUS - -STERNO-HYOIO the second; the Longus colli and Scaleni, by branches from the anterior divisions of the lower cervical nerves (fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth) before they form the brachial plexus. The Scalenus medius also receives a filament from the deep external branches of the cervical plexus. Actions.—The Rectus anticus major and minor are the direct antagonists of the muscles at the back of the neck, serving to restore the head to its natural position after it has been drawn backwards. These muscles also serve to flex the head, and, from their obliquity, rotate it, so as to turn the face to one or the other side. The Longus colli flexes and slightly rotates the cervical portion of the spine. The D D 2404 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE Scaleni muscles, when they take then- fixed point from above, elevate the first and second ribs, and are, therefore, inspiratory muscles. When they take their fixed point from below, they bend the spinal column to one or the other side. If the muscles of both sides act, lateral movement is prevented, but the spine is slightly flexed. The Rectus lateralis, acting on one side, bends the head laterally. Surface Form.—The muscles in the neck, with the exception of the Platysma myoides, are invested by the deep cervical fascia, which softens down their form, and is of con- siderable importance in connection with deep cervical abscesses and tumours, modifying the direction of their growth and causing them to extend laterally instead of towards the surface. The Platysma myoides does not influence surface form except it is in action, when it produces wrinkling of the skin of the neck, which is thrown into oblique ridges parallel with the fasciculi of the muscle. Sometimes this contraction takes place suddenly and repeatedly, as a sort of spasmodic twitching, the result of a nervous habit. The Sterno-cleido-mastoid is the most important muscle of the neck as regards its surface form. If the muscle is put into action by drawing the chin downwards and to the opposite shoulder, its surface form will be plainly outlined. The sternal origin wiU stand out as a sharply defined ridge, while the clavicular origin will present a flatter and not so prominent an outline. The fleshy middle portion will appear as an oblique roll or eleva- tion, with a thick rounded anterior border gradually becoming less marked above. On the opposite side, i.e. on the side to which the head is turned, the outline is lost, its place being occupied by an oblique groove in the integument. When the muscle is at rest its anterior border is still visible, forming an oblique rounded ridge, terminating below in the sharp outline of the sternal head. The posterior border of the muscle does not show above the clavicular head. The anterior border is defined by drawing a line from the tip of the mastoid process to the sterno-clavicular joint. It is an important surface-marking in the operation of ligature of the common carotid artery and some other operations. Between the sternal and clavicular heads is a slight depression, most marked when the muscle is in action. This is bounded below by the prominent sternal extremity of the clavicle. Between the sternal origins of the two muscles is a V-shaped space, the suprasternal notch, more pronounced below, and becoming toned down above, where the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, lying upon the trachea, become more prominent. Above the liyoid bone, in the middle line, the anterior belly of the Digastric to a certain extent influences surface form. It corresponds to a line drawn from the symphysis of the lower jaw to the side of the body of the hyoid bone, and renders this part of the hyo-mental region convex. In the posterior triangle of the neck, the posterior belly of the Omo- hyoid, when in action, forms a conspicuous object, especially in thin necks, presenting a cord-like form running across this region, almost parallel with, and a little above, the clavicle. MUSCLES AND FASCI/E OF THE TRUNK The muscles of the Trunk may be arranged in four groups : the muscles of the Back, of the Thorax, of the Abdomen, and of the Perinseum. Muscles of the Back The muscles of the back are very numerous, and may be subdivided into five layers. First Layer Trapezius. Latissimus dorsi. Second Layer Levator anguli scapula. Rhomboideus minor. Rhomboideus major. Third Layer Serratus posticus superior. Serratus posticus inferior. Splenius capitis. Splenius colli. Fourth Layer Sacral and Lumbar Begions Erector spinas.

Fig. 2i -Dissection of the muscles of the back. Dissection (fig. 286).—Place the body in the prone position, with the arms extended over the sides of the table, and the chest and abdomen supported by several blocks, so as to render the muscles tense. Then make an incision along the middle line of the back, from the occipital protuberance to the coccyx. Make a transverse incision from the upper end of this to the mastoid process ; and a third incision from its lower end, along the crest of the ilium to about its middle. This large intervening space should, for convenience of dissection, be sub- divided by a fourth incision, extending obliquely from the spinous process of the last dorsal ver- tebra, upwards and outwards, to the acromion process. This incision corresponds with the lower border of the Trapezius muscle. The flaps of integument are then to be removed in the direc- tion shown in the figure. The superficial fascia is exposed upon removing the skin from the back. It forms a layer of considerable thickness and strength, in which a quantity of granular pinkish fat is contained. It is continuous with the superficial fascia in other parts of the body. The deep fascia is a dense fibrous layer, attached to the occipital bone, the spines of the vertebra, the crest of the ilium, and the spine of the scapula. It covers over the superficial muscles, forming sheaths for them, and is continuous, in the neck at the anterior border of the Trapezius, with the deep cervical fascia ; in the thorax, with the deep fascia of the axilla and chest, and in the abdomen with that covering the abdominal muscles. The Trapezius (fig. 287) is a broad, fiat, triangular muscle, placed immediately beneath the skin and fascia, and covering the upper and back part of the neck and shoulders. It arises from the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone; from the ligamentum nuchae, the spinous process of the seventh cervical, and those of all the dorsal vertebrae ; and from the corresponding portion of the supraspinous ligament. From this origin, the superior fibres proceed downwards and outwards, the inferior ones upwards and outwards ; and the middle fibres, horizontally; and are inserted, the superior ones into the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle ; the middle fibres into the inner margin of the acromion process, and into the superior lip of the posterior border or crest of the spine of the scapula ; the inferior fibres converge near the scapula, and terminate in a triangular aponeurosis, which glides over a smooth surface at the inner extremityOF THE BACK of the spine, to be inserted into a tubercle at the outer part of this smooth surface. The Trapezius, is fleshy in the greater part of its extent, but tendinous at its origin and insertion. At its occipital origin, it is connected to the bone by a thin fibrous lamina, firmly adherent to the skin, and wanting the lustrous, shining appearance of aponeuroses. At its origin from the spines of the vertebrjB, it is connected to the bones by means of a broad semi-elliptical aponeurosis, which occupies the space between the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebrae, and forms, with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle, a tendinous ellipse. The rest of the muscle arises by numerous short tendinous fibres. If the Trapezius is dissected on both sides, the two muscles resemble a trapezium, or diamond-shaped quadrangle; two angles corresponding to the shoulders; a third to the occipital protuberance; and the fourth to the spinous process of the last dorsal vertebra. The clavicular insertion of this muscle varies as to the extent of its attach- ment : it sometimes advances as far as the middle of the clavicle, and may even become blended with the posterior edge of the Sterno-mastoid, or overlap it. This should be borne in mind in the operation for tying the third part of the subclavian artery. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument. By its deep surface, in the neck, with the Complexus, SiDlenius, Levator anguli scapulae, and Ehomboideus minor ; in the back, with the Ehomboideus major, Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, the Vertebral aponeurosis (which separates it from the prolongations of the Erector spinas), and the Latissimus dorsi. The spinal accessory nerve and the superficial cervical artery pass beneath the anterior border of this muscle, near the clavicle. The anterior margin of its cervical portion forms the posterior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck, the other boundaries being the Sterno- mastoid in front, and the clavicle below. The Ligamentum nuchge (fig. 287) is a thin band of condensed cellulo-fibrous membrane, placed in the line of union between the two Trapezii in the neck. It extends from the external occipital protuberance to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the supraspinous ligament. From its anterior surface a fibrous lamina is given off, which is attached to the spinous process of each of the cervical vertebrae, excepting the atlas, so as to form a septum between the muscles on each side of the neck. In man it is merely the rudiment of an important elastic ligament, which, in some of the lower animals, serves to sustain the weight of the head. The Latissimus dorsi is a broad flat muscle, which covers the lumbar and the lower half of the dorsal regions, and is gradually contracted into a narrow fasciculus at its insertion into the humerus. It arises by an aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the six inferior dorsal, from those of the lumbar and sacral vertebra, and from the supraspinous ligament. Over the sacrum, the aponeurosis of this muscle blends with the posterior layer of the lumbar fascia. It also arises from the external lip of the crest of the ilium, behind the origin of the External oblique, and by fleshy digitations from the three or four lower ribs, which are interposed between similar processes of the External oblique muscle (fig. 292, page 426). From this extensive origin the fibres pass in different directions, the upper ones horizontally, the middle obliquely upwards, and the lower vertically upwards, so as to converge and form a thick fasciculus, which crosses the inferior angle of the scapula, and occasionally receives a few fibres from it. The muscle then curves around the lower border of the Teres major, and is twisted upon itseh\ so that the superior fibres become at first posterior and then inferior, and the vertical fibres at first anterior and then superior. It then terminates in a short quadrilateral tendon, about three inches in length, which, passing in front of the tendon of the Teres major, is inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus; its insertion extending higher on the humerus than that of the tendon of the Pectoralis major. The lower border of the tendon of this muscle is united with that of the Teres major, the surfaces of the two being separated by a bursa ; another bursa is sometimes interposed between the muscle and the inferiorMUSCLES AND FASCIAE 4o8 angle of the scapula. This muscle at its insertion gives off an expansion to the deep fascia of the arm. X muscular slip, varyiug from 3 to 4 inches in length, and from ^ to | of an inch in breadth, occasionally arises from the upper edge of the Latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the Pectoralis major, the Coraco-brachialis, or the fascia over the Biceps. The position of this abnormal slip is a point of interest in its relation to the axillary artery, as it crosses the vessel just above the spot usually selected for the application of a ligature, and may mislead the surgeon during the operation. It may be easily recognised by the transverse direction of its fibres. Dr. Struther found it, in 8 out of 105 subjects, occurring seven times on both sides. Eelations.—Its suijerficial surface is subcutaneous, excepting at its upper part, where it is covered by the Trapezius, and at its insertion, where its tendon is crossed by the axillary vessels and the brachial plexus of nerves. By its deep surface, it is in relation with the Lumbar fascia, the Serratus posticus inferior, the lower external intercostal muscles and ribs, inferior angle of the scapula, Ehom- boideus major, Infraspinatus, and Teres major. Its outer margin is separated below from the External oblique by a small triangular interval; and another triangular interval exists between its upper border and the margin of the Trapezius, in which the Ehomboideus major muscle is exposed. Nerves.—^The Trapezius is supplied by the spinal accessory, and by branches from the anterior divisions of the third and fourth cervical nerves ; the Latissimus dorsi by the middle or long subscapular nerve. Second Layee Levator anguli scapulae. Ehomboideus minor. Ehomboideus major. Dissection.—The Trapezius must be removed, in order to expose the next layer ; to effect this, detach the muscle from its attachment to the clavicle and spine of the scapula, and turn it back towards the spine. The Levator anguli scapulae is situated at the back part and side of the neck. It arises by tendinous slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four upper cervical vertebrae ; these, becoming fleshy, are united so as to form a flat muscle, which, passing downwards and backwards, is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula, between the superior angle and the triangular smooth surface at the root of the spine. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument, Trapezius, and Sterno-mastoid. By its deep surface, with the Splenius colli, Transversalis colli, Cervicalis ascendens, and Serratus posticus superior muscles, and with the trans- versalis colli and posterior scapular arteries. The Ehomboideus minor arises from the ligamentum nuchae and spinous processes of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebra. Passing downwards and outwards, it is inserted into the margin of the triangular smooth surface at the root of the spine of the scapula. This small muscle is usually separated from the Ehomboideus major by a slight cellular interval. Relations.—By its superficial (posterior) surface, with the Trapezius. By its dee2) surface, with the same structures as the Ehomboideus major. The Rhomboideus major is situated immediately below the preceding, the adjacent margins of the two being occasionally united. It arises by tendinous fibres from the spinous processes of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrae and the supraspinous ligament, and is inserted into a narrow tendinous arch, attached above to the lower part of the triangular surface at the root of the spine ; below, to the inferior angle, the arch being connected to the border of the scapula by a thin membrane. When the arch extends, as it occasionally does, but a short distance, the muscular fibres are inserted into the scapula itself.OF THE BACK 409 Relations.—By its suijerficiaTJ^vosterioi') surface, with the Latissimus dorsi. By its dee]j {anterior) surface, with the Serratus posticus superior, posterior scapular artery, the vertebral aponeurosis which separates it from the prolongations from the Erector spin^, the Intercostal muscles, and ribs. Nerves.—^The Ehomboid muscles are supplied by branches from the anterior division of the fifth cervical nerve; the Levator anguli scapulae by the anterior division of the third and fourth cervical nerves. Actions.—The movements effected by the preceding piuscles are numerous, as may be conceived from their extensive attachment. The whole of the Trapezius when in action retracts the scapula and rotates it on a sagittal axis; if the head is fixed, the upper part of the Trapezius will elevate the point of the shoulder, as in supporting weights ; when the louver fibres are brought into action they assist in depressing the bone. If the scapula is prevented from gliding on the chest, the middle and lower fibres of the muscle cause it to rotate, so that the acromion is raised. If the shoulders are fixed, both Trapezii, acting together, will draw the head directly backwards ; or if only one acts, the head is drawn to the corresponding side. The Latissimus dorsi, when it acts upon the humerus, draws it backwards, adducts, and at the same time rotates it inwards. It is the muscle which is principally employed in giving a downward blow, as in felling a tree or in sabre practice. If the arm is fixed, the muscle may act in various ways upon the trunk : thus, it may raise the lower ribs and assist in forcible inspiration; or, if both arms are fixed, the two muscles may assist the Abdominal and great Pectoral muscles in suspending and drawing the whole trunk forwards, as in climbing or walking on crutches. The Levator angtili scapulcB raises the superior angle of the scapula, assisting the Trapezius in bearing weights or in shrugging the shoulders. If the shoulder be fixed, the Levator anguli scapulaB inclines the neck to the corresponding side and rotates it in the same direction. The Ehomboid muscles carry the inferior angle backwards and upwards, thus producing a slight rotation of the scapula upon the side of the chest, the Ehomboideus major acting especially on the lower angle of the scapula, through the tendinous arch by which it is inserted. The Ehomboid muscles acting together with the middle and inferior fibres of the Trapezius will draw the scapiila directly backwards towards the spine. Dissection.—To bring into view the third layer of muscles, remove the whole of the second, together with the Latissimus dorsi; by cutting through the Levator anguli scapulae and Ehomboid muscles near their insertion, and reflecting them upwards, and by dividing the Latissimus dorsi in the middle by a vertical incision carried from its upper to its lower part, and reflecting the two halves of the muscle. The Serratus posticus superior is a thin, flat, quadrilateral muscle, situated at the upper and back part of the thorax. It arises by a thin and broad aponeurosis from the ligamentum nuchse, and from the spinous processes of the last cervical and two or three upper dorsal vertebrae and from the supraspinous ligament. Inclining downwards and outwards, it becomes muscular, and is inserted, by four fleshy digitations, into the upper borders of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, a little beyond their angles. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Trapezius, Ehomboidei, and Levator anguli scapulas. By its deeiJ surface, with the Splenius, and the vertebral aponeurosis, which separates it from the prolongations of the Erector spinae, and with the Intercostal muscles and ribs. Third Layer Serratus posticus superior. Serratus posticus inferior.MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Serratus posticus inferior is situated at the junction of the dorsal and lumbar regions: it is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, broader than the preceding, and separated from it by a considerable interval. It arises by a thin aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and two or three upper lumbar vertebrae, and from the supraspinous ligaments. Passing obliquely upwards and outwards, it becomes fleshy, and divides into four flat digitations, which are inserted into the lower borders of the four lower ribs, a little beyond their angles. The thin aponeurosis of origin is intimately blended with the tendon of origin of the Latissimus dorsi muscle and with the lumbar fascia. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Latissimus dorsi, with the aponeurosis of w^hich its own aponeurotic origin is inseparably blended. By its deep surface, with the lumbar fascia, the Erector spinse, ribs, and Intercostal muscles. Its upper margin is continuous with the vertebral aponeurosis. The Vertebral aponeurosis is a thin, fibrous lamina, extending along the whole length of the back part of the thoracic region, serving to bind down the long extensor muscles of the back which support the spine and head, and separate them from those muscles which connect the spine to the upper extremity. It con- sists of longitudinal and transverse fibres blended together, forming a thin lamella, which is attached in the median line to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae ; externally, to the angles of the ribs ; and below, to the upper border of the Serratus posticus inferior and tendon of origin of the Latissimus dorsi; above, it passes beneath the Serratus posticus superior and the Splenius, and blends with the deep fascia of the neck. The Lumbar fascia {fig. 288) is a thick and strong lamella occupying the interval between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. It is attached internally to the spinous processes of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae ; above, to the last rib, and to the cartilage of the eleventh rib ; below, to the posterior third of the crest of the ilium. Externally, it blends with the Transversalis abdominis muscle. The posterior or superficial surface of this fascia gives attachment to part of the origin of the Latissimus dorsi, to the Serratus posticus inferior, and to the Internal oblique muscle of the abdomen. The anterior or deep surface gives off two layers : one lies between the Erector spinae and Quadratus lumborum, and is attached to the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae ; the other lies on the anterior or internal surface of the Quadratus lumborum, and is attached to the front part of the same transverse processes. The upper portion of this layer, which extends from the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the apex and lower border of the last rib, constitutes the ligamentum arcuatum externum. Therefore these three layers of the lumbar fascia form two spaces : between the posterior and middle layer is situated the Erector spinae and the Multifidus spinas; between the middle and anterior layers is situated the Quadratus lumborum. Now detach the Serratus posticus suj)erior from its origin, and turn it outwards, when the Splenius muscle will be brought into view. The Splenius is situated at the back of the neck and upper part of the dorsal region. At its origin, it is a single muscle, narrow, and pointed in form; but it soon becomes broader, and divides into two portions, which have separate inser- tions. It arises, by tendinous fibres, from the lower half of the ligamentum nuch^e, from the spinous processes of the last cervical and of the six upper dorsal vertebrae, and from the supraspinous ligament. From this origin, the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely upwards and outwards, forming a broad flat muscle, which divides as it ascends into two portions, the Splenius capitis and Splenius colli. The Splenius capitis is inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and into the rough surface on the occipital bone just beneath the superior curved line. The Splenius colli is inserted, by tendinous fasciculi, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the two or three upper cervical vertebras.411 OF THE BACK Fig. 288.—Muscles of the back. Deep layers.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 412 The Splenins is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a triangular interval, in which is seen the Complexus. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Trapezius, from which it is separated below by the Ehomboidei and the Serratus posticus superior. It is covered at its insertion by the Sterno-mastoid, and at the low^er and back part of the neck by the Levator anguli scapulse. By its deep surface, with the Spinalis dorsi, Longissimus dorsi, Semispinalis colli, Complexus, Trachelo-mastoid, and Transversalis colli. Nerves.—The Splenius is supplied from the external branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves ; the Serratus posticus superior is supplied by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the upper dorsal nerves ; the Serratus posticus inferior by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the lower dorsal nerves. Actions.—The Serrati are respiratory muscles. The Serratus posticus supe- rior elevates the ribs; it is therefore an inspiratory muscle; while the Serratus inferior draws the lower ribs downwards and backwards, and thus elongates the thorax. It also fixes the lower ribs, thus aiding the downward action of the diaphragm and resisting the tendency which it has to draw the lower ribs upwards and forwards. It must therefore be regarded as a muscle of inspiration. This muscle is also probably a tensor of the vertebral aponeurosis. The Splenii muscles of the two sides, acting together, draw the head directly backwards, assisting the Trapezius and Complexus ; acting separately, they draw the head to one or the other side, and slightly rotate it, turning the face to the same side. They also assist in supporting the head in the erect position. Fourth Layee Sacral and Lumbar Begions Cervical Begion Erector spina?. Cervicalis ascendens. Dorsal Begion Transversalis colli.

Dissection.—To expose the muscles of the fourth layer, remove entirely the Serrati and the vertebral and lumbar fasciae. Then detach the Splenius by separating its attachment to the spmons processes and reflecting it outwards. The Erector spinsB (fig. 288), and its prolongations in the dorsal and cervical regions, fill up the vertebral groove on each side of the spine. It is covered in the lumbar region by the lumbar fascia; in the dorsal region by the Serrati muscles and the vertebral aponeurosis; and in the cervical region by a layer of cervical fascia continued beneath the Trapezius and the Splenius. This large muscular and tendinous mass varies in size and structure at different parts of the spine. In the sacral region, the Erector spinse is narrow and pointed, and its origin chiefly tendinous in structure. In the lumbar region, the muscle becomes enlarged, and forms a large fleshy mass. In the dorsal region, it subdivides into two parts, which gradually diminish in size as they ascend to be inserted into the vertebrae and ribs. In the cervical region, it is gradually lost, where a number of small muscles are continued upwards to the head to support it upon the spine. The Erector spins arises from the sacro-iliac groove, and from the anterior surface of a very broad and thick tendon, which is attached, internally, to the spines of the sacrum, to the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligament; externally, to the back part of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, and to the series of eminences on the posterior part of the sacrum, which represent the transverse processes, where it blends with the great sacro- sciatic ligament. The muscular fibres form a single large fleshy mass, bounded inOF THE BACK 413 front by the transverse processes of the kimbar vertebrae, and by the middle lamella of the lumbar fascia. Opposite the last rib it divides into two parts, the Ilio-costalis and the Longissimus dorsi. The Ilio-costalis {Sacro-lumhalis), the external and smaller portion of the Erector spinas, is inserted, generally, by six or seven flattened tendons, into the angles of the six or seven lower ribs. The number of the tendons of this muscle is, however, very variable, and therefore the number of ribs into which it is inserted. Frequently it is found to possess nine or ten tendons, and sometimes as many tendons as there are ribs, and is then inserted into the angles of all the ribs. If this muscle is reflected outwards, it will be seen to be reinforced by a series of muscular slips, which arise from the angles of the ribs ; by means of these the Ilio- costalis is continued upwards to the upper ribs, and the cervical portion of the spine. The accessory portions form tAvo additional muscles, the Musculus accessorius and the Cervicalis ascendens. The Musculus accessorius ad ilio-costalem arises, by separate flattened tendons, from the angles of the six lower ribs ; these become muscular, and are finally inserted, by separate tendons, into the angles of the six upper ribs. The Cervicalis ascendens* is the continuation of the Accessorius upwards into the neck; it is situated on the inner side of the tendons of the Accessorius, arising from the angles of the four or five upper ribs, and is inserted by a series of slender tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebras. The Longissimus dorsi is the inner and larger portion of the Erector spinas. In the lumbar region, where it is as yet blended with the Ilio-costalis, some of the fibres are attached to the whole length of the posterior surface of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebras, to the tubercles at the back of the articular processes, and to the middle layer of the lumbar fascia. In the dorsal region, the Longissimus dorsi is inserted, by long thin tendons, into the tips of the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae, and into from seven to eleven of the lower ribs between their tubercles and angles. This muscle is continued upwards, to the cranium and cervical portion of the spine, by means of two additional muscles, the Transversalis colli and Trachelo-mastoid. The Transversalis colli (or cervicis), placed on the inner side of the Longis- simus dorsi, arises by long thin tendons from the summits of the transverse processes of the six upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted by similar tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae from the second to the sixth. The Trachelo-mastoid lies on the inner side of the preceding, between it and the Complexus muscle. It arises, by four tendons, from the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal vertebrae, and by additional separate tendons from the articular processes of the three or four lower cervical. The fibres form a small muscle, which ascends to be inserted into the posterior margin of the mastoid process, beneath the Splenius and Sterno-mastoid muscles. This small muscle is almost always crossed by a tendinous intersection near its insertion into the mastoid process, j Relations.—The Erector spinae and its prolongations are bound down to the vertebrae and ribs in the lumbar and dorsal regions by the lumbar fascia and the vertebral aponeurosis. The inner part of these muscles covers the muscles of the fifth layer. In the neck, they are in relation, by their superficial surface, with the Trapezius and Splenius ; by their deep surface, with the Semispinalis dorsi et colli, and the Recti and Obliqui. * This muscle is sometimes called ' Cervicalis descendens.' The student should remember that these long muscles take their fixed point from above or from below, according to circumstances. t These two muscles are sometimes described as one, having a common origin, but dividing above at their insertion. The Trachelo-mastoid is then termed the Transversalis capitis.414 MUSCLES AND FASCIA The Spinalis dorsi connects the spinous processes of the upper kimbar and the dorsal vertebrae together by a series of muscular and tendinous slips, which are intimately blended with the Longissimus dorsi. It is situated at the inner side of the Longissimus dorsi, arising, by three or four tendons, from the spinous processes of the first two lumbar and the last two dorsal vertebrse : these, uniting, form a small muscle, which is inserted, by separate tendons, into the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae, the number varying from four to eight. It is intimately united with the Semispinalis dorsi, which lies beneath it. The Spinalis colli is a small muscle, connecting together the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae, and analogous to the Spinalis dorsi in the dorsal region. It varies considerably in its size, and in its extent of attachment to the vertebrae, not only in different bodies, but on the two sides of the same body. It usually arises by fleshy or tendinous slips, varying from tAVO to four in number, from the spinous processes of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical vertebrae, and occasionally from the first and second dorsal, and is inserted into the spinous process of the axis, and occasionally into the spinous processes of the two vertebrae below it. This muscle was found absent in five cases out of twenty-four. The Complexus is a broad thick muscle, situated at the upper and back part of the neck, beneath the Splenius, and internal to the Transversalis colli and Trachelo- mastoid. It arises, by a series of tendons, about seven in number, from the tips of the transverse processes of the upper three dorsal and seventh cervical vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the three* cervical above this. The tendons, uniting, form a broad muscle, which passes obliquely upwards and inwards, and is inserted into the innermost depression between the two curved lines of the occipital bone. This muscle, about its middle, is traversed by a transverse tendinous intersection. The Biventer cervicis is a small fasciculus, situated on the inner side of the preceding, and in the majority of cases blended with it; it has received its name from having a tendon intervening between two fleshy bellies. It is sometimes described as a separate muscle, arising, by from two to four tendinous slips, from the transverse processes of as many of the upper dorsal vertebrae, and inserted, on the inner side of the Complexus, into the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Relations.—The Complexus is covered by the Splenius and the Trapezius. It lies on the Kectus capitis posticus major and minor, the ObHquus capitis superior and inferior, and on the Semispinalis colli, from which it is separated by the profunda cervicis artery, the princeps cervicis artery, and branches of the posterior cervical plexus of nerves. The Biventer cervicis is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the ligamentum nuchae. Nerves.—The Erector spin^ and its subdivisions in the dorsal region are supplied by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar and dorsal nerves ; while its subdivisions in the cervical region, the Transversalis colli and Trachelo-mastoid, are supplied by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves ; the Complexus, by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves, the suboccipital and great occipital. The Spinahs colli is supphed by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves ; and the Spinalis dorsi, by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves.

The muscles filling up the interval between the spinous and transverse processes are then exposed. The Semispinalis dorsi (fig. 288) consists of thin, narrow, fleshy fasciculi, inter-* posed between tendons of considerable length. It arises by a series of small tendons from the transverse processes of the lower dorsal vertebrae, from the tenth or eleventh to the fifth or sixth ; and is inserted, by five or six tendons, into the spinous processes of the upper four dorsal and lower two cervical vertebrae. The Semispinalis colli, thicker than the preceding, arises by a series of tendinous and fleshy fibres from the transverse processes of the upper four dorsal vertebrae and from the articular processes of the lower four cervical vertebrae; and is inserted into the spinous processes of four cervical vertebrae, from the axis to the fifth cervical. The fasciculus connected with the axis is the largest, and chiefly muscular in structure. Relations.—By their superficial surface, from below upwards, with the Spinalis dorsi, Longissimus dorsi, Splenius, Complexus, the profunda cervicis artery, the princeps cervicis artery, and the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the first, second, and third cervical nerves. By their deep stirface, with the Multifidus spinae. The Multifidus spinse consists of a number of fleshy and tendinous fasciculi, which fill up the groove on either side of the spinous processes of the vertebrae, from the sacrum to the axis. In the sacral region, these fasciculi arise from the back of the sacrum, as low as the fourth sacral foramen, and from the aponeurosis of origin of the Erector spinas ; in the iliac region, from the inner surface of the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and posterior sacro-iliac ligaments ; in the lumbar regions, from the articular processes; in the dorsal region, from the transverse processes ; and in the cervical region, from the articular processes. Each fasciculus, passing obliquely upwards and. inwards, is inserted into the lamina and whole length of the spinous process of one of the vertebrae above. These fasciculi vary in length : the most superficial, the longest, pass from one vertebra to the third or fourth above ; those next in order pass from one vertebra to the second or third above; whilst the deepest connect two contiguous vertebrae. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Longissimus dorsi, Spinalis dorsi, Semispinalis dorsi, and Semispinalis colli. By its deep surface, with the laminae and spinous processes of the vertebrae, and with the Eotatores spinae in the dorsal region. The Rotatores spinae are found only in the dorsal region of the spine, beneath the Multifidus spinae ; they are eleven in number on each side. Each muscle is small and somewhat quadrilateral in form ; it arises from the upper and back part of the transverse process, and is inserted into the lower border and outer surface of the lamina of the vertebra above, the fibres extending as far inwards as the root of the spinous process. The first is found between the first and second dorsal; the last, between the eleventh and twelfth. Sometimes the number of these muscles is diminished by the absence of one or more from the upper or lower end. The Supraspinales consist of a series of fleshy bands which lie on the spinous processes in the cervical region of the spine. The Interspinales are short muscular fasciculi, placed in pairs betw^een the spinous processes of the contiguous vertebrse, one on each side of the interspinous ligament. In the cervical region, they are most distinct, and consist of six pairs, the first being situated between the axis and third vertebra, and the last between the last cervical and the first dorsal. They are small narrow bundles, attached, above and below, to the apices of the spinous processes. In the dorsal region, they are found between the first and second vertebra, and occasionally between4i6 MUSCLES AND FASCIA the second and third ; and below, between the eleventh and twelfth. In the lumbar region, there are four paks of these muscles in the intervals between the five lumbar vertebrae. There is also occasionally one in the interspinous space, between the last dorsal and first lumbar, and between the fifth lumbar and the sacrum. The Extensor coccygis is a slender muscular fasciculus, occasionally present, which extends over the lower part of the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx. It arises by tendinous fibres from the last bone of the sacrum, or first piece of the coccyx, and passes downwards to be inserted into the lower part of the coccyx. It is a rudiment of the Extensor muscle of the caudal vertebrae which exists in some animals. The Intertransversales are small muscles placed between the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae. In the cervical region they are most developed, consisting of rounded muscular and tendinous fasciculi, which are placed in pairs, passing between the tw^o anterior and the two posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of two contiguous vertebrae, separated from one another by the anterior division of the cervical nerve, which lies in the groove between them. In this region there are seven pairs of these muscles, the first pair being between the atlas and axis, and the last pair between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. In the dorsal region they are least developed, consisting chiefly of rounded tendinous cords in the intertransverse spaces of the upper dorsal vertebrae ; but between the transverse processes of the lower three dorsal vertebrae, and between the transverse processes of the last dorsal and the first lumbar, they are muscular in structure. In the lumbar region they are four in number, and consist of a single muscular layer, which occupies the entire interspace between the transverse processes of the lower lumbar vertebra ; whilst those between the transverse processes of the upper lumbar are not attached to more than half the breadth of the process. The Rectus capitis posticus major arises by a pointed tendinous origin from the spinous process of the axis, and, becoming broader as it ascends, is inserted into the inferior curved line of the occipital bone and the surface of bone imme- diately below it. As the muscles of the two sides pass upwards and outwards, they leave between them a triangular space, in which are seen the Recti capitis postici minores muscles. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Complexus ; and, at its insertion, with the Superior oblique. By its deep surface, Avith part of the Eectus capitis posticus minor, the posterior arch of the atlas, the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and part of the occipital bone. The Eectus capitis posticus minor, the smallest of the four muscles in this region, is of a triangular shape; it arises by a narrow pointed tendon from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the atlas, and, becoming broader as it ascends, is inserted into the rough surface beneath the inferior curved line, nearly as far as the foramen magnum, nearer to the middle line than the preceding. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Complexus and the Rectus capitis posticus major. By its deep sttrface, with the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament. The Obliquus capitis inferior, the larger of the two Oblique muscles, arises from the apex of the spinous process of the axis, and passes almost horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the lower and back part of the transverse process of the atlas. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Complexus and with the posterior division of the second cervical nerve which crosses it. By its deep surface, with the vertebral artery, and posterior atlanto-axial ligament. The Obliquus capitis superior, narrow below, wide and expanded above, arises by tendinous fibres from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, joining with the insertion of the preceding, and, passing obliquely upwards and inwards, is inserted into the occipital bone, between the two curved lines, external to the Complexus.417 OF THE BACK Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Complexus and Trachelo- mastoid. By its deep surface, with the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament. The Suboccipital Triangle.—Between the two obhque muscles and the Eectus capitis posticus major a triangular interval exists, the suboccipital triangle. This triangle is bounded, above and internally, by the Eectus capitis posticus major ; above and externally, by the Obliquus capitis superior ; below and externally, by the Obliquus capitis inferior. It is covered in by a layer of dense fibro-fatty tissue, situated beneath the Complexus muscle. The floor is formed by the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, the posterior arch of the atlas, and the posterior atlanto- axial ligament. It contains the vertebral artery, as it runs in a deep groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of the atlas ; and the posterior division of the suboccipital nerve. Nerves.—The Semispinalis dorsi and Eotatores spin^e are supplied by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves ; the Semispinalis colli, by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves ; the Supraspinales and Interspinals are supplied by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar nerves in the respective regions ; the Intertransversales, by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar nerves; the Multifidus spinse, by the same, with the addition of the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the sacral nerves. The Eecti and Obliqui muscles are all supplied by the suboccipital nerve ; the Inferior oblique is also supplied by the great occipital nerve. Actions.—When both the Spinales dorsi contract, they extend the dorsal region of the spine; when only one muscle contracts, it helps to bend the dorsal portion of the spine to one side. The Erector spinae, comprising the Ilio-costalis and the Longissimus dorsi with their accessory muscles, serves, as its name imphes, to maintain the spine in the erect posture ; it also serves to bend the trunk back- wards when it is required to counterbalance the influence of any weight at the front of' the body, as, for instance, when a heavy weight is suspended from the neck, or when there is any great abdominal distension, as in pregnancy or dropsy ; the peculiar gait under such circumstances depends upon the spine being drawn backwards, by the counterbalancing action of the Erector spinas muscles. The muscles which form the continuation of the Erector spinae upwards steady the head and neck, and fix them in the upright position. If the Ilio-costalis and Longissimus dorsi of one side act, they serve to draw down the chest and spine to the corresponding side. The Cervicales ascendens, taking their fixed points from the cervical vertebrae, elevate those ribs to which they are attached; taking their fixed points from the ribs, both muscles help to extend the neck ; while one muscle bends the neck to its own side. The Transversalis colli, when both muscles act, taking their fixed point from below, bend the neck backwards. The Trachelo- mastoid, when both muscles act, taking their fixed point from below, bend the head backwards; while, if only one muscle acts, the face is turned to the side on which the muscle is acting, and then the head is bent to the shoulder. The two Eecti muscles draw the head backwards. The Eectus capitis posticus major, owing to its obliquity, rotates the cranium, with the atlas, round the odontoid process, turning the face to the same side. The Multifidus spinae acts successively upon the different parts of the spine ; thus, the sacrum furnishes a fixed point from which the fasciculi of this muscle act upon the lumbar region; these then become the fixed points for the fasciculi moving the dorsal region, and so on throughout the entire length of the spine; it is by the successive contraction and relaxation of the separate fasciculi of this and other muscles that the spine preserve^ the erect posture without the fatigue that would necessarily have been produced had this position been maintained by the action of a single muscle. The Multifidus spin«, besides preserving the erect position of the spine, serves to rotate it, so that the front of the trunk is turned to the side opposite to that from which the muscle acts, this muscle being assisted in its action by the Obliquus externus abdominis. The Complexi draw the head directly backward ; if one muscle acts, it draws E EMUSCLES AND FASCIA 4x8 the head to one side, and rotates it so that the face is turned to the opposite side. The Superior ohhque draws the head backwards ; and, from the obhquity in the direction of its fibres, will slightly rotate the cranium, turning the face to the opposite side. The Obliquus capitis inferior rotates the atlas, and with it the cranium, round the odontoid process, turning the face to the same side. The Semispinals, when the muscles of the two sides act together, help to extend the spine ; when the muscles of one side only act, they rotate the dorsal and cervical parts of the spine, turning the body to the opposite side. The Supraspinales and Interspinales by approximating the spinous processes help to extend the spine. The Intertransversales approximate the transverse processes, and help to bend the spine to one side. The Eotatores spinae assist the Multifidus spinae to rotate the spine, so that the front of the trunk is turned to the side opposite to that from which the muscle acts. Surface Forms.—The surface forms produced by the muscles of the back are numerous and difficult to analyse unless they are considered in systematic order. The most super- ficial layer, consisting of large strata of muscular substance, influences to a certain extent the surface form, and at the same time reveals the forms of the layers beneath. The Traijezius at the upper part of the back, and in the neck, covers over and softens down the outline of the underlying muscles. Its anterior border forms the posterior boundary of the posterior triangle of the neck. It forms a slight undulating ridge which passes downwards and forwards from the occiput to the junction of the middle and outer third of the clavicle. The tendinous ellipse formed by a part of the origin of the two muscles at the back of the neck is always to be seen as an oval depression, more marked when the muscle is in action. A slight dimple on the skin opposite the interval between the spinous processes of the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae marks the triangular aponeurosis by which the inferior fibres are inserted into the root of the spine of the scapula. From this point the inferior border of the muscle may be traced as an undulating ridge to the spinous process of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. In like manner, the Latissimus dorsi softens down and modulates the underlying structures at the lower part of the back and lower part of the side of the chest. In this way it modulates the outline of the Erector spinffi ; of the Serratus posticus inferior, which is sometimes to be discerned through it, and is sometimes entirely obscured by it; of part of the Serratus magnus and Superior oblique, which it covers, and of the convex oblique ridges formed by the ribs with the intervening intercostal spaces. The anterior border of the muscle is the only part which gives a distinct surface form. This border may be traced, when the muscle is in action, as a rounded edge, starting from the crest of the ilium, and passing obliquely forwards and upwards to the posterior border of the axilla, where it combines with the Teres major in forming a thick roimded fold, the posterior boundary of the axillary space. The muscles in the second layer influence to a very considerable extent the surface form of the back of the neck and upper part of the trunk. The Levator anguli scajjulce reveals itself as a prominent divergent line, running downwards and outwards, from the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae to the angle of the scapula, covered over and toned down by the overlying Trapezius. The Bhomboidei produce, when in action, a vertical eminence between the internal border of the scapula and the spinal furrow, varying in intensity according to the condition of contraction or relaxation of the Trapezius muscle, by which they are for the most part covered. The lowermost part of the Ehomboideus major is uncovered by the Trapezius and forms on the surface an oblique ridge running upwards and inwards from the inferior angle of the scapula. Of the muscles of the third layer of the back, the Serratus posticus superior does not in any way influence surface form. The Serrattts jwsticus inferior, when in strong action, may occasionally be revealed as an elevation beneath the Latissimus dorsi. Tlie Splenii by their divergence serve to broaden out the upper part of the back of the neck and produce a local fulness in this situation, but do not otherwise influence surface form. Beneath all these muscles those of the fourth layer—the Erector spincB and its continuations—influence the surface form in a decided manner. In the loins, the Erector spinae, bound down by the lumbar fascia, forms a rounded vertical eminence, which determines the depth of the spinal furrow, and which below tapers to a point on the posterior surface of the sacrum and becomes lost there. In the back it forms a flattened plane which gradually becomes lost. In the neck the only part of this group of muscles which influences surface form is the Trachelo- mastoid, which produces a short convergent line across the upper part of the posterior triangle of the neck, appearing from under cover of the posterior border of the Sterno- mastoid and being lost below beneath the Trapezius.OF THE THORAX 419 Muscles and Fascia of the Thorax The Muscles exclusively connected with the bones in this region are few in number. They are the Intercostales externi. Infracostales. Intercostales interni. Triangularis sterni. Levatores costarum. Intercostal fasciae.—A thin but firm layer of fascia covers the outer surface of the External intercostal and the inner surface of the Internal intercostal muscles ; and a third layer, the middle intercostal fascia, more delicate, is interposed between the two planes of muscular fibres. These are the intercostal fasciae ; they are best marked in those situations where the muscular fibres are deficient, as between the External intercostal muscles and sternum, in front; and between the Internal intercostals and spine, behind. The Intercostal muscles (fig. 299) are two thin planes of muscular and tendinous fibres, placed one over the other, filling up the intercostal spaces, and being directed obliquely between the margins of the adjacent ribs. They have received the name ' external' and ' internal,' from the position they bear to one another. The tendinous fibres are longer and more numerous than the muscular ; hence the walls of the intercostal spaces possess very considerable strength, to which the crossing of the muscular fibres materially contributes. The External intercostals are eleven in number on each side. They extend from the tubercles of the ribs, behind, to the commencement of the cartilages of the ribs, in front, where they terminate in a thin membranous aponeurosis, which is continued forwards to the sternum. They arise from the lower border of each rib, and are inserted into the upper border of the rib below. In the two lowest spaces they extend to the end of the cartilages. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and forwards, in a similar direction with those of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen. They are thicker than the Internal intercostals. Relations.—By their outer surface, with the muscles which immediately invest the chest, viz. the Pectoralis major and minor, Serratus magnus, and Rhomboideus major, Serratus posticus superior and inferior. Scalenus posticus, Ilio-costalis, Longissimus dorsi, Cervicalis ascendens, Transversalis colli, Levatores costarum, and the Obliquus externus abdominis. By their internal stirface, with the middle intercostal fascia, which separates them from the intercostal vessels and nerve, and the Internal intercostal muscles, and, behind, from the pleura. The Internal intercostals are also eleven in number on each side. They commence anteriorly at the sternum, in the interspaces between the cartilages of the true ribs, and from the anterior extremities of the cartilages of the false ribs, and extend backwards as far as the angles of the ribs ; whence they are continued to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis. They arise from the ridge on the inner surface of each rib, as well as from the corresponding costal cartilage, and are inserted into the upper border of the rib below. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and backwards passing in the opposite direction to the fibres of the External intercostal muscle. Relations.—By their external surface, with the intercostal vessels and nerves, and the middle intercostal fascia, which separates them from the External inter- costal muscles. By their internal surface, with the internal intercostal fascia, which separates them from the pleura costalis, Triangularis sterni, and Diaphragm. The Infracostales (subcostales) consist of muscular and aponeurotic fasciculi, which vary in number and length : they are placed on the inner surface of the ribs, where the Internal intercostal muscles cease ; they arise from the inner surface of one rib, and are inserted into the inner surface of the first, second, or third rib below. Their direction is most usually oblique, like the Internal intercostals. They are most frequent between the lower ribs. E E 2MUSCLES AND FASCIA 420 The Triangularis sterni is a thin plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, situated upon the inner wall of the front of the chest. It arises from the lower part of the side of the sternum, from the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage, and from the sternal ends of the costal cartilages of the three or four lower true ribs. Its fibres diverge upwards and outwards, to be inserted by fleshy digitations into the lower border and inner surfaces of the costal cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. The lowest fibres of this muscle are horizontal in their direction, and are continuous with those of the Transversalis; those Avhich succeed are oblique, whilst the superior fibres are almost vertical. This muscle Fig. 289.—Posterior surface of sternum and costal cartilages, sliowmg Triangularis sterni muscle. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.) SCALENUS MEDIUS I varies much in its attachment, not only in different bodies, but on opposite sides of the same body. Relations.—In front, with the sternum, ensiform cartilage, costal cartilages. Internal intercostal muscles, and internal mammary vessels. Behind, with the pleura, pericardium, and anterior mediastinum. The Levatores Costarum (fig. 288), twelve in number on each side, are small tendinous and fleshy bundles, which arise from the extremities of the transverse processes of the seventh cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae, and, passing obliquely downwards and outwards, are inserted into the upper border of the rib below them, between the tubercle and the angle. That for the first rib arises421 DIAPHRAGM from the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and that for the last from the eleventh dorsal. The Inferior levatores divide into two fasciculi, one of which is inserted as above described ; the other fasciculus passes down to the second rib below its origin; thus, each of the lower ribs receives fibres from the transverse processes of two vertebrae. Nerves.—The muscles of this group are supplied by the intercostal nerves. Actions.—The Intercostals are the chief agents in the movement of the ribs in ordinary respiration. When the first rib is elevated and fixed by the Scaleni, the External intercostals raise the other ribs, especially their fore part, and so increase the capacity of the chest from before baclnvards ; at the same time they evert their lower borders, and so enlarge the thoracic cavity transversely. The Internal intercostals, at the side of the thorax, depress the ribs, and invert their lower borders, and so diminish the thoracic cavity ; but at the fore part of the chest these muscles assist the External intercostals in raising the cartilages.* The Levatores costarum assist the External intercostals in raising the ribs. The Triangularis sterni draws down the costal cartilages; it is therefore an expiratory muscle. Muscles of Inspiration and Expiration.—^The muscles which assist the action of the Diaphragm in ordinary tranquil inspiration are the Intercostals and the Levatores costarum, as above stated, and the Scaleni. When the need for more forcible action exists, the shoulders and the base of the scapula are fixed, and then the powerful muscles of forced inspiration come into play; the chief of these are the Trapezius, the Pectoralis minor, the Serratus posticus superior and inferior, and the Rhomboidei. The lower fibres of the Serratus magnus may possibly assist slightly in dilating the chest by raising and everting the ribs. The Sterno- mastoid also, when the head is fixed, assists in forced inspiration, by drawing up the sternum, and by fixing the clavicle, and thus affording a fixed point for the action of the muscles of the chest. The Ilio-costalis and Quadratus lumborum assist in forced inspiration by fixing the last rib (see page 436). The ordinary action of expiration is hardly effected by muscular force, but results from a return of the walls of the thorax to a condition of rest, owing to their own elasticity and to that of the lungs. Forced expiratory actions are performed mainly by the flat muscles (Obliqui and Transversalis) of the abdomen, assisted also by the Rectus. Other muscles of forced expiration are the Internal intercostals and Triangularis sterni (as above mentioned), the Quadratus lumborum, and the Ilio-costalis. Diaphragmatic Region Diaphragm. The Diaphragm (Sta<^pay/x,a, a partition wall) (fig. 290) is a thin musculo- fibrous septum, placed obliquely at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the trunk, and separating the thorax from the abdomen, forming the floor of the former cavity and the roof of the latter. It is elliptical, its longest diameter being * The view of the action of the Intercostal muscles given in the text is that which is taught by Hutchinson (Cycl. of Anat. and Phys. art. ' Thorax'), and is usually adopted in our schools. It is, however, much disputed. Hamberger believed that the External intercostals act as elevators of the ribs, or muscles of inspnation, while the Internal act in expiration. Haller taught that both sets of muscles act in common—viz. as muscles of inspiration—and this view is adopted by many of the best anatomists of the Continent, and appears supported by many observations made on the human subject under various conditions of disease, and on living animals after the muscles have been exposed under chloroform. The reader may consult an interesting paper by Dr. Cleland in the Journal of Anat. and Phys. No. II., Ma}^ 1867, p. 209, ' On the Hutchinsonian Theory of the Action of the Intercostal Muscles,' who refers also to Henle, Luschka, Budge, and Baumler, Observations on the Action of the Intercostal Muscles., Erlangen, i860. (In Netv Syd. Soc's. Year-Booh for 1861, p. 69.) Dr. W. W. Keen has come to the con- clusion, from experiments made upon a criminal executed by hangmg, that the External intercostals are muscles of expiration, as they pulled the ribs down, while the Internal intercostals pulled the ribs up and are muscles of inspiration. {Trans. Coll. Phys. Philadelphia, Third Series, vol. i., 1875, p. 97.)MUSCLES AND FASCIA 422 from side to side, somewhat fan-shaped, the broad elUptical portion being hori- zontal, the narrow part, which represents the handle of the fan, vertical, and joined at right angles to the former. It is from this circumstance that some anatomists describe it as consisting of two portions, the upper or great muscle of the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax; being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform cartilage ; on either side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or seven inferior ribs, interdigitating with the Transver- salis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum et internmn, and to the lumbar vertebra. The fibres from these sources vary in length ; those arising from the ensiform appendix are very short and Fig. 290.—The Diaphragm. Under surface. occasionally aponeurotic; those from the ligamenta arcuata, and more especially those from the cartilages of the ribs at the side of the chest, are longer, describe well-marked curves as they ascend, and finally converge to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon. Between the sides of the muscular slip from the ensiform appendix and the cartilages of the adjoining ribs, the fibres of the Diaphragm are deficient, the interval being filled by areolar tissue, covered on the thoracic side by the pleurge; on the abdominal, by the peritoneum. This is, consequently, a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen may protrude into the chest, forming phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia, or a collection of pus in the mediastinum may descend through it, so as to point at the epigastrium. The ligamentum arcuatujn internum is a tendinous arch, thrown across the upper part of the Psoas magnus muscle, on each side of the spine. It is connected, by one end, to the outer side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, beingDIAPHKAGM -^^1^^ 4^3 continuous with the outer side of the tendon of the corresponding crus; and, by the other end, to the front of the transverse process of the first and sometimes also to that of the second, lumbar vertebra. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is the thickened upper margin of the ante- rior lamella of the lumbar fascia ; it arches across the upper part of the Quadratus lumborum, being attached, by one extremity, to the front of the transverse process of the first lum.bar vertebra; and, by the other, to the apex and lower margin of the last rib. The Crura.—The Diaphragm is connected to the spine by two crura pillars, which are situated on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, on each side of the aorta. The crura, at their origin, are tendinous in structure ; the right crus, larger and longer than the left, arising from the anterior surface of the bodies and inter- vertebral substances of the three or four upper lumbar vertebra ; the left, from the two upper; both blending with the anterior common ligament of the spine. These tendinous portions of the crura pass forwards and inwards and gradually converge to meet in the middle line, forming an arch, beneath which passes the aorta, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. From this tendinous arch muscular fibres arise, which diverge, the outermost portion being directed upwards and outwards to the central tendon ; the innermost decussating in front of the aorta, and then diverging, so as to surround the oesophagus before ending in the central tendon. The fibres derived from the right crus are the most numerous and pass in front of those derived from the left. The Ce7itral or Gordiform Tendon of the Diaphragm is a thin but strong- tendinous aponeurosis, situated at the centre of the vault formed by the muscle, immediately below the pericardium, with which its circumference is blended. It is shaped somewhat like a trefoil leaf, consisting of three divisions, or leaflets, separated from one another by slight indentations. The right leaflet is the largest: the middle one, directed towards the ensiform cartilage, the next in size ; and the left, the smallest. In structure, the tendon is composed of several planes of fibres, which intersect one another at various angles, and unite into straight or curved bundles—an arrangement which affords it additional strength. The Openings connected with the Diaphragm are three large and several smaller apertures. The former are the aortic, the oesophageal, and the opening for the vena cava. The aortic opening is the lowest and the most posterior of the three large aper- tures connected with this muscle. It is situated in the middle line, immediately in front of the bodies of the vertebrae ; and is, therefore, behind the Diaphragm, not in it. It is an osseo-aponeurotic aperture, formed by a tendinous arch thrown across the front of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the crus on one side to that on the other, and transmits the aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct, and sometimes the left sympathetic nerve. Occasionally some tendinous fibres are prolonged across the bodies of the vertebrae from the inner part of the lower end of the crura, passing behind the aorta, and thus converting the opening into a fibrous ring. The oesophageal opening, elliptical in form, muscular in structure, and formed by the two crura, is placed above, and, at the same time, anterior, and a little to the left of the preceding. It transmits the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves. The anterior margin of this aperture is occasionally tendinous, being formed by the margin of the central tendon. The opening for the vena cava (foramen quadratum) is the highest; it is quadri- lateral in form, tendinous in structure, and placed at the junction of the right and middle leaflets of the central tendon, its margins being bounded by four bundles of tendinous fibres, which meet at right angles. The right cms transmits the sympathetic and the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of the right side; the left crus, the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of the left side, and the vena azygos minor. The Serous Membranes in relation with the Diaphragm are four in number:424 MUSCLES AND FASCIA three lining its upper or thoracic surface ; one, its abclominaL The three serous membranes on its upper surface are the pleura on either side, and the serous layer of the pericardium, which covers the middle portion of the tendinous centre. The serous membrane covering its under surface is a portion of the general peritoneal membrane of the abdominal cavity. The Diaphragm is arched, being convex towards the chest, and concave to the abdomen. The right iwrtion forms a complete arch from before backwards, being accurately moulded over the convex surface of the liver, and having resting upon it the concave base of the right lung. The left portion is arched from before backwards in a similar manner ; but the arch is narrower in front, being encroached upon by the pericardium, and lower than the right, at its summit, by about three-quarters of an inch. It supports the base of the left lung, and covers the great end of the stomach, the spleen, and left kidney. At its circumference the Diaphragm is higher in the mesial line of the body than at either side ; but in the middle of the thorax, the central portion, which supports the heart, is on a lower level than the two lateral portions. Nerves.—The Diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves and phrenic plexus of the sympathetic. Actions.—The Diaphragm is the principal muscle of inspiration. When in a condition of rest the muscle presents a domed surface, concave towards the abdo- men ; and consists of a circumferential muscular and a central tendinous part. When the muscular fibres contract, they become less arched, or nearly straight, and thus cause the central tendon to descend, and in consequence the level of the chest wall is lowered, the vertical diameter of the chest being proportionally increased. In this descent the different parts of the tendon move unequally. The left leaflet descends to the greatest extent; the right to a less extent, on account of the liver; and the central leaflet the least, because of its connection to the pericardium. In descending the diaphragm presses on the abdominal viscera, and so to a certain extent causes a projection of the abdominal wall; but in conse- quence of these viscera not yielding completely, the central tendon becomes a fixed point, and enables the circumferential muscular fibres to act from it, and so elevate the lower ribs and expand the lower part of the thoracic cavity ; and Duchenne has shown that the Diaphragm has the power of elevating the ribs, to which it is attached, by its contraction, if the abdominal viscera are in situ, but that if these organs are removed, this power is lost. When at the end of inspiration, the Diaphragm relaxes, the thoracic walls return to their natural position in conse- quence of their elastic reaction and of the elasticity and weight of the displaced viscera.* In all expulsive acts the Diaphragm is called into action, to give additional power to each expulsive effort. Thus, before sneezing, coughing, laughing, and crying; before vomiting; previous to the expulsion of the urine and faeces, or of the foetus from the womb, a deep inspiration takes place. The height of the Diaphragm is constantly varying during respiration, the muscle being carried upwards or downwards from the average level; its height also A^aries according to the degree of distension of the stomach and intestines, and the size of the liver. After a forced expiration, the right arch is on a level, in front with the fourth costal cartilage ; at the side, with the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs ; and behind with the eighth rib; the left arch being usually from one to two ribs' breadth below the level of the right one. In a forced inspiration, it descends from one to two inches; its slope would then be represented by a line drawn from the ensiform cartilage towards the tenth rib. * For a detailed description of the general relations of the Diaphragm, and its action, refer to Dr. Sibson's Medical Anatomy.OF THE ABDOMEN 425 Superficial Muscles of the Abdomen The Muscles in this region are, the Obliquus Externus. Obliquus Internus. Pyramidali; Transversalis. Rectus. Fig. 291.—Dissection of abdomen. Dissection (fig. 291).—To dissect the abdominal muscles, make a vertical incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes ; a second incision from the umbilicus obliquely upwards and outwards to the outer surface of the chest, as high as the lower border of the fifth or sixth rib ; and a third, commencing midwa}^ between the umbilicus and pubes, transversely outwards to the anterior superior iliac spine, and along the crest of the ilium as far as its posterior third. Then reflect the three flaps included between these incisions from within outwards, in the lines of direction of the muscular fibres. If necessary, the abdominal muscles may be made tense by inflating the peritoneal cavity through the umbilicus. The Superficial fascia of the abdomen con- sists over the greater part of the abdominal wall of a single layer of fascia, which contains a variable amount of fat; but as this layer ap- 3 j) proaches the groin it is easily divisible into two section of[ layers, between which are found the superficial ^SSa V\ vessels and nerves and the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands. The superficial layer is thick, areolar in texture, containing adipose tissue in its meshes, the quantity of which varies in different subjects. Below it passes over Pou- part's ligament, and is continuous with the outer layer of the superficial fascia of the thigh. In the male this fascia is continued over the penis and outer surface of the Cord to the scrotum, where it helps to form the dartos. As it passes to the scrotum it changes its character, becoming thin, destitute of adipose tissue and of a pale reddish colour, and in the scrotum it acquires some involuntary muscular fibres. From the scrotum it may be traced backwards to be continuous with the superficial fascia of the perinasum. In the female, this fascia is continued into the labia majora. The deeper layer (fascia of Scarpa) is thinner and more membranous in character than the superficial layer. In the middle line, it is intimately adherent to the linea alba ; above, it is continuous with the superficial fascia over the rest of the trunk; below, it blends with the fascia lata of the thigh a little below Poupart's ligament ; and below and internally, it is continued over the penis and spermatic cord to the scrotum, where it helps to form the dartos. From the scrotum it may be traced backwards to be continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinseum. In the female, it is continued into the labia majora. The External or Descending Oblique Muscle (fig. 292) is situated on the side and fore part of the abdomen ; being the largest and the most superficial of the three flat muscles in this region. It is broad, thin, and irregularly quadrilateral, its muscular portion occupying the side, its aponeu-rosis the anterior wall of the abdomen. It arises, by eight fleshy digitations, from the external surface and lower borders of the eight inferior ribs; these digitations are arranged in an oblique line running downwards and back^vards; the upper ones being attached close to the cartilages of the corresponding ribs ; the lowest, to the apex of the cartilage of the last rib ; the intermediate ones, to the ribs at some distance from426 MUSCLES AND FASCIA their cartilages. The five superior serrations increase in size from above'down- wards, and are received between corresponding processes of the Serratus magnus • the three lower ones diminish in size from above downwards, receiving between them corresponding processes from the Latissimus dorsi. From these attachments the fleshy fibres proceed in various directions. Those from the lowest ribs pass nearly vertically downwards, to be inserted into the anterior half of the outer Hp of the crest of the ihum ; the middle and upper fibres, directed downwards and forwards, terminate in tendinous fibres, opposite a line drawn from the prominence Ficx. 292.—The External obhque muscle. External abdominal ring Gimbernat's liga^nent j of the ninth costal cartilage to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, which then spread out into a broad aponeurosis. The Aponeurosis of the External Oblique is a thin, but strong membranous aponeurosis the fibres of which are directed obliquely downwards and outwards. It IS joined with that of the opposite muscle along the median line, covers the whole of the front of the abdomen ; above, it is connected with the lower border ot the Pectorahs major; below, its fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend obhquely across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine427 OF THE ABDOMEN of the OS pubis and the hnea iUo-pectinea. In the median hne, it interlaces with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle, forming the linea alba, which extends from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the os pubis is a broad band, folded inwards, and continuous below with the fascia lata ; it is called Poupart's ligament. The portion Avhich is reflected from Poupart's ligament at the spine of the os pubis along the pectineal line is called GimhernaVs ligament. From the point of attach- ment of the latter to the pectineal line, a few fibres pass upwards and inwards, behind the inner pillar of the ring, to the linea alba. They diverge as they ascend, and form a thin, triangular, fibrous band, which is called the triangular ligament of the abdomen. In the aponeurosis of the External oblique, immediately above the crest of the OS pubis, is a triangular opening, the external abdominal ring, formed by a separation of the fibres of the aponeurosis in this situation. Relations.—By its external surface, with the superficial fascia, superficial epigastric and circumflex iliac vessels, and some cutaneous nerves. By its internal surface, with the Internal oblique, the lower part of the eight inferior ribs, and Intercostal muscles, the Cremaster, the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female. Its jwsterior border, extending from the last rib to the crest of the ilium, is fleshy throughout and free; it is occasionally overlapped by the Latissimus dorsi, though generally a triangular interval exists between the two muscles near the crest of the ilium in. which is seen a portion of the internal oblique. This triangle, Petit's triangle, is therefore bounded in front by the External obhque, behind by the Latissimus dorsi, below by the crest of the ihum, while its floor is formed by the Internal oblique (fig. 287). The following parts of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle require to be further described, viz. the external abdominal ring, the intercolumnar fibres and fascia, Poupart's ligament, Gimbernat's Hgament, and the triangular ligament of the abdomen. The External Abdominal Ring.—Just above, and to the outer side of the crest of the OS pubis, an interval is seen in the aponeurosis of the External oblique, called the External abdominal ring. The aperture is oblique in direction, somewhat triangular in form, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It usually measures from base to apex about an inch, and transversely about half an inch. It is bounded below by the crest of the os pubis ; above, by a series of curved fibres, the intercolumnar, which pass across the upper angle of the ring, so as to increase its strength; and on each side, by the margins of the opening in the aponeurosis, which are called the columns or pillars of the ring. The external pillar, which is at the same time inferior from the obliquity of its direction, is the stronger : it is formed by that portion of Poupart's ligament which is inserted into the spine of the os pubis ; it is curved so as to form a kind of groove, upon which the spermatic cord rests. The internal or superior pillar is a broad, thin, flat band which is attached to the front of the symphysis pubis, interlacing with its fellow of the opposite side, that of the right side being superficial. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female : it is much larger in men than in women, on account of the large size of the spermatic cord, and hence the greater frequency of inguinal hernia in men. The intercolumnar fibres are a series of curved tendinous fibres, which arch across the lower part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique. They have received their name from stretching across between the two pillars of the external ring, describing a curve with the convexity downwards. They are much thicker and stronger at the outer margin of the external ring, where they are connected to the outer third of Poupart's ligament, than internally, where they are inserted into the linea alba. They are more strongly developed in the male than in theMUSCLES AND FASCIA 428 female. The intercolumnar fibres increase the strength of the lower part of the aponeurosis, and prevent the divergence of the pillars from one another. These intercolumnar fibres as they pass across the external abdominal ring are themselves connected together by delicate fibrous tissue, thus forming a fascia, which as it is attached to the pillars of the ring covers it in, and is called the intercolumnar fascia. This intercolumnar fascia is continued down as a tubular prolongation around the outer surface of the cord and testis, and encloses them in a distinct sheath,"hence it is also called the external spermatic fascia. The sac of an inguinal hernia, in passing through the external abdominal ring, receives an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. If the finger is introduced a short distance into the external abdominal ring and the limb is then extended and rotated outw^ards, the aponeurosis of the External oblique together with the iliac portion of the fascia lata will be felt to become tense, and the external ring much contracted ; if the limb is on the contrary flexed upon the pelvis and rotated inwards, this aponeurosis will become lax and the external abdominal ring sufficiently enlarged to admit the finger with comparative ease : hence the patient should always be put in the latter position when the taxis is applied for the reduction of an inguinal hernia in order that the abdominal walls may be relaxed as much as possible. Poupart's ligament, or the crural arch, is the lower border of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which extends from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the os pubis. From this latter point it is reflected outwards to be attached to the pectineal line for about half an inch, forming Gimbernat's ligament. Its general direction is curved downwards towards the thigh, where it is continuous with the fascia lata. Its outer half is rounded and oblique in direction. Its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the os pubis, is more horizontal in direction, and lies beneath the spermatic cord. Nearly the whole of the space included between the crural arch and the innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdomen into the thigh. These will be referred to again on a subsequent page. Gimbernat's ligament is that part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle which is reflected downwards and outwards from the spine of the os pubis to be inserted into the pectineal line. It is about half an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form with the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin, and sharp, and lies in contact with the crural sheath. Its apex corresponds to the spine of the os pubis. Its posterior margin is attached to the pectineal line, and is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its anterior margin is continuous with Poupart's ligament. The triangular ligament of the abdomen is a band of tendinous fibres of a triangular shape, which is attached by its apex to the pectineal line, where it is continuous with Gimbernat's ligament. It passes inw^ards beneath the spermatic cord, and expands into a somewhat fan-shaped fascia, lying behind the inner pillar of the external abdominal ring, and in front of the conjoined tendon, and interlaces with the ligament of the other side at the linea alba. Dissection.—Detach the External oblique by dividing it across, just in front of its attachment to the ribs, as far as its posterior border, and separate it below from the crest of the ilium as far as the anterior superior spine ; then separate the muscle carefully from the Internal oblique, which lies beneath, and turn it towards the opposite side. The Internal or Ascending oblique muscle (fig. 293), thinner and smaller than the preceding, beneath which it lies, is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, and situated at the side and fore part of the abdomen. It arises, by fleshy fibres, from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, being attached to the groove on its upper surface ; from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. From this origin the fibres diverge: those from Poupart's ligament, few in number, and paler in colourOF THE ABDOMEN 429 than the rest, arch downwards and inwards across the spermatic cord, and, becoming tendinous, are inserted, conjointly with those of the Transversalis, into the crest of the OS pubis and pectineal line, to the extent of half an inch, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and TransversaHs ; those from the anterior third of the iliac origin are horizontal in their direction, and, becoming tendinous along the lower fourth of the linea semilunaris, pass in front of the Eectus muscle to be inserted into the linea alba ; those which arise from the middle third of the origin from the crest of the ilium pass obliquely upwards and inwards, and terminate in an aponeurosis, which divides opposite the linea semilunaris into two lamellaB, which are continued forwards, in front and behind the Eectus muscle to the linea alba ; the posterior lamella being also connected to the cartilages Fig. 293.—The Internal oblique muscle. of the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs; the most posterior fibres pass almost vertically upwards, to be inserted into the lower borders of the cartilages of the three lower ribs, being continuous with the Internal intercostal muscles. The conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis is inserted into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, immediately behind the external abdominal ring, serving to protect what would otherwise be a weak point in the abdominal wall. Sometimes this tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and is carried forward in front of the protrusion through the external ring, forming one of the coverings of direct inguinal hernia; or the hernia forces its way through the fibres of the conjoined tendon. The aponeurosis of the Internal oblique is continued forward to the middle line of the abdomen, where it joins with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle at the430 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE linea alba, and extends from the margin of the thorax to the os pubis. At the outer margin of the Rectus muscle, this aponeurosis, for the upper three-fourths of its extent, divides into two lamellae, which pass, one in front and the other behind the muscle, enclosing it in a kind of sheath, and reuniting on its inner border at the linea alba ; the anterior layer is blended with the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle ; the posterior layer with that of the Transversalis. Along the lower fourth, the aponeurosis passes altogether in front of the Rectus without any separation. Relations.—By its external surface, with the External oblique, Latissimus dorsi, spermatic cord, and external ring. By its internal surface, with the Trans- versalis muscle, the lower intercostal vessels and nerves, the ilio-hypogastric and the ilio-inguinal nerves. Near Poupart's ligament, it lies on the fascia transversalis, internal ring, and spermatic cord. Its lower border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal. The Cremaster muscle is a thin muscular layer, composed of a number of fasciculi which arise from the middle of Poupart's ligament at the inner side of the Internal oblique, being connected with that muscle, and also occasionally with the Transversalis. It passes along the outer side of the spermatic cord, descends with it through the external abdominal ring upon the front and sides of the cord, and forms a series of loops which differ in thickness and length in different subjects. Those at the upper part of the cord are exceedingly short, but they become in succession longer and longer, the longest reaching down as low as the testicle, where a few are inserted into the tunica vaginalis. These loops are united together by areolar tissue, and form a thin covering over the cord and testis, the fascia cremasterica. The fibres ascend along the inner side of the cord, and are inserted by a small pointed tendon into the crest of the os pubis and front of the sheath of the Rectus muscle. It will be observed that the origin and insertion of the Cremaster is precisely similar to that of the lower fibres of the Internal oblique. This fact affords an easy explanation of the manner in which the testicle and cord are invested by this muscle. At an early period of foetal life the testis is placed at the lower and back part of the abdominal cavity, but during its descent towards the scrotum, which takes place before birth, it passes beneath the arched fibres of the Internal oblique. In its passage beneath this muscle some fibres are derived from its lower part which accompany the testicle and cord into the scrotum. It occasionally happens that the loops of the Cremaster surround the cord, some lying behind as well as in front. It is probable that under these circumstances the testis, in its descent, passed through instead of beneath the fibres of the Internal oblique. In the descent of an oblique inguinal hernia, which takes the same course as the spermatic cord, the Cremaster muscle forms one of its coverings. This muscle becomes largely developed in cases of hydrocele and large old scrotal hernia. No such muscle exists in the female, but an analogous structure is developed in those cases where an oblique inguinal hernia descends beneath the margin of the Internal oblique. Dissection.—Detach the Internal oblique in order to expose the Transversalis beneath. This may be effected by dividing the muscle, above, at its attachment to the ribs ; below, at its connection with Poupart's ligament and the crest of the ilium ; and behind, by a vertical incision extending from the last rib to the crest of the ilium. The muscle should previously be made tense by drawing upon it with the fingers of the left. hand, and if its division is carefully effected, the cellular interval between it and the Transversalis, as well as the direction of the fibres of the latter muscle, will afford a clear guide to their separation ; along the crest of the ilium the circumflex iliac vessels are interposed between them, and form an important guide in separating them. The muscle should then be thrown forwards towards the linea alba. The Transversalis muscle (fig. 294), so called from the direction of its fibres, is the most internal flat muscle of the abdomen, being placed immediately beneath the Internal oblique. It arises by fleshy fibres from the outer third of Poupart's ligament; from the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, for its anterior three-OF THE ABDOMEN 431 fourths ; from the inner surface of the cartilages of the six lower ribs, interdigitating with the Diaphragm ; and by the lumbar fascia from the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The muscle terminates in front in a broad aponeurosis, the lower fibres of which curve downwards and inwards, and are inserted, together with those of the Internal oblique, into the lower part of the linea alba, the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis. Throughout the Fig. 294.—The Transversalis, Rectus, and Pyramidalis muscles. rest of its extent the aponeurosis j)asses horizontally inwards, and is inserted into the linea alba; its upper three-fourths passing behind the Rectus muscle, blending with the posterior lamella of the Internal oblique; its lower fourth passing in front of the Rectus. Relations.—By its external surface, with the Internal oblique, and the inner surface of the cartilages of the lower ribs. By its internal stirface, with the fascia transversalis, which separates it from the peritoneum. Its lower border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 432 Dissection.—To expose the Kectus muscle, open its sheath by a vertical incision extending from the margin of the thorax to the os pubis, and then reflect the two portions from the surface of the muscle, which is easily done, excepting at the linefe transversae, where so close an adhesion exists that the greatest care is requisite in separating them. Now raise the outer edge of the muscle, in order to examine the posterior layer of the sheath. By dividing the muscle in the centre, and turning its lower part downwards, the point where the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin will be seen. The Rectus abdominis is a long flat muscle, which extends along the whole length of the front of the abdomen, being separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the linea alba. It is much broader, but thinner, above than below, and arises by two tendons, the external or larger being attached to the crest of the os pubis, the internal, smaller portion, interlacing with its fellow of the opposite side, and being connected with the ligaments covering the front of the symphysis pubis. The fibres ascend, and the muscle is inserted by three portions of unequal size into the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. Some fibres are occasion- ally connected with the costo-xiphoid ligaments, and side of the ensiform cartilage. The Eectus muscle is traversed by tendinous intersections, three in number, which have received the name of linecB transverscB. One of these is usually situated opposite the umbilicus, and two above that point ; of the latter, one corresponds to the extremity of the ensiform cartilage, and the other to the interval between the ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus. These intersections pass transversely or obliquely across the muscle in a zigzag course ; they rarely extend completely through its substance, sometimes pass only half-way across it, and are intimately adherent in front to the sheath in which the muscle is enclosed. The Eectus is enclosed in a sheath (fig. 295) formed by the aponeuroses of the Oblique and Transversalis muscles, which are arranged in the following manner. When the aponeurosis of the Internal oblique arrives at the outer margin of the Rectus, it divides into two lamellae, one of which passes in front of the Rectus, blending with the aponeurosis of the External oblique ; the other, behind it, blending with the aponeurosis of the Transversalis ; and these, joining again at its inner border, are inserted into the linea alba. This arrangement of the aponeuroses exists along the upper three-fourths of the muscle : at the commencement of the lower fourth, the posterior wall of the sheath terminates in a thin curved margin, the semilunar fold of Douglas, the concavity of which looks downwards towards the pubes; the aponeuroses of all three muscles passing in front of the Rectus without any separation. The extremities of the fold of Douglas descend as pillars to the OS pubis. The inner pillar is attached to the symphysis pubis ; the outer pillar, which is named by Braune the ligament of Hesselbach, divides below to enclose the internal abdominal ring; the internal fibres are attached to the horizontal ramus of the os pubis and the pectineal fascia; the external ones pass to the Psoas fascia and to the Transversalis where it arises from Poupart's ligament on the outer side of the ring. The Rectus muscle, in the situation where its sheath is deficient, is separated from the peritoneum by the transversalis fascia. The Pyramidalis is a small muscle, triangular in shape, placed at the lower part of the abdomen, in front of the Rectus, and contained in the same sheath with that muscle. It arises by tendinous fibres from the front of the os pubis and the anterior pubic ligament; the fleshy portion of the muscle passes upwards, diminishing in size as it ascends, and terminates by a pointed extremity, which is inserted into the linea alba, midway between the umbilicus and the os pubis. This muscle is sometimes found wanting on one or both sides ; the lower end of the Rectus then becomes proportionately increased in size. Occasionally it has been found double on one side, or the muscles of the two sides are of unequal size. Sometimes its length exceeds what is stated above. Relations.—Its anterior surface (or rather the fascia which covers its anterior surface) is in relation with the colon, the kidney, the Psoas muscle, and the Diaphragm. Its ]Josterior surface is in relation with the middle lamella of the433 OF THE ABDOMEN lumbar fascia, which separates it from the Erector spin^e. The Qnadratus lumbormii extends, however, beyond the outer border of the Erector spinaB. Nerves.—The abdominal muscles are supplied by the lower intercostal nerves. The Internal oblique also receives a filament from the ilio-inguinal nerve. The Cremaster is supplied by the genital branch of the Genito-crural. In the description of the abdominal muscles, mention has frequently been made of the linea alba, lineae semilunares, and linec^ transversae; when the dissection of the muscles is completed, these structures should be examined. The linea alba is a tendinous raphe seen along the middle line of the abdomen, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis, to which it is attached. It is placed between the inner borders of the Recti muscles, and is formed by the blending of the aponeuroses of the Obliqui and Transversales muscles. It is narrow below, corresponding to the narrow interval existing between the Becti; but broader above, as these muscles diverge from one another in their ascent, becoming of considerable breadth after great distension of the abdomen from pregnancy or ascites. It presents numerous apertures for the passage of vessels and nerves ; the largest of these is the umbilicus, which in the foetus transmits the umbilical vessels, but in the adult is obliterated, the cicatrix being stronger than Fig. 295.—A transverse section of the abdomen in the lumbar region. the neighbouring parts; hence umbilical hernia occurs in the adult near the umbilicus, whilst in the foetus it occurs at the umbilicus. The linea alba is in relation, in front, with the integument, to which it is adherent, especially at the umbilicus ; behind, it is separated from the peritoneum by the transversalis fascia ; and below, by the urachus, and the bladder when that organ is distended. The linese semilunares are two curved tendinous lines placed one on each side of the linea alba. Each corresponds with the outer border of the Rectus muscle, extends from the cartilage of the ninth rib to the pubic spine, and is formed by the apo- neurosis of the Internal oblique at its point of division to enclose the Rectus, where it is reinforced in front by the External oblique, and behind by the Transversalis. The lineae transversae are three narrow transverse lines which intersect the Recti muscles, as already mentioned; they connect the lineae semilunares with the linea alba. Actions.—The abdominal muscles perform a threefold action. When the pelvis and thorax are fixed, they compress the abdominal viscera, by constricting the cavity of the abdomen, in which action they are materially assisted by the descent of the diaphragm. By these means the foetus is expelled from the uterus, the faeces from the rectum, the urine from the bladder, and the contents of the stomach in vomiting. If the pelvis and spine are fixed, these muscles compress the lower part of the F F434 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE thorax, materially assisting expiration. If the pelvis alone is fixed, the thorax is hent directly forward, when the muscles of both sides act, or to either side when those of the two sides act alternately, rotation of the trunk at the same time taking place to the opposite side. If the thorax is fixed, these muscles, acting together, draw the pelvis upwards, as in climbing; or, acting singly, they draw the pelvis upwards, and rotate the vertebral column to one side or the other. The Eecti muscles, acting from below, depress the thorax, and consequently flex the vertebral column; when acting from above, they flex the pelvis upon the vertebral column. The Pyramidales are tensors of the linea alba. The fascia transversalis is a thin aponeurotic membrane which lies betw^een the inner surface of the Transversalis muscle and the peritoneum. It forms part of the general layer of fascia which lines the interior of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, and is directly continuous with the iliac and pelvic fasciae. In the inguinal region, the transversahs fascia is thick and dense in structure and joined by fibres from the aponeurosis of the Transversalis muscle, but it becomes thin and cellular as it ascends to the diaphragm. Below, it has the following attachments : external to the femoral vessels it is connected to the posterior margin of Poupart's hgament, and is there continuous with the iliac fascia. Internal to the femoral vessels it is thin and attached to the os pubis and pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendon, with which it is united; and, corresponding to the point where the femoral vessels pass into the thigh, this fascia descends in front of them, forming the anterior wall of the crural sheath. The spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female pass through this fascia, the point where they pass through is called the internal abdominal ring. This opening is not visible externally owing to a prolongation of the transversalis fascia on these structures forming the infundi- buliform process. The internal or deep abdominal ring is situated in the transversalis fascia, midw^ay between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the os pubis, and about half an inch above Poupart's ligament. It is of an oval form, the extremities of the oval directed upwards and downwards, varies in size in different subjects, and is much larger in the male than in the female. It is bounded, above and externally, by the arched fibres of the Transversalis; below and internally, by the deep epigastric vessels. It transmits the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female. From its circumference a thin funnel-shaped membrane, the infundihuliform fascia, is continued round the cord and testis, enclosing them in a distinct pouch. When the sac of an obliqiie inguinal hernia passes through the internal or deep abdominal ring, the infundibuliform process of the transversalis fascia forms one of its coverings. The inguinal or spermatic canal contains the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female. It is an oblique canal about an inch and a half in length, directed downw^ards and inwards, and placed parallel to and a little above Poupart's ligament. It commences above at the internal or deep abdominal ring, which is the point where the cord enters the spermatic canal, and terminates below at the external ring. It is bounded in front by the integument and superficial fascia, by the aponeurosis of the External oblique throughout its whole length, and by the Internal oblique for its outer third ; behind, by the triangular ligament, the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis, transversalis fascia, and the subperitoneal fat and peritoneum ; above, by the arched fibres of the Internal oblique and Transversalis; below, by the union of the fascia transversalis with Poupart's ligament. That form of protrusion in which the intestine follows the course of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal is called oblique inguinal hernia. The Deep Crural Arch.—Passing across the front of the crural arch, on the abdominal side of Poupart's ligament and closely connected with it, is a thickened band of fibres called the deep crural arch. It is apparently a thickening of theOF THE ABDOMEN F F 2 435 fascia transversalis, joining externally to the centre of Poupart's ligament, and arching across the front of the crirral sheath to be inserted by a broad attachment into the pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendons. In some subjects this structure is not very prominently marked, and not unfrequently it is altogether wanting. Surface Form.—The only two muscles of this group which have any considerable influ- ence on surface form are the External oblique and Kectus muscles of tlie abdomen. With regard to the External oblique, the upper digitations of its origin from the ribs are well marked, intermingled with the serrations of the Serratus magnus ; the lower digitations are not visible, being covered by the thick border of the Latissimus dorsi. Its attachment to the crest of the ilium, in conjunction with the Internal oblique, forms a thick oblique roll, which determines the iliac furrow. Sometimes on the front of the lateral region of the abdomen an undulating outline marks the spot where the muscular fibres terminate and the aponeurosis commences. The outer border of the Eectus is defined by the liiiea semi- lunaris, which may be exactly defined by putting the muscle into action. It corresponds with a curved line, with its convexity outwards, drawn from the lowest part of the cartilage of the seventh rib to the spine of the os pubis, so that the centre of the line, at or near the umbilicus, is three inches from the median line. The inner border of the Kectus corresponds to the Unea alba, marked on the surface of the body by a groove, the abdominal furroiu, which extends from the infrasternal fossa to, or to a little below, the umbilicus, where it gradually becomes lost. The surface of the Eectus presents three transverse furrows, the linece tra7isversce. The upper two of these, one opposite or a little below the tip of the ensiform cartilage, and another, midway between this point and the umbilicus, are usually well marked; the third, opposite the umbilicus, is not so distinct. The umbilicus, situated in the linea alba, varies very much in position as regards its height. It is always situated above a zone drawn round the body opposite the highest point of the crest of the ilium, generally being about three-quarters of an inch to an inch above this line. It generally corresponds, therefore, to the fibro-cartilage between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Deep Muscles of the Abdomen Psoas parvus. Iliacus. Psoas magnus. Quadratus lumborum. The Psoas magnus, the Psoas parvus, and the Iliacus muscles, with the fascia covering them, will be described with the Muscles of the Lower Extremity (see page 482). The fascia covering the Q,uadratus lumborum.—This is the most internal of the two layers of fascia Avhich are given oif from the anterior or deep surface of the lumbar fascia. It is a thin layer of fascia which, passing over the anterior surface of the Quadratus lumborum, is attached, internally, to the anterior surface of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra ; below, to the ilio-lumbar ligament ; and above, to the apex and lower border of the last rib. The portion of this fascia which extends from the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the apex and lower border of the last rib, constitutes the ligamentum arcuatum externum. The Quadratus lumborum (fig. 288, page 411) is situated in the lumbar region. It is irregularly quadrilateral in shape, and broader below than above. It arises by aponeurotic fibres from the ilio-lumbar ligament and the adjacent portion of the crest of the ihiim for about two inches, and is inserted into the lower border of the last rib for about half its length and by four small tendons, into the apices of the transverse processes of the four upper lumbar vertebrae. Occasionally a second portion of this muscle is found situated in front of the preceding. It arises from the upper borders of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and is inserted into the lower margin of the last rib. The Quadratus lumborum is contained in a sheath formed by the anterior and middle lamella of the lumbar fasciae. Relations.—Its anterior surface (or rather the fascia which covers its anterior surface) is in relation with the colon, the kidney, the Psoas muscle, and the Diaphragm. Its posterior surface is in relation with the middle lamella of the lumbar fascia, Avhich separates it from the Erector spinte. The Quadratus lumborum extends, however, beyond the outer border of the Erector spinae. Nerve-supply.—The anterior branches of the lumbar nerves.436 MUSCLES AND FASCI.E Actions.—The Quadratus Imnbomm draws down the last rib, and acts as a muscle of forced exphation ; but, at the same time, by fixing the last rib it opposes the tendency of the Diaphragm to draw it upwards, and thus it becomes an assistant to inspiration. If the thorax and spine are fixed, it may act upon the pelvis, raising it towards its own side when only one muscle is put in action ; and when both muscles act together, either from below or above, they flex the trunk.

' Compressor urethraB. The Corrugator cutis ani.—Around the anus is a thin stratum of involuntary muscular fibre, which surrounds it in a radiating manner. Internally, the fibres fade off into the submucous tissue, whilst externally they blend with the true skin. By its contraction it raises the skin into ridges radiating from the margin of the anus. The External sphincter ani is a thin, flat plane of muscular fibres, elliptical in shape and intimately adherent to the integument surrounding the margin of the anus. It measures about three or four inches in length, from its anterior to its posterior extremity, being about an inch in breadth, opposite the anus. It arises from the tip of the coccyx, by a narrow tendinous band, and from the superficial fascia in front of that bone ; and is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perineum, joining with the Transversus perinsei, the Levator ani, and the Accelerator urinae. Like other sphincter muscles, it consists of two planes of muscular fibre, which surround the margin of the anus, and join in a commissure in front and behind. Nerve-supply.—A branch from the anterior division of the fourth sacral and the inferior haemorrhoidal branch of the internal pudic. Actions.—The action of this muscle is peculiar : i. It is, like other muscles, always in a state of tonic contraction, and having no antagonistic muscle it keeps the anal orifice closed. 2. It can be put into a condition of greater contraction under the influence of the will, so as to more firmly occlude the anal aperture. 3. Taking its fixed point at the coccyx, it helps to fix the central point of the perinaeum, so that the Accelerator may act from this fixed point. The Internal sphincter is a muscular ring which surrounds the lower extremity of the rectum for about an inch ; its inferior border being contiguous to, but quite separate from, the External sphincter. This muscle is about two lines in thickness, and is formed by an aggregation of the involuntary circular fibres of the intestine. It is paler in colour and less coarse in texture than the External sphincter. Actions.—Its action is entirely involuntary. It helps the External sphincter to occlude the anal aperture. The Levator ani (fig. 296) is a broad, thin muscle, situated on each side of the pelvis. It is attached to the inner surface of the sides of the true pelvis, and descending unites with its fellow of the opposite side to form the floor of the pelvic cavity. It supports the viscera in this cavity and surrounds the various structures which pass through it. It arises, in front, from the posterior surface of the body and ramus of the os pubis on the outer side of the symphysis ; posteriorly, from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium ; and between these two points, from the angle of division between the obturator and recto-vesical layers of the pelvic fascia at their under part. The fibres pass downwards to the middle fine of the floor of the pelvis, and are inserted, the most posterior into the sides of the apex of the coccyx ; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous raphe, which extends between the coccyx and the margin437 OF THE PELVIC OUTLET of the anus. The middle fibres, which form the larger portion of the muscle, are inserted into the side of the rectum, blending with the fibres of the Sphincter muscles; lastly, the anterior fibres, the longest, descend upon the side of the prostate gland to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, blending with the fibres of the External sphincter and Transversus perinpei muscles at the central tendinous point of the perinaeum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by connective tissue. From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with the prostate gland, descending by its side, and surrounding it as in a sling, it has been described by Santorini and others as a distinct muscle, under the name of Levator prostata. In the female, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani descend upon the side of the vagina. Relations.—-By its inner or ]jelvic surface, with the recto-vesical fascia, which separates it from the viscera of the pelvis and from the peritoneum. By its outer Fig. 296.—Side view of pelvis, showing Levator ani. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) or perineal surface, it forms the inner boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa, and is covered by a thin layer of fascia, the ischio-rectal or anal fascia, given off from the obturator fascia. Its posterior border is continuous with the Coccygeus muscle. Its anterior border is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a triangular space, through which the urethra, and in the female the vagina, passes from the pelvis. Nerve-supply.—A branch from the anterior division of the fourth sacral nerve. Actions.—This muscle su]3ports the lower end of the rectum and vagina, and also the bladder during the efforts of expulsion. It elevates and inverts the lower end of the rectum after it has been protruded and everted during the expulsion of the faces. It is also a muscle of forced expiration. The Coccygeus is situated behind and parallel with the preceding. It is a triangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, arising, by its apex, from the spine of the ischium and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and inserted, by its base, into the margin of the coccyx and into the side of the lower piece of the sacrum. This muscle is continuous with the posterior border of the Levator ani, and closes in the back part of the outlet of the pelvis.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 438 Relations.—Bj its iiuicr or j^elvic s2Lrface, ^Yith the rectum. By . its external surface, with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. By its iK)sterior border, with the Pyriformis. Nerve-supply.—A branch from the fom-th and fifth sacral nerves. Action.—The Coccygei muscles raise and support the coccyx, after it has been pressed backwards during def^ecation or parturition. Superficial fascia.—The superficial fascia of the perinaeum consists of two layers, superficial and deep, as in other regions of the body. The suioerficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains much adipose tissue in its meshes, the amount of which varies in different subjects. In front, it is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum ; behind, it is continuous with the subcutaneous areolar tissue surrounding the anus ; and, on either side, with the same fascia on the inner side of the thighs. This layer should be carefully removed after it has been examined, when the deep layer will be exposed. Fig. 297.—The perinseum. The integument and superficial layer of suxDerficial fascia reflected. The deep layer of sujjerficial fascia (Fascia of Colles) is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength, serving to bind down the muscles of the root of the penis. It is continuous, in front, with the dartos of the scrotum ; on either side it is firmly attached to the margins of the rami of the os pubis and ischium, external to the crus penis, and as far back as the tuberosity of the ischium; posteriorly, it curves down behind the Transversus perin^ei muscles to join the lower margin of the deep perineal fascia. This fascia not only covers the muscles in this region, but sends down a vertical septum from its under surface, which separates the back part of the subjacent space into two, being incomplete in front. The central tendinous point of the Perinseum.—This is a fibrous point in the middle line of the perinaeum, between the urethra and the rectum, being about half an inch in front of the anus. At this point four muscles converge and are attached: viz. the External sphincter ani, the Accelerator urinae, and the twoOF THE PERINEUM 439 Transyersu« periufei; so that by the contraction of these muscles, which extend in opposite du-ections, it serves as a fixed point of support The Transversus perinsei is a narrow nniscalar shp, which passes more or less ransversely across the back part of the perineal space.

It consists of two symmetrical halves, united along the median line by a tendinous raphe. It440 MUSCLES AND FASCIA arises from the central tendon of the perinsemn, and from the median raphe in front. From this point its fibres diverge like the plumes of a pen ; the most posterior form a thin layer, which are lost on the anterior surface of the triangular ligament; the middle fibres encircle the bulb and adjacent parts of the corpus spongiosum, and join with the fibres of the opposite side, on the upper part of the corpus spongiosum, in a strong aponeurosis ; the anterior fibres, the longest and most distinct, spread out over the sides of the corpus cavernosum, to be inserted partly into that body, anterior to the Erector penis, occasionally extending to the OS pubis ; partly terminating in a tendinous expansion, which covers the dorsal vessels of the penis. The latter fibres are best seen by dividing the muscle longitudinally, and dissecting it outwards from the surface of the urethra. Action.—This muscle serves to empty the canal of the urethra, after the bladder has expelled its contents ; during the greater part of the act of micturition its fibres are relaxed, and it only comes into action at the end of the process. The Fig. 299.—The superficial muscles and vessels of the perinsenm. middle fibres are supposed, by Krause, to assist in the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compressing the erectile tissue of the bulb. The anterior fibres, according to Tyrrel, also contribute to the erection of the penis, as they are inserted into, and continuous with, the fascia of the penis, compressing the dorsal vein during the contraction of the muscle. The Erector penis covers the unattached part of the crus penis. It is an elongated muscle, broader in the middle than at either extremity, and situated on either side of the lateral boundary of the perinseum. It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, behind the crus penis, from the surface of the crus, and from the adjacent portion of the ramus of the ischium. From these points fleshy fibres succeed, which end in an aponeurosis which is inserted into the sides and under surface of the crus penis. Nerve-supply.—The perineal branch of the internal pudic. Actions.—It compresses the crus penis and retards the return of the blood through the veins, and thus serves to maintain the organ erect.OF THE PERIN/EUM 441 Between the muscles just examined a triangular space exists, bounded internally by the Accelerator urinas, externally by the Erector penis, and behind by the Transversus perinaei. The floor of this space is formed by the triangular ligament of the urethra (deep perineal fascia), and running from behind forwards in it are the superficial perineal vessels and nerve, and. the transverse perineal artery coursing along the posterior boundary of the space on the Transversus perinaei muscle. The Triangular Ligament {Deep perineal fascia) is a dense membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and on each side to the rami of the ischium and pubes, beneath the crura penis. Its inferior margin, or base, is directed towards the rectum, and connected to the central tendinous point of the perinaeum. It is continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia behind the Transversus perinaei muscle, and with a thin fascia which covers the cutaneous surface of the Levator ani muscle (anal or ischio-rectal fascia). Fig. 300.—Triangular ligament or deep perineal fascia. On the left side the superficial layer has been removed. The triangular ligament is perforated by the urethra, about an inch below the symphysis pubis. The aperture is circular in form, and about three or four lines in diameter. Above this is the aperture for the dorsal vein of the penis; and, outside the latter, branches of the pudic nerve and artery pierce it. The triangular ligament consists of two layers, superficial or inferior, and deep or superior ; these are separated in front, but united behind. The superficial layer is continued forwards, around the anterior part of the membranous portion of the urethra, becoming lost upon the bulb. It is pierced by the duct of Cowper's gland. The deep layer is derived from the obturator fascia; * it is continued backwards around the posterior part of the membranous portion of the urethra and the outer surface of the prostate gland. * ' On the Anatomy of the Posterior Layer of the Triangular Ligament,' see a paper by Mr. Carrington, Guy's Hospital Beports. CompTessor urethrm Internal pudic artery Artery of the bulb C'owpe?''s gland Anterior layer of deep pe?'i7ieal fascia removed, showing,MUSCLES AND FASCIA 442 Structures between the two layers of the Triangular Ligament.—If the superficial layer of this fascia is detached on either side, the following structures Avill be seen between it and the deep layer : the subpubic ligament above, close to the pubes ; the dorsal vein of the penis ; the membranous portion of the urethra, and the Compressor m^ethr^e muscle ; Cowper's glands and their ducts ; the pudic vessels and nerve; the artery and nerve of the bulb, and a plexus of veins. The Compressor urethrae (Constrictor urethras) surrounds the whole length of the membranous portion of the urethra, and is contained between the two layers of the triangular ligament. It arises, by aponeurotic fibres, from the upper part of the ramus of the os pubis on each side, to the extent of half or three-quarters of an inch : each segment of the muscle passes inwards, and divides into two fasciculi, which surround the urethra from the prostate gland behind, to the bulbous portion of the urethra in front ; and unite, at the upper and lower surfaces of this tube, with the muscle of the opposite side, by means of a tendinous raphe. Actions.—The muscles of both sides act together as a sphincter, compressing the membranous portion of the urethra. During the transmission of fluids they, like the Acceleratores urinas, are relaxed, and only come into action at the end of the process to eject the last of the fluid. Muscles of the Pekin^um in the Female The Transversus perinsei in the female is a narrow muscular slip, which passes more or less transversely across the back part of the perineal space. It arises by a small tendon from the inner and fore part of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, passing inwards, is inserted into the central line of the perin^eum, joining in this situation with the muscle of the opposite side, the External sphincter ani behind, and the Sphincter vaginae in front. Nerve-supply.—The perineal branch of the internal pudic. Actions.—By their contraction they serve to fix the central tendinous point of the perinasum. The Sphincter vaginse surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinae in the male. It is attached posteriorly to the central tendinous point of the perineeum, where it blends with the External sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris, a fasciculus crossing over the body of the organ so as to compress the dorsal vein. Nerve-supply.—The perineal branch of the internal pudic. Actions.—It diminishes the orifice of the vagina. The anterior fibres contribute to the erection of the clitoris, as they are inserted into and are continuous with the fascia of the clitoris; compressing the dorsal vein during the contraction of the muscle. The Erector clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. It covers the unattached part of the crus clitoridis. It is an elongated muscle, broader at the middle than at either extremity, and situated on either side of the lateral boundary of the peringeum. It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, behind the crus clitoridis from the surface of the crus, and from the adjacent portion of the ramus of the ischium. From these points fleshy fibres succeed, which end in an aponeurosis, which is inserted into the sides and under surface of the crus clitoridis. Nerve-supply.—The perineal branch of the internal pudic. Actions.—It compresses the crus clitoridis and retards the return of blood through the veins, and thus serves to maintain the organ erect. The triangular ligament (deej) imineal fascia) in the female is not so strong as in the male. It is attached to the pubic arch, its apex being connected with the symphysis pubis. It is divided in the middle line by the aperture of the vagina, with the external coat of which it becomes blended, and in front of this is perforated443 OF THE UPPEE EXTREMITY by the urethra. Its posterior border is continuous, as in the male, with the deep layer of the superficial fascia around the Transversus perin£ei muscle. Structures between the two layers of the Triangular Ligament.—The subpubic ligament above, the dorsal vein of the clitoris, the membranous portion of the urethra and the Compressor urethrse muscle, the glands of Bartholin and their ducts ; the pudic vessels and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris ; the artery of the bulbi vestibuli, and a plexus of veins. The Compressor VLiethiSB {Constrictor wre^/ira) arises on each side from the margin of the descending ram^us of the os pubis. The fibres, passing inwards, divide into two sets : those of the fore part of the muscle are directed across the subpubic arch in front of the urethra to blend with the muscular fibres of the opposite side ; while those of the hinder and larger part pass inwards to blend with the wall of the vagina behind the urethra.

Dissection of Pectoral Begion and Axilla (fig. 301).—The arm being drawn away from the side nearly at right angles with the trunk, and rotated outwards, make a vertical incision through the integument in the median line of the chest, from the upper to theMUSCLES AND FASCIA 444 lower part of the sternmii; a second incision along the lower horder of the Pectoral muscle, from the ensiform cartilage to the inner side of the axilla; a third, from the sternum along the clavicle, as far as its centre; and a fourth, from the middle of the clavicle obliquely downwards, along the interspace between the Pectoral and Deltoid nniscles, as low as the fold of the armpit. The flap of integument is then to be dissected off in the direction indicated in the figure, but not entirely removed, as it should be replaced on completing the dissection. If a transverse incision is now made from the lower end of the sternum to the side of the chest, as far as the posterior fold of the armpit, and the integument reflected outwards, the axillary space will be more completely exposed. Fascia of the Thokax The superficial fascia of the thoracic region is a loose cellnlo-fibrous layer, enclosing masses of fat in its spaces. It is continuous with the superficial fascia of the neck and upper extremity above, and of the abdomen below. Opposite the mamma, it divides into two layers, one of which passes in front, the other behind that giand ; and from both of these layers numerous septa pass into its sub- stance, supporting its various lobes : from the anterior layer, fibrous pro- cesses pass forward to the integu- ment and nipple. These processes were called by Sir A. Cooper the ligamenta suspensoria, from the support they afford to the gland in this situation. The deep fascia of the thoracic region is a thin aponeurotic lamina, covering the surface of the great Pectoral muscle, and sending numerous prolongations between its fasciculi: it is attached, in the middle line, to the front of the sternum; and, above, to the clavicle. It is very thin over the upper part of the muscle, thicker in the interval between the Pectoralis major and Latissimus dorsi, where it closes in the axillary space, and divides at the outer margin of the latter muscle into two layers, one of which passes in front, and the other behind it; these proceed as far as the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae, to which they are attached. At the lower part of the thoracic region this fascia is well- developed, and is continuous with the fibrous sheath of the Recti muscles. Anterior Thoracic Region Pectoralis major. Pectoralis minor. Subclavius. The Pectoralis major (fig. 302) is a broad, thick, triangular muscle, situated at the upper and fore part of the chest, in front of the axilla. It arises from the anterior surface of the sternal half of the clavicle ; from half the breadth of the anterior surface of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage of the sixth or seventh rib; this portion of its origin consists of aponeurotic fibres, which intersect with those of the opposite muscle; it also arises from the Fig. 301.—Dissection of upper extremity.ANTERIOB THORACIC REGION 445 cartilages of all the true ribs, with the exception, frequently, of the first, or of he seventh or both ; and from the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle of the abdomeir The fibres from this extensive origin converge towards its insertion, giving to the muscle a radiated appearance. Those fibres which arise rom the davicle pass obliquely outwards and downwards, and are usually separated from the rest by a cellular interval: those from the lower part of the sternum and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, pass upwards and outwards; whils he middle fibres pass horizontally. They all terminate in a flat tendon, about two inches broad which is inserted into the anterior bicipital ndge of the humerus. This Fig. -Muscles of the chest and front of the arm. Superficial view. tendon consists of two lamina, placed one in front of the other and usually blended together below. The anterior, the thicker, receives the clavicular and upper half of the sternal portion of the muscle ; and its fibres are inserted m the same order as that in which they arise ; that is to say, the outermost fibres ot origin from the clavicle are inserted at the uppermost part of the tendon; tlie upper fibres of origin from the sternum pass down to the lowermost part ot this anterior lamina of the tendon and extend as low as the tendon of the Deltoid and join with it. The posterior lamina of the tendon receives the attachment ot theMUSCLES AND FASCIA 446 lower half of the sternal portion and the deeper part of the muscle from the costal cartilages. These deep fibres, and particularly those from the lower costal carti- lages, ascend the higher, turning backwards successively behind the superficial and upper ones, so that the tendon appears to be twisted. The posterior lamina reaches higher on the humerus than the anterior one, and from it an expansion is given off which covers the bicipital groove and blends with the capsule of the shoulder-joint. Another expansion passes downwards to the fascia of the arm. Relations.—By its anterior surface, w^ith the integument, the superficial fascia, the Platysma, the mammary gland, and the deep fascia. By its posterior surface : its thoracic portion, with the sternum, the ribs and costal cartilages, the costo- coracoid membrane, the Subclavius, Pectoralis minor, Serratus magnus, and the Intercostals ; its axillary portion forms the anterior wall of the axillary space, and covers the axillary vessels and nerves, the Biceps and Coraco-brachialis muscles. Its upper border lies parallel with the Deltoid, from which it is separated by a slight interspace in which lie the cephalic vein and descending branch of the acromial thoracic artery. Its loiuer border forms the anterior margin of the axilla, being at first separated from the Latissimus dorsi by a considerable interval; but both muscles gradually converge toAvards the outer part of the space. Dissection.—Detach the Pectoralis major by dividing the muscle along its attachment to the clavicle, and by making a vertical incision through its substance a little external to its line of attachment to the sternum and costal cartilages. The muscle should then be reflected outwards, and its tendon carefully examined. The Pectoralis minor is now exposed, and immediately above it, in the interval between its upper border and the clavicle, a strong fascia, the costo-coracoid memhnnie. The costo-coracoid membrane is a strong fascia placed between the clavicle and the upper border of the Pectoralis minor muscle, which protects the axillary vessels and nerves. Above, it is attached to the anterior margin of the Subclavian groove on the under surface of the clavicle, and is connected with a layer of cervical fascia which overlies the Omo-hyoid muscle, and forms the posterior layer of the sheath of the Subclavius muscle. Internally, it is attached to the first rib internal to the origin of the Subclavius muscle. Externally, it is very thick and dense, and is attached to the coracoid process. The portion extending from its attachment to the first rib to the coracoid process is often whiter and denser than the rest; this is sometimes called the costo-coracoid ligament. Below, it is thin, and at the upper border of the Pectoralis minor it splits into two layers to invest the muscle ; from the lower border of the Pectoralis minor it is continued down- wards to join the axillary fascia, and outwards to join the fascia over the short head of the Biceps. The costo-coracoid membrane is pierced by the cephalic vein, the acromial thoracic artery and vein, superior thoracic artery, and anterior thoracic nerves. The Pectoralis minor (fig. 303) is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, situated at the upper part of the thorax, beneath the Pectoralis major. It arises by thi^ee tendinous digitations, from the upper margin and outer surface of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, near their cartilages, and from the aponeurosis covering the Intercostal muscles ; the fibres jjass upwards and outwards, and converge to form a flat tendon, which is inserted into the inner border and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula. Relations.—By its anterior surface, \N\i\i the Pectoralis major, and the superior thoracic vessels and nerves. By its posterior surface, with the ribs, Intercostal muscles, Serratus magnus, the axillary space, and the axillary vessels and nerves. Its upper border is separated from the clavicle by a triangular interval, broad internally, narrow externally, bounded in front by the costo-coracoid membrane, and internally by the ribs. In this space are the first part of the axillary vessels and nerves. The costo-coracoid membrane should now be removed, when the Subclavius muscle will be seen. The Subclavius is a long, thin, spindle-shaped muscle, placed in the interval447 ANTEEIOE THORACIC REGION between the clavicle and the first rib. It arises by a short, thick tendon from the first rib and its cartilage at their junction, in front of the rhomboid ligament; the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely upwards and outwards, to be inserted into a deep groove on the under surface of the middle third of the clavicle. Relations.—By its upper surface, with the clavicle. By its under surface, it is separated from the first rib by the subclavian vessels and brachial plexus of nerves. Its anterior surface is separated from the Pectoralis major by the costo-coracoid membrane, which, with the clavicle, forms an osseo-fibrous sheath in which the muscle is enclosed. If the costal attachment of the Pectoralis minor is divided across, and the muscle reflected outwards, the axillary vessels and nerves are brought fully into view, and should be examined. Fig. 303.—Muscles of the chest and front of the arm, with the boundaries of the axilla. Nerves.—The Pectoral muscles are supplied by the anterior thoracic nerves ; the Subclavius, by a filament from the cord formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Actions.—If the arm has been raised by the Deltoid, the Pectoralis major will, conjointly with the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major, depress it to the side of the chest. If acting alone, it adducts and draws forwards the arm, bringing it across the front of the chest, and at the same time rotates it inwards. The Pectorahs minor depresses the point of the slioulder, drawing the scapula downwards and inwards to the thorax, and throwing the inferior angle backwards. The Subclavius depresses the shoulder, drawing the clavicle downwards and forwards. WhenMUSCLES AND FASCIiE 448 the arms are fixed, all three muscles act uiDon the ribs, drawing them upwards and expanding the chest, and thus becoming very important agents in forced inspiration. Asthmatic patients always assume an attitude which fixes the shoulders, so that all these muscles may be brought into action to assist in dilating the cavity of the chest. Fig. 304.—Serratus magmis. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England.) SLIP OFSETRR.MAG.TO iSrRig Spine ofScapuZz. Lateral Thoracic Region Serratus magnus. The Serratus magnus (fig. 304) is a broad, thin, and irregularly quadrilateral muscle, situated at the upper part and side of the chest. It consists of two triangular or fan-shaped portions ; the upper one having the apex of the triangle at- tached to the first and second ribs, and the base to the upper angle and vertebral border of the scapula ; the lower with its apex behind attached to the inferior angle of the scapula, and its base in front connected with the ribs from the second to the eighth. It arises by nine fleshy digitations from the outer surface and upper border of the eight upper ribs (the second rib having two), and from the aponeurosis covering the upper intercostal muscles, and is inserted into the whole length of the anterior aspect of the posterior border of the scapula. The upper fan-shaped portion is attached to the fore part of the outer surfaces of the first and second ribs ; its fibres spread out, the upper ones forming a thick fasciculus, which passes upwards and backwards, and is attached to the triangular smooth surface on the an- terior aspect of the superior angle of the scapula ; the remaining fibres proceed back- wards and downwards to be attached to the posterior border of the scapula between the superior and inferior angles. The lower fan-shaped portion is attached posteriorly by its apex to the anterior surface of the inferior angle of the scapula, partly by muscular, partly by tendinous fibres ; it spreads out like a fan, the upper fibres pass- ing forwards and upwards, the lower hori- zontally forwards to be inserted into the outer surface of the fore part of the ribs from the second to the eighth, by a series of muscular digitations. In the intervals between the four lower of these are received corresponding processes of the External oblique. Relations.—TMs muscle is covered, in front, by the Pectoral muscles ; behind, by the Subscapularis ; above, by the axillary vessels and nerves. Its deep surface rests upon the ribs and Intercostal muscles. Nerves.—The Serratus magnus is supplied by the posterior thoracic nerve. Actions.—The Serratus magnus, as a whole, carries the scapula forwards, and at the same time raises the vertebral border of the bone. It is therefore concerned in the action of pushing. Its lower and stronger fibres move forwards the lower angle and assist the Trapezius in rotating the bone round an axis through its centre,ACROMIAL REGION 449 and thus assists this muscle in raising the acromion and supporting weights upon the shoulder. It is possible that when the shoulders are fixed the lower fibres may assist in raising and everting the ribs ; but it is not the important inspiratory muscle which it was formerly believed to be. Surgical Anatomy.—When the muscle is paralysed, the vertebral border, and especially the lower angle, leave the ribs and stand out prominently on the surface, giving a peculiar ' winged' appearance to the back. The patient is unable to raise the arm above a right angle, and an attempt to do so is followed by a revolution of the scapula, instead of by the elevation of the arm. Dissection.—After completing the dissection of the axilla, if the muscles of the back have been dissected, the upper extremity should be separated from the trunk. Saw through the clavicle at its centre, and then cut through the muscles which connect the scapula and arm with the trunk, viz. the Pectoralis minor in front, Serratus magnus at the side, and the Levator anguli scapulae, the Rhomboids, Trapezius, and Latissimus dorsi behind. These muscles should be cleaned and traced to their respective insertions. Then make an incision through the integument, commencing at the outer third of the clavicle, and extending along the margin of that bone, the acromion process, and spine of the scapula; the integument should be dissected from above downwards and outwards, when the fascia covering the Deltoid is exposed (fig. 301, No. 3). The superficial fascia of the upper extremity is a thin cellulo-fibrous layer, containing the superficial veins and lymphatics, and the cutaneous nerves. It is most distinct in front of the elbow, and contains very large superficial veins and nerves ; in the hand it is hardly demonstrable, the integument being closely adherent to the deep fascia by dense fibrous bands. Small subcutaneous bursse are found in this fascia over the acromion, the olecranon, and the knuckles. The deep fascia of the upper extremity comprises the aponeurosis of the shoulder, arm, and forearm, the anterior and posterior annular ligaments of the carpus, and the palmar fascia. These will be considered in the description of the muscles of the several regions. Acromial Region Deltoid. The deep fascia covering the Deltoid (deltoid aponeurosis) is a fibrous layer, which covers the outer surface of the muscle, thick and strong behind, where it is continuous with the infraspinatus fascia, thinner over the rest of its extent. It sends down numerous prolongations between the fasciculi of the muscle. In front, it is continuous with the fascia covering the great Pectoral muscle ; behind, with that covering the Infraspinatus; above, it is attached to the clavicle, the acromion, and spine of the scapula ; below, it is continuous with the deep fascia of the arm. The Deltoid (fig. 302) is a large, thick, triangular muscle, which gives the rounded outline to the shoulder, and has received its name from its resemblance to the Greek letter A reversed. It surrounds the shoulder-joint in the greater part of its extent, covering it on its outer side, and in front and behind. It arises from the outer third of the anterior border and upper surface of the clavicle ; from the outer margin and upper surface of the acromion process ; and from the lower lip of the posterior border of the spine of the scapula, as far back as the triangular surface at its inner end. From this extensive origin the fibres converge towards their insertion, the middle passing vertically, the anterior obliquely backwards, the posterior obliquely forwards; they unite to form a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough prominence on the middle of the outer side of the shaft of the humerus. At its insertion the muscle gives off an expansion to the deep fascia of the arm. This muscle is remarkably coarse in texture, and the arrangement of its muscular fibres is somewhat peculiar ; the central portion of the muscle—that is to say, the part arising from the acromion process—consists of oblique fibres, which arise in a bipenniform manner from the sides of tendinous intersections, generally four in number, which are attached above to the acromion process and pass downwards parallel to one another in the substance of the muscle. The oblique muscular fibres thus formed are inserted into similar tendinous intersections, generally three in number, which pass upwards from the insertion of the muscle into the humerus G GMUSCLES AND FASCIA and alternate with the descending septa. The lateral portions of the muscle—that is to say, the fibres arising from the clavicle and spine of the scapula—are not arranged in this manner, but consist of parallel fasciculi passing from their origin above, to be inserted into the margins of the inferior tendon. Relations.—By its sujjerficial surface, with the integument, the superficial fascia, Platysma, and supra-acromial nerves. Its deeiJ surface is separated from the head of the humerus by a large sacculated synovial bursa, and covers the coracoid process, coraco-acromial ligament, Pectoralisminor, Coraco-brachialis, both heads of the Biceps, the tendon of the Pectoralis major, the insertions of the Supra- spinatus. Infraspinatus, and Teres minor, the scapular and external heads of the Triceps, the circumflex vessels and nerve, and the humerus. Its anterior border is separated at its upper part from the Pectoralis major by a cellular interspace, which lodges the cephalic vein and descending branch of the acromial thoracic artery : lower down the two muscles are in close contact, li^ posterior boi'-der rests on the Infraspinatus and Triceps muscles. Nerves.—The Deltoid is supplied by the circumflex nerve. Actions.—The Deltoid raises the arm directly from the side, so as to bring it at right angles with the trunk. Its anterior fibres, assisted by the Pectoralis major, draw the arm forwards ; and its posterior fibres, aided by the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi, draw it backwards. Surgical Anatomy.—The Deltoid is very liable to atrophy, and when in this condition simulates dislocation of the shoulder-joint, as there is flattening of the shoulder and apparent prominence of the acromion process; upon examination, however, it will be found that the relative position of the great tuberositj^ of the humerus to the acromion and coracoid process is unchanged. Atrophy of the Deltoid may be due to disuse or loss of trophic influence, either from injury to the circumflex nerve or cord lesions, as in infantile paralysis. Dissection.—Divide the Deltoid across, near its upper part, by an incision carried along the margin of the clavicle, the acromion process, and spine of the scapula, and reflect it downwards : the bursa will be seen on its under surface, as well as the circumflex vessels and nerve. Anteeioe Scapulak Eegion Subscapularis. The subscapular fascia is a thin membrane attached to the entire circumference of the subscapular fossa, and affording attachment by its inner surface to some of the fibres of the Subscapularis muscle : when this is removed, the Subscapularis muscle is exposed. The Subscapularis (fig. 303) is a large triangular muscle, which fills up the subscapular fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, with the exception of a narrow margin along the posterior border, and the surfaces at the superior and inferior angles which afford attachment to the Serratus magnus. Some fibres arise from tendinous laminte, which intersect the muscle, and are attached to ridges on the bone; and others from an aponeurosis, which separates the muscle from the Teres major and the long head of the Triceps. The fibres pass outwards, and, gradually converging, terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Those fibres which arise from the axillary border of the scapula are inserted into the neck of the humerus to the extent of an inch below the tuberosity. The tendon of the muscle is in close contact with the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and glides over a large bursa, which separates it from the base of the coracoid process. This bursa communicates with the cavity of the joint by an aperture in the capsular ligament. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Serratus magnus, Coraco- brachialis, and Biceps, the axillary vessels and nerves, and the subscapular vessels and nerves. By its ^posterior surface, with the scapula and the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Its loiuer border is contiguous with the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi.451 POSTERIOR SCAPULAR REGION Nerves.—It is supplied by the upper and lower subscapular nerves. Actions.—The Subscapularis rotates the head of the humerus inwards ; when the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. It is a powerful defence to the front of the shoulder-joint, preventing displacement of the head of the bone forwards. Posterior Scapulae Region (fig. 305) Supraspinatus. Teres minor. Infraspinatus. Teres major. Dissection.—T^o expose these muscles, and to examine their mode of insertion into the humerus, detach the Deltoid and Trapezius from their attachment to the spine of the scapula and acromion process. Remove the clavicle by dividing the ligaments connecting Fig. 305.—Muscles on the dorsum of the scapula and the Triceps. it with the coracoid process, and separate it at its articulation with the scapula: divide the acromion process near its root with a saw. The fragments being removed, the tendons of the posterior Scapular muscles will be fully exposed, and can be examined. A block should be placed beneath the shoulder-joint, so as to make the muscles tense. The supraspinous fascia is a thick and dense membranous layer, which com- pletes the osseo-fibrous case in which the Supraspinatus muscle is contained ; affording attachment, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of the muscle. It is thick internally, but thinner externally under the coraco-acromial ligament. When this fascia is removed, the Supraspinatus muscle is exposed. The Supraspinatus muscle occupies the whole of the supraspinous fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, and from the strong fascia which covers its sur- face. The muscular fibres converge to a tendon, which passes across the capsular G G 2452 MUSCLES AND FASCIA ligament of the shoulder-joint, to which it is intimately adherent, and is inserted into the highest of the three facets on the great tuberosity of the humerus. Relations.—By its tqyper surface, with the Trapezius, the clavicle, the acromion, the coraco-acromial ligament, and the Deltoid. By its tmde7' surface, with the scapula, the suprascapular vessels and nerve, and upper part of the shoulder-joint. The Infraspinous fascia is a dense fibrous membrane, covering in the Infra- spinatus muscle and attached to the circumference of the infraspinous fossa; it affords attachment, by its inner surface, to some fibres of that muscle. At the point where the Infraspinatus commences to be covered by the Deltoid, this fascia divides into two layers : one layer passes over the Deltoid muscle, helping to form the Deltoid fascia already described ; the other passes beneath the Deltoid to the shoulder-joint. The Infraspinatus is a thick, triangular muscle, which occupies the chief part of the infraspinous fossa, arising by fleshy fibres from its internal two-thirds ; and by tendinous fibres from the ridges on its surface : it also arises from a strong fascia which covers it externally, and separates it from the Teres major and minor. The fibres converge to a tendon, which glides over the external border of the spine of the scapula, and, passing across the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint, is inserted into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle is occasionally separated from the spine of the scapula by a synovial bursa, which communicates with the synovial cavity of the shoulder- joint. Relations.—By its ijosterior surface, with the Deltoid, the Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi, and the integument. By its anterior surface, with the scapula, from which it is separated by the suprascapular and dorsalis scapulae vessels, and with the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Its lower border is in contact with the Teres minor, and occasionally united with it, and with the Teres major. The Teres minor is a narrow, elongated muscle, which lies along the inferior border of the scapula. It arises from the dorsal surface of the axillary border of the scapula for the upper two-thirds of its extent, and from two aponeurotic laminge, one of which separates this muscle from the Infraspinatus, the other from the Teres major; its fibres pass obliquely upwards and outwards, and terminate in a tendon, which is inserted into the lowest of the three facets on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and, by fleshy fibres, into the humerus immediately below it. The tendon of this muscle passes across the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Relations.—By its posterior surface, with the Deltoid, and the integument. By its anterior surface, with the scapula, the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery, the long head of the Triceps, and the shoulder-joint. By its tipper border, with the Infraspinatus. By its loiver border, with the Teres major, from which it is separated anteriorly by the long head of the Triceps. The Teres major is a broad and somewhat flattened muscle, which arises from the dorsal aspect of the inferior angle of the scapula, and from the fibrous septa interposed between it and the Teres minor and Infraspinatus ; the fibres are directed upwards and outwards, and terminate in a flat tendon, about two inches in length, which is inserted into the posterior bicipital ridge of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle, at its insertion into the humerus, lies behind that of the Latissimus dorsi, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, the two tendons being, however, united along their lower borders for a short distance. Relations.—By its posterior surface, with the integument, from which it is separated, internally, by the Latissimus dorsi; and externally, by the long head of the Triceps. By its anterior surface, with the Subscapularis, Latissimus dorsi, Ooraco-brachialis, short head of the Biceps, the axillary vessels, and brachial plexus of nerves. Its upper border is at first in relation with the Teres minor, from which it is afterwards separated by the long head of the Triceps. Its loioer border forms, in conjunction with the Latissimus dorsi, part of the posterior boundary of the axilla.ANTERIOR HUMERAL REGION 453 Nerves.—The Supra- and Infraspinatus muscles are supplied by the supra- scapular nerve ; the Teres minor, by the circumflex ; and the Teres major, by the lower subscapular. Actions.—The Supraspinatus assists the Deltoid in raising the arm from the side, and fixes the head of the humerus in its socket. The Infraspinatus and Teres minor rotate the head of the humerus outwards: when the arm is raised, they assist in retaining it in that position and carrying it backwards. One of the most important uses of these three muscles is the great protection they afford to the shoulder-joint, the Supraspinatus supporting it above, and preventing displacement of the head of the humerus upwards, whilst the Infraspinatus and Teres minor protect it behind, and prevent dislocation backwards. The Teres major assists the Latissimus dorsi in drawing the humerus downwards and backwards, when previously raised, and rotating it inwards ; when the arm is fixed, it may assist the Pectoral and Latissimus dorsi muscles in drawing the trunk forwards. Anterior Humeral Region (fig. 303) Coraco-brachialis. Biceps. Brachialis anticus. Dissection.—The arm being placed on the table, with the front surface uppermost, make a vertical incision through the integument along the middle line, from the outer extremity of the anterior fold of the axilla, to about two inches below the elbow-joint, where it should be joined by a transverse incision, extending from the inner to the outer side of the forearm; the two flaps being reflected on either side, the fascia should be examined (fig. 301). The deep fascia of the arm is continuous with that covering the shoulder and front of the great Pectoral muscle, by means of which it is attached, above, to the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula ; it forms a thin, loose, membranous sheath investing the muscles of the arm, sending down septa between them, and composed of fibres disposed in a circular or spiral direction, and connected together by vertical and oblique fibres. It differs in thickness at difierent parts, being thin over the Biceps, but thicker where it covers the Triceps, and over the condyles of the humerus : it is strengthened by fibrous aponeuroses, derived from the Pectoralis major and Latissimus dorsi on the inner side, and from the Deltoid externally. On either side it gives off a strong intermuscular septum, which is attached to the condyloid ridge and condyle of the humerus. These septa serve to separate the muscles of the anterior from those of the posterior brachial region. The external intermuscular septum extends from the lower part of the anterior bicipital ridge, along the external condyloid ridge, to the outer condyle ; it is blended with the tendon of the Deltoid, gives attachment to the Triceps behind, to the Brachialis anticus, Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radiahs longior, in front; and is perforated by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The internal intermuscular septum, thicker than the preceding, extends from the lower part of the posterior lip of the bicipital groove below the Teres major, along the internal condyloid ridge to the inner condyle ; it is blended with the tendon of the Coraco-brachialis, and affords attachment to the Triceps behind, and the Brachialis anticus in front. It is perforated by the ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries. At the elbow, the deep fascia is attached to all the prominent points round the joint, viz. the condyles of the humerus and the olecranon process of the ulna, and is continuous with the deep fascia of the forearm. Just below the middle of the arm, on its inner side, in front of the internal intermuscular septum, is an oval opening in the deep fascia, which transmits the basilic vein and some lymphatic vessels. On the removal of this fascia, the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the anterior humeral region are exposed. The Coraco-brachialis, the smallest of the three muscles in this region, is situated at the upper and inner part of the arm. It arises by fleshy fibres from the apex of the coracoid ^orocess, in common with the short head of the Biceps, and from the intermuscular septum between the two muscles; the fibres passMUSCLES AND FASCIA 454 downwards, backwards, and a little outwards, to be inserted by means of a flat tendon into a rough ridge at the middle of the inner surface and internal border of the shaft of the humerus between the origins of the Triceps and Brachialis anticus. It is perforated by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The inner border of the muscle forms a guide to the position of the brachial artery in tying the vessel in the upper part of its course. Relations.—^By its anterior surface, with the Pectoralis major above, and at its insertion with the brachial vessels and median nerve which cross it. By its posterior surface, with the tendons of the Subscapularis, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major, the inner head of the Triceps, the humerus, and the anterior circumflex vessels. By its inner border, with the brachial artery, and the median and musculo- cutaneous nerves. By its outer border, with the short head of the Biceps and Brachialis anticus. The Biceps [Biceps flexor cubiti) is a long fusiform muscle, occupying the whole of the anterior surface of the arm, and divided above into two portions or heads, from which circumstance it has received its name. The short head arises by a thick flattened tendon from the apex of the coracoid process, in common with the Coraco-brachialis. The long head arises from the supraglenoid tubercle on the upper margin of the glenoid cavity, by a long rounded tendon, which is continuous with the glenoid ligament. This tendon arches over the head of the humerus, being enclosed in a special sheath of the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint; it then passes through an opening in the capsular ligament at its attachment to the humerus, and descends in the bicipital groove, in which it is retained by a fibrous prolongation from the tendon of the Pectoralis major. The fibres from this tendon form a rounded belly, and, about the middle of the arm, join with the portion of the muscle derived from the short head. The belly of the muscle, narrow and somewhat flattened, terminates above the elbow in a flattened tendon, which is inserted into the back part of the tuberosity of the radius, a synovial bursa being interposed between the tendon and the front of the tuberosity. The tendon of the muscle is thin and broad ; as it approaches the radius it becomes narrow and twisted upon itself, so that its external border becomes anterior, and its posterior flat surface is applied to the back of the tuberosity : opposite the bend of the elbow the tendon gives ofi', from its inner side, a broad aponeurosis, the bicipital fascia (semilunar fascia), which passes obliquely downwards and inwards across the brachial artery, and is continuous with the deep fascia of the forearm (fig. 302). The inner border of this muscle forms a guide to the position of the vessel, in tying the brachial artery in the middle of the arm.* Relations.—Its anterior surface is overlapped above by the Pectoralis major and Deltoid ; in the rest of its extent it is covered by the superficial and deep fasciae and the integument. Its posterior surface rests on the shoulder-joint and humerus, from which it is separated by the Subscapularis, Teres major, Latissimus dorsi, Brachialis anticus, and the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Its inner border is in relation with the Coraco-brachialis, the brachial vessels, and median nerve ; its outer border, with the Deltoid and Supinator longus. The Brachialis anticus is a broad muscle, which covers the elbow-joint and the lower half of the front of the humerus. It is somewhat compressed from before backward, and is broader in the middle than at either extremity. It arises from the lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the shaft of the humerus ; and commences above at the insertion of the Deltoid, which it embraces by two angular processes. Its origin extends below, to within an inch of the margin of * A third head to the Biceps is occasionally found (Theile says as often as once in eight or nine subjects), arising at the upper and inner part of the Brachialis anticus, with the fibres of which it is continuous, and inserted into the bicipital fascia and inner side of the tendon of the Biceps. In most cases this additional slip passes behind the brachial artery in its course down the arm. Occasionally the third head consists of two slips, which pass down, one in front, the other behind the artery, conceahng the vessel in the lower half of the arm.455 POSTERIOR HUMERAL REGION the articular surface, and is limited on each side by the external and internal borders of the shaft of the humerus. It also arises from the intermuscular septa on each side, but more extensively from the inner than the outer, from which it is separated below by the Supinator longus and Extensor carpi radialis longior. Its fibres converge to a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough depression on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna, being received into an interval between two fleshy slips of the Flexor digitorum profundus. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Biceps, the brachial vessels, musculo-cutaneous, and median nerves. By its posterior surface, with the humerus and front of the elbow-joint. By its inner border, with the Triceps, ulnar nerve, and Pronator radii teres, from which it is separated by the intermuscular septum. By its outer horder, with the musculo-spiral nerve, radial recurrent artery, the Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radialis longior. Nerves.—^The muscles of this group are supplied by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Brachialis anticus usually receives an additional filament from the musculo-spiral. Actions.—The Coraco-brachialis draws the humerus forwards and inwards, and at the same time assists in elevating it towards the scapula. The Biceps is a flexor of the forearm : it is also a supinator, and serves to render tense the deep fascia of the forearm by means of the broad aponeurosis given off from its tendon. The Brachialis anticus is a flexor of the forearm, and forms an important defence to the elbow-joint. When the forearm is fixed, the Biceps and Brachialis anticus flex the arm upon the forearm, as is seen in efforts of climbing, POSTEEIOR HUMEKAL ReGION Triceps. Subanconeus. The Triceps {Triceps extensor cuhiti) (fig. 305) is situated on the back of the arm, extending the entire length of the posterior surface of the humerus. It is of large size, and divided above into three parts ; hence its name. These three portions have been named (i) the middle, scapular, or long head ; (2) the external, or long humeral ; and (3) the internal, or short humeral head. The middle or scapular head arises, by a flattened tendon, from a rough triangular depression, immediately below the glenoid cavity, being blended at its upper part with the capsular ligament ; the muscular fibres pass downwards between the two other portions of the muscle, and join with them in the common tendon of insertion. The external head arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus, between the insertion of the Teres minor and the upper part of the musculo-spiral groove ; from the external border of the humerus and the external intermuscular septum : the fibres from this origin converge towards the common tendon of insertion. The internal head arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus, below the groove for the musculo-spiral nerve ; commencing above, narrow and pointed, below the insertion of the Teres major, and extending to within an inch of the trochlear surface : it also arises from the internal border of the humerus and internal intermuscular septum. The fibres of this portion of the muscle are directed, some downwards to the olecranon, whilst others converge to the common tendon of insertion. The common tendon of the Triceps commences about the middle of the back part of the muscle : it consists of two aponeurotic laminaB, one of which is subcutaneous and covers the posterior surface of the muscle for the lower half of its extent; the other is more deeply seated in the substance of the muscle : after receiving the attachment of the muscular fibres, they join together above the elbow, and are inserted, for the most part, into the back part of the upper surface of the olecranon process ; a band of fibres is, however, continued downwards, on the outer side, over the Anconeus, to blend with the deep fascia of the forearm. A small bursa,456 MUSCLES AND FASCIA occasionally multilocular, is situated on the front part of this surface, beneath the tendon. The long head of the Triceps descends between the Teres minor and Teres major, dividing the triangular space between these two muscles and the humerus into two smaller spaces, one triangular, the other quadrangular (fig. 305). The triangular space contains the dorsal is scapulae vessels ; it is bounded by the Teres minor above, the Teres major below, and the scapular head of the Triceps externallv: the quadrangular space transmits the posterior circumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve ; it is bounded by the Teres minor above, the Teres major below, the scapular head of the Triceps internally, and the humerus exter- nally. Relations.—By its posterior surface, with the Deltoid above : in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous. By its anterior surface, with the humerus, musculo- spiral nerve, superior profunda vessels, and back part of the elbow-joint. Its middle or long liead is in relation, behind, with the Deltoid and Teres minor; in front, with the Subscapularis, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major. The Subanconeus is a name given to a few fibres from the lower part of the Triceps muscle, which are inserted into the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. By some authors it is regarded as the analogue of the Subcrureus in the lower limb, but it is not a separate muscle. Nerves.—The Triceps is supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve. Actions.—The Triceps is the great extensor muscle of the forearm, serving, when the forearm is flexed, to extend the elbow-joint. It is the direct antagonist of the Biceps and Brachialis anticus. When the arm is extended, the long head of the muscle may assist the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi in drawing the humerus backwards and in adducting it to the thorax. The long head of the Triceps protects the under part of the shoulder-joint, and prevents displacement of the head of the humerus downwards and backwards. The Subanconeus draws up the posterior ligament during extension of the forearm. Stirgical Anatomy.—The existence of the band of fibres from the Triceps to the fascia of the forearm is of importance in excision of the elbow and should always be carefully preserved from injury by the operator, as by means of these fibres the patient is enabled to extend the forearm, a movement which would otherwise mainly be accomplished by gravity, that is to say, allowing the forearm to drop from its own weight. Muscles of the Fokearm Dissection.—^To dissect the forearm, place the limb in the position indicated in fig. 301 ; make a vertical incision along the middle line from the elbow to the wrist, and a transverse incision at the extremity of this; the superficial structures being removed, the deep fascia of the forearm is exposed. The deep fascia of the forearm, continuous above with that enclosing the arm, is a dense, highly glistening aponeurotic investment, which forms a general sheath enclosing the muscles in this region ; it is attached, behind, to the olecranon and posterior border of the ulna, and gives off from its inner surface numerous inter- muscular septa, which enclose each muscle separately. Below, it is continuous in front with the anterior annular ligament, and forms a sheath for the tendon of the Palmaris longus muscle, which passes over the annular ligament to be inserted into the palmar fascia. Behind, near the wrist-joint, it becomes much thickened by the addition of many transverse fibres, and forms the posterior annular liga- ment. It consists of circular and oblique fibres, connected together by numerous vertical fibres. It is much thicker on the dorsal than on the palmar surface, and at the lower than at the upper part of the forearm, and is strengthened by tendinous fibres derived from the Brachialis anticus and Biceps in front, and from the Triceps behind. Its inner surface gives origin to muscular fibres, especially at the upper part of the inner and outer sides of the forearm, and forms the boundaries of a series of conical-shaped cavities, in which the muscles are contained. Besides the-vertical septa separating each muscle, transverse septa areANTERIOK BRACHIAL REGION 457 given off both on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the forearm, separating the deep from the superficial layer of muscles. Numerous apertures exist in the fascia for the passage of vessels and nerves ; one of these, of large size, situated at the front of the elbow, serves for the passage of a communicating branch between the superficial and deep veins. The muscles of the forearm may be subdivided into groups corresponding to the region they occupy. One group occupies the inner and anterior aspect of the forearm, and comprises the Flexor and Pronator muscles. Another group occupies its outer side ; and a third its posterior aspect. The two latter groups include all the Extensor and Supinator muscles. Anteeior Brachial Region Superficial Layer Pronator radii teres. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Flexor carpi radialis. Flexor sublimis digitorum. Palmaris longus. These muscles take origin from the internal condyle of the humerus by a common tendon. The Pronator radii teres arises by two heads. One, the larger and more superficial, arises from the humerus, immediately above the internal condyle, and from the tendon common to the origin of the other muscles ; also from the fascia of the forearm, and intermuscular septum between it and the Flexor carpi radialis. The other head is a thin fasciculus, which arises from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, joining the preceding at an acute angle. Between the two heads passes the median nerve. The muscle passes obliquely across the forearm from the inner to the outer side, and terminates in a fiat tendon, which turns over the outer margin of the radius, and is inserted into a rough impression at the middle of the outer surface of the shaft of that bone. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the deep fascia, the Supinator longus, and the radial vessels and nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Brachialis anticus, Flexor sublimis digitorum, the median nerve, and ulnar artery: the small, or deep, head being interposed between the two latter structures. Its outer border forms the inner boundary of a triangular space, in which is placed the brachial artery, median nerve, and tendon of the Biceps muscle. Its inner border is in contact with the Flexor carpi radialis. Surgical Anatomy.—This muscle, when suddenly brought into very active use, as in the game of lawn tennis, is apt to be strained, producing slight swelling, tenderness, and pain on putting the muscle into action. This is known as ' lawn-tennis arm.' The Flexor carpi radialis lies on the inner side of the preceding muscle. It arises from the internal condyle by the common tendon, from the fascia of the fore- arm, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the Pronator radii teres, on the outside ; the Palmaris longus, internally ; and the Flexor sublimis digitorum, beneath. Slender and aponeurotic in structure at its commencement, it increases in size, and terminates in a tendon, which forms the lower two-thirds of its length. This tendon passes through a canal on the outer side of the annular ligament, runs through a groove in the os trapezium (which is converted into a canal by a fibrous sheath, and lined by a synovial membrane), and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, and by a slip into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. The radial artery lies between the tendon of this muscle and the Supinator longus, and may easily be tied in this situation. Relations.—By its superficial surface, Avith the deep fascia and the integument. By its deep surface, with the Flexor sublimis digitorum, Flexor longus poUicis, and wrist-joint. By its outer border, with the Pronator radii teres and the radial vessels. By its inner border, with the Palmaris longus above, and the median nerve below. The Palmaris longus is a slender, fusiform muscle, lying on the inner side of458 MUSCLES AND FASCIA Fig. 306.—Front of the left forearm.. Superficial miTScles. the preceding. It arises from the inner condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from the deep fascia, and the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It terminates in a slender, flattened tendon, which passes over the annular hgament, to end in the palmar fascia, frequently sending a tendinous slip to the short muscles of the thumb. This muscle is often absent. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the deep fascia. By its deep surface, with the Flexor sublimis digitorum. Inter- nally, with the Flexor carpi ulnaris. Ex- ternally, with the Flexor carpi radialis. The median nerve lies close to the tendon, just above the wrist, on its inner and posterior side. The Flexor carpi ulnaris lies along the ulnar side of the forearm. It arises by two heads, connected by a tendinous arch, beneath which pass the ulnar nerve and posterior ulnar recurrent artery. One head arises from the inner condyle of the humerus by the common tendon ; the other, from the inner margin of the olecranon, by an aponeurosis from the upper two-thirds of the posterior border of the ulna, in common with the Extensor carpi ulnaris and the Flexor profundus digitorum ; and from the inter- muscular septum between it and the Flexor sublimis digitorum. The fibres terminate in a tendon, which occupies the anterior part of the lower half of the muscle, and is in- serted into the pisiform bone, and is pro- longed from this to the fifth metacarpal and unciform bones by the piso-metacarpal and piso-uncinate ligaments and to the annular ligament. The ulnar artery lies on the outer side of the tendon of this muscle, in the lower two-thirds of the forearm; the ten- don forming a guide in tying the vessel in this situation. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the deep fascia, with which it is inti- mately connected for a considerable extent. By its deep surface, with the Flexor sublimis digitorum, the Flexor profundus digitorum, the Pronator quadratus, and the ulnar vessels and nerve. By its outer or radial border, with the Palmaris longus above, and the ulnar vessels and nerve below. The Flexor sublimis digitorum {per- foratus) is placed beneath the preceding muscles, which therefore must be removed in order to bring its attachment into view. It is the largest of the muscles of the superficial layer, and arises by three heads. One head arises from the internal condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, from the internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, and from the intermuscular septum common to it and the preceding muscles. The second head arises from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, above the ulnar origin of the Pronator radii teres (fig. 200, p. 227). The third head arises from the oblique line of the radius, extending fromANTEEIOR BRACHIAL REGION 459 the tubercle to the insertion of the Pronator radii teres. The fibres pass vertically downwards, forming a broad and thick muscle, which divides into four tendons about the middle of the forearm ; as these tendons pass beneath the annular ligament into the palm of the hand, they are arranged in pairs, the anterior pair corresponding to the middle and ring fingers, the posterior pair to the index and little fingers. The tendons diverge from one another as they pass onwards. Opposite the base of the first phalanges each tendon divides into two slips, to allow of the passage of the corresponding tendons of the Flexor profundus digitorum ; the two portions of the tendon then unite and form a grooved channel for the reception of the accompanying deep flexor tendon. Finally they subdivide a second time, to be inserted into the sides of the second phalanges about their middle. After leaving the palm, these tendons accompanied by the deep flexor tendons lie in osseo-aponeurotic canals, formed by the fibrous sheath of the tendons and the bones (fig. 316). Relations.—In the forearm, by its superficial surface, with the deep fascia and all the preceding superficial muscles ; by its cleeio surface, with the Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis, the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the median nerve. In the hand, its tendons are in relation, in front, with the palmar fascia, superficial palmar arch, and the branches of the median nerve ; behind, with the tendons of the deep Flexor and the Lumbricales. Fibrous sheath of the Flexor tendons.—The flexor tendons of the fingers a they run along the phalanges are retained against the bones by a fibrous sheath, forming osseo-aponeurotic canals. These sheaths are formed b.y strong fibrous bands, which arch across the tendons, and are attached on each side to the margins of the phalanges. Opposite the middle of the proximal and second phalanges the sheath is very strong, and the fibres pass transversely ; but opposite the joints it is much thinner, and the fibres pass obliquely. Each sheath is lined by a synovial membrane, which is reflected on the contained tendon. Anterior Brachial Region Deep Layer Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis. Pronator quadratus. Dissection.—Divide each of the superficial muscles at its centre, and turn either end aside; the deep layer of muscles, together with the median nerve and u.lnar vessels, will then be exposed. The Flexor profundus digitorum (perforans) (fig. 307) is situated on the ulnar side of the forearm, immediately beneath the superficial Flexors. It arises from the upper three-fourths of the anterior and inner surfaces of the shaft of the ulna, embracing the insertion of the Brachialis anticus above, and extending, below, to within a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from a depression on the inner side of the coronoid process; by an aponeurosis from the upper three-fourths of the posterior border of the ulna, in common with the Flexor and Extensor carpi ulnaris ; and from the ulnar half of the interosseous membrane. The fibres form a fleshy belly of considerable size, which divides into four tendons : these pass under the annular ligament beneath the tendons of the Flexor sublimis digitorum. Opposite the first phalanges, the tendons pass between the two slips of the tendons of the Flexor sublimis digitorum, and are finally inserted into the bases of the last phalanges. The tendon of the index finger is distinct; the rest are connected together by cellular tissue and tendinous slips, as far as the palm of the hand. The tendons of this and those of the Flexor subhmis digitorum, whilst contained in the osseo-aponeurotic canals of the fingers, are invested in a synovial sheath, and are connected to each other, and to the phalanges, by slender, tendinous filaments, called vincula accessoria tenclinum. One of these connects the deep tendon to the bone, before it passes through the superficial tendon; a second connects460 MUSCLES AND FASCIA YiG, 307.—Front of the left forearm. Deep mnscles. the two tendons together, after the deep tendons have passed through ; and a thh^d con- nects the deep tendon to the head of the second phalanx. This last consists largely of yellow elastic tissue, and may assist in drawing down the tendon after flexion of the finger.* Four small muscles, the Lumbricales, are connected with the tendons of the Flexor profundus in the palm They mil be described with the muscles in that region. Relations.—By its sujjer- ficial surface, in the forearm, with the Flexor sublimis digi- torum, the Flexor carpi ulna- ris, the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the median nerve ; and in the hand, with the tendons of the superficial Flexor.

By its ulnar border, with the Flexor carpi ulnaris. By its radial border, with the Flexor longus pollicis, the anterior inter- osseous vessels and nerve being interposed. The Flexor longus pollicis is situated on the radial side of the forearm, lying on the same plane as the preceding. It arises from the grooved anterior surface of the shaft of the radius : commencing, above, immediately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and extending, below, to within a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and generally by a fleshy slip from the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards, and terminate in * Marshall, Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., 1853.EADIAL REGION 461 a flattened tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, is then lodged in the interspace between the outer head of the Flexor brevis pollicis and the Adductor obliquus pollicis, and, entering an osseo-aponeurotic canal similar to those for the other flexor tendons, is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb.

By its dee2) surface, with the radius, interosseous membrane, and Pronator quadratus. By its ulnar border, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve. The Pronator quadratus is a small, flat, quadrilateral muscle, extending trans- versely across the front of the radius and ulna, above their carpal extremities. It arises from the oblique or pronator ridge on the lower part of the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna ; from the lower fourth of the anterior surface, and the anterior border of the ulna ; and from a strong aponeurosis which covers the inner third of the muscle. The fibres pass horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the lower fourth of the anterior surface and anterior border of the shaft of the radius. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, the Flexor longus pollicis. Flexor carpi radialis, and the radial vessels. By its dee]) surface, with the radius, ulna, and interosseous membrane. Nerves.—All the muscles of the superficial layer are supplied by the median nerve, excepting the Flexor carpi ulnaris, which is supplied by the ulnar. Of the deep layer, the Flexor profundus digitorum is supplied conjointly by the ulnar and by the median, through its branch, the anterior interosseous nerve, which also supplies the Flexor longus pollicis and Pronator quadratus. Actions.—These muscles act upon the forearm, the wrist, and hand. The Pronator radii teres helps to rotate the radius upon the ulna, rendering the hand prone : when the radius is fixed, it assists the other muscles in flexing the forearm. The Flexor carpi radialis is one of the flexors of the wrist; when acting alone, it flexes the wrist, inclining it to the radial side. It can also assist in pronating the forearm and hand, and, by continuing its action, to bend the elbow. The Flexor carpi ulnaris is one of the flexors of the wrist: when acting alone, it flexes the Avrist, inclining it to the ulnar side ; and by continuing to contract, to bend the elbows The Palmaris longus is a tensor of the palmar fascia. It also assists in flexing the wrist and elbow. The Flexor sublimis digitorum flexes first the middle, and then the proximal phalanx. It assists in flexing the wrist and elbow. The Flexor profundus digitorum is one of the flexors of the phalanges. After the Flexor sublimis has bent the second phalanx, the Flexor profundus flexes the terminal one ; but it cannot do so until after the contraction of the superficial muscle. It also assists in flexing the wrist. The Flexor longus pollicis is a flexor of the phalanges of the thumb. When the thumb is fixed, it also assists in flexing the wrist. The Pronator quadratus helps to rotate the radius upon the ulna, rendering the hand prone. Radial Region (fig. 308) Supinator longus. Extensor carpi radialis longior. Extensor carpi radialis brevior. Dissection.—Divide the integument in the same manner as in the dissection of the anterior brachial region; and, after having examined the cutaneous vessels and nerves and deep fascia, remove all those structures. The muscles will then be exposed. The removal of the fascia will be considerably facilitated by detaching it from below up- wards. Great care should be taken to avoid cutting across the tendons of the muscles of the thumb, which cross obliquely the larger tendons running down the back of the radius. The Supinator longus is the most superficial muscle on the radial side of the forearm: it is fleshy for the upper two-thirds of its extent, tendinous below. It arises from the upper two-thirds of the external condyloid ridge of the humerus.MUSCLES AND FASCL^^ 462 Fig. 308.—Posterior surface of the forearm.

The fibres terminate above the middle of the forearm in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the outer side of the base of the styloid process of the radius.

By its inner border, above the elbow, with the Brachialis anticus, the musculo-spiral nerve, and radial recurrent artery; and in the fore- arm, with the radial vessels and nerve. The Extensor carpi radialis longior is placed partly beneath the preceding muscle. It arises from the lower third of the external condyloid ridge of the humerus, and from the external intermuscu- lar septum. The fibres terminate at the upper third of the forearm in a flat tendon, which runs along the outer border of the radius, be- neath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; it then passes through a groove common to it and the Ex- tensor carpi radialis brevior, imme- diately behind the styloid process, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, on its radial side.

By its deep surface, with the elbow- joint, the Extensor carpi radialis brevior, and back part of the wrist. The Extensor carpi radialis brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the pre- ceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus, by a tendonPOSTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION 463 common to it and the three following muscles; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface ; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. The fibres terminate about the middle of the forearm in a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the preceding muscle, and accompanies it to the wrist, lying in the same groove on the posterior surface of the radius; it passes beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb, then beneath the annular ligament, and, diverging some- what from its fellow, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, on its radial side. The tendons of the two preceding muscles pass through the same compartment of the annular ligament, and are lubricated by a single synovial membrane, but are separated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone as they lie in the groove at the back of the radius.

Posterior Brachial Region (fig. 308) Superficial Layer Extensor communis digitorum. Extensor carpi ulnaris. Extensor minimi digiti. Anconeus. The Extensor communis digitorum is situated at the back part of the forearm. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus, by the common tendon ; from the deep fascia, and the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. Just below the middle of the forearm it divides into three tendons, which pass, together with the Extensor indicis, through a separate compartment of the annular ligament, lubricated by a synovial membrane. The tendons then diverge, the innermost one dividing into two; and all, after passing across the back of the hand, are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers in the following manner: each tendon becomes narrow and thickened opposite the meta- carpo-phalangeal articulation, and gives off a thin fasciculus upon each side of the joint, which blends with the lateral ligaments and serves as the posterior ligament; after having passed the joint, it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole of the dorsal surface of the first phalanx; being reinforced, in this situation, by the tendons of the Interossei and Lumbricales. Opposite the first phalangeal joint this aponeurosis divides into three slips, a middle and two lateral: the former is inserted into the base of the second phalanx; and the two lateral, which are continued onwards along the sides of the second phalanx, unite by their contiguous margins, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the last phalanx. As the tendons cross the phalangeal joints, they furnish them with posterior ligaments. The tendons of the middle, ring, and little fingers are connected together, as they cross the hand, by small, oblique, tendinous slips, or vincula; those on each side of the ring-finger are strong, and bind the tendon of this finger closely to those of the middle and little finger, so that it cannot, in general, be freely extended without moving the other two. Sometimes there is also a thin slip between the tendons of the index and middle fingers. The tendons of the index and little fingers also receive, before their division, the special extensor tendons belonging to them. Relations.—By its siiperficial surface, with the fascia of the forearm and hand, the posterior annular ligament, and integument.

By its radial border, with the Extensor carpi radialis brevior. By its ulnar border, with the Extensor minimi digiti and Extensor carpi ulnaris.MUSCLES AND FASCIJ5 464 The Extensor minimi digiti is a slender muscle placed on the inner side of the Extensor communis, with which it is generally connected. It arises from the common tendon by a thin, tendinous slip ; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. Its tendon runs through a separate compartment in the annular ligament behind the inferior radio-ulnar joint, then divides into two as it crosses the hand, one slip being united to the common extensor by a cross-piece at the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. Both finally spread into a broad aponeurosis, which blends with the common extensor to the finger, and is inserted into the second and third phalanges. The tendon is situated on the ulnar side of, and somewhat more superficial than, the common extensor. The Extensor carpi ulnaris is the most superficial muscle on the ulnar side of the forearm. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus, by the common tendon ; from the middle third of the posterior surface of the ulna, below the Anconeus, and by an aponeurosis from the posterior border of the ulna in common with the Flexor carpi ulnaris and the Flexor profundus digitorum ; and from the deep fascia of the forearm. This muscle terminates in a tendon, which runs through a groove behind the styloid process of the ulna, passes through a separate compart- ment in the annular ligament, and is inserted into the prominent tubercle on the ulnar side of the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the deep fascia of the forearm. By its deep surface, with the ulna, and the muscles of the deep layer. The Anconeus is a small, triangular muscle, placed behind and below the elbow- joint, and appears to be a continuation of the external portion of the Triceps. It arises by a separate tendon from the back part of the outer condyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the side of the olecranon, and upper fourth of the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna; its fibres diverge from their origin, the upper ones being directed transversely, the lower obliquely inwards. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with a strong fascia derived from the Triceps. By its deep surface, with the elbow-joint, the orbicular ligament, the ulna, and a small portion of the Supinator brevis. PosTERioE Brachial Eegion (fig. 310) Deep Layer Supinator brevis. Extensor brevis pollicis. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Extensor longus pollicis. Extensor indicis. The Supinator brevis is a broad muscle, of a hollow cylindrical form, curved round the upper third of the radius. It consists of two distinct planes of muscular fibres, between which lies the posterior interosseous nerve. The two planes arise in common : the superficial one by tendinous, and the deeper by muscular fibres . from the external condyle of the humerus ; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, and the orbicular ligament of the radius; from the ridge on the ulna, which runs obliquely downwards from the posterior extremity of the lesser sigmoid cavity ; from the triangular depression in front of it ; and from a tendinous expansion which covers the surface of the muscle. The superficial fibres surround the upper part of the radius, and are inserted into the outer edge of the bicipital tuberosity and to the oblique line of the radius, as low down as the insertion of the Pronator radii teres. The upper fibres of the deeper plane form a sling-like fasciculus, which encircles the neck of the radius above the tuberosity and is attached to the back part of its inner surface : the greater part of this portion of the muscle is inserted into the posterior and external surface of the shaft, midway between the oblique line and the head of the bone. Between the insertion of the two planes, the posterior interosseous nerve lies on the shaft of the bone. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the superficial Extensor and465 POSTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION Supinator muscles, and the radial vessels and nerve. By its deep surface, with the elbow-joint, the interosseous membrane, and the radius. The Extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis is the most external and the largest of Fig. 309.—Supinator brevis.

'•a'iiaJis hrevior Extensor carpi radialis longior 1j ten or catin ulnaris the deep extensor muscles ; it lies immediately below the Supinator brevis, with which it is sometimes united. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna below the in- sertion of the Anconeus, from the interosseous membrane, and from the middle third of the posterior surface of the shaft of the radius. Passing obliquely downwards and outwards, it terminates in a tendon, which runs through a groove on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius, accompanied by the tendon of the Extensor brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. It occasionally gives off two slips, near its HHMUSCLES AND FASCIA 466 insertion: one to the Trapezium, and the other to blend with the origin of the Abductor poUicis. Relations.—By its siqjerficial surface, with the Extensor communis digitorum, Extensor minimi digiti, and fascia of the forearm; and with the branches of the posterior interosseous artery and nerve which cross it. By its cleejj surface, with the ulna, interosseous membrane, radius, the tendons of the Extensor carpi radiahs longior and brevior, which it crosses obliquely; and, at the outer side of the wrist, with the radial vessels. By its upper border, with the Supinator brevis. By its loiver border, with the Extensor brevis polhcis. The Extensor brevis poUicis {Extensor primi internodii pollicis), the smallest muscle of this group, lies on the inner side of the preceding. It arises from the pos- terior surface of the shaft of the radius, below the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and from the interosseous membrane. Its direction is similar to that of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, its tendon passing through the same groove on the outer side of the styloid process, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—The same as those of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. The Extensor longus pollicis {Extensor secundi internodii pollicis) is much larger than the preceding muscle, the origin of which it partly covers in. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, below the origin of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and from the interosseous membrane. It terminates in a tendon, which passes through a separate compartment in the annular ligament, lying in a narrow, oblique groove at the back part of the lower end of the radius. It then crosses obliquely the tendons of the Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, being separated from the other extensor tendons of the thumb by a triangular interval, in which the radial artery is found ; and is finally inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the same parts as the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. By its deep surface, with the ulna, interosseous membrane, the posterior interosseous nerve, radius, the wrist, the radial vessels, and metacarpal bone of the thumb. The Extensor indicis is a narrow, elongated muscle, placed on the inner side of, and parallel with, the preceding. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, below the origin of the Extensor longus pollicis and from the inter- osseous membrane. Its tendon passes with the Extensor communis digitorum through the same canal in the annular ligament, and subsequently joins the tendon of the Extensor communis which belongs to the index finger, opposite the lower end of the corresponding metacarpal bone, lying to the ulnar side of the tendon from the common Extensor. Relations.—^The relations are similar to those of the preceding muscles. Nerves.—The Supinator longus, Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Anconeus, are supplied by branches from the musculo-spiral nerve ; the remaining muscles of the radial and posterior brachial regions, by the posterior interosseous nerve. Actions.—The muscles of the radial and posterior brachial regions, which comprise all the extensor and supinator muscles, act upon the forearm, wrist, and hand; they are the direct antagonists of the pronator and flexor muscles. The Anconeus assists the Triceps in extending the forearm. The chief action of the Supinator longus is that of a flexor of the elbow-joint, but in addition to this it may act both as a supinator or a pronator : that is to say, if the forearm is forcibly pronated, it will act as a supinator, and bring the bones into a position midway between supination and pronation ; and, vice versa, if the arm is forcibly supinated, it will act as a jpronator, and bring the bones into the same position, midway between supination and pronation. The action of the muscle is therefore to throw the forearm and hand into the position they naturally occupy when placed across the chest. The Supinator brevis is a supinator ; that is to say, when the radius has been carried across the ulna in pronation, and the back of the hand is directed forwards, this muscle carries the radius back again to its normal position on theOF THE HAND 467 outer side of the ulna, and the pahii of the hand is again directed forwards. The Extensor carpi radiahs longior extends the wrist and abducts the hand. It may also assist in bending the elbow-joint; at all events it serves to fix or steady this articulation. The Extensor carpi radialis brevior assists the Extensor carpi radialis longior in extending the wrist, and may also act slightly as an abductor of the hand. The Extensor carpi ulnaris helps to extend the hand, but when acting alone inclines it towards the ulnar side: by its continued action it extends the elbow-joint. The Extensor communis digitorum extends the phalanges, then the wrist, and finally the elbow. It acts principally on the proximal phalanges, the middle and terminal phalanges being extended mainly by the Interossei and Lumbricales. It has also a tendency to separate the fingers as it extends them. The Extensor minimi digiti extends the little finger, and by its continued action it assists in extending the wrist. It is owing to this muscle that the little finger can be extended or pointed whilst the others are flexed. The chief action of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis is to carry the thumb outwards and backwards from the palm of the hand, and hence it has been called the abductor longus pollicis. By its continued action it helps to extend and abduct the wrist. The Extensor brevis pollicis extends the proximal phalanx of the thumb. By its continued action it helps to extend and abduct the wrist. The Extensor longus pollicis extends the terminal phalanx of the thumb. By its continued action it helps to extend and abduct the wrist. The Extensor indicis extends the index finger, and by its continued action assists in extending the wrist. It is owing to this muscle that the index finger can be extended or pointed while tlie others are flexed. Surgical Anatomy.—The tendons of the Extensor muscles of the thumb are liable to become strained, and their sheaths inflamed, after excessive exercise, producing a sausage- shaped swelling along the course of the tendon and giving a peculiar creaking sensation to the finger when the muscle acts. In consequence of its often being caused by such movements as wringing clothes, it is known as ' washerwoman's sprain.' Muscles and Fascia of the Hand Dissection (fig. 301).—Make a transverse incision across the front of the wrist, and a second across the heads of the metacarpal bones : connect the two by a vertical incision in the middle line, and continue it through the centre of the middle finger. The anterior and posterior Fig. 311.—Transverse section through the wrist, annular ligaments, and the palmar fascia, should then be dissected. The Anterior Annular Liga- ment is a strong, fibrous band, which arches over the carpus, converting the deep groove on the front of the carpal bones into a canal, beneath which pass the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is attached, internally, to the pisiform bone and unciform process of the unciform bone ; and externally, to the tuberosity of the scaphoid, and to the inner part of the anterior surface and the ridge on the trapezium. It is continuous, above, with the deep fascia of the forearm, of which it may be regarded as a thickened portion ; and, below, with the palmar fascia. It is crossed by the ulnar vessels and nerve, and the cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves. At its outer extremity is the tendon of the Flexor carpi radiahs, which Hes in the groove on the trapezium between the attachments of the annular hgament to the bone. It has inserted into its anterior surface the tendon of the Palmaris longus H H 2 showing the annular ligaments and the canals for the passage of the tendons.MUSCLES AND FASCIA 468 and part of the tendon of the Flexor carpi uhiaris, and has arismg from it, below, the small muscles of the thmnb and httle finger.

The Synovial Mem- branes of the Flexor Tendons at the Wrist.— There are two synovial membranes which en- close all the tendons as they pass beneath this ligament, one for the Flexor sublimis and profundus digitorum, the other for the Flexor longus pollicis. They extend up into the fore- arm for about an inch above the annular liga- ment, and downwards about half-way along the metacarpal bone, where they terminate in a blind diverticulum around each pair of tendons, with the exception of the thumb and sometimes the little finger ; in these two fingers the diverticulum is continued on and communicates with the synovial sheath of the tendons. In the other three fingers the synovial sheath of the tendons in the fingers begins as a blind pouch without communication with the large synovial sac (fig. 313). Surgical Anatomy.—This arrange- ment of the synovial sheaths explains the fact that thecal abscess in the thumb and little finger is liable to be followed by abscesses in the forearm, from extension of the inflammation along the continuous synovial sheaths. Ganglion is apt to occur in this situa- tion, constituting ' compound palmar ganglion' : it presents an hour-glass outline, with a swelling in front of the v/rist and in the palm of the hand, and a constriction corresponding to the • annular ligament between the two. The fluid can be forced from the one swell- ing to the other under the ligament. The Posterior Annular Liga- ment is a strong, fibrous band, ex- \ ' tending transversely across the back I \^ I of the wrist, and consisting of the 1 ~ — - I (jggp fagcia of the back of the fore- arm, strengthened by the addition of some transverse fibres. It forms a sheath for the extensor tendons in their passage to the fingers, being attached, internally, to the styloid process of the ulna, the cuneiform and pisiform bones; externally, to the margin of the radius ; and, in its passage across the wrist, to the elevated ridges on the posterior surface of the radius. It presents six compart- —Diagram showing the arrangement synovial sheaths of the palm andOF THE HAND 469 ments for the passage of tendons, each of which is lined by a separate synovial membrane. These are, from without inwards:—i. On the outer side of the styloid process, for the tendons of the Extensor ossis metacarpi and Extensor brevis pollicis. 2. Behind the styloid process, for the tendons of the Extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. 3. About the middle of the posterior surface of the radius, for the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis. 4. To the inner side of the latter, for the tendons of the Extensor communis digitorum and Extensor indicis. 5. Opposite the interval between the radius and ulna, for the Extensor minimi digiti. 6. Grooving the back of the ulna, for the tendon of Fig. 314.—Palmar fascia. (Altered from a dissection in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England.) the Extensor carpi ulnaris. The synovial membranes lining these sheaths are usually very extensive, reaching from above the annular ligament, down upon the tendons for a variable distance on the back of the hand. The deep palmar fascia (fig. 314) forms a common sheath which invests the muscles of the hand. It consists of a central and two lateral portions. The central portion occupies the middle of the palm, is triangular in shape, of great strength and thickness, and binds down the tendons in this situation. It is narrow above, being attached to the lower margin of the annular ligament, and receives the expanded tendon of the Palmaris longus muscle. Below, it is broad and expanded, and divides into four slips, for the four fingers. Each slip gives off470 MUSCLES AND FASCIA superficial fibres, which are inserted into the skin of the palm and finger, those to the palm joining the skin at the furrow corresponding to the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation, and those to the fingers passing into the skin at the transverse fold at the base of the fingers. The deeper part of each shp subdivides into two processes, which are inserted into the lateral margins of the anterior (glenoid) ligament of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. From the sides of these processes, offsets are sent backwards, to be attached to the borders of the lateral surfaces of the meta- carpal bones at their distal extremities. By this arrangement short channels are formed on the front of the lower ends of the metacarpal bones, through which the flexor tendons pass. Dr. W. W. Keen describes a fifth slip as frequently found passing to the thumb. The intervals left in the fascia, between the four fibrous slips, transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the Lumbricales. At the points of division of the palmar fascia into the slips above mentioned, numerous strong, transverse fibres bind the separate processes together. The palmar fascia is intimately adherent to the integument by dense fibro-areolar tissue forming the superficial palmar fascia, and gives origin by its inner margin to the Palmaris brevis ; it covers the superficial palmar arch, the tendons of the flexor muscles, and the branches of the median and ulnar nerves ; and on each side it gives off a vertical septum, w^hich is continuous with the interosseous aponeurosis, and separates the lateral from the middle palmar group of muscles. The lateral portions of the palmar fascia are thin, fibrous layers, which cover, on the radial side, the muscles of the ball of the thumb, and, on the ulnar side, the muscles of the little finger; they are continuous with the dorsal fascia, and in the palm with the central portion of the palmar fascia. The Superficial Transverse Ligament of the Fingers is a thin, fibrous band, which stretches across the roots of the four fingers, and is closely attached to the skin of the clefts, and internally to the fifth metacarpal bone, forming a sort of rudimentary web. Beneath it the digital vessels and nerves pass onwards to their destination. Surgical Anatomy.—The palmar fascia is liable to undergo contraction, producing a very inconvenient deformity, known as ' Dupuytren's contraction.' The ring and little fingers are most frequently implicated, but the middle, the index, and the thumb may be involved. The proximal phalanx is drawn down and cannot be straightened, and the two distal phalanges become similarly flexed as the disease advances. Muscles of the Hand The Muscles of the Hand are subdivided into three groups :—i. Those of the thumb, which occupy the radial side. 2. Those of the little finger, which occupy the ulnar side. 3. Those in the middle of the palm and between the interosseous spaces. Radial Eegion (figs. 315, 316) Muscles of tJie Thumb Abductor pollicis. Flexor brevis pollicis. Opponens (Flexor ossis metacarpi) pollicis. Adductor obliquus pollicis. Adductor transversus pollicis. The Abductor pollicis is a thin, flat muscle, placed immediately beneath the integument. It arises from the ridge of the os trapezium and annular ligament ; and, passing outwards and downwards, is inserted by a thin, flat tendon into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, sending a slip to join the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the palmar fascia. By its deep surface, with the Opponens pollicis, from which it is separated by a thin apo- neurosis. Its inner border is separated from the Flexor brevis pollicis by a narrow cellular interval. The Opponens pollicis is a small, triangular muscle, placed beneath theOF THE HAND 471 preceding. It arises from the palmar surface of the trapezimn and annular ligament, passes downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the thumb on its radial side. Relations.—By its suiDerficial surface, with the Abductor pollicis. By its deep surface, with the trapezio-metacarpal articulation. By its inner border, with the Flexor brevis pollicis. The Flexor brevis pollicis is much larger than either of the two preceding muscles, beneath which it is placed. It consists of two portions, outer and inner. The outer and more superficial portion arises from the trapezium and outer two- thirds of the annular ligament, and passes along the outer side of the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis ; and, becoming tendinous, has a sesamoid bone developed Fig. 315.—Muscles of thumb. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons of England.) ABDUCTOR POLL. in its tendon, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. The inner and deeper portion of the muscle is very small, and arises from the ulnar side of the first metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx with the Adductor obliquus pollicis. A sesamoid bone is developed in the common tendon of insertion. Relations.—By its stiperficial surface, with the palmar fascia. • By its deep surface, with the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis. By its external surface, with the Opponens pollicis. By its internal stirface, with the Adductor obliquus pollicis. The Adductor obliquus pollicis arises by several slips from the os magnum, the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, the anterior annular ligament, and the sheath of the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis. From this origin the greater number of fibres pass obliquely downwards and converge to a tendon, which, uniting with the tendons of the deeper portion of the Flexor brevis pollicis and the Adductor transversus, is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, a sesamoid bone being developed in the tendon of insertion. A considerable fasciculus, however, passes more obliquely outwards beneath the472 MUSCLES AND FASCIA tendon of the long flexor to join the superficial portion of the short flexor and the Abductor pollicis.* Relations.—By its stq^erficial surface, with the Flexor longus polhcis and the outer head of the Flexor brevis polhcis. Its deej) sitrface covers the Adductor Fig. 316.—Muscles of the left hand. Palmar surface. transversus polhcis, and is in relation with the deep palmar arch, which passes between the two adductors. The Adductor transversus pollicis (fig. 315) is the most deeply seated of this group ot muscles. It is of a triangular form, arising, by its broad base, from the lower two-thn^ds of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger on its palmar surface ; * This muscle was formerly described as the deep portion of the Flexor brevis polhcis.OF THE HAND 473 the fibres, proceeding outwards, converge, to be inserted, with the inner tendon of the Flexor brevis polhcis, and the Adductor obhquus pollicis, into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. From the common tendon of insertion a slip is prolonged to the Extensor longus pollicis. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Adductor obliquus pollicis, the tendons of the Flexor profundus, and the Lumbricales. Its deep surface covers the first two interosseous spaces, from which it is separated by a strong aponeurosis. Three of these muscles of the thumb, the Abductor, the Adductor transversus, and the Flexor brevis pollicis, at their insertions, give off fibrous expansions which join the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis. This permits of flexion of the proximal phalanx and extension of the terminal phalanx at the same time. These expansions, originally figured by Albinus, have been more recently described by M. Duchenne, ' Physiologie des Mouvements,' page 299. Nerves.—The Abductor, Opponens, and outer head of the Flexor brevis pollicis are supplied by the median nerve ; the inner head of the Flexor brevis, and the Adductors, by the ulnar nerve. Actions.—The actions of the muscles of the thumb are almost sufficiently indi- cated by their names. This segment of the hand is provided with three extensors —an extensor of the metacarpal bone, an extensor of the first, and an extensor of the second phalanx; these occupy the dorsal surface of the forearm and hand. There are also three flexors on the palmar surface—a flexor of the metacarpal bone, a flexor of the proximal, and a flexor of the terminal phalanx ; there is also an Abductor and two Adductors. The Abductor pollicis moves the metacarpal bone of the thumb outwards, that is, away from the index finger. The Flexor ossis metacarpi pollicis flexes the metacarpal bone, that is, draws it inwards over the palm, and at the same time rotates the bone, so as to turn the ball of the thumb towards the fingers, thus producing the movement of opposition. The Flexor brevis pollicis flexes the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The Adductores pollicis move the metacarpal bone of the thumb inwards, that is, towards the index finger. These muscles give to the thumb its extensive range of motion. It will be noticed, however, that in consequence of the position of the first meta- carpal bone, these movements differ from the corresponding movements of the metacarpal bones of the other fingers. Thus extension of the thumb more nearly corresponds to the motion of abduction in the other fingers, and flexion to adduction. Ulnae Region (fig. 316) Palmaris brevis. Muscles of the Little Finger Abductor minimi digiti. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Opponens (Flexor ossis metacarpi) minimi digiti. The Palmaris brevis is a thin quadrilateral muscle, placed beneath the integu- ment on the ulnar side of the hand. It arises by tendinous fasciculi, from the annular ligament and palmar fascia ; the fleshy fibres pass inwards, to be inserted into the skin on the inner border of the palm of the hand. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the integument, to which it is intimately adherent,.especially by its inner extremity. By its deep surface, with the inner portion of the palmar fascia ; which separates it from the ulnar vessels and nerve, and from the muscles of the ulnar side of the hand. The Abductor minimi digiti is situated on the ulnar border of the palm of the hand. It arises from the pisiform bone, and terminates in a flat tendon, which divides into two slips ; one passes under the lateral expansion of the extensor tendon, opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. The other slip passes over the expansion, and is inserted into the ulnar border of the shaft of the same phalanx.MUSCLES AND FASCI/E 474 Relations.—By its stqjerficial surface, with the inner x^ortion of the pahnar fascia, and the Pahnaris brevis. By its deep surface, with the Flexor ossis meta- carpi minimi digiti. By its outer border, with the Flexor brevis minimi digiti. The Flexor brevis minimi dig^iti lies on the same plane as the preceding muscle, on its radial side. It arises from the tip of the unciform process of the unciform bone, and anterior surface of the annular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. It is separated from the Abductor at its origin, by the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. This muscle is sometimes wanting; the Abductor is then, usually, of large size. Relations.—By its siqjerficicd surface, with the internal portion of the palmar fascia, and the Palmaris brevis. By its deep surface, with the Opponens. The Opponens minimi digiti (fig. 307) is of a triangular form, and placed immediately beneath the preceding muscles. It arises from the unciform process of the unciform bone, and contiguous portion of the annular ligament ; its fibres pass downwards and inwards, to be inserted into the whole length of the meta- carpal bone of the little finger, along its ulnar margin. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Flexor brevis, -and Abductor minimi digiti. By its deep surface, with the Interossei muscles in the fourth metacarpal space, the metacarpal bone, and the Flexor tendons of the little finger. Nerves.—All the muscles of this group are supplied by the ulnar nerve. Actions.—The Abductor minimi digiti abducts the little finger from the middle line of the hand. It corresponds to a dorsal interosseous muscle. It also assists in flexing the proximal phalanx. The Flexor brevis minimi digiti abducts the little finger from the middle line of the hand. It also assists in flexing the proximal phalanx. The Opponens minimi digiti draws forwards the fifth metacarpal bone, so as to deepen the hollow of the palm. The Palmaris brevis corrugates the skin on the inner side of the palm of the hand. Middle Palmar Eegion Lumbricales. Interossei palmares. Interossei dorsales. The Lumbricales (fig. 316) are four small fleshy fasciculi, accessories to the deep Flexor muscle. They arise by fleshy fibres from the tendons of the deep Flexor : the first and second, from the radial side and palmar surface of the tendons of the index and middle fingers ; the third, from the contiguous sides of the ten- dons of the middle and ring fingers ; and the fourth, from the contiguous sides of the tendons of the ring and little fingers. They pass to the radial side of the corresponding fingers, and opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation each tendon terminates in a broad aponeurosis, which is inserted into the tendinous expansion from the Extensor communis digitorum, covering the dorsal aspect of each finger. The Interossei muscles are so named from occupying the intervals between the metacarpal bones. They are divided into two sets, a dorsal and palmar : the former are four in number, one in each metacarpal space; the latter, three in number, lie upon the metacarpal bones. The Dorsal interossei are four in number, larger than the palmar, and occupy the intervals between the metacarpal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, but more extensively from that side of the metacarpal bone which corresponds to the side of the finger in which the muscle is inserted. They are inserted into the bases of the first phalanges and into the aponeurosis of the common extensor tendon. Between the double origin of each of these muscles is a narrow triangular interval, through the first of which passes the radial artery; through the other three passes a perforating branch from the deep palmar arch. The First dorsal interosseous muscle, or Abductor indicis, is larger than the others. It is flat, triangular in form, and arises by two heads, separated by aSURFACE FORM 475 fibrous arch, for the passage of the radial artery from the dorsum to the pahn of the hand. The outer head arises from the upper half of the ulnar border of the first metacarpal bone ; the inner head, from almost the entire length of the radial border of the second metacarpal bone ; the tendon is inserted into the radial side of the index finger. The second and third dorsal interossei are inserted into the middle finger, the former into its radial, the latter into its ulnar side. The fourth is inserted into the ulnar side of the ring finger. The Palmar interossei, three in number, are smaller than the Dorsal, and placed upon the palmar surface of the metacarpal bones, rather than between them. They arise from the entire length of the metacarpal bone of one finger, and are inserted into the side of the base of the first phalanx and aponeurotic expansion of the common extensor tendon of the same finger. The first arises from the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the same side of the index finger. The second arises from the radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the same side of the ring finger. The tJiwd arises from the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and is Fig. 317.—The Dorsal interossei of Fig. 318.—The Palmar interossei of left hand. left hand. inserted into the same side of the little finger. From this account it may be seen that each finger is provided with two Interossei muscles, with the exception of the little finger, in which the Abductor muscle takes the place of one of the pair. Nerves.—The two outer Lumbricales are supplied by the median nerve ; the rest of the muscles of this group by the ulnar. All the Interossei are supplied by the ulnar. Actions.—The Palmar interossei muscles adduct the fingers to an imaginary line drawn longitudinally through the centre of the middle finger; and the Dorsal interossei abduct the fingers from that line. In addition to this, the Interossei, in conjunction with the Lumbricales, flex the first phalanx at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and extend the second and third phalanges in consequence of their insertion into the expansion of the extensor tendons. The Extensor communis digitorum is believed to act almost entirely on the first phalanges. Surface Form.—ThePectorcdis major largely influences surface form and conceals a considerable part of the thoracic wall in front. Its sternal origin presents a festooned border, which bounds and determines the width of the sternal farrow. Its clavicular originMUSCLES AND FASCIiE 476 is somewhat depressed and flattened, and between the two portions of the muscle is often an obhque depression, wliicli differentiates the one from the other. The outer margin of the muscle is generally well marked above, and bounds the infraclavicular fossa, a triangular interval which separates the Pectoralis major from the Deltoid. It gradually becomes less marked as it approaches the tendon of insertion, and becomes more closely blended with the Deltoid muscle. Tlie lower border of the Pectoralis major forms the rounded anterior axillary fold, and corresponds with the direction of the fifth rib. The Pectoralis minor influences surface form. When the arm is raised, its lowest slip of origin produces a local fulness just below the border of the anterior fold of the axilla, and so serves to break the sharp line of the lower border of the Pectoralis major muscle which is produced when the arm is in this position. The origin of the Serratus magnus produces a very characteristic surface marking. When the arm is raised from the side, in a well-developed subject, the five or six lower serrations are plainly discernible, forming a zigzag line, caused by the series of digitations, which diminish in size from above downwards, and have their apices arranged in the form of a curve. When the arm is lying by the side, the first serration to appear, at the lower margin of the Pectoralis major, is the one attached to the fifth rib. The Deltoid, with the prominence of the upper extremity of the humerus, produces the rounded outline of the shoulder. It is rounder and fuller in front than behind, where it presents a somewhat flattened form. Its anterior border, above, presents a rounded, slightly curved eminence, which bounds externally the infraclavicular fossa ; below, it is closely united with the Pectoralis major. Its posterior border is thin, flattened, and scarcely marked above ; below, it is thicker and more prominent. When the muscle is in action, the middle portion becomes irregular, presenting alternate longitudinal elevations and depressions : the elevations corresponding to the fleshy portions ; the depressions, to the tendinous intersections of the muscle. The insertion of the Deltoid is marked by a depression on the outer side of the middle of the arm. Of the scapular muscles, the only one which materially influences surface form is the Teres major, which assists the Latissimus dorsi in forming the thick, rounded fold of the posterior boundary of the axilla. AVhen the arm is raised, the Coraco-brachialis reveals itself as a long, narrow elevation, which emerges from under cover of the anterior fold of the axilla and runs downwards, internal to the shaft of the humerus. When the arm is hanging by the side, its front and inner part presents the prominence of the Biceps, bounded on either side by an intermuscular depression. This muscle determines the contour of the front of the arm, and extends from the anterior margin of the axilla to the bend of the elbow. Its upper tendons are concealed by the Pectoralis major and the Deltoid, and its lower tendon sinks into the space at the bend of the elbow. When the muscle is in a state of complete contraction—that is to say, when the forearm has been flexed and supinated—it presents a rounded convex form, bulged out laterally and its length is diminished. On each side of the Biceps, at the lower part of the arm, the BrachiaMs anticus is discernible. On the outer side it forms a narrow eminence, which extends some distance up the arm along the border of the Biceps. On the inner side it shows itself only as a little fulness just above the elbow. On the back of the arm the long head of the Triceps may be seen as a longitudinal eminence emerging from under cover of the Deltoid, and gradually merging into the longitudinal flattened plane of the muscle on the lower part of the back of the arm. On the anterior aspect of the elbow are to be seen two muscular elevations, one on each side, separated above, and converging below so as to form a triangular space. Of these, the inner elevation, consisting of the flexors and pronator, forms the prominence along the inner side and front of the forearm. It is a fusiform mass, pointed above at the internal cond^de and gradually tapering off below. The Pronator radii teres, the innermost muscle of the group, forms the boundary of the triangular space at the bend of the elbow. It is shorter, less prominent, and more oblique than the outer boundary. The most prominent part of the eminence is produced by the Flexor carpi radialis, the muscle next in order on the inner side of the preceding one. It forms a rounded prominence above, and can be traced downwards to its tendon, which can be felt lying on the front of the wrist, nearer to the radial than to the ulnar border and to the inner side of the radial artery. The Pahnaris longus presents no surface marking above, but, below, is the most prominent tendon on the front of the wrist, standing out, when the muscle is in action, as a sharp tense cord beneath the skin. The Flexor sublimis digitorum does not directly influence surface form. The position of its four tendons on the front of the lower part of the forearm is indicated by an elongated depression between the tendons of the Palmaris longus and the Flexor carpi ulnaris. The Flexor ca rpi ulnar is occupies a small part of the posterior surface of the forearm, and is separated from the extensor and supinator group, which occupies the greater part of this surface, by the ulnar furrow, produced by the subcutaneous posterior border of the ulna. Its tendon can be perceived along the ulnar border of the front of the forearm, and is most marked when the hand is flexed and adducted. The deep muscles of the front of the forearm have no direct influence on surface form. The external group of muscles of the forearm, consisting of the extensors and supinators, occupy the outer, and a considerable portion of the posterior, surface of this region. They form a fusiform mass, which is altogether on a higher level than the pronato-flexor group. Its apex emerges from between the Triceps and Brachialis anticus muscles some distance above the elbow-joint, and acquires its greatest breadth oppositeSUEFACE FOEM 477 the external condyle, and thence gradually shades off hito a flattened surface. About the middle of the forearm it divides into two longitudinal eminences which diverge from each other, leaving a triangular interval between them. The outer of these two groups of muscles consists of the Supinator longus and the Extensor carpi radialis longior et brevior, which form a longitudinal eminence descending from the external condyloid ridge in the direction of the styloid process of the radius. The other and more posterior group consists of the Extensor communis digitorum, the Extensor minimi digiti, and the Extensor ca^rpi ulnaris. It commences above as a tapering form at the external condyle of the humerus, and is separated behind at its upper part from the Anconeus by a well- marked furrow ; and below, from the pronato-flexor mass, by the ulnar furrow. In the triangular interval left between these two groups, the extensors of the thumb and index finger are seen. The only two muscles of this region which require special mention, as independently influencing surface form, are the Supinator longus and the Anconeus. The inner border of the Supinator longus forms the outer boundary of the triangular space at the bend of the elbow. It commences as a rounded border above the condyle, and is longer, less oblique, and more prominent than the inner boundary. Lower down, the muscle forms a full fleshy mass on the outer side of the upper part of the forearm, and below tapers into a tendon, which may be traced down to the styloid process of the radius. The Anconeus presents a well-marked and characteristic surface form in the shape of a triangular, slightly elevated surface, immediately external to the subcutaneous posterior surface of the olecranon, and differentiated from the common extensor group by a well-marked oblique longitudinal depression. The upper angle of the triangle corre- sponds to the external condyle, and is marked by a depression or dimple in this situation. In the triangular interval, caused by the divergence from each other of the two groups of muscles into which the extensor and supinator group is divided at the lower part of the forearm, an oblique elongated eminence is seen, caused by the emergence of two of the extensors of the thumb from their deep origin at the back of the forearm. This eminence, full above, and becoming flattened out and partially subdivided below, runs downwards and outwards over the back and outer surface of the radius to the outer side of the wrist- joint, where it forms a ridge, especially marked when the thumb is extended, which passes onwards to the posterior aspect of the thumb. The tendons of most of the extensor muscles are to be seen and felt at the level of the wrist-joint. Most externally are the tendons of the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and the Extensor brevis pollicis, forming a vertical ridge over the outer side of the joint from the styloid process of the radius to the thumb. Internal to this is the oblique ridge produced by the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis, very noticeable when the muscle is in action. The Extensor carpi radialis longior is scarcely to be felt, but the Extensor carpi radialis brevior can be distinctly perceived, as a vertical ridge emerging from under the inner border of the tendon of the Extensor longus pollicis, when the hand is forcibl}^ extended at the wrist. Internal to this, again, can be felt the tendons of the Extensor indicis. Extensor communis digitorum, and Extensor minimi digiti ; the latter tendon being sepa- rated from those of the common extensor by a slight furrow. The muscles of the hand are principally concerned, as far as regards surface-form, in producing the thenar and hypo- thenar eminences, and individually are not to be distinguished, on the surface, from each other The Adductor transversiis j^oUicis is, however, an exception to this; its anterior border gives rise to a ridge across the web of skin connecting the thumb to the rest of the hand. The thenar eminence is much larger and rounder than the hypothenar one, which presents a longer and narrower eminence along the ulnar side of the hand. When the Palmaris brevis is in action it produces a wrinkling of the skin over the hypothenar eminence, and a deep dimple on the ulnar border of the hand. The anterior extremities of the Lumhrica l muscles help to produce the soft eminences just behind the clefts of the fingers, separated from each other by depressions corresponding to the flexor tendons in their sheaths. Between the thenar and hypothenar eminences, at the wrist-joint, is a slight groove or depression, widening out as it approaches the fingers ; beneath this we have the strong- central part of the palmar fascia. Here we have some furrows, which are pretty constant in their arrangement, and bear some resemblance to the letter M. One of these furrows passes obliquely outwards from the groove between the thenar and hypothenar regions to the head of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. A second passes inwards, with a slight inclination upwards, from the termination of the first to the ulnar side of the hand. A third runs parallel with the second and about three-quarters of an inch below it. Lastly, crossing these two latter furrows is an oblique furrow parallel with the first. The skin of the palm of the hand differs considerably from that of the forearm. At the wrist it suddenly becomes hard and dense, and covered with a thick laj^er of cuticle. The skin in the thenar region presents these characteristics less than elsewhere. In spite of this hardness and density the skin of the palm is exceedingly sensitive and very vascular. It is destitute of hair, and no sebaceous follicles have been found in this region. Over the fingers the skin again becomes thinner, especially at the flexures of the joints, and over the terminal phalanges it is thrown into numerous parallel ridges in consequence of the arrangement of the papillae in it. The superficial fascia in the palm is made up of dense fibro-fatty tissue. This tissue binds down the skin so firmly to the deep palmar fascia that very little movement is permitted between the two. On the back of the hand, theSUEGICAL ANATOMY OF 478 Dorsal interossei produce elongated swellings between the metacarpal bones. The first dorsal interosseous (Abductor indicis), when the thumb is closely adducted to the hand, forms a prominent fusiform bulging ; the other interossei are not so marked. SUEGICAL ANATOMY The student, having completed the dissection of the muscles of the upper extremity, should consider the effects likely to be produced by the action of the various muscles in fracture of the bones. In considering the actions of the various muscles upon fractures of the upper extremity, I have selected the most common forms of injury, both for illustration and description. Fracture of the middle of the clavicle (fig. 319) is always attended with considerable displacement, the inner end of the outer fragment is displaced inwards and backwards, while the outer end of the same fragment is rotated forwards, owing to the displacement backwards of its inner end. The whole outer fragment is somewhat depressed. The displacement is produced as follows : inwards, by the muscles passing from the chest to the outer fragment of the clavicle, to the scapula, and to the humerus, viz. the Subclavius, the Pectoralis minor and major, and the Latissimus dorsi; backwards, with consequent rotation of thp outer end of the outer fragment forwards by the Pectoral Fig. 319.—Fracture^of the middle of muscles. " The depression of the whole outer + „ ^ ^ fi^agment is produced by the weight of the arm and by the contraction of the Deltoid. The outer end of the inner fi'agment appears to be elevated, the skin being drawn tensely over it; this is owing to the depression of the outer fragment, as the inner fi-agment is usuallj^ kept fixed hj the costo-clavicular ligament, and by the antagonism between the Sterno- mastoid and Pectoralis major muscles. But it may be raised by an unusually strong Sterno- mastoid, or by the inner end of the outer fragment getting below and behind it. The causes of displacement having been ascer- tained, it is easy to apply the a2)propriate treatment. The outer fragment is to be drawn outwards, and, together with the scapula, raised upwards to a level with the inner fragment, and retained in that position. In fracture of the acromial end o f the clavicle, between the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, only slight displacement occurs, as these ligaments, from their oblique inser- tion, serve to hold both portions of the bone in apposition. Fracture, also, of the sternal end, internal to the costo-clavicular ligament, is attended with only slight displacement, this ligament serving to retain the fragments in close apposition. Fracture of the acromion process usually arises from violence applied to the upper and outer part of the shoulder; it is generally known by the rotundity of the shoulder being lost, from the Deltoid drawing the fractured portion downwards and forwards; and the displacement may easily be discovered by tracing the margin of the clavicle outwards, when the fragment will be found resting on the front and upper part of the head of the humerus. In order to relax the anterior and outer fibres of the Deltoid (the opposing muscle), the arm should be drawn forwards across the chest, and the elbow well raised, so that the head of the bone may press the acromion process upwards, and retain it in its i^osition. Fracture of the coracoid jJrocess is an extremely rare accident, and is usually caused by a sharp blow on the point of the shoulder. Displacement is here produced by the combined actions of the Pectoralis minor, short head of the Biceps, and Coraco-brachialis, the former muscle drawing the fragment inwards, and the latter directly downwards, the amount of displacement being limited by the connection of this process to the acromion by means of the coraco-acromial ligament. In order to relax these muscles and replace the fragments in close apposition, the forearm should be flexed so as to relax the Biceps, and the arm drawn forwards and inwards across the chest so as to relax the Coraco- brachialis; the humerus should then be pushed upwards against the coraco-acromial ligament, and the arm retained in that position. Fracture of the surgical neck of the hmner^is (fig. 320) is very common, is attended with considerable displacement, and its appearances correspond somewhat with those of disloca- tion of the head of the humerus into the axilla. The upper fragment is slightly elevatedTHE MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 479 Fig. 320.—Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. under the coraco-acromial ligament by the muscles attached to the greater and lesser tuber- osities ; the lower fragment is drawn inwards by the Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major; and the humerus is thrown obliquely outwards from the side by the Deltoid, and occasionally elevated so as to project beneath and in front of the coracoid process. The deformity is reduced by fixing the shoulder, and drawing the arm outwards and down- wards. To counteract the opposing muscles, and to keep the fragments in position, the arm should be drawn from the side, and pasteboard splints applied on its four sides ; a large conical-shaped pad should be placed in the axilla, with the base turned upwards and the elbow approximated to the side, and retained there by a broad roller passed round the chest; the forearm should then be flexed, and the hand supported in a sling, care being taken not to raise the elbow, otherwise the lower frag- ment may be displaced upwards. In fracture of the shaft of the humerus below the insertion of the Pectoralis major, Latissimus dorsi, and Teres major, and above the insertion of the Deltoid, there is also considerable deformity, the upper fragment being drawn inwards by the first-mentioned muscles, and the lower fragment upwards and outwards by the Deltoid, producing shortening of the limb, and a considerable promi- nence at the seat of fracture, from the fractured ends of the bone riding over one another, especially if the fracture takes place in an oblique direction. The fragments may be brought into apposition by extension from the elbow, and retained in that position by adopting the same njeans as in the preceding injury. In fractures of the shaft of the humerus immediately below the insertion of the Deltoid, the amount of deformity depends greatly upon the direction of the fracture. If it occurs in a transverse direction, only slight displacement takes place, the upper fragment being drawn a little forwards; but in oblique fracture, the combined actions of the Biceps and Brachialis anticus muscles in front, and the Triceps behind, draw upwards the lower fragment, causing it to glide over the upper fragment, either backwards or forwards, according to the direction of the fracture. Simple extension reduces the defor- mity, and the application of splints on the four sides of the arm will retain the fragments in apposition. Care should be taken not to raise the elbow ; but the forearm and hand may be supported in a sling. Fracture of the humerus (fig. 321) immediately above the condyles deserves very attentive con- sideration, as the general appearances correspond somewhat with those produced by separation of the epiphysis of the humerus, and with those of disloca- tion of the radius and ulna backwards. If the direc- tion of the fracture is oblique from above, down- wards, and forwards, the lower fragment is drawn upwards and backwards by the Brachialis anticus and Biceps in front, and the Triceps behind. This injury may be diagnosed from dislocation by the in- creased mobility in fracture, the existence of crepi- tus, and the fact of the deformity being remedied by extension, on the discontinuance of which it is repro- duced. The age of the patient is of importance in distinguishing this form of injury from separation of the epiphysis. If fracture occurs in the opposite direction to that shown in the accompanying figure, the lower fragment is drawn upwards and forwards, causing a considerable prominence in front; and the upper fragment projects backwards beneath the tendon of the Triceps muscle. Fracture of the olecranon jprocess (fig. 322) is a frequent accident. The detached fragment is displaced upwards, by the action of the Triceps muscle, from half an inch to two inches ; the prominence of the elbow is consequently lost, and a deep hollow is felt at the back part of the joint, which is much increased on flexing the limb. The patient at the same time loses, more or less, the power of extending the forearm. The treatment consists in relaxing the Triceps by extending the limb, and retaining it in the extended position by means of a long straight splint applied to the front of the arm ; the fragments are thus brought into close apposition, and may be further approximated by drawing down the upper fragment. Union is generally ligamentous. Fig. 321.—Fracture of the humerus above the condyles.480 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF Fracture of the necTi of the radius is an exceedingly rare accident, and is generally caused by direct violence. Its diagnosis is somewhat obscure, on account of the slight deformity visible, the injured part being surrounded by a large number of muscles ; but the movements of pronation and supination are entirely lost. The upper fragment is drawn outwards by the Supinator brevis, its extent of displacement being limited by the attachment of the orbicular ligament. The lower fragment is drawn forwards and slightly ui:)wards by the Biceps, and in- FiG. 322.—Fracture of the olecranon. wards by the Pronator radii teres, its dis- placement forwards and upwards being comiteracted in some degree by the Su- pinator brevis. The treatment essentially consists in relaxing the Biceps, Supinator brevis, and Pronator radii teres muscles, by flexing the forearm, and placing it in a position jnidway between pronation and supination, extension having been previ- ously made so as to bring the parts in apposition. In fracture of the radius (fig. 323) near its centre, the upper fragment is drawn upwards by the Biceps, and inwards by the Pronator radii teres, holding a position midway between pronation and supination, and a degree of fulness in the upper half of the forearm is thus produced : the lower fragment is drawn downwards and inwards towards the ulna by the Pronator quadra tus, and thrown into a state of pronation by the same muscle ; at the same time, the Supinator longus, by elevating the styloid process, into which it is inserted, will serve to depress the upper end of the lower fragment still more towards the ulna. In order to relax the opposing muscles the forearm should be bent, and the limb placed in a position midway between pronation and supination; the fracture is then easily reduced by extension from the wrist and elbow : well-padded splints should be applied on both sides of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist; the hand being allowed to fall, will, by its own weight, counteract the action of the Pronator quadratus and Supinator longus, and elevate the lower fragment to the level of the Fig. 323.—Fracture of the shaft of the radius. upper one. In fracture of the shaft of the ulna the upper fragment retains its usual posi- tion, but the lower fragment is drawn out- wards towards the radius by the Pronator quadratus, producing a well-marked depres- sion at the seat of fracture, and some ful- ness on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the forearm. The fracture is easily reduced by extension from the wrist and forearm. The forearm should be flexed, and placed in a position midway between pronation and supination, and well-padded splints apphed from the elbow to the ends of the fingers. In fracture of the shafts of the radius and ulna together, the lower fragments are drawn upwards, sometimes forwards, sometimes backwards, according to the direction of the fracture, by the combined actions of the Flexor and Extensor muscles, producing a degree of fulness on the dorsal or palmar surface of the forearm ; at the same time the two fragments are drawn into contact by the Pronator quadratus, the radius being in a state of'pronation : the upper fragment of the radius is drawn upwards and inwards by the Biceps and Pronator radii teres'to a higher level than the ulna; the upper portion of the ulna is slightly elevated by the Brachiahs anticus. The fracture may be reduced by extension froni the wrist and elbow, and the forearm should be placed in the same position as in fracture of the ulna. In fracture of the loiuer end of the radius (fig. 324) the displacement which is produced is very considerable, and bears some resemblance to dislocation of the carpus backwards, from which it should be carefully distinguished. The lower fragment is drawn upwards and backwards behind the upper fragment by the combined actions of the Supinator longus and the flexors and the extensors of the thumb and carpus, producing a well-marked pro- minence on the back of the wrist, with a deep depression above it. The upper fragment projects forwards, often lacerating the substance of the Pronator quadratus, and is drawn by this muscle into close contact with the lower end of the ulna, causing a projection on the anterior surface of the forearm, immediately above the carpus, from the flexor tendons being thrust forwards. This fracture may be distinguished from dislocation by the deformity being removed on making sufficient extension, when crepitus maybe occasionallyTHE MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY detected; at the same time, on extension being discontinued, the parts immediately resume their deformed appearance (see also page 234). The age of the patient will also assist in determining whether the injm'-y is fracture or separation of the epiphysis. The treatment consists in flexing the forearm, and making powerful extension from the wrist and elbov/, Fig. 324.—Fracture of the lower end of the radius. depressing at the same time the radial side of the hand, and retaining the parts in that position by well-padded pistol-shajjed splints.

D'issection.—No detailed description is required for the dissection of these muscles. On the removal of the viscera from the abdomen, they are exposed, covered by the peritoneum and a thin layer of fascia, the iliac fascia. The iliac fascia* is the aponeurotic layer which lines the back part of the abdominal cavity, and covers the Psoas and Iliacus muscles throughout their whole" extent. It is thin above, and becomes gradually thicker below as it approaches the crural arch. The i^ortion covering the Psoas is attached, above, to the ligamentum arcuatum internum ; internally, by a series of arched processes to the intervertebral substances, and prominent margins of the bodies of the vertebrae, and to the upper part of the sacrum ; the intervals so left, opposite the constricted portions of the bodies, transmitting the lumbar arteries and filaments of the sympathetic nerve. Ex- ternally, above the crest of the ilium, this portion of the iliac fascia is continuous with the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia (see page 410), but below the crest of the ilium it is continuous with the fascia covering the Iliacus. The portion, investing the Iliacus is connected, externally, to the whole length of the inner border of the crest of the ilium; and internally, to the brim of the true pelvis, where it is continuous with the periosteum, and at the ilio-pectineal eminence it receives the tendon of insertion of the Psoas parvus, when that muscle exists. External to the femoral vessels, this fascia is intimately connected to the posterior margin of Poupart's ligament, and is continuous with the fascia trans- versalis. Internal to the vessels it is attached to the ilio-pectineal line behind the conjoined tendon, where it is again continuous with the transversalis fascia ; and corresponding to the point where the femoral vessels pass into the thigh, this fascia descends behind them forming the posterior wall of the crural sheath. This portion of the iliac fascia which passes behind the femoral vessels is also attached to the ilio-pectineal line beyond the limits of the attachment of the conjoined tendon; at this part it is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata of the thigh. The external iliac vessels lie in front of the iliac fascia, but all the branches of the lumbar plexus behind it; it is separated from the peritoneum by a quantity of loose areolar tissue. The Psoas magnus (fig. 326) is a long fusiform muscle, placed on the side of the lumbar region of the spine and margin of the pelvis. It arises from the front of the bases and lower borders of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae by five fleshy slips; also from the sides of the bodies, and the corresponding intervertebral substances of the last dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrae. The muscle is connected to the bodies of the vertebrae by five slips ; each slip is attached to the upper and lower margins of two vertebrae, and to the intervertebral substance between them ; the slips themselves being connected by the tendinous arches which extend across the constricted part of the bodies, and beneath which pass the lumbar arteries and sympathetic nerves. These tendinous arches also give origin to muscular fibres, and protect the blood-vessels and nerves from pressure during the * The student must not confound this fascia with the iliac portion of the fascia lata (see p. 486).483 OF THE LOWEE EXTREMITY action of the muscle. The first sHp is attached to the contiguous margins of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae ; the last to the contiguous margins of the fourth and fifth lumbar, and to the intervertebral substance. From these points the muscle passes down across the brim of the pelvis, and, diminishing gradually in size, passes beneath Poupart's ligament, and terminates in a tendon, which, after receiving the fibres of the Iliacus, is inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. Relations.—In the lumbar region. By its anterior surface, which is placed behind the peritoneum, with the iliac fascia, the ligamentum arcuatum internum, the kidney, Psoas parvus, renal vessels, ureiier, spermatic vessels, genito-crural nerve, and the colon. By its jjosterior surface, with the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and the Quadratus lumborum, from which it is separated by the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. The anterior crural nerve is at first situated in the substance of the muscle, and emerges from its outer border at the lower part. The lumbar plexus is situated in the posterior part of the substance of the muscle. By its inner side, the muscle is in relation with the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, the lumbar arteries, the ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, and their branches of communication with the spinal nerves ; the lumbar glands ; the vena cava inferior on the right, and the aorta on the left side, and along the brim of the pelvis with the external iliac artery. In the thigh it is in relation, in front, with the fascia lata ; behind, with the capsular ligament of the hip, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, which frequently communicates with the cavity of the joint through an opening of variable size ; by its inner border, with the Pectineus and the femoral artery, which slightly overlaps it; by its outer border, with the anterior crural nerve and Iliacus muscle. The Psoas parvus is a long slender muscle, placed in front of the Psoas magnus. It arises from the sides of the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae and from the intervertebral substance between them. It forms a small flat muscular bundle, which terminates in a long flat tendon, inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and, by its outer border, into the iliac fascia. This muscle is often absent, and, according to Cruveilhier, sometimes double. Relations.—It is covered by the peritoneum, and, at its origin, by the ligamentum arcuatum internum ; it rests on the Psoas magnus. The Iliacus is a flat, triangular muscle, which fills up the whole of the iliac fossa. It arises from the upper two-thirds of this fossa, and from the inner margin of the crest of the ilium; behind, from the ilio-lumbar ligament, and base of the sacrum ; in front, from the anterior superior and anterior inferior spinous processes of the ilium, from the notch between them, and by a few fibres from the capsule of the hip-joint. The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer side of the tendon of the Psoas, some of them being prolonged into the oblique line which extends from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera.* Relations.—Within the pelvis : by its anterior surface, with the iliac fascia, which separates the muscle from the peritoneum, and with the external cutaneous nerve ; on the right side, with the caecum ; on the left side, with the sigmoid flexure of the colon. By its posterior surface, with the iliac fossa. By its inner border, with the Psoas magnus, and anterior crural nerve. In the thigh, it is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the fascia lata, Rectus, and Sartorius ; behind, with the capsule of the hip-joint, a synovial bursa common to it and the Psoas magnus being interposed. Nerves.—The Psoas magnus, and the Psoas parvus when it exists, are supplied by the anterior branches of the lumbar nerves ; the Iliacus by the anterior crural. Actions.—The Psoas and Iliacus muscles, acting from above, flex the thigh upon the pelvis, and, at the same time, rotate the femur outwards, from the obliquity of their insertion into the inner and back part of that bone. Acting from below, the femur being fixed, the muscles of both sides bend the lumbar * The Psoas and Iliacus are sometimes regarded as a single muscle, the Ilio-psoas, having two heads of origin and a single insertion. 112MUSCLES AND FASCLE 484 portion of the spine and pelvis forwards. They also serve to maintain the erect position, by supporting the spine and pelvis upon the femur, and assist in raising the trunk when the body is in the recumbent posture. The Psoas parvus is a tensor of the iliac fascia. Surgical Ana tomy.—In the iliac fascia there is no definite septum between the portions of fascia covering the Psoas and Iliacus respectively, and the fascia is only connected to the subjacent muscles by a quantity of loose connective tissue. When abscess forms beneath this fascia, as it is very apt to do, the matter is contained in an osseo-fibrous cavity which is closed on all sides within the abdomen, and is open only at its lower part, where the fascia is prolonged over the muscle into the thigh. Abscess Avithin the sheath of the Psoas muscle [Psoas abscess) is generally due to tubercular caries of the bodies of the lower dorsal and hmibar vertebrae. When the disease is in the dorsal region, the matter tracts down the posterior mediastinum, in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, and, passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum, enters the sheath of the Psoas muscle, down which it passes as far as the pelvic brim ; it then gets beneath the iliac portion of the fascia, and fills up the iliac fossa. In consequence of the attachment of the fascia to the pelvic brim, it rarely finds its way into the pelvis, but passes by a narrow opening under Poupart's ligament into the thigh, to the outer side of the femoral vessels. It thus follows that a Psoas abscess may be described as consisting of four parts : (1) a somewhat narrow channel at its upper part, in the Psoas sheath ; (2) a dilated sac in the iliac fossa; (3) a constricted neck luider Poupart's ligament ; and (4) a dilated sac in the upper part of the thigh. When the lumbar vertebrae are the seat of the disease, the matter finds its way directly into the substance of the muscle. The muscular fibres are destroyed, and the nervous cords contained in the abscess are isolated and exposed in its interior ; the femoral vessels which lie in front of the fascia remain intact, and the peritoneum seldom becomes implicated. All Psoas abscesses do not, however, pursue this course : the matter may leave the muscle above the crest of the ilium, and tracking back- wards may point in the loin {lumbar abscess); or it may point above Poupart's ligament in the inguinal region ; or it may follow the course of the iliac vessels into the pelvis, and, passing through the great sacro-sciatic notch, discharge itself on the back of the thigh ; or it may open into the bladder, or find its way into the perinaeum. Dissection.—To expose the muscles and fasciae in this region, make an incision along Poupart's ligament, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the os pubis ; a vertical incision from the centre of this, along the middle of the thigh to below the knee- joint ; and a transverse incision from the inner to the outer side of the leg, at the lower end of the vertical incision. The flaps of integument having been removed, the superficial and deep fasciae should be examined. The more advanced student should commence the study of this region by an examination of the anatomy of femoral hernia, and Scarpa's triangle, the incisions for the dissection of which are marked out in the opposite figure. The superficial fascia forms a continuous layer over the whole of the thigh, consisting of areolar tissue, containing in its meshes much fat, and capable of being separated into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves. It varies in thickness in different parts of the limb; in the groin it is thick, and the two layers are separated from one another by the super- ficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the internal saphenous vein, and several smaller vessels. One of these two layers, the superficial, is continuous above with the superficial fascia of the abdomen. The deep layer of the superficial fascia is a very thin, fibrous layer, best marked on the inner side of the long saphenous vein and below Poupart's ligament. It is placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves and upon the surface of the fascia lata. It is intimately adherent to the fascia lata a little below Poupart's ligament. It covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, being closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels, corresponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein and by Anterior Femoral Eegion Tensor vaginae femoris. Sartorius. Eectus. Vastus externus. Vastus internus.

Fascia of the ThighOF THE THIGH 485 numerous blood and lymphatic vessels, hence it has been termed, the cribriform fascia, the openings for these vessels having been likened to the holes in a sieve. The cribriform fascia adheres closely both to the superficial fascia and to the fascia lata, so that it is described by some anatomists as part of the fascia lata, but is usually considered (as in this work) as belonging to the superficial fascia. It is not until the cribriform fascia has been cleared away that the saphenous opening is seen, so that this opening does not in ordinary cases exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. Mr. Callender, however, speaks of cases in which, probably as the result of pressure from enlarged inguinal lymphatic glands, the fascia has become atrophied, and a saphenous opening exists independent of dissection. A femoral hernia in passing through the saphenous opening receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. A large subcutaneous bursa is found in the superficial fascia over the patella. The deep fascia of the thigh is exposed on the removal of the superficial fascia, and is named, from its great extent, the fascia lata ; it forms a uniform investment for the whole of this region of the limb, but varies in thickness in different parts; thus, it is thicker in the upper and outer part of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the Gluteus maximus muscle, and the Tensor vaginae femoris is inserted between its layers : it is very thin behind, and at the upper and inner part where it covers the Adductor muscles, and again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving- fibrous expansions from the tendon of the Biceps externally, and from the Sartorius internally, and Quadriceps extensor cruris m front. The fascia lata is attached, above and behind, to the back of the sacrum and coccyx ; externally, to the crest of the ilium ; in front, to Poupart's ligament, and to the body of the os pubis ; and internally, to the descending ramus of the os pubis, to the ascending ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and to the lower border of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. From its attach- ment to the crest of the ilium it passes down over the Gluteus medius muscle to the upper border of the Gluteus maximus, where it splits into two layers, one passing superficial to and the other beneath this muscle. At the lower border of the muscle the two layers unite. Externally, just below the great trochanter, the fascia lata receives the greater part of the tendon of insertion of the Gluteus maximus, and becomes proportionately thickened. The portion of the fascia lata arising from the front part of the crest of the ilium, corre- sponding to the origin of the Tensor vaginae femoris, passes down the outer side of the thigh as two layers, one superficial and the other beneath this muscle ; these at its lower end become blended together into a thick and strong band, having first received the insertion of the muscle. This band is continued downwards, under the name of the ilio-tihial hand, to be inserted into the external tuberosity of the tibia. Below, the fascia lata is attached to all the prominent points around the knee-joint ; viz. the condyles of the Fig. 325.—Dissection of lower extremity. Front view,MUSCLES AND FASCIA 486 Fig. 326.—Muscles of the iliac and anterior femoral regions. femur, tuberosities of the tibia, and head of the fibula. On each side of the patella it is strengthened by transverse fibres given off from the lower part of the Vasti muscles, which are attached to and support this bone. Of these the outer is the stronger, and is continuous with the ilio-tibial band. From the inner surface of the fascia lata are given off two strong inter- muscular septa, which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below : the external and stronger one, which extends from the insertion of the Gluteus maxi- mus to the outer condyle, separates the Vastus externus in front from the short head of the Biceps behind, and gives partial origin to these muscles ; the inner one, the thinner of the two, separates the Vastus internus from the Adductor and Pectineus muscles. Besides these there are numerous smaller septa, separating the individual muscles, and enclosing each in a distinct sheath. At the upper and inner part of the thigh, a little below Poupart's ligament, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed after the superficial fascia has been cleared off : it transmits the internal saphenous vein, and other smaller vessels, and is termed . the saphenous oijen ing. In order more correctly to consider the mode of forma- tion of this aperture, the fascia lata in this part of the thigh is described as consisting of two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac 'portion is all that part of the fascia lata on the outer side of the saphenous opening. It is attached, ex- ternally, to the crest of the ilium and its anterior superior spine, to the whole length of Poupart's ligament as far in- ternally as the spine of the os pubis, and to the pectineal line in conjunction with Gimbernat's ligament. From the spine of the OS pubis it is reflected downwards and outwards, forming an arched margin, the boundary or falciform process {su- perior cornii) of the saphenous opening ; this margin overlies and is adherent to the anterior layer of the sheath of the femoral vessels : to its edge is attached the cribriform fascia; and, below, it is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The pubic portion is situated at the inner side of the saphenous opening; at487 ANTEEIOR FEMORAL REGION the lower margin of this aperture it is continuous with the ihac portion ; traced upwards, it covers the surface of the Pectineus, Adductor longus, and GraciUs muscles, and, passing behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, to which it is closely united, is continuous with the sheath of the Psoas and Iliacus muscles, and is attached above to the ilio-pectineal line, where it becomes continuous with the iliac fascia. From this description it may be observed that the iliac portion of the fascia lata passes in front of the femoral vessels, and the pubic portion behind them, so that an apparent aperture exists between the two, through which the internal saphenous joins the femoral vein.* The fascia should now be removed from the surface of the muscles. This may be " effected by pinching it up between the forceps, dividing it, and separating it from each muscle in the coiu-se of its fibres. The Tensor vaginae femoris arises from the anterior part of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the outer surface of the anterior superior spinous process, between the Gluteus medius and Sartorius. It is inserted into the fascia lata about one-fourth down the outer side of the thigh. From the point of insertion the fascia is continued downwards to the head of the tibia as a thickened band, the ilio-tibial band. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia lata and the integument. By its deep surface, with the Gluteus medius. Rectus femoris. Vastus externus, and the ascending branches of the external circumflex artery. By its anterior border, with the Sartorius, from which it is separated below by a triangular space, in which is seen the Rectus femoris. By its posterior border, with the Gluteus medius. The Sartorius, the longest muscle in the body, is flat, narrow, and ribbon-like : it arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the upper half of the notch below it, passes obliquely across the upper and anterior part of the thigh, from the outer to the inner side of the limb, then descends vertically, as far as the inner side of the knee, passing behind the inner condyle of the femur, and terminates in a tendon, which, curving obliquely forwards, expands into a broad aponeurosis, inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, nearly as far forwards as the crest. This expansion is inserted into the bone by an inverted U-shaped aponeurosis ; part of it is inserted behind the attachment of the Gracilis and Semitendinosus, and another part, arching over the upper border of the tendon of the Gracilis, is inserted into the tibia in front of these muscles. An offset is derived from the upper margin of this aponeurosis, which blends with the fibrous capsule of the knee-joint, and another, given off from its lower border, blends with the fascia on the inner side of the leg. The relations of this muscle to the femoral artery should be carefully examined, as it constitutes the chief guide in tying the artery. In the upper third of the thigh it forms the outer side of a triangular space, Scarpa's triangle, the inner side of which is formed by the Adductor longus, and the base, turned upwards, by Poupart's ligament; the femoral artery passes perpendicularly through the middle of this space from its base to its apex. In the middle third of the thigh, the femoral artery lies first along the inner border, and then behind the Sartorius. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia lata and integument.

It is the great Extensor muscle of the leg, forming a large fleshy mass, which covers the front and sides of the femur, being united below into a * These parts will be again more particularly described with the anatomy of Hernia.488 MUSCLES AND FASCIA single tendon, attached to the patella, and above, subdivided into separate portions, which have received distinct names. Of these, one occupying the middle of the thigh, connected above Avith the ilium, is called the Bectus feiiioris, from its straight course. The other divisions lie in immediate connection with the shaft of the femur, which they cover from the trochanters to the condyles. The portion on the outer side of the femur is termed the Vastus externus; that covering the inner side, the Vastus interims ; and that covering the front of the femur, the Crureus. The two latter portions are, however, so intimately blended as to form but one muscle. The Rectus femoris is situated in the middle of the anterior region of the thigh ; it is fusiform in shape, and its superficial fibres are arranged in a bipenni- form manner, the deep fibres running straight down to the deep aponeurosis. It arises by two tendons : one, the straight tendon, or short head, from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium ; the other is flattened, and curves outwards, to be attached to a groove above the brim of the acetabulum ; this is the reflected tendon, or long head, of the Rectus ; it unites with the straight tendon at an acute angle, and then spreads into an aponeurosis, from which the muscular fibres arise.* The muscle terminates in a broad and thick aponeurosis, which occupies the lower two-thirds of its posterior surface, and, gradually becoming- narrowed into a flattened tendon, is inserted into the patella in common with the Vasti and Crureus. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the anterior fibres of the Gluteus minimus, the Tensor vaginae femoris, the Sartorius, and the Psoas and Iliacus ; by its lower three-fourths, with the fascia lata. By its posterior surface, with the hip-joint, the external circumflex vessels, and the Crureus and Vasti muscles. The three remaining muscles have been described collectively by some anatomists, separate from the Rectus, under the name of the Triceps extensor cruris. The Vastus externus is the largest part of the Quadriceps extensor. It arises by a broad aponeurosis, which is attached to the tubercle of the femur, to the anterior and inferior borders of the great trochanter, to a rough line leading from the trochanter major to the linea aspera, and to the outer lip of the linea aspera : this aponeurosis covers the upper three-fourths of the muscle, and from its inner surface many fibres arise. A few additional fibres arise from the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, and from the external intermuscular septum between the Vastus externus and short head of the Biceps. The fibres form a large fleshy mass, which is attached to a strong aponeurosis, placed on the under surface of the muscle it its lower part: this becomes contracted and thickened into a flat tendon, which as inserted into the outer border of the patella, blending with the great extensor tendon. Relations.—By its stiperficial surface, with the Rectus, the Tensor vaginae femoris, the fascia lata, and the Gluteus maximus, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa. By its deep surface, with the Crureus, some large branches of the external circumflex artery and anterior crural nerve being interposed. The Vastus internus and Crureus are so inseparably connected together as to form but one muscle, as which it will be accordingly described. It is the smallest portion of the Quadriceps extensor. The anterior portion of it, covered by the Rectus, is called the Crureus; the internal portion, which lies immediately beneath the fascia lata, the Vastus internus. It arises by an aponeurosis, which is attached to the lower part of the line that extends from the inner side of the neck of the femur to the linea aspera, from the inner lip of the linea aspera, from the ridge leading from the linea aspera to the internal condyle and internal * Mr. W. R. Williams, in an interesting paper m the Journ. of Anat, and Phys. vol. xiii. p. 204, points out that the reflected tendon is the real origin of the muscle, and is alone present in early fcetal life. The direct tendon is merely an accessory band of condensed fascia. The paper wiU well repay perusal, though in some particulars I think the description in the text more generally accurate.—Ed.489 ANTERIOR FEMORAL REGION intermuscular septum. It also arises from nearly the whole of the internal, anterior, and external surfaces of the shaft of the femur, limited, above, by the line between the two trochanters, and extending, below, to Avithin the lower fourth of the bone. From these different origins, the fibres converge to a broad aponeurosis, which covers the anterior surface of the middle portion of the muscle (the Crureus), and the deep surface of tlie inner division of the muscle (the Vastus internus), and which gradually narrows down to its insertion into the patella, where it blends with the other portions of the Quadriceps extensor. The muscular fibres of the Vastus internus extend lower down than those of the Vastus externus, so that the capsule of - the joint is less covered with muscular fibres on the outer than on the inner side. Relations.—By its su/perficial siirface, with the Psoas and Iliacus, the Rectus, Sartorius, Pectineus, Adductors, and fascia lata, femoral vessels, and saphenous nerve. By its deep surface, with the femur, Subcrureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. The student will observe the striking analogy that exists between the Quadri- ceps extensor and the Triceps muscle in the upper extremity. So close is this similarity, that M. Cruveilhier has described it under the name of the Triceps femoralis. Like the Triceps extensor cubiti, it consists of three distinct divisions, or heads : a middle or long head, the Rectus, analogous to the long head of the Triceps, attached to the ilium, and two other portions, which may be called the external and internal heads of the Triceps femoralis. These, it will be noticed, are strictly analogous to the outer and inner heads of the Triceps in the arm. The tendons of the different portions of the Quadriceps extensor unite at the lower part of the thigh, so as to form a single strong tendon, which is inserted into the upper part of the patella. More properly, the patella may be regarded as a sesamoid bone, developed in the tendon of the Quadriceps ; and the ligamentum patellae, which is continued from the lower part of the patella to the tuberosity of the tibia, as the proper tendon of insertion of the muscle. A synovial bursa, the post-patellar bursa, is interposed between the tendon and the upper part of the tuberosity of the tibia; and another, the prepatellar bursa, is placed over the patella itself. This latter bursa often becomes enlarged, constituting ' house- maid's knee.' The Subcrureus is a small muscle, usually distinct from the Crureus, but occa- sionally blended with it, which arises from the anterior surface of the lower part of the shaft of the femur, and is inserted into the upper part of the cul-de-sac of the capsular ligament which projects upwards beneath the Quadriceps for a variable distance. It sometimes consists of two separate muscular bundles. Nerves.—The Tensor vaginae femoris is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve ; the other muscles of this region, by branches from the anterior crural. Actions.—The Tensor vaginge femoris is a tensor of the fascia lata ; continuing its action, the oblique direction of its fibres enables it to abduct and to rotate the thigh inwards. In the erect posture, acting from below, it will serve to steady the pelvis upon the head of the femur; and by means of the ilio-tibial band it steadies the condyles of the femur on the articular surfaces of the tibia, and assists the Gluteus maximus in supporting the knee in the extended position. The Sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, and, continuing to act, flexes the thigh upon the pelvis ; it next rotates the thigh outwards. It was formerly supposed to adduct the thigh, so as to cross one leg over the other, and hence received its name of Sartorius, or tailor's muscle (sartor, a tailor), because it was supposed to assist in crossing the legs in the squatting position. When the knee is bent, the Sartorius assists the Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus, and Popliteus in rotating the tibia inwards. Taking its fixed point from the leg, it flexes the pelvis upon the thigh, and, if one muscle acts, assists in rotating the pelvis. The Quadriceps extensor extends the leg upon the thigh. Taking its fixed pomt from the leg, as in standing, this muscle will act upon the femur, supporting it perpendicularly upon the head of the tibia, and thus maintaining the entire weight of the body, or, in the stooping position, itMUSCLES AND FASCI.E 49° will straighten the knee, and therefore assist the trunk in rising into the erect position. The Rectus muscle assists the Psoas and lUacus in supporting the pelvis and trunk upon the femur, or in bending it forwards. Surgical Anaiomy.—A few fibres of the Eectns muscle are liable to be ruptured from severe strain. This accident is especially liable to occur during the games of football and cricket, and is sometimes known as ' cricket thigh.' The patient experiences a sudden pain in the part, as if he had been struck, and the Rectus muscle stands out and is felt to be tense and rigid. The accident is often followed by considerable swellini,^ from inflannnatory effusion. Occasionally the Quadriceps extensor may be torn away from its insertion into the patella ; or the tendon of the patella may be ruptured about an inch above the bone. This accident is caused in the same manner as fracture of the patella by muscular action is produced, viz. by a violent muscular effort to prevent f\illing whilst the knee is in a position of semiflexion. A distinct gap can be felt above the patella, and, owing to the retraction of the muscular fibres, union may fail to take place. Inteenal Femoral Region Gracilis. Adductor longns. Pectineus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. Dissection.—These muscles are at once exposed by removing the fascia from the fore part and inner side of the thigh. The limb should be abducted, so as to render the muscles tense and easier of dissection. The Gracilis (figs. 326, 329) is the most superficial muscle on the inner side of the thigh. It is thin and flattened, broad above, narrow and tapering below. It arises by a thin aponeurosis between two and three inches in breadth, from the lower half of the margin of the symphysis and the inner margin of the descending ramus of the os pubis. The fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a rounded tendon, which passes behind the internal condyle of the femur, and, curving round the inner tuberosity of the tibia, becomes flattened, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, below the tuberosity. The tendon of this muscle is situated immediately above that of the Semitendinosus, and is surrounded by the tendon of the Sartorius with which it is in part blended. As it passes across the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, it is separated from it by a synovial bursa common to it and the Semitendinosus mjiscle. Relations.—By its superficial surface, Avith the fascia lata and the Sartorius below ; the internal saphenous vein crosses it obliquely near its lower part, lying superficial to the fascia lata. The internal saphenous nerve emerges between its tendon and that of the Sartorius. By its deep surface, with the Adductor brevis and the Adductor magnus, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. The Pectineus (fig. 326) is a flat, quadrangular muscle, situated at the anterior part of the upper and inner aspect of the thigh. It arises from the linea ilio- pectinea, from the surface of bone in front of it, between the pectineal eminence and spine of the os pubis, and from the fascia covering the anterior surface of the muscle ; the fibres pass dowmvards, backwards, and outwards, to be inserted into a rough line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the pubic portion of the fascia lata, w^hicli separates it from the femoral vessels and internal saphenous vein. By its posterior surface, with the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, the Adductor brevis and Obturator externus muscles, the obturator vessels and nerve being interposed. By its outer border, with the Psoas, a cellular interval separating them, through which passes the internal circumflex vessels. By its inner border, with the margin of the Adductor longus. The Adductor longus, the most superficial of the three Adductors, is a flat triangular muscle, lying on the same plane as the Pectineus. It arises, by a flat narrow tendon, from the front of the os pubis, at the angle of junction of the crest with the symphysis ; and soon expands into a broad fleshy belly, which, passing491 INTEENAL FEMORAL REGION 327.—Deep muscles of the internal femoral re£jion. downwards, backwards, and outwards, is inserted, by an aponeurosis, into the linea aspera, betAveen the Vastus internus and the Adductor magnus, with which it is usually blended. Relations.—By its anterior surface, FiCx. with the fascia lata, the Sartorius, and, near its insertion, with the femoral artery and vein. By its posterior surface, with the Adductor brevis and magnus, the an- terior branches of the obturator nerve, and with the profunda artery and vein near its insertion. By its outer border, with the Pectineus. By its Limer border, with the Gracilis. The Pectineus and Adductor longns should now be divided near their origin, and turned downwards, when the Adductor brevis and Obturator externus will be exposed. The Adductor brevis is situated im- mediately behind the two preceding muscles. It is somewhat triangular in form, and arises by a narrow origin from the outer surface of the body and descend- ing ramus of the os pubis, between the Gracilis and Obturator externus. Its fibres, passing backwards, outwards, and downwards, are inserted, by an aponeu- rosis, into the lower part of the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera and the upper part of the linea aspera, immediately behind the Pectineus and upper part of the Adductor longus. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Pectineus, Adductor longus, pro- funda femoris artery, and anterior branches of the obturator nerve. By its 2)osterior surface, with the x\dductor magnus, and posterior branch of the obturator nerve. By its outer border, with the Obturator externus, and conjoined tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus. By its inner, border, with the Gracilis and x\dductor magnus. This muscle is pierced, near its insertion, by the middle perforating branch of the profunda femoris artery. The Adductor brevis should now be cut away near its origin, and turned outwards, when the entire extent of the Adductor magnus will be exposed. The Adductor magnas is a large tri- angular muscle, forming a septum between the muscles on the inner and those on the back of the thigh. It arises from a small part of the descending ramus of the OS pubis, from the ascending ramus of the ischium, and from the outer margin and under surface of the tuberositv of the ischium. Those fibres which arise from492 MUSCLES AND FASCI.E the ramus of the os pubis are very short, horizontal in direction, and are inserted into the rough line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, internal to the Gluteus maximus ; those from the ramus of the ischium are directed down- wards and outwards with difierent degrees of obUquity, to be inserted, by means of a broad aponeurosis, into the linea aspera and the iippei' part of its internal pro- longation below. The internal portion of the muscle, consisting principally of those fibres which arise from the tuberosity of the ischium, forms a thick fleshy mass consisting of coarse bundles which descend almost vertically, and terminate about the lower third of the thigh in a rounded tendon, which is inserted into the Adductor tubercle on the inner condyle of the femur, being connected by a fibrous expansion to the line leading upwards from the tubercle to the linea aspera. Between the two portions of the muscle an interval is left, tendinous in front, fleshy behind, for the passage of the femoral vessels into the popliteal space. The external portion of the muscle at its attachment to the femur presents three or four osseo-aponeurotic openings, formed by tendinous arches attached to the bone, from which muscular fibres arise. The three superior of these apertures are for the three perforating arteries, and the fourth, when it exists, for the terminal branch of the profunda. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Pectineus, Adductor brevis, Adductor longus, and the femoral and profunda vessels and obturator nerve. By its i)osterior surface, with the great sciatic nerve, the Gluteus maximus. Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus. By its superior or sJiortest border, it lies parallel with the Quadratus femoris, the internal circumflex artery passing between them. By its internal or longest border, with the Gracilis, Sartorius, and fascia lata. By its external or attached border, it is inserted into the femur behind the Adductor brevis and Adductor longus, which separate it from the Vastus internus ; and in front of the Gluteus maximus and short head of the Biceps, which separate it from the Vastus externus. Nerves.—All the muscles of this group are supplied by the obturator nerve. The Pectineus receives additional branches from the accessory obturator and anterior crural; and the Adductor magnus an additional branch from the great sciatic. Actions.—The Pectineus and three iVdductors adduct the thigh powerfully; they are especially used in horse exercise, the flanks of the horse being grasped between the knees by the actions of these muscles. In consequence of the obliquity of their insertion into the linea aspera, they rotate the thigh outwards, assisting the external Rotators, and when the limb has been abducted, they draw it inwards, carrying the thigh across that of the opposite side. The Pectineus and Adductor brevis and longus assist the Psoas and Iliacus in flexing the thigh upon the pelvis. In progression, also, all these muscles assist in drawing forwards the hinder limb. The Gracilis assists the Sartorius in flexing the leg and rotating it inwards ; it is also an adductor of the thigh. If the lower extremities are fixed, these muscles may take their fixed point from below and act upon the pelvis, serving to maintain the body in an erect posture ; or, if their action is continued, to flex the pelvis forwards upon the femur. Siirr/ical A)icdomj/.—The Adductor longus is liable to be severely strained in those who ride much on horseback, or its tendon to be ruptured by suddenly gripping the saddle.

Dissection of gluteal region Dissection (fif^. 328).—The subject should be turned on its face, a block placed beneath the pelvis to make the biittocks tense, and the limbs allowed to han<>- over the end of the table, with the foot inverted, and the thigh abducted. Make an incision through the integument along the crest of the ilium to the middle of the sacnun and thence downwards to the tip of the qoqc\\, and carry a second incision from that point oblicpiely downwards and outwards to the outer side of the thigh, four inches below the great trochanter. The portion of integument included between these incisions is to be removed in the direction shown in the figure. The Gluteus maximus (fig. 329), the most superficial muscle in the gluteal region, is a very broad and thick fleshy mass, of a quadrilateral shape, which forms the prominence of the nates. Its large size is one of the most characteristic points in the muscular system in man, connected as it is with the power he has of maintaining the trunk in the erect posture. In structure the muscle is remarkably coarse, being made up of muscular fasciculi lying parallel with one another, and collected together into large bundles, separated by deep cellular intervals. It arises from the superior curved line of the ilium, and the portion of bone, including the crest, immediately behind it; from the posterior surface of the lower part of the sacrum, the side of the coccyx, the aponeu- rosis of the Erector spin^e muscle, and the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The fibres are directed obliquely downwards and outwards ; those forming the upper and larger portion of the muscle (after converging somewhat) terminate in a thick tendinous lamina, which passes across the great trochanter, and is inserted into the fascia lata covering the outer side of the thigh, the lower portion of the muscle being inserted into the rough line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera bet-ween the Vastus ex- ternus and Adductor magnus. Three synovial bitrscs are usually found in relation with this muscle. One of these, of large size, and generally multilocular, separates it from the great trochanter. A second, often wanting, is situated on the tuberosity of the ischium. A third is found between the tendon of this muscle and the Vastus externus. Relations.—By its superficicd surface, with a thin fascia, Avhich separates it from the subcutaneous tissue.

The upper portion of the muscle is to be altogether de- tached, and the lower portion turned outwards ; the loose are- olar tissue tiUing up the inter- space between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium being removed, the parts already enumerated as exposed by the removal of this muscle will be seen. The Gluteus medius is a broad, thick, radiated muscle, situated on the outer surface of the pelvis. Its posterior third is covered by the Glu- teus maximus; its anterior two-thirds by the fascia lata, which separates it from the integument. It arises from the outer surface of the ilium, between the superior and middle curved lines, and from the outer lip of that portion of the crest which is between them ; it also arises from the dense fascia (Gluteal aponeu- rosis) covering its outer sur- face. The fibres converge to a strong flattened tendon, which is inserted into the oblique line which traverses the outer surface of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa separates the tendon of the muscle from the surface of the trochanter in front of its insertion. Belations.—By its super- ficial mrface,'wiih. the Gluteus maximus behind, the Tensor vaginae femoris • and deep fascia in front. By its deep surface, with the Gluteus minimus and the gluteal ves- sels and superior gluteal nerve. Its anterior border is blended wdth the Gluteus minimus. Its posterior border lies parallel with the Pyriformis, the glu- teal vessels intervening. This muscle should now be divided near its insertion and turned upwards, when the Glu- teus minimus will be exposed. The Gluteus minimus, the smallest of the three Glutei,GLUTEAL REGION 495 is placed immediately beneath the preceding. It is fan-shaped, arising from the outer sm'face of the ilium, between the middle and inferior curved lines, and behind, from the margin of the great sacro-sciatic notch: the fibres converge to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, which, terminating in a tendon, is inserted into an impression on the anterior border of the great trochanter. A synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon and the great trochanter. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Gluteus medius, and the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. By its deep surface, with the ilium, the reflected tendon of the Rectus femoris, and capsular ligament of the hip-joint. Its anterior margin is blended with the Gluteus medius. Its posterior margin is often joined with the tendon of the Pyriformis. The Pyriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape, lying almost parallel with the posterior margin of the Gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis at its posterior part, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. It arises from the front of the sacrum by three fleshy digitations, attached to the portions of bone between the first, second, third, and fourth anterior sacral foramina, and also from the grooves leading from the foramina : a few fibres also arise from the margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the great sacro- sciatic ligament. The muscle passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro- sciatic foramen, the upper part of which it fills, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the upper border of the great trochanter, behind, but often blended with, the tendon of the Obturator internus and Gemelli muscles. Relations.—By its anterior surface, within tlie pelvis, with the Rectum (espe- cially on the left side), the sacral plexus of nerves, and the branches of the internal iliac vessels ; external to the pelvis, with the os innominatum and capsular liga- ment of the hip-joint. By its posterior surface, within tiie pelvis, with the sacrum ; and external. to it, with the Gluteus maximus. By its upper border, with the Gluteus medius, from which it is separated by the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve. By its loiuer border, with the Gemellus superior and Coccygeus ; the sciatic vessels and nerves, the internal pudic vessels and nerve, and muscular branches from the sacral plexus, passing from the pelvis in the interval between the two muscles. The Obturator membrane is a thin layer of interlacing fibres, which closes the obturator foramen. It is attached, externally, to the margin of the foramen ; internally, to the posterior surface of the ischio-pubic ramus, internal to the inner margin of the foramen. It is occasionally incomplete, and presents at its upper and outer part a small canal, which is bounded below by a thickened band of fibres, for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. Each Obturator muscle is connected with this membrane. Dissection.—The next muscle, as well as the origin of the Pyriformis, can only be seen when the pelvis is divided and the viscera removed. The Obturator internus, like the preceding muscle, is situated partly within the cavity of the pelvis, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. It arises from the inner surface of the anterior and external wall of the pelvis, around the inner side of the obturator foramen, being attached to the descending ramus of the os pubis and the ascending ramus of the ischium, and at the side to the inner surface of the body of the ischium, between the margin of the obturator foramen in front, and the great sacro-sciatic notch behind, and to the inner surface of the ilium below the brim of the true pelvis. It also arises from the inner surface of the obturator membrane except at its lower part, and from the tendinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve. The fibres are directed backwards and downwards, and terminate in four or five tendinous bands, which are found on its deep surface ; these bands are reflected at a right angle over the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, which is grooved for their reception : the groove is covered with cartilage, and lined with a synovial bursa. The muscle leaves the pelvis by the lesser sacro-sciatic notch ; and the tendinous bands unite into a single flattened tendon, which passes horizontally496 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE outwards, and, after receiving the attachment of the Gemeni, is inserted into the inner surface of the great trochanter in front of the Obturator externus. A synovial bursa, narrow and elongated in form, is usually found between the tendon of this muscle and the capsular ligament of the hip : it occasionally communicates with the bursa between the tendon and the tuberosity of the ischium, the two forming a single sac. In order to display the peculiar appearances presented by the tendon of this muscle, it must be divided near its insertion and reflected outwards. Relations.—Within the pelvis, this muscle is in relation, by its anterior surface, with the obturator membrane and inner surface of the anterior wall of the pelvis ; by its posterior surface, with the pelvic and obturator fasciae, which separate it from the Levator ani ; and it is crossed by the internal pudic vessels and nerve. This surface forms the outer boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa. External to the pelvis, it is covered by the great sciatic nerve and Gluteus maximus, and rests on the back part of the hip-joint. The Gemelli are two small muscular fasciculi, accessories to the tendon of the Obturator internus, which is received into a groove between them. They are called superior and inferior. The Gemellus sup rior, the smaller of the two, arises from the outer surface of the spine of the ischium, and passing horizontally outwards becomes blended with the upper part of the tendon of the Obturator internus, and is inserted with it into the inner surface of the great trochanter. This muscle is sometimes wanting. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Gluteus maximus and the sciatic vessels and nerves. By its deep surface, with the capsule of the hip-joint. By its upper border, with the lower margin of the Pyriformis. By its loioer border, with the tendon of the Obturator internus. The G-emellus inferior arises from the upper part of the tuberosity of the ischium, where it forms the lower edge of the groove for the Obturator internus tendon, and, passing horizontally outwards, is blended with the lower part of the tendon of the Obturator internus, and inserted with it into the inner surface of the great trochanter. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Gluteus maximus and the sciatic vessels and nerves. By its deep surface, with the capsular ligament oi the hip-joint. By its upper border, with the tendon of the Obturator internus. By its loioer border, with the tendon of the Obturator externus and Quadratus femoris. The duadratus femoris is a short, fiat muscle, quadrilateral in shape (hence its name), situated between the Gemellus inferior and the upper margin of the Adductor magnus. It arises from the external lip of the tuberosity of the ischium, and, proceeding horizontally outwards, is inserted into the upper part of the linea quadrata, that is, the line which crosses the posterior intertrochanteric line. A synovial bursa is often found between the under surface of this muscle and the lesser trochanter, which it covers. Relations.—By its posterior surface, with the Gluteus maximus and the sciatic vessels and nerves. By its anterior surface, with the tendon of the Obturator externus and trochanter minor, and with the capsule of the hip-joint. By its upper border, with the Gemellus inferior. Its lower border is separated from the Adductor magnus by the terminal branches of the internal circumflex vessels. Dissection.—In order to expose the next muscle (the Obturator externus), it is necessary to remove the Psoas, Iliacus, Pectineus, and Adductor brevis and longus muscles from the front and inner side of the thigh ; and the Gluteus maximus and Quadratus femoris from the back part. Its dissection should, consequently, be postponed until the muscles of the anterior and internal femoral regions have been examined. The Obturator externus (fig. 327) is a flat, triangular muscle, which covers the outer surface of the anterior waU of the pelvis. It arises from the margin of bonePOSTEEIOE FEMORAL REGION 497 immediately around the inner side of the obturator foramen, viz. from the body and ramus of the os pubis, and the ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the inner two-thirds of the outer surface of the obturator membrane, and from the tendinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves. The fibres converging pass backwards, outwards, and upwards, and terminate in a tendon which runs across the back part of the hip-joint, and is inserted into the digital fossa of the feiiiur. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the Psoas, Iliacus, Pectineus, Adductor magnus. Adductor brevis, and Gracilis ; and more externally, with the neck of the femur and capsule of the hip-joint. By its posterior surface, with the obturator membrane and Quadratus femoris. Nerves.—The Gluteus maximus is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve from the sacral plexus ; the Gluteus medius and minimus, by the superior gluteal; the Pyriformis, Gemelli, Obturator internus, and Quadratus femoris, by branches from the sacral plexus ; and the Obturator externus, by the obturator nerve. Actions.—The Gluteus maximus, when it takes its fixed point from the pelvis, extends the femur and brings the bent thigh into a line with the body. Taking its fixed point from below, it acts upon the pelvis, supporting it and the whole trunk upon the head of the femur, which is especially obvious in standing on one leg. Its most powerful action is to cause the body to regain the erect position after stooping, by drawing the pelvis backwards, being assisted in this action by the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus. The Gluteus maximus is a tensor of the fascia lata, and by its connection with the ilio-tibial band it steadies the femur on the articular surface of the tibia during standing, when the extensor muscles are relaxed. The lower part of the muscle also acts as an abductor and external rotator of the limb. The Gluteus medius and minimus abduct the thigh, when the limb is extended, and are principally called into action in supporting the body on one limb, in conjunction with the Tensor vaginae femoris. Their anterior fibres, by drawing the great trochanter forwards, rotate the thigh inwards, in which action they are also assisted by the Tensor vaginae femoris. The remaining muscles are powerful rotators of the thigh outwards. In the sitting posture, when the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis, their action as rotators ceases, and they become abductors, with the exception of the Obturator externus, which still rotates the femur outwards. When the femur is fixed, the Pyriformis and Obturator muscles serve to draw the pelvis forwards if it has been inclined back- wards, and assist in steadying it upon the head of the femur. POSTEEIOR FeMOEAL ReGION Biceps. Semitendinosus. Semimembranosus. Dissection (fig. 328).—Make a vertical incision along the middle of the thigh, from the lower fold of the nates to about three inches below the back of the knee-joint, and there connect it with a transverse incision, carried from the inner to the outer side of the leg. Make a third incision transversely at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh. The integument having been removed from the back of the knee, and the boundaries of the popliteal space examined, the removal of the integument from the remaining part of the thigh should be continued, when the fascia and muscles of this region will be exposed. The Biceps (jBz'ceps/Ze;3;or cruris) is a large muscle, of considerable length, situated on the posterior and outer aspect of the thigh (fig. 329). It arises by two heads. One, the long head, arises from the lower and inner facet on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the Semitendinosus. The femoral, or short head, arises from the outer lip of the linea aspera, between the Adductor magnus and Vastus externus, extending up almost as high as the insertion of the Gluteus maximus, and from its outer prolongation below to within two inches of the outer condyle ; it also arises from the external intermuscular septum. The fibres of the long head* form a fusiform belly, which, passing obliquely downwards and a little outwards, terminates in an aponeurosis which covers the posterior K KMUSCLES AND FASCIiE 498 surface of the muscle, and receives the fibres of the short head : this aponeurosis becomes gradually contracted into a tendon, which is inserted into the outer side of the head of the fibula, and by a small slip into the lateral surface of the external tuberosity of the tibia. At its insertion the tendon divides into two portions, which embrace the long external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, a strong prolongation being sent forwards to the outer tuberosity of the tibia, which gives off an expansion to the fascia of the leg. The tendon of this muscle forms the outer hamstring. Relations.—By its sui)erfi,cial surface, with the Gluteus maximus above, with the fascia lata and integument in the rest of its extent. By its deeiJ surface, with the Semimembranosus, Adductor magnus, and Vastus externus, the great sciatic nerve, and, near its insertion, with the external head of the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, the superior external articular artery, and the external popliteal nerve. The Semitendinosiis, remarkable for the great length of its tendon, is situated at the posterior and inner aspect of the thigh. It arises from the lower and inner facet on the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the Biceps ; it also arises from an aponeurosis which connects the adjacent surfaces of the two muscles to the extent of about three inches after their origin. It forms a fusiform muscle, which, passing downwards and inwards, terminates a little below the middle of the thigh in a long round tendon which lies along the inner side of the popliteal space, then curves around the inner tuberosity of the tibia, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of that bone, nearly as far forwards as its anterior border. This tendon is surrounded by the tendon of the Sartorius, and lies below that of the Gracilis, to which it is united. A tendinous intersection is usually observed about the middle of the muscle. Relations.—By its sui)erficial surface, with the Gluteus maximus and fascia lata. By its deei) surface, with the Semimembranosus, Adductor magnus, inner head of the Gastrocnemius, and internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. The Semimembranosus, so called from the membranous expansion on its anterior and posterior surfaces, is situated at the back part and inner side of the thigh. It arises by a thick tendon from the upper and outer facet on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, above and to the outer side of the Biceps and Semitendinosus, and is inserted into the groove on the inner and back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia, beneath the internal lateral ligament. The tendon of the muscle at its origin expands into an aponeurosis, which covers the upper part of its anterior surface: from this aponeurosis muscular fibres arise, and converge to another aponeurosis which covers the lower part of its posterior surface and contracts into the tendon of insertion. The tendon of the muscle at its insertion gives oft' two fibrous expansions; one of these, of considerable size, passes upAvards and outwards to be inserted into the back part of the outer condyle of the femur, forming part of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The second is continued downwards to the fascia which covers the Popliteus muscle. The tendon also sends a few fibres to join the internal lateral ligament of the joint. The tendons of the two preceding muscles, with that of the Gracilis, form the inner hamstring. Relations.—By its sui^erficial surface, with the Semitendinosus, Biceps, and fascia lata. By its deey surface, with the popliteal vessels. Adductor magnus, and inner head of the Gastrocnemius, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa. By its inner border, with the Gracilis. By its outer border, with the great sciatic nerve, and its internal popliteal branch. Nerves.—The muscles of this region are supplied by the great sciatic nerve. Actions.—The hamstring muscles flex the leg upon the thigh. When the knee is semi-fiexed, the Biceps, in consequence of its oblique direction downwards and outwards, rotates the leg slightly outwards; and the Semitendinosus, and to a slight extent the Semimembranosus, rotate the leg inwards, assisting the Popliteus.OF THE LEG 499 Taking their fixed point from below, these muscles serve to support the pelvis upon the head of the femur, and to draw the trunk directly backwards, as in feats of strength, when the body is thrown backwards in the form of an arch. Surgical Anatomy.—The tendons of these mus- cles occasionally require subcutaneous division in some forms of spurious ankylosis of the knee-joint de- pendent upon permanent contraction and rigidity of the Flexor muscles, or from stiffening of the liga- mentous and other tissues surrounding the joint, the result of disease. This is effected by putting the tendon upon the stretch, and inserting a narrow, sharp-pointed knife between it and the skin : the cutting^ edge beino- then turned towards the tendon, it should be divided, taking care that the wound in the skin is not at the same time enlarged. The relation of the external popliteal nerve to the tendon of the Biceps must always be borne in mind in dividing this tendon. Muscles and Fasciae of the Leg Dissection (fig. 325).—The knee should be bent, a block placed beneath it, and the foot kept in an extended position ; then make an incision through the integfument in the middle line of the leg: to the ankle, and continue it along the dorsum of the foot to the toes. Make a second incision transversely across the ankle, and a third in the same direction across the bases of the toes; remove the flaps of integument included between these incisions in order to examine the deep fascia of the leg. The Deep Fascia of the Leg^ forms a com- plete investment to the muscles, but is not continued over the subcutaneous surfaces of the bones. It is continuous above with the fascia lata, receiving an expansion from the tendon of the Biceps on the outer side, and from the tendons of the Sartorius, Gracilis, and Semi- tendinosus on the inner side ; in front, it blends mth the periosteum covering the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, and with that covering the head and external malleolus of the fibula; below, it is continuous with the annular liga- ments of the ankle. It is thick and dense in the upper and anterior part of the leg, and gives attachment, by its deep surface, to the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum muscles : but thinner behind, where it covers the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles. Over the popliteal space it is much strengthened by transverse fibres, which stretch across from the inner to the outer hamstring muscles, and it is here perforated by the external saphenous vein. Its deep surface gives off, on the outer side of the leg, two strong intermuscular septa, which enclose the Peronei muscles, and sepa- rate them from the muscles on the anterior and posterior tibial regions and several smaller and more slender processes, which enclose the Fig. 330.—Muscles of the front of K K 2MUSCLES AND FASCIAE 500 individual muscles in each region; at the same time a broad transverse inter- muscular septum, called the dee;p transverse fascia of the leg, intervenes between the superficial and deep muscles in the posterior tibio-fibular region. Now remove the fascia by dividing it in the same direction as the integument, excepting opposite the ankle, where it should be left entire. Commence the removal of the fascia from below, opposite the tendons, and detach it in the line of direction of the muscular fibres. Muscles of the Leg These may be subdivided into three groups: those on the anterior, those on the posterior, and those on the outer side. Anterior Tibio-fibular Region Tibialis anticus. Extensor longus digitorum. Extensor proprius hallucis. Peroneus tertius. The Tibialis anticus is situated on the outer side of the tibia; it is thick and fleshy at its upper part, tendinous below. It arises from the outer tuberosity and upper two-thirds of the external surface of the shaft of the tibia; from the adjoining part of the interosseous membrane; from the deep surface of the fascia ; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the Extensor longus digitorum : the fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which is apparent on the anterior surface of the muscle at the lower third of the leg. After passing through the innermost compartment of the anterior annular ligament, it is inserted into the inner and under surface of the internal cuneiform bone, and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the fascia, and with the annular liga- ment. By its i^osterior surface, with the interosseous membrane, tibia, ankle-joint, and inner side of the tarsus : this surface also overlaps the anterior tibial vessels and nerve in the upper part of the leg. By its inner surface, with the tibia. By its outer surface, with the Extensor longus digitorum, and Extensor proprius hallucis, and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve. The Extensor proprius hallucis is a thin, elongated, and flattened muscle, situated between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the anterior surface of the fibula for about the middle two-fourths of its extent, its origin being internal to that of the Extensor longus digitorum; it also arises from the interosseous membrane to a similar extent. The fibres pass down- wards, and terminate in a tendon, which occupies the anterior border of the muscle, passes through a distinct compartment in the horizontal portion of the annular ligament, crosses the anterior tibial vessels near the bend of the ankle, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. Opposite the metatarso- phalangeal articulation, the tendon gives off a thin prolongation on each side, which covers the surface of the joint. It usually sends an expansion, from the inner side of the tendon, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the fascia, and the anterior anitular ligament. By its posterior surface, with the interosseous membrane, fibula, tibia, ankle-joint, and Extensor brevis digitorum. By its oiUer side, with the Extensor longus digitorum above, the dorsalis pedis vessels and anterior tibial nerve below. By its inner side, with the Tibialis anticus and the anterior tibial vessels above. The Extensor longus digitorum is an elongated, flattened, semipenniform muscle, situated the most externally of all the muscles on the fore part of the leg. It arises from the outer tuberosity of the tibia; from the upper three-fourths of the anterior surface of the shaft of the fibula ; from the interosseous membrane ; from the deep surface of the fascia; and from the intermuscular septa between it and the Tibialis anticus on the inner, and the Peronei on the outer side. The tendon enters a canal in the annular ligament, with the Peroneus tertius, and divides into four slips, which run across the dorsum of the foot, and are inserted into the secondPOSTERIOR TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION 501 and third phalanges of the four lesser toes. The mode in which the tendons are inserted is the following: the three inner tendons opposite the metatarso- phalangeal articulation are joined, on their outer side, by a tendon of the Extensor brevis digitorum. They all receive a fibrous expansion from the Interossei and Lumbricales, and then spread out into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the dorsal surface of the first phalanx : this aponeurosis, at the articulation of the first with the second phalanx, divides into three slips, a middle one, which is inserted into the base of the second phalanx; and two lateral slips, which, after uniting on the dorsal surface of the second phalanx, are continued onwards, to be inserted into the base of the third. Relations.—By its anterior surface, with the fascia and the annular ligament. By its ]jostcrior surface, with the fibula, interosseous membrane, ankle-joint, and Extensor brevis digitorum. By its inner side, with the Tibialis anticus. Extensor proprius hallucis, and anterior tibial vessels and nerve. By its outer side, with the Peroneus longus and brevis. The Peroneus tertius is a part of the Extensor longus digitorum, and might be described as its fifth tendon. The fibres belonging to this tendon arise from the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the fibula ; from the lower part of the interosseous membrane ; and from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peroneus brevis. The tendon, after passing through the same canal in the annular ligament as the Extensor longus digitorum, is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, on its inner side. This muscle is sometimes wanting. Nerves.—These muscles are supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. Actions.—The Tibialis anticus and Peroneus tertius are the direct flexors of the tarsus upon the leg; the former muscle, from the obliquity in the direction of its tendon, raises the inner border of the foot; and the latter, acting with the Peroneus brevis and longus, draws the outer border of the foot upwards and the sole outwards. The Extensor longus digitorum and Extensor proprius hallucis extend the phalanges of the toes, and, continuing their action, flex the tarsus upon the leg. Taking their fixed point from below, in the erect posture, all these muscles serve to fix the bones of the leg in the perpendicular position, and give increased strength to the ankle-joint. POSTEEIOK TiBIO-FIBULAR ReGION Dissection (fig. 328).—Make a vertical incision along the middle line of the back of the leg, from the lower part of the popliteal space to the heel, connecting it below by a transverse incision extending between the two malleoli; the flaps of integument being removed, the fascia and muscles should be examined. The muscles in this region of the leg are subdivided into two layers—super- ficial and deep. The superficial layer constitutes a powerful muscular mass, forming the calf of the leg. Their large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular apparatus in man, and bears a direct connection with his ordinary attitude and mode of progression. Superficial Layer Gastrocnemius. Soleus. Plantaris. The Gastrocnemius is the most superficial muscle, and forms the greater part of the calf. It arises by two heads, which are connected to the condyles of the femur by two strong flat tendons. The inner head, the larger, and a little the more posterior, arises from a depression at the upper and back part of the inner condyle. The outer head arises from the upper and back part of the external condyle, immediately above the origin of the Popliteus. Both heads, also, arise by a few tendinous and fleshy fibres from the ridges which are continued upwards from the condyles to the linea aspera. Each tendon spreads out into an aponeurosis, which covers the posterior surface of that portion of the muscle to502 MUSCLES AND FASCI.E Fig. 331- -Muscles of the back of the Superficial laj^er. which it belongs; that covering the inner head being longer and thicker than the outer. From the anterior surface of these tendinous expansions, muscular fibres are given off. The fibres in the median line, which correspond to the accessory portions of the muscle derived from the bifurcations of the linea aspera, unite at an angle upon a median tenduious raphe below- : the remaining fibres con- verge to the posterior surface of an apo- neurosis which covers the anterior surface of the muscle, and this, gradually con- tracting, miites with the tendon of the Soleus, and forms with it the tendo Achilhs. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia of the leg, which separates it from the external saphenous vem and nerve. By its deep surface, with the posterior hgament of the knee-joint, the Pophteus, Soleus, Plantaris, pophteal ves- sels, and internal pophteal nerve. The tendon of the inner head corresponds with the back part of the inner condyle, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa, which, in some cases, commmiicates mth the cavity of the knee-jomt. The tendon of the outer head contains a sesamoid fibro-cartilage (rarely osseous), where it plays over the corresponding outer con- dyle ; and one is occasionally found in the tendon of the inner head. The Gastrocnemius should be divided across, just below its origin, and turned down- wards, in order to expose the next muscles. The Soleus is a broad fiat muscle situated immediately beneath the Gastro- cnemius. It has received its name from its resemblance in shape to a sole-fish. It arises by tendinous fibres from the back part of the head of the fibula, and from the upper third of the posterior surface of its shaft; from the oblique line of the tibia, and from the middle third of its internal border; some fibres also arise from a tendinous arch placed betw^een the tibial and fibular origins of the muscle, be- neath which the posterior tibial vessels and nerve pass. The fibres pass back- wards to an aponeurosis w^hich covers the posterior surface of the muscle, and this gradually becoming thicker and narrower, joins with the tendon of the Gastrocne- mius, and forms with it the tendo Achillis. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Gastrocnemius and Plantaris. By its deep surface, with the Flexor longus digitorum. Flexor longus hallucis, Tibiahs posticus, and posterior tibial vessels and nerve, from w^hich it is separated by the transverse intermuscular septum or deep transverse fascia of the leg. The Tendo Achillis, the common tendon of the Gastrocnemius and Soleus, is Tendons of I'froneus longus and brevisP08TERI0K TIBIO-FIBULAR REGION the thickest and strongest toiulon in the body. It is about six inches in length, and commenc(^s about the middle of the le^-, but receives fleshy libres on its anterior surfaci', nearly to it^< lower end. (ii'adually becoming contracted boknv, it is inserted inLo tlie lower part of the posterior surlaee of the os calcis, a synovial bursa being interposed between the tendon and the upper part of this surface. The tendon spreads out somewhat at its lower end, so that its narrowest part is usually about an inch and a half above its insertion. The tendon is covered by the fascia and the integument, and is sepai-atcul from ilu> <l(H'p mnselcs and vessels by a considerable interval filled up with art'olai- and adipose :issue. Along its outer side, but superlicial to it, is the external saphenous vein. The Plantaris is an extremely diminutix muscle, placed between the Gastro- cnemius and Soleus, and remarkable for its long and delicate tendon. It arises from the Iowcm- part of the outer prolongation of the linea, asi)era, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. It forms a small fusiform holly, about three or four inches in length, terminating in a long slender tendon which crosses obliquely betw^een the two muscles of the calf, and, running along the inner border of the tendo Achillis, is inserted with it into the posterior part of the os calcis. This muscle is occasionally double, and is sometimes Avanting. Occasionally, its tendon is lost in tho internal annular ligament, or in the fascia of the h^g.

The Plantaris is the rudiment of a large muscle Avhich exists in some of the \o\\vv animals, and serves as a tensor of the plantai* fascia.

The Deep Transverse Fascia of the leg is a broad, transverse, intermuscular septum, interposed between the superficial and deep muscles in the posterior tibio-fibular region. On either side it is connected to the margins of the tibia and fibula. Above, Avhere it covers the Popliteus, it is thick and dense, and receives an expansion from the tendon of ihv Semimembi'aiu^sns ; it is tbiinun- in the middle of the leg ; but belov.', where it co\ ei's the t(>ndons passing behind the malleoli, it is thickened.

This fascia should now be remo\'ed, couuui ueiuu- from below opposite^ the tendons, and detaching it from the nmscles in the dircctiou of their libres. The Popliteus is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, which forms part of the floor of the poplitt^al space, and is covered by a tendinous expansion, derived from the Semimembranosus nnisele. It arises by a strong tendon about an inch in length, from a deep depression on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, and from the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; and is inserted into the innerMUSCLES AND FASCIA 11 -piG. 332.—Muscles of the back of the leg.

The tendon of the muscle is covered by that of the Biceps and the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint; it grooves the outer border of the external semilunar fibro-cartilage, and is invested by the synovial membrane of the knee- joint. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia above mentioned, which separates it from the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, popliteal vessels, and internal popliteal nerve. By its deep surface, with the superior tibio-fibular articulation, and back of the tibia. The Flexor longus hallucis is situated on the fibular side of the leg, and is the most superficial and largest of the three next muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the posterior surface of the shaft of the fibula, with the exception of an inch at its lowest part; from the lower part of the interosseous membrane ; from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peronei, externally; and from the fascia covering the Tibialis posticus, which is attached to the inner border of the fibula externally, and to the posterior sur- face of the tibia, between the origins of the Tibialis posticus and the Flexor longus digitorum, internally. The fibres pass obliquely downw^ards and backwards, and terminate round a tendon which occupies nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muscle. This tendon passes through a groove on the posterior surface of the tibia; it then passes through another groove on the posterior surface of the astragalus, and along a third groove, beneath the sustenta- culum tali of the os calcis, into the sole of the foot, where it runs forwards between the two heads of the Flexor brevis hallucis, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. The grooves in the astragalus and os calcis, which contain the tendon of the muscle, are converted by tendinous fibres into distinct canals, lined by synovial membrane ; and as the tendon crosses the sole of the foot, it is connected to the common flexor by a tendinous slip. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Soleus and tendo Achillis, from which it is separated by the deep transverse fascia. By its deeiJ surface, with the fibula.

By 1:POSTERIOR TIBIO FIBULAR REGION That is, in the order of dissection of the sole of the foot. its inner border, with the Tibiahs posticus, and posterior tibial vessels and nerve. The Flexor longus digitorum (])crforans) is situated on the tibial side of the leg. At its origin, it is thin and pointed, but gradually increases in size as it descends. It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia imme- diately below the oblique line, to within three inches of its extremity interna] to the tibial origin of the Tibialis posticus ; some fibres also arise from the fascia covering the Tibialis posticus. The fibres terminate in a tendon, which runs nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muscle. This tendon passes behind the internal malleolus, in a groove, common to it and the Tibialis posticus, but separated from the latter by a fibrous septum ; each tendon being contained in a special sheath lined by a separate synovial membrane. It then passes obliquely forwards and outwards, crossing over the internal lateral ligament into the sole of the foot (fig. 334), where, crossing superficially to the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis,* to which it is connected by a strong tendinous slip, it becomes expanded, is joined by the Flexor accessorius, and finally divides into four tendons which are inserted into the bases of the last phalanges of the four lesser toes, each tendon passing- through a fissure in the tendon of the Flexor brevis digitorum opposite the base of the first phalanges. Relations.—In the leg : by its superficicd surface, with the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and the deep transverse fascia, which separates it from the Soleus muscle ; by its deep surface, with the tibia and Tibialis posticus. In the foot, it is covered by the Abductor hallucis and Flexor brevis digitorum, and crosses superficial to the Flexor longus hallucis. The Tibialis posticus lies between the two preceding muscles, and is the most deeply seated of all the muscles in the leg. It commences above by two pointed processes, separated by an angular interval, through which the anterior tibial vessels x^ass forwards to the front of the leg. It arises from the whole of the posterior surface of the interosseous membrane, excepting its lowest part, from the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia, external to the Flexor longus digitorum, between the commencement of the oblique line above, and the middle of the external border of the bone below, and from the upper two-thirds of the internal surface of the fibula ; some fibres also arise from the deep transverse fascia, and from the intermuscular septa, separating it from the adjacent muscles on each side. This muscle, in the lower fourth of the leg, passes in front of the Flexor longus digitorum, and terminates in a tendon, which passes through a groove behmd the inner malleolus, with the tendon of that muscle, but enclosed in a separate sheath ; it then passes through another sheath, over the internal lateral ligament into the foot, and then beneath the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament, and is inserted into the tuberosity of the navicular and internal cuneiform bones. The tendon of this muscle contains a sesamoid fibro-cartilage, as it passes over the navicular bone, and gives off fibrous expansions, one of which passes backwards to the sustentaculum tali of the os calcis, others outwards to the middle and external cuneiform and cuboid, and some forwards to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones (fig. 335). Relations.—By its sujjerficial surface, with the Soleus, from which it is separated by the deep transverse fascia, the Flexor longus digitorum, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, and the peroneal vessels. By its c/eep surface, with the interosseous ligament, the tibia, fibula, and ankle-joint. Nerves.—The Popliteus is supplied by the internal popliteal nerve, the remaining muscles of this group by the posterior tibial nerve. Actions.—The Popliteus assists in flexing the leg upon the thigh ; when the leg is flexed, it will rotate the tibia inwards. It is especially called into action at the commencement of the act of bending the knee, inasmuch as it produces a slight inward rotation of the tibia, which is essential in the early stage of this5o6 MUSCLES AND FASCIA movement. The Tibialis posticus is a direct extensor of the tarsus upon the leg ; acting in conjunction with the Tibialis anticus, it turns the sole of the foot inwards, antagonising the Peroneus longus, which turns it outwards. The Flexor longus digitorum and Flexor longus hallucis are the direct Flexors of the phalanges, and, continuing their action, extend the foot upon the leg ; they assist the Gastrocnemius and Soleus in extending the foot, as in the act of walking, or in standing on tiptoe. In consequence of the oblique direction of the tendon of the long flexor, the toes would be drawn inwards, were it not for the Flexor accessorius muscle, which is inserted into the outer side of its tendon, and draws it to the middle line of the foot during its action. Taking their fixed point from the foot, these muscles serve to maintain the upright posture by steadying the tibia and fibula, perpendicularly, upon the ankle-joint. They also serve to raise these bones from the oblique position they assume in the stooping posture. Outer or Fibular Eegion Peroneus longus. Peroneus brevis. Dissection.—The muscles are readily exposed, by removing the fascia covering their surface, from below upwards, in the line of direction of their fibres. The Peroneus longus is situated at the upper part of the outer side of the leg, and is the more superficial of the two muscles. It arises from the head, and upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula, from the deep surface of the fascia, and from the intermuscular septa, between it and the muscles on the front, and those on the back of the leg. It terminates in a long tendon, which passes behind the outer malleolus, in a groove common to it and the Peroneus brevis, the groove being converted into a canal by a fibrous band, and the tendons invested by a common synovial membrane ; it is then reflected, obliquely forwards, across the outer side of the os calcis, being contained in a separate fibrous sheath, lined by a prolongation of the synovial membrane from that which lines the groove behind the malleolus. Having reached the outer side of the cuboid bone, it runs in a groove on the under surface of that bone, which is converted into a canal by the long calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and is lined by a synovial membrane : the tendon then crosses obliquely the sole of the foot, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe and the internal cuneiform bone. Occasionally it sends a slip to the base of the second metatarsal bone. The tendon changes its direction at two points : first, behind the external malleolus; secondly, on the outer side of the cuboid bone; in both of these situations the tendon is thickened, and, in the latter, a sesamoid fibro-cartilage, or sometimes a bone, is usually developed in its substance. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia and integument; by its deep surface, with the fibula, the Peroneus brevis, os calcis, and cuboid bone ; by its anterior border, with an intermuscular septum, which intervenes between it and the Extensor longus digitorum ; by its posterior border, with an intermuscular septum, which separates it from the Soleus above, and the Flexor longus hallucis below. The Peroneus brevis lies beneath the Peroneus longus, and is shorter and smaller than it. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the external surface of the shaft of the fibula, internal to the Peroneus longus ; and from the intermuscular septa separating it from the adjacent muscles on the front and back part of the leg. The fibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which runs in front of that of the preceding muscle through the same groove, behind the external malleolus, being contained in the same fibrous sheath, and lubricated by the same synovial membrane. It then passes through a separate sheath on the outer side of the os calcis, above that for the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and is finally inserted into the tuberosity at the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, on its outer side. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the Peroneus longus and the fasciaOF THE FOOT of the leg and foot. By its deep surface, with the fibula and outer side of the OS calcis. Nerves.—The Peroneus longus and brevis are supplied by the musculo-cutaneous branch of the external popliteal nerve. Actions.—The Peroneus longus and brevis extend the foot upon the leg, in conjunction with the Tibialis posticus, antagonising the Tibialis anticus and Peroneus tertius, which are flexors of the foot. The Peroneus longus also everts the sole of the foot; hence the extreme eversion occasionally observed in fracture of the lower end of the fibula, where that bone offers no resistance to the action of this muscle. Taking their fixed point below, the Peronei serve to steady the leg upon the foot. This is especially the case in standing upon one leg, when the tendency of the superincumbent weight is to throw the leg inwards : the Peroneus longus overcomes this tendency by drawing on the outer side of the leg, and thus maintains the perpendicular direction of the limb. Surgical Anatomy.—The student should now consider the position of the tendons of the various muscles of the leg, their relation with the ankle-joint and surrounding blood- vessels, and especially their action upon the foot, as their rigidity and contraction give rise to one or other of the kinds of deformity known as club foot. The most simple and common deformity, and one that is rarely, if ever, congenital, is the talijpes equinus, the heel being raised by rigidity and contraction of the Gastrocnemius muscle, and the patient walking upon the ball of the foot. In the talijpes varus, the foot is forcibly adclucted and the inner side of the sole raised, sometimes to a right angle with the ground, by the action of the Tibialis anticus and posticus. In the talipes valgus, the outer edge of the foot is raised by the Peronei muscles, and the patient walks on the inner ankle. In the talipes calcaneus the toes are raised by the Extensor muscles, the heel is depressed, and the patient walks upon it. Other varieties of deformity are met with, as the talipes equina- varus, equino-valgus, and calcaneo-valgus, whose names sufficiently indicate their nature. Of these, the talipes equino-varus is the most common congenital form ; the heel is raised by the tendo A chillis, the inner border of the foot drawn upwards by the Tibialis anticus, the anterior two-thirds twisted inwards by the Tibialis posticus, and the arch increased by the contraction of the plantar fascia, so that the patient walks on the middle of the outer border of the foot. Each of these deformities may be successfully relieved (after other remedies fail) by division of the opposing tendons and fascia : by this means, the foot regains its proper position, and the tendons heal by the organisation of lymph thrown out between the divided ends. The operation is easily performed by putting the contracted tendon upon the stretch, and di\'iding it by means of a narrow, sharp pointed knife inserted beneath it. Eupture of a few of the fibres of the Gastrocnemius, or rupture of the Plantaris tendon not uncommonly occurs, especially in men somewhat advanced in life, from some sudden exertion, and frequently occurs during the game of lawn tennis, and is hence known as ' lawn-tennis leg.' The accident is accompanied by a sudden pain, and produces a sensa- tion as if the individual had been struck a violent blow on the part. The tendo Achillis is also sometimes ruptured. It is stated that John Hunter ruptured his tendo Achillis whilst dancing, at the age of forty. Muscles and Fascia of the Foot The fibrous bands which bind down the tendons in front of and behind the ankle in their passage to the foot, should now be examined; they are termed the annular ligaments, and are three in number—anterior, internal, and external. The Anterior Annular Ligament consists of a superior or vertical portion, which binds down the extensor tendons as they descend on the front of the tibia and fibula ; and an inferior or horizontal portion, which retains them in connection with the tarsus, the two portions being connected by a thin intervening layer of fascia. The vertical portion is attached externally to the lower end of the fibula, internally to the tibia, and above is continuous with the fascia of the leg ; it con- tains only one synovial sheath, for the tendon of the Tibialis anticus ; the other tendons and the anterior tibial vessels and nerve passing beneath it, but without any distinct synovial sheath. The horizontal portion is attached externally to the upper surface of the os calcis, in front of the depression for the interosseous ligament; it passes upwards and inwards, as a double layer, one lamina passing in front, and the other behind, the Peroneus tertius and Extensor longus digitorum.5o8 MUSCLES AND FASCL^ At the iniier border of the latter tendon, these two layers join togei)her, forming a sort of loop or sheath in which the tendons are enclosed, surrounded by a synovial membrane. From the inner extremity of this loop, two bands are given off: one passes upwards and inwards to be attached to the internal malleolus, passing over the Extensor proprius hallucis and vessels and nerves, but enclosing the Tibialis anticus and its synovial sheath by a splitting of its fibres. The other limb passes downwards and inwards to be attached to the navicular and internal cuneiform bones, and passes over both the tendon of the Extensor proprius hallucis and the Tibialis anticus and also the vessels and nerves. These two tendons are contained in separate synovial sheaths situated beneath the ligament. It will thus be seen that the horizontal portion of the ligament is like the letter Y, the foot of the letter being attached to the os calcis, and the two diverging arms to the tibia and navicular and internal cuneiform respectively. The Internal Annular Ligament is a strong fibrous band, which extends from the inner malleolus above, to the internal margin of the os calcis below, converting a series of grooves in this situation into canals, for the passage of the tendons of the Flexor muscles and vessels into the sole of the foot. It is continuous by its upper border with the deep fascia of the leg, and by its lower border with the plantar fascia and the fibres of origin of the Abductor hallucis muscle. The three canals which it forms transmit, from within outwards, first, the tendon of the Tibialis posticus ; second, the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum ; then the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, which run through a broad space beneath the ligament; lastly, in a canal formed partly by the astragalus, the tendon of the Flexor longus. hallucis. Each of these canals is lined by a separate synovial membrane. The External Annular Ligament extends from the extremity of the outer malleolus to the outer surface of the os calcis : it binds down the tendons of the Peronei muscles in their passage beneath the outer ankle. The two tendons are enclosed in one synovial sac. Dissection of the Sole of the Foot.—The foot should be placed on a high block with the sole uppermost, and firmly secured in that position. Carry an incision round the heel and along the inner and outer borders of the foot to the great and little toes. This incision should divide the integument and thick layer of granular fat beneath, until the fascia is visible; the skin and fat should then be removed from the fascia in a direction from behind forwards, as seen in fig. 328. The Plantar Fascia, the densest of all the fibrous membranes, is of great strength, and consists of dense pearly-white glistening fibres, disposed, for the most part, longitudinally : it is divided into a central and two lateral portions. The central portion, the thickest, is narrow behind and attached to the inner tubercle of the os calcis, behind the origin of the Flexor brevis digitorum; and becoming broader and thinner in front, divides near the heads of the metatarsal bones into five processes, one ^or each of the toes. Each of these processes divides opposite the metatarso-phalangeal articulation into two strata, superficial and deep. The superficial stratum is inserted into the skin of the transverse sulcus which divides the toes from the sole. The deeper stratum divides into two slips which embrace the sides of the flexor tendons of the toes, and blend with the sheaths of the tendons and laterally with the transverse metatarsal ligament, thus forming a series of arches through which the tendons of the short and long flexors pass to the toes. The intervals left between the five processes allow the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the Lumbricales muscles, to become superficial. At the point of division of the fascia into processes and slips, numerous transverse fibres are superadded, which serve to increase the strength of the fascia at this part by binding the processes together, and connecting them with the integument. The central portion of the plantar fascia is continuous with the lateral portions at each side, and sends upwards into the foot, at their point of junction, two strong vertical intermuscular septa, broader in front than behind, which separate the middle from the external and internal plantar group of muscles ; from these again thinner transverse septa are derived, which separate the various layers of muscles in thisPLANTAR REGION OF THE FOOT region. The upper surface of this fascia gives attachment behind to the Flexor brevis digitorum muscle. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are thinner than the central piece, and cover the sides of the foot. The outer portion covers the under surface of the Adductor minimi digiti; it is thick behind, thin in front, and extends from the os calcis, forwards, to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, into the outer side of which it is attached; it is con- tinuous internally with the middle portion of the plantar fascia, and externally with the dorsal fascia. The inner portion is very thin, and covers the Abductor hallucis muscle ; it is attached behind to the internal annular ligament, and is continuous around the side of the foot with the dorsal fascia, and externally with the middle portion of the plantar'fascia. Muscles of the Foot These are found in two regions: i. On the dorsum. 2. On the plantar surface. 1. DoESAL Region Extensor brevis digitorum. The Fascia on the dorsum of the foot is a thin membranous layer, continuous above with the anterior margin of the annular ligament; it becomes gradually lost opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and on each side blends with the lateral portions of the plantar fascia; it forms a sheath for the tendons placed on the dorsum of the foot. On the removal of this fascia, the muscles and tendons of the dorsal region of the foot are exposed. The Extensor brevis digitorum (fig. 330) is a broad thin muscle, which arises from the fore part of the upper and outer surfaces of the os calcis, in front of the groove for the Peroneus brevis ; from the external calcaneo-astragaloid ligament; and from the horizontal portion of the anterior annular ligament. It passes obliquely across the dorsum of the foot, and terminates in four tendons. The innermost, which is the largest, is inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, crossing the Dorsalis pedis artery ; the other three, into the outer sides of the long extensor tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the fascia of the foot, the tendons of the Extensor longus digitorum and Extensor proprius hallucis. By its deep surface, with the tarsal and metatarsal bones, and the Dorsal interossei muscles. Nerves.—It is supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. Actions.—The Extensor brevis digitorum is an accessory to the long Extensor, extending the phalanges of the four inner toes, but acting only on the first phalanx of the great toe. The obliquity of its direction counteracts the oblique movement given to the toes by the long Extensor, so that, both muscles acting together, the toes are evenly extended. 2. Plantab Region The muscles in the plantar region of the foot may be divided into three groups, in a similar manner to those in the hand. Those of the internal plantar region are connected with the great toe, and correspond with those of the thumb ; those of the external plantar region are connected with the little toe, and correspond with those of the little finger; and those of the middle plantar region are con- nected with the tendons intervening between the two former groups. But in order to facilitate the dissection of these muscles, it will be found more convenient to divide them into four layers, as they present themselves, in the order in which they are successively exposed.MUSCLES AND FASCIA That is, in the order of dissection of the sole of the foot.

First layer. inner tubercle on the under surface of the OS calcis ; from the internal annular ligament ; from the plantar fascia; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the Flexor brevis digitorum. The fibres terminate in a tendon, w^hich is inserted, together with the innermost ten- don of the Flexor brevis hallucis, into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the plantar fascia. By its deep surface, wdth the Flexor brevis hallucis, the Flexor accessorius, and the tendons of the Flexor longus digitorum and Flexor longus hallucis, the Tibialis anticus and posticus, the plantar vessels and nerves, and the articulations of the tarsus. The Flexor brevis digitorum {perfor- atus) lies in the middle of the sole of the foot, immediately beneath * the plantar fascia, with wdiich it is firmly united. It arises by a narrow tendinous process, from the inner tubercle of the os calcis, from the central part of the plantar fascia, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It passes forwards, and divides into four tendons. Opposite the bases of the first phalanges, each tendon divides into two slips, to allow of the passage of the corresponding tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum ; the two portions of the tendon then unite and form a grooved channel for the reception of the accompanying long flexor tendon. Finally, they divide a second time, to be inserted into the sides of the second phalanges about their middle. The mode of division of the tendons of the Flexor brevis digitorum, and their insertion into the phalanges, is analogous to the Flexor sublimis in the hand. Relations.—By its supjerficial surface, with the plantar fascia. By its deep surface, with the Flexor accessorius, the Lumbricales, the tendons of the Flexor longus digitorum, and the external plantar vessels and nerve, from which it is separated by a thin layer of fascia. The outer and i^iner borders are separated from the adjacent muscles by means of vertical prolongations of the plantar fascia.PLANTAR REGION OF THE FOOT. SECOND LAYER Fig 334- -Muscles of the sole of the foot. Second layer. Fibrous Sheaths of the Flexor Tendons.—These are not so well marked as in the fingers. The flexor tendons of the toes as they run along the phalanges are retained against the hones by a fibrous sheath, forming osseo-aponeurotic canals. These sheaths are formed by strong fibrous bands, which arch across the tendons, and are attached on each side to the margins of the phalanges. Opposite the middle of the proximal and second phalanges the sheath is very strong, and the fibres pass transversely; but opposite the joints it is much thinner, and the fibres pass obliquely. Each sheath is lined by a synovial membrane, which is reflected on the contained tendon. The Abductor minimi digitilies along the outer border of the foot. It arises, by a very broad origin, from the outer tubercle of the os calcis, from the under surface of the os calcis in front of both tubercles, from the fore part of the inner tubercle, from the plantar fascia, and the intermuscular septum between it and the Flexor brevis digitorum. Its tendon, after gliding over a smooth facet on the under surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, is inserted with the short Flexor of the little toe into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the plantar fascia. By its deej) sur- face, with the Flexor accessorius, the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, the long- plantar ligament, and the tendon of the Peroneus longus. On its inner side are the external plantar vessels and nerve, and it is separated from the Flexor brevis digitorum by a vertical septum of fascia. Dissection.—The muscles of the super- ficial layer should be divided at their origin, by inserting the knife beneath each, and cut- ting obliquely backwards, so as to detach them from the bone ; they should then be drawn forwards, in order to expose the second layer, but not cut away at their insertion. The two layers are separated by a thin mem- brane, the deep plantar fascia, on the re- moval of which is seen the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum, the Flexor acces- sorius, the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis. and the Lumbricales. The long flexor tendons cross each other at an acute angle, the Flexor longus hallucis running along the inner side of the foot, on a plane superior to that of the Flexor longus digi- torum, the direction of which is obliquely outwards. Second Layer Flexor accessorius. Lumbricales. The Flexor accessorius arises by two heads : the inner or larger, which is muscular, being attached to the inner concave surface of the os calcis, and to the inferior calcaneo-navicular ligament; the outer head, flat and tendinous, to the mider surface of the os calcis, in front of its outer tubercle, and to the long plantar ligament: the two portions join at an acute angle, and are inserted into the outerMUSCLES AND FASCIA margin and upper and under surfaces of the tendon of the Flexor longus digitorum, forming a kind of groove, in Avhich the tendon is lodged.* Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the muscles of the superficial layer, from which it is separated by the external plantar vessels and nerves. By its deep surface, with the os calcis, and long calcaneo-cuboid ligament. The Lumbricales are four small muscles, accessory to the tendons of the Flexor longus digitorum: they arise from the tendons of the long flexor, as far back as their angle of division, each arising Fig. 335.—Muscles of the sole of the foot. ^^"0^^ ^^o tendons, except the internal one. Each muscle terminates in a tendon, which passes forwards on the inner side of each of the lesser toes, and is inserted into the expansion of the long extensor and base of the first phalanx of the corresponding toe. Dissection.—The flexor tendons should be divided at the back part of the foot, and the Flexor accessorius at its origin, and drawn forwards, in order to expose the third layer. Tliircl Layer Flexor brevis hallucis. Adductor obliquus hallucis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Adductor transA^ersus hallucis. The Flexor brevis hallucis arises, by a pointed tendinous process, from the inner border of the cuboid bone, from the contiguous portion of the external cuneiform, and from the pro- longation of the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, which is attached to that bone. The muscle divides, in front, into two portions, which are inserted into the inner and outer sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, a sesa- moid bone being developed in each ten- don at its insertion. The inner portion of this muscle is blended with the Abductor hallucis previous to its insertion, the outer with the Adductor obliquus hallucis, and the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis lies in a groove between them. Relations.—By its superficial sur- face, with the Abductor hallucis, the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis, and plantar fascia. By its deep surface, with the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and metatarsal bone of the great toe. By its inner border, with the Abductor hallucis. By its outer border, with the Adductor obliquus hallucis. The Adductor obliquus hallucis is a large, thick, fleshy mass, passing obliquely across the foot, and occupying the hollow space between the four inner metatarsal bones. It arises from the tarsal extremities of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, and from the sheath of the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and * According to Turner, the fibres of the Flexor accessorius end in aponeurotic bands, which contribute slips to the second, third, and fourth digits. Third layer.PLANTAR REGION OF THE FOOT. FOURTH LAYER 513 is inserted, together with the outer portion of the Flexor brevis hallucis, into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. The small muscles of the great toe, the Abductor, Flexor brevis, Adductor obliquus, and Adductor transversus, like the similar muscles of the thumb, give off fibrous expansions, at their insertions, to blend with the long Extensor tendon. The Flexor brevis minimi digiti hes on the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and much resembles one of the Interossei. It arises from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and from the sheath of the Peroneus longus; its tendon is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little toe on its outer side. Relations.—By its superficial surface, with the plantar fascia and tendon of the Abductor minimi digiti. By its deei:) surface, with the fifth metatarsal bone. The Adductor transversus hallucis (Transversusxiedis) is a narrow, flat, muscular fasciculus, stretched transversely across the heads of the metatarsal bones, between them and the flexor tendons. It arises from the inferior metatarso-phalangeal ligaments of the three outer toes, sometimes only from the third and fourth and from the transverse ligament of the metatarsus ; and is inserted into the outer side Fig. 336.—The Dorsal interossei. Fig. 337.—The Plantar interossei. Left foot. Left foot. of the first phalanx of the great toe ; its fibres being blended with the tendon of insertion of the Adductor obliquus hallucis. Relations.—By its stii^erficial surface, with the tendons of the long and short Flexors and Lumbricales. By its cleeiJ surface, with the Interossei. Fourth Layer The Interossei. The Interossei muscles in the foot are similar to those in the hand, with this exception, that they are grouped around the middle line of the second toe, instead of the middle line of the third finger, as in the hand. They are seven in number, and consist of two groups, dorsal and plantar. The Dorsal interossei, four in number, are situated between the metatarsal bones. They are bipenniform muscles, arising by two heads from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones between which they are placed ; their tendons are L L514 SURFACE FORM OF inserted into the bases of the first phalanges, and into the aponeurosis of the common extensor tendon. In the angular interval left between the heads of each muscle at its posterior extremity the perforating arteries pass to the dorsum of the foot; except in the First interosseous muscle, where the interval allows the passage of the communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis artery. The First dorsal inter- osseous muscle is inserted into the inner side of the second toe ; the other three are inserted into the outer sides of the second, third, and fourth toes. The Plantar interossei, three in number, lie beneath, rather than between, the metatarsal bones. They are single muscles, and are each connected with but one metatarsal bone. They arise from the base and inner sides of the shaft of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones, and are inserted into the inner sides of the bases of the first phalanges of the same toes, and into the aponeurosis of the common extensor tendon. Nerves.—The Flexor brevis digitorum, the Flexor brevis and Abductor hallucis, and the two inner Lumbricales are supplied by the internal plantar nerve. All the other muscles in the sole of the foot by the external plantar. The First and Second dorsal interossei muscles receive extra filaments from the ganglionic enlargement of the anterior tibial nerve on the dorsum of the foot. Actions.—All the muscles of the foot act upon the toes, and for purposes of description as regards their action may be grouped as Abductors, Adductors, Flexors or Extensors. The Abductors are the Dorsal interossei, the Abductor hallucis, and the Abductor minimi digiti. The Dorsal interossei are abductors from an imaginary line passing through the axis of the second toe, so that the first muscle draws the second toe inwards, towards the great toe; the second muscle draws the same toe outwards ; the third draws the third toe, and the fourth draws the fourth toe in the same direction. Like the interossei in the hand, they also assist in flexing the proximal phalanx and extending the two terminal phalanges. The Abductor hallucis abducts the great toe from the others and also flexes the proximal phalanx of this toe. And in the same way the action of the Abductor minimi digiti is twofold, as an abductor of this toe from the others, and also as a flexor of the proximal phalanx. The Adductors are the Plantar interossei, the Adductor obliquus hallucis, and the Adductor transversus hallucis. The plantar interosseous muscles adduct the third, fourth, and fifth toes, towards the imaginary line passing through the second toe, and by means of their insertion into the aponeurosis of the extensor tendon they assist in flexing the proximal phalanx and extending the two terminal phalanges. The Adductor obliquus hallucis is chiefly concerned in adducting the great toe towards the second one, but also assists in flexing this toe. The Adductor transversus hallucis approximates all the toes and thus increases the curve of the transverse arch of the metatarsus. The Flexors are the Flexor brevis digitorum, the Flexor accessorius, the Flexor brevis hallucis, the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the Lumbricales. The Flexor brevis digitorum flexes the second phalanges upon the first, and continuing its action flexes the first phalanges also and brings the toes together. The Flexor accessorius assists the Long flexor of the toes and converts the obhque pull of the tendons of that muscle into a direct backward pull upon the toes. The Flexor brevis minimi digiti flexes the little toe and draws its metatarsal bone downwards and inwards. The Lumbricales, like the corresponding muscles in the hand, assist in flexing the proximal phalanx, and by their insertion into the long extensor tendon aid that muscle in straightening the two terminal phalanges. The only muscle in the Extensor group is the Extensor brevis digitorum. It extends the first phalanx of the great toe and assists the long extensor in extending the next three toes, and at the same time gives to the toes an outward direction when they are extended. Surface Form.—Of the muscles of the thigh, those of the iliac region have no influence on surface form, while those of the anterior femoral region, being to a great extent superficial, largely contribute to the surface form of this part of the body. The Tensor vagincB femoris produces a broad elevation immediately below the anterior portion of theTHE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY 515 crest of the ilium and behind the anterior superior spinous process. From its lower border, a longitudinal groove, corresponding to the ilio-tibial band, may be seen running down the outer side of the thigh to the outer side of the knee-joint. The Sartorius muscle, when it is brought into action by flexing the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the pelvis, and rotating the thigh outwards, presents a well-marked surface form. At its upper part, where it constitutes the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangle, it forms a prominent oblique ridge, which becomes changed into a flattened plane below, and this gradually merges in a general fulness on the inner side of the knee-joint. When the Sartorius is not in action, a depression exists between the Extensor quadriceps and the xldductor muscles, running obliquely downwards and inwards from the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the inner side of the knee, which corresponds to this muscle. In the depressed angle formed by the divergence of the Sartorius and Tensor vaginae femoris muscles, just below the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, the Rectus femoris muscle appears, and, below this, determines to a great extent the convex form of the front of the thigh. In a well-developed subject, the borders of the muscle, when in action, are clearly to be defined. The Vastus externus forms a long flattened plane on the outer side of the thigh, traversed by the longitudinal groove formed by the ilio-tibial band. The Vastus internus, on the inner side of the lower half of the thigh, gives rise to a considerable prominence, which increases towards the knee and terminates somewhat abruptly in this situation with a full, curved outline. The Crureiis and Siihcrureus are completely hidden and do not directly influence surface form. The Adductor muscles, constituting the internal femoral group, are not to be individually distinguished from each other, with the exception of the upper tendon of the Adductor longus and the lower tendon of the Adductor magnus. The upper tendon of the Adductor longus, when the muscle is in action, stands out as a prominent ridge, which runs obliquely downwards and outwards from the neighbourhood of the pubic spine, and forms the inner boundary of a flattened triangular space on the upper part of the front of the thigh, known as Scarpa's triangle. The lower tendon of the Adductor magnus can be distinctly felt as a short ridge extending down to the Adductor tubercle on the internal condyle, between the Sartorius and Vastus internus. The Adductor group of muscles fills in the triangular space at the upper part of the thigh, formed between the oblique femur and the pelvic wall, and to them is due the contour of the inner border of the thigh, the Gracilis largely contributing to the smoothness of the outline. These muscles are not marked off on the surface from those of the posterior femoral region by any intermuscular marking; but on the outer side of the thigh these latter muscles are defined from the Vastus externus by a distinct marking, corresponding to the external intermuscular septum. The Gluteus maximus and a part of the Gluteus medius are the only muscles of the buttock which influence surface form. The other part of the Gluteus medius, the Gluteus minimus, and the External rotators are completely hidden. The Gluteus maximus forms the full rounded outline of the buttock ; it is more prominent behind, compressed in front, and terminates at its tendinous insertion in a depression immediately behind the great trochanter. Its lower border does not correspond to the gluteal fold, but is much more oblique, being marked by a line drawn from the side of the coccyx to the lower part of the great trochanter. From beneath the fold of the buttock, the Ha^nstring muscles appear, at first narrow and not well marked, but as they descend, becoming more prominent and widened out, and eventually dividing into two well-marked ridges, which form the upper boundaries of the popliteal space, being formed by the tendons of the inner and outer hamstring muscles respectively. In the upper part of the thigh these muscles are not to be individually distinguished from each other, but lower down, the separation between the Semitendinosus and Semimembranosus is denoted by a slight intermuscular marking. The external hamstring tendon formed by the Biceps is seen as a thick cord running down to the head of the fibula. The inner hamstring tendons comprise the Semitendinosus, the Semimembranosus, and the Gracilis. The Semitendinosus is the most internal of these, and can be felt, in certain positions of the limb, as a sharp cord; the Semimembranosus is thick, and the Gracilis is situated a little further forwards than the other two. All the muscles on the front of the leg appear to a certain extent somewhere on the surface, but the form of this region is mainly dependent upon the Tibialis anticus and the Extensor longus digitorum. The Tibialis anticus is well marked, and presents a fusiform enlargement at the outer side of the tibia, and projects beyond the crest of the shin bone. From the muscular mass, its tendon may be traced downwards, standing out boldly, when the muscle is in action, on the front of the tibia and ankle-joint, and coursing down to its insertion along the inner border of the foot. A well-marked groove separates this muscle externally from the Extensor longus digitorum, which fills up the rest of the space between the upper part of the shaft of the tibia and fibula. It does not present so bold an outline as the Tibialis anticus, and its tendon below, diverging from the tendon of the Tibialis anticus, forms a sort of plane, in which may be seen the tendon of the Extensor proprius hallucis. A. groove on the outer side of the Extensor longus digitorum, seen most plainly when the nmscle is in action, separates from it a slight eminence corresponding to the Peroneiis tertius. The fleshy fibres of the Peroneus longus are strongly marked at the upper part of the outer side of the leg, especially when the nmscle is in action. It forms a bold swelling, separated by furrows from the Extensor longus digitorum in front and the Soleus behind. Below, the L L 25i6 SUEGICAL ANATOMY fleshy fibres terminate abruptly in a tendon which overlaps the more flattened form of the Peroneus brevis. At the External malleolus the tendon of the Peroneus brevis is more marked than that of the Peroneus longus. On the dorsum of the foot the tendons of the Extensor muscles, emerging from beneath the anterior annular ligament, spread out and can be distinguished in the following order: the most internal and largest is the Tibialis anticus, then the Extensor proprius hallucis; next comes the Extensor longus digitorum, dividing into four tendons to the four outer toes ; and lastly, most externally, is the Peroneus tertius. The flattened form of the dorsum of the foot is relieved by the rounded outline of the fleshy belly of the JExtensor hi^evis digitorum, which forms a soft fulness on the outer side of the tarsus in front of the external malleolus, and by the Dorsal interossei, which bulge between the metatarsal bones. At the back of the knee is the popliteal space, bounded above b}' the tendons of the Hamstring muscles; below% b}' the two heads of the Gastrocnemius. Below this space is the prominent fleshy mass of the calf of the leg, produced by the Gastrocnemius and Soleus. When these muscles are in action, as in standing on tiptoe, the borders of the Gastrocnemius are well defined, presenting two curved lines, wdiich converge to the tendon of insertion. Of these borders, the inner is more prominent than the outer. The fleshy mass of the calf terminates somewhat abruptly below in the tendo Achillis, which stands out prominently on the lower part of the back of the leg. It presents a somewhat tapering form in the upper three-fourths of its extent, but widens out slightly below. "When the muscles of the calf are in action, the lateral portions of the Soleus may be seen, forming curved eminences, of which the outer is the longer, on either side of the Gastrocnemius. Behind the inner border of the lower part of the shaft of the tibia, a well-marked ridge, produced by the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, is visible when this muscle is in a state of contraction. On the sole of the foot the superficial layer of muscles influences surface form; the Abductor minimi digiti most markedly. This muscle forms a narrow rounded elevation along the outer border of the foot, while the Abductor hallucis does the same, though to a less extent, on the inner side. The Flexor brevis digitorum, bound down by the plantar fascia, is not very apparent; it produces a flattened form, covered by the thickened skin of the sole, wdiich is here thrown into numerous wrinkles. SUEGICAL ANATOMY The student should now consider the effects produced by the action of the various muscles in fractures of the bones of the lower extremitv Fig. 338. -Fracture of the neck of the femur within the capsular ligament. The more common forms of fracture are selected for illustration and descrip- tion. In fracture of the neck of the femur internal to the capsiUar ligament (fig. 338), the character- istic marks are slight shortening of the limb, and eversion of the foot, neither of which sym- ptoms occurs, however, in some cases imtil some time after the injury. The eversion is caused by the weight of the limb rotating it outwards. The shorten- ing is produced by the action of the Glutei, and by the Rectus femoris in front, and the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus be- hind. In fracture of the femur just beloiv the trochanters (fig. 339), the upper fragment, the por- tion chiefly displaced, is tilted forwards almost at right angles with the pelvis, by the combined action of the Psoas and Iliacus; and, at the same time, everted and drawn outwards by the external rotator and Glutei muscles, causing a marked prominence at the upper and outer side of the thigh, and much pain from the bruising and laceration of the muscles. The limb is shortened, in consequence of the lower fragment being drawn Pyriformis Gemellus superior Obturator internus Gemelhts inferior Obturator externus Qua dratus femorisOF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWEE EXTEEMITY upwards by the Rectus in front, and the Biceps, Semimembranosus, and Semitendinosus behind ; and, at the same time, everted ; and the upper end thrown outwards and the lower inwards by the Pectineus and Adductor muscles. This fracture may be reduced in two different methods: either by direct relaxation of all the opposing muscles, to effect which Fig. 339.—Fracture of the femur below the trochanters. Fig. 340.—Fracture of the femur above the condyles. Fig 341.—Fracture of the patella. Seini- incDihranosus Seiiii- tendinosus the limb should be Fig. 342.—Oblique fracture of the placed on a double in- shaft of the tibia, clined plane; or by overcoming the con- traction of the muscles, by continued extension, which may be effected by means of the long splint. Oblique fracture of the femiu- immediately above the condyles (fig. 340) is a formidable injury, and attended with considerable dis- placement. On examination of the limb, the lower fragment may be felt deep in the popliteal space, being drawn backwards by the Gastrocnemius and Plantaris muscles; and upwards by the posterior femoral and Rectus muscles. The pointed end of the upper fragment is drawn inwards by the Pec- tineus and Adductor muscles, and tilted forwards by the Psoas and Iliacus, piercing the Rectus muscle, and occasionally the integument. Relaxation of these muscles, and direct approximation of the broken fragments are effected by placing the limb on a double inclined plane. The greatest care is re- quisite in keeping the pointed extremity of the upper fragment in proper position; otherwise, after union of the fracture, the power of extension of the limb is partially destroyed, from the Rectus muscle being held down by the fractured end of the bone, and from the patella, when elevated, being drawn up- wards against the projecting fragment. In fracture of the ^patella (fig. 341) the fragments are separated by the effusion which takes place into the joint, and possibly by the action of the Quadri- ceps extensor; - the extent of separation of the two fragments depending upon the degree of laceration of the ligamentous structures around the bone. In oblique fracture of the shaft of the tibia (fig. 342), if the fracture has taken place obliquely from above, downwards and forwards, the fragments ride over one another, theSUEGICAL ANATOMY lower fragments being drawn backwards and upwards by the powerful action of the muscles of the calf; the pointed extremity of the upper fragment projects forwards immediately beneath the integument, often protruding through it, and rendering the fracture a compound one. If the direction of the fracture is the reverse of that shown in the figure, the pointed extremity of the lower fragment pro- Fig. 343.-Fracture of the fibula, with disloca- J^^J^ forwards, riding upon the lower tion of the foot outwards-' Pott's Fracture.' f'^^ the upper one. By bendmg the knee, which relaxes the opposmg muscles, and making extension from the ankle and counter-extension at the knee, the fragments may be brought into apposition. It is often necessary, however, in compound fracture, to re- move a portion of the projecting bone with the saw before complete adapta- tion can be effected. Fracture of the fibula tvitli disloca- tion of the foot outivards (fig. 343), commonly known as ' Pott's Fracture,' is one of the most frequent injuries of the ankle-joint. The end of the tibia is displaced from the corresponding surface of the astragalus; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured ; and the inner malleolus projects inwards be- neath the integument, which is tightly stretched over it, and in danger of bin^st- ing. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occasionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly con- nected below ; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the gronnd, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flexing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making extension from the ankle and counter-extension at the knee.OF THE AETEEIES THE Arteries are cylindrical tubular vessels, which serve to convey blood from both ventricles of the heart to every part of the body. These vessels were named arteries (ai^p, air; rrjpelv, to contain), from the belief entertained by the ancients that they contained air. To Galen is due the honour of refuting this opinion ; he showed that these vessels, though for the most part empty after death, contain blood in the living body. The pulmonary artery, which arises from the right ventricle of the heart, carries venous l!)Too^ directly into the lungs, whence rF'^ls"" returned by the pulmonary veins into the left auricle. This constitutes the lesser or pulmonic circulation. TEe""great artery which arises from the left ventricle, the aorta, conveys arterial blood to the body generally ; whence it is brought back to the right side""©? the heart by means of the veins. This constitutes the greater or systemic circulation. ~ The distribution of the systemic arteries is like a highly ramified tree, the common trunk of which, formed by the aorta, commences at the left ventricle of the heart, the smallest ramifications corresponding to the circumference of the body and the contained organs. The arteries are found in nearly every part of the body, with the exception of the hairs, nails, epidermis, cartilages, and corner.; and the larger trunks usually occupy the most protected situations, running, in the limbs, along the flexor side, where they are less exposed to injury. There is considerable variation in the mode of division of the arteries? : occa- sionally a short trunk subdivides into several branches at the same point, as we observe in the coeliac and thyroid axes ; or the vessel may give off several branches in succession, and still continue as the main trunk, as is seen in the arteries of the limbs ; but the usual division is dichotomous, as, for instance, the aorta dividing into the two common iliacs ; and the common carotid into the external and internal. The branches of arteries arise at very variable angles ; some, as the superior intercostal arteries from the aorta, arise at an obtuse angle; others, as the lumbar arteries, at a right angle ; or, as the spermatic, at an acute angle. An artery from which a branch is given off is smaller in size, but retains a uniform diameter until a second branch is derived from it. A branch of an artery is smaller than the trunk from which it arises ; but if an artery divides into two branches, the com- bined area of the two vessels is, in nearly every instance, somewhat greater than that of the trunk; and the combined area of all the arterial branches greatly exceeds the area of the aorta ; so that the arteries collectively may be regarded as a cone, the apex of which corresponds to the aorta ; the base to the capillary system. The arteries, in their distribution, communicate freely with one another, form- ing what is called an anastomosis (avd, hetiveen ; o-rofxa, ?notith), or inosculation : and this communication is very free between the large as well as between the smaller branches. The anastomosis between trunks of equal size is found where great freedom and activity of the circulation are requisite, as in the brain ; here the two vertebral arteries unite to form the basilar, and the two internal carotid arteries are connected by a short communicating trunk ; it is also found in the abdomen, the intestinal arteries having very free anastomoses between their largerAETEEIES 520 branches. In the Hmbs, the anastomoses are most frequent and of largest size around the joints; the branches of an artery above freely inosculating with branches from the vessels below; these anastomoses are of considerable interest to the surgeon, as it is by their enlargement that a collateral circulation is established after the application of a ligature to an artery for the cure of aneurism. The smaller branches of arteries anastomose more frequently than the larger ; and between the smallest twigs these inosculations become so numerous as to constitute a close network that pervades nearly every tissue of the body. Throughout the body generally, the larger arterial branches pursue a perfectly straight course; but in certain situations they are tortuous ; thus, the facial artery in its course over the face, and the arteries of the lips, are extremely tortuous in their course, to accommodate themselves to the movements of the parts. The uterine arteries are also tortuous, to accommodate themselves to the increase of size which the organ undergoes during pregnancy. Again, the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, previous to their entering the cavity of the skull, describe a series of curves, which are evidently intended to diminish the velocity of the current of blood, by increasing the extent of surface over which it moves, and adding to the amount of impediment which is produced by friction. The arteries are dense in structure, of considerable strength, highly elastic, and, when divided, they preserve, although empty, their cylindrical form. The minute structure of these vessels has been described in the chapter on General Anatomy. In the description of the arteries, we shall first consider the efferent trunk of the pulmonic circulation, the pulmonary artery ; and then the efferent trunk of the systemic circulation, the aorta, and its branches. PULMONAEY AkTERY (fig. 344) The pulmonary artery conveys the venous blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. It is a short, wide vessel, about two inches in length, arising from the left side of the base of the right ventricle, in front of the aorta. It passes obliquely upwards and backwards, passing at first in front of and then to the left of the ascending part of the arch of the aorta, as far as the under surface of the transverse portion of the arch, where it divides into two branches of nearly equal size, the right and left pulmonary arteries. Relations.—The whole of this vessel is contained, together with the ascending part of the arch of the aorta, in the pericardium, being enclosed with it in a tube of serous membrane, continued upwards from the base of the heart, and has attached to it, above, the fibrous layer of the membrane. Behind, it rests at first upon the ascending aorta, and higher up lies in front of the left auricle. On each side of its origin is the appendix of the corresponding auricle and a coronary artery ; and higher up it passes to the left side of the ascending aorta. The right pulmonary artery, longer and larger than the left, pierces the peri- cardium and runs horizontally outwards, behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava, to the root of the right lung, where it divides into two branches, of which the lower, which is the smaller, supplies the lower lobe; the upper supplies the upper lobe, giving a branch to the middle lobe. The left pulmonary artery, shorter and somewhat smaller than the right, pierces the pericardium and passes horizontally in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. The root of the left pulmonary artery is connected to the under surface of the arch of the aorta by a short fibrous cord, the remains of a vessel peculiar to foetal life, the ductus arteriosus. The terminal branches of the pulmonary artery will be described with the anatomy of the lung.I ' AECH OF AORTA 521 The Aorta The aorta {dopry, drteria magna) is the main trunk of a series of vessels which convey the oxygenated blood to every part of the body for its nutrition. This vessel commences at the upper part of the left ventricle, and after ascending for a short distance, arches backwards to the left side, over the root of the left lung, then descends within the thorax on the left side of the vertebral column, passes through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and, entering the abdominal cavity, terminates, considerably diminished in size, opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra, Fig. 344.—The arch of the aorta and its branches. where it divides into the right and left^ common iliac arteries. Hence its division into the ascending aorta, the arch of the aorta, and the descending aorta, which last is again divided into thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta, from the position of these parts. Ascending Aorta The ascending aorta is about two inches in length. It commences at the upper part of the left ventricle, on a level with the lower border of the third costal cartilage behind the left half of the sternum ; it passes obliquely upwards, forwards, and to the right in the direction of the heart's axis, as high as the upper border ofAETERIES 522 the second right costal cartilage, describing a slight curve in its course, and being situated, when distended, about a quarter of an inch behind the posterior surface of the sternum. A little above its commencement, it is somewhat enlarged, and presents three small dilatations, called the sinuses of the aorta (sinuses of Valsalva), opposite to which are attached the three semilunar valves, which serve the purpose of preventing any regurgitation of blood into the cavity of the ventricle. A section of the aorta opposite this part has a somewhat triangular figure ; but below the attachment of the valves it is circular. This portion of the aorta is contained in the cavity of the pericardium, and, together with the pulmonary artery, is invested in a tube of serous membrane, continued on to them from the surface of the heart. Relations.—The ascending aorta is covered at its commencement by the trunk of the pulmonary artery and the right auricular appendix, and, higher up, is separated from the sternum by the pericardium, the right pleura, and anterior margin of right lung, some loose areolar tissue, and the remains of the thymus gland ; behind, it rests upon the root of the right lung and left auricle. On the right side, it is in relation with the superior vena cava and right auricle ; on the left side, with the pulmonary artery. PiiAN OF THE Relations of the Ascending Aorta In front.

It passes forwards between the pulmonary artery and the right auricular appendix, then runs obliquely to the right side, in the groove between the right auricle and ventricle, and curving around the right border of the heart, runs along its posterior surface as far as the posterior interventricular groove, where it divides into two branches, one of which continues onwards in the groove betAveen the left auricle and ventricle, and anastomoses with the left coronary; the other descends along the posterior interventricular furrow, supplying branches to both ventricles and to the septum, and anastomosing at the apex of the heart with the descending branches of the left coronary. This vessel sends a large branch along the thin margin of the right ventricle to the apex, and numerous small branches to the right auricle and ventricle, and the commencement of the pulmonary artery. The Left Coronary, larger than the former, arises immediately above the free edge of the left semilunar valve, a little higher than ,tM,right; it passes forwards IbetAvoen the pulmonary artery and the left auricular appendix, and divides intoARCH OF AORTA 523 two branches. Of these, one passes transversely outwards in the left auriculo- ventricular groove, and winds around the left border of the heart to its posterior surface, where it anastomoses with the transverse branch of the right coronary ; the other descends along the anterior interventricular groove to the apex of the heart, where it anastomoses with the descending branches of the right coronary. The left coronary supplies the left auricle and its appendix, both ventricles, and numerous small branches to the pulmonary artery, and commencement of the aorta.* Peculiarities.—These vessels occasionally arise by a common trunk, or their number may be increased to three ; the additional branch being of small size. More rarely, there are two additional branches. Arch of the Aokta The arch, or transverse aorta, commences at the upper border of the second chondro-sternal articulation of the right side, and passes from right to left, and from before backwards, to the left side of the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra behind. Its upper border is usually about an inch below the upper margin of the sternum. Relations.—Its anterior surface is covered by the pleurae and lungs and the remains of the thymus gland, and crossed towards the left side by the left pneumo- gastric and phrenic nerves, and superior cardiac branches of the left sympathetic, and by the left superior intercostal vein. Its jmsterior surface lies on the trachea, just above its bifurcation, on the great, or deep, cardiac plexus, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Its upi^er border is in relation with the left innominate vein ; and from its upper part are given off the innominate, left.common carotid, and left subclavian arteries. Its lower border is in relation with the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, the remains of the ductus arteriosus, which is connected with the left division of that vessel, and the superficial cardiac plexus ; the left recurrent laryngeal nerve winds round it from before backwards, whilst the left bronchus passes below it.

Peculiarities.—The height to which the aorta rises in the chest is usually about an inch below the upper border of the sternum ; biit it may ascend nearly to the top of that bone. Occasionally it is found an inch and a half, more rarely two or even three inches below this point. In Dii^ection.—Sometimes the aorta arches over the root of the right instead of the left * According to Dr. Samuel West, there is a very free and complete anastomosis between the two coronary arteries {Lancet, June 2, 1883, p. 945). This, however, is not the view generally held by anatomists, for, with the exception of the anastomosis men- tioned above in the auriculo-ventricular and interventricular grooves, it is believed that the two arteries only communicate by very small vessels in the substance of the heart.

In such cases all the viscera of the thoracic and abdominal cavities are transposed. Less frequently, the aorta, after arching over the root of the right lung, is directed to its usual position on the left side of the spine, this peculiarity not being accompanied by any transposition of the viscera. In Conformation.—The aorta occasionally divides, as in some quadrupeds, into an ascending and a descending trunk, the former of which is directed vertically upwards, and .subdivides into three branches, to supply the head and upper extremities. Sometimes the aorta subdivides soon after its origin into two branches, which soon reunite. In one of these cases, the oesophagus and trachea were found to pass through the interval left by their division ; this is the normal condition of the vessel in the reptilia. Surgical Anatomy.—Of all the vessels of the arterial system, the aorta, and more especially its arch, is most frequently the seat of disease ; hence it is important to consider some of the consequences that may ensue from aneurism of this part. It will be remembered that the ascending aorta is contained in the pericardium, just behind the sternum, being crossed at its commencement by the pulmonary artery and right auricular appendix, and having the root of the right lung behind, the vena cava on the right side, and the pulmonary artery and left auricle on the left side. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, in the situation of the aortic sinuses, in the great Fig 346.—Kelation of great vessels at base of heart, seen from above.

Left com^m.on^ ocoyotvd. majority of cases, affects the right anterior sinus; this is mainly owing to the fact that the regurgitation of blood upon the sinuses takes place chiefly on the right anterior aspect of the vessel. As the aneurismal sac enlarges, it may compress any or all of the structures in immediate proximity with it, but chiefly projects towards the right anterior side ; and, consequently, interferes mainly with those structures that have a corresponding relation with the vessel. In the majority of cases, it bursts into the cavity of the pericardium, the patient suddenly drops down dead, and, upon a post-mortem examination, the pericardial sac is found full of blood; or it may compress the right auricle, or the pulmonary artery, and adjoining part of the right ventricle, and open into one or the other of these parts, or may press upon the superior vena cava. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, originating above the sinuses, most frequently impli- cates the right anterior wall of the vessel; this is probably mainly owing to the blood being impelled against this part. The direction of the aneurism is also chiefly towards the right of the median line. If it attains a large size and projects forwards, it may absorb the sternum and the cartilages of the ribs, usually on the right side, and appear as a pulsating tumour on the front of the chest, just below the manubrium ; or it may burst into the pericardium, or may compress, or open into the right lung, the trachea, bronchi, or cesophagus. Regarding the transverse aorta, the student is reminded that the vessel lies on the trachea,^ the oesophagus, and thoracic duct; that the recurrent laryngeal nerve winds aroimd it; and that from its upper part are given off three large trunks, which supply the head, neck, and ujDper extremities. Now, an aneurismal tumour taking origin from the posterior part or right aspect of the vessel, its most usual site, may press upon the trachea, impede the breathing, or produce cough, haemoptysis, or stridulous breathing, or it may ultimately burst into that tube, producing fatal hemorrhage. Again, its pressure on the laryngeal nerves may give rise to symptoms which so accurately resemble those ofARCH OF AORTA 525 laryngitis, that the operation of tracheotomy has in some cases been resorted to, from the supposition that disease existed in the larynx; or it may press upon the thoracic duct and destroy life by inanition ; or it may involve the oesophagus, producing dysphagia; or may burst into the oesophagus, when fatal haemorrhage will occur. Again, the innominate artery, or the subclavian, or left carotid, may be so obstructed by clots, as to produce a weakness, or even a disappearance, of the pulse in one or the other wrist, or in the left temporal artery; or the tumour may present itself at or above the manubrium, generally either in the median line, or to the right of the sternum, and may simulate an aneurism of one of the arteries of the neck. Beanches of the Arch of the Aorta (ligs. 344, 345) The branches given off from the arch of the aorta are three in number: the innominate artery, the left common carotid, and the left subclavian. Pecidiarities. Position of the Branches.—The branches, instead of arising from the highest part of the arch (their usual position), may be moved more to the right, arising from the commencement of the transverse or upper part of the ascending portion ; or the distance from one another at their origin may be increased or diminished, the most frequent change in this respect being the approximation of the left carotid towards the innominate artery. The Number of the primary branches may be reduced to two : the left carotid arising from the innominate artery ; or (more rarely), the carotid and subclavian arteries of the left side arising from a left innominate artery. But the number may be increased to four, from the right carotid and subclavian arteries arising directly from the aorta, the innomi- nate being absent. In most of these latter cases, the right subclavian has been found to arise from the left end of the arch; in other cases, it was the second or third branch given ofl instead of the first. Lastly, the number of trunks from the arch may be increased to five or six ; in these instances, the external and internal carotids arise separately from the arch, the common carotid being absent on one or both sides. Nuviber usual, Arrangement different.—When the aorta arches over to the right side, the three branches have an arrangement the reverse of what is usual, the innominate supplymg the left side, and the carotid and subclavian (which arise separately) the right side. In other cases, where the aorta takes its usual course, the two carotids may be joined'in a common trunk, and the subclavians arise separately from the arch, the right subclavian generally arising from the left end of the arch. Secondary Branches sometimes arise from the arch; most commonly such a secondary branch is the left vertebral, which usually takes origin between the left carotid and left subclavian, or beyond them. Sometimes, a thyroid branch is derived from the arch, or the right internal mammary, or right vertebral, or, more rarely, both vertebral.* Innominate Artery The innominate artery (brachio-cephalic) is the largest branch given off from the arch of the aorta. It arises opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra from the commencement of the arch of the aorta in front of the left carotid, and, ascending obliquely to the upper border of the right sterno-clavicular articulation, divides into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. This vessel varies from an inch and a half to two inches in length. Relations.—In front, it is separated from the first bone of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the remains of the thymus gland, the left innominate and right inferior thyroid veins which cross its root, and some- times the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the right pneumogastric. Behind, it lies upon the trachea, which it crosses obliquely. On the right side is the right innominate vein, right pneumogastric nerve, and the pleura ; and on the left side, the remains of the thymus gland, the origin of the left carotid artery, the left inferior thyroid vein, and the trachea. Branches.—The innominate usually gives off" no branches ; but occasionally a small branch, the thyroidea ima, is given off from this vessel. It also sometimes gives oft' a thymic or bronchial branch. The Thyroidea ima ascends in front of the trachea to the lower part of the thyroid body, which it supplies. It varies greatly in size, and appears to compensate for deficiency or absence of one of the other thyroid vessels. It occasionally is found to arise from the subclavian or internal mammary vessel. * The anomalies of the aorta and its branches are minutely described by Krause in Henle's Anatomy (Brunswick, 1868), vol. iii. p. 203 et seq.ARTERIES 526 Plan of the Relations of the Innominate Arteey In f ront.

Peculiarities in point of Division.—When the bifurcation of the innominate artery varies from the point above mentioned, it sometimes ascends a considerable distance above the sternal end of the clavicle ; less frequently it divides below it. In the former class of cases, its length may exceed two inches ; and, in the latter, be reduced to an inch or less. These are points of considerable interest for the surgeon to remember in connection with the operation of tying this vessel. Position.—^Yieii the aorta arches over to the right side, the innominate is directed to the left side of the neck instead of the right. Collateral Circulation.—Allan Burns demonstrated, on the dead subject, the possibility of the establishment of the collateral circulation after ligature of the innominate artery, by tying and dividing that artery, after which, he saj'S, ' Even coarse injection, impelled into the aorta, passing freely by the anastomosing branches into the arteries of the right arm, filling them and all the vessels of the head completely.' {Surgical Anatomy of the Head a7id Neck., p. 62.) The branches by which this circulation would be carried on are very numerous; thus, all the communications across the middle line between the branches of the carotid arteries of opposite sides would be available for the supply of blood to the right side of the head and neck; while the anastomosis between the superior intercostal of the subclavian and the first aortic intercostal (see infra on the collateral circula- tion after obliteration of the thoracic aorta) would bring the blood, by a free and direct course, into the right subclavian : the numerous connections, also, between the intercostal arteries and the branches of the axillary and internal mammary arteries would, doubtless, assist in the supply of blood to the right arm, while the epigastric, from the external iliac, would, by means of its anastomosis with the internal mammary, compensate for any deficiency in the vascularity of the wall of the chest. Surgical Anatomy.—Although the operation of tying the innominate artery has been performed by several surgeons, for aneurism of the right subclavian extending inwards as far as the Scalenus, in only two instances has the patient survived.* Mott's patient, how- ever, on whom the operation was first performed, lived nearly four weeks, and Graefe's more than two months. The main obstacles to the operation are, as the student will perceive from his dissection of this vessel, the deep situation of the artery behind and beneath the sternum, and the number of important structures which surround it in every part. In order to apply a ligature to this vessel, the patient is to be placed upon his back, with the thorax slightly raised, the head bent a little backwards, and the shoulder on the side of the aneurism strongly depressed, so as to draw out the artery from behind the sternum into the neck. An incision three or more inches long is then made along the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, terminating at the sternal end of the clavicle. From this point, a second incision is carried about the same length along the upper border of the clavicle. The skin is then dissected back, and the Platysma divided on a director : the sternal end of the Sterno-mastoid is now brought into view, and a director being passed beneath it, and close to its under surface, so as to avoid any small vessels, it is to be divided; in like manner the clavicular origin is to be divided throughout the whole or greater part of its attachment. By pressing aside any loose cellular tissue or vessels that may now appear, the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles will be exposed, and must be divided, a director being previously passed beneath them. The inferior thyroid veins may come into view, and must be carefully drawn either upwards or downwards, by means of a blunt hook, or tied with double ligatures and divided. After tearing through a * In one of these the operation was performed by Dr. Smyth of New Orleans. See the New Sydenham Society's Biennial Betrospect for 1865-6, p. 346. In the other, the operation was performed by Dr. Mitchell Banks, in the Liverpool Infirmary. The case is recorded by Mr. Jacobson in Op)erations of Surgery, p. 536. Innominate Artery. Left side.

The left innominate vein should now be depressed; the right innominate vein, the internal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric nerve drawn to the right side ; and a curved aneurism needle may then be passed around the vessel, close to its surface, and in a direction from below upwards and inwards ; care being taken to avoid the right pleural sac, the trachea, and cardiac nerves. The ligature should be applied to the artery as high as possible, in order to allow room between it and the aorta for the formation of the coagulum. The importance of avoiding the thyroid plexus of veins during the primary steps of the operation, and the pleural sac whilst including the vessel in the ligature, should be most carefully borne in mind. The most frequent cause of death after operation is secondary haemorrhage, which has occurred in almost every case. Other causes are pleurisy, pericarditis, and suppurative cellulitis. Common Carotid Arteries The common carotid arteries, although occupying a nearly similar position in the neck, differ in position, and, consequently, in their relations at their origin. The right carotid arises from the innominate artery, behind the right sterno- clavicular articulation; the left from the highest part of the arch of the aorta. The left carotid is, consequently, longer, and at its origin is contained within the thorax. The course and relations of that portion of the left carotid which inter- venes between the arch of the aorta and the left sterno-clavicular articulation, will first be described (see fig. 344). The left carotid within the thorax ascends obliquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the root of the neck. In front, it is separated from the first piece of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the left innominate vein, and the remains of the thymus gland; behind, it lies on the trachea, oeso- phagus, and thoracic duct. Internally, it is in relation with the innominate artery, inferior thyroid veins and remains of Thymus gland ; externally, with the left pneumogastric nerve, left pleura, and lung. The left subclavian artery is posterior and external to it. Plan of the Relations of the Left Common Carotid. Thoracic Portion In front. Sternum. Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles.

Each vessel passes obliquely upwards, from behind the sterno-clavicular articulation, to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the third cervical vertebra, where it divides into the external and internal carotid; these names being derived from the distribution of the arteries to the external parts of the head and face, and to the internal parts of the cranium and orbit respectively. At the lower part of the neck the two common carotid arteries are separated from each other by a very small interval, which contains the trachea ; but at the upper part, the thyroid body, the larynx and pharynx project forwards between the two vessels, and give the appearance of their being placed further back in thatARTERIES situation. The common carotid artery is contained in a sheath, derived from the deep cervical fascia, which also encloses the internal jugular vein and pneumo- gastric nerve, the vein lying on the outer side of the artery, and the nerve between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. On opening the sheath, these three structures are seen to be separated from one another, each being enclosed in a separate fibrous investment. Relations.—At the lower part of the neck the common carotid artery is very Fig. 347.—Surgical anatomy of the arteries of the neck. Eij^ht side. deeply seated, being covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep cervical fascia, the Sterno-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles, and by the Omo-hyoid, opposite the cricoid cartilage ; but in the upper part of its course, near its termination, it is more superficial, being covered merely by the integument, the superficial fascia, Platysma, deep cervical fascia, and inner margin of the Sterno-mastoid, and is contained in a triangular space, bounded behind by the Sterno-mastoid, above by the posterior belly of the Digastric, and below byCOMMON CAROTID 529 the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoicl. This part of the artery is crossed obliquely, from within outwards, by the sterno-mastoid artery ; it is crossed also by one, or sometimes two superior thyroid veins, which terminate in the internal jugular; and descending on its sheath in front is seen the descendens hypoglossi nerve, this filament being joined by one or two branches from the cervical nerves, which cross the vessel from without inwards. Sometimes the descendens hypoglossi is con- tained within the sheath. The middle thyroid vein crosses the artery about its middle, and the anterior jugular vein below. Behind, the artery lies in front of the cervical portion of the spine, resting first on the Longus colli muscle, then on the Rectus capitis anticus major, from which it is separated by the sympathetic nerve. The recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior thyroid artery cross behind the vessel at its lower part. Internally, it is in relation with the trachea and thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve being interposed : higher up, with the larynx and pharynx. On its outer side are placed the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve. At the lower part of the neck, the internal jugular vein on the right side diverges from the artery, but on the left side it approaches it, and often crosses its lower part. This is an important fact to bear in mind during the performance of any operation on the lower part of the left common carotid artery.

This variation occurs in one out of about eight cases and a half, and the origin is more frequently above than below the usual point: or the artery may arise as a separate branch from the arch of the aorta, or in conjunction with the left carotid. The left common carotid varies more frequently in its origin than the right. In the majority of abnormal cases it arises with the innominate artery, or, if the innominate artery is absent, the two carotids arise usually by a single trunk. The left carotid is occasionally the first branch given off from the arch of the aorta. It rarely joins with the left subclavian, except in cases of transposition of the arch. Pecu liarities as to Point of Division.—The most important peculiarities of this vessel, in a surgical point of view, relate to its place of division in the neck. In the majority of abnormal cases, this occurs higher than usual, the artery dividing into two branches opposite the hyoid bone, or even higher; more rarely, it occurs below its usual place opposite the middle of the larynx, or the lower border of the cricoid cartilage; and one case is related by Morgagni, where the common carotid, only an inch and a half in length, divided at the root of the neck. Very rarely, the common carotid ascends in the neck without any subdivision, the internal carotid being wanting; and in a few cases the common carotid has been found to be absent, the external and mternal carotids arising directly from the arch of the aorta. This peculiarity existed on both sides in some instances, on one side in others. Occasional Branches.—The common carotid usually gives off no branch previous to its bifurcation; but it occasionally gives origin to the superior thyroid, or its laryngeal branch, the inferior thyroid, or, more rarely, the vertebral artery. M M530 ARTEEIES Surface Marking.—The carotid arteries are overlapi^ed throughout their entire extent by the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, but their course does not correspond to the border of the muscle, which passes in a somewhat curved direction from the mastoid process to the sterno-clavicular joint. The course of the artery is indicated more exactly by a line drawn from the sternal end of the clavicle below, to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process above. That portion of the line below the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage would represent the course of the vessel. Surgical A^iatomy.— The operation of tjdng the common carotid artery may be necessary in a case of wound of that vessel or its branches, in aneurism, or in a case of pulsating tumour of the orbit or skull. If the wound involves the trunk of the common carotid, it will be necessary to tie the artery above and below the wounded part. But in cases of aneurism, or where one of the branches of the common carotid is wounded in an inaccessible situation, it may be judged necessary to tie the trunk. In such cases, the whole of the artery is accessible, and any part may be tied, except close to either end. "When the case is such as to allow of a choice being made, the lower part of the carotid should never be selected as the spot upon which to place a ligature, for not only is the artery in this situation placed very deeply in the neck, but it is covered by three layers of muscles, and, on the left side, the internal jugular vein, in the great majority of cases, passes obhquely in front of it. Neither should the upper end be selected, for here the superior thyroid Vein and its tributaries would give rise to very considerable difficulty in the appli- cation of a ligature. The point most favourable for the operation is that part of the vessel which is at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It occasionally happens that the carotid artery bifurcates below its usual position: if the artery be exposed at its point of bifurca- tion, both divisions of the vessel should be tied near their origin, in preference to tying the trunk of the artery near its termination ; and if, in consequence of the entire absence of the common carotid, or from its early division, two arteries, the external and internal carotids, are met with, the ligature should be placed on that vessel which is found on com- pression to be connected with the disease. In this operation, the direction of the vessel and the inner margin of the Sterno-mastoid are the chief guides to its performance. The patient should be placed on his back with the head thrown back and turned slightly to the opposite side : an incision is to be made, three inches long, in the direction of the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, so that the centre corresponds to the level of the cricoid cartilage : after dividing the integument, superficial fascia, and Platysma, the deep fascia must be cut through on a director, so as to avoid wounding numerous small veins that are usually found beneath. The head may now be brought forwards so as to relax the parts somewhat, and the margins of the wound held asunder by retractors. The descendens hypoglossi nerve may now be exposed, and must be avoided, and the sheath of the vessel having been raised by forceps, is to be opened to a small extent over the artery at its inner side. The internal jugular vein may present itself alternately distended and relaxed; this should be compressed both above and below, and drawn outwards, in order to facilitate the operation. The aneurism needle is passed from the outside, care being taken to keep the needle in close contact with the artery, and thus avoid the risk of injuring the internal jugular vein, or including the vagus nerve. Before the ligature is tied, it should be ascertained that nothing but the artery is included in it. Ligature of the Common Carotid at the Lower Part of the Neck.—This operation is sometimes required in cases of aneurism of the upper part of the carotid, especially if the sac is of large size. It is best performed by dividing the sternal origin of the Sterno- mastoid muscle, but may be done in some cases, if the aneurism is not of very large size, b}^ an incision along the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, extending down to the sterno-clavicular articulation, and by then retracting the muscle. The easiest and best plan, however, is to make an incision two or three inches long down the lower part of the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle to the sterno-clavicular joint, and a second incision, starting from the termination of the first, along the upper border of the clavicle for about two inches. This incision is made through the superficial and deep fascia, and the sternal origin of the muscle exposed. This is to be divided on a director and turned up, with the superficial structures, as a triangular flap. Some loose connective tissue is to be divided or torn through, and the outer border of the Sterno-hyoid muscle exposed. In doing this, care must be taken not to wound the anterior jugular vein, which crosses the muscle to reach the external jugular or subclavian vein. The Sterno-hyoid, and with it the Sterno-thyroid, are to be drawn inwards by means of a retractor, and the sheath of the vessel is exposed. This must be opened with great care on its inner or tracheal side, so as to avoid the internal jugular vein. This is especially necessary on the left side, where the artery is commonly overlapped by the vein. On the right side there is usually an interval between the artery and the vein, and not the same risk of wounding the latter. The common carotid artery, being a long vessel without any branches, is particularly suitable for the performance of Brasdor's operation for the cure of an aneurism of the lower part of the vessel. Brasdor's procedure consists in ligaturing the artery on the distal side of the aneurism, and in the case of the common carotid there are no branches given off from the vessel between the aneurism and the site of the ligature, hence little orEXTEENAL CAROTID 531 no blood passes through the sac of the aneurism, and consequently it and the vessel shrinks, and a cure is effected. Collateral Circulation.—After ligature of the common carotid, the collateral circula- tion can be perfectly established, by the free communication which exists between the carotid arteries of opposite sides, both without and within the cranium, and by enlarge- ment of the branches of the subclavian artery on the side corresponding to that on which the vessel has been tied—the chief communication outside the skull taking place between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, and the profunda cervicis and arteria princeps cervicis of the occipital; the vertebral taking the place of the internal carotid within the cranium. Sir A. Cooper had an opportunity of dissecting, thirteen years after the operation, the case in which he first successfully tied the common carotid (the second case in which he performed the operation).* The injection, however, does not seem to have been a suc- cessful one. It showed merely that the arteries at the base of the brain (circle of Willis) were much enlarged on the side of the tied artery, and that the anastomosis between the branches of the external carotid on the affected side and those of the same artery on the sound side was free, so that the external carotid was pervious throughout. External Carotid Artery The external carotid artery (fig. 347) commences opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and, taking a slightly curved course, passes upwards and for- wards, and then inclines backwards to the space between the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw and the external meatus, where it divides into the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. It rapidly diminishes in size in its course up the neck, owing to the number and large size of the branches given off from it. In the child, it is somewhat smaller than the internal carotid ; but in the adult, the two vessels are of nearly equal size. At its commencement, this artery is more superficial, and placed nearer the middle line than the internal carotid, and is contained in the triangular space bounded by the Sterno-mastoid behind, the Omo-hyoid. below, and the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid above. Relations.—It is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, Platysma, deep fascia, and anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid, crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, and by the lingual and facial veins ; it is afterwards crossed by the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and higher up passes deeply into the substance of the parotid gland, where it lies beneath the facial nerve and the junction of the temporal and internal maxillary veins. Internally is the hyoid bone, wall of the pharynx, the superior laryngeal nerve, and the ramus of the jaw, from which it is separated by a portion of the parotid gland. Externally, in the lower part of its course, is the internal carotid artery. Behind it, near its origin, is the superior laryngeal nerve ; and higher up, it is separated from the internal carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus muscles, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and part of the parotid gland. Surface Marhing.—The position of the external carotid artery may be marked out with sufficient accuracy by a line drawn from the front of the meatus of the external ear to the side of the cricoid cartilage, slightly arching the line forwards. Surgical Anatomy.—The application of a ligature to the external carotid may be required in cases of wounds of this vessel, or of its branches when these cannot be tied, and in some cases of pulsating tumour of the scalp or face. The operation has not received the attention which it deserves, owing to the fear which surgeons have entertained of secondary haemorrhage, on account of the number of branches given off from the vessel. This fear, however, has been shown by Mr. Cripps not to be well founded.t To tie this vessel near its origin, below the point where it is crossed by the Digastric, an incision about three inches in length should be made along the margin of the Sterno-mastoid, from the angle of the jaw to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The ligature should be applied between the lingual and superior thyroid branches. To tie the vessel above the Digastric, between it and the parotid gland, an incision should be made, from the lobe of the ear to the great cornu of the os hyoides dividing successively the skin, Platysma, and fascia. By drawing the Sterno-mastoid outwards, and the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles downwards, and separating them from the parotid gland, the vessel will be exposed, and a ligature may be applied to it.

The student is here reminded that many variations are met with in the number, origin, and course of these branches in different subjects ; but the above arrangement is that w^hich is found in the great majority of cases. The Superior Thyroid Artery (figs. 347 and 352) is the first branch given off from the external carotid, being derived from that vessel just below the great cornu of the hyoid bone. At its commencement, it is quite superficial, being covered by the integument, fascia, and Platysma, and is contained in the triangular space bounded by the Sterno-mastoid, Digastric, and Omo-hyoid muscles. After running upwards and inwards for a'short distance, it curves downwards and forwards, in an arched and tortuous manner, to the upper part of the thyroid gland, passing beneath the Omo-hyoid, Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles ; and distributes numerous branches to the anterior surface of the gland, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. Besides the arteries distributed to the muscles by which it is covered and the substance of the gland, the branches of the superior thyroid are the following : — Hyoid. Superior Laryngeal. Superficial descending branch (Sterno-mastoid). Crico-thyroid. The hyoid is a small branch Avhich runs along the lower border of the os hyoides beneath the Thyro-hyoid muscle; after supplying the muscles connected to that bone, it forms an arch, by anastomosing with the vessels of the opposite side. The superficial descending^ branch runs downwards and outwards across the sheath of the common carotid artery, and supplies the Sterno-mastoid and neigh-533 LINGUAL bonring muscles and integument. There is also often a distinct branch from the external carotid distributed to the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The superior laryngeal, larger than either of the preceding, accompanies the superior laryngeal nerve, beneath the Thyro-hyoid muscle ; it pierces the thyro- hyoid membrane, and supplies the muscles, mucous membrane, and glands of the larynx, anastomosing with the branch from the opposite side. The crico-thyroid is a small branch which runs transversely across the crico- thyroid membrane, communicating with the artery of the opposite side. Surgical Anatomy.—The superior thyroid, or some of its branches, is often divided in cases of cut throat, giving rise to considerable haemorrhage. In such cases, the artery should be secured, the wound being enlarged for that purpose, if necessary. The opera- tion may be easily performed, the position of the artery being very superficial, and the only structures of importance covering it being a few small veins. The operation of tying the superior thyroid artery, in bronchocele, has been performed in numerous instances with partial or temporary success. When, however, the collateral circulation between this vessel and the artery of the opposite side, and the inferior thyroid, is completely re-established, the tumour usually regains its former size. The position of the superficial descending branch is of importance in connection with the operation of ligature of the common carotid artery. It crosses and lies on the sheath of this vessel and may chance to be wounded in opening the sheath. The position of the crico-thyroid branch should be remembered, as it may prove the source of troublesome haemorrhage during the operation of laryngotomy. The Lingual Artery (fig. 352) arises from the external carotid between the superior thyroid and facial; it runs obliquely upwards and inwards to the great cornu of the hyoid bone, then passes horizontally forwards parallel with the great cornu, and, ascending perpendicularly to the under surface of the tongue, turns forwards on its under surface as far as the tip of that organ, under the name of the rmiine artery. Relations.—Its first, or oblique, portion is superficial, being contained in the triangular space already described, resting upon the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and covered by the Platysma, and fascia of the neck. Its second, or horizontal, portion also lies upon the Middle constrictor, being covered at first by the tendon of the Digastric and the Stylo-hyoid muscle, and afterwards by the Hyo-glossus, the latter muscle separating it from the hypoglossal nerve. Its third, or ascending, portion lies between the Hyo-glossus and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. The fourth, or terminal, part, under the name of the ranine, runs along the under surface of the tongue to its tip : it is very superficial, being covered only by the mucous membrane, and rests on the Lingualis on the outer side of the Genio-hyo-glossus. The hypoglossal nerve crosses the lingual artery, and then becomes separated from it, in the second part of its course, by the Hyo-glossus muscle. The branches of the lingual artery are, the The hyoid branch runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone, supplying the muscles attached to it and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The dorsalis linguae (fig. 352) arises from the lingual artery beneath the Hyo- glossus muscle (which, in the figure, has been partly cut away, to show the vessel) ; ascending to the dorsum of the tongue, it supplies the mucous membrane, the tonsil, soft palate, and epiglottis; anastomosing with its fellow from the opposite side. The sublingual, which may be described as a branch of bifurcation of the lingual artery, arises at the anterior margin of the Hyo-glossus muscle, and runs forwards between the Genio-hyo-glossus and the sublingual gland. It supplies the substance of the gland, giving branches to the Mylo-hyoid and neighbouring muscles, the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. One branch runs behind the alveolar process of the lower jaw in the substance of the gum to anastomose with a similar artery from the other side. Hyoid. Dorsalis Linguae. Sublingual. Ranine.AKTERIES 534 The ranine may be regarded as the other branch of bifurcation, or, as is more usual, as the continuation of the lingual artery ; it runs along the under surface of the tongue, resting on the Inferior lingualis, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth ; it lies on the outer side of the Genio-hyo-giossus, accompanied by the lingual nerve. On arriving at the tip of the tongue, it has been said to anastomose with the artery of the opposite side ; but this is denied by Hyrtl. These vessels in the mouth are placed one on each side of the frgenum. Surgical Anatomy.—The lingual artery may be divided near its origin in eases of cut throat, a complication that not unfrequently happens in this class of wounds ; or severe haemorrhage which cannot be restrained by ordinary means, may ensue from a womid, or deep ulcer, of the tongue. In the former case, the primary wound may be enlarged if necessary, and the bleeding vessel secm^ed. In the latter case, it has been suggested that the lingual artery should be tied near its origin. Ligature of the lingual artery is also occasionally practised, as a palliative measure, in cases of cancer of the tongue, in order to check the progress of the disease by starving the growth, and it is sometimes tied, as a preliminary measure to removal of the tongue. The operation is a ditticult one, on account of the depth of the artery, the number of important parts by which it is sur- rounded, the loose and yielding nature of the parts upon which it is supported, and its occasional irregularity of origin. An incision is to be made in a curved direction from a finger's breadth external to the symphysis of the jaw downwards to the cornu of the hyoid bone, and then upwards to near the angle of the jaw. Care must be taken not to carry this incision too far backwards, for fear of endangering the facial vein. In the first incision the skin, superficial fascia, and Platysma will be divided, and the deep fascia exposed. This is then to be incised and the submaxillary gland exposed and pulled upwards by retractors. A. triangular space is now exposed, bounded internally by the posterior border of the Mylo-hyoid muscle ; below and externally, by the tendon of the Digastric ; and above, by the hypoglossal nerve. The floor of the space is formed by the Hyo-glossus muscle, l3eneath which the artery lies. The fibres of this muscle are now to be cut through horizontally, and the vessel exposed, care being taken, while near the vessel, not to open the pharynx. Troublesome haemorrhage may occur in the division of the fraenum in children, if the ranine artery, which lies on each side of it, is wounded. The student should remember that the operation is always to be performed with a pair of blunt-pointed scissors, and the mucous membrane only is to be divided by a very superficial cut, which cannot endanger any vessel. The scissors, also, should be directed away from the tongue. Any fiirther liberation of the tongue which may be necessary can be effected by tearing. The Facial Artery (fig. 349) arises a little above the lingual, and passes obliquely upwards, beneath the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles; it then runs forwards under cover of the body of the lower jaw, lodged in a groove on the posterior surface of the submaxillary gland; this may be called the cervical part of the artery. It then curves upwards over the body of the jaw at the anterior inferior angle of the Masseter muscle ; passes forwards and upwards across the cheek to the angle of the mouth, then upwards along the side of the nose, and terminates at the inner canthus of the eye, under the name of the angular artery. This vessel, both in the neck and on the face, is remarkably tortuous : in the former situation, to accommodate itself to the movements of the pharynx in deglutition ; and in the latter, to the movements of the jaw, and the lips and cheeks. Relations.—In the neck, its origin is superficial, being covered by the integument, Platysma, and fascia; it then passes beneath the Digastric and Stylo- hyoid muscles, and the submaxillary gland. On the face, where it passes over the body of the lower jaw, it is comparatively superficial, lying immediately beneath the Platysma. In this situation its pulsation may be distinctly felt, and com- pression of the vessel effectually made against the bone. In its course over the face, it is covered by the integument, the fat of the cheek, and, near the angle of the mouth, by the Platysma, Eisorius, and Zygomatic muscles. It rests on the Buccinator, the Levator anguli oris, and the Levator labii superioris (sometimes piercing or else passing under this last muscle). It is accompanied by the facial vein throughout its entire course ; the vein is not tortuous like the artery, and, on the face, is separated from that vessel by a considerable interval, lying to its outer side. The branches of the facial nerve cross the artery, and the infra-orbital nerve lies beneath it.535 FACIAL The branches of this vessel may be divided into two sets : those given off below the jaw (cervical), and those on the face (facial). Cervical Brandies. Inferior or Ascending Palatine. Tonsillar. Submaxillary. Submental. Muscular. Facial Branches. Muscular. Inferior Labial. Inferior Coronary. Superior Coronary. Lateralis Nasi. Angular. The inferior or ascending palatine (fig. 352) passes up between the Stylo- glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus to the outer side of the pharynx. After supplying Fig. 349.—The arteries of the face and scalp.* Lateralis nasi Arteria septi nasi Superior coronary Inferior coronary Inferior labial these muscles, the tonsil, and Eustachian tube, it divides, near the Levator palati, into two branches : one follows the course of the Levator palati, and, winding over the upper border of the Superior constrictor, supplies the soft palate and the palatine glands; the other pierces the Superior constrictor, supplies the tonsil, anastomosing with the tonsillar artery. These vessels also anastomose with the j)osterior palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery. The tonsillar branch (fig. 352) passes up between the Internal Pterygoid and Stylo-glossus, and then ascends along the side of the pharynx, perforating the Superior constrictor, to ramify in the substance of the tonsil and root of the tongue. * The muscular tissue of the lips must be supposed to have been cut away, in order to show the course of the coronary arteries.536 AKTEEIES The submaxillary consist of three or four large branches, which supply the submaxillary gland, some being pi:olonged to the neighbouring muscles, lymphatic glands, and integument. The submental, the largest of the cervical branches, is given off from the facial artery just as that vessel quits the submaxillary gland : it runs forwards upon the Mylo-hyoid muscle, just below the body of the jaw, and beneath the Digastric ; after supplying the surrounding muscles, and anastomosing with the sublingual artery by branches which perforate the Mylo-hyoid muscle, it arrives at the symphysis of the chin, where it turns over the border of the jaw and divides into a superficial and a deep branch ; the former passes between the integument and Depressor labii inferioris, supplies both, and anastomoses with the inferior labial. The deep branch passes between the latter muscle and the bone, supplies the lip, and anastomoses with the inferior labial and mental arteries. The muscular branches are distributed to the Internal pterygoid and Stylo- hyoid in the neck, and to the Masseter and Buccinator on the face. The inferior labial passes beneath the Depressor anguli oris, to supply the muscles and integument of the lower lip, anastomosing with the inferior coronary and submental branches of the facial, and with the mental branch of the inferior dental artery. The inferior coronary is derived from the facial artery, near the angle of the mouth ; it passes upwards and inwards beneath the Depressor anguli oris, and, penetrating the Orbicularis oris muscle, runs in a tortuous course along the edge of the lower lip between this muscle and the mucous membrane, inosculating with the artery of the opposite side. This artery supplies the labial glands, the mucous membrane, and muscles of the lower lip ; and anastomoses with the inferior labial and the mental branch of the inferior dental artery. The superior coronary is larger and more tortuous in its course than the preceding. It follows the same course along the edge of the upper lip, lying between the mucous membrane and the Orbicularis oris, and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. It supplies the textures of the upper lip, and gives off in its course two or three vessels which ascend to the nose. One, named the inferior artery of the septum, ramifies on the septum of the nares as far as the point of the nose; another, the artery of the ala, supplies the ala of the nose. The lateralis nasi is derived from the facial, as that vessel is ascending along the side of the nose; it supplies the ala and dorsum of the nose, anastomosing with its fellow, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, the inferior artery of the septum, the artery of the ala, and the infra-orbital. The angular artery is the termination of the trunk of the facial; it ascends to the inner angle of the orbit, embedded in the fibres of the Levator labii superi- oris alasque nasi, and accompanied by a large vein, the angular ; it distributes some branches on the cheek which anastomose with the infra-orbital, and, after supplying the lachrymal sac and Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, terminates by anastomosing with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. The anastomoses of the facial artery are very numerous, not only with the vessel of the opposite side, but, in the neck, with the sublingual branch of the lingual; with the ascending pharyngeal; with the posterior palatine, a branch of the internal maxillary, by its inferior or ascending palatine and tonsillar branches ; on the face, with the mental branch of the inferior dental as it emerges from the mental foramen, with the transverse facial, a branch of the temporal; with the infra-orbital, a branch of the internal maxillary, and with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. Peculiarities,—The facial artery not unfrequently arises by a common trunk with the lingual. This vessel is also subject to some variations in its size, and in the extent to which it supplies the face. It occasionally terminates as the submental, and not unfre- quently supplies the face only as high as the angle of the mouth or nose. The deficiency is then supplied by enlargement of one of the neighbouring arteries. Surgical Anatomy.—The passage of the facial artery over the body of the jaw would appear to afford a favourable position for the application of pressure in cases of hsemorrhage537 OCCIPITAL from the lips, the result either of an accidental wound or during an operation; but its application is useless, except for a very short time, on account of the free communication of this vessel with its fellow, and with numerous branches from different sources. In a wound involving the lip, it is better to seize the part between the hngers, and evert it, when the bleeding vessel may be at once secured with pressure-forceps. In order to prevent haemorrhage in cases of removal of diseased growths from the part, the lip should be compressed on each side between the fingers and thumb, or by a pair of specially devised clamp-forceps, whilst the surgeon excises the diseased part. In order to stop haemorrhage where the lip has been divided in an operation, it is necessary, in uniting the edges of the wound, to pass the sutures through the cut edges, almost as deep as its mucous surface; by these means, not only are the cut surfaces more neatlj" and securely adapted to each other, but the possibility of haemorrhage is prevented by including in the suture the divided artery. If the suture is, on the contrary, passed through merely the cutaneous portion of the wound, haemorrhage occurs into the cavity of the mouth. The student should, lastly, observe the relation of the angular artery to the lachrymal sac, and it will be seen that, as the vessel passes up along the inner margin of the orbit, it ascends on its nasal side. In operating for fistula lachrymalis, the sac should always be opened on its outer side, in order that this vessel may be avoided. The Occipital Artery (fig. 349) arises from the posterior part of the external carotid, opposite the facial, near the lower margin of the Digastric muscle. At its origin, it is covered by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and the hypoglossal nerve winds around it from behind forwards ; higher up, it passes across the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the pneumo- gastric and spinal accessory nerves ; it then ascends to the interval between the transverse process of the atlas, and the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and passes horizontally backwards, grooving the surface of the latter bone, being covered by the Sterno-mastoid, Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, and Digastric muscles, and resting upon the Rectus lateralis, the Superior oblique, and Complexus muscles ; it then changes its course and passes vertically upwards, pierces the fascia which connects the cranial attachment of the Trapezius with the Sterno-mastoid, and ascends in a tortuous course over the occiput, as high as the vertex, where it divides into numerous branches. It is accompanied in the latter part of its course by the great ocdpital and a cutaneous filament from the suboccipital nerve. The branches given off from this vessel are,— The muscular branches supply the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, Splenius, and Trachelo-mastoid muscles. The sterno-mastoid is a large and constant branch, generally arising from the artery close to its commencement. It first passes upwards and backwards, and then turns downwards over the hypoglossal nerve, and enters the substance of the muscle, frequently in company with the spinal accessory nerve. The auricular branch supplies the back part of the concha. It frequently gives off a branch, which enters the skull through the mastoid foramen and supplies the dura mater. The meningeal branch ascends with the internal jugular vein, and enters the skull through the foramen lacerum posterius, to supply the dura mater in the posterior fossa. The arteria princeps cervicis (fig. 352) is a large branch which descends along the back part of the neck, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The former runs beneath the Splenius, giving off branches which perforate that muscle to supply the Trapezius, anastomosing with the superficial cervical artery, a branch of the transversalis colli: the latter passes beneath the Complexus, between it and the Semispinalis colli, and anastomoses with branches from the vertebral and with the deep cervical artery, a branch of the superior intercostal. The anastomosis between these vessels serves mainly to establish the collateral circula- tion after ligature of the carotid or subclavian artery. The cranial branches of the occipital artery are distributed upon the occiput ; Muscular. Sterno-mastoid. Auricular. Meningeal. Arteria Princeps Cervicis.538 AETEEIES they are very tortuous, and lie between the integument and Occipito-frontalis, anastomosing with the artery of the opposite side, the posterior auricular and temporal arteries. They supply the back part of the Occipito-frontalis muscle, the integument, and pericranium. The Posterior Auricular Artery (fig. 349) is a small vessel which arises from the external carotid, above the Digastric and Stylo-hyold muscles, opposite the apex of the styloid process. It ascends, under cover of the parotid gland, to the groove between the cartilage of the ear and the mastoid process, immediately above which it divides into two branches : an anterior, auricular, passing forwards to supply the back of the auricle and anastomose with the posterior division of the temporal; and a posterior, mastoid, to the scalp above and behind the ear, communicating with the occipital. Just before arriving at the mastoid process, this artery is crossed by the portio dura, and has beneath it the spinal accessory nerve. Besides several small branches to the Digastric, Stylo-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles, and to the parotid gland, this vessel gives off three branches :— Stylo-mastoid. Auricular. Mastoid. The stylo-mastoid branch enters the stylo-mastoid foramen, and supplies the tympanum, mastoid cells, and semicircular canals. In the young subject a branch from this vessel forms, with the tympanic branch from the internal maxillary, a vascular circle, which surrounds the auditory meatus, and from which delicate vessels ramify on the membrana tympani. It anastomoses with the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery by a twig, which enters the hiatus Fallopii. The auricular branch is distributed to the back part of the cartilage of the ear, upon which it ramifies minutely, some branches curving round the margin of the fibro-cartilage, others perforating it, to supply its anterior surface. It anastomoses with the anterior auricular branches of the temporal. The mastoid branch passes backwards, over the Sterno-mastoid muscle, to the scalp above and behind the ear. It supplies the posterior belly of the Occipito- frontalis muscle and the scalp in this situation. It anastomoses with the occipital artery. The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery (fig. 352), the smallest branch of the external carotid, is a long, slender vessel, deeply seated in the neck, beneath the other branches of the external carotid and the Stylo-pharyngeus muscle. It arises from the back part of the external carotid, near the commencement of that vessel, and ascends vertically between the internal carotid and the side of the pharynx, to the under surface of the base of the skull, lying on the Eectus capitis anticus major. Its branches may be subdivided into three sets :— Prevertebral. Pharyngeal. Meningeal. The prevertebral branches are numerous small vessels, which supply the Recti capitis antici and Longus colli muscles, the sympathetic, hypoglossal, and pneumogastric nerves, and the lymphatic glands of the neck, anastomosing with the ascending cervical artery. The pharyngeal branches are three or four in number. Two of these descend to supply the middle and inferior Constrictors and the Stylo-pharyngeus, ramifying in their substance and in the mucous membrane lining them. The largest of the pharyngeal branches passes inwards, running upon the Superior constrictor, and sends ramifications to the soft palate and tonsil, which take the place of the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery, when that vessel is of small size. A twig from this branch passes up the Eustachian tube to supply the tympanum. The meningeal branches consist of several small vessels, which pass through foramina in the base of the skull, to supply the dura mater. One, the posterior meningeal, enters the cranium through the foramen lacerum posterius ; a second passes through the foramen lacerum medium ; and occasionally a third through the anterior condyloid foramen. They are all distributed to the dura mater.539 INTERNAL MAXILLAEY Surgical Anatomy.—The ascending pharyngeal artery has been wounded from the throat ; as in the case in which the stem of a tobacco-pipe was driven into the vessel, causing fatal haemorrhage. The Superficial Temporal Artery (fig. 349), the smaller of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of that vessel. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, in the interspace between the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw and the external meatus, crosses over the posterior root of the zygoma, passes beneath the Attrahens aurem muscle, and divides, about two inches above the zygomatic arch, into two branches, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior temporal inclines forwards over the forehead, supplying the muscles, integument, and pericranium in this region, and anastomoses wdth the supra-orbital and frontal arteries. The posterior temporal, larger than the anterior, curves upwards and backwards along the side of the head, lying superficial to the temporal fascia, and inosculates with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The superficial temporal artery, as it crosses the zygoma, is covered by the Attrahens aurem muscle, and by a dense fascia given off from the parotid gland : it is also usually crossed by one or two veins, and accompanied by branches of the facial and auriculo-temporal nerves. Besides some twigs to the parotid gland, the articulation of the jaw, and the Masseter muscle, its branches are, the Transverse Facial. Middle Temporal. Anterior Auricular. The transverse facial is given off from the temporal before that vessel quits the parotid gland; running forwards through its substance, it passes transversely across the face, between Stenson's duct and the lower border of the zygoma, and divides on the side of the face into numerous branches, which supply the parotid gland, the Masseter muscle, and the integument, anastomosing with the facial, masseteric, and infra-orbital arteries. This vessel rests on the Masseter, and i accompanied by one or two branches of the facial nerve. It is sometimes a branch of the external carotid. The middle temporal artery arises immediately above the zygomatic arch, and, perforating the temporal fascia, supplies the Temporal muscle, anastomosing with the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillary. It occasionally gives off an orbital branch, which runs along the upper border of the zygoma, between the two layers of the temporal fascia, to the outer angle of the orbit. This branch supplies the Orbicularis palpebrarum, and anastomoses with the lachrymal and palpebral branches of the ophthalmic artery. The anterior auricular branches are distributed to the anterior portion of the pinna, the lobule, and part of the external meatus, anastomosing with branches of the posterior auricular. Surgical Anatomy.—It occasionally happens that the surgeon is called upon to perform the operation of arteriotomy upon this vessel in cases of inflammation of the eye or brain. If the student will consider the relations of the trunk of this vessel, as it crosses the zygomatic arch, with the surrounding structures, he will observe that it is covered by a thick and dense fascia, crossed by one or two veins, and accompanied by branches of the facial and auriculo-temporal nerves. Bleeding should not be performed in this situation, as much difficulty may arise from the dense fascia over the vessel preventing a free flow of blood, and considerable pressure is requisite afterwards to repress the haemorrhage. Again, a varicose aneurism may be formed by the accidental opening of one of the veins in front of the artery; or severe neuralgic pain may arise from the operation implicating one of the nervous filaments in the neighbourhood. The anterior branch, on the contrary, is subcutaneous, is a large vessel, and is readily comj^ressed; it should consequently alwa.ys be selected for the operation. The Internal Maxillary (fig. 350), the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, passes inwards, at right angles from that vessel, to the inner side of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, to supply the deep structures of540 AETERIES the face. At its origin, it is imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland, being on a level with the lower extremity of the lobule of the ear. In the first part of its course {maxillary ijortioii), the artery passes horizontally forwards and inwards, between the ramus of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament. The artery here lies parallel with the auriculo-temporal nerve ; it crosses the inferior dental nerve, and lies along the lower border of the External pterygoid muscle. In the second part of its course [pterygoid portion), it runs obliquely forwards and upwards upon the outer surface of the External pterygoid muscle, being covered by the ramus of the lower jaw, and lower part of the Temporal muscle. In the third part of its course [splieno-maxillary ijortion), it approaches the Fig. 350.—The internal maxillary artery, and its branches. superior maxillary bone, and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa in the interval between the two heads of the External pterygoid, where it Hes in relation with Meckel's ganglion, and gives off its terminal branches. Peculiarities—Oca&^iondlly, this artery passes between the two Pterygoid muscles. The vessel in this case passes forwards to the interval between the processes of origin of the External pterygoid, in order to reach the superior maxillary bone. Sometimes the vessel escapes from beneath the External pterygoid by perforating the middle of that muscle. The branches of this vessel may be divided into three groups, corresponding with its three divisions.541 INTERNAL MAXILLARY Branches of the First or Maxillary Portion (fig. 351) Tympanic (anterior). Small Meningeal. Middle Meningeal. Inferior Dental. The tympanic branch passes upwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw, enters the tympanum through the Glaserian fissure, and ramifies upon the membrana tympani, forming a vascular circle around the membrane with the stylo-mastoid artery, and anastomosing with the Vidian and the tympanic branch from the internal carotid. It gives off an auricular branch to the external meatus, supplying its cuticular lining and the outer surface of the membrana tympani. The middle meningeal is the largest of the branches which supply the dura mater. It arises from the internal maxillary, between the internal lateral ligament and the neck of the jaw, and passes vertically upwards between the two roots of the auriculo-temporal nerve to the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone. On entering the cranium, it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branch, the larger, crosses the great ala of the sphenoid, and reaches the groove, or canal, in the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone : it then divides into branches which spread out between the dura mater and internal surface of the cranium, some passing upwards over the parietal bone as far as the vertex, and others backwards to the occipital bone. The i^osterior branch crosses the squamous portion of the temporal, and on the inner surface of the parietal bone divides into branches which supply the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium. The branches of this vessel are distributed partly to the dura mater, but chiefly to the bones; they anastomose with the arteries of the opposite side, and with the anterior and posterior meningeal. The middle meningeal on entering the cranium gives off the following colla- teral branches : i. Numerous small vessels to the ganglion of the fifth nerve, and to the dura mater in this situation. 2. A branch (jjetrosal branch), which enters the hiatus Fallopii, supplies the facial nerve, and anastomoses with the stylo- mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. 3. Orbital branches, which pass through the sphenoidal fissure, or through separate canals in the great wing of the sphenoid to anastomose with the lachrymal or other branches of the ophthalmic artery. 4. Temporal branches, which pass through foramina in the great wing of the sphenoid, and anastomose in the temporal fossa with the deep temporal arteries. Surgical Anatomy.—The middle meningeal is an artery of considerable surgical importance, as it may be injured in fractures of the temporal region of the skull, and the injury may be followed by considerable hsemorrhage between the bone and dura mater, which may cause compression of the brain, and require the operation of trephining for its relief. This artery crosses the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone at a point inch behind the external angular process of the frontal bone, and if inch above the zygoma. From this point the anterior branch passes upwards and slightly backwards to the sagittal suture, lyino^ about ^ inch to f inch behind the coronal suture. The posterior branch passes upwards and backwards over the squamous portion of the temporal bone. In order to expose the artery as it lies in the canal in the parietal bone, a semilunar incision, with its convexity upwards, should be made, commencing an inch behind the external angular process, and carried backwards for 2 inches. The structures cut through are : (i) skin ; (2) superficial fascia, with branches of the superficial temporal vessels and nerves ; (3) the fascia continued down from the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis; (4) the two layers of the temporal fascia ; (5) the temporal muscle ; (6) the deep temporal vessels; (7) the pericranium; and (8) the bone. The small meningeal is sometimes derived from the preceding. It enters the skull through the foramen ovale, and supplies the Gasserian ganglion and dura mater. Before entering the cranium it gives oft' a branch to the nasal fossa, soft palate, and tonsil. The inferior dental descends with the dental nerve to the foramen on the inner side of the ramus of the jaw. It runs along the dental canal in the substance of the bone, accompanied by the nerve, and opposite the first bicuspid tooth divides into two branches, incisor and mental; the former is continued forwards beneaihARTEEIES 542 the incisor teeth as far as the symphysis, where it anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side; the mental branch escapes with the nerve at the mental foramen, supplies the structures composing the chin, and anastomoses with the submental, inferior labial, and inferior coronary arteries. As the dental artery enters the foramen, it gives off a mylo-hyoid branch, which runs in the mylo-hyoid groove, and ramifies on the under surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The dental and incisor arteries during their course through the substance of the bone give off a few twigs which are lost in the cancellous tissue, and a series of branches which correspond in number to the roots of the teeth : these enter the minute apertures at the extremities of the fangs, and supply the pulp of the teeth. Branches of the Second or Pterygoid Portion Deep Temporal. Masseteric. Pterygoid. Buccal. These branches are distributed, as their names imply, to the muscles in the maxillary region. The deep temporal branches, two in number, anterior and posterior, each occupy that part of the temporal fossa indicated by its name. Ascending between the Temporal muscle and pericranium, they supply that muscle, and anastomose with the other temporal arteries; the anterior branch communicating with the lachrymal through small branches which perforate the malar bone and great wing of the sphenoid. The pterygoid branches, irregular in their number and origin, supply the Pterygoid muscles. The masseteric is a small branch which passes outwards, above the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, to the deep surface of the Masseter. It supplies that muscle, and anastomoses with the masseteric branches of the facial and with the transverse facial artery. The buccal is a small branch which runs obliquely forwards, between the Internal pterygoid and the ramus of the jaw, to the outer surface of the Buccinator, to which it is distributed, anastomosing with branches of the facial artery. Branches of the Third or Spheno-maxillary Portion Alveolar. Vidian. Infra-orbital. Pterygo-palatine. Posterior or Descending Palatine. Naso- or Spheno-palatine. The alveolar or posterior dental branch is given off from the internal maxillary by a common branch with the infra-orbital, and just as the trunk of the vessel is passing into the spheno-maxillary fossa. Descending upon the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone, it divides into numerous branches, some of which enter the posterior dental canals, to supply the molar and bicuspid teeth and the lining of the antrum, and others are continued forwards on the alveolar process to supply the gums. The infra-orbital appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the trunk of the internal maxillary. It arises from that vessel by a common trunk with the preceding branch, and runs along the infra-orbital canal with the superior maxil- lary nerve, emerging upon the face at the infra-orbital foramen, beneath the Levator labii superioris. Whilst contained in the canal, it gives off branches which ascend into the orbit, and supply the Inferior rectus and Inferior oblique musdes and the lachrymal gland. Other branches {anterior'- dental) descend through canals in the bone, to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum, and the front teeth of the upper jaw. On the face, some branches pass inwards towards the nose, anastomosing with the angular branch of the facial artery and nasal branch of the ophthalmic ; and other branches descend beneath the Levator labii superioris, and anastomose with the transverse facial and buccal branches.543 ANTEEIOR TRIANGLE OF THE NECK The four remaining branches arise from that portion of the internal maxillary which is contained in the spheno-maxillary fossa. The descending palatine passes down the posterior palatine canal with the anterior palatine branch of Meckel's ganglion, and, emerging from the posterior palatine foramen, runs forward in a groove on the inner side of the alveolar border of the hard palate to the anterior palatine canal, where the terminal branch of the artery passes upwards through the foramen of Stenson to anastomose with the naso- palatine artery. Its branches are distributed to the gums, the mucous membrane of the hard palate, and the palatine glands. Whilst it is contained in the palatine canal, it gives off branches, which descend in the accessory palatine canals to supply the soft palate and tonsil, anastomosing with the ascending palatine artery. The Vidian branch passes backwards along the Vidian canal with the Vidian nerve. It is distributed to the upper part of the pharynx and Eustachian tube, sending a small branch into the tympanum, which anastomoses with the anterior tympanic. The pterygo-palatine is also a very small branch, which passes backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pharyngeal nerve, and is distributed to the upper part of the pharynx and Eustachian tube. The spheno-palatine passes through the spheno-palatine foramen into the cavity of the nose, at the back part of the superior meatus, and divides into two branches : one internal, the naso-palatine or superior artery of the septum, passes obliquely downwards and forwards along the septum nasi, supplies the mucous membrane, and anastomoses in front with the terminal branch of the descending palatine. The external branches, two or three in number, supply the mucous membrane covering the lateral wall of the nose, the antrum, and the ethmoid and sphenoid cells. The Teiangles of the Neck The student having considered the relative anatomy of the large arteries of the neck and their branches, and the relations they bear to the veins and nerves, should now examine these structures collectively, as they present themselves in certain regions of the neck, in each of which important operations are constantly being performed. The side of the neck presents a somewhat quadrilateral outline, limited, above, by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and an imaginary line extending from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; below, by the prominent upper border of the clavicle; in front, by the median line of the neck; behind, by the anterior margin of the Trapezius muscle. This space is subdivided into two large triangles by the Sterno-mastoid muscle, which passes obliquely across the neck, from the sternum and clavicle below, to the mastoid process above. The triangular space in front of this muscle is called the anterior triangle; and that behind it, the posterior triangle. Anterior Triangle of the Neck The anterior triangle is bounded, in front, by a line extending from the chin to the sternum ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid ; its base, directed upwards, is formed by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and a line extending from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; its apex is below, at the sternum. This space is subdivided into three smaller triangles by the Digastric muscle above, and the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid below. These smaller triangles are named, from below upwards, the inferior carotid, the superior carotid, and the submaxillary triangle. The Inferior Carotid Triangle is bounded, in front, by the median line of the neck ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid ; above, by the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid; and is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia; ramifying between which is the descending branch of the superficialis colli nerve. Beneath these superficial structures are the Sterno-AKTERIES 544 hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, which, together with the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid, conceal the lower part of the common carotid artery.* This vessel is enclosed within its sheath, together with the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve ; the vein lying on the outer side of the artery on the right side of the neck, but overlapping it, or passing directly across it on the left side; the nerve lying between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. In front of the sheath are a few filaments descending from the loop of communication between the descendens and communicans Jaypogiossi; behind the sheath are seen the inferior thyroid artery, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the sympathetic nerve; and on its inner side, the trachea, the thyroid gland—much more prominent in the female than in the male—and the lower part of the larynx. By cutting into the upper part of this space, and slightly displacing the Sterno- mastoid muscle, the common carotid artery may be tied below the Omo-hyoid muscle. The floor of the inferior carotid triangle is formed by the Longus colli muscle below, and by the Scalenus anticus above (see fig. 284, page 401), between which muscles the vertebral artery and vein will be found passing into the foramen in the sixth transverse process ; a small portion of the origin of the Rectus capitis anticus major may also be seen in the floor of the space. The Superior Carotid Triangle is bounded, behind, by the Sterno-mastoid; below, by the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid; and above by the posterior belly of the Digastric muscle. It is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia; ramifying between which are branches of the facial and superficialis colli nerves. Its floor is formed by parts of the Thyro-hyoid, Hyo-glossus, and the inferior and middle Constrictor muscles of the pharynx. This space contains the upper part of the common carotid artery, which bifurcates opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into the external and internal carotid. These vessels are occasionally somewhat concealed from view by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, which overlaps them. The external and internal carotids lie side by side, the external being the more anterior of the two. The following branches of the external carotid are also met with in this space: the superior thyroid, running forwards and downwards; the lingual, directly forwards; the facial, forwards and upwards; the occipital, backwards; and the ascending pharyngeal directly upwards on the inner side of the internal carotid. The veins met with are : the internal jugular, which lies on the outer side of the common and internal carotid arteries ; and veins corresponding to the above-mentioned branches of the external carotid—viz. the superior thyroid, the lingual, facial, ascending pharyngeal, and sometimes the occipital—all of which accompany their corresponding arteries, and terminate in the internal jugular. The nerves in this space are the following : In front of the sheath of the common carotid is the descendens hypogiossi. The hypoglossal nerve crosses both carotids above, curving round the occipital artery at its origin. Within the sheath, between the artery and vein, and behind both, is the pneumogastric nerve ; behind the sheath, the sympathetic. On the outer side of the vessels, the spinal accessory nerve runs for a short distance before it pierces the Sterno-mastoid muscle; and on the inner side of the external carotid, just below the hyoid bone, may be seen the superior laryngeal nerve; and, still more inferiorly, the external laryngeal nerve. The upper part of the larynx and lower part of the pharynx are also found in the front part of this space. The Submaxillary Triangle corresponds to the part of the neck immediately beneath the body of the jaw. It is bounded, above, by the lower border of the body of the jaw, and a line drawn from its angle to the mastoid process; below, by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles ; in front, by the * Therefore the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein are not, strictly speaking, contained in this triangle, since they are covered by the Scerno-niastoid muscle ; that is to say, lie behind the anterior l^order of that muscle, which forms the posterior border of the triangle. But as they lie very close to the structures which are really con- tained in the triangle, and whose position it is essential to remember in operating on this part of the artery, it has seemed expedient to study the relations of all these parts together.545 POSTEEIOR TRIANGLE OF THE NECK middle line of the neck. It is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia; ramifying between which are branches of the facial and ascending filaments of the superficial cervical nerves. Its floor is formed by the anterior belly of the Digastric, the Mylo-hyoid, and Hyo-glossus muscles. This space contains, in front, the submaxillary gland, imbedded in the sub- stance of which are the facial artery and vein, and their glandular branches ; beneath this gland, on the surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, are the submental artery and the mylo-hyoid artery and nerve. The back part of this space is sepa- rated from the front part by the stylo-maxillary ligament; it contains the external carotid artery, ascending deeply in the substance of the parotid gland ; this vessel here lies in front of, and superficial to, the internal carotid, being crossed by the facial nerve, and gives off in its course the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary branches: more deeply are the internal carotid, the internal jugular vein, and the pneuniogastric nerve, separated from the external carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the giosso-pharyngeal nerve.* PosTEEioE Triangle of the Neck The posterior triangle is bounded, in front, by the Sterno-mastoid muscle; behind, by the anterior margin of the Trapezius ; its base corresponds to the upper border of the clavicle; its apex, to the occiput. The space is crossed, about an inch above the clavicle, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid, which divides it unequally into two, an upper or occipital, and a lower or subclavian, triangle. The Occipital, the larger of the two posterior triangles, is bounded, in front, by the Sterno-mastoid; behind, by the Trapezius; below, by the Omo-hyoid. Its floor is formed from above downwards by the Splenius, Levator anguli scapulae, and the middle and posterior Scaleni muscles. It'is covered by the integument, the Platysma below, the superficial and dee]D fasciae, and by the spinal accessory nerve which is directed obliquely across the space from the Sterno-mastoid, which it pierces, to the under surface of the Trapezius; below, the descending branches of the cervical plexus and the transversalis colli artery and vein cross the space. A chain of lymphatic glands is also found running along the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, from the mastoid process to the root of the neck. The Subclavian, the smaller of the two posterior triangles, is bounded, above, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid; below, by the clavicle ; its base, directed forwards, being formed by the Sterno-mastoid. The size of the subclavian triangle varies according to the extent of attachment of the clavicular portion of the Sterno-mastoid and Trapezius muscles, and also according to the height at which the Omo-hyoid crosses the neck above the clavicle. Its height also varies much, according to the position of the arm, being much diminished by raising the limb, on account of the ascent of the clavicle, and increased by drawing-the arm down- wards, when that bone is depressed. This space is covered by the integument, superficial and deep fasciae; and crossed by the descending branches of the cervical plexus. Just above the level of the clavicle, the third portion of the subclavian artery curves outwards and downwards from the outer margin of the Scalenus anticus, across the first rib, to the axilla. Sometimes this vessel rises as high as an inch and a half above the clavicle, or to any point intermediate between this and its usual level. Occasionally, it passes in front of the Scalenus anticus, or pierces the fibres of that muscle. The subclavian vein lies behind the clavicle, and is usually not seen in this space ; but it occasionally rises as high up as the artery, and has even been seen to pass with that vessel behind the Scalenus anticus. The brachial plexus of nerves lies above the artery, and in close contact * The same remark will apply to this triangle as was made about the inferior carotid triangle. The structures enumerated as contained in the back part of the space lie, strictly speaking, beneath the muscles which form the posterior boundary of the triangle; but as it is very important to bear in mind their close relation to the parotid gland and its boundaries (on account of the frequency of surgical operations on this gland), all these parts are spoken of together. N N546 ARTEEIES with it. Passing transversely across the clavicular margin of the space, are the suprascapular vessels ; and traversing its upper angle in the same direction, the transversalis colli artery and vein. The external jugular vein runs vertically downwards behind the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, to terminate in the subclavian vein ; it receives the transverse cervical and suprascapular veins, which occasionally form a plexus in front of the artery, and a small vein which crosses the clavicle from the cephalic. The small nerve to the Subclavius muscle also crosses this triangle about its middle. A lymphatic gland is also found in the space. Its floor is formed by the first rib with the first digitation of the Serratus magnus. Internal Carotid Artery The internal carotid artery supplies the anterior part of the brain, the eye, and its ajDpendages, and sends branches to the forehead and nose. Its size, in the adult, is equal to that of the external carotid, though, in the child, it is larger than that vessel. It is remarkable for the number of curvatures that it presents in different parts of its course. In its cervical portion it occasionally presents one or two flexures near the base of the skull, whilst through the rest of its extent it describes a double curvature w^hich resembles the italic letter s placed horizontally. These curvatures most probably diminish the velocity of the current of blood, by increasing the extent of surface over which it moves, and adding to the amount of impediment produced from friction. In considering the course and relations of this vessel, it may be conveniently divided into four portions : a cervical, petrous, cavernous, and cerebral. Cervical Portion.—This portion of the internal carotid commences at the bifurcation of the common carotid, opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and runs perpendicularly upwards, in front of the transverse processes of the three upper cervical vertebrae, to the carotid canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is superficial at its commencement, being contained in the superior carotid triangle, and lying on the same level as the external carotid, but behind that artery, overlapped by the Sterno-mastoid, and covered by the deep fascia, Platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles, and the external carotid and occipital arteries. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus muscles, the giosso-pharyngeal nerve, and pharyngeal branch of the pneumogastric. It is in relation, behind, with the Rectus capitis anticus major, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and superior laryngeal nerve ; externally, with the internal jugular vein and pneumo- gastric nerve ; internally, with the pharynx, tonsil, the superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. Petrous Portion.—When the internal carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves forwards and inwards, and again ascends as it leaves the canal to enter the cavity of the skull. In this canal, the artery lies at first anterior to the tympanum, from which it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often absorbed in old age. It is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by filaments of the carotid plexus. Cavernous Portion.—The internal carotid artery, in this part of its course, is situated between the layers of the dura mater forming the cavernous sinus, but covered by the lining membrane of the sinus. It at first ascends to the posterior clinoid process, then passes forwards by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, and again curves upwards on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process, and perforates the dura mater forming the roof of the sinus. In this part of its course it is surrounded by filaments of the sympathetic nerve, and has in relation with it externally the sixth nerve. Cerebral Portion.—Having perforated the dura mater, on the inner side of the■6- INTERNAL CAROTID 547 anterior clinoid process, the internal carotid enters the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius, where it gives off its terminal or cerebral branches. This portion of the artery has the optic nerve on its inner side, and the third nerve externally. Plan op the Relations of the Internal Carotid Artery in the Neck hi front.

Peculiarities.—The length of the internal carotid varies according to the length of the neck, and also according to the point of bifurcation of the common carotid. Its origin sometimes takes place from the arch of the aorta; in such rare instances, this vessel has been found to be placed nearer the middle line of the neck than the external carotid, as far upwards as the larynx, when the latter vessel crossed the internal carotid. The course of the vessel, instead of being straight, may be very tortuous. A few instances are recorded in which this vessel was altogether absent : in one of these the common carotid passed up the neck, and gave off the usual branches of the external carotid : the cranial portion of the internal carotid being replaced by two branches of the internal maxillary, which entered the skull through the foramen rotundum and ovale, and joined to form a single vessel. Surgical Anatomy.—The cervical part of the internal carotid is very rarely wounded. Mr. Cripps, in an interesting paper in the ' Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,' compares the rareness of a wound of the internal carotid with one of the external or its branches. It is, however, sometimes injured b.y a stab or gunshot wound in the neck, or even occasionally by a stab from within the mouth, as when a person receives a thrust from the end of a parasol, or falls down with a tobacco-pipe in his mouth. The relation of the internal carotid with the tonsil should be especially remembered, as instances have occurred in which the artery has been wounded during the operation of scarifying the tonsil, and fatal haemorrhage has supervened. The indications for ligature are wounds, when the vessel should be exposed by a careful dissection and tied above and below the bleeding-point; and aneurism, which if non-traumatic may be treated by ligature of the common carotid ; but if traumatic in origin, by exposing the sac and tying the vessel above and below. The incision for ligature of the cervical portion of the internal carotid should be made along .the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, from the angle of the jaw to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. The superficial structures being divided, and the Sterno-mastoid defined and drawn outwards, the cellular tissue must be carefully separated and the posterior belly of the Digastric and hypoglossal nerve sought for as guides to the vessel. When the artery is found, the external carotid should be drawn inwards and the Digastric muscles upwards, and the aneurism needle passed from without inwards. The branches given oft* from the internal carotid are :— Tympanic (internal or deep). |Arteria3 Receptaculi. ■i Anterior Meningeal.

The tympanic is a small branch which enters the cavity of the tympanum through a nnnute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the mternal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. The arteriae receptaculi are numerous small vessels, derived from the internal Fig. 352.—The internal carotid and vertebral arteries.

It then passes over the nerve, to the inner wall of the orbit, and thence horizontally forwards, beneath the lower border of the Superior oblique muscle to a point behind the internal angular process of the frontal bone, where it divides into two terminal branches, the frontal and nasal. Branches.—The branches of this vessel may be divided into an orbital groiijp, Fig. 353.—The ophthahnic artery and its branches, the roof of the orbit having been removed.

Arteria Centralis Retinae. The lachrymal is the first, and one of the largest branches derived from the ophthalmic, arising close to the optic foramen : not unfrequently it is given oft* from the artery before it enters the orbit. It accompanies the lachrynlal nerve along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, and is distributed to the lachrymal gland. Its terminal branches, escaping from the gland, are distributed to the eyelids and conjunctiva, anastomosing with the palpebral arteries. The lachrymal artery gives off one or two malar branches ; one of which passes through a foramen in the malar bone, to reach the temporal fossa, and anastomoses withARTERIES 55° the deep temporal arteries ; the other appears on the cheek, and anastomoses with the transverse faciah A branch is also sent backwards, through the sphenoidal fissure, to the dura mater, which anastomoses with a branch of the middle menin- geal artery. Peculiarities.—The lachrymal artery is sometimes derived from one of the anterior branches of the middle meningeal artery. The supra-orbital artery arises from the ophthalmic as that vessel is crossing over the optic nerve. Ascending so as to rise above all the muscles of the orbit, it passes forwards, with the supra-orbital nerve, between the periosteum and Levator palpebra; and, passing through the supra-orbital foramen, divides into a superficial and deep branch, which supply the integument, the muscles, and the pericranium of the forehead, anastomosing with the frontal, the anterior branch of the temporal, and the artery of the opposite side. This artery in the orbit supplies the Superior rectus and the Levator palpebrse, and sends a branch inwards, across the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle, to supply the parts at the inner canthus. At the supra-orbital foramen it frequently transmits a branch to the diploe. The ethmoidal branches are two in number : posterior and anterior. The former, which is the smaller, passes through the posterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the posterior ethmoidal cells, and, entering the cranium, gives off a meningeal branch", which supplies the adjacent dura mater ; and nasal branches which descend into the nose through apertures in the cribriform plate, anasto- mosing with branches of the spheno-palatine. The anterior ethmoidal artery accompanies the nasal nerve through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the anterior ethmoidal cells and frontal sinuses, and, entering the cranium, gives off a meningeal branch, which supplies the adjacent dura mater, and nasal branches, which descend into the nose, through apertures in the cribriform plate. The palpebral arteries, two in number, superior and inferior, arise from the ophthalmic, opposite the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle ; they leave the orbit to encircle the eyelids near their free margin, forming a superior and an inferior arch, which lie between the Orbicularis muscle and tarsal plates ; the superior palpebral inosculating at the outer angle of the orbit with the orbital branch of the temporal artery, and with a branch from the lachrymal artery : the inferior palpebral'inosculating, at the outer angle of the orbit, with a branch from the lachrymal and transverse facial arteries, and, at the inner side of the lid, with a branch from the angular artery. From this anastomosis a branch passes to the nasal duct, ramifying in its mucous membrane, as far as the inferior meatus. The frontal artery, one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, passes from the orbit at its inner angle, and, ascending on the forehead, supplies the integument, muscles, and pericranium, anastomosing with the supra-orbital artery, and with the artery of the opposite side. The nasal artery, the other terminal branch of the ophthalmic, emerges from the orbit above the tendo oculi, and, after giving a branch to the upper part of the lachrymal sac, divides into tivo branches, one of which anastomoses with the angular artery; the other, the dorsalis nasi, runs along the dorsum of the nose, supplies its entire surface, and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. The ciliary arteries are divisible into three groups, the short, long, and anterior. The short ciliary arteries, from six to twelve in number, arise from the ophthalmic, or some of its branches ; they surround the optic nerve as they pass forwards to the posterior part of the eyeball, pierce the sclerotic coat around the entrance of the nerve, and supply the choroid coat and ciliary processes. The long ciliary arteries, two in number, also pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and run forwards, along each side of the eyeball, between the sclerotic and choroid, to the ciliary muscle, where they divide into two branches ; these form an arterial circleOPHTHALMIC 551 around the circumference of the iris, from which numerous radiating branches pass forwards, in its substance, to its free margin, where they form a second arterial circle around its pupillary margin. The anterior cilimij arteries are derived from Fig. 354.—The arteries of the base of the brain. The right half of the cerebellum and pons have been removed. N.B.—It will be noticed that in the illustration the two anterior cerebral arteries have been drawn at a considerable distance. from each other; this makes the anterior communicating artery appear very much longer than it really is. the muscular branches ; they pierce the sclerotic a short distance from the cornea and terminate in the great arterial circle of the iris.ARTERIES 552 The arteria centralis retinae is one of the smallest branches of the ophthalmic artery. It arises from the ophthalmic as that vessel is about to cross over the optic nerve; it pierces the optic nerve obliquely, and runs forward in the centre of its substance, and enters the globe of the eye through the porus opticus. Its mode of distribution will be described in the account of the anatomy of the eye. The muscular branches, two in number, superior and inferior, supply the muscles of the eyeball. The superior, the smaller, often wanting, supplies the Levator palpebrje, Superior rectus, and Superior oblique. The inferior, more constant in its existence, passes forwards, between the optic nerve and Inferior rectus, and is distributed to the External, Internal, and Inferior recti, and Inferior oblique. This vessel gives off most of the anterior ciliary arteries. The cerebral branches of the internal carotid are : the anterior cerebral, the middle cerebral, the posterior communicating, and the anterior choroid. The anterior cerebral arises from the internal carotid, at the inner extremity of Fig. 355.—Vascular arese of the internal surface of the cerebrum. (After Charcot.)

It passes forwards in the great longitudinal fissure between the two anterior lobes of the brain, being connected, soon after its origin, with the vessel of the opposite side by a short anastomosing trunk, about two lines in length, the anterior communicating. The two anterior cerebral arteries, lying side by side, curve round the anterior border of the corpus callosum, and run along its upper surface to its posterior part, where they terminate by anastomosing with the posterior cerebral arteries. In their course they give off the following branches :— Antero-median Ganglionic. Middle and Internal Frontal. Anterior and Internal Frontal. Posterior and Internal Frontal. The antero-median ganglionic is a group of small arteries which arise at the commencement of the anterior cerebral artery ; they pierce the anterior perforated space and lamina cinerea, and supply the head of the caudate nucleus. The anterior and internal frontal branches supply the two inferior frontal convolutions. The middle and internal frontal branches supply the corpus553 BRANCHES OF INTERNAL CAROTID callosum, the convolution of the corpus callosum, the inner surface of the first frontal convolution, and the upper part of the ascending frontal convolution. The posterior and internal frontal branches supply the lobus quadratus. The anterior communicating artery is a short branch, about two lines in length, but of moderate size, connecting together the two anterior cerebral arteries across the longitudinal fissure. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single trunk, which afterwards divides. Or the vessel may be wholly, or partially, divided into two ; frequently, it is longer and smaller than usual. It gives off some of the antero-median ganglionic group of vessels, which are, however, principally derived from the anterior cerebral. The middle cerebral artery (fig. 356), the largest branch of the internal carotid, passes obliquely outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and, opposite the island of Reil, divides into its terminal branches. The branches of the middle cerebral artery are :— Antero-lateral Ganglionic. Ascending Frontal. External and Inferior Frontal. Ascending Parietal. Parieto-sphenoidal. Fig. 356.—The distribution of the middle cerebral artery. (After Charcot.) The antero-lateral ganglionic branches are a group of small arteries which arise at the commencement of the middle cerebral artery; they pierce the anterior perforated space and supply the greater part of the caudate nucleus, the lenticular nucleus, the internal capsule, and a part of the optic thalamus. One artery of this group, distributed to the lenticular nucleus, is of larger size than the rest, and is of special importance, as being the artery in the brain most frequently ruptured; it has been termed by Charcot, the ' artery of cerebral h(^morrhage.' The external and inferior frontal supplies the third or inferior frontal convolution (Broca's convolution). The ascending frontal supplies the ascending frontal convolution. The ascending 'parietal supplies the ascending parietal convolution. The parieto-sphenoidal supplies the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution and the angular gyrus. The posterior communicating artery arises from the back part of the internal carotid, runs directly backwards, and anastomoses with the posterior cerebral, a branch of the basilar. This artery varies considerably in size, being sometimes small, and occasionally so large that the posterior cerebral may be considered as554 ARTEKIES arising from the internal carotid rather than from the hasilar. It is frequently larger on one side than on the other side. From the posterior half of this vessel are given off a number of small branches, iliQ loostcro-median ganglionic branches, which, with similar vessels from the posterior cerebral, pierce the posterior perforated space and supply the internal surfaces of the optic thalami and the walls of the third ventricle. The anterior choroid is a small but constant branch, which arises from the back part of the internal carotid, near the posterior communicating artery. Passing backwards and outwards, it enters the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, beneath the edge of the middle lobe of the brain. It is distributed to the hippocampus major, corpus fimbriatum, velum interpositum, and choroid plexus. Fig. 357.—Diagram of the arterial circulation at the base of the brain. (After Charcot.) I.

THE BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE BRAIN Recent investigations have tended to show that the mode of distribution of the vessels of the brain has an important bearing upon a considerable number of the anatomical lesions of which this part of the nervous system may be the seat ; it therefore becomes important to consider a little more in detail the way in which the cerebral vessels are distributed. The cerebral arteries are derived from the internal carotid and the vertebral, which at the base of the brain form a remarkable anastomosis known as the circle of^ Willis, It is formed in front by the anterior cerebral arteries, branches of the internal carotid, which are connected together by the anterior communicating ; behind by the two posterior cerebrals, branches of the basilar which are connected on each side with the internal carotid by the posterior communicating (fig. 354,555 OF THE BRAIN p. 551). The parts of the brain included within this arterial circle are the lamina cinerea, the commissure of the optic nerves, the infundibulum, the tuber cinereum, the corpora albicantia, and the posterior perforated space. From the circle of Willis arise the three trunks which together supply each cerebral hemisphere. From its anterior part proceed the two anterior cerebrals ; from its antero-lateral part the middle cerebral, and from its posterior part the posterior cerebrals. Each of these principal arteries gives origin to two very different systems of secondary vessels. One of these systems has been named the central ganglionic system, and the vessels belonging to it supply the central ganglia of the brain ; the other has been named the cortical arterial system, and its vessels ramify in the pia mater and supply the cortex and subjacent medullary matter. These two systems, though they have a common origin, do not communicate at any Fig. 358.—Distribution of the cortical arteries. (After Charcot.) I. Medullary arteries, i'.

Though some of the arteries of the cortical system approach, at their terminations, the regions supplied by. the central ganglionic system, no communication between the two sets of vessels takes place, and there is between the parts supplied by the two systems a borderland of diminished nutritive activity, where, it is said, softening is especially liable to occur in the brains of old people. The central ganglionic system.—All the vessels belonging to this system are given off from the circle of Willis, or from the vessels immediately after their origin from it. So that if a circle is drawn at a distance of about an inch from the circle of Willis, it will include the origin of all the arteries belonging to this system (fig. 357). The vessels of this system form six principal groups : (i) The antero-median group, derived from the anterior cerebrals and anterior communicating; (ii) the postero-median group, from the posterior cerebrals and posterior communicating ; (ill) the right and left antero-lateral group from the middle cerebrals ; and (iv) the right and left yostero-lateral group from the posterior cerebrals, after they haveAETERIES wound round the crura cerebri. The vessels belongmg to this system are larger than those of the cortical system, and are what Cohnheim has termed ' terminal' arteries—that is to say, vessels which from their origin to their termination neither supply nor receive any anastomotic branch, so that, by one of the small vessels, onlv a limited area of the central ganglia can be injected, and the injection cannot be driven beyond the area of the part supplied by the particular vessel which is the subject of the experiment. The cortical arterial system.—The vessels forming this system are the terminal branches of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, described above. These vessels divide and ramify in the substance of the pia mater, and give off nutrient arteries which penetrate the cortex perpendicularly. These nutrient vessels are divisible into two classes, the long and short. The long, or, as they are sometimes called, the medullary arteries pass through the grey matter to penetrate the centrum ovale to the depth of about an inch and a half, without intercommunicating other- wise than by very fine capillaries, and thus constitute so many independent small systems. The short vessels are confined to the cortex, where they form with the long vessels a compact network in the middle zone of the grey matter, the outer and inner zones being sparingly supplied with blood (fig. 358). The vessels of the cortical arterial system are not so strictly ' terminal' as those of the central ganghonic system, but they approach this t3-pe very closely, so that injection of one area from the vessel of another area, though it may be possible, is frequently very difficult, and is only effected through vessels of small calibre. As a result of this, obstruction of one of the main branches, or its divisions, may have the effect of producing softening in a very limited area of the cortex.* ARTERIES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY The artery which supplies the upper extremity continues as a single trunk from its commencement down to the elbow; but different portions of it have received different names, according to the region through which it passes. That part of the vessel which extends from its origin to the lower border of the first rib, is termed the subclavian; beyond this point to the lower border of the axilla, it is termed the axillary; and from the lower margin of the axillary space to the bend of the elbow, it is termed brachial; here, the single trunk terminates by dividing into two branches, the radial and ulnar, an arrangement precisely similar to what occurs in the lower limb. Subclavian Aeteeies (fig. 359) The subclavian artery on the right side arises from the innominate artery opposite the right sterno-clavicular articulation ; on the left side it arises from the arch of the aorta. It follows, therefore, that these two vessels must, in the first part of their course, differ in their length, their direction, and their relation with neighbouring parts. In order to facilitate the description of these vessels, more especially from a surgical point of view, each subclavian artery has been divided into three parts. The first portion, on the right side, passes upwards and outwards from the origin of the vessel to the inner border of the Scalenus anticus. On the left side it ascends nearly vertically, to gain the inner border of that muscle. The second part passes outwards, behind the Scalenus anticus ; and the third part passes from the outer margin of that muscle, beneath the clavicle, to the lower border of the first rib, * The student who desires further information on this subject is referred to Charcot's Localisation of Cerebral and Spinal Diseases, p. 42 et seq., whence the facts above given have been principally derived.557 SUBCLAVIAN where it becomes the axillary artery. The first portion of these two vessels differs so much in its course, and in its relation with neighbouring x^arts, that it will be described separately. The second and third parts are alike on the two sides. FiKST Part of the Right Subclavian Artery (figs. 344, 359) The right subclavian artery arises from the arteria innominata, opposite the right sterno-clavicular articulation, and passes upwards and outwards to the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus muscle. In this part of its course it ascends a Fig. 359.—The subclavian artery, showing its relations. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons.) little above the clavicle, the extent to which it does so varying in different cases. It is covered, in front, by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the Sterno-mastoid, the Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles, and another layer of the deep fascia. It is crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, and by the pneumogastric, the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and the phrenic nerve. Beneath, the artery is invested by the pleura ; and behind, it is separated by a cellular interval from the Longus colli,558 ARTERIES the neck of the first rib, and the cord of the sympathetic nerve; the recurrent laryngeal nerve winds round the lower and back part of the vessel.

First Part of the Left Subclavian Artery (fig. 344) The left subclavian artery arises from the end of the arch of the aorta, opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra, and ascends nearly vertically to the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus muscle. This part of the vessel is, therefore, longer than the right, situated more deeply in the cavity of the chest, and directed nearly vertically upwards instead of arching outwards like the vessel of the opposite side. It is in relation, in front, ^Yith the pleura, the left lung, the pneumogastric, cardiac, and phrenic nerves, which lie parallel with it, the left carotid artery, left internal jugular and vertebral veins, and the commencement of the left innominate vein, and is covered by the Sterno-thyroid, Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles ; it has the left carotid in front of, but not in contact with it; behind, it is in relation with the oesophagus, thoracic duct, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, Longus colli, and vertebral column.

Relations.—It is covered, in front, by the skin, superficial fascia, Platysma, deep cervical fascia, Sterno-mastoid, and by the phrenic nerve, which is separated from the artery by the Scalenus anticus muscle.

The external jugular vein crosses it at its inner side, and receives the suprascapular and transverse cervical veins, which occasionally form a plexus in front of it. The subclavian vein is below the artery, lying close behind the clavicle. Behind, it lies on the Middle Scalenus muscle. Above it, and to its outer side, is the brachial plexus, and Omo-hyoid muscle. Beloiv, it rests on the upper surface of the first rib. Peculiarities.—The subclavian arteries vary in theh origin, their course, and the height to which they rise in the neck. TJie origin of the right subclavian from the innominate takes place, in some cases, above the sterno-clavicular articulation; and occasionally, but less frequently, in the cavity of the thorax, below that joint. Or the artery may arise as a separate trunk from the arch of the aorta. In such cases it may be either the first, second, third, or even the last branch derived from that vessel; in the majority of cases, it is the first or last, rarely the second or third. When it is the first branch, it occupies the ordinary position of the innominate artery ; when the second or third, it gains its usual position by passing behind the right carotid ; and when the last branch, it arises from the left extremity of the arch, at its upper or back part, and passes obliquely towards the right side, usually behind the oesophagus and right carotid, sometimes between the oesophagus and trachea, to the upper border of the first rib, whence it follows its ordinary course. In very rare instances, this vessel arises from the thoracic aorta, as low down as the fourth dorsal vertebra. Occa- sionally, it perforates the anterior Scalenus; more rarely it passes in front of that muscle. Sometimes the subclavian vein passes with the artery behind the Scalenus. The artery sometimes ascends as high as an inch and a half above the clavicle, or any interme- diate point between this and the upper border of the bone, the right subclavian usually ascending higher than the left. The left subclavian is occasionally joined at its origin with the left carotid. Surface Marhing.— The course of the subclavian artery in the neck may be mapped out, by describing a curve, with its convexity upwards at the base of the posterior triangle. The inner end of this curve corresponds to the sterno-clavicular joint, the outer end to the centre of the lower border of the clavicle. The cmwe is to be drawn with such an amount of convexity that its mid-point reaches half an inch above the upper border of the clavicle. The left subclavian artery is more deeply placed than the right in the first part of its course, and, as a rule, does not reach quite as high a level in the neck. It should be borne in mind that the posterior border of the Sterno mastoid muscle corresponds to the outer border of the Scalenus anticus, so that the third portion of the artery, that part most accessible for operation, lies immediately external to the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid. Surgical Anatomy.—The relations of the subclavian arteries of the two sides having been examined, the student should direct his attention to a consideration of the best posi- tion in which compression of the vessel may be effected, or in what situation a ligature may be best applied in cases of aneurism or wound. Comjjressiofi of the subclavian artery is required in cases of operations about the shoulder, in the axilla, or at the upper part of the arm; and the student will observe that there is only one situation in which it can be effectually applied, viz. where the artery passes across the outer surface of the first rib. In order to compress the vessel in this situation, the shoulder should be depressed, and the surgeon grasping the side of the neck should press with his thumb in the angle formed by the posterior border of the Sterno- mastoid with the upper border of the clavicle, downwards, backwards, and inwards against the rib; if from any cause the shoulder cannot be sufficiently depressed, pressure may be made from before backwards, so as to compress the artery against the Middle scalenus and transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. In appropriate cases, a preliminary incision may be made through the cervical fascia, and the finger may be pressed down directly upon the artery. Ligature of the subclavian artery may be required in cases of wounds, or of aneurism in the axilla, or in cases of aneurism on the cardiac side of the point of ligature ; and the third part of the artery is that which is most favourable for an operation, on account of its being comparatively superficial, and most remote from the origin of the large branches. In those cases where the clavicle is not displaced, this operation may be performed with comparative facility; but where the clavicle is pushed up by a large aneraismal tumour in the axilla, the artery is placed at a great depth from the surface, which materially increases the difficulty of the operation. Under these circumstances, it becomes a matter of importance to consider the height to Avhich this vessel reaches above the bone. In ordinary cases, its arch is about half an inch above the clavicle, occasionally as high as an inch and a half, and sometimes so low as to be on a level with its upper border. If the clavicle is displaced, these variations will necessarily make the operation more or less diflicult, according as the vessel is more or less accessible. The chief points in the operation of tying the third portion of the subclavian artery are as follows : the patient being placed on a table in the horizontal position, with the head drawn over to the opposite side, and the shoulder depressed as much as possible, theSUBCLAVIAN 561 integument should be drawn downwards upon the clavicle, and an incision made through it, upon that bone, from the anterior border of the Trapezius to the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, to which may be added a short vertical incision meeting the preceding in its centre. The object in drawing the skin downwards is to avoid any risk of wounding the external jugular vein, for as it perforates the deep fascia above the clavicle, it cannot be drawn downwards with the skin. The cervical fascia should be divided upon a director, and if the interval between the Trapezius and Sterno-mastoid muscles be insufticient for the performance of the operation, a portion of one or both may be divided. The external jugular vein will now be seen towards the inner side of the wound : this and the supra- scapular and transverse cervical veins which terminate in it should be held aside. If the external jugular vein is at all in the way and exposed to injury, it should be tied in two places and divided- The suprascapular artery should be avoided, and the Omo-hyoid muscle held aside if necessary. In the space beneath this muscle, careful search must be made for the vessel; a deep layer of fascia and some connective tissue having been divided carefully, the outer margin of the Scalenus anticus muscle must be felt for, and the finger being guided by it to the first rib, the pulsation of the subclavian artery will be felt as it passes over the rib. The aneurism needle may then be passed around the vessel from above downwards and inwards so as to avoid including any of the branches of the brachial plexus. If the clavicle is so raised by the tumour that the application of the ligature cannot be effected in this situation, the artery may be tied above the first rib, or even behind the Scalenus anticus muscle ; the difficulties of the operation in such a case will be materially increased, on account of the greater depth of the artery, and the alteration in position of the surrounding parts. The second part of the subclavian artery, from being that portion which rises highest in the neck, has been considered favourable for the application of the ligature, when it is difficult to tie the artery in the third part of its cou.rse. There are, however, many objections to the operation in this situation. It is necessary to divide the Scalenus anticus muscle, upon which lies the phrenic nerve, and at the inner side of which is situated the internal jugular vein ; and a wound of either of these structures might lead to the most dangerous consequences. Again, the artery is in contact, below, with the pleura, which must also be avoided ; and, lastly, the proximity of so many of its large branches arising internal to this point must be a still further objection to the operation. In cases, however, where the sac of an axillary aneurism encroaches on the neck, it may be necessary to divide the outer half or two-thirds of the Scalenus anticus muscle, so as to place the ligature on the vessel at a greater distance from the sac. The operation is performed exactly in the same way as ligature of the third portion, until the Scalenus anticus is exposed, when it is to be divided on a director (never to a greater extent than its outer two-thirds), and it immediately retracts. The operation is therefore merely an extension of ligature of th6 third portion of the vessel. In those cases of aneurism of the axillary or subclavian artery which encroach upon the outer portion of the Scalenus muscle to such an extent that a ligature cannot be applied in that situation, it may be deemed advisable, as a last resource, to tie the first portion of the subclavian artery. On the left side, this operation is almost impracticable; the great depth of the artery from the surface, its intimate relation with the pleura, and its close proximity to the thoracic duct and to so many important veins and nerves, present a series of difficulties which it is next to impossible to overcome.* On the right side, the operation is practicable, and has been performed, though never with success. The main objection to the operation in this situation is the smallness of the interval which usually exists between the commencement of the vessel and the origin of the nearest branch. The operation may be performed in the following manner:—The patient being placed on the table in the horizontal position, with the neck extended, an incision should be made along the upper border of the inner part of the clavicle, and a second along the inner border of the Sterno-mastoid, meeting the former at an angle. The sternal attachment of the Sterno- mastoid may now be divided on a director, and turned outwards; a few small arteries and veins, and occasionally the anterior jugular, must be avoided, or, if necessary, ligatured in two places and divided, and the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles divided in the same manner as the preceding muscle. After tearing through the deep fascia with the finger-nail, the internal jugular vein will be seen crossing the subclavian artery; this should be pressed aside, and the artery secured bypassing the needle from below upwards, by which the pleura is more effectually avoided. The exact position of the vagus nerve, the recurrent laryngeal, the phrenic and sympathetic nerves should be remembered, and the ligature should be applied near the origin of the vertebral, in order to afford as much room as possible for the formation of a coagulum between the ligature and the origin of the vessel. It should be remembered, that the right subclavian artery is occasionally deeply placed in the first part of its course, when it arises from the left side of the aortic arch, and passes in such cases behind the oesophagus, or between it and the trachea. Collateral Circulation.—After ligature of the third part of the subclavian artery, the * The operation was, however, performed in New York by Dr. J. K.

A middle or axillary set, which consisted of a number of small vessels derived from branches of the subclavian, above ; and, passing through the axilla, terminated either in the main trunk, or some of the branches of the axillary below. This last set presented most conspicuously the peculiar character of newly-formed or, rather, dilated arteries, being excessively tortuous, and forming a complete plexus. ' The chief agent in the restoration of the axillary artery below the tumour was the subscapular artery, which communicated most freely with the internal mammary, supra- scajjular, and posterior scapular branches of the subclavian, from all of which it received so great an influx of blood as to dilate it to three times its natural size.' * When a ligature is applied to the first part of the subclavian artery, the collateral circulation is carried on by : i, the anastomosis between the superior and inferior thyroid; 2, the anastomosis of the two vertebrals ; 3, the anastomosis of the internal mammary with the dee«p epigastric and the aortic intercostals ; 4, the superior intercostal anasto- mosing with the aortic intercostals; 5, the profunda cervicis anastomosing with the princeps cervicis ; 6, the scapular branches of the thyroid axis anastomosing with the iDranches of the axillary ; and 7, the thoracic branches of the axillary anastomosing with the aortic intercostals. Beanches of the Subclavian Artery These are four in number. On the left side all four branches, the vertebral, the internal mammary, the thyroid axis, and the superior intercostal, generally arise from the first portion of the vessel; but on the right side, the superior intercostal usually arises from the second portion of the vessel. On both sides of the body, the first three branches arise close together at the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus; in the majority of cases, a free interval of half an inch to an inch exist- ing between the commencement of the Fig. 360.—Plan of the branches of the artery and the origin of the nearest right subclavian artery. branch ; in a smaller number of cases, an interval of more than an inch exists, never exceeding an inch and three- quarters. In a very few instances, the interval had been found to be less than half an inch. The Vertebral Artery (fig. 352) is gene- \rally the first and largest branch of the subclavian ; it arises from the upper and back part of the first portion of the vessel, and, passing upwards, enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra,f and ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the vertebriie above this. Above the upper border of the axis, it inclines out- wards and upwards to the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, through which it passes ; it then winds backwards behind its articular process, runs in a deep groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of this bone, and, passing beneath the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, pierces the dura mater, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum. It then passes forwards and upwards to the front of the medulla oblongata, and unites with the vessel of the opposite side at the lower border of the pons Varolii to form the basilar artery. * Guy's Hosjntal Beports, vol. i. 1836.

Within the foramina formed by the transverse processes of the vertebrae, it is accompanied by a plexus of nerves from the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and is surrounded by a dense plexus of veins which unite to form the vertebral vein at the lower part of the neck. It is situated in front of the cervical nerves, as they issue from the intervertebral foramina. Whilst winding round the articular process of the atlas, it is contained in a triangular space {suboccipital triangle) toTmedi by the Rectus capitis posticus major, the Superior and the Inferior oblique muscles ; and at this point is covered by the Complexus muscle. Within the skull, as it winds round the medulla oblongata, it is placed between the hypo- glossal nerve and the anterior root of the suboccipital nerve, beneath the first digitation of the ligamentum denticulatum, and finally lies between the dura mater covering the basilar process of the occipital bone and the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata. Branches.—These may be divided into two sets—those given off in the neck, and those within the cranium. The lateral spinal branches enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina, and divide into two branches. Of these, one passes along the roots of the nerves to supply the spinal cord and its membranes, anastomosing with the other arteries of the spinal cord ; the other divides into an ascending and a descend- ing branch, which unite with similar branches from the artery above and below, so that two lateral anastomotic chains are formed on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, near the attachment of the pedicles. From these anastomotic chains branches are given off, to supply the periosteum and the bodies of the vertebrae, and to communicate with similar branches from the opposite side ; from these latter small branches are given off which join similar branches above and below, so that a central anastomotic chain is formed on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae. Muscular branches are given off to the deep muscles of the neck, where the vertebral artery curves round the articular process of the atlas. They anastomose with the occipital, and with the ascending and deep cervical arteries. The posterior meningeal are one or two small branches given off from the vertebral opposite the foramen magnum. They ramify between the bone and dura mater in the cerebellar fossae, and supply the falx cerebelli. The anterior spinal is a small branch, though larger than the posterior spinal, which arises near the termination of the vertebral, and, descending in front of the medulla oblongata, unites with its fellow of the opposite side at about the level of the foramen magnum. The single trunk, thus formed, descends on the front of the spinal cord, and is reinforced by a succession of small branches which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina ; these branches are derived from the vertebral and ascending cervical of the inferior thyroid in the neck ; from the intercostal in the dorsal region; and from the lumbar, ilio- lumbar, and lateral sacral arteries in the lower part of the spine. They unite, by means of ascending and descending branches, to form a single anterior median artery, which extends as far as the lower part of the spinal cord. This vessel is placed in the pia mater along the anterior median fissure; it supplies that mem- brane, and the substance of the cord, and sends off branches at its lower part to be distributed to the cauda equina, and ends on the central fibrous prolongation of the cord. Cervical Branches. Lateral Spinal. Muscular. Cranial Branches. 'Posterior Meningeal. Anterior Spinal. Posterior Spinal. Posterior Inferior Cerebellar. 002ARTEEIES 5^4 The posterior spinal arises from the vertebral, at the side of the medulla oblongata ; passing backwards to the posterior aspect of the spinal cord, it descends on each side, lying behind the posterior roots of the spinal nerves; and is reinforced by a succession of small branches, which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina, and by which it is continued to the lower part of the cord, and to the cauda equina. Branches from these vessels form a free anasto- mosis round the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, and communicate, by means of very tortuous transverse branches, with the vessel of the opposite side. At its commencement it gives off an ascending branch, which terminates on the side of the fourth ventricle. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (fig. 354), the largest branch of the vertebral, winds backwards round the upper part of the medulla oblongata, passing between the origin of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves, over the restiform body to the under surface of the cerebellum, where it divides into two branches : an internal one, which is continued backwards to the notch between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum ; and an external one, which supplies the under surface of the cerebellum, as far as its outer border, where it anastomoses with the anterior inferior cerebellar and the superior cerebellar branches of the basilar artery. Branches from this artery supply the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. * Surgical Anatomy.—The vertebral artery has been tied in several instances: i, for woimds or traumatic aneurism ; 2, after ligature of the innominate, either at the same time to prevent haemorrhage, or later on to arrest bleeding where it has occurred at the seat of ligature ; and 3, in epilepsy. In tbese latter cases the treatment has been recom- mended by Dr. Alexander, of Liverpool, in the hope that by diminishing the supply of blood to the posterior part of the brain and the spinal cord, a diminution or cessation of the epileptic fits would result. The operation of ligature of the vertebral is performed by making an incision along the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, just above the clavicle. The muscle is pulled to the inner side and the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra sought for. A deep layer of fascia being now divided, the interval between the Scalenus anticus and the Longus colli just below their insertion into the tubercle is defined, and the artery and vein found in the interspace. The vein is to be drawn to the outer side, and the aneurism needle passed from without inwards. I)rs. Eamskill and Bright have pointed out that severe pain at the back of the head may be symptomatic of disease of the vertebral artery just before it enters the skull. This is explained by the close connection of the artery with the suboccipital nerve in the groove on the posterior arch of the atlas. Disease of the same artery has been also said to affect speech, from pressure on the hypoglossal, where it is in relation with the vessel, leading to paralysis of the muscles of the tongue. The Basilar Artery, so named from its position at the base of the skull, is a single trunk formed by the junction of the two vertebral arteries ; it extends from the posterior to the anterior border of the pons Varolii, lying in its median groove, under cover of the arachnoid. It ends by dividing into two branches, the posterior cerebral arteries. Its branches are, on each side, the following :— Transverse. Superior Cerebral Anterior Inferior Cerebellar. Posterior Cerebral. The transverse branches supply the pons Varolii and adjacent parts of the brain; one branch, the internal auditory, accompanies the auditory nerve into the internal auditory meatus ; and another, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, passes across the crus cerebelli, to be distributed to the anterior border of the under surface of the cerebellum. The superior cerebellar arteries arise near the termination of the basilar. They wind round the crus cerebri, close to the fourth nerve, and arriving at the upper surface of the cerebellum, divide into branches which ramify in the pia mater and anastomose with the branches of the inferior cerebellar artery. Several branches are given to the pineal gland, and also to the velum interpositum. The posterior cerebral arteries, the two terminal branches of the basilar, are larger than the preceding, from which they are separated near their origin by the565 INFEEIOE THYROID third nerves. Winding round the crus cerebri, they pass to the under surface of the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, and divide into three main branches. Near their origin, they receive the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid. The branches of the posterior cerebral artery are :— Postero-median Ganglionic. Postero-lateral Ganglionic. Posterior Choroid. Three Terminal. The 2^oste7V-median ganglionic hranclies (fig. 357) are a group of small arteries which arise at the commencement of the posterior cerebral artery ; these, with similar branches from the posterior communicating, pierce the posterior perforated space, and supply the internal surfaces of the optic thalami and the walls of the third ventricle. The posterior choroid enters the interior of the brain beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum, and supplies the velum interpositum and the choroid plexus. The postero-lateral ganglionic branches are a group of small arteries which arise from the posterior cerebral artery, after it has turned round the crus cerebri; they supply a considerable portion of the optic thalamus. The terminal branches are distributed as follows : the first to the uncinate gyrus; the second to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe ; and the third to the cuneus or the occipital lobule. Circle of Willis.—The remarkable anastomosis which exists between the branches of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries at the base of the brain constitutes the circle of Willis. It is formed, in front, by the anterior cerebral arteries, branches of the internal carotid, which are connected together by the anterior communicating; behind, by the two posterior cerebrals, branches of the basilar, Avhich are connected on each side with the internal carotid by the posterior communicating arteries (fig. 354). It is by this anastomosis that the cerebral circulation is equalised, and provision made for effectually carrying it on if one or more of the branches are obliterated. The parts of the brain included within this arterial circle are : the lamina cinerea, the commissure of the optic nerves, the infundibulum, the tuber cinereum, the corpora albicantia, and the posterior perforated space. The Thyroid Axis (fig. 347) is a short thick trunk, which arises from the fore part of the first portion of the subclavian artery, close to the inner border of the Scalenus anticus muscle, and divides, almost immediately after its origin, into three branches, the inferior thyroid, suprascapular, and transversalis colli. The Inferior Thyroid Artery passes upwards, in a serpentine course, behind the sheath of the common carotid vessel and sympathetic nerve (the middle cervical ganglion resting upon it), and in front of the vertebral artery, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and Longus colli muscle, and is distributed to the under surface of the thyroid gland, anastomosing with the superior thyroid, and with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. Its branches are, the Inferior Laryngeal. CEsophageal. Tracheal. Ascending Cervical. Muscular. The inferior laryngeal branch ascends upon the trachea to the back part of the larynx, in company with the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and supplies the muscles and mucous membrane of this part, anastomosing with the branch from the opposite side, and with the laryngeal branch from the superior thyroid artery. The tracheal branches are distributed upon the trachea, anastomosing below with the bronchial arteries. The oesophageal branches are distributed to the oesophagus, and anastomose with the oesophageal branches of the aorta. The ascending cervical is a small branch which arises from the inferior thyroid, just where that vessel is passing behind the common carotid artery, and runs up on the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae in the interval between the Scalenus anticus and Rectus capitis anticus major. It gives branches to the muscles of the neck, which anastomose with branches of the566 AETERIES vertebral, and sends one or two branches into the spinal canal through the inter- vertebral foramina to be distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes, and to the bodies of the vertebrae in the same manner as the lateral spinal branches from the vertebral. It anastomoses with the ascending pharyngeal artery. The muscular branches supply the depressors of the hyoid bone, the Longus colli, the Scalenus anticus, and the Inferior constrictor of the pharynx. Surgical Anato?ny.—This artery is sometimes tied, in conjunction with the superior thyroid, in cases of bronchocele. An incision is made along the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid down to the clavicle. After the deep fascia has been divided, the Sterno- mastoid and carotid vessels are drawn outwards, and the carotid (Chassaignac's) tubercle sought for. The vessel will be found just below this tubercle, between the carotid sheath on the outer side and the trachea and oesophagus on the inner side. In passing the ligature, great care must be exercised to avoid including the recmTent laryngeal nerve. The Suprascapular Artery (transversalis humeri), smaller than the transversalis coin, passes obhquely from within outwards, across the root of the neck. It at first lies on the lower part of the Scalenus anticus, being covered by the Sterno- mastoid; it then crosses Fig. 361.—The scapular and circumflex arteries. subclavian artery, and runs outwards behind and Posterior scapular . . ,, ^ ^ ^ -, . ■, » Acromial branch parallel With the clavicle and Subclavius muscle, and beneath the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid, to the superior border of the scapula, where it passes over the transverse liga- ment of the scapula, to the supraspinous fossa. In this situation it lies close to the bone, and ramifies between it and the Supra- spinatus muscle, to which it is mainly distributed, giving off a communicating branch, which crosses the neck of the scapula, to reach the infraspinous fossa, where it anastomoses with the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. Besides distributing branches to the Sterno-mastoid and neighbouring muscles, it gives off a supra-acro7nial branch, which, piercing the Trapezius muscle, supplies the cutaneous surface of the acromion, anastomosing with the acromial thoracic artery. As the artery passes over the transverse ligament of the scapula, a branch descends into the subscapular fossa, ramifies beneath that muscle, and anastomoses with the posterior and subscapular arteries. It also supplies the shoulder-joint, and a nutrient branch to the clavicle. The Transversalis Colli passes transversely outwards, across the upper part of the subclavian triangle, to the anterior margin of the Trapezius muscle, beneath which it divides into two branches, the superficial cervical, and the posterior scapular. In its passage across the neck, it crosses in front of the Scaleni muscles and the brachial plexus, between the divisions of which it sometimes passes, and is covered by the Platysma, Sterno-mastoid, Omo-hyoid, and Trapezius muscles. The superficial cervical ascends beneath the anterior margin of the Trapezius, distributing branches to it, and to the neighbouring muscles and glands in the neck, and anastomoses with the superficial branch of the arteria princeps cervicis. The posterior scapular, the continuation of the transversalis colli, passes567 INTEENAL MAMMARY beneath the Levator anguli scapulaB to the superior angle of the scapula. It now descends along the posterior border of that bone as far as the inferior angle, where it anastomoses with the subscapular branch of the axillary. In its course it is covered by the Rhomboid muscles, supplying them and the Latissimus dorsi and Trapezius, and anastomosing with the suprascapular and subscapular arteries, and with the posterior branches of some of the intercostal arteries. Peculiarities.—The superficial cervical frequently arises as a separate branch from the thyroid axis ; and the posterior scapular, from the third, more rarely from the second, part of the subclavian. The Internal Mammary arises from the under surface of the first portion of the subclavian artery, opposite the thyroid axis. It descends behind the costal cartilage of the first rib to the inner surface of the anterior wall of the chest, resting against the costal cartilages about half an inch from the margin of the sternum; and, at the interval between the sixth and seventh cartilages, divides into two branches, the musculo-phre7iic, and superior eingastric. Relations.—At its origin it is covered by the internal jugular and subclavian veins, and crossed by the phrenic nerve. In the upper part of the thorax, it lies against the costal cartilages and Internal intercostal muscles in front, and is covered by the pleura behind. At the lower part of the thorax, the Triangularis sterni separates the artery from the pleura. The branches of the internal mammary are— Comes Nervi Phrenici (Superior Phrenic). Anterior Intercostal. Mediastinal. Perforating. Pericardiac. Musculo-phrenic. Sternal. Superior Epigastric. The comes nervi phrenici (superior phrenic), is a long slender branch, which accompanies the phrenic nerve, between the pleura and pericardium, to the Diaphragm, to which it is distributed; anastomosing with the other phrenic arteries from the internal mammary, and abdominal aorta. The mediastinal branches are small vessels, which are distributed to the areolar tissue and lymphatic glands in the anterior mediastinum, and the remains of the thymus gland. The pericardiac branches supply the upper part of the anterior surface of the pericardium, the lower part receiving branches from the musculo-phrenic artery. The sternal branches are distributed to the Triangularis sterni, and to the posterior surface of the sternum. The mediastinal, pericardiac, and sternal branches, together with some twigs from the comes nervi phrenici, anastomose with branches from the intercostal and bronchial arteries, and form a minute plexus beneath the pleura which has been named by Turner the suhpleural mediastinal jylexus. The anterior intercostal arteries supply the five or six upper intercostal spaces. The branch corresponding to each space soon divides into two; or the two branches may come off separately from the parent trunk. The small vessels pass outwards in the intercostal spaces, one lying near the lower margin of the rib above, and the other near the upper margin of the rib below, and anastomose with the intercostal arteries from the aorta. They are at first situated between the pleura and the Internal intercostal muscles, and then between the Internal and External intercostal muscles. They supply the Intercostal muscles, and by branches which perforate the External intercostal muscle, the Pectoral muscles and the mammary gland. The perforating arteries correspond to the five or six upper intercostal spaces. They arise from the internal mammary, pass forwards through the intercostal spaces, and, curving outAvards, supply the Pectoralis major, and the integument. Those which correspond to the second, third, and fourth spaces are distributed to the mammary gland. In females, during lactation, these branches are of large size. The musculo-phrenic artery is directed obliquely downwards and outwards,AETERIES 568 behind the cartilages of the false ribs, perforating the Diaphragm at the eighth or ninth rib, and terminating, considerably reduced in size, opposite the last inter- costal space. It gives off anterior intercostal arteries to each of the intercostal spaces across which it passes; these diminish in size as the spaces decrease in length, and are distributed in a manner precisely similar to the anterior intercostals from the internal mammary. The musculo-phrenic also gives branches to the lower part of the pericardium, and others which run backwards to the Diaphragm, and downwards to the abdominal muscles. The superior epigastric continues in the original direction of the internal mammary ; it descends through the cellular interval between the costal and sternal attachments of the Diaphragm, and enters the sheath of the Eectus abdominis muscle, at first lying behind the muscle, and then perforating it and supplying it, and anastomosing with the deep epigastric artery from the external iliac. Some vessels perforate the sheath of the Rectus, and supply the muscles of the abdomen and the integument, and a small branch, which passes inwards upon the side of the ensiform appendix, anastomoses in front of that cartilage with the artery of the opposite side. Surgical Anatomy.—The course of the internal mammary artery may be defined by drawing a line across the six upper intercostal spaces, half an inch from and parallel Math the sternum. The position of the vessel must be remembered, as it is liable to be wounded in stabs of the chest-wall. It is most easily reached by a transverse incision in the second intercostal space. The Superior Intercostal (fig. 352) arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the Anterior scalenus on the right side, and to the inner side of the muscle on the left side. Passing backwards, it gives off the deej^ cervical branch, and then descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the first two ribs, and inosculates with the first aortic intercostal.* In the first intercostal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distri- bution of the aortic intercostals. The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the aortic intercostal. Each intercostal gives off a branch to the posterior spinal muscles, and a small one which passes through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the spinal cord and its membranes. The deep cervical branch (profunda cervicis) arises, in most cases, from the superior intercostal, and is analogous to the posterior branch of an aortic inter- costal artery. Passing backwards, between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first rib, it runs up the back part of the neck, between the Complexus and Semispinalis colli muscles, as high as the axis, supplying these and adjacent muscles, and anastomosing with the deep branch of the arteria princeps cervicis of the occipital, and with branches which pass outwards from the vertebral. Anatomy of the Axilla The Axilla is a pyramidal space, situated between the upper and lateral part of the chest and the inner side of the arm. Boundaries.—Its apex, which is directed upwards towards the root of the neck, corresponds to the interval between the first rib, the upper edge of the scapula, and the clavicle, through which the axillary vessels and nerves pass. The base, directed downwards, is formed by the integument, and a thick layer of fascia, extending between the lower border of the Pectoralis major in front, and the lower border of the Latissimus dorsi behind; it is broad internally, at the chest, but narrow and pointed externally, at the arm. The anterior boundary is formed by the Pectoralis major and minor muscles, the former covering the whole of the anterior wall of the axilla, the latter covering only its central part. The posterior boundary, which extends somewhat lower than the anterior, is formed by the Sub- scapularis above, the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi below. On the inner side are the first four ribs with their corresponding Intercostal muscles, and part of the * See foot-note, p. 588.AXILLA 569 Serratus magnus. On the outer side, where the anterior and posterior boundaries converge, the space is narrow, and bounded by the humerus, the Coraco-brachahs and Biceps muscles. Contents.—This space contains the axillary vessels, and brachial plexus of nerves, with their branches, some branches of the intercostal nerves, and a large number of lymphatic glands, all connected together by a quantity of fat and loose areolar tissue. Their Position.—The axillary artery and vein, with the brachial plexus of nerves, extend obliquely along the outer boundary of the axillary space, from its apex to its base, and are placed much nearer the anterior than the posterior wall, the vein lying to the inner or thoracic side of the artery, and partially concealing it. At the fore part of the axillary space, in contact with the Pectoral muscles, are the thoracic branches of the axillary artery, and along the anterior margin of the axilla Fig. 362.—The axillary arterj^ and its branches. the long thoracic artery extends to the side of the chest. At the back part, in contact with the lower margin of the Subscapularis muscle, are the subscapular vessels and nerves ; winding around the lower border of this muscle is the dorsalis scapulae artery and veins ; and towards the outer extremity of the muscle, the posterior circumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve are seen curving backwards to the shoulder. Along the inner or thoracic side no vessel of any importance exists, the upper part of the space being crossed merely by a few small branches from the superior thoracic artery. There are some important nerves, however, in this situation, viz. the posterior thoracic or external respiratory nerve, descending on the surface of the Serratus magnus, to which it is distributed ; and perforating the upper and anterior part of this wall, the intercosto-humeral nerve or nerves, passing across the axilla to the inner side of the arm.AETEEIES 570 The cavity of the axilla is filled by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, and a large number of small arteries and veins, all of which are, however, of inconsiderable size, and numerous lymphatic glands : these are from ten to twelve in number, and situated chiefly on the thoracic side, and lower and back part of this space. Surgical Anatomy.—The axilla is a space of considerable surgical importance. It transmits the large vessels and nerves to the upper extremit}^ and these may be the seat of injury or disease : it contains numerous lymphatic glands which may require removal when diseased; in it is a quantity of loose connective and adipose tissue which may be readil}" infiltrated with blood or inflammatory exudation, and it may be the seat of rapidly growing tiunours. Moreover, it is covered at its base by thin skin, largely supplied with sebaceous and sweat glands, which is frequently the seat of small cutaneous abscesses and boils, and of eruptions due to irritation. In suj^pm^ation in the axilla, the arrangement of the fasciae plays a very important part in the direction which the pus takes. As described on page 446, the costo-coracoid membrane, after covering in the space between the clavicle and the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, splits to enclose this muscle, and, reblending at its lower border, becomes incorporated with the fascia covering the Pectoralis major muscle at the anterior fold of the axilla. This is known as the clavi-pectoral fascia. Suppuration may take place either superficial to or beneath this layer of fascia; that is, either between the pectorals or below the pectoralis minor: in the former case, it would point either at the anterior border of the axillary fold, or in the groove between the Deltoid and the Pectoralis major ; in the latter, the pus would have a tendency to surround the vessels and nerves, and ascend into the neck, that being the direction in which there is least resistance. Its progress towards the skin is prevented by the axillary fascia; its progress backwards, by the Serratus magnus ; forwards, by the clavi-pectoral fascia; inwards, by the wall of the thorax; and outwards, by the upper limb. The pus in these cases, after extending into the neck, has been known to spread through the superior opening of the thorax into the media- stinum. In opening an axillary abscess, the knife should be entered in the floor of the axilla, midwaj^ between the anterior and posterior margins and near the thoracic side of the space. It is well to use a director and dressing forceps, after an incision has been made through the skin and fascia in the manner directed by the late Mr. Hilton. The student should attentively consider the relation of the vessels and nerves in the several parts of the axilla ; for it not unfrequently happens that the surgeon is called upon to extirpate diseased glands, or to remove a tumour from this situation. In performing such an operation, it wiU be necessary to proceed with much caution in the direction of. the outer wall and apex of the space, as here the axillary vessels will be in danger ot being wounded. Towards the posterior wall, it will be necessary to avoid the subscapular, dorsalis scapulae, and posterior circumflex vessels. Along the anterior wall, it will be necessary to avoid the thoracic branches. It is only along the inner or thoracic wall, and in the centre of the axillary cavity, that there are no vessels of any importance ; a for- tunate circumstance, for it is in this situation more especially that tumours requiring removal are usually situated. The Axillary Artery The Axillary Artery, the continuation of the subclavian, commences at the lower border of the first rib, and terminates at the lower border of the tendon of the Teres major muscle, where it takes the name of brachial. Its direction varies with the position of the limb : when the arm lies by the side of the chest, the vessel forms a gentle curve, the convexity being upwards and outwards ; when it is directed at right angles with the trunk, the vessel is nearly straight; and when it is elevated still higher, the artery describes a curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. At its commencement the artery is very deeply situated, but near its termination is superficial, being covered only by the skin and fascia. The description of the relations of this vessel is facilitated by its division into three portions : the first portion being that above the Pectoralis minor; the second portion, behind; and the third below, that muscle. The first portion of the axillary artery is in relation, m fro7it, with the clavi- cular portion of the Pectoralis major, the costo-coracoid membrane, the external anterior thoracic nerve, and the acromio-thoracic and cephalic veins ; beJmid, with the first intercostal space, the corresponding Intercostal muscle, the second and third serrations of the Serratus magnus, and the posterior thoracic nerve; on its otiter side, with the brachial plexus, from which it is separated by a little cellular interval; on its iimer, or thoracic side, with the axillary vein.571 AXILLAEY Eelattons of the First Portion of the Axillary Artery In front.

The third portion of the axillary artery lies below the Pectoralis minor. It is in relation, in front, with the lower part of the Pectoralis major above, being covered only by the integument and fascia below, where it is crossed by the inner head of the median nerve ; behind, with the lower part of the Subscapularis, and the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major; on its oiiter side, with the Coraco-brachialis; on its hmer, or thoracic side, with the axillary vein. The nerves of the brachial plexus bear the following relation to the artery in this part of its course : on the outer side is the median nerve, and the musculo- cutaneous for a short distance; on the inner side, the ulnar, the internal, and lesser internal cutaneous nerves; and behind, the musculo-spiral and circumflex, the latter extending only to the ' ower border of the Subscapularis muscle. Peculiarities.—The axillary artery, in about one case out of every ten, gives off a large branch, which forms either one of the arteries of the forearm, or a large muscular trunk. In the first set of cases, this artery is most frequently the radial (i in 33), sometimes the ulnar (i in 72), and, very rarely, the interosseous (i in 506). In the second set of cases, the trunk has been found to give origin to the subscapular, circumflex, and profunda arteries of the arm. Sometimes, only one of the circumflex, or one of the profunda arteries, arose from the trunk. In these cases the brachial plexus surrounded the trunk of the branches, and not the main vessel.

Surface Marlxing.—The course of the axillary artery may be marked out by raising the arm to a right angle and drawing a line from the middle of the clavicle to the point where the tendon of the Pectoralis major crosses the prominence caused by the Coraco- brachialis as it emerges from under cover of the anterior fold of the axilla. The third portion of the artery can be felt pulsating beneath the skin and fascia, at the junction of the anterior with the middle third of the space between the anterior and posterior folds of the axilla, close to the inner border of the Coraco-brachialis. Surgical Anatomy.—The student, having carefully examined the relations of the axillary artery in its various parts, should now consider m what situation compression of this vessel may be most easily effected, and the best position for the api)lication of a ligature to it when necessary. Compression of the vessel may be required in the removal of tumours, or in amputa- tion of the upper part of the arm ; and the only situation in which this can be effectually made is in the lower part of its course; by pressing on it in this situation from within outwards against the humerus, the circulation may be effectually arrested. The axillary artery is perhaps more frequently lacerated than any other artery in the body, with the exception of the popliteal, by violent movements of the upper extremity, especially in those cases where its coats are diseased. It has occasionally been ruptured in attempts to reduce old dislocations o^-the shoulder-joint. This lesion is most likely to occur during the preliminary breaking down of adhesions, in consequence of the artery having contracted adhesions to the capsule of the joint. Aneurism of the axillary artery is of frequent occurrence : a large percentage of the cases being traumatic in their origin, due to the violence to wdiich it is exposed in the varied, extensive, and often violent movement of the limb. The application of a ligature to the axillary artery may be required in cases of aneurism of the upper part of the brachial, or as a distal operation for aneurism of the subclavian ; and there are only two situations in which it can be secured, viz. in the first and in the third parts of its course ; for the axillary artery at its central part is so deeply seated, and, at the same time, so closely surrounded with large nervous trunks, that the application of a ligature to it in that situation would be almost impracticable. In the third j^art of its course the operation is most simple, and may be performed in the following manner :—The patient being placed on a bed, and the arm separated from the side, with the hand supinated, an incision is made through the integument formmg the floor of the axilla, about two inches in length, a little nearer to the anterior than the posterior fold of the axilla. After carefully dissecting through the areolar tissue and fascia, the median nerve and axillary vein are exposed ; the former having been displaced to the outer, and the latter to the inner side of the arm, the elbow being at the same time bent, so as to relax the structures and facilitate their separation, the ligature may be passed round the artery from the ulnar to the radial side. This portion of the artery is occasionally crossed by a m^^scular slip derived from the Latissimus dorsi, which may mislead the surgeon during an operation. The occasional existence of this muscular fasciculus was spoken of in the description of the muscles. It may easily be recognised by the transverse direction of its fibres. The first jJortion of the axillary artery may be tied in cases of aneurism encroaching so far upwards that a ligature cannot be applied in the lower part of its course. Notwith- standing that this operation has been performed in some few cases, and with success, its performance is attended with much difficulty and danger. The student will remark that, in this situation, it would be necessary to divide a thick muscle, and, after separating the costo-coracoid membrane, the artery would be exposed at the bottom of a more or less deep space, with the cephalic and axillary veins in such relation with it as must render the application of a ligature to this part of the vessel particularly hazardous. Under such circumstances it is an easier, and, at the same time, more advisable operation, to tie the subclavian arterj^ in the third part of its course.AXILLARY 573 The vessel can be best secured by a curved incision with the convexity downwards from a point half an inch external to the Sterno-claviciilar joint to a point half an inch internal to the coracoid process. The limb is to be well abducted and the head inclined to the opposite side, and this incision carried through the superficial structures, care being taken of the cephalic vein at the outer angle of the incision. The clavicular origin of the Pectoralis major is then divided in the whole extent of the wound. The arm is now to be brought to the side, and the upper edge of the Pectoralis minor defined and drawn down- wards. The costo-coracoid membrane is to be carefully torn through with a director, close to the coracoid process, and the axillary sheath exposed ; this is to be opened with especial care on account of the vein overlapping the artery. The needle should be passed from below, so as to avoid wounding the vein. In a case of wound of the vessel, the general practice of cutting down upon, and tying it above and below the wounded point, should be adopted in all cases. Collateral Circulation after Ligature of the Axillary Artery.—If the artery be tied above the origin of the acromial thoracic, the collateral circulation will be carried on by the same branches as after the ligature of the subclavian ; if at a lower point, between the acromial thoracic and subscapular arteries, the latter vessel, by its free anastomoses with the other scapular arteries, branches of the subclavian, will become the chief agent in carrying on the circulation, to which the long thoracic, if it be below the ligature, will materially contribute, by its anastomoses with the intercostal and internal mammary arteries. If the point included in the ligature be below the prigin of the subscapular artery, it will most probably also be below the origins of the two circumflex arteries. The chief agents in restoring the circulation will then be the subscapular and the two circumflex arteries anastomosing with the superior profunda from the brachial, which will be after- wards referred to as performing the same office after ligature of the brachial. The cases in which the operation has been performed are few in number, and no published account of dissection of the collateral circulation appears to exist. The branches of the axillary artery are :— The superior thoracic is a small artery, which arises from the axillary sepa- rately, or by a common trunk with the acromial thoracic. Running forwards and inwards along the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, it passes between it and the Pectoralis major to the side of the chest. It supplies these muscles, and the parietes of the thorax, anastomosing with the internal mammary and intercostal arteries. The acromial thoracic is a short trunk, which arises from the fore part of the axillary artery. Projecting forwards to the upper border of the Pectoralis minor, it divides into three sets of branches—thoracic, acromial, and descending. The thoracic branches, two or three in number, are distributed to the Serratus magnus and Pectoral muscles, anastomosing with the intercostal branches of the internal mammary. The acromial branches are directed outwards towards the acromion, supplying the Deltoid muscle, and anastomosing, on the surface of the acromion, with the suprascapular, and posterior circumflex arteries. The descending branch passes in the space between the Pectoralis major and Deltoid, in the same groove as the cephalic vein, and supplies both muscles. The artery also gives off a very small branch, the clavicular, which passes upwards to the Subclavius muscle. The long thoracic passes downwards and inwards along the lower border of the Pectoralis minor to the side of the chest, supplying the Serratus magnus, the Pectoral muscles, and mammary gland, and sending branches across the axilla to the axillary glands and Subscapularis ; it anastomoses with the internal mammary and intercostal arteries. The alar thoracic is a small branch, which supplies the glands and areolar tissue of the axilla. Its place is frequently supplied by branches from some of the other thoracic arteries. The subscapular, the largest branch of the axillary artery, arises opposite the lower border of the Subsca]3ularis muscle, and passes downwards and backwards along its lower margin to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it anastomoses with the long thoracic and intercostal arteries and with the posterior scapular, aARTEEIES 574 branch of the transversaUs colh, from the thyroid axis of the subclavian. About an inch and a half from its origin it gives off a large branch, the dorsalis scapulce, and terminates by supplying branches to the muscles in the neighbourhood. The dorsalis scapulae is given off from the subscapular about an inch from its origin, and is generally larger than the continuation of the vessel. It curves round the axillary border of the scapula, leaving the axilla through the space between the Teres minor above, the Teres major below, and the long head of the Triceps externally (fig. 361), and enters the infraspinous fossa, where it anastomoses with the posterior scapular and suprascapular arteries. In its course it gives off two sets of branches : one enters the subscapular fossa beneath the Subscapularis, which it supplies, anastomosing with the posterior scapular and suprascapular arteries ; the other is continued along the axillary border of the scapula, between the Teres major and minor, and, at the dorsal surface of the inferior angle of the bone, anastomoses with the posterior scapular. In addition to these, small branches are distributed to the back part of the Deltoid muscle and the long head of the Triceps, anastomosing with an ascending branch of the superior profunda of the brachial. The circumflex arteries wind round the neck of the humerus. The posterior circumflex (fig. 361), the larger of the two, arises from the back part of the axillary opposite the lower border of the Subscapularis muscle, and, passing backwards with the circumflex veins and nerve through the quadrangular space bounded by the Teres major and minor, the scapular head of the Triceps and the humerus, winds round the neck of that bone and is distributed to the Deltoid muscle and shoulder- joint, anastomosing with the anterior circumflex, and acromial thoracic arteries, and with the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. The anterior circumflex (figs. 361, 362), considerably smaller than the preceding, arises just below that vessel, from the outer side of the axillary artery. It passes horizontally outwards, beneath the Coraco-brachialis and short head of the Biceps, lying upon the fore part of the neck of the humerus, and, on reaching the bicipital groove, gives off an ascending branch which passes upwards along the groove to supply the head of the bone and the shoulder-joint. The trunk of the vessel is then continued outwards beneath the Deltoid, which it supplies, and anastomoses with the posterior circumflex artery. The Brachial Artery commences at the lower margin of the tendon of the Teres major, and, passing down the inner and anterior aspect of the arm, terminates about half an inch below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries.

Behindj it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda "artery intervening; and from the front of the bone below, by the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and by the Brachialis anticus. By its outer side, it is in Fig. 363.— The surgical anatomy of the brachial artery. relation with the commencement of the median nerve, and the Coraco- brachialis and Biceps muscles, which slightly overlap the artery. By its inner side, its upper half is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its lower half with the median nerve. The basilic vein lies on the inner side of the artery, but is separated from it in the lower part of the arm by the deep fascia. It is accom- panied by two venffi comites, which lie in close contact witlg, the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating branches. Bend of the Elbow At the bend of the elbow the brachial artery sinks deeply into a triangular interval, the base of which is directed upwards towards the humerus, and the sides of which are bounded, externally, by the Supinator longus ; internally, by the Pronator radii teres ; its floor is formed by the Brachialis anticus and Supinator brevis. This space contains the brachial artery, with its accompanying veins ; the radial and ulnar arteries ; the median and musculo-spiral nerves; and the tendon of the Biceps. The brachial artery occupies the middle line of this space, and divides opposite the neck of the radius into the radial and ulnar arteries; it is covered, in front, by the integument, the superficial fascia, and the median basilic vein, the vein being separated from 'direct contact with the artery by the bicipital fascia. Behind, it Ues on the BrachiaHs anticus, which separates it from the elbow-joint. The median nerve Kes on the inner side of the artery, close to it above ; but separated from it below by the coronoid head of the Pronator radii teres. The tendon of the Biceps Hes to the outer side of the space, and the musculo-spiral nerve still more externally, lying upon the Supinator brevis, and partly concealed by the Supinator longus.AETEEIES 576 Peculiarities of the Brachial Artery as regards its Course.—The brachial artery, accom- panied by the median nerve, may leave the inner border of the Biceps, and descend towards the inner condyle of the humerus, where it usually curves round a prominence of bone, to which it is connected by a fibrous band ; it then inclines outwards, beneath or through the substance of the Pronator radii teres muscle, to the bend of the elbow. The variation bears considerable analogy with the normal condition of the artery in some of the carnivora: it has been referred to, above, in the description of the humerus (page 222). As regards its Division..—Occasionally, the artery is divided for a short distance at its upper part into two trunks, which are united above and below. A similar' peculiarity occurs in the main vessel of the lower limb. The point of bifurcation may be above or below the usual point, the former condition being by far the more frequent. Out of 481 examinations recorded by Mr. Quain, some made on the right, and some on the left side of the body, in 386 the artery bifurcated in its normal position. In one case only was the place of division lower than usual, being two or three inches below the elbow-joint. 'In 94 cases out of 481, or about one in 5^, there were two arteries instead of one in some part, or in the whole of the arm.' There appears, however, to be no correspondence between the arteries of the two arms, with respect to their irregular division ; for in sixty-one bodies it occurred on one side only in forty-three; on both sides, in different positions, in thirteen; on both sides, in the same position, in five. The point of bifurcation takes place at different parts of the arm, being most frequent in the upper part, less so in the lower part, and least so in the middle, the most usual point for the application of a ligature ; under any of these circumstances, two large arteries would be found in the arm instead of one. The most frequent (in three out of four) of these peculiarities is the high division of the radial. That artery often arises from the inner side of the brachial, and runs parallel with the main trunk to the elbow, where it crosses it, lying beneath the fascia ; or it may perforate the fascia, and pass over the artery immediately beneath the integument. The idnar sometimes arises from the brachial high up, and then occasionally leaves that vessel at the lower part of the arm, and descends towards the inner condyle. In the forearm it generally lies beneath the deep fascia, superficial to the flexor muscles ; occa- sionally between the integument and deep fascia, and very rarely beneath the flexor muscles. The interosseous artery sometimes arises from the upper part of the brachial or axillary : as it passes down the arm, it lies behind the main trunk, and at the bend of the elbow regains its usual position. In some cases of high division of the radial, the remaining trunk (ulnar-interosseous) occasionally passes, together with the median nerve, along the inner margin of the arm to the inner condyle, and then passing from within outwards, beneath or through the Pronator radii teres, regains its usual position at the bend of the elbow. Occasionally, the two arteries representing the brachial are connected at the bend of the elbow by a short transverse branch, and are even sometimes reunited. Sometimes, long slender vessels, vasa aberrantia, connect the brachial or axillary arteries with one of the arteries of the forearm, or a branch from them. These vessels usually join the radial. Varieties in Muscular Belations.*—The brachial artery is occasionally concealed, in some part of its course, by muscular or tendinous slips derived from the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, Brachialis anticus, and Pronator radii teres muscles. Surface Marhing.—The direction of the brachial artery is marked, when the arm is extended and supinated, by a line drawn from the junction of the anterior and middle third of the space between the anterior and posterior folds of the axilla—that is to say, from the inner side of the prominence of the Coraco-brachialis muscle to the point mid- way between the condyles of the humerus which corresponds to the depression along the inner border of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps. In the upper part of its course the artery lies internal to the humerus, but below it is in front of that bone. Surgical Anatomy.—Compression of the brachial artery is required in cases of amputa- tion and some other operations in the arm and forearm ; and it will be observed, that it may be effected in almost any part of the course of the artery. If pressure is made in the upper part of the limb, it should be directed from within outwards ; and if in the lower part, from before backwards, as the artery lies on the inner side of the humerus above, and in front of it below. The most favourable situation is about the middle of the arm, where it lies on the tendon of the Coraco-brachialis on the inner flat side of the humerus. The application of a ligature to the brachial artery may be required in cases of wound of the vessel, and in some cases of wound of the palmar arch. It is also sometimes necessary in cases of aneurism oi the brachial, the radial, ulnar, or interosseous arteries. The artery may be secured in any part of its course. The chief guides in determining its position are the surface-markings produced by the inner margin of the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps, the known course of the vessel, and its pulsation, which shoidd be carefully felt for before any operation is performed, as the vessel occasionally deviates from its usual * See Struthers's Anatomical and Physiological Observations.BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL 577 position in the arm. In whatever situation the operation is performed, great care is necessary, on account of the extreme thinness of the parts covering the artery, and the intimate connection which the vessel has throughout its whole course with' important nerves and veins. Sometimes a thin layer of muscular fibre is met with concealing the artery; if such is the case, it must be cut across in order to expose the vessel. In the upper third of the arm the artery may be exposed in the following manner : The patient being placed horizontally upon a table, the affected limb should be raised from the side, and the hand supinated. An incision about two inches in length should be made on the inner side of the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and the subjacent fascia cautiously divided, so as to avoid wounding the internal cutaneous nerve or basilic vein, which sometimes runs on the surface of the artery as high as the axilla. The fascia having been divided, it should be remembered that the ulnar and internal cutaneous nerves lie on the inner side of the artery, the median on the outer side, the latter nerve being occasionally superficial to the artery in this situation, and that the venae comites are also in relation with the vessel, one on either side. These being carefully separated, the aneurism needle should be passed round the artery from the inner to the outer side. If two arteries are present in the arm, in consequence of a high division, they are usually placed side by side; and if they are exposed in an operation, the surgeon should endeavour to ascertain, by alternately pressing on each vessel, which of the two commu- nicates with the woimd or aneurism, when a ligature may be applied accordingly ; or if pulsation or haemorrhage ceases only when both vessels are compressed, both vessels may be tied, as it may be concluded that the two communicate above the seat of disease, or are reunited. It should also be remembered that two arteries may be present in the arm in a case of high division, and that one of these may be found along the inner intermuscular septum, in a line towards the inner condyle of the humerus ; or in the usual position of the brachial, but deeply placed beneath the common trunk ; a knowledge of these facts will suggest the precautions necessary in every case, and indicate the measures to be adopted when anomalies are met with. In the middle of the arm the brachial artery may be exposed by making an incision along the inner margin of the Biceps muscle. The forearm being bent so as to relax the muscle, it should be drawn slightly aside, and, the fascia being carefully divided, the median nerve will be exposed lying upon the artery (sometimes beneath); this being drawn inwards and the muscle outwards, the artery should be separated from its accom- panying veins and secured. In this situation the inferior profunda may be mistaken for the main trunk, especially if enlarged, from the collateral circulation having become established; this may be avoided by directing the incision externally towards the Biceps, rather than inwards or backwards towards the Triceps. The lower part of the brachial artery is of interest in a surgical point of view, on account of the relation which it bears to the veins most commonly opened in vene- section. Of these vessels, the median basilic is the largest and most j)rominent, and, consequently, the one usually selected for the operation. It should be remembered, that this vein runs parallel with the brachial artery, from which it is separated by the bicipital fascia, and that care should be taken, in opening the vein, not to carry the incision too deeply, so as to endanger the artery. Collateral Circulation.—After the application of a ligature to the brachial artery in the upper third of the arm, the circulation is carried on by branches from the circumflex and subscapular arteries, anastomosing with ascending branches from the superior profunda. If the brachial is tied below the origin of the profunda arteries, the circulation is main- tained hy the branches of the profundte, anastomosing with the recurrent radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries. In two cases described by Mr. South,* in which the brachial artery had been tied some time previously: in one ' a long portion of the artery had been obliterated, and sets of vessels are descending on either side from above the obliteration, to be received into others which ascend in a similar manner from below it. In the other, the obliteration is less extensive, and a single curved artery about as big as a crow-quill passes from the upper to the lower oj^en part of the artery.' The branches of the brachial artery are, the Superior Profunda. Inferior Profunda. Nutrient. ' Anastomotica Magna. Muscular. The superior profunda arises from the inner and back part of the brachial, just below the lower border of the Teres major, and passes backwards to the interval between the outer and inner heads of the Triceps muscle, accompanied by the * Chelius's Surgery, vol. ii. p. 254. See also White's engraving, referred to by Mr. South, of the anastomosing branches after ligature of the brachial, in White's Cases in Surgery. Porta also gives a case (with drawings) of the circulation after ligature of both brachial and radial.—Alterazioni Patoligiche delle Arterie. P P578 ARTERIES mnsculo-spiral nerve; it winds round the back part of the shaft of the humerus in the spiral groove, between the Triceps and the bone, to the outer side of the humerus, just a,bove the external condyle, where it divides into two terminal branches. One of these pierces the 'external intermuscular septum, and descends to the space between the Brachialis anticus and Supinator longus, where it anasto- moses with the recurrent branch of the radial artery ; while the other, the posterior articular, descends along the back of the external intermuscular septum to the back part of the elbow-joint, where it anastomoses with the posterior interosseous recurrent, and across the back of the humerus with the posterior ulnar recurrent, the anastomotica magna, and inferior profunda (fig. 366). The superior profunda supplies the Triceps muscle and gives off a nutrient artery to the upper end of the humerus. Near its commencement it sends off a branch which passes upwards between the external and long heads of the Triceps muscle to anastomose with the posterior circumflex artery ; and, while in the groove, a small branch which accompanies a branch of the musculo-spiral nerve through the substance of the Triceps muscle and ends in the Anconeus below the outer condyle of the humerus. The nutrient artery of the shaft of the humerus arises from the brachial, about the middle of the arm. Passing downwards, it enters the nutrient canal of that bone, near the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis muscle. The inferior profunda, of small size, arises from the brachial, a little below the middle of the arm ; piercing the internal intermuscular septum, it descends on the surface of the inner head of the Triceps muscle, to the space between the inner condyle and olecranon, accompanied by the ulnar nerve, and terminates by anasto- mosing with the posterior ulnar recurrent and anastomotica magna. It also supplies a branch to the front of the internal condyle, which anastomoses with the anterior ulnar recurrent. The anastomotica magna arises from the brachial, about two inches above the elbow-joint. It passes transversely inwards upon the Brachialis anticus, and, piercing the internal intermuscular septum, winds round the back part of the humerus between the Triceps and the bone, forming an arch above the olecranon fossa, by its junction with the posterior articular branch of the superior profunda. As this vessel lies on the Brachialis anticus, branches ascend to join the inferior profunda; and others descend in front of the inner condyle, to anastomose with the anterior ulnar recurrent. Behind the internal condyle an offset is given off which anastomoses with the inferior profunda and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries and supplies the Triceps. The muscular are three or four large branches, which are distributed to the muscles in the course of the artery. They supply the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, and Brachialis anticus muscles. The Anastomosis around the Elbow-joint (fig. 366).—The vessels engaged in this anastomosis may be conveniently divided into those situated in front and beJiind the internal and external condyles. The branches anastomosing in front of the internal condyle are:—-The anastomotica magna, the anterior ulnar recurrent, and the anterior terminal branch of the inferior profunda. Those behind the internal condyle are:—The anastomotica magna, the posterior ulnar recurrent, and the posterior terminal branch of the inferior profunda. The branches anastomosing in front of the external condyle are :■—The radial recurrent and one of the terminal branches of the superior profunda. Those behind the external condyle (perhaps more properly described as being situated between the external condyle and the olecranon) are :—The anastomotica magna, the interosseous recurrent, and one of the terminal branches of the superior profunda. There is also a large arch of anastomosis above the olecranon, formed by the interosseous recurrent, joining with the anastomotica magna and posterior ulnar recurrent (fig. 366). From this description it will be observed that the anastomotica magna is the vessel most engaged, the only part of the anastomosis in which it is not employed being that in front of the external condyle.579 RADIAL Eadial Artery The Radial Artery appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the brachial, but, in size, it is smaller than the ulnar. It commences at the bifurcation of the brachial, just below the bend of the elbow, and passes along the radial side of the forearm to the wrist; it then winds backwards, round the outer side of the carpus, beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb, and, finally, passes forwards between the two heads of the First dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand, where it crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar border of the hand, to form the deep palmar arch. At its termination, it inosculates with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. The relations of this vessel may thus be conveniently divided into three parts, viz. in the forearm, at the back of the wrist, and in the hand. Relations.—In the forearm, this vessel extends from opposite the neck of the radius, to the fore part of the styloid process, being placed to the inner side of the shaft of the bone above, and in front of it below. It is superficial throughout its entire extent, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fasciae, and slightly overlapped above by the Supinator longus. In its course downwards, it lies upon the tendon of the Biceps, the Supinator brevis, the radial origin of the Flexor sublimis digitorum, the Pronator radii teres, the Flexor longus pollicis, the Pronator quadratus, and the lower extremity of the radius. In the upper third of its course, it lies between the Supinator longus and the Pronator radii teres ; in its lower two-thirds, between the tendons of the Supinator longus and the Flexor carpi radialis. The radial nerve lies along the outer side of the artery in the middle third of its course ; and some filaments of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, after piercing the deep fascia, run along the lower part of the artery as it winds round the wrist. The vessel is accompanied by ven^e comites throughout its whole course. Plan of the Relations of the Radial Artery in the Forearm In front. Skin, superficial and deep fasciae. Supinator longus. At the wrist, as it winds round the outer side of the carpus, from the styloid process to the first interosseous space, it lies upon the external lateral ligament, and then upon the scaphoid bone and trapezium, being covered by the extensor tendons of the thumb, subcutaneous veins, some filaments of the radial nerve, and the integument. It is accompanied by two veins, and a filament of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. In the hand, it passes from the upper end of the first interosseous space, between the heads of the Abductor indicis or First dorsal interosseous muscle, transversely across the palm, to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, where it inosculates with the communicating branch from the ulnar artery, forming the deep palmar arch.

Peculiarities.—The origin of the radial artery, according to Quain, is, in nearly one case in eight, higher than usual; more frequently arising from the axil- lary or upper part of the brachial, than from the lower part of this vessel. The variations in the position of this vessel in the arm, and at the bend of the elbow, have been already mentioned. In the forearm it deviates less frequently from its position than the ulnar. It has been found lying over the fascia instead of heneath it. It has also been observed on the surface of the Supinator longus, instead of along its inner border ; and in turning round the wrist, it has been seen lying over, instead of beneath, the extensor tendons. Surface MarMng.—The posi- tion of the radial artery in the forearm is represented by a line drawn from the outer border of the tendon of the Biceps in the centre of the hollow in front of the elbow-joint with a straight course to the inner side of the fore part of the styloid process of the radius. Surgical Ana tomy.—The ra- dial artery is much exposed to injury in its lower third, and is frecpiently wounded by the hand being driven through a pane of glass, by the slipping of a knife or chisel held in the other hand, and such-like accidents. The injury is often followed by a traumatic aneurism, for which the old operation of laying open the sac and securing the vessel above and below is required. The operation of tying the radial artery is required in cases of wounds either of its trunk, or of some of its branches, or for aneurism : and it will be ob- served, that the vessel may be exposed in any part of its course through the forearm without the division of any muscular fibres. The operation in the middle or inferior third of the forearm is easily performed; but in the upper third, near the elbow, it is attended with some difficulty, from the greater depth of the vessel, and ft-om its being overlapped by the Supinator longus muscle. To tie the artery in the upper third, an incision three inches in length should be made Deep branch Siqierficialis voiceBRANCHES OF RADIAL 581 through the integument, in a Hne drawn from the centre of the bend of the elbow to the front of the styloid process of the radius, avoiding the branches of the median vein ; the fascia of the arm being divided, and the Supinator longus drawn a little outwards, the artery will be exposed. The venae comites should be carefully separated from the vessel, and the ligature passed from the radial to the ulnar side. In the middle third of the forearm the artery may be exposed by making an incision of the Supinator longus. In this situation, the Fig. 365.—Ulnar and radial arteries. Deep view. of similar length on the inner margin radial nerve lies in close relation with the outer side of the artery, and should, as well as the veins, be carefully avoided. In the lower third, the artery is easily secured by dividing the integu- ment and fascia in the interval between the tendons of the Supinator longus and Flexor carpi radialis muscles. The branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated. In the Forearm. Wrist. Radial Eecurrent. Muscular.

It ascends between the branches of the musculo-spiral nerve lying on the Supinator brevis, and then between the Supinator longus and Brachialis anticus, supplying these „ Anterior cat pal \ Superjictalis voLce- muscles and the eibow-jomt, and anastomosing with one of the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches are dis- tributed to the muscles on the radial side of the forearm. The anterior carpal is a small vessel which arises from the radial artery near the lower border of the Pronator quadratus, and, running- inwards in front of the radius, anastomoses with the anterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. From the arch thus formed, branches descend to supply the articulations of the wrist. The superficialis volae arises from the radial artery, just where this vessel is about to wind round the wrist. Running forwards, it passes between the muscles of the thumb, which it supplies, and sometimes anastomoses with the palmar Anastomotica magna Anterior ulnar recurrent Posterior ulnar recurrent MuscularAETEEIES 582 portion of the ulnar artery, completing the superficial palmar arch. This vessel varies considerably in size : usually it is very small, and terminates in the muscles of the thumb ; sometimes it is as large as the continuation of the radial. The posterior carpal is a small vessel which arises from the radial artery beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb ; crossing the carpus transversely to the inner border of the hand, it anastomoses with the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar, forming the posterior carpal arch, which is joined by the termination of the posterior interosseous artery. From this arch are given off descending branches, the dorsal interosseous arteries for the third and fourth interosseous S]3aces, which run forw^ards on the Third and Fourth dorsal interossei muscles and divide into dorsal digital branches which supply the adjacent sides of the middle, ring, and little fingers respectively, communicating with the digital arteries of the superficial palmar arch. At their origin they anastomose with the perforating branches from the deep palmar arch. The metacarpal (first dorsal interosseous branch.) arises beneath the extensor tendons of the thumb, sometimes with the posterior carpal artery; running forwards on the Second dorsal interosseous muscle, it communicates, behind, with the corresponding perforating branch of the deep palmar arch ; and, in front, it divides into two dorsal digital branches, which supply the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers, inosculating with the digital branch of the superficial palmar arch. The dorsales pollicis are two small vessels which run along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb. They arise separately, or occasionally by a common trunk, near the base of the first metacarpal bone. The dorsalis indicis, also a small branch, runs along the radial side of the back of the index finger, sending a few branches to the Abductor indicis. The princeps pollicis arises from the radial just as it turns inwards to the deep part of the hand; it descends between the Abductor indicis and Adductor obliquus pollicis, then between the Adductor transversus pollicis and Adductor obliquus pollicis, along the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, to the base of the first phalanx, where it divides into two branches, which run along the sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb, and form an arch on the under surface of the last phalanx, from which branches are distributed to the integument and pulp of the thumb. The radialis indicis arises close to the preceding, descends between the Abductor indicis and Adductor transversus pollicis, and runs along the radial side of the index finger to its extremity, where it anastomoses with the collateral digital artery from the superficial palmar arch. At the lower border of the Adductor transversus pollicis, this vessel anastomoses with the princeps pollicis, and gives a communicating branch to the superficial palmar arch. The perforating- arteries, three in number, pass backwards between the heads of the last three Dorsal interossei muscles, to inosculate with the dorsal inter- osseous arteries. The palmar interosseous, three or four in number, are branches of the deep palmar arch; they run forwards upon the Interossei muscles, and anastomose at the clefts of the fingers with the digital branches of the superficial arch. The palmar recurrent branches arise from the concavity of the deep palmar arch. They pass upwards in front of the wrist, supplying the carpal articulations and anastomosing with the anterior carpal arch. Ulnar Aetery The Ulnar Artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the brachial, commences a little below the bend of the elbow, and crosses obhquely the inner side of the forearm, to the commencement of its lower half ; it then runs along its ulnar border to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament on the radial side of the583 ULNAR pisiform bone, and immediately beyond this bone divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. Relations in the Forearm.—In its upper half, it is deeply seated, being covered by all the superficial flexor muscles, excepting the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; it is crossed by the median nerve, which lies to its inner side for about an inch, and it lies upon the Brachialis anticus and Flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the loioer half of the forearm, it lies upon the Flexor profundus, bemg covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fasciae, and is placed between the Flexor carpi ulnaris and Flexor sublimis digitorum muscles. It is accompanied by two venae comites ; the ulnar nerve lies on its inner side for the lower two- thirds of its extent, and a small branch from the nerve descends on the lower part of the vessel to the palm of the hand.

At the wrist (fig. 364), the ulnar artery is covered by the integument and fascia, and lies upon the anterior annular ligament. On its inner side is the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve lies at the inner side, and somewhat behind the artery. FecuUarities.—The ulnar artery has been found to vary in its origin nearly in the proportion of one in thirteen cases, in one case arising lower than usual, about two or three inches below the elbow, and in all other cases much higher, the brachial being a more frequent source of origin than the axillary. A^ariations in the position of this vessel are more fiequent than in the radial. AVhen its origin is normal, the com\se of the vessel is rarely changed. "When it arises high up, it is almost invariably superficial to the flexor muscles in the forearm, lying commonly beneath the fascia, more rarety between the fascia and integument. In a few cases, its position was subcutaneous in the upper part of the forearm, sabaponem-otic in the lower part. Surface Marhing.—On account of the curved direction of the ulnar arterj', the line on the surface of the body which indicates its course is sumev/hat comi^licated. First, draw a line from the front of the internal condyle of the humerus to the radial side of the pisiform bone ; the lower two-thirds of this line represents the com-se of the middle and lower third of the uhiar artery. Secondly, draw a line fi-om the centre of the hoUow in front of the elbow-jomt to the junction of the upper and middle third of the first line ; this represents the course of the upper third of the artery. Surgical Anatomy.—The api:)lication of a hgatui'e to this vessel is requh^ed m cases of wound of the artery, or of its branches, or in consequence of aneurism. In the upper half of the forearm, the artery is deeply seated beneath the superficial fiexor muscles, and the application of a ligatm-e in this situation is attended with some dilficulty. An incision is to be made in the course of a Ime drawn from the fi'ont of the mternal condyle of the hmnerus to the outer side of the pisiform bone, so that the centre of the incision is three fingers' breadth below the internal condyle. The skm and superficial fascia having been divided, and the deep fascia exposed, the white line which separates the Flexor carpi ulnaris fi^om the other flexor muscles is to be sought for, and the fascia mcised in this hue. The Flexor carpi idnaris is now to be carefuUy separated from the other muscles, when the idnar nerve will be exposed and must be drawn aside. Some little distance below the nerve, the artery will be found accompanied by its vense comites, and may be ligatirred by- passing the needle from within outwards. In the middle and lower third of the forearm,ARTERIES 584 this \ essel may be easily secured by making an incision on the radial side of the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris: the deep fascia being divided, and the Flexor carpi ulnaris and its companion mnscle, the Flexor sublimis, being separated from each other, the vessel will be exposed, accompanied by its vena^ coniites, the ulnar nerve lying on its inner side. The veins being separated from the artery, the ligature should be passed from the ulnar to the radial side, taking care to avoid the ulnar nerve. The branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged in the following groups:— /Anterior Ulnar Recurrent. I Posterior Ulnar Recurrent. Anterior Interosseous. Forearm. Interosseous , . I Posterior Interosseous. Muscular. Wrist, i ^i^^^^^io^^ Carpal. ( Posterior Carpal. Hand ' ^Superficial Palmar Arch. (Deep Palmar or Communicating. The anterior ulnar recurrent (fig. 365) arises immediately below the elbow- joint, passes upwards and inwards between the Brachialis anticus and Pronator radii teres, supplies those muscles, and, in front of the inner condyle, anastomoses with the anastomotica magna and inferior profunda. The posterior ulnar recurrent is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding. It passes backwards and inwards, beneath the Flexor sublimis, and ascends behind the inner condyle of the humerus. In the interval between this process and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending between the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve ; it supplies the neigh- bouring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and interosseous recurrent arteries (fig. 366). The interosseous artery (fig. 365) is a short trunk about an inch in length, and of considerable size, which arises immediately below the tuberosity of the radius, and, passing backwards to the upper border of the interosseous membrane, divides into two branches, the anterior a^iid j^osterior interosseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, to which it is connected by a thin aponeurotic arch. It is accompanied by the interosseous branch of the median nerve, and overlapped by the contiguous margins of the Flexor profundus digitorum and Flexor longus pollicis muscles, giving oft' in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient arteries of the radius and ulna. At the upper border of the Pronator quadratus, a branch descends beneath the muscle, to anastomose in front of the carpus wdth branches from the anterior carpal and deep palmar arch. The continuation of the artery passes behind the Pronator quadratus, and, piercing the interosseous membrane, gets to the back of the forearm, and anastomoses with the posterior interosseous artery (fig. 366). It then descends to the back of the wrist to join the posterior carpal arch. The anterior interosseous gives off a long, slender branch, the median artery, which accompanies the median nerve, and gives oft'sets to its substance. This artery is sometimes much enlarged. It also gives oft* nutrient branches to the radius and ulna about the middle of the forearm. The posterior interosseous artery passes backwards through the interval between the oblique ligament and the upper border of the interosseous membrane. It appears between the contiguous borders of the Supinator brevis and the Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and runs down the back part of the forearm, between the superficial and deep layer of muscles, to both of which it distributes branches. At the lower part of the forearm it anastomoses with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery. Then, contmuing its course over the head of the ulna, it joins the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery. This artery gives oft", near its origin, the interosseous recurrent hrancli. The interosseous recurrent artery is a large vessel Avhich ascends to the interval between the external condyle and olecranon, on or through the fibres of theBRANCHES OF ULNAR 585 Fig. -,66.- - Arteries of the back of the forearm and hand.

The muscular branches are distributed to the nniscles along- the ulnar side of the forearm. The anterior carpal is a small vessehvhich crosses the front of the carpus be- neath the tendcMts of the Flexor profundus, and in- osculates with a ecu-respond- ing- branch of the radial artery. The posterior carpal arises innnediately above thv pisiform bone, and winds backwards beneath the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris; it passes across the dorsal surface of the carpus beneath the extensor tendons, anasto- mosing with a correspond- ing branch of the radial artery, and forming the jjostcfior cai-jhil torli. Im- mediately after its origin, it gives off a small branch, which runs along the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, forming- one of the 'DU'taCiUjhil ar- teries, and supplies the ulnar side of the dorsal surface of the little linger. The deep palmar or communicating" branch (tig. 365) passes deeply inwards between the Ab- ductor minimi digiti and Flexor brevis minimi digiti, near their origins ; it ana- stomoses with the termi- nation of the radial artery, completing the deep palniar arch. The Superficial Palmar Arch. — The superficial palmar arch passes out- wards across the \w\m of the hand, describing a curve, with its convexity forwards, to the space be- tween the ball of the thumb and the index linger, wlun-e the arch is completed by its anastomosing with a branch from the radialis indicis, though sometimes the arch is completed by its anastomosing with the superticialis vobe branch of the radial artery.

The digital branches (fig. 364), four in number, are given oft* from the con- vexity of the superficial palmar arch. They supply the ulnar side of the little finger, and the adjoining sides of the little, ring, middle, and index fingers; the radial side of the index finger and thumb being supplied from the radial artery. The digital arteries at first lie superficial to the flexor tendons, but as they pass forwards with the digital nerves to the clefts between the fingers, they lie between them, and are there joined by the interosseous branches from the deep palmar arch. The digital arteries on the sides of the fingers lie beneath the digital nerves; and, about the middle of the last phalanx, the two branches for each finger form an arch, from the convexity of which branches pass to supply the pulp of the finger. Surface MarMng.—The superficial palmar arch is represented by a curved line, starting from the outer side of the pisiform bone, and carried downwards as far as the middle third of the palm, and then curved outwards on a level with the upper end of the cleft between the thumb and index finger. The deep palmar arch is situated about half an inch nearer to the carpus. Surgical Anatomy.—Wounds of the palmar arches are of special interest, and are always difficult to deal with. When the wound in the superficial tissues is extensive, it may be possible to secure the bleeding ends of the vessel; but when there is a small punctured wound, as from a penknife or piece of glass, pressure systematically applied is probably the best course of treatment, as there is difticulty in reaching the wounded vessel without damaging important structures. At the same time it must be admitted that pressure applied to the palm of the hand, to arrest haemorrhage from a wound of one of the palmar arches, especially the deep arch, is apt to be followed by sloughing, owing to the rigidity of the parts and the facility with which a considerable amount of pressure can be aj)plied. In wounds of the deep palmar arch, a ligature may be applied to the bleeding points, from the dorsum of the hand, by resection of the upper part of the third metacarpal bone. It is useless in these cases to ligature one of the arteries of the forearm alone, and indeed simultaneous ligature of both radial and ulnar arteries above the wrist is often unsuccessful, on account of the anastomosis carried on by the carpal arches. Therefore, upon the failure of pressure to arrest haemorrhage, it is expedient to apply a ligature to the brachial artery.587 THORACIC AORTA ARTERIES OF THE TRUNK The Descending Aorta The Descending Aorta is divided into two portions, the thoracic and abdominal, in correspondence with the two great cavities of the trunk in which it is situated. The Thoracic Aorta commences at the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra, on the left side, and terminates at the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, in front of the last dorsal vertebra. At its commencement, it is situated on the left side of the spine ; it approaches the median line as it descends ; and, at its termination, lies directly in front of the column.^ The direction of this vessel being influenced by the spine, upon which it rests, it describes a curve which is concave forwards in the dorsal region. As the branches given off from it are small, the diminution in the size of the vessel is inconsiderable. It is contained in the back part of the posterior mediastinum. Relations.—It is in relation, in front, from above downwards, with the left pulmonary artery, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the oesophagus; behind, with the vertebral column, and the vena azygos minor ; on the right side, with the vena azygos major, and thoracic duct; on the left side, with the left pleura and lung. The oesophagus, with its accompanying nerves, lies on the right side of the aorta above ; but at the lower part of the thorax it gets in front of the aorta, and close to the Diaphragm is situated to its left side.

Pleura. Left lung. (Esophagus (below). Behind. Vertebral column. Vena azygos minor. The aorta is occasionally found to be obliterated at a particular spot, viz. at the junction of the arch with the thoracic aorta, just below the ductus arteriosus. Whether this is the result of disease, or of congenital malformation, is immaterial to our present purpose ; it affords an interesting opportunity of observing the resources of the collateral circulation. The course of the anastomosing vessels, by which the blood is brought from the upper to the lower part of the artery, will be found well described in an account of two cases in the Pathological Transactions, vols. viii. and x. In the former (p. 162), Mr. Sydney Jones tlius sums up the detailed description of the anastomosing vessels :—' The principal communications by which the circulation was carried on, were—Firstly, the internal mammary, anastomosing with the intercostal arteries, with the phrenic of the abdominal aorta by means of the musculo-phrenic and comes nervi phrenici, and largely with the deep epigastric. Secondly, the superior intercostal, anastomosing anteriorly by means of a large branch with the first aortic intercostal, and posteriorly with the posterior branch of the same artery. Thirdly, the inferior thyroid, by means of a branch about the size of an ordinary radial, formed a communication with the first aortic intercostal. Fourthly, the transversalis colli, by means of very large communications with the posterior branches of the intercostals. Fifthly, the branches (of the subclavian and axillary) going to the side of the chest were large, and anastomosed freely with the lateral branches of the intercostals.' In the second case also (vol. x. p. 97), Mr. Wood describes the anastomoses in a somewhat similar manner, adding the remark, that ' the blood which was brought into the aorta through the anastomoses of the intercostal arteries appeared to be expended principally in supplying the abdomen and pelvis; while the supply to the lower extremities had passed through the internal mammary and epigastrics.'AETERIES 588 Surgical Anatomy.—The student should now consider the effects hkely to be produced by aneurism of the thoracic aorta, a disease of common occurrence. When we consider the great depth of the vessel from the surface, and the number of important structures which surround it on every side, it may easily be conceived what a variety of obscure symptoms may arise from disease of this part of the arterial system, and how they may be liable to be mistaken for those of other affections. Aneurism of the thoracic aorta most usually extends backwards, along the left side of the spine, producing absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, with curvature of the spine ; whilst the irritation or pressure on the cord will give rise to pain, either in the chest, back, or loins, with radiating pain in the left upper intercostal spaces, from pressure on the intercostal nerves; at the same time the tumour may project backwards on each side of the spine, beneath the integu- ment, as a pulsating swelling, simulating abscess connected with diseased bone ; or it may displace the oesophagus, and compress the lung on one or the other side. If the tumour extend forward, it may press upon and displace the heart, giving rise to palpitation and other symptoms of disease of that organ; or it may displace, or even compress, the oesophagus, causing pain and difficulty of swallowing, as in stricture of that tube; and ultimately even open into it by ulceration, producing fatal haemorrhage. If the disease extends to the right side, it may press upon the thoracic duct; or it may burst mto the pleural cavity, or into the trachea or lung; and lastly, it ma}^ open into the posterior mediastinum. The pericardiac are a few small vessels, irregular in their origin, distributed to the pericardium. The bronchial arteries are the nutrient vessels of the lungs, and vary in number, size, and origin. That of the right side arises from the first aortic intercostal, or by a common trunk with the left bronchial, from the front of the thoracic aorta. Those of the left side, usually two in number, arise from the thoracic aorta, one a little lower than the other. Each vessel is directed to the back part of the corresponding bronchus along which it runs, dividing and subdividing upon the bronchial tube, supplying them, the cellular tissue of the lungs, the bronchial glands, and the oesophagus. The cesophag'eal arteries, usually four or five in number, arise from the front of the aorta, and pass obliquely downwards to the oesophagus, forming a chain of anastomoses along that tube, anastomosing with the oesophageal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries above, and with ascending branches from the phrenic and gastric arteries below. The posterior mediastinal arteries are numerous small vessels which supply the glands and loose areolar tissue in the mediastinum. The Intercostal arteries arise from the back part of the aorta. They are usually eleven in number on each side, the superior intercostal space being supplied by the superior intercostal, a branch of the subclavian, and the second intercostal space being supplied by a branch from the superior intercostal joining Avith the first aortic intercostal. The lowest of these branches, the subcostal artery, underlies the last rib. The right intercostals are longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta on the left side of the spine : they pass outwards, across the bodies of the vertebras, to the intercostal spaces, being covered by the pleura, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, sympathetic nerve, and the vena azygos major; the left passing beneath the superior intercostal vein, the vena azygos minor, and sympathetic. In the intercostal spaces, each artery divides into two branches : an anterior, or proper intercostal branch ; and a posterior, or dorsal branch.* The anterior branch passes outwards, at first lying upon the External inter- * Mr. W. J. Walsham describes a small twig as being given off from each intercostal, close to its origin. He states that they can be traced running between the neck of the rib and the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra ; they anastomose with similar twigs given oti' from the intercostal arterj^ next below. In the first and second s^iaces similar anastomosing twigs are given otf from the superior intercostal.—Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xvi. j)art iii. p. 443.

It then passes between the two layers of Intercostal muscles, and having ascended obliquely to the lower border of the rib above, divides, near the angle of that bone, into two branches: of these the larger runs in the groove, on the lower border of the rib above; the smaller branch along the upper border of the rib below; passing forward, they supply the Intercostal muscles, and anastomose with the anterior intercostal branches of the internal mammary, and with the thoracic branches of Fig. 367.—The abtlominal aorta and its branches. the axillary artery. The first aortic intercostal anastomoses with the superior intercostal, and the last three pass between the abdominal muscles, inosculating with the epigastric in front, and with the phrenic and lumbar arteries. Each intercostal artery is accompanied by a vein and nerve, the former being above, and the latter below, except in the upper intercostal spaces, where the nerve is at first above the artery. The arteries are protected from pressure during the action of the Intercostal muscles, by fibrous arches thrown across, and attached by eachARTERIES 590 extremity to the bone. The lower mtercostal arteries are continued anteriorly from the intercostal spaces into the abdominal wall, except the last, the subcostal, which lies throughout its whole course in the abdominal wall, since it is placed below the last rib. They pass behind the costal cartilages between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscle to the sheath of the Rectus, where they anastomose with the internal mammary and the deep epigastric arteries. Behind, the subcostal artery anastomoses with the first lumbar artery. The posterior or dorsal branch of each intercostal artery passes backwards to the inner side of the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and divides into a muscular branch, which is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back, and a spinal branch w^hich enters the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina to be distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes, and to the bodies of the vertebrae in the same manner as the lateral spinal branches from the vertebral. The Abdominal Aoeta (fig. 367) The Abdominal Aorta commences at the aortic opening of the Diaphragm, in front of the body of the last dorsal vertebra, and, descending a little to the left side of the vertebral column, terminates on the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, commonly a little to the left of the middle line,* where it divides into the two common iliac arteries. It diminishes rapidly in size, in consequence of the many large branches which it gives off. As it lies upon the bodies of the vertebrse, the curve which it describes is convex forwards, the greatest convexity corresponding to the third lumbar vertebra, which is a little above and to the left side of the umbilicus. Relations.—It is covered, in front, by the lesser omentum and stomach, behind which are the branches of the coeliac axis, and the solar plexus; below these, by the splenic vein, the pancreas, the left renal vein, the transverse portion of the duodenum, the mesentery, and aortic plexus. Behind, it is separated from the lumbar vertebrae by the left lumbar veins, the receptaculum chyli, and thoracic duct. On the right side, it is in relation with the inferior vena cava (the right crus of the Diaphragm bemg interposed above), the vena azygos major, thoracic duct, and right semilunar ganglion ; on the left side, with the sympathetic nerve, and left semilunar ganglion.

Holmes, 2nd ed. vol. v. p. 652.ABDOMINAL AORTA 591 Surface Marhing.—In order to map out the abdominal aorta on the surface of the abdomen, a hne must be drawn from the middle line of the body, on a level with the distal extremity of the seventh costal cartilage, downwards and slightly to the left, so that it just skirts the umbilicus, to a zone drawn round the body opposite the highest point of the crest of the ilium. This point is generally half an inch below and to the left of the umbilicus, but as the position of this structure varies with the obesity of the individual, it is not a reliable landmark as to the situation of the bifurcation of the aorta. Surgical Anatomy.—-Aneurisms of the abdominal aorta near the coeliac axis communi- cate in nearly equal proportion with the anterior and posterior parts of the artery. When an aneurismal sac is connected with the back part of the abdominal aorta, it usually produces absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, and forms a pulsating tumour, that presents itself in the left hypochondriac or epigastric regions, and is accompanied by symptoms of disturbance in the alimentary canal. Pain is invariably present, and is usually of two kinds—a fixed and constant pain in the back, caused by the tumour pressing on or displacing the branches of the solar plexus and splanchnic nerves; and a sharp lancinating pain, radiating along those branches of the lumbar nerves which are pressed on by the tumour; hence the pain in the loins, the testes, the hj^pogastrium, and in the lower limb (usually of the left side). This form of aneurism usually bursts into the peritoneal cavity, or behind the peritoneum, in the left hypochondriac region; or it may form a large aneurismal sac, extending down as low as Poupart's ligament; hemorrhage in these cases being generally Yevy extensive, but slowly produced, and not rapidly fatal. When an aneurismal sac is connected with the front of the aorta near the coeliac axis, it forms a pulsating tumour in the left hypochondriac or epigastric regions, usually attended with symptoms of disturbance of the alimentary canal, as sickness, dyspepsia, or constipation, and accompanied by pain, which is constant, but nearly always fixed in the loins, epigastrium, or some part of the abdomen ; the radiating pain being rare, as the lumbar nerves are seldom implicated. This form of aneurism may burst into the peritoneal cavity, or behind the peritoneum, between the layers of the mesentery, or, more rarely, into the duodenum ; it rarely extends backwards so as to affect the spine. The abdominal aorta has been tied several times, and although none of the patients permanently recovered, still, as one of them lived as long as ten days, the possibility of the re-establishment of the circulation may be considered to be proved. In the lower animals this artery has been often successfully tied. The vessel may be reached in several ways. In the original operation, performed by Sir A. Cooper, an incision was made in the linea alba, the peritoneum opened in ft-ont, the finger carried down amongst the intestines, towards the spine, the peritoneum again opened behind, by scratching through the mesentery, and the vessel thus reached. Or either of the operations, described below, for securing the common iliac artery, may, by extending the dissection a sufficient distance upwards, be made use of to expose the aorta. The chief difficulty in the dead subject consists in isolating the artery, in consequence of its great depth ; but in the living subject, the embarrassment resulting from the proximit}^ of the aneurismal tumour, and the great probability of disease in the vessel itself, add to the dangers and difficulties of this formidable operation so greatly, that it is ver^^ doubtful whether it ought ever to be performed. The collateral circulation would be carried on by the anastomosis between the internal mammary and the deep epigastric ; by the free communication between the superior and inferior mesenteries, if the ligature were placed above the latter vessel; or by the anasto- mosis between the inferior mesenteric and the internal pudic, when (as is more common) the point of ligature is below the origin of the inferior mesenteric; and possibly by the anastomoses of the lumbar arteries with the branches of the internal iliac. The circulation through the abdominal aorta may be commanded, in thin persons, by firm pressure with the fingers. A tourniquet has been invented for this purpose, w.hich is sometimes used in amputation at the hip-joint and some other operations. Branches of the Abdominal Aorta Phrenic. f Gastric.

To expose this artery, raise the liver, draw down the stomach, and then tear through the laj^ers of the lesser omentum.

Cystic artery horizontally forwards (in the erect posture), divides into three large branches, the gastric, liepatic, and splenic, occasionally giving off one of the phrenic arteries.

On the right side, it is in relation with the right semilunar ganglion, and the lobus Spigelii; on the left side, with the left semilunar ganglion and cardiac end of the stomach. Beloiv, it rests upon the upper border of the pancreas. The Gastric Artery {Goronaria ventriculi), the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, passes upwards and to the left side, to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, distributing branches to the oesophagus which anastomose with the aortic oesophageal arteries; others supply the cardiac end of the stomach, inoscu- lating with branches of the splenic artery : it then passes from left to right, along593 C(ELIAC AXIS the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pylorus, lying in its course between the layers of the lesser omentum, and giving branches to both surfaces of the organ : at its termination it anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The Hepatic Artery in the adult is intermediate in size between the gastric and splenic ; in the foetus, it is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis. It is first directed forwards and to the right, to the upper margin of the pyloric end of the stomach, forming the lower boundary of the foramen of Winslow. It then passes upwards between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, which supply the corresponding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the vena portae and hepatic duct. The hepatic Fig. 369.- -The coeliac axis and its branches, the stomach having been raised, and the transverse meso-colon removed. artery, in its course along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the ductus communis choledochus and portal veins, the duct lying to the right of the artery, and the vena port^ behind. Its branches are, the Pyloric. Gastro-duodenalis Cystic. The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric arterv. QQ I Gastro-epiploica Dextra. Pancreatico-duodenalis Superior.AETEKIES 594 The gastro-duodenalis (fig. 369) is a short but large branch, which descends, near the pylorus, behind the first portion of the duodenum, and divides at the lower border of the stomach into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pcmcreatico-duodenalis superior. Previous to its division, it gives off two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of the stomach with the gastro-epiploica sinistra from the splenic artery. This vessel gives off numerous branches, some of which ascend to supply both surfaces of the stomach, whilst others descend to supply the great omentum. The pancreatieo-duodenalis superior descends between the contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric artery, and with the pancreatic branches of the splenic. The cystic artery (fig. 368), usually a branch of the right hepatic, passes upwards and forwards along the neck of the gall-bladder, and divides into two branches, one of which ramifies on its free surface, the other between it and the substance of the liver. The Splenic Artery, in the adult, is the largest of the three branches of the coeliac axis, and is remarkable for the extreme tortuosity of its course. It passes horizontally to the left side along the upper border of the pancreas, accompanied by the splenic vein, which lies below it; and, on arriving near the spleen, divides into branches, some of which enter the hilum of that organ to be distributed to its structure, whilst others are distributed to the great end of the stomach. Its branches are, the Pancreaticae Parvae. Gastric (Vasa Brevia). Pancreatica Magna. Gastro-epiploica Sinistra. The pancreatic are numerous small branches derived from the splenic as it runs behind the upper border of the pancreas, supplying its middle and left parts. One of these, larger than the rest, is given off from the splenic near the left extremity of the pancreas ; it runs from left to right near the posterior surface of the gland, following the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called the pancreatica magna. These vessels anastomose with the pancreatic branches of the pancreatico- duodenal arteries, derived from the hepatic on the one hand and superior mesenteric on the other. The gastric (vasa brevia) consists of from five to seven small branches, which arise either from the termination of the splenic artery, or from its terminal branches; and, passing from left to right, between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, are distributed to the great curvature of the stomach ; anastomosing with branches of the gastric and gastro-epiploica sinistra arteries. The gastro-epiploica sinistra, the largest branch of the splenic, runs from left to right along the great curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, and anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica dextra. In its course it distributes several branches to the stomach, which ascend upon both surfaces; others descend to supply the omentum. SuPEEiOE Mesenteric Aktery (fig. 370) In order to expose this vessel, raise the great omentum and transverse colon, draw down the small intestines, and cut through the peritoneum where the transverse meso- colon and mesentery join : the artery will then be exposed, just as it issues from beneath the lower border of the pancreas. The Superior Mesenteric Artery supplies the whole length of the small intestine, except the first part of the duodenum ; it also supplies the caecum, ascending and transverse colon ; it is a vessel of large size, arising from the fore part of theSUPEEIOR MESENTERIC 595 aorta, about a quarter of an inch below the coeliac axis ; being covered at its origin by the splenic vein and pancreas. It passes forwards, between the pancreas and transverse portion of the duodenum, crosses in front of this portion of the intestine, and descends between the layers of the mesentery to the right iliac fossa, where it terminates, considerably diminished in size. In its course it forms an arch, the convexity of which is directed forwards and downwards to the left side, the concavity backwards and upwards to the right. It is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein, and is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are, the Inferior Pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic. Vasa Intestini Tenuis. Colica Dextra. Colica Media. The Inferior pancreatico-duodenal is given off from the superior mesenteric behind the pancreas, and is distributed to the head of the pancreas, with the transverse and descending portions of the duodenum; anastomosing with the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery. The vasa intestini tenuis arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are distributed to the jejunum and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery ; each vessel dividing into two branches, which unite with a Q Q 2AETERIES 596 similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches, the convexities of which are directed towards the intestine. From this first set of arches branches arise, which again miite with similar branches from either side, and thus a second series of arches is formed ; and from these latter, a third, and a fom'th, or even fifth series of arches is constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intestine. From the terminal arches numerous small straight vessels arise which encircle the intestine, upon which they are distributed, ramifying thickly between its coats. The ileo-colic artery is the lowest branch given off from the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery. It descends between the layers of the mesentery to the right iliac fossa, w^here it divides into two branches. Of these, the inferior one inosculates with the lowest branches of the vasa intestini tenuis, from the convexity of Avhich branches proceed to supply the termination of the ileum, the caecum and appendix cseci, and the ileo-Cffical valve. The superior division inosculates with the colica dextra, and supplies the commencement of the colon. The colica dextra arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery, and, passing behind the peritoneum to the middle of the ascending colon, divides into two branches : a descending branch, which inoscu- lates with the ileo-colic; and an ascending branch, which anastomoses Avith the colica media. These branches form arches, from the convexity of which vessels are distributed to the ascending colon. The branches of this vessel are covered with peritoneum only on their anterior aspect. The colica media arises from the upper part of the concavity of the superior mesenteric, and, passing forwards between the layers of the transverse meso-colon, divides into two branches : the one on the right side inosculating with the colica dextra; that on the left side with the colica sinistra, a branch of the inferior mesenteric. From the arches formed by their inosculation, branches are distributed to the transverse colon. The branches of this vessel lie between two layers of peritoneum. Infeeioe Mesenteric Aeteey (fig. 371) In order to expose this vessel, draw the small intestines and mesentery over to the right side of the abdomen, raise the transverse colon towards the thorax, and divide the peritoneimi covering the left side of the aorta. The Inferior Mesenteric Artery supplies the descending and sigmoid flexure of the colon, and the greater part of the rectum. It is smaller than the superior mesenteric; and arises from the left side of the aorta, between one and two inches above its division into the common iliacs. It passes downwards to the left iliac fossa, and then descends, between the layers of the meso-rectum, into the pelvis, under the name of the sujjerior hceinorrhoidal artery. It lies at first in close relation with the left side of the aorta, and then passes as the superior haemor- rhoidal in front of the left common iliac artery. Its branches are, the Colica Sinistra. Sigmoid. Superior Haemorrhoidal. The colica sinistra passes behind the peritoneum, in front of the left kidney, to reach the descending colon, and divides into two branches: an ascending branch, which inosculates with the colica media; and a descending branch, which anastomoses with the sigmoid artery. From the arches formed by these inoscula- tions, branches are distributed to the descending colon. The sigmoid artery runs obliquely downwards across the Psoas muscle to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and divides into branches which supply that part of the intestine ; anastomosing, above, with the coHca sinistra; and below, with the superior haemorrhoidal artery. This vessel is sometimes replaced by three or four small branches. The superior haemorrhoidal artery, the continuation of the inferior mesenteric, descends into the pelvis between the layers of the meso-rectum, crossing, in its597 INFEEIOR MESENTERIC course, the ureter, and left common iliac vessels. It divides into two branches, which descend one on each side of the rectum, and about five inches from the anus break up into several small branches, which are distributed between the mucous and muscular coats of that tube, nearly as far as its lower end ; anastomosing with each other, with the middle haemorrhoidal arteries, branches of the internal iliac, and with the inferior haemorrhoidal branches of the internal pudic. The Suprarenal Arteries (fig. 367) are two small vessels which arise, one on each side of the aorta, opposite the superior mesenteric artery. They pass obliquely upwards and outwards, over the crura of the Diaphragm, to the under surface of the suprarenal capsules, to which they are distributed, anastomosing with capsular Fig. 371.—The inferior mesenteric and its branches. branches from the phrenic and renal arteries. In the adult these arteries are of small size; in the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. The Renal Arteries are two large trunks, which arise from the sides of the aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. Each is directed outwards, across the crus of the Diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The right is longer than the left, on account of the position of the aorta; it passes behind the inferior vena cava. The left is somewhat higher than the right. Previously to entering the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches which are distributed to its substance. At the hilum, these branches lie between the renal vein and ureter, the vein being usually in front, the ureter behind. Each vessel gives off some small branches to the suprarenalARTERIES 598 capsule, the ureter, and the surrounding ceUular tissue and muscles. Frequently there is a second renal artery, which is given off from the abdominal aorta at a lower level and supplies the lower portion of the kidney. It is termed the inferior renal artery. The Spermatic Arteries are distributed to the testes in the male, and to the ovaria in the female. They are two slender vessels, of considerable length, which arise from the front of the aorta, a little below the renal arteries. Each artery passes obliquely outwards and downwards, behind the peritoneum, resting on the Psoas muscle, the right spermatic lying in front of the inferior vena cava, the left behind the sigmoid flexure of the colon. It then crosses obliquely over the ureter and the lower part of the external iliac artery to reach the internal abdominal ring, through which it passes, and accompanies the other constituents of the spermatic cord along the inguinal canal to the scrotum, where it becomes tortuous, and divides into several branches, two or three of which accompany the vas deferens, and supply the epididymis, anastomosing with the artery of the vas deferens; others pierce the back part of the tunica albuginea, and supply the substance of the testis. The Ovarian Arteries are shorter than the spermatic, and do not pass out of the abdominal cavity. The origin and course of the first part of the artery are the same as the spermatic in the male, but on arriving at the margin of the pelvis the ovarian artery passes inwards, between the two laminae of the broad ligament of the uterus, to be distributed to the ovary. One or two small branches supply the Fallopian tube; another passes on to the side of the uterus, and anastomoses with the uterine arteries. Other offsets are continued along the round ligament, through the inguinal canal, to the integument of the labium and groin. At an early period of foetal life, when the testes or ovaries lie by the side of the spine, below the kidneys, the spermatic or ovarian arteries are short; but as these organs descend from the abdomen into the scrotum, the arteries become gradually lengthened. The Phrenic Arteries are two small vessels, which present much variety in their origin. They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately above the coeliac axis, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta or from the coeliac axis. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries. In only one out of thirty-six cases examined did these arteries arise as two separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the Diaphragm, and then pass obliquely upwards and outwards upon its under surface. The left phrenic passes behind the oeso- phagus, and runs forwards on the left side of the oesophageal opening. The right phrenic passes behind the inferior vena cava, and ascends along the right side of the aperture for transmitting that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon each vessel divides into two branches. The internal branch runs forwards to the front of the thorax, sujoplying the Diaphragm, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, andAvith the musculo-phrenic and comes nervi phrenici, branches of the internal mammary. The external branch passes towards the side of the thorax, and inosculates with the intercostal arteries. The internal branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one some branches to the oesophagus. Each vessel also sends capsular branches to the suprarenal capsule of its own side. The spleen on the left side, and the liver on the right, also receive a few branches from these vessels. The Lumbar Arteries are analogous to the intercostal. They are usually four in number on each side, and arise from the back part of the aorta, nearly at right angles with that vessel. They pass outwards and backwards, around the sides of the body of the lumbar vertebra, behind the sympathetic nerve and the Psoas magnus muscle; those on the right side being covered by the inferior vena cava, and the two upper ones on each side by the crura of the Diaphragm. In the interval between the transverse processes of the vertebrae each artery divides into a dorsal and an abdominal branch.599 COMMON ILIAC The dorsal branch gives off, immediately after its origin, a spinal branch, which enters the spinal canal; it then continues its com^se backwards, between the trans- verse processes, and is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back, anastomosing with the similar branches of the adjacent lumbar arteries, and with the posterior branches of the intercostal arteries. The spinal branch enters the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen, to be distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes and to the bodies of the vertebrae in the same manner as the lateral spinal branches from the vertebral (see page 563). The abdominal branches pass outwards, having a variable relation to the Quadratus lumborum muscle. Most frequently the first branch passes in front of the muscle and the others behind it; sometimes the order is reversed and the lowest branch passes in front of the muscle. At the outer border of the Quadratus they are continued between the abdominal muscles, anastomose with branches of the epigastric |Lnd internal mammary in front, the intercostals above, and those of the ilio-lumbar and circumflex iliac heloiu. The Middle Sacral Artery is a small vessel, about the size of a crow-quill, which arises from the back part of the aorta, just at its bifurcation. It descends upon the last lumbar vertebra, and along the middle line of the front of the sacrum, to the upper part of the coccyx, where it anastomoses with the lateral sacral arteries, and terminates in a minute branch, which runs down to the situation of the body presently to be described as ' Luschka's gland,' From it, branches arise which run through the meso-rectum, to supply the posterior surface of the rectum. Other branches are given off on each side, which anastomose with the lateral sacral arteries, and send off small offsets, which enter the anterior sacral foramina. The artery is the representative of the caudal prolongation of the aorta of animals, and its lateral branches correspond to the intercostal and lumbar arteries in the dorsal and lumbar regions. Coccygeal Gland, or Luschka's Gland.—Lying near the tip of the coccyx in a small tendinous interval formed by the union of the Levator ani muscles of each side, and just above the coccygeal attachment of the Sphincter ani, is a small conglobate body, about as large as a lentil or a pea, first described by Luschka,* and named by him the coccygeal gland. Its most obvious connections are with the arteries of the part. Structure.—It consists of a congeries of small arteries with little aneurismal dilatations, derived from the middle sacral, and freely communicating with each other. These vessels are enclosed in one or more layers of polyhedral granular cells, and the whole structure is invested in a capsule of connective tissue which sends in trabeculae, dividing the interior into a number of spaces in which the vessels and cells are contained. Nerves pass into this little body from the sympathetic, but their mode of termination is unknown. Macalister believes the glomerulus of vessels ' consists of the condensed and convoluted metameric dorsal arteries of the caudal segments embedded in tissue which is possibly a small persisting fragment of the neurenteric canal.' Common Iliac Akteeies The abdominal aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries. The bifurca- tion usually takes place on the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. This point corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus, and is on a level with a line drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the other. The common iliac arteries are about two inches in length ; diverging from the termination of the aorta, they pass downwards and outwards to the margin of the pelvis, and divide opposite the intervertebral substance, between the last lumbar vertebra, * Der Hirnanliang ttnd die Steissdrilse des Menschen, Berlin, i860; Anatomie des Menschen, Tubingen, 1864, vol. ii. pt. 2, p. 187.6oo ARTEKIES and the sacrum, into two branches, the external and internal iliac arteries : the former supplying the lower extremity; the latter, the viscera and parietes of the pelvis. The right common iliac is somewhat larger than the left, and passes more obliquely across the body of the last lumbar vertebra. In front of it are the peritoneum, the small intestines, branches of the sympathetic nerve, and, at its point of division, the ureter. Behind, it is separated from the last lumbar vertebra by the two common iliac veins. On its outer side, it is in relation with the inferior vena cava, and the right common iliac vein, above ; and the Psoas magnus muscle below. The left common iliac is in relation, in front, with the peritoneum, branches of the sympathetic nerve, and the superior haemorrhoidal artery; and is crossed at its point of bifurcation by the ureter. The left common iliac vein lies partly on the inner side, and partly beneath the artery ; on its outer side, the artery is in relation with the Psoas magnus muscle. ^ Plan of the Eelations of the Common Iliac Artekies In front.

Branches.—The common iliac arteries give off small branches to the peritoneum, Psoas magnus, ureters, and the surrounding cellular tissue, and occasionally give origin to the ilio-lumbar, or renal arteries. Peculiarities.—The point of origin varies according to the bifurcation of the aorta. In three-fourths of a large number of cases, the aorta bifurcated either upon the fourth lumbar vertebra, or upon the intervertebral disc between it and the fifth ; the bifurcation being, in one case out of nine below, and in one out of eleven above this point. In ten out of every thirteen cases, the vessel bifurcated within half an inch above or below the level of the crest of the ilium : more frequently below than above. The jpom^ of division is subject to great variety. In two-thirds of a large number of cases it was between the last lumbar vertebra and the upper border of the sacrum ; being above that point in one case out of eight, and below it in one case out of six. The left common iliac artery divides lower down more frequently than the right. The relative length, also, of the two common iliac arteries varies. The right common iliac was the longer in sixty-three cases; the left in fifty-two; whilst they were both equal in fifty-three. The length of the arteries varied in five-sevenths of the cases examined, from an inch and a half to three inches; in about half of the remaining cases, the artery was longer, and in the other half, shorter : the minimum length being less than half an inch, the maximum four and a half inches. In two instances, the right common ihac has been found wanting, the external and internal iliacs arising directly from the aorta. Surface MarJcing.—Draw a zone round the body opposite the highest part of the crest of the ilium ; in this line take a point half an inch to the left of the middle line. From this draw two lines to points midway between the anterior superior spines of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. These two diverging lines will represent the course of the common and external iliac arteries. Draw a second zone romid the body corresponding to the level of the anterior superior spines of the ilium : the portion of the diverging lines between the two zones will represent the course of the common iliac artery ; the portion below the lower zone, that of the external iliac artery. Surgical Anatomy.—The application of a ligature to the common iliac artery may be601 COMMON ILIAC required on account of aneurism or hemorrhage, imphcating the external or internal ihacs. The artery may be tied by one of two incisions, i. An anterior or ihac incision, by which the vessel is approached more directly from the front; and 2. a posterior abdominal or lumbar incision, by which the vessel is reached from behind. If the surgeon select the ihac region, a curved incision, from live to eight inches in length according to the amount of fat, is made, commencing just outside the middle of Poupart's hgainent and a finger's breadth above it, and carried outwards towards the anterior superior iliac spine, then upwards towards the ribs, and finally curving inwards towards the umbihcus. The abdominal muscles and transversahs fascia are divided, and the peritoneum raised upwards and inwards, until the Psoas is reached. The arterv will be found on the inner side of this muscle, and is to be cleared with a director, especial care being taken on Fig. 372.—Arteries of the pelvis. the right-side a« here the common iliac veins lie behind the artery. The aneurism needle is to be passed from within outwards. But if the aneurismal tumour should extend high up in the abdomen, along the external iliac, it is better to select the posterior or lumbar, by making an incision partly in the abdomen, partly in the loin. The incision is commenced at the anterior extremity of the last rib, proceeding directly downwards to the ilium ; it is then curved forwards along the crest of the ilium, and a little above it to the anterior superior spine of that bone. The abdominal muscles having been cautiously divided in succession, the transversahs fascia must be carefully cut through, and the peritoneum, together with the ureter, separated from the artery, and pushed aside ; the sacro-iliac articulation must then be felt for, and upon it the vessel will be felt pulsating, and may be fully exposed in close connection with its accompanying A'ein. On the right side, both common iliac veins, as well as the inferior vena cava, are in close connection with the artery, and must be carefully avoided. On the left side, the vein usually lies onARTERIES 6o2 the inner side, and behind the artery ; but it occasionally happens that the two common iliac veins are joined on the left instead of the right side, Avhich would add much to the difficulty of an operation in such a case. The common iliac artery may be so short that danger may be apprehended h'om secondary haemorrhage if a ligature is applied to it. It would be preferable, in such a case, to tie both the external and internal iliacs near their origin. Collateral Circulation.—The principal agents in carrying on the collateral circulation after the application of a ligature to the common iliac are: the anastomoses of the hasmorrhoidal branches of the internal iliac with the superior haemorrhoidal from the inferior mesenteric ; the anastomoses of the uterine and ovarian arteries, and of the vesical arteries of opposite sides; of the lateral sacral with the middle sacral artery; of the epigastric with the internal mammary, inferior intercostal, and lumbar arteries ; of the circumflex iliac with the lumbar arteries; of the ilio-lumbar with the last lumbar artery ; of the obturator artery, by means of its pubic branch, with the vessel of the opposite side, and with the deep epigastric. Compression of the Common Iliac Arteries.—The common iliac arteries are most efficiently compressed by Davy's lever. The instrument consists of a gum-elastic tube, about two feet long, in which fits a round wooden ' lever ' considerablj^ longer than the tube. A small quantity of olive oil having been injected into the rectum, the gum-elastic tube, softened in hot water, is passed into the bowel sufficiently far to permit its pressing upon the common iliac artery as it lies in the groove between the last lumbar vertebra and the Psoas muscle. The wooden lever is then inserted into the tube, and the projecting end carried towards the opposite thigh and raised, when it acts as a lever of the first order, the anus being the fulcrum. In cases where the meso-rectum is abnormally short it may be impossible, without unjustifiable force, to compress the artery on the right side. Inteenal Iliac Arteey (fig. 372) The internal iliac artery supplies the walls and viscera of the pelvis, the generative organs, and inner side of the thigh. It is a short, thick vessel, smaller in the adult than the external iliac, and about an inch and a half in length. It arises at the point of bifurcation of the common iliac, and, passing downwards to the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, divides into two large trunks, an anterior and posterior ; from its point of bifurcation a partially obliterated cord, the hypogastric artery, extends forwards to the bladder. Relations.—In front, with the ureter, which separates it from the peritoneum. Behind, with the internal iliac vein, the lumbo-sacral nerve, and Pyriformis muscle. By its outer side, near its origin, with the Psoas magnus muscle. Plan of the Relations of the Inteenal Iliac Aeteey In front. Peritoneum. Ureter. Outer side. Psoas magnus. Behind. Internal iliac vein. Lumbo-sacral nerve. Pyriformis muscle. In the foetus, the internal iliac artery {hypogastric) is twice as large as the external iliac, and appears to be the continuation of the common iliac. Instead of dipping into the pelvis, it passes forwards to the bladder, and ascends along the sides of that viscus to its summit, to which it gives branches ; it then passes upwards along the back part of the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. Having passed through the umbilical opening, the two arteries twine round the umbilical vein, forming with it the umbilical cord ; and, ultimately, ramify in the placenta. The portion of theINTERNAL ILIAC 603 vessel within the abdomen is called the hyijogastric artery ; and that external to that cavity, the umbilical artery. At birth, when the placental circulation ceases, the upper portion of the hypogastric artery, extending from the summit of the bladder to the umbilicus, contracts, and ultimately dwindles to a solid fibrous cord ; but the lower portion, extending from its origin (in what is now the internal iliac artery) for about an inch and a half to the wall of the bladder, and thence to the summit of that organ, is not totally impervious, though it becomes considerably reduced in size, and serves to convey blood to the bladder, under the name of the superior vesical artery. Peculiarities as regards Length.—In two-thirds of a large number of cases, the length of the internal iliac varied between an inch and an inch and a half; in the remaining third, it was more frequently longer than shorter, the maximmii length being three inches, the minimum half an inch. The lengths of the common and internal iliac arteries bear an inverse proportion to each other, the internal iliac artery being long when the common iliac is short, and vice versa. As regards its Place of Division.—The place of division of the internal iliac varies between the upper margin of the sacrum and the upper border of the sacro-sciatic foramen. The arteries of the two sides in a series of cases often differed in length, but neither seemed constantly to exceed the other. Surgical A7iatoimj.—The application of a ligature to the internal iliac artery may be required in cases of aneurism or haemorrhage affecting one of its branches. The vessel may be secured by making an incision through the abdominal parietes in the iliac region, in a direction and to an extent similar to that for securing the common iliac ; the trans- versalis fascia having been cautiously divided, and the peritoneum pushed inwards from the iliac fossa towards the pelvis, the finger may feel the pulsation of the external iliac at the bottom of the woimd ; and, by tracing this vessel upwards, the internal iliac is arrived at, opposite the sacro-iliac articulation. It should be remembered that the vein lies behind, and on the right side, a little external to the artery, and in close contact with it ; the ureter and peritoneum, which lie in front, mast also be avoided. The degree of facility in appl^dng a ligature to this vessel will mainly depend ux^on its length. It has been seen that, in the great majority of the cases examined, the artery was short, varying from an inch to an inch and a half; in these cases, the artery is deeply seated in the pelvis ; when, on the contrary, the vessel is longer, it is found partly above that cavity. If the artery is very short, as occasionallj^ haj)pens, it would be preferable to apply a ligature to the common iliac, or upon the external and internal iliacs at their origin. Probably a better method of tying the internal iliac artery is by an abdominal section in the median line and reaching the vessel through the peritoneal cavity. This plan has been advocated b}" Dennis, of New York, on the following grounds: (i) It no way increases the danger of the operation; (2) it prevents a series of accidents which have occurred during ligature of the artery by the older methods; (3) it enables the surgeon to ascertain the exact extent of disease in the main arterial trunk, and select his spot for the application of the ligature; and (4) it occupies much less time. Collateral Circulation.—In Professor Owen's dissection of a case in which the internal ihac artery had been tied by Stevens ten years before death, for aneurism of the sciatic artery, the internal iliac was found impervious for about an inch above the point where the liga- ture had been applied ; but the obliteration did not extend to the origin of the external iliac, as the ilio-lumbar artery arose just above this point. Below the point of obliteration, the artery resumed its natural diameter, and continued so for half an inch ; the obturator, lateral sacral, and gluteal arising in succession from the latter portion. The obturator artery was entirely obliterated. The lateral sacral artery was as large as a crow's quill, and had a very free anastomosis with the artery of the opposite side, and with the middle sacral artery. The sciatic artery was entirely obliterated as far as its point of connection with the aneurismal tumour; but, on the distal side of the sac, it was continued down along the back of the thigh nearly as large in size as the femoral, being pervious about an inch below the sac by receiving an anastomosing vessel from the profunda.* The circulation was carried on by the anastomoses of the uterine and ovarian arteries; of the opposite vesical arteries; of the hsemorrhoidal branches of the internal iliac with those fi^om the inferior mesenteric ; of the obturator artery, by means of its pubic branch, with the vessel of the opposite side, and with the epigastric and internal circumflex; of the circumflex and perforating branches of the profunda femoris with the sciatic ; of the gluteal with the posterior branches of the sacral arteries ; of the ilio-lumbar with the last lumbar ; of the lateral sacral with the middle sacral; and of the circumflex iliac with the ilio-lumbar and gluteal. * Medico-Chirtirgical Trans., vol. xvi.6o4 AETERIES Branches of the Internal Iliac Fro7)i the Anterior Trunk.

The superior vesical is that part of the foetal hypogastric artery which remains pervious after birth. It extends to the side of the bladder, distributing numerous branches to the apex and body of the organ. From one of these a slender vessel is derived, which accompanies the vas deferens in its course to the testis, where it anastomoses with the spermatic artery. This is the artery of the vas deferens. Other branches supply the ureter. The middle vesical, usually a branch of the superior, is distributed to the base of the bladder and under surface of the vesiculae seminales. The inferior vesical arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac, frequently in common with the middle hsemorrhoidal, and is distributed to the base of the bladder, the prostate gland, and vesicul^ seminales. The branches distributed to the prostate communicate with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The middle hsemorrhoidal artery usually arises together with the preceding vessel. It supplies the rectum, anastomosing with the other hsemorrhoidal arteries. The uterine artery passes inwards from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac to the neck of the uterus. Ascending, in a tortuous course on the side of this viscus, between the layers of the broad ligament, it distributes branches to its substance, anastomosing, near its termination, with a branch from the ovarian artery. Branches from this vessel are also distributed to the bladder and ureter. The vaginal artery is analogous to the inferior vesical in the male ; it descends upon the vagina, supplying its mucous membrane, and sending branches to the neck of the bladder and contiguous part of the rectum. The Obturator Artery usually arises from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, frequently from the posterior. It passes forwards, below the brim of the pelvis, to the upper part of the obturator foramen, and escaping from the pelvic cavity through a short canal, formed by a groove on the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the os pubis, and the arched border of the obturator mem- brane, it divides into an internal and an external branch. In the pelvic cavity this vessel lies upon the pelvic fascia, beneath the peritoneum, and a little below the obturator nerve. Branches.—Within the ]jelvis, the obturator artery gives off an iliac branch to the iliac fossa, which supplies the bone and the Iliacus muscle, and anastomoses with the ilio-lumbar artery ; a vesical branch, which runs backwards to supply the bladder; and a imbic branch, which is given off from the vessel jiist before it leaves the pelvic cavity. This branch ascends upon the back of the os pubis, communicating with offsets from the deep epigastric artery, and with the corre- sponding vessel of the opposite side. This branch is placed on the inner side of the femoral ring. External to the yelvis, the obturator artery divides into an internal and an external branch, which are deeply situated beneath the Obturator externus muscle. The internal branch curves downwards along the inner margin of the obturator foramen, distributing branches to the Obturator externus muscle, Pectineus, Adductors, and Gracilis, and anastomoses with the external branch, and with the internal circumflex artery. In female \ Vaginal.605 INTERNAL PUDIC The external branch curves round the outer margm of the foramen, to the space between the Gemelkis inferior and Quadratus femoris, where it anastomoses with the sciatic artery. It supplies the Obturator muscles, anastomoses, as it passes backwards, with the internal branch and with the internal circumflex, and Fig. 373.—Variations in origin and course of obturator artery. sends a branch to the hip-joint through the cotyloid notch, which ramifies on the round ligament as far as the head of the femur. Peculiarities.—In two out of every three cases the obturator arises from the internal iliac; in one case in 3^ from the epigastric; and in about one in sevent^^-two cases by two roots from both vessels. It arises in about the same proportion from the external iliac artery. The origin of the obturator from the epigastric is not commonly found on both sides of the same body. When the obturator artery arises at the front of the pelvis from the epigastric, it descends almost vertically to the upper part of the obturator foramen. The artery in this course usually lies in contact with the external iliac vein, and on the outer side of the femoral ring (fig. 373, a) ; in such cases it would not be endangered in the operation for femoral hernia. Occasionally, however, it curves inwards along the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 373, B),and under such circumstances would almost completely encircle the neck of a hernial sac (supposing a hernia to exist in such a case), and would be in great danger of being wounded if an operation was performed. Fig. 374.—The internal pudic arter}^ and its branches in the male. The Internal Pudic is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, and supplies the external organs of generation. Though the course of the artery is the same in the two sexes, the vessel is much smaller in the female than in the male, and the distribution of its branches6o6 AETEEIES somewhat different. The description of its arrangement in the male will first be given, and subsequently the differences which it presents in the female will be mentioned. The Internal Pudic Artery in the Male passes downwards and outwards to the lower border of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and emerges from the pelvis between the Pyriformis and Coccygeus muscles : it then crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The artery now crosses the Obturator internus muscle, along the outer wall of the ischio- rectal fossa, being situated about an inch and a half above the lower margin of the ischial tuberosity. It is here contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia, and gradually approaches the margin of the ramus of the ischium, along which it passes forwards and upwards, pierces the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, and runs forwards along the inner margin of the ramus of the os pubis ; finally, it perforates the anterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, and divides into its two terminal branches, the dorsal artery of the ]jenis and the artery of the corpus ca,vernosum. Relations.—In the first part of its course, within the pelvis, it lies in front of the Pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus of nerves, and on the outer side of the rectum (on the left side). As it crosses the spine of the ischium, it is covered by the Gluteus maximus. In the pelvis, it lies on the outer side of the ischio-rectal fossa, upon the surface of the Obturator internus muscle, contained in a fibrous canal formed by the obturator fascia and the falciform process of the great sacro- sciatic ligament. It is accompanied by the pudic veins and the internal pudic nerve. Peculia7%ties.—The internal pudic is sometimes smaller than usual, or fails to give off one or two of its usual branches; in such cases, the deficiency is supplied by branches derived from an additional vessel, the accessory pudic, which generally arises from the internal pudic artery before its exit from the great sacro-sciatic foramen. It passes forwards along the lower part of the bladder and across the side of the prostate gland to the root of the penis, where it perforates the triangular ligament, and gives off the branches usually derived from the pudic artery. The deficiency most frequently met with is that in which the internal pudic ends as the artery of the bulb ; the arter}^ of the corpus cavernosum and arteria dorsalis penis being derived from the accessory pudic. Or the pudic may terminate as the superficial j)erineal, the artery of the bulb iDeing derived, with the other two branches, from the accessory vessel. Surgical Anatomy.-—The relation of the accessory pudic to the prostate gland and urethra is of the greatest interest in a surgical point of view, as this vessel is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy. The student should also study the position of the internal pudic artery and its branches, when running a normal course, with regard to the same operation. The superficial and the transverse perineal arteries are, of necessity, divided in this operation, but the haemorrhage from these vessels is seldom excessive; should a ligature be required, it can readily be applied on account of their superficial position. The artery of the bulb may be divided if the incision be carried too far forwards, and injury of this vessel may be attended with serious or even fatal consequences. The main trunk of the internal pudic artery may be wounded if the incision be carried too far outwards ; but, being bound down by the strong obturator fascia, and under cover of the ramus of the ischmm, the accident is not very likely to occur unless the vessel runs an anomalous course. Branches.— The branches of the internal pudic artery are :— The muscular branches consist of two sets : one given off in the pelvis ; the other, as the vessel crosses the ischial spine. The former are several small offsets which supply the Levator ani, the Obturator internus, the Pyriformis, and the Coccygeus muscles. The branches given off outside the pelvis are distributed to the adjacent part of the Gluteus maximus and External rotator muscles. They anastomose with branches of the sciatic artery. The inferior hsemorrhoidal are two or three small arteries which arise from Muscular. Inferior Hsemorrhoidal. Superficial Perineal. Transverse Perineal. Artery of the Bulb. Artery of the Corpus Cavernosum. Dorsal Artery of the Penis.607 SCIATIC the internal pudic as it passes above the tuberosity of the ischium. Crossing the ischio-rectal fossa, they are distributed to the muscles and integument of the anal region. The superficial perineal artery supplies the scrotum and muscles and integu- ment of the peringeum. It arises from the internal pudic, in front of the preceding branches, and turns upwards, crossing either over or under the Transversus perinaei muscle, and runs forwards, parallel to the pubic arch, in the interspace between the Accelerator urinse and Erector penis muscles, both of which it supplies, and is finally distributed to the skin and dartos of the scrotum. In its passage through the perineum, it lies beneath the superficial perineal fascia. The transverse perineal is a small branch which arises either from the internal pudic, or from the superficial perineal artery as it crosses the Transversus perinaei muscle. It runs transversely inwards along the cutaneous surface of the Transversus perin^i muscle, which it supplies, as well as the structures between the anus and bulb of the urethra, and anastomoses with the one of the opposite side. The artery of the bulb is a large but very short vessel, which arises from the internal pudic between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia, and, passing nearly transversely inwards, pierces the bulb of the urethra, in which it ramifies. It gives off a small branch which descends to supply Cowper's gland. Surgical Anatomy.—This artery is of considerable importance in a surgical point of view, as it is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy, an accident usually attended in the adult with alarming haemorrhage. The vessel is sometimes verv small, occasionally wanting, or even double. It sometimes arises from the internal pudic earlier than usual, and crosses the perinseum to reach the back part of the bulb. In such a case the vessel could hardly fail to be wounded in the performance of the lateral operation of lithotomy. If, on the contrary, it should arise from an accessory pudic, it lies more forward than usual, and is out of danger in the operation. The artery of the corpus cavernosum, one of the terminal branches of the internal pudic, arises from that vessel while it is situated between the crus penis and the ramus of the os pubis ; piercing the crus penis obliquely, it runs forwards in the centre of the corpus cavernosum, to which its branches are distributed. The dorsal artery of the penis ascends between the crus and pubic symphysis, and, piercing the suspensory ligament, runs forwards on the dorsum of the penis to the glans, where it divides into two branches, which supply the glans and pre- puce. On the dorsum of the penis, it lies immediately beneath the integument, parallel with the dorsal vein and the corresponding artery of the opposite side. It supplies the integument and fibrous sheath of the corpus cavernosum, sending branches through the sheath to anastomose with the preceding vessel. The Internal Pudic Artery in the Female is smaller than in the male. Its origin and course are similar, and there is considerable analogy in the distri- bution of its branches. The superficial artery supplies the labia pudendi; the artery of the bulb supplies the bulbi vestibuli and the erectile tissue of the vagina; the artery of the corpus cavernosum supplies the cavernous body of the clitoris; and the arteria dorsalis clitoridis supplies the dorsum of that organ, and terminates in the glans and in the membranous fold corresponding to the prepuce of the male. The Sciatic Artery (fig. 375), the larger of the two terminal branches of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, is distributed to the muscles at the back of the pelvis. It passes down to the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, behind the internal pudic artery, resting on the sacral plexus of nerves and Pyriformis muscle, and escapes from the pelvis through this foramen between the Pyriformis and Coccygeus. It then descends in the interval between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, accompanied by the sciatic nerves, and covered by the Gluteus maximus, and is continued down the back of the thigh supplying the skin, and anastomosing with branches of the perforating arteries. Within the pelvis, it distributes branches to the Pyriformis, Coccygeus, and Levator ani muscles ; some hsemorrhoidal branches, which supply the rectum, andARTERIES 6o8 occasionally take the place of the middle haemorrhoidal artery; branches to the base and neck of the bladder, vesicnlae seminales, gland. External to the pelvis, it gives off the following branches :— Coccygeal. Comes Nervi Ischiadici. Inferior Gluteal. Muscular. Articular. and vesical and prostate Fig. 375. -The arteries of the gluteal and posterior femoral re<]fions. The coccygeal branch runs inwards, pierces the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and supplies the Gluteus maximus, the integument, and other structures on the back of the coccyx. The inferior gluteal branches, three or four in number, supply the Gluteus maximus muscle, anasto- mosing with the gluteal artery in the substance of the muscle. The comes nervi ischi- adici is a long, slender vessel, which accompanies the great sciatic nerve for a short distance ; it then penetrates it, and runs in its substance to the lower part of the thigh. The muscular branches supply the muscles on the back part of the hip, ana- stomosing with the gluteal, external branch of the obturator, internal and ex- ternal circumflex, and su- perior perforating arteries. Some articular branches are distributed to the cap- sule of the hip-joint. The Ilio-lumbar Artery, given off from the posterior trunk of the internal iliac, turns upwards and outwards between the obturator nerve and lumbo-sacral cord, to the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, behind which it divides into a lumbar and an iliac branch. The lumbar branch supplies the Psoas and Quadratus lumborum muscles, anastomosing with the last lumbar artery, and sends a small spinal branch through the intervertebral foramen, between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, into the spinal canal, to supply the spinal cord and its membranes. The iliac branch descends to supply the Iliacus muscle ; some offsets, running between the muscle and the bone, anastomose with the iliac branch of the Termination of internal circurnfiex Superior 2^ erf or citing Middle 2)erfcrating l7iferior 'perforatbig Tei mination of profunda Supeiior miLSCular Superior inter articular external articular Inferior mnscu ko609 EXTEENAL ILIAC obturator; one of these enters an oblique canal to supply the diploe, whilst others run along the crest of the ilium, distributing branches to the Gluteal and Abdominal muscles, and anastomose in their course with the gluteal, circumflex iliac, and external circumflex arteries. The Lateral Sacral Arteries (fig. 372) are usually two in number on each side, superior and inferior. The superior, which is of large size, passes inwards, and, after anastomosing with branches from the middle sacral, enters the first or second sacral foramen, is distributed to the contents of the sacral canal in the same manner as the lateral spinal branches from the vertebral, and, escaping by the corresponding posterior sacral foramen, supplies the skin and muscles on the dorsum of the sacrum, anastomosing with the gluteal. The inferior passes obliquely across the front of the Pyriformis muscle and sacral nerves to the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina, descends on the front of the sacrum, and anastomoses over the coccyx with the sacra media and opposite lateral sacral arteries. In its course it gives off branches, which enter the anterior sacral foramina ; these, after giving off branches to be distributed to the contents of the sacral canal in the same manner as the lateral spinal branches from the vertebral, escape by the posterior sacral foramina, and are distributed to the muscles and skin on the dorsal surface of the sacrum, anastomosing with the gluteal. The Gluteal Artery is the largest branch of the internal iliac, and appears to be the continuation of the posterior division of that vessel. It is a short, thick trunk, which passes out of the pelvis above the upper border of the Pyriformis muscle, and immediately divides into a superficial and deep branch. Within the pelvis, it gives off a few muscular branches to the Iliacus, Pyriformis, and Obturator internus, and, just previous to quitting that cavity, a nutrient artery, which enters the ilium. The superficial branch passes beneath the Gluteus maximus, and divides into numerous branches, some of which supply that muscle, whilst others perforate its tendinous origin, and supply the integument covering the posterior surface of the sacrum, anastomosing with the posterior branches of the sacral arteries. The deep branch runs between the Gluteus medius and minimus, and sub- divides into two. Of these, the superior division, continuing the original course of the vessel, passes along the upper border of the Gluteus minimus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, anastomosing with the circumflex iliac and ascending branches of the external circumflex artery. The inferior division crosses the Gluteus minimus obliquely to the trochanter major, distributing branches to the Glutei muscles, and inosculates with the external circumflex artery. Some branches pierce the Gluteus minimus to supply the hip-joint. Surface Marking.—The position of the three main branches of the internal iliac, the sciatic, internal pudic, and gluteal, which may occasionally be the object of surgical inter- ference, is indicated on the surface in the following way : a line is to be drawn from the posterior superior iliac spine to the posterior superior angle of the great trochanter, with the limb slightly flexed and rotated inwards : the point of emergence of the gluteal artery from the upper part of the sciatic notch will correspond with the junction of the upper with the middle third of this line. A second line is to be drawn from the same point to the middle of the tuberosity of the ischium ; the junction of the lower with the middle third marks the point of emergence of the sciatic and pudic arteries from the great sciatic notch. Surgical Anatomy.—Any of these three vessels may require ligaturing for a wound or for aneurism, which is generally traumatic, and the operation may be performed by an incision, three or four inches long, in the direction of the fibres of the Gluteus maxhnus muscle, the middle of the cut corresponding to the point indicating their respective positions. External Iliac Artery (fig. 372) The external iliac artery is larger in the adult than the internal iliac, and passes obliquely downwards and outwards along the inner border of the Psoas muscle, from Pt RARTERIES 6io the bifurcation of the common iliac to Poupart's ligament, Avhere it enters the thigh and becomes the femoral artery. Relations.—In front, with the peritonemn, subperitoneal areolar tissue, the intestines, and a thin layer of fascia, derived from the iliac fascia, which surrounds the artery and vein. At its origin it is occasionally crossed by the ureter. The spermatic vessels descend for some distance upon it near its termination, and it is crossed in this situation by the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve and the circumflex iliac vein ; the vas deferens curves down along its inner side. Behind, it is in relation with the external iliac vein, which, at Poupart's ligament, lies at its inner side ; on the left side the vein is altogether internal to the artery. Externallii, it rests against the Psoas muscle, from which it is separated by the iliac fascia. The artery rests upon this muscle, near Poupart's ligament. Numerous lymphatic vessels and glands are found lying on the front and inner side of the vessel. Plan of the Relations of the External Iliac Aeteky In front. Peritoneum, intestines, and fascia.

Surface Marhing.—The surface line indicating the course of the external iliac artery has been already given (see page 600). Surgical Anatomy.—The application of a ligature to the external iliac may be required in cases of aneurism of the femoral artery, or for a wound of the artery. This vessel may be secured in any part of its course, excepting near its upper end, which is to be avoided on account of the proximity of the great stream of blood in the internal iliac, and near its lower end, which should also be avoided, on account of the proximity of the epigastric and circumflex iliac vessels. One of the chief pomts in the performance of the operation is to secure the vessel without injury to the peritoneum. The patient having been placed in the recumbent joosition, an incision should be made, commencing below at a point about three-quarters of an inch above Poupart's ligament, and a little external to its middle, and running upwards and outwards, parallel to Poupart's ligament, to a point above the anterior superior spine of the ilium. When the artery is deeply seated, more room will be required, and may be obtained by curving the incision from the point last named inwards towards the umbilicus for a short distance ; or, if the lower part of the artery is to be reached, the surgeon may adopt the plan advocated by Sir Astley Cooper, by making an incision close to Poupart's ligament from about half an inch outside the external abdominal ring to one inch internal to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. This incision, being made in the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, is less likely to be followed by a ventral hernia, but there is danger of wounding the epigastric artery. Abernethy, who first tied this artery, made his incision in the course of the vessel. The abdominal muscles and transversalis fascia having been cautiously divided, the peritonemn should be separated from the iliac fossa and raised towards the pelvis; and on introducing the finger to the bottom of the wound the artery may be felt pulsating along the inner border of the Psoas muscle. The external iliac vein is generally found on the inner side of the artery, and must be cautiously separated from it by the finger-nail, or handle of the knife, and the aneurism needle should be introduced on the inner side, between the artery and vein. Ligature of the external iliac artery has recently been performed in three or more cases by a transperitoneal method. An incision foin^ inches in length is made in the semilunar line, commencing about an inch below the umbilicus, and carried through the abdominal wall into the peritoneal cavity. The intestines are then pushed upwards and held out ofEXTERNAL ILIAC 6ii the way by a broad abdominal retractor, and an incision made tlirough the peritoneum at the margin of tlie pelvis in the course of the artery, and the vessel secured in any part of its course which may seem desirable to the operator. The advantages of this operation appear to be, that if it is found necessary the common iliac artery can be ligatured instead of the external iliac without extension or modification of the incision ; and secondly, that the vessel can be ligatured without in any way interfering with the coverings of the sac. Possibly a disadvantage may exist in the greater risk of hernia after this method. Collateral Circulation.—The principal anastomoses in carrying on the collateral circulation, after the application of a ligature to the external iliac, are— the ilio-lumbar with the circumflex iliac ; the gluteal with the external circumflex; the obturator with the internal circumflex ; the sciatic with the superior perforating and circumflex branches of the profunda artery ; and the internal pudic with the external pudic. When the obturator arises from the epigastric, it is supplied with blood by branches, either from the internal iliac, the lateral sacral, or the internal pudic. The epigastric receives its supply from the internal mammary and inferior intercostal arteries, and from the internal iliac by the anastomoses of its branches with the obturator. In the dissection of a limb, eighteen years after the successful ligature of the external iliac artery, by Sir A. Cooper, which is to be found in Guy's Hospital Reports, vol. i. p. 50, the anastomosing branches are described in three sets : An anterior set.— i. A very large branch from the ilio-lumbar artery to the circumflex iliac ; 2. another branch from the ilio-lumbar, joined by one from the obturator, and breaking up into numerous tortuous branches to anastomose with the external circumflex; 3. two other branches from the obturator, which passed over the brim of the pelvis, communicated with the epigastric, and then broke up into a plexus to anastomose with the internal circumflex. An internal set.—Branches given off from the obturator, after quitting the pelvis, which ramified among the adductor muscles on the inner side of the hip-joint, and joined most freely with branches of the internal circumflex. A jmsterior set.— i. Three large branches from the gluteal to the external circumflex; 2. several branches from the sciatic around the great sciatic notch to the internal and external circumflex, and the perforating branches of the profunda. Branches.—Besides several small branches to the Psoas muscle and the neigh- bom^ing lymphatic glands, the external iliac gives off two branches of considerable size, the Deep Epigastric and Deep Circmnflex Iliac. The Deep Epigastric Artery arises from the external iliac, a few lines above Poiipart's ligament. It at first descends to reach this ligament, and then ascends obliquely along the inner margin of the internal abdominal ring, lying between the transversalis fascia and peritoneum, and, continuing its course upwards, it pierces the transversalis fascia, and, passing over the semilunar fold of Douglas, enters the sheath of the Rectus muscle. It then ascends on the posterior surface of the muscle, and finally divides into numerous branches, which anastomose, above the umbilicus, with the terminal branches of the internal mammary and inferior intercostal arteries. The deep epigastric artery bears a very important relation to the internal abdominal ring as it passes obliquely upwards and inwards from its origin from the external iliac. In this part of its course it lies along the lower and inner margin of the ring, and beneath the commencement of the spermatic cord. As it winds round the internal abdominal ring, it is crossed by the vas deferens in the male and the round ligament in the female. Branches.—The branches of this vessel are the following : the cremasteric, which accompanies the spermatic cord, and supplies the Cremaster muscle and other coverings of the cord, anastomosing with the spermatic artery ; a imhic branch, which runs along Poupart's ligament, and then descends behind the pubes to the inner side of the femoral ring, and anastomoses with offsets from the obturator artery; muscular branches, some of which are distributed to the abdominal muscles and peritoneum, anastomosing with the lumbar and circumflex iliac arteries : others perforate the tendon of the External oblique, and supply the integument, anastomosing with branches of the superficial epigastric. Peculiar ities.—The origin of the epigastric may take place from any part of the external iliac between Poupart's ligament and two inches and a half above it; or it may arise below this ligament, from the femoral, or from the deep femoral. Union with Branches.—It frequently arises from the external iliac, by a common trunk with the obturator. Sometimes the epigastric arises from the obturator, the latter vessel E E 2AETERIES 6l2 being furnished by the internal ihac, or the epigastric may be formed of two branches, one derived from the external iliac, the other from the internal iliac. Surgical Anatomy.—The deep epigastric artery follows a line drawn from the middle of Poupart's ligament towards the mnbiliciis ; but shortly after this line crosses the linea semilunaris, the direction changes, and the course of the vessel is directly upwards in the line of junction of the inner third with the outer two thirds of the Rectus muscle. It has important surgical relations, in addition to the fact that it is one of the principal means, through its anastomosis with the internal mammary, in establishing the collateral circulation after ligature of either the common or external iliac arteries. It lies close to the internal abdominal ring, and is therefore internal to an oblique inguinal hernia, but external to a direct inguinal hernia, as it emerges from the abdomen. It forms the outer boundary of Hesselbach's triangle. It is in close relationship with the spermatic cord, which lies in front of it in the inguinal canal, separated only b}^ the transversalis fascia. The vas deferens hooks round its outer side. The Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery arises from the outer side of the external iliac nearly opposite the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely outwards behind Poupart's ligament, contained in a fibrous sheath formed by the junction of the transversalis and iliac fasciae, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. It then runs along the inner surface of the crest of the ilium to about its middle, where it pierces the Transversalis, and runs backwards between that muscle and the Internal oblique, to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar and gluteal arteries. Opposite the anterior superior spine of the ilium it gives off a large branch, which ascends between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles, supplying them, and anastomosing with the lumbar and epigastric arteries. ARTERIES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY Femoral Aeteey (fig. 376) The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac. It commences immediately behind Poupart's ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, and, passing down the fore part and inner side of the thigh, terminates at the opening in the Adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle wdth the lower third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery. The vessel, at the upper part of the thigh, lies a little internal to the head of the femur; in the lower part of its course, on the inner side of the shaft of the bone, and between these two parts, the vessel is far away from the bone. In the upper third of the thigh it is contained in a triangular space, called Scarpa's triangle. In the middle third of the thigh, it is contained in an aponeurotic canal, called Hunter's canal. Scarpa's Triangle.—Scarpa's triangle corresponds to the depression seen immediately below the fold of the groin. It is a triangular space, the apex of which is directed downwards, and the sides formed externally by the Sartorius, internally by the Adductor longus, and above by Poupart's ligament. The floor of the space is formed from without inwards by the Iliacus, Psoas, Pectineus, a small part of the Adductor brevis and the Adductor longus muscles; and it is divided into two nearly equal parts by the femoral vessels, which extend from the middle of its base to its apex : the artery giving off in this situation its cutaneous and profunda branches, the vein receiving the deep femoral and internal saphenous. On the outer side of the femoral artery is the anterior crural nerve dividing into its branches. Besides the vessels and nerves, this space contains some fat and lymphatics. Hunter's Canal.—This is the aponeurotic space in the middle third of the thigh, extending from the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the femoral opening in the Adductor magnus muscle. It is bounded, externally, by the Vastus internus ; internally, by the Adductor longus and magnus muscles ; and covered in by a strong aponeurosis which extends transversely from the Vastus internus, across the femoral vessels to the Adductor longus and magnus muscles ; lying on which aponeurosis is the Sartorius muscle. It contains the femoral artery and vein enclosed in their own sheath of areolar tissue, the vein being behind and on the outer side of the artery and the internal or long saphenous nerve lying on the outer side of the vessels.613 FEMOKAL vtum For convenience of description and also in reference to its surgical anatomy, the femoral atftery is divided into a short trunk, about an inch and a half or two inches long, which is known as the common femoral artery, and the remainder of the vessel, which is known as the sujjerficial femoral, to distinguish it from the deep femoral (profunda femoris), which is a large branch given off from the common femoral at its termination, and which by 376.—Surgical anatomy of the femoral artery, its derivation from the parent trunk marks the commencement of the superficial femoral artery. The common femoral artery is very superficial, being covered by the skin and superficial fascia, superficial inguinal lym- phatic glands, the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and the prolongation down- wards of the Transversalis fascia, which forms the sheath of the vessels. It has in front of it filaments from the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, the superficial circumflex iliac vein, and occasionally the superficial epigastric vein. It rests on the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, which separates it from the cap- sular ligament of the hip- joint, and a little lower on the Pectineus muscle ; and crossing behind it is the branch to the Pectineus from the anterior crural nerve. Separating the artery from the Psoas and Pectineus muscles is the pubic portion of the fascia lata and the prolongation from the fascia covering the Iliacus muscle which forms the posterior layer of the sheath of the vessels. The anterior crural nerve lies about half an inch to the outer side of the com- mon femoral artery, lying between the Psoas and Iliacus muscles. To the inner side of the artery is the femoral vein, between the margins of the Pectineus and Psoas muscles. The two vessels are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath, formed by the proper sheath of the vessels, strengthened by the fascia lata (see page 486) ; the artery and vein are separated, however, from one another by a thm fibrous partition.

In Hunter's canal it is more deeply seated, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fascia, the Sartorius and aponeurotic covering of Hunter's canal. The internal saphenous nerve crosses the artery from without inwards. Behind, the artery lies at its upper part on the femoral vein and the profunda artery and vein, which separate it from the Pectineus muscle, and lower down on the Adductor longus and Adductor magnus muscles. To the outer side is the long saphenous nerve and the nerve to the Vastus internus; the Vastus internus muscle and, at its lower part, the femoral vein.

The internal cutaneous nerve passes obliquely across the upper part of the sheath of the femoral artery. Peculiarities.—Double femoral reunited.—Several cases are recorded in which the femoral artery divided into two trunks below the origin of the profunda, and became reunited near the opening in the Adductor magnus, so as to form a single popliteal artery. One of them occurred in a patient operated upon for popliteal aneurism. Change of Position.—A few cases have been recorded in which the femoral artery was situated at the back of the thigh, the vessel being continuous above with the internal iliac, escaping from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and accompanying the great sciatic nerve to the popliteal space, where its division occurred in the usual manner. The external iliac in these cases was small, and terminated in the profunda. Position of the Vein.—The femoral vein is occasionally placed along the inner side of the artery, throughout the entire extent of Scarpa's triangle; or it may be slit so that a large vein is placed on each side of the artery for a greater or less extent. Origin of the Profimda.—This vessel occasionally arises from the inner side, and, more rarely, from the back of the common trunk; but the more important peculiarity, in a sm^gical point of view, is that which relates to the height at which the vessel arises from the femoral. In three-fourths of a large number of cases, it arose between one or two inches below Poupart's ligament; in a few cases the distance was less than an inch ; more rarely, opposite the ligament; and in one case, above Poupart's ligament, from the external iliac. Occasionally, the distance between the origin of the vessel and Poupart's ligament exceeds two inches, and in one case it was found to be as much as four inches. Surface Marhing.—The upper two-thirds of a line drawn from a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis to the prominent laber- osity on the inner condyle of the femur, with the' thigh abducted and rotated outwards, will indicate the course of the femoral artery. Surgical Anatomy.—Compression of the femoral artery, which is constantly requisite in amputations and other operations on the lower limb, and also for the cure of popliteal aneurisms, is most effectually made immediately below Poupart's ligament. In this situation the artery is very superficial, and is merely separated from the horizontal ramus of the OS pubis by the Psoas muscle ; so that the surgeon, by means of his thumb or a compressor, may effectually control the circidation through it. This vessel may also be compressed in the middle third of the thigh by placing a compress over the artery, beneath the tourniquet, and directing the pressure from within outwards, so as to compress the vessel against the inner side of the shaft of the femur. The ajJjylication of a ligature to the femoral artery may be required in the cases of wound or aneurism of the arteries of the leg, of the popliteal or femoral; * and the vessel may be exposed and tied in any part of its course. The great depth of this vessel at its lower part, its close connection with important structures, and the density of its sheath, render the operation in this situation one of much greater difficulty than the application of a ligature at its upper part, where it is more superficial. Ligature of the common femoral artery is usually considered unsafe, on account of the connection of large branches with it: viz. the deep epigastric and the deep circumflex iliac arising just above Poupart's ligament; on account of the number of small branches which arise from it, in its short course, and on account of the uncertainty of the origin of the profunda femoris, which, if it arise high up, would be too close to the ligature for the formation of a firm coagulum. The profunda sometimes arises higher than the point above mentioned, and rarely between two or three inches (in one case four) below Poupart's ligament. It would appear, then, that the most favourable situation for the apj)lication of a ligature to the femoral is between four and five inches from its point of origin. In order to expose the artery in this situation, an incision, between two and three inches long, should be made in the course of the vessel, the patient lying in the recumbent position, with the limb slightly fiexed and abducted. A large vein is frequently met with, passing in the course of the artery to join the saphena ; this must be avoided, and the fascia lata having been cautiously divided, and the Sartorius exposed, that muscle must be drawn outwards, in order to fully expose the sheath of the vessels. The finger being introduced into the wound, and the pulsation of the artery felt, the sheath should be opened on the outer side of the vessel to a sufficient extent to allow of the introduction of the ligature, but no further ; otherwise the nutrition of the coats of the vessel may be interfered with, or muscular branches which arise from the vessel at irregular intervals may be divided. In this part of the operation the long saphenous nerve and the nerve to the Vastus internus, which is in close relation with the sheath, should be avoided. The * Ligature of the femoral artery has been also recommended and performed for elephantiasis of the leg and acute inllammation of the knee-joint.—Maunder, Clin. Soc. Trans., vol. ii. p. 37.AKTEEIES 6i6 aneurism needle must be carefully introduced and kept close to the artery, to avoid the femoral vein, which lies behind the vessel in this part of its course. To expose the artery, in Hunter's canal, an incision should be made through the integument, betw^een three and four inches in length, a finger's breadth internal to the line of the artery, in the middle of the thigh—i.e. midway between the groin and the knee. The fascia lata having been divided, and the Sartorius muscle exposed, it should be drawn inwards, when the strong fascia which is stretched across fi'om the Adductors to the Vastus internus will be exposed, and must be fi-eely divided ; the sheath of the vessels is now seen, and must be opened, and the artery secured by passing the aneurism needle between the vein and artery, in the direction from without inwards. The femoral vein in this situation lies on the outer side of the artery, the long sa.phenous nerve on its anterior and outer side. It has been seen that the femoral artery occasionally divides into two trunks below the origin of the profunda. If, in the operation for tying the femoral, two vessels are met with, the surgeon should alternately compress each, in order to ascertain which vessel is connected with the aneurismal tumour, or with the bleeding from the wound, and that one only should be tied which controls the pulsation or haemorrhage. If, however, it is necessary to compress both vessels before the circulation in the tumour is controlled, both should be tied, as it would be probable that they became reunited, as in the instances referred to above. In wounds of the femoral artery the question of the mode of treatment is of considerable importance. If the wound in the superficial structures is a large one, the injured vessel must be exposed and tied; but if the wound is a punctured one and the bleeding has ceased, the question will arise whether to cut down upon the artery or to trust to pressure. Mr. Cripps * advises, that if the wound is in the ' upper part of the thigh—that is to say, in a position where the femoral artery is comparatively superficial—the surgeon may enlarge the opening with a good prospect of finding the wounded vessel without an extensive or prolonged operation. If the wound be in the lower half of the thigh, owing to the greater depth of the artery, and the possibility of its being the popliteal that is wounded, the search is rendered a far more severe and hazardous operation, and it should not be undertaken until a thorough trial of pressure has proved ineffectual.' Great care and attention are necessary for the successful application of pressure. The limb should be carefully bandaged from the foot upwards to the wound, which is not covered, and then onwards to the groin. The wound is then dusted with iodoform or boracic powder, and a conical pad applied over the wound. Eollers the thickness of the index finger are then placed along the course of the vessel above and below the wound, and the whole carefully bandaged to a back splint with a foot-piece. Collateral Circulation.—AVhen the common femoral is tied, the main channels for carrying on the circulation are the anastomoses of the gluteal and circumflex iliac arteries above with the external circumflex below ; of the obtm^ator and sciatic above with the internal circumflex below ; and of the comes nervi ischiadici with the arteries in the ham. The principal agents in carrying on the collateral circulation after ligature of the super- ficial femoral artery are, according to Sir A. Cooper, as follows :— ' The arteria profunda formed the new channel for the blood.' ' The first artery sent off passed down close to the back of the thigh-bone, and entered the two superior articular branches of the popliteal artery.' ' The second new large vessel, arising from the profunda at the same part with the former, passed down by the inner side of the Biceps muscle, to a branch of the popliteal which was distributed to the Gastrocnemius muscle ; whilst a third artery, dividing into several branches, passed down with the sciatic nerve behind the knee-joint, and some of its branches united themselves with the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, with some recurrent branches of those arteries, with arteries passing to the Gastrocnemii, and, lastly, with the origin of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.' ' It appears then that it is those branches of the profunda which accompany the sciatic nerve that are the principal supporters of the new circulation.' t In Porta's work \ (tab. xii. xiii.) is a good representation of the collateral circulation after the ligature of the femoral artery. The patient had survived the operation three years. The lower part of the artery is at least as large as the upper; about two inches of the vessel appear to have been obliterated. The external and internal circumflex arteries are seen anastomosing by a great number of branches with the lower branches of the femoral (muscular and anastomotica magna), and with the articular branches of the popliteal. The branches from the external circumflex are extremely large and numerous. One very distinct anastomosis can be traced between this artery on the outside and the anastomotica magna on the inside, through the intervention of the superior external articular artery, with which they both anastomose; and blood reaches even the anterior tibial recurrent from the external circumflex by means of anastomosis with the same external articular artery. The perforating branches of the profunda are also seen bringing blood round the obliterated portion of the artery into long branches (muscular) which * Heath's Dictionary of Practical Surgery, vol. i. p. 525. '\ Med.-Chir. Trans., vol. ii. 1811. t Alteraziom patologiclie delle Arterie.617 FEMOEAL have been given off just below that portion. The termination of the profunda itself anastomoses most freely with the superior external articular. A long branch of anasto- mosis is also traced down from the internal iliac by means of the comes nervi ischiadici of the sciatic which anastomoses on the popliteal nerves with branches from the popliteal and posterior tibial arteries. In this case the anastomosis had been too free, since the pulsation and growth of the aneurism recurred, and the patient died after ligature of the external iliac. There is an interesting preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons, of a limb on which John Hunter had tied the femoral artery fifty years before the patient's death. The whole of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery seems to have been obliterated. The anastomosis by means of the comes nervi ischiadici, which is shown in Porta's plate, is distinctly seen: the external circumflex, and the termination of the profunda artery, seem to have been the chief channels of anastomosis ; but the injection has not been a very successful one. Branches.—The branches of the femoral artery are, the Superficial Epigastric. [External Circumflex. Superficial Circumflex Iliac. Profmida J Internal Circumflex. Superficial External Pudic. (Three Perforating. Deep External Pudic. . Muscular. Anastomotica Magna. The superficial epigastric arises from the femoral, about half an inch below Poupart's ligament, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, ascends on to the abdomen, in the superficial fascia covering the External oblique muscle, nearly as high as the umbilicus. It distributes branches to the superficial inguinal glands, the superficial fascia, and the integument, anastomosing with branches of the deep epigastric. The superficial circumfiex iliac, the smallest of the cutaneous branches, arises close to the preceding, and, piercing the fascia lata, runs outwards, parallel with Poupart's ligament, as far as the crest of the ilium, dividing into branches which supply the integument of the groin, the superficial fascia, and the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, anastomosing with the circumflex iliac, and with the gluteal and external circumflex arteries. The superficial external pudic (superior) arises from the inner side of the femoral artery, close to the preceding vessels, and, after passing through the saphenous opening, courses inwards, across the spermatic cord or round ligament to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudic. The deep external pudic (inferior), more deeply seated than the preceding, passes inwards on the Pectineus muscle, covered by the fascia lata, which it pierces at the inner border of the thigh, its branches being distributed, in the male, to the integument of the scrotum and perinasum ; and in the female to the labium, anastomosing with branches of the superficial perineal artery. The Profunda Femoris [deej) femoral artery) nearly equals the size of the superficial femoral. It arises from the outer and back part of the femoral artery, from one to two inches below Poupart's ligament. It at first lies on the outer side of the superficial femoral, and then passes behind it and the femoral vein to the inner side of the femur, and, passing downwards beneath the Adductor longus, termmates at the lower third of the thigh in a small branch, which pierces the Adductor magnus (and from this circumstance is sometimes called the fourth perforating artery), and is distributed to the flexor muscles on the back of the thigh, anastomosing with branches of the popliteal and inferior perforating arteries. Relations.—Behind, it lies first upon the Iliacus, and then on the Pectineus, Adductor brevis, and Adductor magnus muscles. In front, it is separated from the femoral artery, above by the femoral and profunda veins, and below by the Adductor longus. On its outer side, the origin of the Vastus internus separates it from the femur.6i8 ARTEEIES Plan of the Relations of the Profunda Arteey In front. Femoral and Profunda veins. Adductor lonf^ns. Outer side. Vastus internus. Beliind. Iliacus. Pectineus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. The External Circumflex Artery supplies the muscles on the front of the thigh. It arises from the outer side of the profunda, passes horizontally out- wards, between the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and behind the Sartorius and Rectus muscles, and divides into three sets of branches, ascending, transverse, and descending. The ascending branches pass upwards, beneath the Tensor vaginae femoris muscle, to the outer side of the hip, anastomosing with the terminal branches of the gluteal and circumflex iliac arteries. The descending branches, three or four in number, pass downwards, behind the Rectus, upon the Vasti muscles to which they are distributed, one or two passing beneath the Vastus externus as far as the knee, anastomosing with the superior articular branches of the popliteal artery. These are accompanied by the branch of the anterior crural nerve to the Vastus externus. The transverse branches, the smallest and least numerous, pass outwards over the Crureus, pierce the Vastus externus, and wind round the femur to its back part, just below the great trochanter, anastomosing at the back of the thigh with the internal circumflex, sciatic, and superior perforating arteries. The Internal Circumflex Artery, smaller than the external, arises from the inner and back part of the profunda, and winds round the inner side of the femur, between the Pectineus and Psoas muscles. On reaching the upper border of the Adductor brevis, it gives off two branches, one of which passes inwards to be distributed to the Adductor muscles, the Gracilis, and Obturator externus, anasto- mosing with the obturator artery; the other descends, and passes beneath the Adductor brevis, to supply it and the great Adductor ; while the continuation of the vessel passes backwards, between the Quadratus femoris and upper border of the Adductor magnus, anastomosing with the sciatic, external circumflex, and superior perforating arteries (' the crucial anastomosis '). Opposite the hip-joint, this branch gives off an articular vessel, which enters the joint beneath the trans- verse ligament; and, after supplying the adipose tissue, passes along the round ligament to the head of the bone. The Perforating Arteries (fig. 375), usually three in number, are so called from their perforating the tendon of the Adductor magnus muscle to reach the back of the thigh. The first is given off above the Adductor brevis, the second in front of that muscle, and the third immediately below it. The first or superior perforating artery passes backwards between the Pectineus and Adductor brevis (sometimes perforates the latter); it then pierces the Adductor magnus close to the linea aspera, and divides into branches which supply the Adductor brevis, the Adductor magnus, the Biceps, and Gluteus maximus muscle ; anastomosing with the sciatic, internal and external circumflex, and middle per- forating arteries.POPLITEAL 619 The second or middle perforating artery, larger than the first, pierces the tendons of the Adductor brevis and Adductor magnus muscles ; and divides into ascending and descending branches, which supply the flexor muscles of the thigh, anastomosing with the superior and inferior perforating. The nutrient artery of the femur is usually given off from this branch. The third or inferior perforating artery is given off below the Adductor brevis ; it pierces the Adductor magnus, and divides into branches which supply the flexor muscles of the thigh ; anastomosing above with the perforating arteries, and below with the terminal branches of the profunda and the muscular branches of the popliteal. Muscular branches are given off from the superficial femoral throughout its entire course. They vary from two to seven in number, and supply chiefly the Sartorius and Vastus internus. The Anastomotica Magna arises from the femoral artery just before it passes through the tendinous opening in the Adductor magnus muscle, and divides into a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch accompanies the long saphenous nerve, beneath the Sartorius, and, piercing the fascia lata, is distributed to the integument. The deep branch descends in the substance of the Vastus internus, lying in front of the tendon of the Adductor magnus, to the inner side of the knee, where it anastomoses with the superior internal articular artery and anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. A branch from this vessel crosses outwards above the articular surface of the femur, forming an anastomotic arch with the superior external articular artery, and supplies branches to the knee-joint. Popliteal Artery The popliteal artery commences at the termination of the femoral at the opening in the Adductor magnus, and, passing obliquely downwards and outwards behind the knee-joint to the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, divides into the anterior and ijosterior tibial arteries. A portion of the artery lies in the popliteal space; but above, to a slight extent, and below, to a considerable extent, it is covered by the muscles which form the boundaries of the space, and is therefore beyond the confines of the hollow. The Popliteal Space (fig. 377) Dissection.—A vertical incision about eight inches in length should be made along the back part of the knee-joint, connected above and below by a transverse incision from the inner to the outer side of the limb. The flaps of integmnent included between these incisions should be reflected in the direction shown in fig. 328, page 493. Boundaries.—The popliteal space, or the ham, is a lozenge-shaped space, widest at the back part of the knee-joint, and deepest above the articular end of the femur. It is bounded externally, above the joint, by the Biceps, and, below the joint, by the Plantaris and external head of the Gastrocnemius. Internally, above the joint, by the Semimembranosus, Semitendinosus, Gracilis, and Sartorius; below the joint, by the inner head of the Gastrocnemius. Above, it is limited by the apposition of the inner and outer hamstring muscles; below, by the junction of the two heads of the Gastrocnemius. The floor is formed by the lower part of the posterior surface of the shaft of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, the upper end of the tibia, and the fascia covering the Popliteus muscle, and the space is covered in by the fascia lata. Contents.-—It contains the popliteal vessels and their branches, together with the termination of the external saphenous vein, the internal and external popliteal nerves and some of their branches, the lower extremity of the small sciatic nerve, the articular branch from the obturator nerve, a few small lymphatic glands, and a considerable quantity of loose adipose tissue.ARTERIES 620 Position of contained parts.—The internal popliteal nerve descends in the middle line of the space, lying superficial and crossing the artery from without inwards. The external popliteal nerve descends on the outer side of the space, lying close to the tendon of the Biceps muscle. More deeply at the bottom of the space are the popliteal vessels, the vein lying superficial and a little external to the artery, to which it is closely united by dense areolar tissue; sometimes the vein is placed on the inner instead of the outer side of the artery; or the vein may be double, the artery lying between the two venae comites, which are usually connected by short transverse branches. More deeply, and, at its upper part, close to the surface of the bone, is the popliteal artery, and passing oft' from it at right angles are its articular branches. The articular branch from the obturator nerve descends upon the popliteal artery to supply the knee ; and occasionally there is found deep in the space an articular filament from the great sciatic nerve. The popliteal lymphatic glands, four or five in number, are found surrounding the artery : one usually lies superficial to the vessel; another is situated between it and the bone ; and the rest are placed on either side of it. The Popliteal Artery, in its course downwards from the aperture in the Adductor magnus to the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, rests first on the inner surface of the femur, and is then separated by a little fat from the hollowed popliteal surface of the bone; in the middle of its course, it rests on the posterior ligament of the knee-joint ; and below, on the fascia covering the Popliteus muscle. Super- ficially, it is covered above by the Semimembranosus ; in the middle of its course, by a quantity of fat, which separates it from the deep fascia and integument; and below, it is overlapped by the Gastrocnemius, Plantaris, and Soleus muscles, the popliteal vein, and the internal popliteal nerve. The popliteal vein, which is intimately attached to the artery, lies superficial and external to it, until near the termination of the artery, when the vein crosses it and lies to its inner side. The popliteal nerve is still more superficial and external above, but below the joint it crosses the artery and lies on its inner side. Laterally, the artery is bounded by the muscles which are situated on either side of the popHteal space. Plan of Relations of Popliteal Aeteey I71 front. Femur. Ligamentum posticum. Popliteus.

Peculiarities in x^oint of Division.—Occasionally the popliteal artery divides pre- maturely into its terminal branches ; this uiiusual division occurs most frequently opposite the knee-joint. Unusual Branches.—The artery sometimes divides into the anterior tibial and peroneal, the_posterior tibial being wanting, or very small. Occasionally the popliteal is found to divide into three branches, the anterior and posterior tibial, and peroneal. _ Surface Marhing.—The course of the upper part of the popliteal artery is indicated by a line drawn from the outer border of the Semimembranosus muscle at the junction of the621 POPLITEAL middle and lower third of the thigh obliquely downwards to the middle of the popliteal space, exactly behind the knee-joint. From this point it passes vertically downwards to the level of a line drawn through the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia. Surgical Anatomy.—The popliteal artery is not infrequently the seat of injury. It may be torn by direct violence, as by the passage of a cart-wheel over the knee, or by hyper-extension of the knee ; and in the dead body, at all events, the middle and internal coats may be ruptured by extreme flexion. It may also be lacerated by fracture of the lower part of the shaft of the femur, or by antero-posterior dislocation of the knee-joint. It has been torn in breaking down adhesions in cases of fibrous ankylosis of the knee, and is in danger of being wounded, and in fact has been wounded, in performing Macewen's operation of osteotomy of the lower end of the femur for genu valgum. In addition, Spencer records a case m which the popliteal artery was wounded from in front by a stab just below the knee, the knife passing through the interosseous space. The popliteal artery is more frequently the seat of aneurism than is any other artery in the body, with the exception of the thoracic aorta. This is due no doubt in a great measure to the amount of movement to which it is subjected, and to the fact that it is supported by loose and lax tissue only, and not by muscles as is the case with most arteries. Ligature of the popliteal artery is required in cases of wound of that vessel, but for aneurism of the posterior tibial it is preferable to tie the superficial femoral. The popliteal may be tied in the upper or lower part of its course ; but in the middle of the ham the operation is attended with considerable difficulty, from the great depth of the artery, and from the extreme degree of tension of the lateral boundaries of the space. In order to expose the vessel in the upper part of its course, the patient should be placed in the prone position, with the limb extended. An incision about three inches in length should then be made through the integument, along the posterior margin of the Semimembranosus, and the fascia lata having been divided, this muscle must be drawn inwards. The internal popliteal nerve will be first exposed, lying very superficial and external to the artery; beneath this will be seen the popliteal vein, and still deeper, and to its inner side, the artery. The vein and nerve must be cautiously separated from the artery, and the aneurism needle passed around the vessel from without inw^ards. To expose the vessel in the lower part of its course, where the artery lies between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius, the patient should be placed in the same position as in the preceding operation. An incision should then be made through the integument in the middle line, commencing opposite the bend of the knee-joint, care being taken to avoid the external saphenous vein and nerve. After dividing the deep fascia, and separating some dense cellular membrane, the artery, vein, and nerve will be exposed, descending between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius. Some muscular branches of the popliteal should be avoided if possible, or, if divided, tied immediately. The leg being now flexed, in order the more effectually to 'separate the two heads of the Gastrocnemius, the nerve should be drawn inwards and the vein outwards, and the aneurism needle passed between the artery and vein from without inwards. In cases where the artery has been wounded during an osteotomy of the lower end of the femur, it would be most conveniently secured from the front at the inner side of the thigh. The knee is flexed and the limb placed on its outer side. An incision, three inches long, is made parallel to and immediately behind the tendon of the Adductor magnus from the junction of the middle and lower third of the thigh. Skin, superficial and deep fascia are to be divided, care being taken of the internal saphenous vein; the Adductor magnus is to be drawn forwards, and the inner hamstring tendons backwards, and the artery will be found surrounded by fat. The nerve and vein are usually not seen, as they lie to the outer side of the artery. The branches of the popliteal artery are, the Muscular I ^^^P^^'^^^'- Superior Internal Articular. (Inferior or Sural. Azygos Articular. Cutaneous. Inferior External Articular. Superior External Articular. Inferior Internal Articular. The superior muscular "branches, two or three in number, arise from the upper part of the popliteal artery, and are distributed to the Vastus externus and flexor muscles of the thigh ; anastomosing Avith the inferior perforating, and terminal branches of the profunda. The inferior muscular (sural) are two large branches, which are distributed to the two heads of the Gastrocnemius and to the Plantaris muscle. They arise from the popliteal artery opposite the knee-joint. Cutaneous branches descend on each side and in the middle of the limb, between the Gastrocnemius and integument; they arise separately from the popliteal artery, or from some of its branches, and supply the integument of the calf.622 ARTEEIES The superior articular arteries, two in number, arise one on each side of the popliteal, and wind round the femur immediately above its condyles to the front Fig. ^77.—The pophteal, posterior tibial, Fig. 378—Surgical anatomy of the anterior and peroneal arteries tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Inferior external articular Ml, —Sural arteries Inferior internal articiilarANTERIOR TIBIAL *4 of the knee-joint. The internal branch passes beneath the tendon of the Adductor magnus, and divides into two, one of which suppHes the Vastus internus, inoscu- lating with the anastomotica magna and inferior internal articular; the other ramifies close to the surface of the femur, supplying it and the knee-joint, and anastomosing with the superior external articular artery. The external branch passes above the outer condyle, beneath the tendon of the Biceps, and divides into a superficial and deep branch : the superficial branch supplies the Vastus externus, and anastomoses with the descending branch of the external circumflex, and the inferior external articular arteries ; the deep branch supplies the lower part of the femur and knee-joint, and forms an anastomotic arch across the bone with the anastomotica magna and the inferior internal articular arteries. The azygos articular is a small branch, arising from the popliteal artery oppo- site the bend of the knee-joint. It pierces the posterior ligament, and supplies the ligaments and synovial membrane in the interior of the articulation. The inferior articular arteries, two in number, arise from the popUteal beneath the Gastrocnemius, and wind round the head of the tibia, below the joint. The internal one passes below the inner tuberosity, beneath the internal lateral ligament, at the anterior border of which it ascends to the front and inner side of the joint, to supply the head of the tibia and the articulation of the knee, anasto- mosing with the inferior external articular and superior internal articular arteries. The external one passes outwards above the head of the fibula, to the front of the knee-joint, passing in its course beneath the outer head of the Gastrocnemius, the external lateral ligament, and the tendon of the Biceps muscle, and divides into branches, which anastomose with the inferior internal articular artery, the superior external articular artery, and the anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. Circumpatellar Anastomosis.—Around and above the patella, and on the contiguous ends of the femur &r\d tibia, is a large network of vessels, forming a superficial and deep plexus from which numerous offsets proceed into the interior of the joint. The arteries from which this plexus is formed are the two internal and two external articular branches of the popliteal; the anastomotica magna ; the terminal branch of the profunda ; the descending branch from the external circumflex and the anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. The anterior tibial artery commences at the bifurcation of the popliteal, at the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, passes forwards between the two heads of the Tibialis posticus, and through the large oval aperture above the upper border of the interosseous membrane, to the deep part of the front of the leg: it then descends on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, gradually approaching the tibia ; and, at the lower part of the leg, lies on this bone, and then on the anterior ligament of the ankle, to the bend of the ankle-joint, where it lies more superficially, and becomes the dorsalis pedis. Eolations.—In the upper two-thirds of its extent, it rests upon the interosseous membrane, to which it is connected by delicate fibrous arches thrown across it. In the lower third, upon the front of the tibia, and the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint. In the upper third of its course, it lies between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum ; in the middle third, between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor proprius hallucis. At the bend of the ankle, it is crossed by .the tendon of the Extensor proprius hallucis, and lies between it and the innermost tendon of the Extensor longus digitorum. It is covered, in the upper two- thirds of its course, by the muscles which lie on either side of it, and by the deep fascia ; in« the lower third, by the integument, anterior annular ligament, and fascia. The anterior tibial artery is accompanied by two veins (venae comites), which lie one on each side of the artery; the anterior tibial nerve lies at first to its outer Antekior Tibial Aeteey (fig. 378)ARTERIES 624 side, and about the middle of the leg is placed suiDerficial to it; at the lower part of the artery the nerve is generally again on the outer side.

Pecnliarities in Size.—This vessel may be diminished in size, may be deficient to a greater or less extent, or may be entirely wanting, its place being supplied by perforating branches from the posterior tibial^ or by the anterior division of the peroneal artery. Course.—The artery occasionally deviates in its course towards the fibular side of the leg, regaining its usual position beneath the annular ligament at the front of the ankle. In two instances the vessel has been foimd to approach the surface in the middle of the leg, being covered merely by the integument and fascia below that point. Surface Marhing.—A line drawn from the inner side of the head of the fibula to midway between the two malleoli, will mark the course of the artery ; the point where the artery comes in front of the interosseous membrane being in this line, one and a quarter inch below the level of the head of the fibula. Surgical Anatomy.—The anterior tibial artery may be tied in the upper or lower part of the leg. In the upper part the operation is attended with great difficulty, on account of the depth of the vessel from the surface. An incision, about four inches in length, should be made through the integmnent, midway between the spine of the tibia and the outer margin of the fibula, the fascia and intermuscular septum between the Tibialis anticus and Extensor longus digitorum being divided to the same extent. The foot must be flexed to relax these muscles, and they must be separated from each other by the finger. The artery is then exposed, deeply seated, lying upon the interosseous membrane, the nerve lying externally, and one of the venae comites on either side ; these must be separated from the artery before the aneurism needle is passed round it. To tie the vessel in the lower third of the leg above the ankle-joint, an incision about three inches in length should be made through the integument between the tendons of the Tibialis anticus and Extensor proprius hailucis muscles, the deep fascia being divided to the same extent. The tendon on either side should be held aside, when the vessel will be seen lying upon the tibia, with the nerve superficial to it, and one of the venae comites on either side. The branches of the anterior tibial artery are, the Posterior Recurrent Tibial. Muscular. Superior Fibular. Internal Malleolar. Anterior Recurrent Tibial External Malleolar. The posterior recurrent tibial is not a constant branch, and is given oft' from the anterior tibial before that vessel passes through the interosseous space. It ascends beneath the Popliteus muscle, which it supplies, and anastomoses with the lower articular branches of the popliteal artery, giving off an offset to the superior tibio-fibular joint. The superior fibular is sometimes given off from the anterior tibial, sometimes from the posterior tibial. It passes outwards, round the neck of the fibula, through the Soleus, which it sup^Dlies, and ends in the substance of the Peroneus longus muscle.DORSALIS PEDIS 625 The anterior recurrent tibial branch arises from the anterior tibial, as soon as that vessel has passed through the interosseous s^Dace ; it ascends in the Tibialis anticus muscle, and ramifies on the front and sides of the knee-joint, anastomosing with the articular branches of the popliteal, and with the anasto- motica magna. The muscular branches are numerous : they are distributed to the muscles which lie on each side of the vessel, some piercing the deep fascia to supply the integument, others passing through the interosseous membrane, and anastomosing with branches of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. The malleolar arteries supply the ankle-joint. The internal arises about two inches above the articulation, and passes beneath the tendons of the Extensor proprius hallucis and Tibiahs anticus to the inner ankle, upon which it ramifies, anastomosing with branches of the posterior tibial and internal plantar arti virs and with the internal calcanean from the posterior tibial. The external passes beneath the tendons of the Extensor longus digitorum and Peroneus tertius, and supplies the outer ankle, anastomosing with the anterior peroneal artery, and with a'=cending branches from the tarsal branch of the dor sails pedis. DoESALis Pedis Aeteey (fig. 378) The dorsalis pedis, the continuation of the anterior tibial, passes forwards from the bend of the ankle along the tibial side of the foot to the back part of the first intermetatarsal space, where it divides into two branches, the dorsalis Jiallucis and covimiinicatijig. Relations.—This vessel, in its course forwards, rests upon the astragalus, navicular, and internal cmieiform bones and the hgaments connecting them, being covered by the integument and fascia, anterior annular ligament, and crossed near its termination by the innermost tendon of the Extensor brevis digitorum. On its tibi'al side is the tendon of the Extensor proprius hallucis; on its fibular side, the innermost tendon of the Extensor longus digitorum, and the termination of the anterior tibial nerve. It is accompanied by two veins. Plan of the Relations of the Doesalis Pedis Aeteey 1)2 front. Integument and fascia. Anterior annular ligament.

Peculiarities in Size.—The dorsal artery' of the foot may be larger than usual, to compensate for a deficient plantar artery ; or it may be deficient in its terminal branches to the toes, which are then derived fi'om the internal plantar; or its place may be supplied altogether by a large anterior peroneal artery. Position.—This artery frequently curves outwards, lying external to the line between the middle of the ankle and the back part of the first interosseous space. Surface MarJcing.—The dorsalis pedis artery is indicated on the surface of the dorsum of the foot by a line drawn from the centre of the space between the two malleoli to the back of the first intermetatarsal space. Surgiccd Anatomij.—This artery may be tied, by making an incision through the integument, between two and three inches in length, on the fibular side of the tendon of S S Tibial side. Extensor proprius hallucis.ARTERIES 626 the Extensor proprins liallucis, in the interval between it and tlie inner border of the short Extensor muscle. The incision should not extend further forwards than the back part of the first intermetatarsal space, as the artery divides in that situation. The deep fascia being divided to the same extent, the artery will be exposed, the nerve Ij'ingupon its outer side. Branches.—The branches of the dorsalis pedis are, the The tarsal artery arises from the dorsalis pedis, as that vessel crosses the navicular bone; it passes in an arched direction outwards, lying upon the tarsal bones, and covered by the Extensor brevis digitorum ; it supplies that muscle and the articulations of the tarsus, and anastomoses with branches from the metatarsal, external malleolar, peroneal, and external plantar arteries. The metatarsal arises a little anterior to the preceding ; it passes outwards to the outer part of the foot, over the bases of the metatarsal bones, beneath the tendons of the short Extensor, its direction being influenced by its point of origin ; and it anastomoses wdth the tarsal and external plantar arteries. This vessel gives off three branches, the interosseous arteries, w^hich pass forwards upon the three outer Dorsal interossei muscles, and, in the clefts between the toes, divide into two dorsal collateral branches for the adjoining toes. At the back part of each interosseous space these vessels receive the posterior perforating branches from the plantar arch ; and at the fore part of each interosseous space, they are joined by the anterior perforating branches, from the digital arteries. The outer- most interosseous artery gives off a branch which supplies the outer side of the little toe. The dorsalis hallucis runs forwards along the outer border of the first meta- tarsal bone, and at the cleft between the first and second toes divides into tw^o branches, one of which passes inwards, beneath the tendon of the Extensor proprius hallucis, and is distributed to the inner border of the great toe ; the outer branch bifurcates, to supply the adjoining sides of the great and second toes. The communicating artery dips down into the sole of the foot, between the two heads of the First dorsal interosseous muscle, and inosculates wdth the termina- tion of the external plantar artery, to complete the plantar arch. It here gives off two digital branches : one runs along the inner side of the great toe, on its plantar surface ; the other passes forwards along the first interosseous space, and bifurcates for the supply of the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The posterior tibial is an artery of large size, which extends obliquely down- w^ards from the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, along the tibial side of the leg, to the fossa between the inner ankle and the heel, where it divides beneath the origin of the Abductor hallucis, on a level with a line drawn from the point of the internal malleolus to the centre of the convexity of the heel, into the internal and external plantar arteries. At its origin it lies opposite the interval between the tibia and fibula ; as it descends, it approaches the inner side of the leg, lying behind the tibia, and, in the lower part of its course, is situated midway between the inner malleolus and the tuberosity of the os calcis. Relations.—It lies successively upon the Tibialis posticus, the Flexor longus digitorum, the tibia, and the back part of the ankle-joint. It is covered by the deep transverse fascia, which separates it above from the Gastrocnemius and Soleus muscles. In the lower third, w^here it is more superficial, it is covered only by the integument and fascia, and runs parallel with the inner border of the tendo Achillis. It is accompanied by tw^o veins, and by the posterior tibial nerve, which lies at first to the inner side of the artery, but soon crosses it, and is, in the greater part of its course, on its outer side.

Behind the Inner Ankle, the tendons and blood-vessels are arranged in the following order, from within outwards :—First, the tendons of the Tibialis posticus and Flexor longus digitorum, lying in the same groove, behind the inner malleolus, the former being the most internal. External to these is the posterior tibial artery, having a vein on either side; and, still more externally, the posterior tibial nerve. About half an inch nearer the heel is the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis. • Peculiarities in Size.—The posterior tibial is not unfrequently smaller than usual, or absent, its place being supplied by a large peroneal artery, which passes inwards at the lower end of the tibia, and either joins the smaU tibial artery, or continues alone to the sole of the foot. Surface Marking.—The course of the posterior tibial artery is indicated by a line di'awn from a point one inch below the centre of the popliteal space to midway between the tip of the internal malleolus and the centre of the convexity of the heel. Surgical Anatomy.—The application of a ligature to the posterior tibial may be required in cases of wound of the sole of the foot, attended with great hsemorrhage, when the vessel should be tied at the inner ankle. In cases of wound of the posterior tibial, it will be necessary to enlarge the opening so as to expose the vessel at the wounded point, exceptino- where the vessel is injured by a punctured wound from the front of the leg. In cases of anemdsm from wound of the artery low down, the vessel should be tied in the middle of the leg. But in aneurism of the posterior tibial high up, it would be better to tie the femoral artery. To tie the posterior tibial artery at the ankle, a semilunar incision should be made through the integiunent, about tw^o inches and a half in length, midway between the heel and inner ankle, or a little nearer the latter. The subcutaneous cellular tissue having been divided, a strong and dense fascia, the internal annular ligament, is exposed. This ligament is continuous above with the deep fascia of the leg, covers the vessels and nerves, and is intimately adherent to the sheaths of the tendons. This having been cautiously" divided upon a director, the sheath of the vessels is exposed, and, being opened, the artery is seen with one of the venae comites on each side. The anemdsm needle should be passed round the vessel from the heel towards the ankle, in order to avoid the posterior tibial nerve, care being at the same time taken not to include the venae comites. The vessel ma}^ also be tied in the lower third of the leg by making an incision about three inches in length, parallel with the inner margin of the tendo Achillis. The internal saphenous vein being carefully avoided, the two layers of fascia must be divided upon a director, when the artery is exposed along the outer margin of the Flexor longus digitorum, with one of its venae comites on either side, and the nerve lying external to it. To tie the posterior tibial in the middle of the leg is a very difficult operation, on account of the great depth of the vessel from the sm'face. The patient being placed in the recumbent position, the injured limb should rest on its outer side, the knee being partially- bent, and the foot extended, so as to relax the muscles of the- calf. An incision about fom- inches in length should then be made through the integument, a finger's breadth behind the inner margin of the tibia, taking care to avoitl the internal saphenous vein. The deep fascia having been divided, the margin of the Gastrocnemius is exposed, and must be drawn aside. S S 2628 ARTERIES and the tibial attachment of the Solens divided, a director being previously passed beneath it. The artery may now be felt pulsating beneath the deep fascia, about an inch from the margin of the tibia. The fascia having been divided, and the limb placed in such a position as to relax the muscles of the calf as much as possible, the veins should be separated from the artery, and the aneurism needle passed round the vessel from without inwards, so as to avoid wounding the posterior tibial nerve. The branches of the posterior tibial artery are, the Peroneal. Nutrient. Muscular. Communicating. Internal Calcanean. The Peroneal Artery lies, deeply seated, along the back part of the fibular side of the leg. It arises from the posterior tibial, about an inch below the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, passes obliquely outwards to the fibula, and then descends along the inner border of that bone, to the lower third of the leg, where it gives off the anterior peroneal. It then passes across the articulation between the tibia and fibula to the outer side of the os calcis, where it gives off its terminal branches, the external calcanean. Relations.^—This vessel rests at first upon the Tibialis posticus, and then, for the greater part of its course, in a fibrous canal between the origins of the Flexor longus hallucis and Tibialis posticus, covered or surrounded by the fibres of the Flexor longus hallucis. It is covered, in the upper part of its course, by the Soleus and deep transverse fascia ; below, by the Flexor longus hallucis. Plan of the Relations of the Peroneal Aetery In front. Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus hallucis. Outer side. Fibula. Flexor longus hallucis. Behind. Soleus. Deep transverse fascia. Flexor longus hallucis. Peculiarities in Origin.—The peroneal artery may arise three inches below the Popliteus, or from the posterior tibial high up, or even from the popliteal. Its size is more frequently increased than diminished; and then it either reinforces the posterior tibial by its junction with it, or altogether takes the place of the posterior tibial in the lower part of the leg and foot, the latter vessel only existing as a short mus- cular branch. In those rare cases where the peroneal artery is smaller than usual, a branch from the posterior tibial supplies its place ; and a branch from the anterior tibial compensates for the diminished anterior peroneal artery. In one case the peroneal artery has been found entirely wanting. The anterior peroneal is sometimes enlarged, and takes the place of the dorsal artery of the foot. The branches of the peroneal are, the Muscular. Communicating, Nutrient. Posterior Peroneal. Anterior Peroneal. External Calcanean. Muscular branches.—The peroneal artery, in its course, gives off branches to the Soleus, Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus hallucis, and Peronei muscles. The nutrient artery supplies the fibula. The Anterior peroneal pierces the interosseous membrane, about two inches above the outer malleolus, to reach the fore part of the leg, and, passing downI PLANTAE 629 beneath the Peroneus tertins, to the outer ankle, ramifies on the front and outer side of the tarsus, anastomosing with the external malleolar and tarsal arteries. The communicating is given off from the peroneal about an inch from its lower end, and, passing inwards, joins the communicating branch of the posterior tibial. The Posterior peroneal passes down behind the outer ankle to the back of the external malleolus, to terminate in branches which ramify on the outer surface and back of the os calcis. The External calcanean arte the terminal branches of the peroneal artery ; they pass to the outer side of the heel, and communicate with the external malleolar and, on the back of the heel, with the internal calcanean arteries. The nutrient artery of the tibia arises from the posterior tibial, near its origin, and, after supplying a few muscular branches, enters the nutrient canal of that Fig. 379.—The plantar arteries. Fig. 380.—The plantar arteries. bone, which it traverses obliquely from above downwards. This is the largest nutrient artery of bone in the body. The muscular branches of the posterior tibial are distributed to the Soleus and deep muscles along the back of the leg. The communicating branch, to join a similar branch of the peroneal, runs transversely across the back of the tibia, about two inches above its lower end, passing beneath the Flexor longus hallucis. The internal calcanean are several large arteries, which arise from the posterior tibial just before its division ; they are distributed to the fat and integument behind the tendo Achillis and about the heel, and to the muscles on the inner side of the sole, anastomosing with the peroneal and internal malleolar and, on the back of the heel, with the external calcanean arteries. The Internal Plantar Artery (figs. 379, 380), much smaller than the external, passes forwards along the inner side of the foot. It is at first situated above* the * This refers to the erect position of the body. In the ordinary position for dissection, the artery is deeper than the muscle. Superficial view. Deep view.630 ARTERIES Abductor halliicis, and then between it and the Flexor brevis digitornm, both of which it supphes. At the base of the first metatarsal bone, where it has become much- diminished in size, it passes along the inner border of the great toe, inoscu- lating with its digital branch. The External Plantar Artery, much larger than the internal, passes obliquely outwards and forwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. It then turns obliquely inwards to the interval between the bases of the first and second meta- tarsal bones, where it anastomoses with the communicating branch from the dorsalis pedis artery, thus completing the plantar arch. As this artery passes outwards, it is first placed between the os calcis and Abductor hallucis, and then between the Flexor brevis digitorum and Flexor accessorius; and as it passes forwards to the base of the little toe, it lies more superficially between the Flexor brevis digitorum and Abductor minimi digiti, covered by the deep fascia and integument. The remaining portion of the vessel is deeply situated; it extends from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe to the back part of the first interosseous space, and forms the plantar arch; it is convex forwards, lies upon the Interossei muscles, opposite the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones, and is covered by the Adductor obliquus hallucis, the flexor tendons of the toes, and the Lumbricales. Surface Marking.—The course of the internal plantar artery is represented by a line drawn from the mid-point between the tip of the internal malleolus and the centre of the convexity of the heel to the middle of the under surface of the great toe. The external plantar by a line from the same point to within a finger's breadth of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone. The plantar arch is indicated by a line drawn from this point ; i.e. a finger's breadth internal to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone transversely across the foot to the back of the first interosseous space. Surgical Anatomy.—Wounds of the plantar arch are always serious, on account of the depth of the vessel and the important structures which must be interfered with in an attempt to ligature it. Delorme has shown that it may be ligatured from the dorsum of the foot in almost any part of its course by removing a portion of one of the three middle metatarsal bones. Branches.—The plantar arch, besides distributing numerous branches to the muscles, integument, and fascia in the sole, gives off the following branches :— Posterior Perforating. Digital—Anterior Perforating. The Posterior Perforating are three small branches, which ascend through the back part of the three outer interosseous spaces, between the heads of the Dorsal interossei muscles, and anastomose with the interosseous branches from the meta- tarsal artery. The Digital Branches are four in number, and supply the three outer toes and half the second toe. first passes outwards from the outer side of the plantar arch, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe, passing in its course beneath the abductor and short flexor muscles. The second, third, and fourth run forwards along the interosseous spaces, and on arriving at the clefts between the toes divide into collateral branches, which supply the adjacent sides of the three outer toes and the outer side of the second. At the bifurcation of the toes, each digital artery sends upwards, through the fore part of the corresponding interosseous space, a small branch, which inosculates with the interosseous branches of the metatarsal artery. These are the anterior perforating branches. From the arrangement already described of the distribution of the vessels to the toes, it will be seen that both sides of the three outer toes, and the outer side of the second toe, are supplied by branches from the plantar arch ; both sides of the great toe, and the inner side of the second, are supplied by the communi- cating branch of the dorsalis pedis.OF THE VEINS THE Veins are the vessels which serve to return the blood from the capillaries of the different parts of the body to the heart. They consist of two distinct sets of vessels, the pulmonary and systemic. The Pulmonary Ycins are concerned in the circulation in the lungs. Unlike other vessels of this kind, they contain arterial blood, which they return from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart. The Systemic Veins are concerned in the general circulation ; they return the venous blood from the body generally to the right auricle of the heart. The Portal Vein, an appendage to the systemic venous system, is confined to the abdominal cavity, returning the venous blood from the viscera of digestion, and carrying it to the liver by a single trunk of large size, the vena porter. This vessel ramifies in the substance of the liver and breaks up into a minute network of capillaries. These capillaries then re-collect to form the hepatic veins, by which the blood is conveyed to the inferior vena cava. The veins, like the arteries, are found in nearly every tissue of the body. They commence by minute plexuses which receive the blood from the capillaries. The branches which have their commencement in these plexuses unite together into trunks, and these, in their passage towards the heart, constantly increase in size as they receive tributaries, or join other veins. The veins are larger and altogether more numerous than the arteries; hence, the entire capacity of the venous system is much greater than that of the arterial; the pulmonary veins excepted, which do not exceed in capacity the pulmonary arteries. From the combined area of the smaller venous branches being greater than the main trunks, it results that the venous system represents a cone, the summit of which corresponds to the heart, its base to the circumference of the body. In form, the veins are not perfectly cylindrical like the arteries, their walls being collapsed when empty, and the uniformity of their surface being interrupted at intervals by slight constrictions, which indicate the existence of valves in their interior. They usually retain, however, the same calibre as long as they receive no branches. The veins communicate very freely with one another, especially in certain regions of the body ; and this communication exists between the larger trunks as well as between the smaller branches. Thus, in the cavity of the cranium, and between the veins of the neck, where obstruction would be attended with imminent danger to the cerebral venous system, we find that the sinuses and larger veins have large and very frequent anastomoses. The same free communication exists between the veins throughout the whole extent of the spinal canal, and between the veins composing the various venous plexuses in the abdomen and pelvis, as the spermatic, uterine, vesical, and prostatic. The systemic veins are subdivided into three sets : superficial, deep, and sinuses. The Superficial or Cutaneous Veins are found between the layers of the super- ficial fascia, immediately beneath the integument ; they return the blood from these structures, and communicate with the deep veins by perforating the deep fascia.TEINS 632 The Deep Veins accompany the arteries, and are usually enclosed in the same sheath with those vessels. With the smaller arteries—as the radial, ulnar, brachial, tibial, peroneal—they exist generally in pairs, one lying on each side of the vessel, and are called vence comites. The larger arteries—as the axillary, subclavian, pophteal, and femoral—have usually only one accompanying vein. In certain organs of the body, however, the deep veins do not accompany the arteries ; for instance, the veins in the skull and spinal canal, the hepatic veins in the liver, and the larger veins returning blood from the osseous tissue. Sinuses are venous channels, which, in their structure and mode of distribution, differ altogether from the veins. They are found only in the interior of the skull, and are formed by a separation of the layers of the dura mater; their outer coat consisting of fibrous tissue, their inner of an endothelial layer continuous with the lining membrane of the veins. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, the difference in thickness being due to the small amount of elastic and muscular tissues which the veins contain. The superficial veins usually have thicker coats than the deep veins, and the veins of the lower limb are thicker than those of the upper. The minute structure of these vessels has been described in the section on General Anatomy. THE PULMONAEY VEINS The Pulmonary Veins return the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart. They are four in number, two for each lung. The pulmonary differ from other veins in several respects:—i. They carry arterial instead of venous blood. 2. They are destitute of valves. 3. They are only slightly larger than the arteries they accompany. 4. They accompany those vessels singly. They commence in a capillary network, upon the walls of the air-cells, where they are continuous with the ramifications of the pulmonary artery, and, uniting together, form a single trunk for each lobule. These branches, uniting successively, form a single trunk for each lobe, three for the right, and two for the left lung. The vein from the middle lobe of the right lung unites with that from the upper lobe, in most cases, forming two trunks on each side, which open separately into the left auricle. Occasionally, they remain separate; there are then three veins on the right side. Not unfrequently, the two left pulmonary veins terminate by a common opening. TFithin the lung, the branches of the pulmonary artery are in front, the veins behind, and the bronchi heticeen the two. At the root of the lung, the veins are in front, the artery in the middle, and the bronchus heliind. Within the pericardium, their anterior surface is invested by the serous layer of this membrane. The right pulmonary veins pass behind the right auricle and ascending aorta; the left pass in front of the thoracic aorta, with the left pulmonary artery. THE SYSTEMIC VEINS The systemic veins iriay be arranged into three groups :—i. Those of the head and neck, upper extremity, and thorax, which terminate in the superior vena cava. 2. Those of the lower limb, pelvis, and abdomen, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. 3. The cardiac veins, which open directly into the right auricle of the heart. Veins of the Head and Neck The veins of the head and neck may be subdivided into three groups :—-i. The veins of the exterior of the head and face. 2. The veins of the neck. 3. The veins of the diploe and interior of the cranium.OF THE HEAD AND NECK 633 The veins of the exterior of the head and face are, the Frontah Temper aL Supra-orbital. Internal Maxillary. Angular. Temporo-maxillary. Facial. Posterior Auricular. Occipital. The frontal vein commences on the anterior part of the skull by a venous plexus which communicates with the anterior tributaries of the temporal vein. The Fig. 381.—Veins of the head and neck. veins converge to form a single trunk, which runs downwards near the middle hne of the forehead parallel with the vein of the opposite side, and unites with it at the root of the nose, by a transverse branch, called the nasal arch. Occasionally the frontal veins join to form a single trunk, which bifurcates at the root of the nose into the two angular veins. At the root of the nose the veins diverge, and join the suijta-orbital vein, at the inner angle of the orbit, to form the angular vein. The supra-orbital vein commences on the forehead, communicating with the634 VEINS anterior temporal vein, and runs downwards and inwards, superficial to the Occipito-frontalis muscle, receiving tributaries from the neighbouring structures, and joins the frontal vein at the inner angle of the orbit to form the angular vein. The angular vela formed by the junction of the frontal and supra-orbital veins runs obliquely downwards and outwards, on the side of the root of the nose, and receives the veins of the ala nasi on its inner side, and the superior palpebral veins on its outer side ; it moreover communicates with the ophthalmic vein, thus establishing an important anastomosis between this vessel and the cavernous sinus. Some small veins from the dorsum of the nose terminate in the nasal arch. The facial vein commences at the side of the root of the nose, being a direct continuation of the angular vein. It passes obliquely downwards and outwards, beneath the Zygomaticus major and minor muscles, descends along the anterior border of the Masseter, crosses over the body of the lower jaw, with the facial artery, and, passing obliquely outwards and backwards, beneath the Platysma and cervical fascia, unites with a branch of communication from the temporo-maxillary vein, to form a trunk of large size which enters the internal jugular. From near its termination a communicating branch often runs down the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid to join the lower part of the anterior jugular. Tributaries.—The facial vein receives, near the angle of the mouth, communi- cating tributaries of considerable size (the deep facial or anterior internal maxillary vein) from the pterygoid plexus. It is also joined by the inferior palpebral, the superior and inferior labial veins, the buccal veins from the cheek, and the masseteric veins. Below the jaw it receives the submental, the inferior palatine, which returns the blood from the plexus around the tonsil and soft palate ; the submaxillary vein, which commences in the submaxillary gland; and, generally, the ranine vein. Surgical Anatomy.—There are some points about the facial vein which render it of great importance in surgery. It is not so flaccid as are most superficial veins, and, in con- sequence of this, remains more patent when divided. It has, moreover, no valves. It communicates freely with the intracranial circulation, not only at its commencement by its tributaries, the angular and supra-orbital veins, communicating with the ophthalmic vein, a tributary of the cavernous sinus ; but also by its deep branch, which communicates through the pterygoid plexus with the cavernous sinus by branches which pass through the foramen ovale and foramen lacerum medium (see page 643). These facts have an important bearing upon the surgery of some diseases of tlie face. For on account of its patency the facial vein favours septic absorption, and therefore any phlegmonous inflammation of the face following a poisoned wound is liable to set up thrombosis in the facial vein. And on account of its communications with the cerebral sinuses, these thrombi are apt to extend upwards into them, and detached portions may give rise to purulent foci in other parts of the body, and so induce a fatal issue. The Temporal Vein commences by a minute plexus on the side and vertex of the skull, which communicates with the frontal and supra-orbital veins in front, the corresponding vein of the opposite side, and the posterior auricular and occipital veins behind. From this network, anterior and posterior branches are formed Avhich unite above the zygoma, forming the trunk of the vein. This trunk is joined in this situation by a large vein, the middle temporal, which receives the blood from the substance of the Temporal muscle and pierces the fascia at the upper border of the zygoma. The temporal vein then descends between the external auditory meatus and the condyle of the jaw, enters the substance of the parotid gland, and unites with the internal maxillary vein to form the temporo-maxillary vein. Tributaries.—The temporal vein receives in its course some parotid veins, an articular branch from the articulation of the jaw, anterior auricular veins from the external ear, and a vein of large size, the transverse facial, from the side of the face. The middle temporal vein, previous to its junction with the temporal vein, receives a branch, the orbital vein, which is formed by some external palpebral branches, and passes backwards between the layers of the temporal fascia. The Internal Maxillary Vein is a vessel of considerable size, receiving branches which correspond with those of the internal maxillary artery. Thus it receives635 OF THE NECK the middle meningeal veins, the deep temporal, the pterygoid, masseteric, buccal, alveolar, some palatine veins, and the inferior dental. These branches form a large plexus, the pterygoid, which is placed between the Temporal and External pterygoid, and partly between the Pterygoid muscles. This plexus communicates very freely with the facial vein, and with the cavernous sinus, by branches through the foramen Vesalii at the base of the skull. The trunk of the vein then passes backwards, behind the neck of the lower jaw, and unites with the temporal vein, forming the temporo-maxillary vein. The Temporo-maxillary Vein, formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillary veins, descends in the substance of the parotid gland on the outer surface of the external carotid artery, between the ramus of the jaw and the Sterno-mastoid muscle, and divides into two branches, one of which passes inwards to join the facial vein ; the other is joined by the posterior auricular vein and becomes the external jugular. The Posterior Auricular Vein commences upon the side of the head, by a plexus-which communicates with the tributaries of the temporal and occipital veins. The vein descends behind the external ear and joins the temporo-maxillary vein, forming the external jugular. This vessel receives the stylo-mastoid vein, and some tributaries from the back part of the external ear. The Occipital Veins commence at the back part of the vertex of the skull, by a plexus, in a similar manner to the other veins. These unite and form one or two veins, which follow the course of the occipital artery, passing deeply beneath the muscles of the back part of the neck, and terminate in the internal jugular, occasionally in the external jugular vein. As these veins pass across the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, one of them receives the mastoid vein, which thus establishes a communication with the lateral sinus. The veins of the neck, which return the blood from the head and face, are, the The External Jugular Vein receives the greater part of the blood from the exterior of the cranium and deep parts of the face, being formed by the junction of the posterior division of the temporo-maxillary and posterior auricular veins. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, on a level with the angle of the lower jaw, and runs perpendicularly down the neck, in the direction of a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle. In its course it crosses the Sterno-mastoid muscle, and runs parallel with its posterior border as far as its attachment to the clavicle, where it perforates the deep fascia, and terminates in the subclavian vein, on the outer side of or in front of the Scalenus anticus muscle. In the neck it is separated from the Sterno-mastoid by the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia, and is covered by the Platysma, the superficial fascia, and the integument. This vein is crossed about its middle by the super- ficialis colli nerve, and its upper half is accompanied by the auricularis magnus nerve. The external jugular vein varies in size, bearing an inverse proportion to that of the other veins of the neck ; it is occasionally double. It is provided with two pairs of valves, the lower pair being placed at its entrance into the subclavian vein, the upper pair in most cases about an inch and a half above the clavicle. The portion of vein between the two sets of valves is often dilated, and is termed the sinus. These valves do not prevent the regurgitation of the blood, or the passage of injection from below upwards.* * The student may refer to an interesting paper by Dr. Strnthers, 'On Jugular Venesection in Asphyxia, anatomically and experimentally considered, including the Demonstration of Valves in the Veins of the Neck,' in the Edinburgh Medical Journal for November 1856. Veins of the Neck External Jugular. Posterior External Jugular. Vertebral. Anterior Jugular. Internal Jugular.636 VEINS Surgical Anatomy.—Venesection nsed formerly to be performed on the external jugular vein, but is now probably never resorted to. The anatomical point to be remembered in performing this operation is to cut across the fibres of the Platysma m,yoides in opening the vein, so that by their contraction they will expose the orifice in the vein and so allow the flow of blood. Tributaries.—This vein receives the occipital occasionally, the posterior external jugular, and, near its termination, the suprascapular and transverse cervical veins. It communicates with the anterior jugular, and, in the substance of the parotid, receives a large branch of communication from the internal jugular. The Posterior External Jugular Vein commences in the occipital region and returns the blood from the integument and superficial muscles in the upper and back part of the neck, lying between the Splenius and Trapezius muscles. It runs down the back part of the neck, and opens into the external jugular just below the middle of its course. The Anterior Jugular Vein commences near the hyoid bone from the con- vergence of several superficial veins from the submaxillary region. It passes down between the median line and the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and, at the lower part of the neck, passes beneath that muscle to open into the termination of the external jugular, or into the subclavian vein (fig. 388). This vein varies considerably in size, bearing almost always an inverse proportion to the external jugular. Most frequently there are two anterior jugulars, a right and left ; but occasionally only one. This vein receives some laryngeal veins, and occasionally a small thyroid vein. Just above the sternum, the two anterior jugular veins communicate by a transverse trunk, which receives tributaries from the inferior thyroid veins. It also communicates with the internal jugular. There are no valves in this vein. The Internal Jugular Vein collects the blood from the interior of the cra,nium, from the superficial parts of the face, and from the neck. It commences just external to the jugular foramen, at the base of the skull, being formed by the coalescence of the lateral and inferior petrosal sinuses (fig. 386). At its origin it is somewhat dilated, and this dilatation is called the sinus, or gulf, of the internal jugular vein. It runs down the side of the neck in a vertical direction, lying at first on the outer side of the internal carotid, and then on the outer side of the common carotid, and at the root of the neck unites with the subclavian vein to form the innominate vein. The internal jugular vein, at its commencement, lies upon the Kectus capitis lateralis, and behind the internal carotid and the nerves passing through the jugular foramen ; lower down, the vein and artery lie upon the same plane, the glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves passing forwards between them ; the pneumogastric descends between and behind them, in the same sheath, and the spinal accessory passes obliquely outwards, behind the vein. At the root of the neck the vein of the right side is placed at a little distance from the artery ; on the left side, it usually lies over the artery at its lower part. The right internal jugular vein crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. The vein is of considerable size, but varies in different individuals, the left one being usually the smaller. It is provided with a pair of valves, which are placed at its point of termination, or from half to three-quarters of an inch above it. Tributaries.—This vein receives in its course the facial, lingual, pharyngeal, superior and middle thyroid veins, and sometimes the occipital. At its point of junction with the branch common to the tempore-maxillary and facial veins it becomes greatly increased in size. The lingual veins commence on the dorsum, sides, and under surface of the tongue, and, passing backwards, following the course of the lingual artery and its branches, terminate in the internal jugular. Sometimes the ranine vein, which is a branch of considerable size, commencing below the tip of the tongue, joins the lingual. Generally, however, it passes backwards, crosses the Hyo-glossus muscle in company wdth the hypoglossal nerve, and joins the facial.OF THE DIPLOE 637 The pharyngeal vein commences in a minute plexus, the pharyngeal, at the back part and sides of the pharynx, and, after receiving meningeal tributaries, and the Vidian and spheno-palatine veins, terminates in the internal jugular. It occasionally opens into the facial, lingual, or superior thyroid vein. The superior thyroid vein commences in the substance and on the surface of the thyroid gland, by tributaries corresponding with the branches of the superior thyroid artery, and terminates in the upper part of the internal jugular vein. The middle thyroid vein collects the blood from the lov^^er part of the lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, and, being joined by some veins from the larynx and trachea, terminates in the lower part of the internal jugular vein. The facial and occipital veins have been described above. Surgical Anatomy.—The internal jugular vein occasionally requires ligature in cases of septic thrombosis of the lateral sinus from suppuration in the middle ear, in order to prevent embolism of the thoracic viscera. This operation has been performed recently in several cases, with the most satisfactory results. The cases are generally those of chronic disease of the middle ear, with discharge of pus which perhaps has existed for many years. The patient is seized with acute septic inflammation, spreading to the mastoid cells, and consequent on this septic thrombosis of the lateral sinus extending to the internal jugular vein. Such cases are always extremely grave, for there is a danger of a portion of the septic clot being detached and causing septic embolism in the thoracic viscera. This may be mechanically prevented by ligature of the internal jugular vein in the middle of the neck. The operation is a comparatively simple one, and may be performed by an incision similar to that emploj^ed in ligature of the common carotid artery. The Vertebral Vein commences in the occipital region, by numerous small tributaries, from the deep muscles at the upper and back part of the neck ; these pass outwards and enter the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, and descend, forming a dense plexus around the vertebral artery, in the canal formed by the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. This plexus unites at the lower part of the neck into two main trunks, one of which emerges from the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and the others through that of the seventh, and, uniting, form a single vessel, which terminates at the root of the neck in the back part of the innominate vein near its origin, its mouth being- guarded by a pair of valves. On the right side, it crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. Tributaries.—The vertebral vein receives in its course a vein from the inside of the skull through the posterior condyloid foramen ; muscular veins, from the muscles in the prevertebral region; dorsi-spinal veins, from the back part of the cervical portion of the spine; meningo-rachidian veins, from the interior of the spinal canal; the anterior and posterior vertebral veins ; and close to its termina- tion it is joined by a small vein from the first intercostal space which accompanies the superior intercostal artery. The anterior vertebral vein commences in a plexus around the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae, descends in company with the ascending cervical artery between the Scalenus anticus and Rectus capitis anticus major muscles, and opens into the vertebral vein just before its termination. The posterior vertebral vein (the deep cervical) accompanies the profunda cervicis artery, lying between the Complexus and Semispinalis colli. It commences in the suboccipital region by communicating branches from the occipital vein and tributaries from the deep muscles at the back of the neck. If receives tribu- taries from the plexuses around the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae, and terminates in the lower end of the vertebral vein. Veins of the Diploe The diploe of the cranial bones is channelled in the adult by a number of tortuous canals, which are lined by a more or less complete layer of compact tissue. The veins they contain are large and capacious, their walls being thin, and formed only of endothelium resting upon a layer of elastic tissue, and they pre- sent, at irregular intervals, pouch-like dilatations, or culs-de-sac, which serve asVEINS 638 reservoirs for the blood. These are the veins of the diploe; they can only be displayed by removing the outer table of the skull. In adult life, as long as the cranial bones are distinct and separable, these veins are confined to the particular bones; but in old age, Avhen the sutures are united, they communicate with each other, and increase in size. These vessels communicate, in the interior of the cranium, with the meningeal veins, and Avith the sinuses of the dura mater; and, on the exterior of the skull, with the veins of the pericranium. They are divided into the f ron tal, which opens, into the supra- orbital vein, by an aperture in the supra-orbital notch ; the anterior temporal, which is confined chiefly to the frontal bone, and opens into one of the deep temporal veins, after escaping by an aperture in the great wing of the sphenoid; the posterior temporal, which is confined to the parietal bone, and terminates in the lateral sinus by an aperture at the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone ; and the occipital, the largest of the four, which is confined to the occipital Fig. 382.—Veins of the diploe as displayed by the removal of the outer table of the skull. bone, and opens either into the occipital vein, or internally into the lateral sinus or torcular Herophili. Cerebral Veins The Cerebral Veins are remarkable for the extreme thinness of their coats in consequence of the muscular tissue in them being wanting, and for the absence of valves. They may be divided into two sets : the superficial which are placed on the surface, and the deep veins which occupy the interior of the organ. The Superficial Cerebral Veins ramify upon the surface of the brain, being lodged in the sulci, between the convolutions, a few running across the convolu- tions. They receive branches from the substance of the brain, and terminate in the sinuses. They are named, from the position they occupy, superior, median, and inferior cerebral veins. The Superior Cerebral Veins, eight to twelve in number on each side, return the blood from the convolutions on the superior surface of the hemisphere ; they pass forwards and inwards towards the great longitudinal fissure, where they receive the median cerebral veins ; near their termination, they become invested with a tubular sheath of the arachnoid membrane, and open into the superior longitudinal sinus, in the opposite direction to the course of the blood.SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER 639 The Median Cerebral Veins return the blood from the convolutions of the mesial surface of the corresponding hemisphere ; they open into the superior cerebral veins ; or occasionally into the inferior longitudinal sinus. The Inferior Cerebral Veins ramify on the lower part of the outer and on the under surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Some, collecting tributaries from the under surface of the anterior lobes of the brain, terminate in the cavernous sinus. One vein of large size, the middle cerebral vein, commences on the under surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and, running along the fissure of Sylvius, opens into the cavernous sinus. Another large vein, the great anastomotic vein of Trolard, commences on the parietal lobe, runs along the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and opens into the anterior part of the cavernous sinus under the lesser wing of the sphenoid. Others commence on the under surface of the base of the brain, and unite to form from three to five veins, which open into the superior petrosal and lateral sinuses from before backwards. The Deep Cerebral, or Ventricular Veins (vence Galeni), are two in number. They are formed by the union of two veins, the vena corporis striati, and the choroid vein, on either side. They run backwards, parallel with one another, between the layers of the velum interpositum, and pass out of the brain at the great transverse fissure, between the posterior extremity, or sijleniuni, of the corpus callosum and the tubercula quadrigemina, to enter the straight sinus. The two veins usually unite to form one before opening into the straight sinus. The vena corporis striati commences in the groove between the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus, receives numerous veins from both of these parts, and unites behind the anterior pillar of the fornix with the choroid vein, to form one of the venffi Galeni. The choroid vein runs along the whole length of the outer border of the choroid plexus, receiving veins from the hippocampus major, the fornix and corpus callosum, and unites, at the anterior extremity of the choroid plexus, with the vein of the corpus sti'iatum. The Cerebellar Veins occupy the surface of the cerebellum, and are disposed in three sets, superior, inferior, and lateral. The superior pass forwards and inwards, across the superior vermiform process, and terminate in the straight sinus ; some open into the vena9 Galeni. The infei-ior cerebellar veins, of large size, run transversely outwards, and terminate by two or three trunks in the lateral sinuses. The lateral anterior cerebellar veins terminate in the superior petrosal sinuses. The perivascular lymph-sheaths alluded to above (see page 55) are especially found in connection with the vessels of the brain. These vessels are enclosed in a sheath, which acts as a lymphatic channel, through which the lymph is carried to the subarachnoid and subdural spaces, from which it is returned into the general circulation. Sinuses of the Dura Matek The sinuses of the dura mater are venous channels, analogous to the veins, their outer coat being formed by the dura mater ; their inner, by a continuation of the lining membrane of the veins. They are fifteen in number, and are divided into two sets:—e. Those situated at the upper and back part of the skull; 2. those at the base of the skull. The former are, the Superior Longitudinal. Straight Sinus. Inferior Longitudinal. Lateral Sinuses. Occipital Sinus. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus occupies the attached margin of the falx cerebri. Commencing at the foramen caecum, through which it constantly com- municates by a small branch with the veins of the nasal fossae, it runs from before backwards, grooving the inner surface of the frontal, the adjacent margins of the two parietal, and the superior division of the crucial ridge of the occipital bone, and terminates by opening into the torcular Herophili. The sinus is triangular in form, narrow in front, and gradually increasing in size as it passes backwards.640 VEINS On examining its inner surface, it presents the internal openings of the superior cerebral veins, which run, for the most part, from behind forwards, and open chiefly at the back part of the sinus, their orifices being concealed by fibrous folds ; numerous fibrous bands [cJiordcB Willisii) are also seen, extending transversely across the inferior angle of the sinus ; and, lastly, some small, white, projecting bodies, the glandulcB Pacchioni. This sinus receives the superior cerebral veins, numerous veins from the diploe and dura mater, and, at the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture, veins from the pericranium, which pass through the parietal foramen. The torcular Herophili is the dilated extremity of the superior longitudinal sinus. It is of irregular form, and is lodged on one side (generally the right) of the internal occipital protuberance. From it the lateral sinus of the side to which it is deflected is derived. It receives also the blood from the occipital sinus. The Inferior Longitudinal Sinus, more correctly described as the inferior longitudinal vein, is contained in the posterior part of the free margin of the falx cerebri. It is of a cylindrical form, increases in size as it passes backwards, and terminates in the straight sinus. It receives several veins from the falx cerebri, and occasionally a few from the mesial surface of the hemispheres. Fig. 383.—Vertical section of the skull, showing the sinuses of the dura mater. Foramen ccecitm The Straight Sinus is situated at the line of junction of the falx cerebri with the tentorium. It is triangular in form, increases in size as it proceeds backwards, and runs obliquely downwards and backwards from the termination of the inferior longitudinal sinus to the lateral sinus of the opposite side to that into which the superior longitudinal sinus is prolonged. It communicates by a cross branch with the torcular Herophili. Beside the inferior longitudinal sinus, it receives the ven^e Galeni and the superior cerebellar veins. A few transverse bands cross its interior. The Lateral Sinuses are of large size, and are situated in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli. They commence at the internal occipital protuberance ; the one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the superior longi- tudinal sinus, the other of the straight sinus. They pass horizontally outwards to the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, then curve downwards and inwards on each side to reach the jugular foramen, where they terminate in the internal jugular vein. Each sinus rests, in its course, upon the inner surface of the occipital, the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, the mastoid portion of the temporal, and on the occipital, again, just before its termination. These sinusesSINUSES OF THE DUEA MATEE 641 are frequently of unequal size, that formed by the superior longitudinal sinus being the larger, and they increase in size as they proceed from behind forwards. The horizontal portion is of a triangular form, the curved portion semicylindrical. Their inner surface is smooth, and not crossed by the fibrous bands found in the other sinuses. These sinuses receive the blood from the superior petrosal sinuses at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and they unite with the inferior petrosal sinus, just external to the jugular foramen, to form the internal jugular vein (fig. 386). They communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and posterior condyloid veins, and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploe. The Occipital is the smallest of the cranial sinuses. It is generally single, but occasionally there are two. It is situated in the attached margin of the falx cere- belli. It commences by several small veins around the margin of the foramen magnum, one of which joins the termination of the lateral sinus ; it communicates with the posterior spinal veins, and terminates in the torcular Herophili. The sinuses at the base of the skull are, the Cavernous. Superior Petrosal. Circular. Inferior Petrosal. Transverse. The Cavernous Sinuses are named from their presenting a reticulated structure. They are two in number, of large size, and placed one on each side of the sella Fig. 384.—Plan showing the relative position of the structures in the right cavernous sinus, viewed from behind. turcica, extending from the sphenoidal fissure to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; they receive anteriorly the ophthalmic vein through the sphenoidal fissure, and open behind into the petrosal sinuses. On the inner wall of each sinus is found the internal carotid artery, accompanied by filaments of the carotid plexus and by the sixth nerve; and on its outer wall, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. These parts are separated from the blood flowing along the sinus by the lining membrane, which is continuous with the inner coat of the veins. The cavity of the sinus, which is larger behind than in front, is intersected by filaments of fibrous tissue and small vessels. The cavernous sinuses receive some of the cerebral veins; they communicate with the lateral sinuses by means of the superior and inferior petrosal, and with the facial vein through the ophthalmic. They also communicate with each other by means of the circular sinus. Surgical Anatomy.—An arterio-venous communication may be established between the cavernous sinus and the carotid artery, as it lies in it, giving rise to a pulsating tumour in the orbit. These communications may be the result of injury, such as a bullet wound, a stab, or a blow or fall sufficiently severe to cause a fracture of the base of the skull in this situation ; or they may occur idiopathically, from the rupture of an aneurism or a diseased condition of the internal carotid artery. The disease begins with sudden noise and pain in the head, followed by exophthalmos, and development of a pulsating tumour at the margin of the orbit, with thrill and the characteristic bruit. In some cases the opposite orbit becomes affected by the passage of the arterial blood into the opposite sinus by means of the circular sinus. Or the arterial blood may find its way through the emissary veins (see page 643) into the pterygoid plexus, and thence into the vems ot the face. Pulsating tumours of the orbit mav also be due to traumatic aneurism of one of the T T642 VEINS orbital arteries, and symptoms resembling those of pulsating tmnom- may be produced by pressure on the ophthalmic yein, as it enters the sinus, by an aneurism of the internal carotid artery. The ophthalmic is a large yein, which connects the angular yein at the inner angle of the orbit with the cayernous sinus ; it pursues the same course as the ophthalmic artery, and receiyes tributaries corresponding to the branches deriyed from that yessel. Forming a short single trunk, it passes through the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure, and terminates in the cayernous sinus. The Inferior Ophthalmic Vein.—Sometimes the veins from the floor of the orbit collect into a separate trunk, the inferior ophthalmic vein, which either passes out of the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure to join the pterygoid plexus of veins ; or else, passing backwards through the sphenoidal fissure, it enters the cayernous sinus, either by a separate opening or in common with the ophthalmic vein. The Circular Sinus is formed by two transverse vessels, which connect together Fict. 385.—The sinuses at the base of the skull. Torett la r Heropliili the two cavernous sinuses; the one passing in front and the other behind the pituitary body, and thus forming with the cavernous sinuses a venous circle around the body. The anterior one is usually the larger of the two, and one or other is occasionally found to be absent. The Superior Petrosal Sinus is situated along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, in the front part of the attached margin of the tentorium. It is small and narrow, and connects together the cavernous and lateral sinuses at each side. It receives a cerebellar vein [anterior lateral cerebellar) from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and a vein from the internal ear. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus is situated in the groove formed by the junction of the posterior border of the petrous portion of the temporal with the basilar process of the occipital. It commences in front at the termination of the cavernous sinus, and behind joins the lateral sinus after it has passed through the jugular foramen ; the junction of these two sinuses forming the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The junction of the two sinuses takes place at the lower border of, or just64,3 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER external to, the jugular foramen. The exact relation of the parts to one another in the foramen is as follows : the inferior petrosal sinus is in front, with the meningeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery, and is directed obliquely downwards and backwards ; the lateral sinus is situated at the back part of the foramen with a meningeal branch of the occipital artery, and between the two are the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves. These three sets of structures are divided from each other by two processes of fibrous tissue. The junction of the sinuses takes place superficial to the nerves, so that these latter lie a little internal to the venous channels in the foramen (see fig. 386.) These sinuses are semicylindrical in form. The Transverse Sinus, or basilar sinus, consists of several interlacing veins between the layers of the dura mater over the basilar process of the occipital bone, which serve to connect the two inferior petrosal sinuses. With them the anterior spinal veins communicate. Fig. 386.—Relation of structures in jugular foramen. Emissary Veins.—The emissary veins are vessels which pass through apertures in the cranial wall and establish communications between the sinuses inside the skull and the veins external to it. Some of these are always present, others only occasionally so. They vary much in size in different individuals. The principal emissary veins are the following :—i. A vein, almost always present, which passes through the mastoid foramen and connects the lateral sinus with the posterior auricular or with an occipital vein. 2. A vein, which passes through the parietal foramen and connects the superior longitudinal sinus with the veins of the scalp. 3. A plexus of minute veins, which pass through the anterior condyloid foramen and connect the occipital sinus with the vertebral vein and deep veins of the neck. 4. An inconstant vein, which passes through the posterior condyloid fora- men and connects the lateral sinus with the deep veins of the neck. 5. One or two veins of considerable size, which pass through the foramen ovale and connect the cavernous sinus with the pterygoid and pharyngeal plexuses. 6. Two or three small veins, which pass through the foramen lacerum medium and connect the644 VEINS cavernous sinus with the pterygoid ani a small vein passing through the for; Fig. 387,—The superficial veins of the upper extremity. pharyngeal plexuses. 7. There is sometimes men of Vesalius connecting the same parts. 8. A plexus of veins passing through the carotid canal and connecting the cavernous sinus Avith the internal jugular vein. Surgical Anatomy.—These emissary veins are of great importance in surgery. In addition to them there are, however, other communica- tions between the intra- and extra-cranial circula- tion. As, for instance, the communication of the angular and supra-orbital veins with the ophthal- mic vein, at the inner angle of the orbit (page 634) and the communication of the veins of the scalp with the diploic veins (page 638). Through these communications inflammatory processes commencing on the outside of the skull may travel inwards, leading to osteo-phlebitis of the diploe and inflammation of the membranes of the brain. To this must be attributed one of the principal dangers of scalp wounds and other injuries of the scalp. By means of these emissary veins blood may be abstracted almost directly from the intra- cranial circulation. For instance, leeches applied behind the ear abstract blood almost directly from the lateral sinus, through the vein passing through the mastoid foramen. Again, epistaxis in children will frequently relieve severe headache, the blood which flows from the nose being derived from the longitudinal sinus by means of the vein which passes through the foramen caecum, which is another communication between the intra- cranial and extracranial circulation which is constantly found in children. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX The Veins of the Upper Extremity are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The Superficial Veins are placed immedi- ately beneath the integument between the two layers of superficial fascia. The Deep Veins accompany the arteries, and constitute the venas comites of those vessels. Both sets of vessels are provided with valves wdiich are more numerous in the deep than in the superficial. The superficial veins of the upper ex- tremity are, the Superficial Veins of the Hand. Anterior Ulnar. Posterior Ulnar. Common Ulnar. Radial. Median. Median Basilic. Median Cephalic. Basilic. Cephalic. The Superficial Veins of the Hand and Fingers are principally situated on theOF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 645 dorsal surface, and form two plexuses, an inner and outer, on the back of the hand. The inner plexus is formed by the veins from the little finger (ve7ia salvatella), the ring finger, and the ulnar side of the middle finger; from it the anterior and posterior ulnar veins are derived. The outer plexus is formed by veins from the thumb, the index finger, and radial side of the middle finger ; from it the radial vein is derived. These two plexuses communicate on the back of the hand, forming the superficial arch of veins in this situation. The superficial veins from the palm of the hand form a plexus in front of the wrist, from which the median vein is derived. The Anterior Ulnar Vein commences on the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the hand and wrist, and ascends along the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where it joins with the posterior ulnar vein to form the common ulnar. Occasionally it opens separately into the median basilic vein. It communicates with branches of the median vein in front, and with the posterior ulnar behind. The Posterior Ulnar Vein commences on the posterior surface of the ulnar side of the wrist. It runs on the posterior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm, and just below the elbow unites with the anterior ulnar vein to form the common ulnar, or else joins the median basilic to form the basilic. It communicates with the deep veins of the palm by a branch which emerges from beneath the Abductor minimi digiti muscle. The Common Ulnar is a short trunk which is not constant. When it exists it is formed by the junction of the two preceding veins, and, passing upwards and outwards, joins the median basilic to form the basilic vein. "When it does not exist, the anterior and posterior ulnar veins open separately into the median basilic vein. The Radial Vein commences from the dorsal surface of the wrist, communi- cating with the deep veins of the palm by a branch which passes through the first interosseous space. It forms a large vessel, which ascends along the radial side of the forearm, and receives numerous veins from both its surfaces. At the bend of the elbow it unites with the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein. The Median Vein ascends on the front of the forearm, and communicates with the anterior ulnar and radial veins. At the bend of the elbow it receives a branch of communication from the deep veins, and divides into two branches, the median cephalic and median basilic, which diverge from each other as they ascend. The Median Cephalic, usually the smaller of the two, passes outwards in the groove between the Supinator longus and Biceps muscles, and joins with the radial to form the cephalic vein. The branches of the external cutaneous nerve pass beneath this vessel. The Median Basilic Vein passes obliquely inwards, in the groove between the Biceps and Pronator radii teres, and joins the common ulnar to form the basihc. This vein passes in front of the brachial artery, from which it is separated by a fibrous expansion (the bicipital fascia) which is given off from the tendon of the Biceps to the fascia covering the Flexor muscles of the forearm. Filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve pass in front as well as behind this vessel.* Venesection is usually performed at the bend of the elbow, and as a matter of practice the largest vein in this situation is commonly selected. This is usaally the median basihc, and there are anatomical advantages and disadvantages in selecting this vein. The advantages are, that in addition to its being the largest, and therefore yielding a greater supply of blood, it is the least movable and can be easily steadied on the bicipital fascia on which it rests. The disadvantages are, that it is in close relationship with the brachial artery, separated only by the bicipital fascia; and formerly, when venesection was * Cruveilhier says : ' Numerous varieties are observed in the disposition of the veins of the elbow ; sometimes the common median vein is wanting; but in those cases, its two Jbranches are furnished by the radial vein, and the cephalic is almost always in a rudimentary condition. In other cases, only two veins are found at the bend of the elbo^y, the radial and ulnar, which are continuous, without any demarcation, with the cephalic and basilic'646 VEINS frequently practised, arterio-venous aneurism was no uncommon result of this practice. Another disadvantage is, that the median basilic is crossed b}^ some of the branches of the internal cutaneous nerve, and these may be divided in the operation, giving rise to ' traumatic neuralgia of extreme intensity ' (Tillaux). The Basilic Vein is of considerable size, formed by the coalescence of the common ulnar vein with the median basilic. It passes upwards along the inner side of the Biceps muscle, pierces the deep fascia a Httle below the middle of the arm, and, ascending in the course of the brachial artery, terminates by joining the venfP comites of that vessel to form the axillary vein. The Cephalic Vein courses along the outer border of the Biceps muscle, lying in the same groove with the upper external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, to the upper third of the arm ; it then passes in the interval between the Pectoralis major and Deltoid muscles, lying in the same groove with the descending branch of the acromial-thoracic artery. It pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, and terminates in the axillary vein just below^ the clavicle. This vein is occasionally connected with the external jugular or subclavian, by a branch which passes from it upwards in front of the clavicle. The Deep Veins of the Upper Extremity follow the course of the arteries, forming their venae comites. They are generally two in number, one lying on each side of the corresponding artery, and they are connected at intervals by short transverse branches. There are two digital veins, accompanying each artery along the sides of the fingers : these, uniting at their base, pass along the interosseous spaces in the palm, and terminate in the two venae comites which accompany the superficial palmar arch. Branches from these vessels on the radial side of the hand accom- pany the superficialis vol^, and on the ulnar side terminate in the deep ulnar veins. The deep ulnar veins, as they pass in front of the WTist, communicate wdth the interosseous and superficial veins, and, at the elbow, unite with the deep radial veins to form the venae comites of the brachial artery. The Interosseous Veins accompany the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior interosseous veins commence in front of the wrist, where they communicate wdth the deep radial and ulnar veins; at the upper part of the forearm they receive the posterior interosseous veins, and terminate in the venae comites of the ulnar artery. The Deep Palmar Veins accompany the deep palmar arch, being formed by tributaries which accompany the ramifications of that vessel. They communicate with the deep ulnar veins at the inner side of the hand, and on the outer side terminate in the venae comites of the radial artery. At the w^rist, they receive a dorsal and a palmar tributary from the thumb, and unite with the deep radial veins. Accompanying the radial artery, these vessels terminate in the venae comites of the brachial artery. The Brachial Veins are placed one on each side of the brachial artery, receiving tributaries corresponding with the branches given off from that vessel; at the low^er margin of the axilla they unite mth the basilic to form the axillary vein. These deep veins have numerous anastomoses, not only with each other, but also with the superficial veins. The Axillary Vein is of large size, and formed by the junction of the ven^e comites of the brachial artery with the basilic vein. It commences at the lower part of the axillary space, increases in size as it ascends, by receiving tributaries corresponding with the branches of the axillary artery, and terminates imme- diately beneath the clavicle at the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the subcla\ian vein. This vessel is covered in front by the Pectoral muscles and costo-coracoid membrane, and lies on the thoracic side of the axillary artery, which it partially overlaps. Near its termination it receives the cephalic vein. This vein is provided with a pair of valves, opposite the lower border of the Sub- scapularis muscle ; valves are also found at the termination of the cephalic and subscapular veins.647 IXXOMIXATE, AXD THEIR TEIBUTAEIES Surgical Anatomy.—There are several points of surgical interest in connection with the axillarj' vein. Being more superficial, larger, and shghtly overlapping the axillary artery, it is more liable to be womided in the operation of extirpation of the axillary glands, especially as these glands, when diseased, are apt to become adh.erent to the vessel. "NMien wounded, there is always a danger of air being drawn into its interior, and death resulting. This is due not only to the fact that it is near the thorax and therefore hable to be in- fluenced by the respiratory movements, but also because it is adherent by its anterior sm-face to the costo-coracoid membrane, and therefore if w^ounded is likely to remain j)atulous and favoiu^ the chance of air being sucked in. This adhesion of the vein to the fascia prevents its collapsmg, and therefore favours the finious bleeding which takes place in these cases. To avoid woimding the axillary vein in the extirpation of cancerous glands h-om the axilla, no sharp cutting instruments should be used after the axillary cavity has been freely exposed, and care should be taken to use no imdue force in isolating the glands. Should the vein be so embedded in the malignant deposit that the latter cannot be removed without taking away a part of the vein, this must be done, the vessel having been first Hgatured above and below. The Subclavian Vein, the continuation of the axillary, extends from the lower border of the first rib to the inner end of the sterno-cla^icular articulation, where it unites with the internal jugular to form the innominate vein. It is in relation, in front, with the clavicle and Subclavius muscle; behind, with the subclavian artery, from which it is separated internally by the Scalenus anticus muscle and phrenic nerve. Below, it rests in a depression on the first rib and up»on the x^leura. Above, it is covered by the cervical fascia and integument. The subclavian vein occasionally rises in the neck to a level with the third part of the subclavian artery, and in two instances has been seen passing with this vessel behind the Scalenus anticus. This vessel is usually provided with valves about an inch from its termination in the innominate, just external to the entrance of the external jugular vein. Tributaries.—It receives the external and anterior jugular veins and a small branch from the cephalic, outside the Scalenus ; and on the inner side of that muscle, the internal jugular vein. At the angle of junction with the internal jugular, the left subclavian vein receives the thoracic duct; while the right sub- clavian vein receives the right lymphatic duct. The Innominate or Brachio-cephalic Veins (fig. 388) are tw-o large trunks, placed one on each side of the root of the neck, and formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins of the corresponding side. The Right Innominate Vein is a short vessel, an inch in length, w^hich com- mences at the inner end of the clavicle, and, passing almost vertically downwards, joins with the left innominate vein just below the cartilage of the first rib, close to the right border of the sternum, to form the superior vena cava. It lies superficial and external to the innominate artery ; on its right side the plem-a is interposed between it and the apex of the lung. This vein, at the angle of junction of the internal jugular with the subclavian, receives the right vertebral vein ; and, lower down, the right internal mammary, right inferior thyroid, and sometimes the right superior intercostal veins. The Left Innominate Vein, about two and a half inches in length, and larger than the right, passes from left to right across the upper and front part of the chest, at the same time inclining downwards, to unite with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the superior vena cava. It is in relation, in front, with the first piece of the sternum, from which it is separated by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno- thyroid muscles, the thymus gland or its remains, and some loose areolar tissue. Behind, it lies across the roots of the three large arteries arising from the arch of the aorta. This vessel is joined by the left vertebral, left internal mammary, left inferior thyroid, and the left superior intercostal veins, and occasionally some thymic and pericardiac veins. There are no valves in the innominate veins. Peculiarities.—Sometimes the innominate veins open separately into the right amicle ; in such cases the right vein takes the ordinary com'se of the superior vena cava; but the left vein, after commmiicating by a small branch with the right one. passes in fi'ont of the root of the left lung, and. turning to the back of the heart, receives the cardiac veins, and terminates in the back of the right aui'icle. This occasional condition of the veins in the648 VEINS Fig. 388.—The venae cavae and azygos veins, with tlieir formative branches. A)iterior jugHlar Sujjerior thyroid Middle thyroid External jugular MedKctnuil d- pericai dtac adult is a regular one in the foetus at an early period, and the two vessels are persistent in birds and some mamma- lia. The subsequent changes which take place in these ves- sels are the following : The communicating branch be- tween the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left in- nominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is obli- terated as far as the heart, where it remains pervious, and forms the coronary sinus: a remnant of the obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial fold of the peri- cardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corre- sponding with those de- rived from it. The tAvo veins of each side unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innomi- nate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four, in number, arise in the venous plexus on the thyroid body, commu- nicating with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, be- hind the Sterno-thyroid muscle, communicating with its fellow by trans- verse branches, and termi- nates in the left innomi- nate vein. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right innominate vein, just at its junction with the su- perior vena cava. These veins receive oesophageal, tracheal, and inferior laryngeal veins, and are provided with valves at their termin- ation in the innominate veins. The Superior Intercostal Veins return the blood from the upper intercostal spaces. Suprarenal649 VENA CAVA The right superior intercostal, much smaller than the left, closely corresponds with the superior intercostal artery, receiving the blood from the first, or first and second intercostal spaces, and, passing downwards, terminates in the vena azygos major. Occasionally it opens into the right innominate vein. The left sttjjei^ior intercostal is always larger than the right, but varies in size in different subjects, being small when the left upper azygos vein is large, and vice versa. It is usually formed by branches from the two or three upper intercostal spaces, and, passing across the arch of the aorta, terminates in the left innominate vein. The left bronchial vein and the left superior phrenic open into it. The Superior Vena Cava receives the blood which is conveyed to the heart from the whole of the upper half of the body. It is a short trunk, varying from two inches and a half to three inches in length, formed by the junction of the two innominate veins. It commences immediately below the cartilage of the first rib close to the sternum on the right side, and, descending vertically, enters the pericardium about an inch and a half above the heart, and terminates in the upper part of the right auricle opposite the upper border of the third left costal cartilage. In its course it describes a slight curve, the convexity of which is turned to the right side. Relations.—In front, with the pericardium and process of cervical fascia which is continuous with it; this separates it from the thymus gland, and from thq sternum; behind, with the root of the right lung. On its right side, with the phrenic nerve and right pleura ; on its left side, with the commencement of the innominate artery and the ascending part of the aorta. The portion contained within the pericardium is covered by the serous layer of that membrane, in its anterior three-fourths. It receives the vena azygos major just before it enters the pericardium, and several small veins from the pericardium and parts in the mediastinum. The superior vena cava has no valves. The Azygos Veins connect together the superior and inferior venae cavffi, supplying the place of those vessels in the part of the chest which is occupied by the heart. The larger, or right azygos vein (vena azygos major), commences opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, by a branch from the right lumbar veins (the ascending lumbar); sometimes by a branch from the right renal vein, or from the inferior vena cava. It enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and passes along the rigEt side of the vertebral column to the fourth dorsal vertebra, where it arches forward over the root of the right lung, and terminates in the superior vena cava, just before that vessel enters the pericardium. Whilst passing through the aortic opening of the Diaphragm, it lies with the thoracic duct on the right side of the aorta ; and in the thorax, it lies upon the intercostal arteries, on the right side of the aorta and thoracic duct, and is partly covered by pleura. Tributaries.—It receives nine or ten lower intercostal veins of the right side, the vena azygos minor, several oesophageal, mediastinal, and pericardial veins ; near its termination, the right bronchial vein ; and generally the right superior intercostal vein. A few imperfect valves are found in this vein ; but its tributaries are provided with complete valves. The intercostal veins on the left side, below the two or three upper intercostal spaces, usually form two trunks, named the left lower, and the left upper, azygos veins. The left lower, or smaller azygos vein (vena azygos minor), commences in the lumbar region, by a branch from one of the lumbar veins (ascending lumbar), or from the left renal. It passes into the thorax, through the left crus of the Diaphragm, and, ascending on the left side of the spine, as high as the seventh or eighth dorsal vertebra, passes across the column, behind the aorta and thoracic duct, to terminate in the right azygos vein. It receives the four or five lower intercostal veins of the left side, and some oesophageal and mediastinal veins. The left U2:)per azygos vein varies according to the size of the left superior650 VEINS intercostal. It receives veins from the intercostal spaces between the left superior intercostal vein and highest tributary of the left lower azygos. They are usually two or three in number, and join to form a trunk which ends in the right azygos vein, or in the left lower azygos. It sometimes receives the left bronchial vein. When this vein is small, or altogether wanting, the left superior intercostal vein will extend as low as the fifth or sixth intercostal space.* Surgical Anatomy.—In obstruction of the inferior vena cava, the azj^gos veins are one of the principal means by which the venous circulation is carried on, connecting as they do the superior and inferior venae cavae and communicating with the common iliac veins by the ascending lumbar veins and with many of the tributaries of the inferior vena cava. The bronchial veins return the blood from the substance of the lungs ; that of the right side opens into the vena azygos major, near its termination ; that of the left side, into the left superior intercostal vein or left upper azygos vein. The Spinal Veins The numerous venous plexuses placed upon and within the spine may be arranged into four sets. Fig. 389.—Transverse section of a dorsal vertebra, showing the spinal veins. 1. Those placed on the exterior of the spinal column (the dorsi-sjnnal veins). 2. Those situated in the interior of the spinal canal, between the vertebrae and the theca vertebralis {meningo-rachidian veins). 3. The veins of the bodies of the vertebrae {vence basis vertebrarum). 4. The veins of the spinal cord {medulli-spinal). I. The Dorsi-spinal Veins commence by small branches, which receive their blood from the integument of the back of the spine, and from the muscles in the vertebral grooves. They form a complicated network, which surrounds the spinous processes, the laminae, and the transverse and articular processes of all the vertebrae. At the bases of the transverse processes, they communicate, by means of ascending and descending branches, with the veins surrounding the contiguous * For an account of the arrangement of the azygos and superior intercostal veins in a number of consecutive cases from the same dissecting-room, see a paper by Mr. B. G. Morison, Journ. of Anat. and Phys. vol. xiii. p. 346. The most important difference between his description and that in the text is, that he always found two superior intercostal veins on both sides; the vein from the first space being separate, and joining the corresponding innominate vein. The lower (and larger) superior intercostal vein he describes as opening into the azygos on the right, and innominate on the left side.SPINAL 651 vertebrae, and they join with the veins in the spinal canal by branches which perforate the ligamenta subflava. Other branches pass obliquely forwards, between the transverse processes, and communicate with the intraspinal veins through the intervertebral foramina. They terminate by joining the vertebral veins in the neck, the intercostal veins in the thorax, and the lumbar and sacral veins in the loins and pelvis. 2. The Meningo-rachidian Veins.—The principal veins contained in the spinal canal are situated between the theca vertebralis and the vertebrae. They consist of two longitudinal plexuses, one of which runs along the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae (anterior longitudinal spinal veins). The other plexus {posterior longitudinal spinal veins) is placed on the inner or anterior surface of the laminae of the vertebrae. The Anterior Longitudinal Spinal Veins consist of two large, tortuous veins, which extend along the whole length of the vertebral column, from the foramen magnum, where they communicate by a venous ring around that opening, to the base of the coccyx, being placed one on each side of the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, along the margin of the posterior common ligament. These veins communicate together opposite each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large vence, basis vertebrarum from the interior of the body of each vertebra. The anterior longitudinal spinal Fig. 390.—Vertical section of two dorsal vertebrae, showing the spinal veins. veins are least developed in the cervical and sacral regions. They are not of uniform size throughout, being alternately enlarged and constricted. At the intervertebral foramina, they communicate with the dorsi-spinal veins, and with the vertebral veins in the neck, with the intercostal veins in the dorsal region, and with the lumbar and sacral vems in the corresponding regions. The Posterior Longitudinal Spinal Veins, smaller than the anterior, are situated one on each side, between the inner surface of the laminae and the theca vertebralis. They communicate (like the anterior), opposite each vertebra, by transverse trunks ; and with the anterior longitudinal veins, by lateral transverse branches, which pass from behind forwards. These veins, by branches which perforate the ligamenta subflava, join with the dorsi-spinal veins. From them branches are given off, which pass through the intervertebral foramina and join the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral veins. 3. The Veins of the Bodies of the Vertebrae {vcnce, basis' vertebrarum) emerge from the foramina on their posterior surface, and join the transverse trunk connecting the anterior longitudinal spinal veins. They are contained in large, tortuous channels in the substance of the bones, similar in every respect to those found in the diploe of the cranial bones. These canals lie parallel to the upper and lower surface of the bones. They commence by small openings on the front and sides of the bodies of the vertebra, through which communicating branches from the veins external to the bone pass into its substance, and converge to theVEINS 652 principal canal, which is sometimes double towards its posterior part, and open into the corresponding transverse branch uniting the anterior longitudinal veins. They become greatly developed in advanced age. 4. The Veins of the Spinal (^ovdi [medulli-simial) consist of a minute, tortuous, venous plexus which covers the entire surface of the cord, being situated between the pia mater and arachnoid. These vessels emerge chiefly from the median furrows, and are largest in the lumbar region. Near the base of the skull they unite, and form tAvo or three small trunks, which communicate with the vertebral veins, and then terminate in the inferior cerebellar veins, or in the inferior petrosal sinuses. Each of the spinal nerves is accompanied by a branch as far as the intervertebral foramina, where they join the other veins from the spinal canal. There are no valves in the spinal veins. VEINS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS The Veins of the Lower Extremity are subdivided, like those of the upper, into two sets, superficial and deep : the superficial veins being placed beneath the integument, between the two layers of superficial fascia ; the deep veins accom- panying the arteries, and forming the venae comites of those vessels. Both sets of veins are provided with valves, which are more numerous in the deep than in the superficial set. These valves are also more numerous in the lower than in the upper limb. The Superficial Veins of the Lower Extremity are the internal or long saphenous, and the external or short saphenous. On the dorsum of the foot is a venous arch, situated in the superficial structures over the anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones. It has its convexity directed forwards, and receives digital tributaries from the upper surface of the toes ; at its concavity it is joined by numerous small veins, which form a plexus on the dorsum of the foot. The arch terminates internally in the long saphenous, externally in a short saphenous vein. The internal or long saphenous vein (fig. 391) commences at the inner side of the arch on the dorsum of the foot ; it ascends in front of the inner malleolus, and along the inner side of the leg, behind the inner margin of the tibia, accompanied by the internal saphenous nerve. At the knee, it passes backwards behind the inner condyle of the femur, ascends along the inside of the thigh, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, terminates in the femoral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. This vein receives in its course cutaneous tributaries from the leg and thigh, and at the saphenous opening the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, and external pudic veins. The veins from the inner and back part of the thigh frequently unite to form a large vessel, which enters the main trunk near the saphenous opening ; and sometimes those on the outer side of the thigh join to form another large vessel; so that occasionally three large veins are seen converging from different parts of the thigh towards the saphenous opening. The internal saphenous vein communicates in the foot with the internal plantar vein; in the leg, with the posterior tibial veins, by branches which perforate the tibial origin of the Soleus muscle, and also with the anterior tibial veins ; at the knee, with the articular veins ; in the thigh, with the femoral vein by one or more branches. The valves in this vein vary from two to six in number; they are more numerous in the thigh than in the leg. The external or short saphenous vein (fig. 392) commences at the outer side of the arch on the dorsum of the foot; it ascends behind the outer malleolus, and along the outer border of the tendo Achilhs, across which it passes at an acute angle to reach the middle line of the posterior aspect of the leg. Passing directly upwards, it perforates the deep fascia in the lower part of the popliteal space, and terminates in the popliteal vein, between the heads of the Gastro-653 OF THE LOWEE EXTREMITY cnemius muscle.* Fig. 391.—The internal or long saphenous vein and its branches. Fig 392.—External or short saphe- nous vein. It receives numerous large tributaries from the back part of the leg, and communicates with the deep veins on the dorsum of the foot, and behind the outer malleolus. Before it perforates the deep fascia, it gives off a communicating branch, which passes upwards and inwards to join the in- ternal saphenous vein. This vein has a variable number of valves, from three to nine (Gay), one of which is always found near its termination in the pop- liteal vein. The external saphenous nerve lies close beside this vein. Surgical Anatomy.— The saphena veins are of con- siderable surgical import- ance, since a varicose condi- tion of these vessels is more frequently met with than those in other parts of the body, except perhaps the spermatic and heemorrhoidal veins. The course of the in- ternal saphenous is in front of the tip of the malleolus, over the subcutaneous sur- face of the lower end of the tibia, and then along the internal border of this bone, to the back part of the in- ternal condyle of the femur, whence it follows the course of the Sartorius muscle and is represented on the surface by a line drawn from the posterior border of the Sar- torius on a level with the internal condyle to the saph- enous opening. The short saphenous lies behind the external malleolus, and from this follows the middle line of the calf to just below the ham. It is not generally so apparent beneath the skin as the internal saphenous. Both these veins in the leg are accompanied by nerves, the internal saphenous being joined by its companion nerve just below the level of the knee-joint. No doubt much of the pain of varicose veins in the leg is due to this fact. On the Continent the internal saphenous vein as it rests on the tibia just above the malleolus is sometimes selected for venesection. The Deep Veins of the Lower Extremity ac- company the arteries and their branches, and are called the vence comites of those vessels. * Mr. Gay calls attention to the fact that the ex- ternal saphenous vein often (he says invariably) pene- trates the fascia at or about the point where the tendon of the Gastrocnemius commences, and runs below the fascia in the rest of its course, or sometimes among the muscular fibres, to join the popliteal vein. See Gay on Varicose Disease of the Lower Extremities, p. 24, where there is also a careful and elaborate description of the branches of the saphena veins.VEINS 654 The external and internal plantar veins unite to form the posterior tibial. They accomi^any the posterior tibial artery, and are joined by the i^eroneal veins. The anterior tibial veins are formed by a continuation upwards of the venae comites of the dorsalis pedis artery. They pass between the tibia and fibula, through the large oval aperture above the interosseous membrane, and form, by their junction with the posterior tibial, the popliteal vein. The valves in the deep veins are very numerous. The Popliteal Vein is formed by the junction of the venas comites of the anterior and posterior tibial vessels ; it ascends through the popliteal space to the tendinous aperture in the Adductor magnus, where it "becomes the femoral vein. In the lower part of its course, it is placed internal to the artery; between the heads of the Gastrocnemius, it is superficial to that vessel; but above the knee- joint, it is close to its outer side. It receives the sural veins from the Gastro- cnemius muscle, the articular veins, and the external saphenous. The valves in this vein are usually four in number. The Femoral Vein accompanies the femoral artery through the upper two- thirds of the thigh. In the lower part of its course it lies external to the artery ; higher up, it is behind it; and at Poupart's ligament, it lies to its inner side, and on the same plane. It receives numerous muscular tributaries : the profunda femoris and deep external pudic veins join it near Poupart's ligaii^^ent, and about an inch and a half below the internal saphenous vein. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. The External Iliac Vein commences at the termination of the femoral, beneath . the crural arch, and, passing upwards along the brim of the pelvis, terminates opposite the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, by uniting with the internal iliac to form the common iliac vein. On the right side, it lies at first along the inner side of the external iliac artery; but as it passes upwards, gradually inclines behind it. On the left side, it lies altogether on the inner side of the artery. It receives, immediately above Poupart's ligament, the deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac veins and a small pubic vein, corresponding to the pubic branch of the obturator artery. According to Friedreich, it frequently contains one and some- times two valves. The Deep Epigastric Veins.—Two veins accompany the deep epigastric artery ; they usually unite into a single trunk before their termination in the external iliac vein. The Deep Circumflex Iliac Veins—Two veins accompany the deep circumflex iliac artery. These unite into a single trunk which crosses the external iliac artery just above Poupart's ligament, and terminates in the external iliac vein. The Internal Iliac Vein is formed by the venae comites of the branches of the internal iliac artery, the umbilical arteries excepted. It receives the blood from the exterior of the pelvis by the gluteal, sciatic, internal pudic, and obturator veins; and from the organs in the cavity of the pelvis by the haemorrhoidal and vesico-prostatic plexuses in the male, and the uterine and vaginal plexuses in the female. The vessels forming these plexuses are remarkable for their large size, their frequent anastomoses, and the number of valves which they contain. The internal iliac vein lies at first on the inner side, and then behind the internal iliac artery, and terminates opposite the sacro-iliac articulation, by uniting with the external iliac to form the common iliac vein. This vessel has no valves. The internal pudic veins {vencB comites) have the same course as the internal pudic artery. They receive tributaries corresponding to the branches of the artery except the tributary corresponding to the dorsal artery of the penis, that is, the dorsal vein of the penis, which opens into the prostatic plexus. The haemorrhoidal plexus surrounds the lower end of the rectum, being formed by the superior haemorrhoidal veins (tributaries of the inferior mesenteric), and the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal, which terminate in the internal iliac. The portal and general venous systems have a free communication by means of the branches composing this plexus.655 OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY Sitrgical Anatomy.—The veins of this plexus are apt to become dilated and varicose, and form piles. This is partly due to the free communication between the portal and systemic circulation vi^hich here exists, so that any obstruction to the flow of blood through either the inferior vena cava or its main tributaries, or through the portal vein, tends to produce passive congestion of this plexus. The condition is also partly due to the fact that the vessels are contained in ver}^ loose, lax connective tissue, so that they get less support from surrounding structures than most other veins, and are less capable of resisting increased blood pressure. And finally, the condition is favoured by gravitation, inasmuch as the portal vein contains no valves. The vesico-prostatic plexus surrounds the neck and base of the bladder and prostate gland. It communicates with the hssmorrhoidal plexus behind, and receives the dorsal vein of the penis, which enters the pelvis beneath the subpubic ligament. This plexus is supported upon the sides of the bladder by a reflection of the pelvic fascia. The veins composing it are very liable to become varicose, and often contain hard, earthy concretions, called ijlileholitlis. Surgical Anatomy.—This plexus is wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy, and it is through it that septic matter finds its way into the general circulation after this operation. The dorsal vein of the penis is a vessel of large size, which returns the blood from the body of that organ. At first it consists of two branches, which are contained in the groove on the dorsum of the penis, and it receives veins from the gians, the corpus spongiosum, and numerous superficial veins ; these unite near the root of the penis into a single trunk, which passes through the suspensory ligament of the penis, pierces the triangular ligament beneath the pubic arch, and divides into two branches, which enter the prostatic plexus. The vaginal plexus surrounds the mucous membrane, being especially developed at the orifice of the vagina; it communicates with the vesical plexus in front, and with the h^emorrhoidal plexus behind. The uterine plexus is situated along the sides and superior angles of the uterus, between the layers of the broad ligament, receiving large venous canals (the uterine sinuses) from the substance of the uterus. The veins composing this plexus anastomose frequently with each other and with the ovarian veins. They are not tortuous like the arteries. The Common Iliac Veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac veins in front of the sacro-iliac articulation ; passing obliquely upwards towards the right side, they terminate upon the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, w^here the veins of the two sides unite at an acute angle to form the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac is shorter than the left, nearly vertical in its direction, and ascends behind and then to the outer side of its corresponding artery. The left common iliac, longer and more oblique in its course, is at first situated on the inner side of the corresponding artery, and then behind the right common iliac. Each common iliac receives the ilio-lumbar, and sometimes the lateral sacral veins. The left receives, in addition, the middle sacral vein. No valves are found in these veins. The middle sacral veins accompany the corresponding artery along the front of the sacrum, and terminate in the left common iliac vein; occasionally in the angle of junction of the two iliac veins. Peculiarities.—The left common iliac vein, instead of joining with the right in its usual position, occasionally ascends on the left side of the aorta as high as the kidney, where, after receiving the left renal vein, it crosses over the aorta, and then joins with the right vein to form the vena cava. In these cases, the two common iliacs are connected by a small communicating branch at the spot where they are usually united.* The Inferior Vena Cava returns to the heart the blood from all the parts below the Diaphragm. It is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins on the right side of the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. It passes upwards along the front of the spine, on the right side of the * See two cases which have been described by Mr. Walsham in the St. Bartholomew''s Hosjntal Rejports, vols. xvi. and xvii.VEINS 656 aorta, and, having reached the under surface of the Hver, is contained in a groove in its posterior surface. In then perforates the central tendon of the Diaphragm, enters the pericardium, where it is covered by its serous layer, and terminates in the lower and back part of the right auricle. At its termination in the auricle it is provided with a valve, the Eustachian, which is of large size during foetal life. Eelations.—In front, from below upwards, with the mesentery, right spermatic artery, transverse portion of the duodenum, the pancreas, portal vein, and the posterior surface of the liver, which partly and occasionally completely surrounds it; behind, with the vertebral column, the right crus of the Diaphragm, the right renal and lumbar arteries, right semilunar ganglion; on the left side, with the aorta. Tributaries.—It receives in its course the following veins :— Lumbar. Suprarenal. Right Spermatic. Phrenic. Renal. Hepatic. Peculiarities.—In Position.—This vessel is sometimes placed on the left side of the aorta, as high as the left renal veins, after receiving which it crosses over to its usnal position on the right side; or it may be placed altogether on the left side of the aorta, as far upwards as its termination in the heart : in such cases, the abdominal and thoracic viscera, together with the great vessels, are all transposed. Point of Termination.—Occasionally the inferior vena cava joins the right azygos vein, which is then of large size. In such cases, the superior cava receives the whole of the blood from the body before transmitting it to the right auricle, except the blood from the hepatic veins, which passes directly into the right auricle. The lumbar veins, four in number on each side, collect the blood by dorsal tributaries from the muscles and integument of the loins, and by abdominal tribu- taries from the walls of the abdomen, where they communicate with the epigastric veins. At the spine, they receive veins from the spinal plexuses, and then pass forwards, round the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae beneath the. Psoas magnus, and terminate at the back part of the inferior cava. The left lumbar veins are longer than the right, and pass behind the aorta. The lumbar veins are connected together by a longitudinal vein which passes in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and is called the ascending lumbar. It forms the most frequent origin of the corresponding vena azygos, and serves to connect the common iliac, ilio-lumbar, lumbar, and azygos veins of the corresponding side of the body. The spermatic veins emerge from the back of the testis, and receive tributaries from the epididymis; they unite and form a convoluted plexus, called the spermatic plexus {plexus imminniformis), which forms the chief mass of the cord : the vessels composing this plexus are very numerous, and ascend along the cord in front of the vas deferens ; below the external abdominal ring they unite to form three or four veins, which pass along the spermatic canal, and, entering the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring, coalesce to form two veins, which ascend on the Psoas muscle, behind the peritoneum, lying one on each side of the spermatic artery, and unite to form a single vein, which opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle; on the left side into the left renal vein, at a right angle. The spermatic veins are provided with valves.* The left spermatic vein passes behind the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and is thus exposed to pressure from the contents of that bowel. Surgical Anatomy.—The spermatic veins are very frequently varicose, constituting the disease known as varicocele. Though it is quite possible that the originating cause of this affection may be a congenital abnormality either in the size or number of the veins of the pampiniform plexus, still it must be admitted that there are many anatomical * Eivington has pointed out that a valve is usually found at the orifices of both the right and left spermatic veins. When no A^alves exist at the opening of the left spermatic vein into the left renal vein, valves are generally present in the left renal vein within a quarter of an inch from the orifice of the spermatic vein. {Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. vii. p. 163.)657 PORTAL SYSTEM reasons why these vems should become varicose : viz. the imperfect support afforded to them by the loose tissue of the scrotum ; their great length ; their vertical com'se ; their dependent position; their plexiform arrangement in the scrotum, with their termination in one small vein in the abdomen ; their few and imperfect valves ; and the fact that they may be subjected to pressure in their passage through the abdominal wall. The ovarian veins are analogous to the spermatic in the male; they form a plexus near the ovary and in the broad ligament and Fallopian tube, communi- cating with the uterine plexus. They terminate in the same way as the spermatic veins in the male. Valves are occasionally found in these veins. These vessels, like the uterine veins, become much enlarged during pregnancy. The renal veins are of large size, and placed in front of the renal arteries.* The left is longer than the right, and passes in front of the aorta, just below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. It receives the left spermatic, the left inferior phrenic, and, generally, the left suprarenal veins. It opens into the vena cava, a little higher than the right. The suprarenal veins terminate, on the right side, in the vena cava; on the left side, in the left renal or phrenic vein. The phrenic veins follow the course of the phrenic arteries. The tico suioerior, of small size, accompany the phrenic nerve and comes nervi phrenici artery, and join the internal mammary. The tico inferior phrenic veins follow the course of the phrenic arteries, and terminate, the right in the inferior vena cava, the left in the left renal vein. The hepatic veins commence in the substance of the liver, in the capillary terminations of the portal vein and hepatic artery: these tributaries, gradually uniting, usually form three large veins, which converge towards the posterior surface of the liver, and open into the inferior vena cava, w^hilst that vessel is situated in the groove at the back part of this organ. Of these three veins, one from the right, and another from the left lobe, open obliquely into the inferior vena cava ; that from the middle of the organ and lobulus Spigelii having a straight course. The hepatic veins run singly, and are in direct contact with the hepatic tissue. They are destitute of valves. Portal System of Veins The portal venous system is composed of four large veins, which collect the venous blood from the ^iscera of digestion. The trunk formed by their union {vena portce) enters the liver and ramifies throughout its substance; and its branches, again emerging from that organ as the hepatic veins, terminate in the inferior vena cava. The branches in this vein are in all cases single, and destitute of valves. The veins forming the portal system are, the Superior Mesenteric. Inferior Mesenteric. Splenic. Gastric. The superior mesenteric vein returns the blood from the small intestines, and from the caecum and ascending and transverse portions of the colon, corresponding with the distribution of the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. The large trunk formed by the union of these branches ascends along the right side and in front of the corresponding artery, passes in front of the transverse portion of the duodenum, and unites, behind the upper border of the pancreas, ^\iih. the splenic vein to form the vena portae. It receives the right gastro-epiploic vein. The splenic vein commences by five or six large branches, w^hich return the blood from the substance of the spleen. These uniting form a single vessel, which passes from left to right, grooving the upper and back part of the pancreas, below * The student may observe that all veins above the Diaphragm, which do not lie on the same x)lane as the arteries which they accompany, lie in front of them : and that all veins below the Diaphragm, which do not lie on the same plane as the arteries which they accompany, lie behind them, except the renal and profunda femoris vem. u uVEINS 658 the artery, and terminates at its greater end by uniting at a right angle with the superior mesenteric to form the vena ported. The splenic vein is of large size, and not tortuous hke the artery. It receives the vasa brevia from the left extremity of the stomach, the,left gastro-epiploic vein, pancreatic branches from the pancreas, the pancreatico-duodenal vein, and the inferior mesenteric vein. The inferior mesenteric vein returns the blood from the rectum, sigmoid flexure, and descending colon, corresponding with the ramifications of the branches of Fig. 393.—Portal vein and its branches. j^OTE.—In this diagram the rio^ht gastro-epiploic vein opens into the splenic vein; generally it empties itself into the superior mesenteric, close to its termination. the inferior mesenteric artery. Ascending beneath the peritoneum in the lumbar region, it passes behind the transverse portion of the duodenum and pancreas, and termmates in the splenic vein. Its ha^morrhoidal branches inosculate with those of the internal ihac, and thus establish a communication between the portal and the general venous system.* * Besides this anastomosis between the portal vein and the branches of the vena cava, other anastomoses between the portal and systemic veins are formed by the commmiica-CARDIAC 659 The g^astric veins are two in number : one, a small vein, corresponds to the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery ; the other, considerably larger, corresponds to the gastric artery. The former {'pyloric, Walsham) rmis along the. lesser cm^- vatm'e of the stomach towards the pyloric end, receives branches from the pylorus and duodenum, and ends in the vena port^e. The latter {coronary, Walsham) begins near the pylorus, runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach, towards the oesophageal opening, and then curves downwards and backwards between the folds of the lesser omentum to end in the vena portse. The Portal Vein is formed by the junction of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins, their union taking place in front of the vena cava, and behind the upper border of the great end of the pancreas. Passing upwards through the right border of the lesser omentum to the under surface of the liver, it enters the transverse fissure, where it is somewhat enlarged, forming the sinus of the portal vein, and divides into two branches, which accompany the ramifications of the hepatic artery and hepatic duct throughout the substance of the liver. Of these two branches the right is the larger, but the shorter, of the two. The portal vein is about three or four inches in length, and, whilst contained in the lesser omentum, lies behind and between the hepatic duct and artery, the former being to the right, the latter to the left. These structures are accompanied by filaments of the hepatic plexus of nerves, and numerous lymphatics, surrounded by a quantity of loose areolar tissue {capsule of Glisson), and placed between the layers of the lesser omentum. The vena port^e receives the gastric and cystic veins : the latter vein sometimes terminates in the right branch of the vena ports. Within the liver, the portal vein receives the blood from the branches of the hepatic artery. Cardiac Veins The veins which return the blood from the substance of the heart are, the Anterior Cardiac Vein. Right Cardiac Veins. Posterior Cardiac Vein. Right or Small Coronary Sinus. Left Cardiac Veins. Left or Great Coronary Sinus. Vens Thebesii. The Anterior Cardiac Vein (sometimes called Great Cardiac Vein) is a vessel of considerable size, which commences at the apex of the heart, and ascends along the anterior interventricular groove to the base of the ventricles. It then curves to the left side, around the auriculo-ventricular groove, between the left auricle and ventricle, to the back part of the heart, and opens into the great coronary sinus, its aperture being guarded by two valves. It receives, in its course, tributaries from both ventricles, but especially the left, and also from the left auricle ; one of these, ascending along the thick margin of the left ventricle, is of considerable size. The vessels joining it are provided with valves. The Posterior Cardiac Vein commences by small tributaries, at the apex of the heart, jcommunicating with those of the preceding. It ascends along the posterior interventricular groove to the base of the heart, and terminates in the great coronary sinus, its orifice being guarded by a valve. It receives the veins from the posterior surface of both ventricles. The Left Cardiac Veins are three or four small vessels, which collect the blood from the posterior surface of the left ventricle, and open into the lower border of the great coronary sinus. The Right Cardiac Veins are three or four small vessels, which collect the blood from the anterior surface of the right ventricle. One of these (the vein of tion between the gastric veins and the cesophageal veins which empty themselves into the vena azygos minor ; between the left renal vein and the veins of the intestines, especially of the colon and duodenum ; between the veins of the round ligament of the liver and the portal veins ; and between the superficial branches of the portal veins of the livef and the phrenic veins, as pointed out by Mr. Kiernan. (See Pliysiological Anatomy, by Todd and Bowman, 1859, vol. ii. p. 348.) u u 2VEINS 66o Galen), larger than the rest, runs along the right border of the heart. They open separately into the lower part of the right auricle. The Right or Small Coronary Sinus runs along the groove between the right auricle and ventricle, to open into the right extremity of the great coronary sinus. It receives blood from the back part of the right auricle and ventricle. The Left or Great Coronary Sinus is that portion of the anterior cardiac vein which is situated in the posterior part of the left auriculo-ventricular groove. It is about an inch in length, presents a considerable dilatation, and is covered by the muscular fibres of the left auricle. It receives the veins enumerated above, and an oblique vein from the back part of the left auricle, the remnant of the obliterated left innominate trunk of the foetus, described by Mr. Marshall. The great coronary sinus terminates in the right auricle, between the inferior vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular aperture, its orifice being guarded by a semilunar fold of the lining membrane of the heart, the coronary valve. All the veins joining this vessel, excepting the oblique vein above mentioned, are provided with valves. The Vense Thebesii are numerous minute veins, which return the blood directly from the muscular substance, without entering the venous current. They open by minute orifices {foramina Thebesii) on the inner surface of the right auricle.OF THE LYMPHATICS THE Lymphatics have derived their name from the appearance of the fluid contained in their interior {lympha, water). They are also called absorbents, from the property they possess of absorbing certain materials from the tissues and conveying them into the circulation. The lymphatic system includes not only the lymphatic vessels and the glands through which they pass, but also the lacteal or chijliferous vessels. The lacteals are the lymphatic vessels of the small intestine, and differ in no respect from the .lymphatics generally, excepting that they contain a milk-white fluid, the chijle, during the process of digestion, and convey it into the blood through the thoracic duct. The lymphatics are exceedingly delicate vessels, the coats of which are so transparent that the fluid they contain is readily seen through them. They retain a nearly uniform size, being interrupted at intervals by constrictions, which give them a knotted or beaded appearance. These constrictions are due to the presence of valves in their interior. Lymphatics have been found in nearly every texture and organ of the body which contain blood-vessels. Such non-vascular structures as cartilage, the nails, cuticle, and hair have none, but with these exceptions it is probable that eventually all parts will be found to be permeated by these vessels. The lymphatics are arranged into a superficial and deep set. The superficial lymphatics, on the surface of the body, are placed immediately beneath the integu- ment, accompanying the superficial veins; they join the deep lymphatics in certain situations by perforating the deep fascia. In the interior of the body they lie in the submucous areolar tissue, throughout the whole length of the gastro-pulmonary and genito-urinary tracts ; and in the subserous tissue in the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities. The method of their origin has been described along with the other details of their minute anatomy (page 54). Here it will be sufficient to say that a plexiform network of minute lymphatics may be found interspersed among the proper elements and blood-vessels of the several tissues; the vessels composing which, as well as the meshes between them, are much larger than those of the capillary plexus. From these networks small vessels emerge, which pass, either to a neighbouring gland, or to join some larger lymphatic trunk. The deep lymphatics, fewer in number, and larger than the superficial, accompany the deep blood-vessels. Their mode of origin is probably similar to that of the super- ficial vessels. The lymphatics of any part or organ exceed the veins in number, but in size they are much smaller. Their anastomoses also, especially those of the large trunks, are more frequent, and are effected by vessels equal in diameter to those which they connect, the continuous trunks retaining the same diameter. The lymphatic or absorbent glands, named also conglobate glands, are small, solid, glandular bodies, situated in the course of the lymphatic and lacteal vessels. In size they vary from a hemp-seed to an almond, and their colour, on section, is of a pinkish-grey tint, excepting the bronchial glands, which in the adult are mottled with black. Each gland has a layer or capsule of cellular tissue investing it, from which prolongations dip into its substance, forming partitions. The lymphatic and lacteal vessels pass through these bodies in their passage to the thoracic and lymphatic ducts. A lymphatic or lacteal vessel, previous to entering662 LYMPHATICS a gland, divides into several small branches, which are named afferent vessels. As they enter, their external coat becomes continuous with the capsule of the giand, and the vessels, much thinned, and consisting only of their internal or endothelial coat, pass into the gland, and Fig. 394.—The thoracic and right lymphatic duct. Bigh lympli civ t branch out upon and in the tissue of the capsule ; these branches opening into the lymph sinuses of the gland. From these sinuses fine branches proceed to form a plexus, the vessels of which unite to form a single efferent vessel, which, on emerging from the giand, is again invested with an external coat. Further details on the minute anatomy of the lymphatic vessels and glands will be found in the chapter on General Anatomy. Thoracic Duct The thoracic duct (fig. 394) conveys the great mass of the lymph and chyle into the blood. It is the common trunk of all the lymphatic vessels of the body, excepting those of the right side of the head, neck, and thorax, and right upper extremity, the right lung, right side of the heart, and the convex surface of the liver. It varies in length from fifteen to eighteen inches in the adult, and ex- tends from the second lumbar vertebra to the foot of the neck. It commences in the abdomen by a triangular dila- tation, the receiotaculum chyli (reservoir or cistern of Pec- quet), which is situated upon the front of the body of the second lumbar vertebra, to the right side and behind the aorta, by the side of the right crus of the Diaphragm. It as- cends into the thorax through the aortic opening in the Dia- phragm, lying to the right of the aorta, and is placed in the posterior mediastinum in front of the vertebral column, lying between the aorta and vena azygos major. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra, it inchnes towards the left side and ascends behind the arch of the aorta, on the left side of the oesophagus, and behind the first portion of the left subclavian artery to the663 OF THE HEAD, FACE, AND NECK upper orifice of the thorax. Opposite the seventh cervical vertebra, it turns outwards, and then curves downwards over the subclavian artery, and in front of the Scalenus anticus muscle, so as to form an arch ; and terminates in the left subclavian vein, at its angle of junction with the left internal jugular vein. The thoracic duct, at its commencement, is about equal in size to the diameter of a goose-quill, diminishes considerably in its calibre in the middle of the thorax, and is again dilated just before its termination. It is generally flexuous in its course, and constricted at intervals so as to present a varicose appearance. The thoracic duct not unfrequently divides in the middle of its course into two branches of unequal size, which soon reunite, or into several branches which form a plexiform interlacement. It occasionally divides, at its upper part, into two branches, of which the one on the left side terminates in the usual manner, while that on the right opens into the right subclavian vein, in connection with the right lymphatic duct. The thoracic duct has numerous valves throughout its whole course, but they are more numerous in the upper than in the lower part: at its termination it is provided with a pair of valves, the free borders of which are turned towards the vein, so as to prevent the passage of venous blood into the duct. Tributaries.—^The thoracic duct, at its commencement, receives four or five large trunks from the abdominal lymphatic glands, and also the trunk of the lacteal vessels. Within the thorax, it is joined by the lymphatic vessels from the left half of the wall of the thoracic cavity, the lymphatics from the sternal and intercostal glands, those of the left lung, left side of the heart, trachea, and oesophagus ; and, just before its termination, it receives the lymphatics of the left side of the head and neck, and left u^^per extremity. Structure (fig. 61).—The thoracic duct is composed of three coats, which differ in some respects from those of the lymphatic vessels. The internal coat consists of a single layer of flattened lanceolate-shaped endothelial cells, with serrated borders ; of a subendothelial layer similar to that found in the arteries ; and an elastic fibrous coat, the fibres of which run in a longitudinal direction. The middle coat consists of a longitudinal layer of white connective tissue with elastic fibres, external to which are several lamina of muscular tissue, the fibres of which are for the most part disposed transversely, but some are oblique or longitudinal, and intermixed with elastic fibres. The external coat is composed of areolar tissue, with elastic fibres and isolated fasciculi of muscular fibres. The Right Lymphatic Duct is a short trunk, about half an inch in length, and a line or a line and a half in diameter. It terminates in the right subclavian vein, at its angle of junction with the right internal jugular vein. Its orifice is guarded by two semilunar valves, which prevent the passage of venous blood into the duct. Tributaries.—It receives the lymph from the right side of the head and neck, the right upper extremity, the right side of the thorax, the right lung and right side of the heart, and from part of the convex surface of the liver. Lymphatics of the Head, Face, and Neck The Lymphatic Glands of the Head (fig. 395) are of small size, few in number, and confined to its posterior region. They are the occijntal, and posterior auricular. The occijyital set are placed at the back of the head along the attach- ment of the Occipito-frontalis muscle. The j^osterior auricular set are placed near the upper end of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. Both these sets of glands are affected in cutaneous eruptions and other diseases of the scalp. In the face, the superficial lymphatic glands are more numerous : they are the ijarotid, some of which are superficial and others deeply placed in the substance of the parotid gland ; the zygomatic, situated under the zygoma ; the buccal, on the surface of the Buccinator muscle ; and the interiial maxiilary, the largest, beneath the ramus of the lower jaw. The lymphatic vessels of the scalp are divided into an anterior and ijosterior set, which follow the course of the temporal and occipital vessels. The temporal664 LYMPHATICS set accompany the temporal artery in front of the ear, to the parotid lymphatic glands, from which they proceed to the lymphatic glands of the neck. The occipital set follow the com^se of the occipital artery, descend to the occipital and posterior auricular lymphatic glands, and from thence join the cervical glands. The Lymphatic Vessels of the Face are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the face are more numerous than those of the head, and commence over its entire surface. Those from the frontal region accompany the frontal vessels ; they then pass obliquely across the face, running Fig. 395.—The superficial lymphatics and glands of the head, face, and neck. with the facial vein, pass through the buccal glands on the surface of the Bucci- nator muscle, and join the submaxillary lymphatic glands. The latter receive the lymphatic vessels from the lips, and are often found enlarged in cases of malignant disease of those parts. The deep lymphatic vessels of the face are derived from the pituitary membrane of the nose, the mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the contents of the temporal and orbital fossae ; they accompany the branches of the internal maxillary artery, and terminate m the internal maxillary and cervical lymphatic glands. The lymphatic vessels of the cranium consist of two sets, the meningeal and cerebral. The meningeal lijmpliatics accompany the meningeal vessels, escape through foramina at the base of the skull, and join the deep cervical lymphatic665 OF THE NECK glands. The cerebral lymphatics are described by Eshmann as being situated between the arachnoid and pia mater, as well as in the choroid i^lexuses of the lateral ventricles; they accompany the trunks of the carotid and vertebral arteries, and probably pass through foramina at the base of the skull, to terminate in the deep cervical glands. They have not at present been demonstrated in the dura mater, or in the substance of the brain. The Lymphatic Glands of the Neck are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial cervical glands may be arranged in three sets:—(i) The Fig. 396.—The deep lymphatics and glands of the neck and thorax. suhfnaxillary, ten to fifteen in number, situated beneath the body of the lower jawin'^the submaxillary triangle ; (2) suprahyoid, situated in the middle line of the neck, between the anterior bellies of the two digastric muscles ; and (3) cervical, placed in the course of the external jugular vein between the Platysma and deep fascia. They are most numerous at the root of the neck, in the triangular interval between the clavicle, the Sterno-mastoid, and the Trapezius, where they are continuous with the axillary glands. A few small glands are also found on the front and sides of the larynx. The deep cervical glands (fig. 396) are numerous and of large size ; they form a chain along the sheath of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, lying byLYMPHATICS 666 the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extending from the base of the skull to the thorax, where they communicate with the lymphatic glands in that cavity. They are subdivided into two sets : an upper, ten to twenty in number, situated about the bifurcation of the common carotid and along the upper part of the internal jugular vein ; and a lower, ten to fifteen in number, clustered around the lower part of the internal jugular vein, and extending outwards into the supra- clavicular fossa, where they are continuous with the axillary glands. Internally, this set is continuous with the mediastinal glands. The superficial and deep cervical lymphatic vessels are a continuation of those already described on the cranium and face. After traversing the glands in those regions, they pass through the chain of glands which lie along the sheath of the carotid vessels, being joined by the lymphatics from the pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. At the lower part of the neck, after receiving- some lymphatics from the thorax, they unite into a single trunk, which terminates, on the left side, in the thoracic duct ; on the right side, in the right lymphatic duct. Surgical Anatomy.— The cervical glands are very frequently the seat of tuberculous trouble. This condition is most usually set up by some lesion in those parts from which they receive their lymph. This excites some inflammation, which subsequently^ takes on a tuberculous character. It is very desirable therefore for the surgeon, in dealing with these cases, to possess a knowledge of the relation of the respective groups of glands to the periphery. The following table is extracted from Mr. Treves's work on ' Scrofula and its Gland Diseases.' Seal]}.—Posterior part = suboccipital and mastoid glands.

Seme lymphatic vessels from posterior part of the fossee enter the parotid glands. Lymphatics of the Upper Exteemity The Lymphatic Glands of the Upper Extremity (fig. 397) are divided into two sets, superficial and The superficial lymphatic glands are few and of small size. There are occa- sionally two or three in front of the elbow, and one or two above the internal condyle of the humerus, near the basilic vein. The deep lymphatic glands are few in number and are subdivided into those in the forearm, the arm, and the axilla. In the forearm, a few small ones are occasionally found in the course of the radial and ulnar vessels. In the arm, there is a chain of small glands along the inner side of the brachial artery. One, sometimes two, fairly constant glands are situated a little above and in front of the inner condyle of the humerus. In the axilla they are of large size, and usually ten or twelve in number. A chain of these glands surrounds the axillary vessels, embedded in a quantity of loose areolar tissue ; they receive the lymphatic vessels from the arm ; others are dispersed in the areolar tissue of the axilla : the remainder are arranged in two series, a small chain running along the lower border of the Pectoralis major, receiving the lymphatics from the front of the chest and mamma; and others are placed along the lower margin of the posterior wall of the axilla, which receive the lymphatics from the integument of the back. Two or three subclavian lymphatic glands are placed immediately beneath theOF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 667 clavicle ; it is through these that the axillary and deep cervical glands communicate with each other. Surgical Anatomy.—In malignant diseases, tumours, or other affections implicating the upper part of the back and shoulder, the front of the chest and mamma, the upper part of the front and side of the abdomen, or the hand, forearm, and arm, the axillary glands are Jiable to be found enlarged. The lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity are divided into two sets, super- ficial and deei). Fig. 3^- 397-—Tiie superficial lymphatics and glands of the upper extremity. Axillary glands The superficial lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity commence on the fingers ; two vessels running along either side of each finger, one on the palmar and the other on the dorsal surface. Those on the palmar surface form an arch in the palm of the hand, from which are derived two sets of vessels, which pass up the forearm, taking the course of the subcutaneous veins. The lymphatics from the dorsal surface of the fingers form a plexus on the back of the hand, and, winding around the inner and outer borders of the forearm, unite with those in front. Those from the inner border of the hand accompany the ulnar veins along the inner side668 LYMPHATICS of the forearm to the bend of the elbow, where they are jomed by some lymphatics from the outer side of the forearm; they then follow the com-se of the basihc vein, communicate with the glands immediately above the elbow, and terminate in the axillary glands, joining with the deep lymphatics. The superficial lymphatics from the outer and back part of the hand accompany the radial veins to the bend of the elbow. They are less numerous than the preceding. At the bend of the elbow, the greater number join the basihc group ; the rest ascend with the cephalic vein on the outer side of the arm, some crossing the upper part of the Biceps obliquely, to terminate in the axillary glands, whilst one or two accompany the cephalic vein in the cellular interval between the Pectoralis major and Deltoid, and enter the subclavian lymphatic glands. The deep lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity accompany the deep blood- vessels. In the forearm they consist of four sets, corresponding with the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries ; they pass through the glands occasionally found hi the course of those vessels, and communicate at intervals with the superficial lymphatics. In their course upwards, some of them pass through the glands which lie upon the brachial artery; they then enter the axillary and subclavian glands, and at the root of the neck terminate, on the left side, in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics of the Lower Extremity The Lymphatic Glands of the Lower Extremity are divided into two sets, suioer- ficial and deep. The superficial are confined to the inguinal region, forming the siiioerficial inguinal lymphatic glands. The superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups : an upper oblique set, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament, which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietes of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions, and the mucous membrane of the urethra; and an inferior vertical set, which surround the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, a few being sometimes continued along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. This latter group receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. Surgical Anatomy.—These glands frequently become enlarged in diseases implicating the parts from which their lymphatics originate. Thus in malignant or syphilitic affec- tions of the prepuce and penis, or of the labia majora in the female, in cancer scroti, in abscess in the perinsemn, or in any other diseases affecting the integument and superficial structures in those parts, or the subumbilical part of the abdominal wall, or the gluteal region, the upper chain of glands is almost invariably enlarged, the lower chain being implicated in diseases affecting the lower limb. The deep lymphatic glands are, the anterior tibial, popliteal, deep inguinal, gluteal, and ischiatic. The anterior tibial gland is not constant in its existence. It is generally found by the side of the anterior tibial artery, upon the interosseous membrane at the upper part of the leg. Occasionally, two glands are found in this situation. The popliteal glands, four or five in number, are of small size ; they surround the popliteal vessels, embedded in the cellular tissue and fat of the popliteal space. The deep inguinal glands are placed beneath the deep fascia around the femoral artery and vein. They are of small size, and communicate with the superficial inguinal glands through the saphenous opening. The gluteal and ischiatic glands are placed, the former above, the latter below, the Pyriformis muscle, resting on their corresponding vessels as they pass through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The Lymphatic Vessels of the Lower Extremity, like the veins, may be divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatic vessels are placed beneath the integument in theOF THE LOWER EXTREMITY 669 superficial fascia, and are divisible into two groups : an internal group, which follow the course of the internal saphenous vein; and an external group, which accompany the external saphenous. The internal group, the larger, commence on the inner side and dorsum of the foot- they pass, some in front, and some behind the inner ankle, run up the leg with the internal saphenous vein, pass with it behind the inner condyle of the femur, and accompany it to the groin, where they terminate in the group of super- ficial inguinal lymphatic glands which surround the saphenous opening. Some of the efferent vessels from these glands pierce the cribriform fascia and sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminate in a lymphatic gland contained in the femoral canal, thus establishing a com- munication between the lymphatics of the lower extremity and those of the trunk ; others pierce the fascia lata, and join the deep inguinal glands. The ex- ternal group arise from the outer side of the foot, ascend in front of the leg, and, just below the knee, cross the tibia from without inwards, to join the lym- phatics on the inner side of the thigh. Others commence on the outer side of the foot, pass behind the outer malle- olus, and accompany the external sa- phenous vein along the back of the leg, where they enter the popliteal glands. The deep lymphatic vessels of the lower extremity are few in number, and accompany the deep blood-vessels. In the leg, they consist of three sets, the anterior tibial, peroneal, and pos- terior tibial,- which accompany the corresponding blood-vessels, two or three to each artery ; they ascend with the blood-vessels, and enter the lym- phatic glands in the popliteal space ; the efferent vessels from these glands accompany the femoral vein, and join the deep inguinal glands ; from these, the vessels pass beneath Poupart's ligament, and communicate with the chain of glands surrounding the ex- ternal iliac vessels. The deep lymphatic vessels of the gluteal and ischiatic regions follow the course of the blood-vessels, and join the gluteal and ischiatic glands at the great sacro-sciatic foramen. Fig. 398.—The superficial lymphatics and glands of the lower extremity.LYMPHATICS 670 Lymphatics of the Pelvis and Abdomen The Lymphatic Glands in the Pelvis are, the external iliac, the internal iliac, and the sacral. Those of the abdomen are the lumbar glands. The external iliac glands form an uninterrupted chain round the external iliac vessels, three being placed round the commencement of the vessels just behind the Fig. 399.—The deep lymphatic vessels and glands of the abdomen and pelvis. crural arch. They communicate below with the deep inguinal lymphatic glands, and above with the lumbar glands. The internal iliac glands surround the internal iliac vessels ; they receive the lymphatic vessels corresponding to the branches of the internal iliac artery, and communicate with the lumbar glands. The sacral glands occupy the sides of the anterior surface of the sacrum, some671 OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS being situated in the meso-rectal fold. These and the internal iliac glands are affected in malignant disease of the bladder, rectum, or uterus. The lumbar glands are very numerous ; they are situated on the front of the lumbar vertebra, surrounding the common iliac vessels, the aorta, and vena cava ; they receive the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremities and pelvis, as well as from the testes and some of the abdominal viscera ; the efferent vessels from these glands unite into a few large trunks, which, with the lacteals, form the commence- ment of the thoracic duct. In addition to these there are a few small lateral lumbar glands, which lie between the transverse processes of the vertebrae, behind the Psoas muscle, and receive lymphatics from the back. In some cases of malig- nant disease these glands become enormously enlarged, completely surrounding the aorta and vena cava, and occasionally greatly contracting the calibre of those vessels. In all cases of malignant disease of the testis, and in malignant disease of the lower limb, before any operation is attempted, careful examination of the abdomen should be made, in order to ascertain if any enlargement exists ; and if any should be detected, all operative measures should be avoided as fruitless. The Lymphatic Vessels of the Abdomen and Pelvis may be divided into two sets, superficial and deep. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the walls of the abdomen and pelvis follow the course of the superficial blood-vessels. Those derived from the integument of the lower part of the abdomen below the umbilicus follow the course of the superficial epigastric vessels and converge to the superior group of the superficial inguinal glands ; a deeper set accompany the deep epigastric vessels, and communicate with the external iliac glands. The superficial lymphatics from the sides of the lumbar part of the abdominal w^all wind round the crest of the ilium, accompanying the superficial circumflex iliac vessels, to join the superior group of the superficial inguinal glands ; the greater number, however, run backwards along with the ilio-lumbar and lumbar vessels, to join the lateral lumbar glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the gluteal region turn horizontally round the outer side of the nates, and join the superficial inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the scrotum and perinseum follow the course of the external pudic vessels, and terminate in the superficial inguinal glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the penis occupy the sides and dorsum of the organ, the latter receiving the lymphatics from the skin covering the glans penis ; they all converge to the upper chain of the superficial inguinal glands. The deep lympnatic vessels of the penis follow the course of the internal pudic vessels, and join the internal iliac glands. In the female, the lymphatic vessels of the mucous membrane of the labia, nymphae, and clitoris terminate in the upper chain of the inguinal glands. The deep lymphatic vessels of the abdomen and pelvis take the course of the principal blood-vessels. Those of the parietes of the pelvis, which accompany the gluteal, ischiatic, and obturator vessels, follow the coarse of the internal iliac artery, and ultimately join the lumbar lymphatics. The efferent vessels from the inguinal glands enter the pelvis beneath Poupart's ligament, where they lie in close relation wdth the femoral vein ; they then pass through the chain of glands surrounding the external iliac vessels, and finally terminate in the lumbar glands. They receive the deep epigastric and circumflex iliac lymphatics. The lymphatic vessels of the bladder arise from the entire surface of the organ ; * the greater number run beneath the peritoneum on its posterior surface, and, after passing through the lymphatic glands in that situation, join with the lymphatics from the prostate and vesiculse seminales, and enter the internal iliac glands. The lymphatic vessels of the rectum are of large size ; after passing through * Curnow states that they are confined to the base of the organ.LYMPHATICS 672 some small glands that lie upon its outer wall and in the meso-rectum, they pass to the sacral glands. The lymphatic vessels of the uterus consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; the former being placed beneath the peritoneum, the latter in the substance of the organ. The lymphatics of the cervix uteri, together with those from the vagina, enter the internal iliac and sacral glands ; those from the body and fundus of the uterus pass outwards in the broad ligaments, and, being joined by the lymphatics from the ovaries, broad ligaments, and Fallopian tubes, ascend with the ovarian vessels to open into the lumbar glands. In the uninipregnated uterus they are small; but during gestation they become very greatly enlarged. The lymphatic vessels of the testicle consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; the former commence on the surface of the tunica vaginalis, the latter in the epididymis and body of the testis. They form several large trunks, which ascend with the spermatic cord, and, accompanying the spermatic vessels into the abdomen, terminate into the lumbar glands; hence the enlargement of these glands in malignant disease of the testis. The lymphatic vessels of the kidney arise on the surface, and also in the interior of the organ ; they join at the hilum, and, after receiving the lymphatic vessels from the ureter and suprarenal capsules, open into the lumbar glands. The lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into two sets, superficial and deep. The former arise in the subperitoneal areolar tissue over the entire surface of the organ. Those on the convex surface may be divided into four groups :—i. Those which pass from behind forwards, consisting of three or four branches, which ascend in the longitudinal ligament, and unite to form a single trunk, which passes up between the fibres of the Diaphragm, behind the ensiform cartilage, to enter the anterior mediastinal glands, and finally ascends to the root of the neck, to terminate in the right lymphatic duct. 2. Another group, which also incline from behind forwards, are reflected over the anterior margin of the liver, to its under surface, and from thence pass along the longitudinal fissure to the glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum. 3. A third group incline outwards to the right lateral ligament, and, uniting into one or two large trunks, pierce the Diaphragm, and run along its upper surface to enter the anterior mediastinal glands; or, instead of entering the thorax, turn inwards across the crus of the Diaphragm, and open into the commencement of the thoracic duct. 4. The fourth group incline outwards from the surface of the left lobe of the liver to the left lateral ligament, pierce the Diaphragm, and, passing forwards, terminate in the glands in the anterior mediastinum. The superficial lyuiphatics on the tmder surface of the liver are divided into three sets :—i. Those on the right side of the gall-bladder enter the lumbar glands. 2. Those surrounding the gall-bladder form a remarkable plexus ; they accompany the hepatic vessels, and open into the glands in the gastro-hepatic omentum. 3. Those on the left of the gall-bladder pass to the oesophageal glands, and to the glands which are situated along the lesser curvature of the stomach. The deep lympihatics accompany the branches of the portal vein and the hepatic artery and duct through the substance of the liver ; passing out at the transverse fissure, they enter the lymphatic glands along the lesser curvature of the stomach and behind the pancreas, or join with one of the lacteal vessels previous to its termination in the thoracic duct. The lymphatic glands of the stomach are of small size ; they are placed along the lesser and greater curvatures, some within the gastro-splenic omentum, whilst others surround the cardiac and pyloric orifices. The lymphatic vessels of the stomach consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; the former originating in the subserous, and the latter in the submucous coat. They follow the course of the blood-vessels, and may consequently be arranged into three groups. The first group accompany the gastric vessels along the lesser curvature, receiving branches from both surfaces of the organ, and pass to the glands around the pylorus. The second group pass from the great end of the673 OF THE THORAX stomach, accompanying the vasa brevia, and enter the splenic lymphatic glands. The third group run along the greater curvature with the right gastro-epiploic vessels, and terminate at the root of the mesentery in one of the principal lacteal vessels. The lymphatic glands of the spleen occupy the hilum. Its lymphatic vessels consist of two sets, superficial and deep ; the former are placed beneath its peritoneal covering, the latter in the substance of the organ ; they accompany the blood-vessels, passing through a series of small glands, and, after receiving the lymphatics from the pancreas, ultimately pass into the thoracic duct. The Lymphatic System of the Intestines The lymphatic glands of the small intestine are placed between the layers of the mesentery, occupying the meshes formed by the superior mesenteric vessels, and hence called mesenteric glands. They vary in number from a hundred to a hundred and fifty; and in size, from that of a pea to that of a small almond. These glands are most numerous, and largest above, near the duodenum, and below, opposite the termination of the ileum in the colon. This latter group becomes enlarged and infiltrated with deposit in cases of fever accompanied with ulceration of the intestines. The lymphatic glands of the large intestine are much less numerous than the mesenteric glands ; they are situated along the vascular arches formed by the arteries previous to their distribution, and even sometimes upon the intestine itself. They are fewest in number along the transverse colon, where they form an uninterrupted chain with the mesenteric glands. The lymphatic vessels of the small intestine are called lacteals from the milk-white fluid they usually contain ; they consist of two sets, superficial and deep : the former lie between the layers of the muscular coat and between the muscular and peritoneal coats, taking a longitudinal course along the outer side of the intestine ; the latter occupy the submucous tissue, and course transversely round the intestine, accompanied by the branches of the mesenteric vessels; they pass between the layers of the mesentery, enter the mesenteric glands, and finally unite to form two or three large trunks which terminate in the thoracic duct. The lymphatic vessels of the large intestine consist of two sets : those of the caecum, ascending and transverse colon, which, after passing through their proper glands, enter the mesenteric glands; and those of the descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum, which pass to the lumbar glands. The Lymphatics of the Thokax The Lymphatic Glands of the Thoracic Wall are, the intercostal, internal mammary, anterior mediastinal, and posterior mediastinal. The intercostal glands are small, irregular in number, and situated on each side of the spine, near the costo-vertebral articulations, some being placed between the two planes of intercostal muscles. The internal mammary glands are placed at the anterior extremity of each intercostal space, by the side of the internal mammary vessels. The anterior mediastinal glands are placed in the loose areolar tissue of the anterior mediastinum, some lying upon the Diaphragm in front of the pericardium, and others round the great vessels at the base of the heart. The posterior mediastinal glands are situated in the areolar tissue in the posterior mediastinum, forming a continuous chain by the side of the aorta and oesophagus ; they communicate on each side with the intercostal, below with the lumbar, and above with the deep cervical glands. The Superficial Lymphatic Vessels of the Front of the Thorax run across the great Pectoral muscle, and those on the back part of this cavity lie upon the Trapezius and Latissimus dorsi; they all converge to the axillary glands. The X X674 LYMPHATICS lymphatics from the greater part of the mammary gland pass outwards to the lower border of the PectoraUs major muscle, where they enter a chain of small glands, situated in the axillary space along the lower border of its anterior boundary. Some few lymphatics from the inner side of the mammary gland pass through the intercostal spaces to reach the anterior mediastinal glands. The Deep Lymphatic Vessels of the Thoracic Wall are, the intercostal, internal mammary, and diaphragmatic. The intercostal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the intercostal vessels, receiving lymphatics from the intercostal muscles and pleura ; they pass backwards to the spine, and unite with lymphatics from the back part of the thorax and spinal canal. After traversing the intercostal glands, they pass down the spine, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The internal mammary lymphatic vessels follow the course of the internal mammary vessels; they commence in the muscles of the abdomen above the umbiUcus, communicating with the epigastric lymphatics, ascend between the fibres of the Diaphragm at its attachment to the ensiform appendix, and in their course behind the costal cartilages are joined by the intercostal lymphatics; they terminate on the right side in the right lymphatic duct, on the left side in the thoracic duct. The lymphatic vessels of the Diaphragm follow the course of their corresponding vessels, and terminate, some in front in the anterior mediastinal and internal mam- mary glands, some behind in the intercostal and posterior mediastinal lymphatics. The Lymphatic Glands of the Viscera are the bronchial glands. The bronchial glands are situated round the bifurcation of the trachea and roots of the lungs. They are ten or twelve in number, the largest being placed opposite the bifurcation of the trachea, the smallest round the bronchi and their primary divisions for some little distance within the substance of the lungs. In infancy they present the same appearance as lymphatic glands in other situations ; in the adult they assume a brownish tinge, and in old age a deep black colour. Occasionally, they become sufficiently enlarged to compress and narrow the canal of the bronchi ; and they are often the seat of tubercle or cretaceous deposits. The lymphatic vessels of the lung consist of two sets, superficial and deep : the former are placed beneath the pleura, forming a minute plexus, which covers the outer surface of the lung ; the latter accompany the blood-vessels, and run along the bronchi: they both terminate at the root of the lungs in the bronchial glands. The efferent vessels from these glands, two or three in number, ascend upon the trachea to the root of the neck, traverse the tracheal and oesophageal glands, and terminate on the left side in the thoracic duct, and on the right side in the right lymphatic duct. The cardiac lymphatic vessels consist of two sets, superficial and deep : the former arise in the subserous areolar tissue of the surface, and the latter in the deeper tissues of the heart. They follow the course of the coronary vessels : those of the right side unite into a trunk at the root of the aorta, which, ascending across the arch of that vessel, passes backwards to the trachea, upon which it ascends, to terminate at the root of the neck in thej-ight lymphatic duct. Those of the left side unite into a single vessel at the base of the heart, which, passing along the pulmonary artery, and, traversing some glands at the root of the aorta, ascends on the trachea to terminate in the thoracic duct. The thymic lymphatic vessels arise from the under surface of the thymus gland, and terminate on each side in the internal jugular veins. The thyroid lymphatic vessels arise from either lateral lobe of this organ ; they converge to form a short trunk, which terminates on the right side in the right lymphatic duct, on the left side in the thoracic duct. The lymphatic vessels of the oesophagus form a plexus round that tube, traverse the glands in the posterior mediastinum, and, after communicating with the pulmonary lymphatic vessels near the roots of the lungs, terminate in the thoracic duct.NEEVOUS SYSTEM npHE Nervous System is composed : i. Of a series of large centres of nerve-matter, X called, collectively, the cerehro-spinal centre or axis. 2. Of smaller centres, termed ganglia. 3. Of nerves, connected either with the cerebro-spinal axis or the ganglia. And 4. Of certain modifications of the peripheral terminations of the nerves, forming the organs of the external senses. The Cerebro-spinal Centre consists of two parts, the spinal cord and the encephalon: the latter may be subdivided into the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. THE SPINAL COED AND ITS MEMBKANES Dissection.—To dissect the cord and its membranes, it will be necessary to lay open the whole length of the spinal canal. For this purpose, the muscles must be separated from the vertebral grooves, so as to expose the spinous processes and laminae of the vertebrae ; and the latter must be sawn through on each side, close to the roots of the transverse processes, from the third or fourth cervical vertebra above, to the sacrum below. The vertebral arches having been displaced by means of a chisel, and the separate fragments removed, the dma mater will be exposed, covered by a plexus of veins and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, often infiltrated with serous fluid. The arches of the upper vertebrae are best divided by means of a strong pair of cutting bone-forceps. Membranes of the Coed The membranes which envelope the spinal cord are three in number. The most external is the dura mater, a strong fibrous membrane, which forms a loose sheath around the cord. The most internal is the pia mater, a cellulo-vascular membrane which closely invests the entire surface of the cord. Between the two is the arachnoid membrane, a non-vascular membrane, which envelopes the cord, and is connected to the pia mater by slender filaments of connective tissue. The Dura Mater of the cord, continuous with that which invests the brain, is a loose sheath which surrounds the cord, and is separated from the bony walls of the spinal canal by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, and a plexus of veins. It is attached to the circumference of the foramen magnum, and to the posterior common ligament, especially at the lower end of the spinal canal, by fibrous slips ; and extends below as far as the third piece of the sacrum ; but beyond this point it is impervious, being continued in the form of a slender cord to the back of the coccyx, where it blends with the periosteum. This sheath is much larger than is necessary for its contents, and its size is efreater in the cervical and lumbar regions than in the dorsal. Its inner surface is smooth. On each side may be seen the double openings which transmit the two roots of the corresponding spinal nerve, the fibrous layer of the dura mater being continued in the form of a tubular prolongation on them as they pass through these apertures. These prolongations of the dura mater are short in the upper part of the spine, but become gradually longer below, forming a number of tubes of fibrous membrane, which enclose the sacral nerves, and are contained in the spinal canal. The chief peculiarities of the dura mater of the cord, as compared with that investing the brain, are the following :— X X 2676 NERVOUS SYSTEM Fio. 400.—The spinal cord and its membranes. Vara -JfaU The dura mater of the cord is not adherent to the bones of the spinal canal, which have an independent periosteum. It does not send partitions into the fissures of the cord, as in the brain. Its fibrous laminae do not separate, to form venous sinuses, as in the brain. Structure.—The dura mater consists of white fibrous and elastic tissue, arranged in bands or lamellae, which, for the most part, are parallel Avith one another. Its internal surface is covered by a layer of endothelial cells, which gives this surface its smooth appearance. It is sparingly supplied with vessels; and some few nerves have been traced into it. The Arachnoid is exposed by slitting up the dura mater, and reflecting that membrane to either side (fig. 400). It is a thin, delicate, tubular mem- brane, Avhich invests the surface of the cord, and is connected to the pia mater by slender filaments of connective tissue. Above, it is continuous with the cerebral arachnoid; on each side it is con- tinued on the various nerves, so as to form a sheath for them as they pass outwards to the inter- vertebral foramina. The outer surface of the arachnoid is in contact with the inner surface of the dura mater, and the two are, here and there, connected together by isolated connective-tissue trabecule, especially on the posterior surface of the cord. For the most part, however, the membranes are not connected together, and the interval between them is named the subdural space. The inner surface of the arachnoid is separated from the pia mater by a considerable interval, which is called the suharachnoidean space. The space is largest at the lower part of the spinal canal, and encloses the mass of nerves which form the cauda equina. Superiorly it is continuous with the cranial subarachnoid space, and commu- nicates witii the general ventricular cavity of the brain, by means of an opening in the pia mater, at the inferior boundary of the fourth ventricle (foramen of Majendie). It contains an abundant serous secretion, the cerehro-sinnal fluid. This secretion is sufficient in amount to expand the arachnoid membrane, so as to completely fill up the whole of the space included in the dura mater. The suh- arachnoidean space is occupied by trabeculae of delicate connective tissue, con- necting the pia mater on the one hand with the arachnoid membrane on the other. This is named subarachnoid tissue. In addition to this it is partially subdivided by a longitudinal membranous partition, which serves to connect the arachnoid with the pia mater, opposite the posterior median fissure. This partition is incomplete, and cribriform in structure, consisting of bundles of white fibrous tissue, inter- lacing with each other. This space is to be regarded as, in reality, a great lymph- space, from which the lymph carried to it by the perivascular lymph-sheaths (see page 55) is conveyed back into the circulation. Structure.—The arachnoid is a delicate membrane, made up of closely arranged interlacing bundles of connective tissue in several layers. The Pia Mater of the cord is exposed on the removal of the arachnoid (fig. 400). Fig. 401.—Transverse section of the spinal cord and its membranes.677 SPINAL CORD It covers the entire surface of the cord, to which it is very intimately adherent, forming its neurilemma, and sending a process downwards into its anterior fissure. It also forms a sheath for each of the filaments of the spinal nerves, and invests the nerves themselves. A longitudinal fibrous band extends along the middle line on its anterior surface, called by Haller the linea splendens ; and a somewhat similar band, the ligamentum denticulatum, is situated on each side. At the point where the cord terminates, the pia mater becomes contracted, and is continued down as a long, slender filament {filum termmale), which descends through the centre of the mass of nerves forming the cauda equina, and is blended with the impervious sheath of dura mater, on a level with the third sacral vertebra. It assists in maintaining the cord in its position during the movements of the trunk, and is from this circumstance called the central ligament of the spinal cord. It contains a little grey nervous substance, which may be traced for some distance into its upper part, and is accompanied by a small artery and vein. At the upper part of the cord, the pia mater presents a greyish, mottled tint, which is owing to yellow or brown pigment-cells scattered among the elastic fibres. Structure.—The pia mater of the cord is less vascular in structure, but thicker and denser, than the pia mater of the brain, with which it is continuous. It consists of two layers: an outer composed of bundles of connective-tissue fibres, arranged for the most part longitudinally ; and an inner consisting of stiff bundles of the same tissue, which present peculiar angular bends, and is covered on both surfaces by a layer of endothelium. Between the two layers are a number of cleft- like lymphatic spaces, which communicate with the subarachnoid cavity, and a number of blood-vessels, which are enclosed in a perivascular sheath, derived from the inner layer of the pia mater, into which the lymphatic spaces open. It is also supplied with nerves, which are derived from the sympathetic. The Ligamentum Denticulatum (fig. 400) is a narrow fibrous band, situated on each side of the spinal cord, throughout its entire length, and separating the anterior from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. It has received its name from the serrated appearance which it presents. Its inner border is continuous with the pia mater, at the side of the cord. Its outer border presents a series of triangular, dentated serrations, the points of which are fixed at intervals to the dura mater. These serrations are twenty-one in number, on each side, the first being attached to the dura mater, opposite the margin of the foramen magnum between the vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve ; and the last near the lower end of the cord. Its use is to support the cord in the fluid by which it is surrounded. The Spinal Cord The Spinal Cord (medulla spinalis) is the cylindrical elongated part of the cerebro-spinal axis which is contained in the vertebral canal. Its length is usually about seventeen or eighteen inches, and its weight, when divested of its membranes and nerves, about one ounce and a half; its proportion to the encephalon being about I to 33. It does not nearly fill the canal in which it is contained, its investing membranes being separated from the surrounding walls by areolar tissue and a plexus of veins. It occupies, in the adult, the upper two-thirds of the vertebral canal, extending from the upper border of the atlas to the lower border of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a slender filament of grey substance, which is continued for some distance into the fihim terminale. In the foetus, before the third month it extends to the bottom of the sacral canal; but after this period it gradually recedes from below, as the growth of the bones composing the canal is more rapid in proportion than that of the cord ; so that in the child at birth the cord extends as far as the third lumbar vertebra. Its position varies also according to the degree of curvature of the spinal column, being raised somewhat in flexion of the spine. On examin- ing its surface, it presents a difference in its diameter in different parts, being marked by two enlargements, an upper or cervical, and a lower or lumbar. The678 NEKVOUS SYSTEM cervical enlargement, which is the larger, extends from about the third cervical to the first or second dorsal vertebra : its greatest diameter is in the transverse direction, and it corresponds with the origin of the nerves which supply the upper extremities. The lower, or lumbar, enlargement is situated opposite the last two or three dorsal vertebrje, its greatest diameter being from before backwards. It corresponds with the origin of the nerves which supply the lower extremities. In form, the spinal cord is a flattened cylinder. Fissures.—It presents on its anterior surface, along the middle line, a longi- tudinal fissure, the anterior median fissure ; and, on its posterior surface, another fissure, which also extends along the entire length of the cord, the posterior median fissure. These fissures penetrate through the greater part of the thickness of the cord, and incompletely divide the cord into two symmetrical halves, united in the middle line by a transverse band of nervous sub- stance, the commissure. The Anterior Median Fissure is wider, but of less depth than the posterior, extending into the cord for about one-third of its thickness, and is deepest at the lower part of the cord. It contains a prolongation from the pia mater; and its floor is formed by the anterior tvhite commissure, which is perforated by numerous blood-vessels, passing to the centre of the cord. The Posterior Median Fissure is not an actual fissure, as the space between the lateral halves of the posterior part of the cord is crossed by connective tissue and numerous blood-vessels, so that no actual hiatus exists, and there is consequently no prolonga- tion of the pia mater into it. It extends into the cord to about one half its depth, and its floor is formed by the 'posterior grey commissure. Lateral Fissures.—On each side of the anterior median fissure a linear series of foramina may be observed, indicating the points where the anterior roots of the spinal nerves emerge from the cord. This is called, by some anatomists, the antero-lateral fissure of the cord, although no actual fissure exists in this situation. And on each side of the posterior median fissure, along the line of attachment of the posterior roots of the nerves, a delicate fissure may be seen, leading down to the grey matter which approaches the surface in this situation; this is called the postero-lateral fissure of the spinal cord. On the posterior surface of the spinal cord, between the posterior median fissure and the postero-lateral fissure on each side, is a slight longitudinal furrow, marking off two slender tracts, the posterior median columns. These are most distinct in the cervical region, but are stated by Foville to exist throughout the whole length of the cord. Columns of the Cord.—Each half of the spinal cord is thus divided into four columns : an anterior column, a lateral column, a posterior column, and a posterior median column. The anterior column includes all the portion of the cord between the anterior median fissure and the line from which the anterior roots of the nerves arise. It is continuous with the pyramid of the medulla oblongata. The lateral column, the largest segment of the cord, includes all the portion between the line of origin of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves and the postero- lateral fissure. By some anatomists the anterior and lateral columns are included together under the name of the antero-lateral column, which forms rather more than two-thirds of the entire circumference of the cord. The posterior column is situated between the posterior median and postero- lateral fissures. The posterior median column is that narrow segment of the cord which is seen on each side of the posterior median fissure, usually included with the preceding as the posterior column.

Plan of the fissures and columns.679 SPINAL CORD Structure of the Cord.—If a transverse section of the spinal cord be made, it will be seen to consist of white and grey nervous substance. The white matter is situated externally, and constitutes the greater part. The grey substance occupies the centre, and is so arranged as to present on the surface of the section two crescentic masses, placed one in each lateral half of the cord, united together by a transverse band of grey matter, the grey commissure. Each crescentic mass has an anterior and posterior horn. The posterior horn is long and narrow, and approaches the surface of the posterolateral fissure, near which it presents a slight enlargement, the cayut cornu : from this it tapers, to form the ai^ex cornu, which at the surface of the cord becomes continuous with the fibres of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior horn is short and thick, and does not quite reach the surface, but extends towards the point of attachment of the anterior roots of the nerves. Its margin presents a dentate or stellate appearance. Owing to the pro- jections towards the surface of the anterior and posterior horns of the grey matter, each half of the cord is divided, more or less completely, into three columns, anterior, middle, and posterior : the anterior and middle being joined to form the antero-lateral column, as the anterior horn does not quite reach the surface. Fig. 403.—Transverse sections of the cord. Opposite middle of cervical Opposite middle of dorsal region. Opposite lumbar region. Fig. 404.—From a transverse section through the spinal cord of a calf. Magnified about 180 diameters, showing part of the central canal and the tissue immediately around it, viz. the central grey nucleus. (Klein and Noble Smith.) The canal is lined with epithelium, composed of cili- ated, more or less conical, cells ; in most instances a filamentous process passes from the cell,into the tissue underneath. This tissue contains, in a hya- line matrix, a network of fibrils ; most of these run horizontally, others have a longitudinal course, and appear therefore here cut transversely, i.e. as small dots. The nuclei correspond to the cells of the neuroglia, the cell-substance not being shown. Both the nuclei of the neuroglia cells and those of the epithelium contain three or more large disc-shaped particles. The commissure of the spinal cord is composed of white and grey fibres, hence called the white and grey commissures. The white commissure is formed of fibres, which pass horizontally between the grey matter of the anterior horn of one side and the anterior white column of the opposite side. The grey commissure, which connects the two crescentic masses of grey matter, is separated from the bottom of the anterior median fissure by the anterior white commissure. It consists of transverse fibres, with a considerable quantity of neuroglia between them. The fibres when they reach the lateral crescents diverge : some pass backwards to the posterior roots; others spread out, at various angles, into the cervix cornu. Running through the grey commissure of the whole length of the cord is a minute canal, which is barely visible to the naked eye in the human cord, but is proportionally larger in some of the lower vertebrata. It is called the central canal, and opens above into the fourth ventricle, and terminates below in a some- what dilated extremity. It is lined in the foetus by columnar ciliated epithelium, but in the adult the cilia have disappeared, and the canal is filled with their68o NERVOUS SYSTEM remains. The cells are supported on a layer of neuroglia, which is sometimes called the substantia gelatinosa centralis. The mode of arrangement of the grey matter, and its amount in proportion to the white, vary in different parts of the cord. Thus, the posterior horns are long and narrow, in the cervical region; short and narrower, in the dorsal; short, but wider, in the lumbar region. In the cervical region, the crescentic portions are small, and the white matter more abundant than in any other region of the cord. In the dorsal region, the grey matter is least developed, the white matter being also small in quantity. In the lumbar region, the grey matter is more abundant than Fig. 405.—Transverse section through the cervical portion of the spinal cord of a calf. Magnified 40 diameters. (Klein and Noble Smith.) Septa of connective, tissue in any other region of the cord. Towards the lower end of the cord, the white matter gradually ceases. The crescentic portions of the grey matter soon blend into a single mass, which forms the only constituent of the extreme point of the cord. Minute Anatomy of the Cord.—The cord consists of an outer part, composed of medullated nerve-fibres, which is the lohite substance; and of a central part, the grey matter : both supported in a peculiar kind of connective tissue, called neuroglia. The neuroglia consists of a homogeneous transparent matrix, of a network of very delicate fibrillse, and of small stellate or branched cells, the neuroglia cells. In addition to forming a ground substance, in which the nerve-fibres, nerve-SPINAL COED cells, and blood-vessels are embedded, a considerable accumulation of neuroglia takes place in three situations—(i) on the surface of the cord, beneath the pia mater ; (2) around the central canal; and (3) in the posterior part of the posterior horn, forming the substantia cinerea gelatinosa. The white substance of the cord consists of meduUated nerve-fibres, v^ith blood-vessels and neuroglia. On transverse section of the white substance of the cord, a very striking object is presented. It is seen to be studded all over with minute dots, surrounded by a white area, and this again by a dark circle (fig. 409). This is due to the longitudinal meduUated fibres seen on section. The dot is the axis-cylinder, the white area the substance of Schwann, and the dark circle the tubular membrane of the fibres, which seems to consist of several laminae. Externally, the neuroglia is seen to form a delicate connective sheath round the outer surface of the cord immediately beneath the pia mater, from which numerous septa pass in to separate the respective bundles of fibres and extend between the individual nerve-fibre-s, acting as a supporting medium in which they are embedded. Thus it will be seen that the greater bulk of the white matter of the cord is made up of longitudinal meduUated fibres, which are arranged in groups forming the anterior, lateral, and posterior columns. There are, however, also oblique and transverse fibres in the white substance. These are principally found (i) at the bottom of the anterior median fissure, forming the white commissure ; the fibres passing from the grey matter of the anterior horn on one side to the white matter of the anterior column of the opposite side; (2) horizontal or oblique fibres passing from the roots of the nerves into the grey matter; and (3) fibres leaving the grey matter and pursuing a longer or shorter horizontal course between the bundles of longitudinal fibres with which many of them are continuous. The investigation of pathological lesions has shown that the white matter of the cord consists of certain columns or tracts of fibres ; for it has been found that separate lesions are strictly limited to certain well-determined parts of the organ without involving neighbouring regions. That these parts or fasciculi correspond to so many distinct anatomical systems, each endowed with special functions, seems abundantly proved hy the researches of Flechsig and others on the develop- ment of the cord during the^ later periods 'of utero-gestation and in the newly born infant. Thus, on either side of the anterior median fissure a portion of the anterior column is divided off as the Direct pyramidal fasciculus (fasciculus of Tiirck), whichNERVOUS SYSTEM 682 can be traced to be continuous with the non-decussating fibres of the pyramid of the medulla. The remainder of the anterior column of the cord forms the fundamental fasciculus, which is continued into the deeper part of the medulla. The lateral column of the cord is divided into four tracts, the anterior division of which is called the anterior radicular zone, the peripheral portion of the posterior part the cerebellar column, and the internal part, next the grey substance, is termed the mixed lateral column; whilst an intermediate portion, between these last two, is the crossed pyramidal fasciculus, its fibres when traced upwards forming the decussating portion of the pyramid of the medulla oblongata. The other three portions of the lateral column can be traced into the lateral tract of the medulla, the peripheral fibres, or those forming the cerebellar column, passing through it to the cerebellum. The posterior column of the cord is divided into two : the portion which lies next the posterior median fissure is called the column of Goll (posterior median), Fig. 408.—Transverse section of the grey substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement. On the left side of the figure groups of large cells are seen; on the right side, the course of the fibres is shown without the cells. Magnified 13 diameters. and if traced upwards is found to be continuous with the fasciculus gracilis of the medulla. The remainder of the posterior column is called the cuneate fasciculus, or Burdach's column, (posterior external), and is prolonged into the medulla under the same name. The grey substance of the cord occupies its central part in the shape of two crescentic horns, joined together by a commissure. Each of these crescents has an anterior and posterior cornu. The posterior horn consists of two parts—the cajmt cornu, or expanded extremity of the horn (fig. 408), round which is a lighter space or lamina, of gelatinous substance ; and the cervix cornu, or narrower portion, which connects it with the rest of the grey substance. The gelatinous substance is a peculiar accumulation of neuroglia (Klein), and has been named by Rolando the substantia cinerea gelatinosa. The anterior horn of the grey substance in the cervical and lumbar swellings, where it gives origin to the nerves of the extremities, is much larger than in anySPINAL CORD 683 other region, and contains several distinct groups of large and variously shaped cells. In addition to this, in certain parts of the cord, other horns or projections of the grey matter may be seen on transverse section. One of these, the lateral horn, is found projecting outwards from the lateral region of the grey matter on a level with the grey commissure in the cervical and upper part of the dorsal region of the cord ; and a second, Clarke s vesicular column, is found on the inner side of the posterior horn near the grey commissure, in the upper cervical or dorsal regions, or at the point of exit of the lower lumbar nerves. The grey commissure is situated behind the white commissure, which separates it from the bottom of the anterior median fissure. The grey substance of the cord consists of—(i) nerve-fibres of variable but smaller average diameter than those of the columns; (2) nerve-cells of various Fig. 409.—Longitudinal section of the white and grey substance of the spinal cord, through the mid- dle of the lumbar enlargement. Magnified 14 diameters. Fig. 410.—Transverse section through the white matter of the spinal cord of a calf. Magnified (Klein and Noble Smith.) In the upper part are shown two isolated flattened micleated cells of the neuroglia, under a somewhat higher power than the rest. In the bulk of the figure the nerve-fibres are seen in transverse section. They are of different sizes, and possess a laminated medullary sheath surrounding the axis-cylinder; which was deeply stained in the preparation, and is here represented by a black dot. The nerve-fibres are imbedded in the neuroglia. This contains, in a matrix, which appears sometimes granular, some- times homogeneous, numerous elastic fibrils, seen here in trans- verse section as minute dots, on account of their having a course parallel to the long axis of the cord. Amongst the neuroglia are also seen two branched connective-tissue cells—neuroglia cells. An.lr Jlcots shapes and sizes, with from two to eight processes ; (3) blood-vessels and connective tissue. The nerve-fihres of the grey matter of the posterior horn are for the most part composed of a minute and dense network of minute fibrils, which is termed ' Gerlach's nerve network,' intermingled with nerves of a larger size. This net- work is continuous with the medullated fibres of the posterior nerve-roots on the one hand (Dieters), and with the branched processes of the ganglion-cells on the other (Gerlach), so that the ganglion-cells are connected with the medullated fibres of the posterior nerve-roots only indirectly through the nerve network. The arrangement of the fibres in the anterior horn of the grey matter appears to be somewhat different ; here the medullated fibres of the anterior nerve-roots are directly continuous with some of the processes of the ganglion-cells, others of the processes of the gangiion-cells communicating with Gerlach's nerve network. The nerve-cells of the grey matter are of two kinds, large branched nerve-684 NERVOUS SYSTEM vesicles which are collected into groups, and small round cells Avhich resemble free nuclei, and are found scattered throughout the whole of the grey matter. In the anterior horn is a constant group, situated at the anterior part of the cornu, and sometimes termed the vesicular colimin of the anterior cornu. It consists of two groups of cells: one mesial, near the anterior column ; the other lateral, near the lateral column. At the base of the posterior horn on its inner side, and joining the grey commissure, is a group of nerve-cells, which give rise to the projection mentioned above as being seen on transverse section in the upper part of the cord, which is called Clarke's posterior vesicular column. At the junction of the anterior and posterior cornu, in the outer portion of the grey matter, is a third group of cells, the tractus inter medio-lateralis. In certain regions of the cord these cells extend in amongst the fibres of the white matter of the lateral column, and give rise to the lateral horn. In addition to these groups a few large scattered cells are found in the posterior horn, extending into the substantia cinerea gelatinosa. THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES Dissection.—To examine the brain with its membranes, the skiiU-cap must be removed. In order to effect this, saw through the external table, the section commencing, in front, about an inch above the margin of the orbit, and extending, behind, to a level with the occipital protuberance. Then break the internal table with the chisel and hammer, to avoid injuring the investing membranes or brain; loosen, and forcibly detach the skull-cap, when the dura mater will be exposed. The adhesion between the bone and the dura mater is very intimate, and much more so in the young subject than in the adult. The membranes of the brain are, the dura mater, arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. Dura Mater The Dura Mater is a thick and dense inelastic fibrous membrane, which lines the interior of the skull. Its outer surface is rough and fibrillated, and adheres closely to the inner surface of the bones, forming their internal periosteum, this adhesion being most marked opposite the sutures and at the base of the skull. Its inner surface is smooth, and lined by a layer of endothelial cells. It sends three processes inwards, into the cavity of the skull, for the support and protection of the different parts of the brain : and is prolonged to the outer surface of the skull, through the various foramina which exist at the base, and thus becomes continuous with the pericranium ; its fibrous layer forms sheaths for the nerves which pass through these apertures. At the base of the skull, it sends a fibrous prolongation into the foramen caecum; it sends a series of tubular prolongations round the filaments of the olfactory nerves as they pass through the cribriform plate, and also round the nasal nerve as it passes through the nasal slit; a prolongation is also continued through the sphenoidal fissure into the orbit, and another is continued into the same cavity through the optic foramen forming a sheath for the optic nerve, which is continued as far as the eyeball. In the posterior fossa it sends a process down the internal auditory meatus, ensheathing the facial and auditory nerves ; another through the jugular foramen, forming a sheath for the structures which pass through this opening, and a third through the anterior condyloid foramen. Around the margin of the foramen magnum it is closely adherent to the bone, and is continuous wdth the dura mater lining the spinal canal. In certain situations, as already mentioned (page 632), the fibrous layers of this membrane separate, to form sinuses for the passage of venous blood. Upon the outer surface of the dura mater, in the situation of the longitudinal sinus, may be seen numerous small whitish bodies, the glandules Pacchioni. Structure.—The dura mater consists of white fibrous and elastic tissues, arranged in flattened laminae, which are divisible into two layers, the fibres of the two layers intersecting each other obliquely. A layer of nucleated endothelial cells,685 THE BKAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES similar to those found, on serous membranes, lines its inner surface ; these were formerly regarded as belonging to the arachnoid membrane. Its arteries are very numerous, but are chiefly distributed to the bones. Those found in the anterior fossa are the anterior meningeal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal and internal carotid, and a branch from the middle meningeal. In the middle fossa are the middle and small meningeal branches of the internal maxillary, a branch from the ascending pharyngeal, which enters the skull through the foramen lacerum medium basis cranii, branches from the internal carotid, and a recurrent branch from the lachrymal. In the posterior fossa are meningeal branches from the occipital: one of which enters the skull through the jugular foramen, and the other through the mastoid foramen ; the posterior meningeal, from the vertebral; occasionally meningeal branches from the ascending pharyngeal, which enter the skull, one at the jugular foramen, the other at the anterior condyloid foramen, and a branch from the middle meningeal. The veins, which return the blood from the dura mater, and partly from the bones, anastomose with the diploic veins. These vessels terminate in the various sinuses, with the exception of two which accompany the middle meningeal artery, and pass out of the skull at the foramen spinosum to join the internal maxillary vein. The nerves of the dura mater are, the recurrent branch of the fourth, and filaments from the Gasserian ganglion, from the ophthalmic and hypoglossal nerves, and from the sympathetic. The so-called giandulae Pacchioni are numerous small whitish granulations, usually collected into clusters of variable size, which are found in the following- situations :—I. Upon the outer surface of the dura mater, in the vicinity of the superior longitudinal sinus, being received into little depressions on the inner surface of the calvarium. 2. On the inner surface of the dura mater. 3. In the superior longitudinal sinus. 4. On the pia mater, near the margin of the hemispheres. These bodies are not glandular in structure, but simply enlarged normal villi of the arachnoid. In their growth they perforate the dura mater, and are thus found on its outer surface, and when of large size they cause absorption of the bone, and come to be lodged in pits or depressions on the inner table of the skull. The manner in which they perforate the dura mater is as follows:—at an early period of their growth they project through minute holes in the inner layer of the dura mater, which open into large venous spaces situated in the tissues of the membrane, on either side of the longitudinal sinus and communicating with it. In their onward growth the villi push the outer layer of the dura mater before them, and this forms over them a delicate membranous sheath. In structure they consist of trabecule of connective tissue, covered over by a layer of endothelium. The spongy tissue of which they are composed is continuous with the trabecular tissue of the subarachnoid space. These bodies are not found in infancy, and very rarely until the third year. They are usually found after the seventh year ; and from this period they increase in number as age advances. Occasionally they are wanting. Processes of the Dura Mater.—The processes of the dura mater, sent inwards into the cavity of the skull, are three in number : the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and the falx cerebelli. The falx cerebri, so named from its sickle-like form, is a strong arched process of the dura mater, which descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain. It is narrow in front, where it is attached to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone ; and broad behind, where it is connected with the upper surface of the tentorium. Its upper margin is convex, and attached to the inner surface of the skull as far back as the internal occipital protuberance. In this situation it is broad, and contains the superior longitudinal sinus. Its lower margin is free, concave, and presents a sharp curved edge, which contains the inferior longitudinal sinus. The tentorium cerebelli is an arched lamina of dura mater, elevated in the686 NERVOUS SYSTEM middle, and inclining downwards towards the circumference. It covers the upper surface of the cerebellum, and supports the occipital lobes of the brain, and prevents them pressing upon the cerebellum. It is attached, behind, by its convex border to the transverse ridges upon the inner surface of the occipital bone, and there encloses the lateral sinuses ; in front, to the superior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, enclosing the superior petrosal sinuses; and at the apex of this bone, the free or internal border and the attached or external border meet, and, forming two processes, cross one another and are continued forwards, to be attached to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes respectively. Along the middle line of its upper surface the posterior border of the falx cerebri is attached, the straight sinus being placed at their point of junction. Its anterior border is free and concave, and presents a large oval opening for the transmission of the crura cerebri. The falx cerehelli is a small triangular process of dura mater, received into the indentation between the two lateral lobes of the cerebellum behind. Its base is attached, above, to the under and back part of the tentorium; its posterior margin, to the lower division of the vertical crest on the inner surface of the occipital bone. As it descends, it sometimes divides into two smaller folds, which are lost on the sides of the foramen magnum. Arachnoid Membrane The arachnoid [apaxvy] etSos, like a spider's weh), so named from its extreme thinness, is a delicate membrane which envelops the brain, lying between the pia mater internally and the dura mater externally ; from this latter membrane it is separated by a space, the subdural space. It invests the brain loosely, being separated from direct contact with the cerebral substance by the pia mater, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, the subaraclinoidean. On the upper surface of the cerebrum the arachnoid is thin and transparent, and may be easily demonstrated by injecting a stream of air beneath it by means of a blowpipe; it passes over the convolutions without dipping down into the sulci between them. At the base of the brain the arachnoid is thicker, and slightly opaque towards the central part; it covers the anterior lobes, and extends across between the two temporo-sphenoidal lobes, so as to leave a consi- derable interval between it and the brain, the anterior subaraclinoidean' space ; it is in contact with the pons and under surface of the cerebellum ; but between the hemispheres of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata another considerable interval is left between it and the brain, called the posterior subaraclinoidean space. These two spaces communicate together across the crura cerehelli. The arachnoid membrane surrounds the nerves which arise from the brain, and encloses them in loose sheaths as far as their point of exit from the skull. The subarachnoid space is the interval between the arachnoid and pia mater : i this space is narrow on the surface of the hemispheres; but at the base of the brain a wide interval is left between the two temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and behind between the hemispheres of the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata. This space is the seat of an abundant serous secretion, the cerebro-spinal fluid, which fills up the interval between the arachnoid and pia mater. The subarachnoid space usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain by means of an opening in the inferior boundary of the fourth ventricle. The subdural space also contains fluid; this is, however, small in quantity compared with the cerebro-spinal fluid. Structure.—The arachnoid consists of bundles of white fibrous and elastic tissue intimately blended together. Its outer surface is covered with a layer of endothelium. From its inner surface are given off a number of bundles of fine connective tissue, which form a sponge-like trabecular network in the subarachnoid space, in the interstices of which the cerebro-spinal fluid is contained. Vessels of considerable size, but few in number, and, according to Bochdalek, a rich plexus ofDIVISIONS OF THE BRAIN 687 nerves derived from the motor division of the fifth, the facial, and the spinal accessory nerves, are found in the arachnoid. The cerehro-spinal fluid fills up the subarachnoid space. It is a clear, limpid fluid, having a saltish taste, and a slightly alkaline reaction. According to Lassaigne, it consists of 98*5 parts of water, the remaining 1-5 per cent, being solid matters, animal and saline. It varies in quantity, being most abundant in old persons, and is quickly reproduced. Its chief use is probably to afford mechanical protection to the nervous centres, and to prevent the effects of concussions communicated from without. PiA Matee The pia mater is a vascular membrane, and derives its blood from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. It consists of a minute plexus of blood-vessels, held together by an extremely fine areolar tissue. It invests the entire surface of the brain, dipping down between the convolutions and laminae, and is prolonged into the interior, forming the velum interpositum and choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle. Upon the surfaces of the hemispheres, where it covers the grey matter of the convolutions, it is very vascular, and gives off from its inner surface a multitude of minute vessels, which extend perpendicularly for some distance into the cerebral substance. At the base of the brain, in the situation of the anterior and posterior perforated spaces, a number of long straight vessels are given off, which pass through the white matter to reach the grey substance in the interior. On the cerebellum the membrane is more delicate, and the vessels from its inner surface are shorter. Upon the crura cerebri and pons Varolii its characters are altogether changed; it here presents a dense fibrous structure, marked only by slight traces of vascularity. According to Fohmann and Arnold, this membrane contains numerous lymphatic vessels. Its nerves are derived from the sympathetic, and also from the third, fifth, sixth, facial, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory. They accompany the branches of the arteries. Divisions of the Brain The brain {enceplialon) is that portion of the cerebro-spinal axis which is con- tained in the cranial cavity. It is divided into four principal parts: viz. the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the pons Varolii, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebrum forms the largest portion of the enceplialon, and occupies a considerable part of the cavity of the cranium, resting in the anterior and middle fossffi of the base of the skull, and separated posteriorly from the cerebellum by the tentorium cerebelli. About the middle of its under surface is a narrow constricted portion, part of which, the cmra cerebri, is continued onwards into the pons Varolii below, and through it to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord ; whilst another portion, the crura cerebelli, passes down into the cerebellum. The cerebellum (little-brain, or after-brain) is situated in the inferior occipital foss«, being separated from the under surface of the occipital lobes of the cerebrum by the tentorium cerebelli. It is connected to the rest of the encephalon by means of connecting bands, called crura: of these, two ascend to the cerebrum, two descend to the medulla oblongata, and two blend together in front, forming the pons Varolii. The pons Varolii is that portion of the encephalon which rests upon the upper part of the basilar process of the occipital bone and body of the sphenoid bone. It constitutes the bond of union of the various segments above named, receiving, above, the crura from the cerebrum ; at the sides, the crura from the cerebellum ; and below, the medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata extends from the lower border of the pons Varolii to the upper part of the spinal cord. It lies beneath the cerebellum, resting on the lower part of the basilar groove of the occipital bone.NERVOUS SYSTEM 688 Weight of the Encephalon.—The average weight of the brain, in the adult male, is 49^ oz., or a little more than 3 lb. avoirdupois ; that of the female, 44 oz.; the average difference between the two being from 5 to 6 oz. The prevailing weight of the brain, in the male, ranges betAveen 46 oz. and 53 oz.; and, in the female, between 41 oz. and 47 oz. In the male, the maximum weight out of 278 cases was 65 oz. and the minimum weight 34 oz. The maximum weight of the adult female brain, out of 191 cases, was 56 oz., and the minimum weight 31 oz. According to Luschka, the average weight of a man's brain is 1,424 grammes (about 45 oz.), of a woman's 1,272 grammes (about 41 oz.), and according to Krause, 1,570 grammes (about 48^ oz.) for the male, and 1,350 (about 43 oz.) for the female. It appears that the weight of the brain increases rapidly up to the seventh year, more slowly to between sixteen and twenty, and still more slowly to between thirty and forty, when it reaches its maximum. Beyond this period, as age advances and the mental faculties decline, the brain diminishes slowly in weight, about an ounce for each subsequent decennial period. These results apply alike to both sexes. The size of the brain was formerly said to bear a general relation to the intel- lectual capacity of the individual. Cuvier's brain weighed rather more than 64 oz., that of the late Dr. Abercrombie 63 oz., and that of Dupuytren 62^ oz. On the other hand, the brain of an idiot seldom weighs more than 23 oz. But these facts are by no means conclusive, and it is well known that these weights have been equalled by the brains of persons who never displayed any remarkable intellect. Dr. Haldennan, of Cincinnati, has recorded the case of a mulatto, aged 45, whose brain weighed 68| oz.; he had been a slave, and was never regarded as particularly intelligent; he was illiterate, but is said to have been reserved, meditative, and economical. Dr. Ensor, district medical officer at Port Elizabeth, reports that the brain of Carey, the Irish informer, weighed 61 oz. M. Nikiforoff has published an article on the subject of the weight of brains in the Novosti. According to him, the weight of the brain has no influence whatever on the mental faculties. It ought to be remembered that the significance of the weight of the brain should depend upon the proportion it bears to the dimensions of the whole body and to the age of the individual. It is equally important to know what was the cause of death, for long illness or old age exhausts the brain. To define the real degree of development of the brain, it is therefore necessary to have a knowledge of the condition of the whole body ; and, as this is usually lacking, the mere record of weight possesses little significance. The human brain is heavier than that of all the lower animals, excepting the elephant and whale. The brain of the former weighs from eight to ten pounds ; and that of a whale, in a specimen seventy-five feet long, weighed rather more than five pounds. Medulla Oblongata The medulla oblongata, or bulb, is the upper enlarged part of the spinal cord, and extends from the lower margin of the foramen magnum to the lower border of the pons Varolii. It is directed from above obliquely downwards and backwards; its anterior surface rests on the basilar groove of the occipital bone, its posterior surface is received into the fossa between the hemispheres of the cerebellum, forming the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is pyramidal in form, its broad extremity directed upwards, its lower end being narrow at its point of connection with the cord. It measures an inch in length, three-quarters of an inch in breadth at its widest part, and half an inch in thickness. Its surface is marked, in the median line, in front and behind, by an anterior and posterior median fissure, which are continuous with those of the spinal cord. The anterior fissure contains a fold of pia mater, and terminates just below the pons in a cul-de-sac, the foramen ccecum. It is interrupted at its lower part by some bundles of fibres, which cross obliquely from one side to the other, forming the decussation of the pyramids. The posterior is a deep but narrow fissure, continued upwards to about the middle of the medulla, where it expands into the fourth ventricle. These two fissures689 MEDULLA OBLONGATA divide the medulla into two symmetrical halves, each lateral half presenting elongated eminences which are continuous with the columns of the cord. By taking the lines along which some of the cranial nerves emerge from the medulla, as landmarks, we may divide the surface of this portion of the nervous system into three columns, just in the same way as the spinal cord is divided into three columns by the lines corresponding to the points of exit of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. The anterior column comprises that portion which is situated between the anterior median fissure and the fibres of origin of the hypoglossal nerve: this column is called the pyramid. The lateral column comprises that portion which is situated between the fibres of origin of the hypoglossal nerve and the fibres of origin of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves. In the lower part of the medulla this column is single, and is called the lateral tract; but in the upper part an oval-shaped body comes forward between it and the pyramid, pushing aside the lateral tract. This is called the olivary body. The posterior column comprises that portion which is situated between the fibres of origin of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves, and the pos- terior median fissure. This column is marked by slight furrows marking off smaller columns, and these in the lower part of the medulla are named, from without inwards, the funiculus of Bolando, the funiculus cuneatus, and the funiculus gracilis; in the upper part of the medulla, the funi- culus of Rolando and the funiculus cuneatus appear to become fused to- gether, forming a single body called the res tif07711 body. The pyramids are two pyramidal bundles of white matter, placed one on either side of the anterior median fissure, and separated from the olivary body, which is external to them, by a slight depression. At the lower border of the pons they are somewhat con- stricted ; they then become enlarged, and taper as they descend, being continuous below, by their outer portion, with the anterior columns of the cord (direct pyramidal tract), and by their inner portion with the decussating fibres, seen in the anterior median fissure, which are derived from the lateral column of the cord [crossed pyramidal tract). For, on separating the pyramids below, it will be observed that their innermost fibres form from four to five bundles on each side, which decussate with one another across the anterior median fissure ; this decussa- tion, however, is not formed of fibres from the anterior column of the cord, but from the deep portion of the lateral columns which pass forwards to the surface on the inner side of the anterior columns. The outermost fibres do not decussate; they are derived, as just stated, from the anterior column of the cord. The lateral column, in the lower part of the medulla, is of the same width as the lateral column of the cord, and appears on the surface to be a direct continuation of it. In the upper part of the medulla, the lateral tract, on account of the inter- polation of the olivary body, is reduced to a narrow strip, lying between the olivary and restiform bodies. The olivary body is a prominent oval mass, situated behind the pyramid, from which it is separated by a slight groove, along which the hypoglossal nerve arises. It is separated externally from the restiform body by a longitudinal narrow band of fibres, the continuation upwards of the lateral tract, and by a Y Y Fig. 411.—Medulla oblongata and pons Varolii. Anterior surface.NEEVOUS SYSTEM 690 Fig. 412.—Posterior surface of the medulla oblongata. groove, from which the giosso-pharyngeal, pnenmogastric, and spinal accessory nerves arise. It is equal in breadth to the pyramid ; is a little broader above than below, and is about half an inch in length, being separated above from the pons Varolii by a slight depression, in which is sometimes to be seen a band of arched fibres. Numerous white fibres (sujjerficial arciform fibres) are seen winding across the lower half of the pyramid and the olivary body to enter the restiform body. The funiculus of Eolando is a longitudinal prominence, on the outer side of the lateral tract. It begins at the lower end of the medulla by a tapering extremity, and gradually enlarging as it ascends, forms at a level with the lower border of the olivary body a slight prominence, known as the tubercle of Rolando. About half an inch below the pons, it appears to blend with the funiculus cuneatus. In front, it is separated from the lateral tract by a distinct groove, the continuation upwards of the posterolateral groove of the cord ; behind, the separation from the funiculus cuneatus is much less distinct. The funiculus cuneatus is the direct continuation upw^ards of the posterior lateral column of the cord. It is situated between the funiculus of Eolando and the funiculus gracilis ; it enlarges as it ascends, and forms, opposite the lower extremity of the fourth ventricle, a slight eminence or enlargement, the tuberculum cuneatum, which is best marked in chil- dren. About half an inch below the pons it appears to blend with the funiculus of Eolando. The restiform bodies appear on the surface to be the direct continuation up- wards of the funiculus of Eolando and the funiculus cuneatus. But they also receive the arched fibres (arciform), pre- sently to be described, and fibres derived from the lateral column of the cord, or the lateral cerebellar tract. The resti- form bodies are the largest prominences of the medulla, and are placed between the lateral tracts in front and the funi- ^ ^ _ cuius gracilis behind, from both of which ^' ? I they are separated by slight grooves. As ^ they ascend they diverge from each other, assist in forming the lower part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle, and then enter the ■ corresponding hemisphere of the cerebellum, forming its inferior peduncles. The funiculus gracilis is the direct continuation upwards of the posterior median column of the cord. It is a narrow white cord, placed parallel to and along the side of the posterior median fissure. It is separated from the funiculus cuneatus below and the restiform body above by a slight groove, which is con- tinuous with the groove on the surface of the cord, which marks off the posterior median column. It consists entirely of white fibres, and is the direct continuation of the posterior median column of the cord. At first the funiculi of the two sides lie in close contact on either side of the posterior median fissure. Opposite the apex of the fourth ventricle they form an enlargement (clava), and then diverging, form the lateral boundaries of the lower part of the fourth ventricle, and gradually tapering off they soon become no longer traceable. Restiform body Clava Cuneate tuhercle 2 oMEDULLA OBLONGATA 69T The posterior surface of the medulla oblongata forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. This portion is of a triangular form, bounded on each side by the diverging funiculi graciles and restiform bodies, and is that part of the ventricle which, from its resemblance to the point of a pen, is called calamus scrimp- torius. The divergence of the funiculi graciles and restiform bodies opens to view the grey matter of the medulla, which is continuous below with the grey matter of the cord. In the middle line is seen a longitudinal furrow, which ends below near the point of the calamus, in a somewhat cleft-like space, the ventricle of Arantius, which opens by a minute hole into the central canal of the cord. The arciform or arcuate fibres, which have been mentioned as forming part of the restiform body, are found in the upper half of the medulla, both crossing its surface and traversing its substance. They are divided for the purpose of descrip- tion into two sets—superficial and deep. The superficial arciform fibres have already been alluded to as crossing the pyramid and olivary body on each side. They emerge from the anterior median fissure, in which they can be traced to enter the raphe and cross it, after which they become no longer traceable. After emerging from the anterior median fissure they cross the pyramid and olivary body, and enter the restiform body. As they cross the olivary body they are reinforced by some of the deep arciform fibres which come to the surface on the inner side of, or through, this structure. The deep arc form fibres are described with the Microscopic Anatomy of the Medulla. Structure.—The medulla oblongata, like the spinal cord, consists of both grey and white matter, and exhibits in section both these structures arranged in certain definite masses. The fibres of the several columns of the cord enter the medulla, and in it undergo a rearrangement, some of them passing through it to the pons Varolii, the cerebrum, and the cerebellum, while others end in its grey substance. Some fibres take origin in the medulla, and are continued onwards to the cerebrum and cerebellum. The structure of the medulla will be best understood by tracing its several parts upwards from the spinal cord. The pyramid is composed of fibres derived from the direct pyramidal tract of the anterior columm of the cord of its own side, and from the crossed pyramidal tract of the lateral column of the opposite half of the cord. Those fibres which are derived from the direct pyramidal tract, and which in the cord lie close to the median fissure, are in the medulla placed to the outer side of the pyramid, being- pushed aside, as it were, by the interpolation of the fibres derived from the crossed pyramidal tract, which are much more numerous. The crossed pyramidal fibres ascend from the lateral column of the spinal cord, and, passing through the anterior grey cornua and across the median fissure, form the inner part of the pyramid. The fibres of the pyramid may be traced upwards through the pons to the crus cerebri of its own side. All the fibres of the anterior column of the cord are not continued into the pyramid of the medulla ; some of them pass backwards, and enter the forinatio reticularis, which is described with the Microscopic Anatomy of the Medulla. The olivary body when cut across obliquely is seen to be composed, externally of white fibres, internally of a grey layer, the corpus dentatuvi, which is arranged in the form of a hollow capsule, open at its upper and inner part and presenting a zigzag or dentated outline. White fibres enter the interior of this capsule by the aperture at its upper and inner part, constituting the olivary loeduncle. The lateral tract of the medulla is the continuation upwards of the lateral column of the cord. The fibres from it divide into three sets : one set, the most numerous, pass deeply behind the olivary body, and ascend through the formatio reticularis to ths pons ; a second set pass across the anterior median fissure to join the pyramid, forming the crossed pyramidal set; the third set, few in number, form a small band, which passes backwards to the restiform body to enter the cerebellum, forming the lateral cerebellar tract. The funiculus of Rolando, which is a longitudinal prominence on the outer Y Y 2692 NEEVOUS SYSTEM side of the lateral tract, is now seen to be the enlarged head of the x3osterior cornu of the grey matter which is disjDlaced laterally in consequence of the increase in size of the posterior columns of the medulla, so that it lies almost at right angles to the posterior median fissure, and approaching the surface forms a prominence which is covered over by a very thin layer of white matter, derived from the funiculus cuneatus. Its most prominent part on the surface is called the tubercle of Rolando. The funiculus cuneatus is the direct continuation upwards of the posterolateral column of the cord. Its white fibres are derived from this region of the cord. The fibres appear to end in the grey matter w^hich forms the so-called nucleus of this column; this nucleus, at first narrow, gradually enlarges, and produces, externally, the eminence mentioned above as the tuberculum cuneatum. The funiculus gracilis is the direct continuation upwards of the posterior median column of the cord. It consists entirely of white fibres, which are continuous with those of this region of the cord. Like the funiculus cuneatus its fibres appear to end in its so-called nucleus, which produces externally the prominence mentioned above as the clava. The restiform body is mainly constituted by the fusing together of the funiculus of Eolando and the funiculus cuneatus, to which are added the arciform fibres of the medulla and the lateral cerebellar tract from the lateral tract of the medulla. In addition to these, a bundle of fibres has been described by Solly as passing from the anterior column of the cord obliquely upwards below the olivary body to the restiform body. The white fibres of the restiform body are continued upwards to the cerebellum, forming its inferior peduncle. Microscopic Anatomy of the Medulla.—If the cranial nerves emerging from the medulla are traced into its substance, it will be seen that they divide each hemisphere of the medulla into three wedge-shaped areas, which have been named the anterior, lateral, and posterior areas of the medulla. The anterior area comprises that portion which is situated between the anterior median fissure and the fibres of origin of the hypoglossal nerve. On the surface of the medulla this area corresponds to the pyramid. The lateral area> comprises that portion which is situated between the fibres of origin of the hypoglossal nerve and the fibres of origin of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves. On the surface of the medulla, in its lower part, this area is single, and is called the lateral tract; but in the upper part an oval-shaped body comes forward between it and the pyramid, pushing aside the lateral tract. This oval-shaped body is the olivary body. The i^osterior area comprises that portion which is situated between the fibres of origin of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves and the posterior median fissure. On the surface of the medulla, this area is marked by slight furrows marking off smaller columns; these, in the lower part of the medulla, are named, from without inwards, the funiculus of Eolando, the funiculus cuneatus, and the funiculus gracilis ; in the upper part of the medulla, the funiculus of Eolando and the funiculus cuneatus appear to become fused together, forming a single body, called the restiform body. The Arciform fibres.—Deep set.—The deep arciform fibres are more numerous than the superficial set; they traverse the whole area of the upper half of the medulla, except the pyramid. They pass from the raphe ; some become superficial and join the superficial arciform fibres ; while others remain deep and pass to the restiform body and to the nuclei of the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis. The raphe.—The raphe is situated in the middle line of the medulla, above the decussation of the pyramids. It consists of nerve-fibres intermingled with nerve-cells. The fibres have different directions which can only be seen in suitable microscopic sections ; thus— I. Some are antero-posterior; these are continuous in front with the superficial arciform fibres.693 MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY OF MEDULLA 2, Some are longitudinal; these are derived from the arciform fibres, which on entering the raphe change their direction and become longitudinal. 3. Some are oblique ; these are continuous with the deep arciform fibres which pass from the raphe. Some of the fibres of the raphe arise from the nuclei on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The formatio reticularis.—In the substance of the medulla behind the pyramid and olivary body is a peculiar reticulated structure, which has received the name of formatio reticularis ; the appearance it presents in sections of the medulla is due to its being composed of bundles of fibres running at right angles to each other, some being longitudinal, others transverse. Fig. 413.— Section of the medulla oblongata at about the middle of the olivary bod^y. (Schwalbe.) Anterior iiiedian fissure The longitudinal fibres are derived— 1. From the anterior column of the cord after the direct pyramidal tract has passed into the pyramid. 2. From the olivary body. 3. From the lateral column of the cord after the crossed pyramidal tract has passed into the pyramid. 4. From the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis. The transverse fibres are the deep arciform fibres. In the lateral part of this reticular structure grey matter containing large nerve-cells is found. The Grey Matter of the Medulla oblongata.—The grey matter of the medulla oblongata is partly continuous with the grey matter of the cord, and partly arranged in independent masses. It contains many multipolar ganglion-cells. In the lower part of the medulla, the grey matter, which is continuous with that of the cord, is arranged in the shape of two crescentic horns with their convexities towards each other and connected by a central commissure; but in the upper partNERVOUS SYSTEM 694 it loses its crescentic arrangement, becomes more abmidant, and is disposed with less regularity. The caput of the posterior horns becomes enlarged, and gradually shifted outwards, so that they form rounded masses, close under the lateral tract, and produce the prominence on the surface called the funiculus of Rolando. The neck of the cornu diminishes in size, and is broken up into a reticular formation by the passage of longitudinal and transverse fibres through it, so that the caput is separated from the rest of the grey matter. As the central canal expands into the fourth ventricle, the rest of the posterior horn of grey matter is pushed outwards into the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis; in each of these funiculi it forms a distinct accumulation of grey matter, constituting the nucleus cuneatus and the nucleus gracilis. The anterior horn of grey matter is broken up by the passage through it of the crossed pyramidal tract from the lateral column of the cord. By this means the anterior portion of the horn is completely isolated from the remainder, and constitutes the lateral nucleus of grey matter which is situated near the surface of the lateral tract. The greater part of the rest of the anterior horn being permeated by the decussating fibres presents a reticular formation. A small part of the base of the anterior cornu comes to the surface of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and is exposed to view by the divergence of the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis. It forms a continuous mass, which gradually increases in size and forms the eminence of the fasciculus teres. In it is a group of nerve-cells, which form the nucleus from which the roots of the hypoglossal nerve arise. At the base of the posterior cornu, in the lower part of the medulla, is a group of cells, which, if traced upwards, are found to be pushed on one side; so that in the floor of the fourth ventricle they are outside the hypoglossal nucleus and form a second eminence, the ala cinerea : from it arise the roots of the accessory portion of the spinal accessory, pneumogastric, and giosso-pharyngeal nerves. Outside this again, and towards the upper part of the medulla, is another group of cells from which most of the fibres of the auditory nerve take origin. Another independent mass of grey matter is found in the olivary body forming the corpus dentatum. It consists of a grey layer arranged in the form of a hollow capsule, open at its upper and inner part, and presenting a zigzag or dentated out- line. White fibres enter the interior of this capsule by the aperture at its upper and inner part, constituting the olivary peduncles. Some of these fibres terminate in the cells of the corpus dentatum, while others are continued through the grey layer to join the arciform fibres. Furthermore, two small isolated bands of grey matter are seen, one on the dorsal and the other on the mesial aspect of the corpus dentatum : these are known as accessory olivary nuclei. Pons Varolii The pons Varolii (tuber ajinulare) is the bond of union of the various segments of the encephalon, connecting the cerebrum above, the medulla oblongata below, and the cerebellum behind. It is situated above the medulla oblongata, below the crura cerebri, and between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. Its anterior surface presents a broad transverse band of white fibres, which arches like a bridge across the upper part of the medulla, extending between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum. This surface projects considerably beyond the level of these parts, is of quadrangular form, rests upon the clivus of the sphenoid bone, and is limited before and behind by very prominent margins. It presents along the middle line a longitudinal groove, wider in front than behind, which lodges the basilar artery: numerous transverse striae are also observed on each side, which indicate the course of its superficial fibres. li^ posterior surface forms part of the floor of the fourth ventricle.PONS VAROLII 695 At each side its fibres become contracted into a thick rounded cord, the cms cerebelli, which enters the substance of the cerebellum, constituting its middle peduncle. Structure.—The pons Varolii consists of two parts, which differ in appearance and structure from each other: the anterior or ventral half consists for the most part of fibres arranged in transverse and longitudinal bundles with a small amount of grey matter ; the posterior or dorsal half is a continuation of the reticular formation of the medulla with the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The anterior or ventral half consists of three layers of fibres : (i) superficial trans- verse fibres ; (2) superficial longitudinal fibres ; (3) deep transverse fibres. These three layers are not, however, completely differentiated from each other, for some transverse fibres may be seen between the bundles of the longitudinal fibres. The superficial transverse fibres (fig. 414) pass from the crus or middle peduncle of the Fig. 414.—Superficial dissection of the medulla oblongata and pons. (Ellis.) cerebellum to the median raphe of the pons, where they meet and interlace with those coming from the opposite side. They then dip deeply into the substance of the pons and pass to the crus cerebri of the opposite side. The superficial longi- tudinal fibres enter the pons below as a single mass, being the continuation upwards of the fibres of the pyramids of the medulla ; as they ascend they become broken up into bundles by some of the transverse fibres passing through them, and are continued into the superficial portion of the crus cerebri, much increased in number from being reinforced by the fibres derived from the nerve-cells in the deep transverse strata. The deep transverse fibres form a much thicker layer than the superficial set, and contain much grey matter between them. The fibres pass from the crus or middle peduncle of the cerebellum to the median raphe of the pons, where they meet and interlace with those coming from the opposite side. The posterior or dorsal portion of the pons is chiefly constituted by a continua-NERVOUS SYSTEM 696 tion upwards of the reticular formation of the medulla and by the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle. Microscopic Anatomy of the Pons.—This presents the same reticular structure as in the medulla, consisting of longitudinal fibres continued upwards from the medulla, with interlacing transverse fibres betw^een which is interspersed grey matter with nerve-cells, especially in the deeper layers. Many of the deep trans- verse fibres join the nerve-cells, which are situated in the grey matter (nuclei X>ontis) of this layer. From these cells other fibres are given off which ascend through the pons to the crus cerebri. In the lower part of this portion of the pons is a small isolated collection of grey matter, the superior olivary nucleus, enclosed by some of the deep transverse fibres, called the trapezium. It is situated close to the medulla, behind the superficial longitudinal fibres from the pyramid and immediately above the olivary body. The fibres of the trapezium, which are probably connected with the cells of the nucleus, pass to the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. Near the floor of the fourth ventricle important collections of nerve-cells are found, from which some of the cranial nerves arise. One of these forms the nucleus of the sensory root of the fifth nerve ; a second, the nucleus of the motor part of the same nerve; a third, the nucleus of the sixth nerve; and a fourth, the nucleus of the facial nerve. The nucleus of the auditory nerve, situated just at the junction of the pons and medulla, is prolonged upwards into the pons. Septum.—The posterior part of the pons is subdivided into lateral halves by a medium septum, but this does not extend into the anterior half, being here obliterated by the transverse fibres. It is formed mainly by the decussation and change in the direction of fibres as they cross the middle line. Cerebrum (fig. 415) The cerebrum constitutes the largest portion of the encephalon. Its under surface or base is of an irregular form, resting in front on the anterior and middle fossae of the skull, and behind upon the tentorium cerebelli. Its upper surface is of an ovoid form, broader behind than in front, convex in its general outline, and divided into lateral halves or hemispheres, right and left, by the great longitudinal fissure, which extends throughout the entire length of the cerebrum in the middle line, reaching down to the base of the brain in front and behind, but interrupted in the middle by a broad transverse commissure of white matter, the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres together. This fissure lodges the falx cerebri, and indicates the original development of the brain by two lateral halves. Each hemisphere presents an outer surface, which is convex to correspond with the vault of the cranium ; an inner surface, which is flattened, and in contact with the opposite hemisphere (the two inner surfaces forming the sides of the longitudinal fissure) ; and an under surface or base, of an irregular form, which rests in front on the anterior and middle fossae of the base of the skull, and behind upon the tentorium cerebelli. Upper Surface of the Cerebrum If the arachnoid and pia mater are removed, the entire surface of each hemi- sphere will be seen to present a number of depressions (fissiires and sulci) separating a number of convoluted eminences (the convolutions or gyri). The depressions are of two kinds, fissures and sulci. The fissures are few in number; they are constant in their arrangement, and are produced by the foldings of the cerebrum during the process of development. They involve both grey and white matter. The sulci are more numerous ; they are superficial depressions of the grey matter, which is folded inwards and only indents the central white substance ; they vary in different brains and in different parts of the same brain. The Convolutions.—There is no accurate resemblance between the convolutions697 CONVOLUTIONS OF CEREBEUM in different brains, nor are they exactly symmetrical on the two sides of the same brain, but their general arrangement or plan is fairly constant. Certain infoldings of the cerebrum take place at an early period of development and form important landmarks, which are constant and can without difficulty be recognised; but the secondary depressions and convolutions vary considerably. The number and extent of the convolutions, as well as their depth, appear to bear a close relation to the intellectual power of the individual, as is shown in their increasing complexity of arrangement as we ascend from the lowest mammalia up to man. Thus they are absent in some of the lower orders of mammalia, and they increase in number and extent through the higher orders. In man they present the most complex arrangement. Again, in the child at birth before the Fig. 415.—Upper surface of the brain, the arachnoid having been removed. FISSURE OP- ROLAMDO PARIETO-OCCIPITAL FISSURE! intellectual faculties are exercised, the convolutions have a very simple arrangement, presenting few undulations ; and the sulci between them are less deep than in the adult. In old age, when the mental faculties have diminished in activity, the convolutions become much less prominently marked. The convolutions on the outer convex surface of the hemisphere are the largest and most complicated convolutions of the brain; their general direction is more or less oblique ; they frequently branch like the letter Y in their course upwards and backwards, towards the longitudinal fissure: these convolutions attain their greatest development in man, and are especially characteristic of the human brain. Structure of the Convolutions.—The outer surface of each convolution, as well698 NERVOUS SYSTEM as the sides and bottom of the sulci between them, are composed of grey matter, which is here called the cortical substance. The interior of each convolution is composed of white matter ; and white fibres also blend with the grey matter at the sides and bottom of the sulci. By this arrangement the convolutions are adapted to increase the amount of grey matter without occupying much additional space, while they also afford a greater extent of surface for the termination of the white fibres in grey matter. The Lobes and Fissures of the Brain.—Each hemisphere of the brain on its external surface is divided into five lobes, the division being made by the main fissures and by imaginary lines drawn to connect them (fig. 416). The fissures dividing the five lobes on the external surface of the hemispheres are three in number, and are named : fissure of Sylvius, fissure of Bolando, and jjarieto-occipital fissure. Fig. 416.—Convolutions and fissures of the outer surface of the cerebral hemisphere. END OF CALLOSO- /MAf^GINAL FISSL/RP The fissure of Sylvius begins at the base of the brain at the anterior perforated space, and passes outwards to the external surface of the hemisphere. It gives off a short anterior limb, which passes forwards ; and another, ascending limb, which passes upwards into the inferior frontal convolution. It is then continued back- wards, as the horizontal limb, and terminates in the parietal lobe after curving upwards for a short distance. It separates the frontal and parietal lobes from the temporo-sphenoidal, and occupies the middle third of the lateral surface of the hemisphere. The fissure of Rolando is situated about the middle of the outer surface of the hemisphere. It commences at or near the longitudinal fissure, and runs downwards and forwards to terminate a little above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and about half an inch behind the ascending limb of the same fissure. It separates the frontal from the parietal lobe.CONVOLUTIONS OF CEREBEUM 699 The parieto-occipital fissure is only seen to a slight extent on the outer surface of the hemisphere, and is not so distinctly marked as the others. The portion on the outer surface of the hemisphere is sometimes called the externalparieto-occiintal fissure, to distinguish it from the continuation of the sulcus on the internal surface of the hemisphere, which would then be termed the internal parieto- occipital fissure. It commences about midway between the posterior extremity of the brain and the fissure of Rolando, and runs downwards and forwards for about an inch. It divides the parietal and occipital lobes. These three fissures divide the external surface of the hemisphere into five lobes : the frontal, the parietal, the occijntal, the temporo-sphenoidal, and the central or island of Beil. The frontal lobe is that portion of the brain which is situated in front of the fissure of Rolando and above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. Its under surface rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and is termed the orbital lobe. The outer surface of the frontal lobe presents three sulci, which divide it into four primary convolutions, i. The precentral sulcus runs upwards through this lobe, parallel to the lower half of the fissure of Rolando. It divides off a convo- lution, which lies between it and the fissure of Rolando, and which is called the ascending frontal convolution. 2 and 3. From it two sulci, the superior and inferior frontal sulci, run forwards and downwards and divide the remainder of the outer surface of the lobe—namely, that part in front of the precentral sulcus— into three principal convolutions, named respectively the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions. The under surface of the frontal lobe, which rests on the orbita^l plate of the frontal bone, is named the orbital lobe (fig. 417). It presents a well-marked groove or sulcus for the olfactory tract. The convolution internal to this sulcus forms part of the marginal gyrus, hereafter to be described. External to the sulcus this surface of the frontal lobe is divided into three convolutions by a well- marked sulcus, the orbital sulcus. These are named, from their positions, the internal, anterior, and posterior orbital convolutions, and are the continuation respectively of the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions. The ascefiding frontal convolution is a simple convolution, bounded in front by the precentral sulcus, behind by the fissure of Rolando, and extending from the upper margin of the hemisphere above to a little behind the bifurcation of the fissure of Sylvius below. The superior frontal convolution is situated between the margin of the longitu- dinal fissure and the superior frontal sulcus. It extends above on to the inner aspect of the hemisphere, forming the marginal convolution, and in front on to the orbital surface, forming the internal orbital convolution. It is much divided by secondary sulci. The middle frontal convolution is situated between the superior and inferior frontal sulci, and extends from the precentral sulcus to the lower margin of the lobe, where it forms the anterior orbital convolution. The inferior frontal convolution is situated below the inferior frontal sulcus, and extends from the lower part of the precentral sulcus, circling round the ascending and anterior limbs of the fissure of Sylvius to the under surface of the lobe, where it forms the posterior orbital convolution. The parietal lobe is situated between the frontal and occipital lobes, and is not much more than half the size of the former. It is bounded in front by the fissure of Rolando; behind, by the external parieto-occipital fissure, and a line drawn in continuation of that sulcus over the hemisphere ; and below, by the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and a line connecting this with the lower end of the superior occipital sulcus. Above, it extends to the longitudinal fissure. It presents for examination two sulci and three convolutions. The intraparietal sulcus commences close to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, about midway between the fissure of Rolando and the upturnedNERVOUS SYSTEM 700 extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. It first runs upwards parallel to and behind the lower half of the fissure of Rolando, and then turns backwards, extending nearly to the termination of the external parieto-occipital fissure, where it some- times becomes continuous with the superior occipital sulcus. The ascending portion of this sulcus separates off a convolution, the ascending parietal, which lies between it and the fissure of Rolando, whilst the horizontal portion divides the remainder of the parietal lobe into two other convolutions, the superior and inferior parietal. The post-central sulcus is a slightly marked groove, which is sometimes a branch of the intraparietal sulcus, being given off where the ascending portion of this sulcus turns backwards. It lies parallel to and behind the upper part of the fissure of Rolando, and separates the ascending from the superior parietal convolution.* The ascending parietal convolution is bounded in front by the fissure of Rolando, behind by the ascending portion of the intraparietal and the post- central sulci. It extends from the great longitudinal fissure above to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius below. It lies parallel with the ascending frontal convolution, with which it is connected below, and also generally above, the termination of the fissure of Rolando. The superior parietal convolution is bounded in front by the post-central sulcus which separates it from the previous convolution, but with which it is usually connected above the upper extremity of the sulcus; behind, it is bounded by the external parieto-occipital fissure, below the termination of which it is connected with the occipital lobe by a narrow convolution, ihQ first annectant gyrus. Below, it is separated from the inferior parietal convolution by the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus ; and above, it is continuous on the inner surface of the hemisphere with the quadrate lobe. The inferior parietal convolution is that portion of the parietal lobe which is situated between the ascending portion of the intraparietal sulcus in front, the horizontal portion of the same sulcus above, the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius below, and the posterior boundary of the parietal lobe behind. It is subdivided into two convolutions by an indistinct groove. One, the supra- marginal, lies behind the lower end of the intraparietal sulcus and above the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is connected, in front, with the ascending parietal convolution beneath the intraparietal sulcus, and Avith the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution behind, round the posterior extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. The other, the angular, is connected in front with the foregoing, and with the middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution by a process which curves round the superior temporo-sphenoidal or parallel sulcus. It is connected with the occipital lobe by the second annectant gyrus. The occipital lobe is triangular in shape and forms the posterior extremity of the hemisphere. It is bounded in front by the external parieto-occipital fissure and a line drawn from the extremity of this in the direction of the fissure across the outer surface of the hemisphere. It is continuous below and in front with the * Professor Cunningham describes these two sulci, the intraparietal and post-central, somewhat differently. He regards them as both belonging to the intraparietal sulcus, which he divides into three parts : the ascending portion of the intraparietal, as described above, he terms the ramus verticalis inferior ; the horizontal portion as the ramus Jiori- zontalis ; while the post-central sulcus he denominates the ramus verticalis superior. He states that considerable variabiHty is exhibited in the relation to each otlier of these different parts of the intraparietal sulcus, but that the one in wliich the three j)arts of the sulcus are confluent is by far the most constant condition. Sometimes, however, the three parts of the sulcus may be all separate, or the ramus horizontalis confluent with the ramus verticalis inferior, the ramus verticalis superior remaining separate ; or, again, the vertical limbs may be confluent and the horizontal limb separate ; or, finally, the ramus horizontalis may be joined to the lower end of the ramus verticalis superior, while the lower vertical limb is separate. The connection which sometimes exists between the intraparietal sulcus and the occipital lobe he calls the r^m^.'s occipitalis. In the majority of cases, however, the occipital ramus is separated from the main portion of the intra- parietal sulcus by a superficial or deep bridging convolution.

It is divided on the outer surface of the hemisphere into three convolutions by two indistinct sulci, the superior and middle occipital sulci. They are directed backwards across the lobe, being frequently small and ill-marked ; the superior is sometimes continuous with the horizontal portion of the intraparietal sulcus. The superior occipital convolution is situated above the superior sulcus, and is connected to the superior parietal convolution by the _^7'5^ annectant ggrus. The middle occipital convolution is situated between the superior and middle occipital sulci, and is connected to the angular convolution by the second annectant gyrus, and to the middle temporo-sphenoidal by the third annectant gyrus. The inferior occipital convolution is situated below the middle occipital sulcus, and is sometimes separated from the external occipito-temporal convolution on the under surface of the hemisphere by an inconstant sulcus, the inferior occipital Fig. 417.—Convolutions and fissures of the under surface of the anterior lobe. sulcus. It is connected to the inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution by the fourth annectant gyrtis. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe is that portion of the hemisphere which is lodged in the middle fossa of the base of the skull. In front and above, it is limited by the fissure of Sylvius ; behind, it is connected with the parietal and occipital lobes, and is limited artificially by a line continuing the direction of the external parieto- occipital fissure across the outer surface of the hemisphere. It is divided into three convolutions by two sulci. The superior of these runs parallel to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is named the superior temporo- sphenoidal or parallel sulcus, and is well marked and constant. The second, the middle temporo-sp)henoidal, is not so well marked or constant ; it takes the same course at a lower level.NEKVOUS SYSTEM 702 The superior temporo-sphoioidal convolution is situated between the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius and the superior temporo-sphenoidal sulcus. It is continuous behind with the supramarginal convolution. The middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution is situated between the superior and middle sulci of the same name, and is continuous behind with the angular and middle occipital convolutions. The inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution is situated below the middle temporo-sphenoidal sulcus, and is separated from the external occipito-temporal convolution, on the under surface of the hemisphere, by a sulcus which is called the inferior temporo-sphenoidal sulcus. It is connected with the inferior occipital convolution. The central lobe, or island of Reil (fig. 417), is situated in the fissure of Sylvius, at the base of the brain; it is separated, in front, from the posterior orbital convo- lution by a nearly transverse sulcus, the anterior sulcus of Bcil; externally, from the inferior frontal convolution and the lower ends of the ascending frontal and parietal convolutions, by another deep sulcus, the external sulcus of Beil ; and posteriorly, from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, by a third sulcus, the posterior sulcus of Reil. Fig. 418.—Convolutions and fissnres of the inner surface of the cerebral hemisphere. It is a triangular-shaped prominent cluster of about six convolutions, the ijyri operti, so called from being covered in by the fissure. By the removal of these convolutions the extraventricular part of the corpus striatum would be reached. On the inner or median surface of the hemispheres the arrangement of the convolutions is less complex; they are generally well defined, and some of them being of great length, there is not the same subdivision into smaller lobes as on the external surface (fig. 418). The fissures on the internal surface are five in number, and are named the calloso-marginal, the parieto-occipital, the calcarine, the collateral, and the dentate. The calloso-marginal fissure is seen in front, commencing below the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum ; it at first runs forwards and u^Dwards parallel with the rostrum of the corpus callosum, and, winding round the genu of that body, it continues from before backwards, between the upper margin of the hemisphere and the convolution of the corpus callosum, to about midway between the anterior and posterior extremities of the brain, where it turns upw^ards to reach the upper margin of the inner surface of the hemisphere a short distance behind the superior extremity of the furrow of Kolando. It separates the marginal convolution from the gyrus fornicatus or convolution of the corpus callosum.CONVOLUTIONS OF CEEEBRUM 703 The parieto-occipital fissure {internal parieto-occipital) is the continuation of the fissure of the same name seen on the outer surface of the hemisphere. It extends in an obHque direction downwards and forwards to join the calcarine fissure on a level with the hinder end of the corpus callosum. It separates the quadrate from the cuneate lobe. The calcarine fissure commences, usually by two branches, at the back of the hemisphere, runs nearly horizontally forwards, and is joined by the parieto-occipital fissure, and continues nearly as far as the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, to terminate a little below the level of this commissure. It separates the cuneate lobe from the uncinate gyrus, and causes the prominence known as the hippocampus minor or calcar avis, whence its name. The collateral fissure is situated below the preceding, being separated from it by the uncinate gyrus. It runs forwards, from the posterior extremity of the Fig. 419.—Side view of the brain of man, showing the localisation of various function?. (After Ferrier.) I.

It runs between the internal and external occipito-temporal convolutions. It lies below the posterior and middle horn of the lateral ventricle, and causes the prominence known as the eminentia collateralis. The dentate or hippocampal fissure commences immediately below the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and runs forward to terminate at the recurved part of the uncinate gyrus. It corresponds with the prominence of the hippocampus major in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. The lobes or convolutions seen on the internal surface of the hemisphere are six in number, and are named: gyncs fornicatus, marginal, quadrate, cuneate, uncinate, or internal occipito-temporal, and the external occipito-temporal. The gyrus fornicatus, or convolution of the corpus callosum, is a well-markedNERVOUS SYSTEM lobe which begins just. 11 front of the anterior perforated space at the base of the brain; it ascends in front of the genu of the corpus callosnm, and runs backwards along the upper surface of this body to its posterior extremity, where it joins the uncinate convolution. It is bounded above in the greater part of its extent by the calloso-marginal fissure, which separates it from the marginal convolution ; behind the spot where this fissure turns upwards it is continuous with the quadrate lobe. The marginal convolution is situated above the preceding, and has received its name from its position along the border of the hemisphere. It commences in front of the anterior perforated space, runs along the margin of the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the orbital lobe, being bounded externally by the sulcus for Fig. 420.—Top view of the brain of man, showing the localisation of various functions. (iVfter Ferrier.) Eeferences the same as in the preceding figure. the olfactory tract; it then turns upwards to the upper surface of the hemisphere, and runs backwards, forming the marginal convolution, on the inner surface, to the point where the calloso-marginal fissure turns upwards to reach the superior border of the hemisphere. The quadrate lobe {inecuneus) is the marginal convolution of the longitudinal fissure behind the calloso-marginal sulcus, lying between this fissure in front and the internal parieto-occipital behind. It joins the gyrus fornicatus below, and is continuous above with the superior parietal convolution. The cnneate or occipital lobule is triangular in shape, being situated between the internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures, which, as above mentioned, meet behind the posterior extremity of the gyrus fornicatus. The uncinate or internal occipito-temporal convolution extends from theTOPOGRAPHY OF CEREBRAL CONVOLUTIONS posterior extremity of the hemisphere to the fissure of Sylvius, being bounded above by the calcarine and dentate fissure and separated below from the external occipito-temporal convolution by the collateral fissure. From the anterior extremity a narrow portion is recurved or bent backwards in the form of a hook, which is sometimes called the crochet or uncus. The back part of this convolution—that is, the part below the calcarine fissure—is sometimes known as the lingual lobule or gyrus. The external occipito-temporal convolution is of considerable length, and lies between the collateral fissure and the inferior temporo-sphenoidal sulcus, which latter separates it from the inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution on the outer surface of the hemisphere. Besides the great primary convolutions above named and described, and which can be recognised in almost any well-developed brain, there are a great number of secondary convolutions which pass from one primary convolution to another, and often render the arrangement of the latter somewhat obscure ; of these, the connections of the occipital lobe, above mentioned, and which are named annectant convolutions, may be taken as examples. Cerebral Localisation and Topography.—Within the last few years physiological and pathological research have gone far to prove that the surface of the brain may be mapped out into series of definite areas, each one of which is intimately connected with some well-defined function. And this is especially true with regard to the convolutions on either side of the fissure of Rolando, which are believed by most physiologists of the present day to be concerned in motion, those grouped around the fissure being associated with move- ments of the extremities of the opposite side of the body, and those arolind the lower end of the fissure being related to movements of the mouth and tongue. This is not the place, nor can space be given, to describe these localities. But the two accompanying woodcuts from Ferrier (figs. 419, 420) have been introduced, and will serve to indicate the position of these areas as far as they have been at present ascertained. The relation of the principal fissures and convolutions of the cerebrum to the outer sm-face of the scalp has been the subject of much recent investigation, and many systems have been devised by which one may localise these parts fi'om an examination of the external surface of the head. These plans can only be regarded as approximately correct for several reasons: in the first place, because the relations of the convolutions and sulci to the surface are found to be very variable in different individuals; secondly, because the surface area of the scalp is greater than the surface area of the brain, so that lines drawn on the one cannot corre- spond exactly to sulci or convolutions on the other ; and thirdly, because the sulci and convolutions in two individuals are never precisely alike. Nevertheless, the principal fissures and convolutions can be mapped out with satficlent accuracy for all practical piu-poses, so that any particular convolution can be generally exposed by removmg with the trephine a certain portion of the skull's area. The various landmarks on the outside of the skull, which can be easily felt, and which serve as indications of the position of the parts beneath, have been already refered to (see page 193), and the relation of the fissures and convolutions to these landmarks is as follows:— Longitudinal Fissure.—This corresponds to a line drawn from the glabella at the root of the nose to the external occipital protuberance. The Fissure of Sylvius.—The position of the fissure of Sylvius and its horizontal limb is marked by a line starting from a point one inch and a quarter horizontally behind the external angular process of the frontal bone to a point three-quarters of an inch below the most prominent point of the parietal eminence. The first three-quarters of an inch will represent the main fissure, the remainder the horizontal limb. The bifurcation of the fissure is, therefore, two inches behind and about a quarter of an inch above the level of the external angular process. The ascending limb of the fissure passes upwards from this point parallel to, and immediately behind, the coronal suture. Fissure of Bolando.—To find the upper end of the fissure of Rolando, a measurement should be taken from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance. The position of the top of the sulcus will be, measuring from in front, 55-6 per cent, of the whole distance from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance. Professor Thane adopts a some- what simpler method. He divides the distance from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance over the top of the head into two equal parts, and having thus defined the middle point of the vertex, he takes half an inch behind it as the top of the sulcus. This is not quite so accurate as the former method, but it is sufficiently so for all practical purposes, and, on account of its simplicity, is very generally adopted. From this point the fissure runs downwards and forwards for 3f inches, its axis making an angle of 67° with the middle line. In order to mark this groove, two strips of metal may be employed : one, the shorter, being fixed to the middle of the other at the angle mentioned. z z7o6 NEEVOUS SYSTEM If the longer strip is now placed along the sagittal si;ture so that the junction of the two strips is over the point corresponding to the top of the furrow, the shorter, ohliqne strip will indicate the direction, and 3^ inches will mark the length of the furrow. Dr. AYilson has devised an instrument, called a cystometer, which combines the scale of measurements for localising the fissure, with data for representing its length and direction.* Professor Thane o-ives the lower end of the furrow as ' close to the posterior limb, and about half an inch behind the bifurcation of the fissure of Sjdvius.' So that, according to this anatomist, a line drawn from a point lialf an inch behind the mid-point between the glabella and external occipital protuberance to this spot would mark out the fissure of Rolando. Dr. Reid adopts a different method (fig. 422). He first indicates, on the surface, the longitu- dinal fissure and the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius (as above). He then draws two perpendicular lines from his ' base-line ' (that is, a line from the lowest part of the infra-orbital margin through the middle of the external auditory meatus to the back of the head) to the top of the cramum, one (d e, fig. 422) from the depression in front of the Fig. 421.—Drawing to illustrate cranio-cerebral topography. (Macalister.) Taken from a cast prepared by Professor Cunningham. Superior f rontal fissure 5/ external auditory meatus, and the other (f g, fig. 422) from the posterior border of the mastoid process at its root. He has thus described on the surface of the head a four-sided figure (f D G E, fig. 422), and a diagonal line from the posterior superior angle to the anterior perpendicular line where it is crossed by the fissure of Sylvius will represent the furrow. The 2^f'rir'fo-occi2ntal fissure on the upper siu'face of the cerebrum runs outwards at right angles to the great longitudinal fissure for about an inch, from a point ^th of an inch in frowX: of the lambda (posterior fontanelle). Eeid states that if the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius be continued onwards to the sagittal suture, the last inch of this line will indicate the position of the sulcus. The 'precnifrc.J sulcus lies in a line drawn vertically downwards from the point of junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures. It begins four-fifths of an inch in front of the middle of the fissure of Rolando, and extends nearly, but not quite, to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. The superior frontal fissure runs backwards from the supra-orbital notch, parallel with * Lancet, vol. i. 1888, p. 408.707 BASE OF THE BRAIN the line of the longitudmal fissure to |th of an inch in front of the hne indicating the position of the fissure of Kolando. The inferior frontal fissure follows the course of the superior temporal ridge on the frontal bone. The intraioarietal fissure begins on a level with the junction of the middle and lower third of the fissure of Eolando, on a line carried across the head from the back of the root of one auricle to that of the other. After passing upwards, it curves backwards, lying parallel to the longitudinal fissure, midway between it and the parietal eminence ; it then curves downwards to end midway between the posterior fontanelle and the parietal eminence. The under surface of each hemisphere presents a subdivision into three lobes, named, from their position, anterior, middle, and posterior. Fig. 422.—Relation of the principal fissures and convolutions of the cerebrum to the outer surface of the scalp. (Keid.) The anterior or frontal lobe, of a triangular form, with its apex backwards, is somewhat concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the roof of the orbit, being separated from the middle lobe by the fissure of Sylvius. The middle lobe, which is more prominent, is received into the middle fossa of the base of the skull, and comprises the under part of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The posterior or occipital lobe rests upon the tentorium, its extent forwards being limited by the anterior margin of the cerebellum. The various objects exposed to view on the under surface of the cerebrum, in and near the middle line, are here arranged in the order in which they are met with from before backwards. Ceeebeum.

Of these two portions of the longitudinal fissure, that which separates the occipital lobes is the longer. The intermediate portion of the fissure is filled up by the great trans- verse band of white matter, the corpus callosum. In the fissure between the two frontal lobes the anterior cerebral arteries ascend on the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum terminates at the base of the brain by a concave margin, which is connected with the tuber cinereum through the intervention of a thin layer of grey substance, the lamina cinerea. This may be exposed by gently raising Fig. 423.—Base of the brain. Frontal lube Posterior division of Sylvia77 fissure Teviporo- ''lenoida I lobe Occipital lobe and drawing back the optic commissure. A white band may be observed on each side, passing from the under surface of the corpus callosum, backwards and outwards, to the commencement of the fissure of Sylvius : these bands are called the peduncles of the corpus callosum. They may be traced upwards around the genu to become continuous with the strice longituclinales, or nerves of Lancisi, on the upper surface of the corpus callosum (page 712). Laterally, this portion of the corpus callosum extends into the frontal lobe. The lamina cinerea is a thin layer of grey substance, extending backwards above the optic commissure from the termination of the corpus callosum to the tuber cinereum ; it is continuous on each side with the grey matter of the anterior perforated space, and forms the anterior part of the inferior boundary of the third ventricle.BASE OF THE BRAIN The olfactory tract, with its bulb, is seen on each side of the longitudinal fissure upon the under surface of each frontal lobe. The fissure of Sylvius separates the frontal from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and lodges the middle cerebral artery. It begins at the outer side of a depression, at the bottom of which is the anterior perforated space. This depression is called the vallecula Sylvii. At its commencement is seen a point of medullary substance, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres, connecting the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and called the fasciculus unciformis. On following this fissure outwards, it divides into two branches, enclosing portions of the frontal and parietal lobes, which overhang and cover the upper part of a prominent cluster of isolated convolutions called the island of Beil or central lobe. The overhanging portion of the frontal and parietal lobe is called the opercuhmi of the insula. The anterior perforated space is situated at the inner side of the fissure of Sylvius. It is of a triangular shape, bounded, in front, by the orbital convolutions of the frontal lobe and the roots of the olfactory tract; behind, by the optic tract; externally, by the temporo-sphenoidal lobe and commencement of the fissure of Sylvius; internally, it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossed by the peduncle of the corpus callosum. It is of a greyish colour, and corresponds to the under surface of the corpus striatum, a large mass of grey matter, situated in the interior of the brain ; it has received its name from being perforated by numerous minute apertures for the transmission of small straight vessels into the substance of the corpus striatum, constituting the antero-median and antero-lateral ganglionic branches of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The optic commissure is situated in the middle line, immediately in front of the tuber cinereum and below the lamina cinerea.* It is the point of junction between the two optic nerves. Immediately behind the diverging optic tracts, and between them and the peduncles of the cerebrum {crura cerebri), is a lozenge-shaped interval, the inter- peduncular space, in which are found the following parts : the tuber cinereum, infundibulum, pituitary body, corpora albicantia, and the posterior perforated space. The tuber cinereum is an eminence of grey matter, situated between the optic tracts and the corpora albicantia; it is connected with the surrounding parts of the cerebrum, forms part of the floor of the third ventricle, and is continuous with the grey substance in that cavity. From the middle of its under surface a conical tubular process of grey matter, about two lines in length, is continued downwards and forwards, to be attached to the posterior lobe of the pituitary body : this is the infundibulum. Its canal, which is funnel-shaped, communicates with the third ventricle. The pituitary body [hypophysis cerebri) is a small reddish-grey vascular mass, weighing from five to ten grains, and of an oval form, situated in the sella Turcica, in connection with which it is retained by a process of dura mater derived from the inner wall of the cavernous sinus. This process covers in the pituitary fossa, enclosing the pituitary body, and having a small hole in its centre through which the infundibulum passes. Structure.—The pituitary body is very vascular, and consists of two lobes, separated from one another by a fibrous lamina. Of these, the anterior is the larger, of an oblong form, and somewhat concave behind, where it receives the posterior lobe, which is round. The two lobes differ both in development and structure. The anterior lobe, of a dark, yellowish-grey colour, is developed from the ectoderm of the buccal cavity, and resembles to a considerable extent, in micro- scopic structure, the thyroid body. It consists of a number of isolated vesicles and slightly convoluted alveoli, lined by epithelium and united together by connective tissue. The epithelium is columnar and occasionally ciliated. The alveoli some- times contain a colloid material, similar to that found in the thyroid body, and * That is to say, the commissure is superficial to the lamina in the order of dissection when the base is uppermost.NEEVOUS SYSTEM their walls are surrounded by a close network of lymphatics and capillary blood- vessels. The ^posterior lobe is developed by an outgrowth from the embryonic brain, and during foetal life contains a cavity which communicates through the infundibulum with the cavity of the third ventricle. In the adult it becomes firmer and more soUd, and consists of a sponge-like connective tissue arranged in the form of reticulating bundles, between which are branched cells, some of them containing pigment. In the lower animals the two lobes are quite distinct, and it is only in the mammalia that they become connected together. The corpora albicantia, or mammillaria, are two small, round, white masses, each about the size of a pea, placed side by side immediately behind the tuber cinereum. They are formed by the anterior crura of the fornix, hence called the bulbs of the fornix, which, after descending to the base of the brain, are folded upon themselves before passing upwards to the thalami optici. They are composed externally of white substance, and internally of grey matter ; the grey matter of the two being connected by a transverse commissure of the same material. At an early period of foetal life they are blended together into one large mass, but become separated about the seventh month. The posterior perforated space {200ns Tarini) corresponds to a whitish-grey substance placed between the corpora albicantia in front, the pons Varolii behind, and the crura cerebri on each side. It forms the back part of the floor of the third ventricle. It is perforated by numerous small orifices for the passage of the postero-median ganglionic branches of the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries. The crura cerebri (peduncles of the cerebrum) are two thick cylindrical bundles of white matter, which emerge from the anterior border of the pons, and diverge as they pass forwards and outwards to enter the under part of either hemisphere. Each crus is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and somewhat broader in front than behind. They are marked upon their surface with longitudinal stri^, and each is crossed, just before entering the hemisphere, by a flattened white band, the optic tract, which is adherent by its upper border to the peduncle. The third nerve may be seen emerging from a groove on the inner side of each crus, and the fourth nerve winding round its outer side from above. Structure of the Crura.—Each crus consists of a superficial layer of longitudinal white fibres, the crusta, continued upwards from the pons; of a deeper layer, a prolongation of the reticular formation, termed the tegmentum; and of an inter- mediate stratum of grey matter, the locus niger. The crusta, or the superficial layer of longitudinal fibres, consists of coarse bundles of nerve-fibres, which are collected on the under or free surface of the crus. It is formed almost entirely of longitudinal fibres continuous with the pyramidal fibres of the medulla and pons, those derived from the medulla occupying the central portion of the crusta, those added in the pons being placed laterally. The fibres pass to the cerebral hemispheres, entering the internal capsule. The tegmentum forms the deeper part of the crus cerebri, and is united below with its fellow of the opposite side by a prolongation of the septum of the pons; but separated above by the posterior perforated space. It consists of longitudinal bundles of white fibres, interlaced by transverse fibres, together with a quantity of grey raatter with scattered nerve-cells. It forms a well-marked/onwai^io reticularis similar to that found in the pons and medulla, with which it is continuous, receiving, however, a bundle of fibres (superior peduncle) from the cerebellum. Above, the fibres enter the optic thalamus. The locus niger is a mass of grey matter, situated between the crusta and tegmentum, and projecting here and there between the bundles of the former. It is thicker at the inner than at the outer side, and is traversed in its mesial part by the fibres of origin of the third nerve. It contains irregular nerve-cells, in which are lodged numerous dark pigment-granules. The posterior lobes of the cerebrum are concealed from view by the upper surface of the cerebellum and pons Varohi. When these parts are raised, the two711 INTERIOR OF THE CEREBRUM hemispheres are seen to be separated by the great longitudinal fissure, this fissure being interrupted by the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum.

As they ascend, the component fibres of each pass through two large masses of grey matter, the ganglia of the brain, called the thalamiLs opticus and corpus striatum, which project as rounded eminences from the upper and inner side of each peduncle. The hemispheres are connected together, above these masses, by the great transverse commissure, the corpus callosum ; the interval left between its under surface, the upper surface of the ganglia, and the parts closing the inter- peduncular space, forms the general ventricular cavity. The upper part of this cavity is subdivided into two by a vertical septum, the septum lucidum ; and thus the two lateral ventricles are formed. The lower part of the cavity forms the third ventricle, which communicates with the lateral ventricles above, and with the fourth ventricle behind. The fifth ventricle is the interval left between the two layers composing the septum lucidum. Interior of the Cerebrum If the upper part of either hemisphere is removed with a scalpel, about half an inch above the level of the corpus callosum, its internal white matter will be exposed. It is an oval-shaped centre, of white substance, surrounded on all sides by a narrow convoluted margin of grey matter which presents an equal thickness in nearly every part. This white central mass has been called the centrum ovale minus. Its surface is studded with numerous minute red dots {puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided blood-vessels. In inflammation or great congestion of the brain, these are very numerous, and of a dark colour. If the remaining portion of one hemisphere is slightly separated from the other, a broad band of white substance will be observed connecting them, at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure; this is the corpus callosum. The margins of the hemi- spheres which overlap this portion of the brain are called the labia cerebri. Each labium is part of the convolution of the corpus callosum {gyrus fornicatus) already described ; and the space between it and the upper surface of the corpus callosum has been termed the ventricle of the corpus callosum (fig. 427). The hemispheres should now be sliced off, to a level with the corpus callosum, when the white substance of that structure will be seen connecting the two hemispheres. The large expanse of medullary matter now exposed, surrounded by the convoluted margin of grey substance, is called the centrum ovale majus of Vieussens. The corpus callosum is a thick stratum of transverse fibres, exposed at the bottom of the longitudinal fissure. It connects the two hemispheres of the brain, forming their great transverse commissure ; and forms the roof of a space in the interior of each hemisphere, the lateral vejitricle. It is about four inches in length, extending to within an inch and a half of the anterior, and to within two inches and a half of the posterior, part of the brain. It is someAvhat broader behind than in front, and is thicker at either end than in its central part, being thickest behind. It presents a somewhat arched form (fig. 431, 5), from before backwards, terminating anteriorly in a rounded border, which curves, downwards and backwards, between the frontal lobes to the base of the brain. In its course it forms a distinct bend, named the genu, and is then continued downwards and backwards to the base of the brain, where it is connected, through the lamina cinerea, with the tuber cinereum. The reflected portion of the corpus callosum is called the beak or rostrum; it becomes gradually narrower as it descends, and is attached by its lateral margins to the frontal lobes. At its termination the corpus callosum gives off two bundles of white substance, which, diverging fromNERVOUS SYSTEM one another, pass backwards, across the anterior perforated space, to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius. They are called the ijedimcles of the corpus calloswrn. Posteriorly, the corpus callosum forms a thick rounded fold, called the spleniuin or pad, which is free for a little distance, as it curves forwards, and is then continuous with the fornix. On its upper surface, the structure of the corpus callosum is very apparent, being collected into coarse transverse bundles. Along the middle line is a linear depression, the raphe, bounded laterally by two or more slightly elevated longitudinal bands, called the stricE longitudinales or nerves of Lancisi; and, still more externally, other longitudinal strise are seen, beneath the convolutions which rest on the corpus callosum. These are the strice longitudinales laterales or tcenice tectce. The under surface of the corpus callosum is continuous Fig. 424,—Section of the bram. Made on a level with the corpus callosum. behind with the fornix, being separated from it in front by the septum lucidum, which forms a vertical partition between the two ventricles. On each side, the fibres of the corpus callosum extend into the substance of the hemispheres, connecting them together. The greater thickness of the two extremities of this commissure is explained by the fact that the fibres from the anterior and posterior parts of each hemisphere cannot pass directly across, but have to take a curved direction. An incision should now be made throuf^li the corpus callosum, on either side of the raphe, when two large irregular-shaped cavities will be exposed, which extend through a great part of the length of each hemisphere. These are the lateral ventricles. The lateral ventricles are serous cavities, formed by the upper part of the general ventricular space in the interior of the brain. They are Uned by a thin diaphanous lining membrane (the ependyma), covered by nucleated epithelium,LATERAL VENTRICLES 713 with cilia scattered here and there in patches. It is moistened by a serous fluid, which is sometimes, even in health, secreted in considerable quantity. These cavities are two in number, one in each hemisphere, and they are separated from each other by a vertical septum, the septum lucidum. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity, or body, and three smaller cavities or cornua, which extend from it in different directions. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards into the substance of the frontal lobe. The posterior cornu, called the digital cavity, curves backwards into the occipital lobe. The middle cornu descends into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The central cavity, or body of the lateral ventricle, is triangular in form. It is bounded, above, by the under surface of the corpus callosum, which forms the Fig. 425.—The lateral ventricles of the brain. roof of the cavity. Internally is a vertical partition, the sejJtum lucidum, which separates it from the opposite ventricle, and connects the under surface of the corpus callosum with the fornix. Its floor is formed by the following parts, enumerated in their order of position, from before backwards : the corpus striatum, tcenia semicircularis, optic thalamus, choroid plexics, fornix, and commencement of its corpus fimbriatum. The anterior cornu is triangular in form, passing outwards into the frontal lobe, and curving round the anterior extremity of the corpus striatum. It is bounded, above, by the corpus callosum t below and externally, by the corpus striatum ; and in front, by the reflected portion of the corpus callosum. The posterior cornu, or digital cavity, curves backwards into the substance of the occipital lobe, its direction being backwards and outwards, and then inwards'. On its inner wall is seen a longitudinal eminence, which is produced by the714 NERVOUS SYSTEM extension inwards of the calcarine sulcus; this is called the hi2)pocamp2is minor, or calcar avis. Between the middle and posterior horns a smooth eminence is observed, which varies considerably in size in different subjects. It is called the eminentia collateral is. The middle or descending cornu, the largest of the three, traverses the middle lobe of the brain, forming in its course a remarkable curve round the back of the optic thalamus. It passes, at first, backwards, outwards, and downwards, and then curves round the crus cerebri, forwards and inwards, nearly to the point of the middle lobe, close to the fissure of Sylvius. Its upper boundary, or roof, is formed by the fibres of the corpus callosum, passing downwards and outwards into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, with which are incorporated the posterior fibres of the Fig. 426.—Middle part of a horizontal section through the cerebrum at the level of the dotted line in the small figure of one hemisphere. (From Ellis, after Dalton.) nucleus caudatus and taenia semicircularis, which are prolonged into it. Its lower boundary, or floor, presents for examination the following parts : the hippocampus major, pes hippocampi, eminentia collateralis, or p)es accessorius, corpus fimhriatum of the fornix, clwroid plexus, fascia dentata, transverse fissure. The corpus striatum has received its name from the striped appearance which its section presents, in consequence of diverging white fibres being mixed with the grey matter which forms the greater part of its substance. The greater portion of this body is embedded in the white substance of the hemisphere, and is there- fore external to the ventricle. It is termed the extrarentricular portion, or the nucleus lenticularis ; a part, however, is visible in the ventricle and its anterior 'cornu ; this is the intraventricular portion, or the jiucleus caudatus. The intra- ventricular portion is a pear-shaped mass of grey matter; its broad extremity is715 T^NIA SEMICIRCULAEIS directed forwards into the fore part of the body and anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle ; its narrow end is directed outwards and backwards, and lies on the outer side of the optic thalamus, and is continued into the roof of the descending cornu: it is covered by the serous lining of the cavity, and crossed by some veins of considerable size. It is separated from the extraventricular portion by a lamina of white matter, which is called the internal capsule, in contradistinction to a lamina of white matter which covers the outer surface of the extraventricular portion of the corpus striatum, and which is called the external cajjsiile. The internal capsule is formed by fibres of the crusta of the crus cerebri, supplemented by fibres derived from the nuclei on each side. In horizontal section it is seen to be somewhat abruptly curved, with its convexity inwards ; the prominence of the curve is called the genu, and projects between the intraventricular portion of the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus (fig. 426). The extraventricular portion of the corpus striatum, or nucleus lenticularis, is oval in form. It does not extend as far forwards Fig. 427.—Transverse vertical section of the brain, through the fore part of the foramen magnimi, looked at from the front. (iVfter Hirschfeld and Leveille.) Cor or backwards as the nucleus caudatus. It is bounded externally by a lamina of white matter called the external capsule, which is covered on its outer surface by a thin layer of grey matter termed the claustrmn. The claustrum presents ridges and furrows on its outer surface, corresponding to the convolutions and sulci of the island of Reil, with the white matter of which it is in immediate relation. The tgenia semicircularis is a narrow, whitish, semi-transparent band of medullary substance, situated in the depression between the nucleus caudatus and optic thalamus. Anteriorly it descends, in connection with the anterior pillar of the fornix, to below the level of the foramen of Monro, where it enters a mass of grey matter, the nucleus amygdalcB. Behind, it is continued into the roof of the middle or descending horn of the lateral ventricle, and is lost near the bottom of the cornua. Beneath it is a large vein [ vena corporis striati), which receives numerous small veins from the surface of the corpus striatum and optic thalamus, and joins the venas Galeni.7i6 NERVOUS SYSTEM The choroid plexus is a highly vascular, fringe-like membrane, occupying the margin of the fold of pia mater {velum interpositum), in the interior of the brain. It extends, in a curved direction, across the floor of the lateral ventricle. In front, where it is small and tapering, it communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite side, through an oval aperture, the foramen of Monro. Posteriorly, it descends into the middle horn of the lateral ventricle, where it joins with the pia mater through the transverse fissure. In structure, it consists of minute and highly vascular villous processes, composed of large round corpuscles, containing, besides a central nucleus, several yellowish granules and fat molecules, and covered by a single layer of flattened epithelium. The arteries of the choroid plexus enter the ventricle at the descending cornu, and, after ramifying through its substance, send branches into the substance of the brain. The veins of the choroid plexus terminate in the vense Galeni. The corpus fimbriatum (tcenia hijJj^ocamjyi) is a narrow, white, tape-like band, situated immediately behind the choroid plexus. It is the thin lateral edge of the posterior pillar of the fornix, and is attached along the inner border of the hippo- FiG. 428.—Transverse section of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. (From a drawing by Mr. F. A. Barton.) campus major as it descends into the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. It may be traced as far as the crochet or hook of the uncinate convolution. The ojJtic thalamus and fornix will be described on a subsequent page. The middle cornu should now be exposed, throughout its entire extent, by introducing the Httle finger gently into it, and cutting outwards along the finger through the substance of the hemisphere, which should be removed, to an extent sufiicient to expose the entire cavity. The hippocampus major, or cornu Ammonis (fig. 428), so called from its resem- blance to a ram's horn, is a white eminence, of a curved elongated form, extending throughout the entire length of the floor of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle. At its lower extremity it becomes enlarged, and presents a number of roanded elevations with intervening depressions, which, from presenting some resemblance to the paw of an animal, is called the pes hipyocampi. If a transverse section is made through the hippocampus major (fig. 427), it will be seen that this eminence is produced by the extension inwards of the dentate (hippocampal) sulcus717 FOENIX on the exterior of the brain. This sulcus is filled with grey substance, which projects along the free margin of the hippocampus major, forming a notched ridge, the fascia dcntata. The hippocampus is covered on its ventricular surface by a thin lamina of grey matter, which is continuous with the corpus fimbriatum of the fornix. The emiiientia collateralis, or pes accessorius, has already been mentioned, as a white eminence, varying in size, placed between the hippocampus major and hippocampus minor, at the junction of the posterior with the descending cornu. It is formed by the protrusion inwards of the collateral fissure. Fascia dentata.—On separating the inner border of the corpus fimbriatum from the choroid plexus, and raising the edge of the former, a serrated band of grey substance, the edge of the grey substance in the dentate fissure, will be seen beneath it : this is the fascia dentata. Correctly speaking, it is placed external to the cavity of the descending cornu. The transverse fissure is of a horseshoe shape, extending from the end of the descending cornu on one side to the same point on the opposite side. Its horizontal portion (which extends from the commencement of the descending cornu on one side to the same point on the opposite side) is bounded, above, by the splenium, or rounded posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and the fornix ; below% by the corpora quadrigemina, pineal gland, and the posterior extremity of the optic thalamus. Its lateral portions curve downwards, forwards, and inwards, and are bounded above by the crura cerebri and optic thalamus, below by the hippocampus major and the corpus fimbriatum of the fornix. Through this fissure the pia mater passes from the exterior of the brain into the ventricles, to form the velum mterpositum and the choroid plexuses. Where the pia mater projects into the lateral ventricle, beneath the edge of the fornix, it is connected with the lining membrane of these cavities so as to exclude all communication with the exterior of the brain. The septum lucidum (fig. 431, 6) forms the internal boundary of the lateral ventricles. It is a thin, semi-transparent septum, attached, above, to the under surface of the corpus callosum; below, to the anterior part of the fornix; and, in front of this, to the reflected portion of the corpus callosum. It is triangular in form, broad in front, and narrow behind, its surfaces looking towards the cavities of the ventricles. The septum consists of two laminte, separated by a narrow interval, the fifth ventricle. Fifth Ventricle.—The fifth ventricle was originally a part of the great longi- tudinal fissure, which has become shut off by the union of the hemispheres in the formation of the corpus callosum above, and the fornix below. Its walls are there- fore formed by the median wall of the hemispheres, and consist of an internal layer of grey matter, derived from the grey matter of the cortex and an external layer of white substance continuous with the white matter of the cerebral hemi- spheres. This is lined on its external surface by the ependyma of the lateral ventricles. The fifth ventricle is not lined by epithelium. In the foetus, and in some animals, this space communicates, below, with the third ventricle; but in the adult, it forms a separate cavity. In cases of serous eft'usion into the ventricles, the septum is often found softened and partially broken down. The fifth ventricle may be exposed by cutting through the septum and attached portion of the corpus callosum, with scissors : after its examination the corpus callosum should be cut across, towards its anterior part, and the two portions carefully dissected, the one forwards, the other backwards, when the fornix will be exposed. The fornix (figs. 425, 431) is a longitudinal lamella of white fibrous matter, situated beneath the corpus callosum, with which it is continuous behind, but separated in front by the septum lucidum. It may be described as consisting of two symmetrical halves, one for either hemisphere. These two portions are joined together in the middle line, where they form the body, but are separated from one another in front and behind; forming the anterior and jposterior crura. The body of the forn ix is triangular; narrow in front, broad behind. Its7i8 NERVOUS SYSTEM upper surface is connected, in the median line, to the septum lucidum in front, and the corpus callosum behind, while laterally this surface forms part of the floor of each lateral ventricle. Its under surface rests upon the velum interpositum, which separates it from the third ventricle, and the inner portion of the optic thalami. Its outer edge, on each side, is in contact with the choroid plexuses. The anterior crura arch downwards towards the base of the brain, separated from each other by a narrow interval. They are composed of white fibres, which descend through a quantity of grey matter in the lateral walls of the third ventricle, and are placed immediately behind the anterior commissure. At the base of the brain, the white fibres of each crus form a sudden curve upon themselves, and spread out and form the outer part of the corresponding corpus albicans, from Fig. 429.—The fornix, velum interpositum, and middle or descending cornn of the lateral ventricle. which point they may be traced upwards into the substance of the corresponding optic thalamus (fig. 431). The anterior crura of the fornix are connected in their course with the peduncle of the pineal gland and the superficial fibres of the taenia semicircularis, and receive fibres from the septum lucidum. Between the anterior crura or pillars of the fornix and the anterior extremities of the optic thalami, an oval aperture is seen on each side : this is the foramen of Monro (fig. 430). The two openings descend towards the middle line, and lead into the upper part of the third ventricle. Through these openings the lateral ventricles on each side communicate with the third ventricle, and - consequently with each other. The posterior crura, at their commencement, are intimately connected by their upper surfaces with the corpus callosum; diverging from one another, they pass719 THIRD VENTRICLE downwards into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, being continuous with the concave border of the hippocampus major. The lateral thin edges of the posterior crura have received the name of corpus fimhriatum. Upon examining the under surface of the fornix, between its diverging posterior crura, a triangular portion of the under surface of the corpus callosum may be seen. On it are a number of lines : some transverse, others longitudinal or oblique. This portion has been termed the hjra, from the fancied resemblance it bears to the strings of a harp. Divide the fornix across anteriorly, and reflect the two portions, the one forwards, the other backwards, when the velum interpositnm will be exposed. The velum interpositum (fig. 429) is a vascular membrane, a prolongation from the pia mater into the interior of the brain through the transverse fissure, passing beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus callosum and fornix, and above the corpora quadrigemina, pineal gland, and optic thalami. It is of a triangular form, and separates the under surface of the body of the fornix from the cavity of the third ventricle. Its posterior border forms an almost complete investment for the pineal gland. Its anterior extremity, or apex, is bifid ; each bifurcation has attached to it the anterior extremity of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, through the foramen of Monro. On its under surface are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. To its lateral margins are connected the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles. Of the arteries of the velum interpositum, some branches from the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral, enter from behind, beneath the corpus callosum ; another constant branch, the anterior choroid, enters the velum interpositum at the extremity of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle, and supplies this structure and the choroid plexus. The veins of the velum interpositum, the vencB Galcni, two in number, run between its layers ; they are formed by the vense corporis striati and the veins of the choroid plexuses ; the venae Galeni unite posteriorly into a single trunk, which terminates in the straight sinus (fig. 383). The velum interpositum should now be removed. This must be effected carefully, especially at its posterior part, where it invests the pineal gland; the optic thalami will then be exposed with the cavity of the third ventricle between them (fig. 430). The optic thalami are two large oblong masses, placed between the diverging portions of the corpora striata ; they are of a white colour superficially ; internally they are composed chiefly of grey matter. Each thalamus rests upon its correspond- ing crus cerebri, which it embraces. Externally, it is separated from the corpus striatum by the taenia semicircularis. Internally, it forms the lateral boundary of the third ventricle ; and running along its upper and inner border is seen the peduncle of the pineal gland. Its upper surface is free, being partly seen in the lateral ventricle ; it is partially covered by the velum interpositum and fornix, and marked in front by an eminence, the anterior tubercle. Its under surface is united with the tegmentum of the crus cerebri. Its posterior extremity projects above the level of the corpora quadrigemina and crus cerebri, and internally forms a well-marked prominence, the posterior tubercle or ptdvinar, and below and outside this it presents two small rounded eminences, the internal and external geniculate bodies. Its anterior extremity, which is narrow, forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Monro. The Third Ventricle is the narrow oblong fissure placed between the optic thalami, and extending to the base of the brain. It is bounded, above, by the under surface of the velum interpositum, from which are suspended the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. Its floor, somewhat oblique in its direction, is formed, from before backwards, by the parts w^hich are contained in the inter- peduncular space, viz. the lamina cinerea, the tuber cinereum and infundibulum, the corpora albicantia and the locus perforatus posticus, and behind these by the tegmenta of the crura cerebri; its sides are formed by the optic thalami, along the upper and inner border of which are two white tracts, one on each side, the peduncles of the pineal gland. It is bounded, in front, by the anterior crura of the720 NEEVOUS SYSTEM fornix, and part of the anterior commissure ; behind, by the posterior commissure, and the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. The cavity of the third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, named, from their position, antei'ior, middle, and posterior. The anterior commissure is a round bundle of white fibres, placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, and appears to connect together the corpora striati. It passes outwards through the corpus striatum on each side, and then curves backwards into the substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The middle or soft commissure consists almost entirely of grey matter. It connects together the optic thalami, and is continuous with the grey matter lining Fig. 430.—The third and fourth ventricles. An arrow has been placed in the position of the foramen of Monro. the anterior part of the third ventricle. It is frequently broken in examining the brain, and might then be supposed to be wanting. The posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white band of fibres, and appears to connect together the optic thalami posteriorly. It consists of decussating fibres which come from the tegmentum of the crus cerebri on one side, and pass through the optic thalami, across the back part of the third ventricle, to the white substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the other side. Some of the fibres may also serve as commissural fibres between the optic thalami. It bounds the third ventricle posteriorly, above the opening of the Sylvian aqueduct. The pineal gland is placed above it and connected to its upper surface. The third ventricle has four openings connected with it. In front are the two oval apertures of the foramina of Monro, one on each side, through which the721 FORAMEN OF MONRO third communicates with the lateral ventricles. Behind is a third opening leading into the fourth ventricle by a canal, the aqueduct of Sylvius, or iter a tertio ad quartum ventricuhmi. The fourth, situated in the anterior part of the floor of the ventricle, is a deep pit, which leads downwards to the funnel-shaped cavity of the infundibulum {;Uer ad infundihulum). A fifth opening existed in the foetus, which communicated behind with a cavity in the pineal gland. A sixth opening also existed in the foetus, which communicated in front with the fifth ventricle. The lining membrane of the lateral ventricles is continued through the foramen of Monro into the third ventricle, and extends along the iter a tertio ^into the fourth ventricle; at the bottom of the iter ad infundibulum, it ends in a cul-de-sac. The foramen of Monro is a foramen by which each lateral ventricle communi- cates with the third ventricle. It is formed by the anterior extremity of the body Fig. 431.—Vertical median section of the encephalon, showing the parts in the middle line. I. Gonvoliition of the corpus callosum.

Its boundaries are, therefore, in front, the anterior pillars of the fornix ; behind, the anterior extremity of the optic thalamus ; above, the body of the 3 A722 NERVOUS SYSTEM fornix; and below, the groove bet^Yeen the anterior pillars of the fornix and the optic thalamus. Behind the third ventricle, and in front of the cerebellum, are the corpora quadrigemina ; and, resting upon these, the pineal gland. The pineal gland (epiphysis cerebri), so named from its pecuhar shape (pinus, a fir-cone), is a small reddish-grey body, conical in form (hence its synonym, conarium), placed immediately behind the posterior commissure, and between the nates, upon which it rests. It is retained in its position by a duplicature of pia mater, derived from the under surface of the velum interpositum, which almost completely invests it. The pineal gland is about four lines in length, and from two to three in width, at its base, and is said to be larger in the child than in the adult, and in the female than in the male. Its base is connected to the cerebrum by two peduncles (the peduncles of the pineal gland), which pass for- wards upon the upper and inner margin of the optic thalami to the anterior crura of the fornix, with which they become blended; these two peduncles join together at their posterior extremity, in front of the pineal gland, forming a sort of festoon, and the base of the gland is connected to their posterior margin at the point of junction. In front the band of union is joined to the posterior commissure. Structure.—The pineal gland consists of a number of follicles, lined by epithelium, and connected together by ingrowths of connective tissue. The follicles contain a transparent ^dscid fluid, and a quantity of sabulous matter, named acervulus cerebri, composed of phosphate and carbonate of lime, phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, with a little animal matter. These concretions are almost constant in their existence, and are found at all periods of life. When this body is solid, the sabulous matter is found upon its surface, and occasionally upon its peduncles. On the removal of the pineal gland and adjacent portion of pia mater, the corpora quadrigemina are exposed. The corpora or tubercula quadrigemina (optic lobes) are four rounded eminences placed in pairs, two in front, and two behind, and separated from one another by a crucial depression. They are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and posterior commissure, and beneath the posterior border of the corpus callosum. Below, they are separated in the middle line from the crura cerebri by the aqueduct of Sylvius, but on each side are continuous with the tegmentum of the crura. The anterior or upper pair, the nates, are the larger, oblong from before backwards, and of a grey colour. The posterior or lower pair, the testes, are hemispherical in form, and lighter in colour than the preceding. From the outer side of each of these eminences, a prominent white band, termed brachium, is continued forwards and outwards. Those from the nates (brachia anteriora) are the larger, and pass obliquely outw^ards, between the inner and outer geniculate bodies, into the optic tract. Those from the testes (brachia posterior a) pass beneath an oval prominence, the internal geniculate body, and are no longer traceable. Both pairs, in the adult, are quite solid, being composed of white matter externally, and grey matter within. These bodies are larger in the lower animals than in man. In fishes, reptiles, and birds, they are only two in number, are called the optic lobes, from their connection with the optic nerves, and are hollow in their interior; but in mammalia they are four in number, as in man, and quite solid. In the human foetus they are developed at a very early period, and form a large proportion of the cerebral mass; at first they are only two in number, as in the lower vertebrata, and hollow in their interior. These bodies are connected with the cerebellum by means of a large white cord on each side, processus ad testes, or superior peduncles of the cerebellum, which is continued onwards to the optic thalami, through the tegmentum of the crus cerebri. Beneath the corpora quadrigemina, some fibres from it decussate with those of the opposite side across the middle hne.STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM 723 Arching over these peduncles is a flattish band of white fibres, the jiUet, which issues from beneath the transverse fibres of the pons, and in sections of this body can be seen lying between the deep transverse fibres and the reticular formation. If these fibres are traced upwards through the pons, the outer ones will be seen to become superficial at its upper border, to pass obliquely round the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, and become lost in the quadrigeminal body ; while the inner are continued upwards in the crus to the cerebral hemisphere. The corpora geniculata are two small, flattened, oblong masses, placed on the under and back part of each optic thalamus, and named, from their position, corpus geniculatnm externum and internum. The two bodies are separated from one another by one of the roots of the optic tract, the brachia anterior, from the nates. Structure of the Cerebrum The cerebrum, like the other parts of the great nerve-centre, is composed of grey and white matter. In order to give some general idea of its construction, at all events in part, it may be compared, for the sake of illustration, to a tree, the trimk of which divides into two main branches, and these break up into smaller branches, which finally end in twigs to w^hich are attached the leaves, forming an investment to the branches and covering the whole tree. The trunk is represented by the medulla oblongata as it passes through the foramen magnum; the two main branches by the crura cerebri, which break up into smaller branches, which diverge from each other, dividing and subdividing, until they reach the surface of the hemispheres, where they terminate in single nerve-fibres, to which are attached the basal axial cylinder processes of the nerve-cells, represented by the leaves. Thes? cells are arranged on the surface, resembling a cap covering the hemispheres, and constitute the cerebral cortex. But here the analogy ends, for in the cerebrum we have, in addition to this cortex, other masses of grey matter situated in the middle of the brain, and other white fibres beside these diverging ones which have been mentioned, and which serve either to connect the two hemispheres, of which the cerebrum consists, together, or else serve to connect different structures in the same hemisphere. The white matter of the cerebrum consists of medullated fibres, varying in size and arranged in bundles, separated by neuroglia. They may be divided into three distinct systems, according to the course which they take. i. Diverging or peduncular fibres, which connect the hemispheres with the medulla oblongata and cord. 2. Transverse commissural fibres, which connect together the two hemi- spheres. 3. Commissural fibres, which connect different structures in the same hemisphere. I. The diverging or peduncular fibres consist of a main body, which originates ID the cord and medulla oblongata, forms the longitudinal fibres of the pons, and, divides into two main branches, which, diverging from each other, constitute the crura cerebri or cerebral peduncles. In the crura cerebri, as has been before described, the diverging fibres derived from the longitudinal fibres of the pons Varohi are arranged in two strata, which are separated by the locus niger; the anterior or superficial stratum forming the crusta of these bodies, and the posterior or deeper stratum, the tegmentum. The fibres derived from these two sources take a diflerent course, and will have to be separately considered. The fibres of the crusta are derived from the pyramid of the medulla, which fibres are continued upwards through the pons to form the crusta; they are reinforced in their passage through the crus by accessory fibres derived from the central grey matter around the Sylvian aqueduct and from the locus niger. When they emerge from the crus, (i) some of the fibres pass directly upwards as radiating fibres to the grey matter of the cerebral hemisphere, forming the corona radiata ; (2) some of the fibres pass to the internal capsule, between the nucleus caudatus and lenticularis, where they give off fibres to these ganglia and receive others from them, and then, issuing from the capsule, diverge to form a part of the corona radiata, passing to the cerebral cortex. The fibres which arise from the gangliaNEEYOUS SYSTEM 724 are more numerous than those which terminate in the gangUa, so that more fihres pass out of the gangha than pass into them. The fibres of the tegmentum are continuous with those longitudinal fibres of the pons which are derived from the formatio reticularis of the medulla, which is formed by fibres (i) from the anterior column of the cord ; (2) from the olivary body; (3) from the lateral column of the cord; and (4) from the funiculus cuneatus and funiculus gracilis. They are reinforced by fibres from the corpora quadrigemina and corpora geniculata, and from the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, and enter the optic thalamus. Some of these fibres pass through the optic thalamus, and, being augmented by other fibres arising within this body, pass out of it and spread out to form part of the corona radiata, especially joining the ganglion-cells of the cortex of the temporo-sphenoidal and occipital lobes ; other fibres terminate in the optic thalamus. 2. The transverse commissural fibres connect together the two hemispheres. They include: (a) the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum; [h) the anterior commissure ; (c) the posterior commissure. The corjms callosum, which has already been described, connects together the two hemispheres of the brain, forming their great transverse commissure, pene- trating into the substance of the convolutions and intersecting the fibres of the corona radiata. The anterior commissure is a round bundle of white fibres, which is placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, and appears to connect the corpora striata. It passes outwards through the corpus striatum on each side, and then curves backwards into the substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The posterior commissure, smaller than the anterior, is a flattened white band of fibres, which appears to connect together the optic thalami posteriorly. It consists of decussating fibres which come from the tegmentum of the crus cerebri on one side, and pass through the optic thalamus, across the back part of the third ventricle, to the white substance of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the other. Some of the fibres may also serve as commissural fibres between the optic thalami. 3. Commissural fibres connecting' different structures in the same hemisphere.— These fibres are of two kinds : (i) those which connect adjacent convolutions, and which are termed arcuate or association fihres ; (2) those which connect more distant parts in the same hemisphere—the longitudinal or collateral fihres. The arcuate or association fihres are situated immediately beneath the grey substance of the cortex of the hemispheres, and connect together adjacent con- volutions. The longitudinal or collateral fihres include the following: {a) the uncinate fasciculus; (h) the fillet of the gyrus fornicatus ; (c) the longitudinal fibres of the corpus callosum; {d) the taenia semicircularis ; (e) the fornix; (/) the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. ia) The uncinate fascicuhis connects the convolutions of the frontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes. It passes across the bottom of the Sylvian fissure and traverses the claustrum. (h) The fillet of the gyrus fornicatus is a band of white matter, which encircles the hemisphere in an antero-posterior direction, lying in the substance of the con- volution of the corpus callosum. Commencing in front at the anterior perforated space, it passes forwards and upwards parallel with the rostrum, winds round the genu, runs in the convolution from before backwards, immediately above the corpus callosum, turns round its posterior extremity, and is continued downwards and forwards in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe to again reach the perforated space. In its course it is connected with the secondary convolutions of the gyrus fornicatus by short arcuate fibres. (c) The longitudinal fihres of the corjnis callosum or nerves of Lancisi connect the anterior and posterior extremities of the gyrus fornicatus or convolution of the corpus callosum. (a) The tcEnia semicircularis is a narrow whitish semitransparent band ofSTKUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM 725 Fig. 432.—Grey matter of the cerebral cortex. (Meynert.) medullary substance, situated in the depression between the nucleus caudatus and the optic thalamus. Anteriorly, it descends in connection with the anterior pillar of the fornix to below the level of the foramen of Monro, where it enters a mass of grey matter, the nucleus amygdalce ; behind, it is continued into the roof of the middle or descending horn of the lateral ventricle, and is lost near the bottom of the cornua. (e) The/orm'x connects the optic thalamus with the hippocampus major and uncinate convolution. It has already been de- scribed as arising from the grey matter of the optic thalamus; it then emerges from the under surface of this body, forms the corpus albicans, where the fibres are arranged in loops, between which nerve-cells are to be found; it then passes upwards into the third ventricle and joins with the fibres of the other side forming the body of the fornix ; from this the posterior pillars diverge and, entering the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle, part of its fibres are distributed to the hippocampus major, and the remainder end as the taenia hippocampi or fimbria, which is continued as a distinct piece to the crochet or uncus of the uncinate convolution. (/) The inferior longitudinal fasciculus is a collection of fibres which connects the temporo- sphenoidal and occipital lobes, running along the outer wall of the middle and posterior cornu. The grey matter of the cerebrum is disposed in three great groups :—i. The grey matter of the cerebral cortex. 2. The grey matter of the basal ganglia, that is, the great ganglia of the base of the cerebrum. 3. The grey matter which lines the internal surface of the upper part of the cerebro- spinal tube, that is, the remains of the cavity in the original vesicles from which the brain was formed, and which constitutes the central cavities of the organ. I. The grey matter of the cortex (fig. 432) invests the surface of the hemispheres and gives them external form. When vertical sections are made through it, and examined microscopically, it is found to consist of five separate layers, but to this there are some exceptions. According to Meynert these exceptions are to be found: (i) in the posterior portion of the occipital lobe ; (2) in the grey cortex of the hippocampus major; (3) in the wall of the fissure of Sylvius ; and (4) in the olfactory bulb. The five layers in the common type are as follows : (i) The first layer is principally ' composed of a matrix or neuroglia, through which a few small ganglion-cells are irregularly distributed, and a nerve-fibre network. (2) The second layer consists of numerous small pyramidal cells, which have their long axes vertical to the surface of the convolutions, and are closely aggregated together so as to completely fill the layer with a number of closely compressed cells. (3) The third layer is named by Meynert the' formation of the cornu Ammonis, as it is made up of cells, which are the only morphological element found in this part. It consists of the same sort of pyramidal cells, arranged vertically to the surface, as was found in the preceding layer, but they are of very m.uch larger726 NERVOUS SYSTEM size, and increase progressively towards the deeper parts of the layer, and they are much more widely separated from each other. This layer is the principal and broadest one of the series, and is at least twice as deep as the preceding layer. (4) The fourth layer is termed the granular forviation by Meynert, and consists of numerous small, irregular, rarely triangular or elongated, cells, which resemble the nerve-corpuscles found in the internal granule layer of the retina, and which are closely aggregated together. (5) The fifth layer is termed the claustral formation, and consists of a very large proportion of spindle-shaped cells, which are the peculiar elements of this layer. They are especially numerous in the inner half, and are arranged horizontally, extending parallel to the surface. They have received their name from the fact that the claustrum is made up almost entirely of an accumulation of these cells. It will be seen, therefore, that the differences in these layers depend upon the varying form and size of the cells and the closeness of their arrangement, and that the typical form of cell, and the only one which is admitted by some observers, is the pyramidal cell or nerve-corpuscle. Character of the pyramidal cell or nerve-corpuscle.—These nerve-corpuscles ^re destitute of a cell wall; they present a nucleus, sometimes round or oval, sometimes angular, and give off many processes. One of these, which, in the cells arranged vertically to the surface, projects outwards and is named ih.Q process of the apex, is strong and branched, and according to Cleland is continuous with the nerve-fibre network in the first or superficial layer of the cortex. Another process projects inwards towards the white matter of the hemisphere and from the opposite extremity of the cell. It is termed the process of the centre of the base. It is more slender than the preceding and remains unbranched. It is an axis-cylinder process, and, becoming invested with a medullary sheath, constitutes a nerve-fibre, extending into the central white matter. In addition to these, lateral processes are given off, forming the processes of the basal angle, which can be traced for a longer or shorter distance, and break up into a network of extremely minute nerve-fibres. Special types of the grey matter of the cortex.—The special types of grey matter of the cortex are the following : (i) On the posterior portion of the occipital lobe the grey matter consists of eight layers. This is produced by the intercalation of intermediate granule layers, similar to those forming the fourth layer of the typical cortex. (2) In the grey matter of the cortex of the hippocampus major or cornu Ammonis, pyramidal cells are alone found, such as have been described in the third layer of the typical cortex. This constitutes the greater part of the structure in this situation, the fourth and fifth layers being absent, and the second layer containing no cells. (3) In the wall of the Sylvian fissure the grey matter is termed the claustrum; it separates the white matter of the convolutions of the island of Reil from the external capsule of the corpus striatum. This presents peculiarities of structure, consisting mainly of spindle-shaped cells, such as consti- tute the fifth layer. (4) In the olfactory bulb, which may be regarded as a portion of the cerebral hemispheres, forming 'a cap superimposed upon a conical process of the cerebrum,' is another variety of structure, differing from the type of the cortex of the hemispheres. The bulb consists of both grey and white matter, and sometimes retains a central cavity lined by epithelium. The lower part is grey matter, and consists of the following layers from below upwards, (i) The olfactory nerve-layer, consisting of a layer of non-medullated nerve-fibres derived from the nerves which supply the olfactory region. (2) The stratum glomerulosum, consisting of nodulated masses, containing small nuclear cells, and a convoluted olfactory nerve-fibre amongst the cells. (3) The stratum gelatinosum, consisting of pyramidal or spindle-shaped nerve-cells and a fine network of nerve-fibre. (4) The granular layer, consisting of small irregular nerve-cells resembling the fourth layer of the cerebrum or the granular layer of the retina. 2. The grey matter of the basal ganglia.—The great ganglia of the base of the brain are, the corpus striatum, the optic thalamus, the corpora quadrigemina, the corpora geniculata, and the locus niger. Only a part, however, of the grey727 STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM matter of the corpora quadrigemina—that found on the periphery of this body— belongs to this group; the remainder, that contained in its centre around the Sylvian aqueduct, belongs properly to the third group, which will be discussed immediately. The corpus striatum presents two distinct and separate masses, the nucleus caudatus, which is the intraventricular portion of the corpus striatum, and Lhe nucleus lenticularis, which is the extraventricular portion. The two are separated from each other by a distinct lamina of white matter, the internal capsule, which also separates the nucleus lenticularis from the outer part of the optic thalamus. The grey matter of the corpus striatum is permeated by tracts of medullated nerve- fibres, some of which probably originate in it, though the actual connection of the nerve-fibres with the cells has not been demonstrated. The nerve-cells are multi- polar, both large and small, the larger being principally found in the lenticular nucleus. The optic thalamus is chiefly formed of grey matter, covered over by a super- ficial layer of white, which on the outer side separates it from the internal capsule. The grey matter is arranged in two masses, the outer and inner nuclei, partially divided by a vertical white septum. It is traversed by numerous nerve-fibres, which for the most part have no definite direction; some, however, converge and form a bundle which passes downwards to form the anterior root of the fornix. It contains comparatively large nerve-cells, both multipolar and fusiform. The inner nucleus is connected across the middle line with the inner nucleus of the opposite side by the middle commissure of the third ventricle, which, however, belongs to the third group of grey matter. The corpora quadrigemina consist of two distinct and separate collections of grey matter, one at or near the surface, which belongs to the basal ganglia, and one in the centre around the aqueduct of Sylvius. The former will only be considered at present. The peripheral grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina ^differs somewhat in the posterior and anterior lobes. The posterior lobes or testes are composed almost entirely of grey matter, covered over by a thin stratum of white matter, and separated from the central grey matter by tracts of transverse white fibres derived from, and forming part of, the fillet. The anterior lobes or nates are covered superficially by a thin stratum of white matter; beneath this is a layer of grey matter, termed the stratum cinereum, and consisting, as well as the grey matter of the posterior lobes, of small multipolar cells embedded in a fine network of nerves. Beneath this again is a characteristic mass of grey matter, termed the stratum opticum, which is made up of fine nerve-fibres, coursing in a longitudinal direction, and containing between them small masses of grey substance, consisting of small multipolar nerve-cells embedded in grey matter. Lastly, between this body and the central grey matter around the Sylvian aqueduct is a thin lamina of white matter, derived from the fillet. The geniculate bodies are continuous with the grey substance of the optic thalamus, and the external one [corpus geniculatum externum) is peculiar on account of its dark colour, due to its cells containing pigment. It presents a laminated arrangement, and consists of alternate thick layers of grey matter and thin layers of white matter. Its cells are multipolar. The internal body {corpus geniculatum internum) is of lighter colour, does not present a laminated arrangement, and its cells are smaller in size and fusiform in shape. The locus niger, or grey matter of the crus cerebri, like the external geniculate body, is peculiar from the large amount of dark pigment-granules which are contained in its ganglion-cells, and which give to it its dark colour, from which it has derived its name. Its cells are small and multipolar. 3. The central grey matter of the cerebrum lines the upper part of the cerebro-spinal tube, which is the remains of the cavity in the original vesicles from which the brain was formed, and is continuous with the grey matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and through it with the grey matter of the cord. This central grey matter is found lining the aqueduct of Sylvius, by which the third communi-728 NEEVOUS SYSTEM cates with the fourth ventricle ; it covers the inner wall of each optic thalamus, forming the middle or grey commissure of the third ventricle; it also lines the floor of the third ventricle; it covers behind the upper surface of the tegmentum of the crus, and in front it approaches the surface of the brain, forming the posterior perforated space and the lamina cinerea. It forms also the tuber cinereum and the infundibulum, and in the lower vertebrata, especially fishes, the posterior lobe of the pituitary body. In the higher vertebrates this lobe does not present any nervous structure, being encroached upon and obliterated by an ingrowth of connective tissue and vessels. The grey matter surrounding the Sylvian aqueduct, which has been before mentioned as the central grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina, presents some features requiring especial mention. It forms a tolerably thick layer surrounding the canal, but is thicker on the lower wall; that is, below the canal, than above. The cells, which are multipolar, are here collected into groups, and form nuclei for the origin of the third and fourth cranial nerves. The nucleus for the third and fourth consists of a column of cells of large size on either side of, and close to, the median line. In addition to these cells there are found at the periphery of the zone of grey matter surrounding the aqueduct, some other, and larger, cells: sometimes single, sometimes grouped in twos or threes, or even more. They are globular and lie in the midst of well-marked nerve-fibres, with which their processes appear to be continuous. The Cerebellum The Cerebellum, or little brain, is that portion of the encephalon which is contained in the inferior occipital fossae. It is situated beneath the occipital lobes of the cerebrum, from which it is separated by the tentorium. In form, the cerebellum is oblong, and flattened from above downwards, its great diameter being from side to side. It measures from three and a half to four inches trans- versely, and from two to two and a half inches from before backwards, being about two inches thick in the centre, and about six lines at the circumference, which is the thinnest part. It consists of grey and white matter : the former, darker than that of the cerebrum, occupies the surface ; the latter, the interior. The surface of the cerebellum is not convoluted like the cerebrum, but traversed by numerous curved furrows or sulci, which vary in depth at different parts, and separate the laminae of Avhich its exterior is composed. Weig^ht of the Cerebellum.—Its average weight in the male is 5 ozs. 4 drs. It attains its maximum weight between the twenty-fifth and fortieth year ; its increase in weight after the fourteenth year being relatively greater in the female than-in the male. The proportion between the cerebellum and cerebrum is, in the male, as I to 8^ ; and in the female, as i to 8}. In the infant, the cerebellum is propor- tionately much smaller than in the adult, the relation between it and the cerebrum being, according to Chaussier, between i to 13, and i to 26 ; by Cruveilhier the proportion was found to be i to 20. Lobes of the Cerebellum.—The cerebellum is divided into an upper and a lower portion by the great horizontal fissure, which commences in front at the pons, and passes horizontally round the free margin of the hemisphere, to the middle line behind. From this primary fissure numerous secondary fissures proceed, which separate the cerebellum into lobes. Its upper surface (fig. 433) is somewhat elevated in the median line, and sloped towards its circumference; it consists of two lateral hemispheres, connected together by an elevated median portion or lobe, the superior vermiform process. The median lobe is the fundamental part, and in some animals, as fishes and reptiles, the only part which exists ; the hemispheres being additions, and attaining their maximum size in man. The hemispheres are separated, in front, by a deep notch, the incisura cerebelli anterior, which encircles the posterior part of the corpora quadrigemina; they are also separated by a similar notch behind,CEEEBELLUM the incisura cerehelli ]Josterior, in which is received the upper part of the falx cerebelli. The superior vermiform process (upper part of the median lobe of the cerebellum) extends from the notch on the anterior to that on the posterior border. Upon the upper surface of each hemisphere there are two lobes, separated from each other by a fissure. These are the anterior or square lobe, which extends as Fig. 433.—Upper surface of the cerebellum. far back as the posterior edge of the vermiform process; and the ^posterior or semilunar lohe, which passes from the termination of the preceding to the great horizontal fissure. The under surface of the cerebellum (fig. 434) is subdivided into two lateral hemispheres by a depression, the vallecula or valley, which extends from before backwards in the middle line. These lateral hemispheres are lodged in the inferior Fig. 434.—Under surface of the cerebellum. occipital fossae ; the median depression, or valley, receives the back part of the medulla oblongata, is broader in the centre than at either extremity, and has projecting from its floor part of the median lobe of the cerebellum, called the inferior vermiform process. Upon the under surface of each hemisphere there are five lobes, separated by sulci; these are, from before backwards : (i) the flocculus or subpecluncular lobe, a730 NERVOUS SYSTEM prominent tuft, situated behind and below the middle peduncle of the cerebellum ; its surface is composed of grey matter, subdivided into a few small laminae ; it is sometimes called the pneumogastric lobule, from being situated behind the pneumo- gastric nerve : (2) the amygdala or tonsil, situated on either side of the great median fissure or valley, and projecting into the fourth ventricle : (3) the digastric lobe, situated on the outside of the tonsil, and connected in part with the pyramid: (4) the slender lobe, behind the digastric, and connected with the back part of the pyramid and the commissura brevis : and more posteriorly (5) the inferior ijosterior lobe, which also joins the commissura brevis in the valley. The inferior vermiform process.—The parts entering into the composition of the inferior vermiform process, from behind forwards, are : the tuber valvulce or commissura brevis, a transverse lamina uniting the inferior posterior, and slender lobes of the two sides ; in front of this, a laminated conical projection, the ijyramid \ more anteriorly, a larger eminence, the uvula, which is placed between two rounded lobes, the amygdales or tonsils, which occupy the sides of the valley, and which is connected with them by a commissure of grey matter, indented on the surface, called the furrotved band. In front of the uvula is the nodule ; it is the anterior pointed termination of the inferior vermiform process, and projects into the cavity of the fourth ventricle; it has been named by Malacarne the laminated tubercle. Fig. 435.—Vertical section of the cerebellum. On each side of the nodule is a thin layer of white substance, attached externally to the flocculus, and internally to the nodule; these form together the iwsterior medullary velum, or commissure of the flocculus. It is usually covered in and concealed by the amygdalae, and cannot be seen until they are drawn aside. This band is of a semilunar form on each side, its anterior margin being free and concave, its posterior attached just in front of the furrowed band. Between it and the nodule and uvula behind is a deep fossa, called the sioallow's nest {nidus Jiirundinis). Internal structure of the cerebellum.—The cerebellum consists both of white and grey matter. If a vertical section (fig. 435) is made through either hemisphere of the cere- bellum, midway between its centre and the superior vermiform process, the interior will be found to consist of a central stem of white matter, which contains in its interior a grey mass, the corpus 'dentatum. From the surface of this central stem a series of plates of medullary matter are detached, which, covered with grey matter, form the laminae. From the anterior part of each hemisphere arise three large processes or peduncles—superior, middle, and inferior—by which the cerebellum is connected with the rest of the encephalon.731 CEREBELLUM The white matter includes two varieties of nerve matter: (i) the pechmcular fibres, which are directly continuous with the fibres of the peduncles of the cerebellum ; (2) the fibres (fibrce proprice) proper to the cerebellum itself. The peduncles of the cerebellum—superior, middle, and inferior—serve to connect it with the rest of the encephalon. The superior pedimcles (processus e cerebello ad testes) arise from the middle of the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres; they run beneath the testes of the corpora quadrigemina and, emerging at its posterior border, pass outwards and backwards to the cerebellum. Each peduncle forms the upper part of the lateral boundary of the fourth ventricle, and is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by the valve of Vieussens. Beneath the corpora quadrigemina the innermost fibres of each peduncle decussate with each other, so that some fibres from the one half of the cerebrum are continued into the other half of the cerebellum. Upon entering the cerebellum the fibres of this peduncle pass to a great extent into the interior of the corpus dentatum, though some wind round it and reach the grey cortical matter, especially on its inferior surface. The valve of Vieussens, or superior medullary velum, is a thin translucent lamina of white matter, marked superficially by a few transverse streaks of grey substance, stretched between the two processus e cerebello ad testes ; it forms part of the roof of the fourth ventricle. It is narrow in front, where it is connected with the testes ; and broader behind, at its connection with the vermiform process of the cerebellum. A slight elevated ridge, the frcenulum, descends upon the upper part of the valve from the corpora quadrigemina, and on either side of it may be seen the fourth nerve, which is connected with its fellow of the opposite side by a transverse band of fibres forming a partial decussation. Its lower half is covered by a thin, transversely-grooved lobule of grey matter prolonged from the anterior border of the cerebellum; this is called the lingula. The middle peduncles [processus ad pontem), the largest of the three, connect together the two hemispheres of the cerebellum, forming their great transverse commissure. They consist of a mass of curved fibres, which arise in the grey matter of the foliated cortex of the hemispheres of the cerebellum, and pass across the pons Varolii, forming its transverse fibres. The inferior peduncles (processus ad medullam) connect the cerebellum with the medulla oblongata. As the restiform bodies, they pass upwards and outwards, forming part of the lateral wall of the fourth ventricle; entering the cerebellum, they end in the grey cortex of the upper surface of this organ. TYiQ fibrcB propricB of the cerebellum are of two kinds: (i) commissural fibres, which cross the middle line to connect the opposite halves of the hemispheres, some at the anterior part, and others at the posterior part of the vermiform process ; (2) arcuate or association fibres, which connect one lamina with another, arching across the fissures betAveen the laminae. The grey matter of the cerebellum is found in two situations : (i) on the surface, forming the cortex ; (2) as independent masses in the interior. I. The grey matter of the cortex presents a characteristic foliated appearance, due to the series of laminae which are given off from the central white matter; these laminae give off secondary laminae which are covered with grey matter. This arrangement gives to the cut surface of the organ a foliated appearance, to which the name arbor vitce has been applied (fig. 435). Externally the cortex is covered by pia mater, and internally is the medullary centre consisting mainly of nerve- fibres. Microscopical appearance of the cortex.—The cortex presents a remarkable structure, consisting of two distinct layers, viz. an external grey or cellular layer and an internal rust-coloured granular layer. Between the two layers, or rather situated in the deepest part of the grey or cellular layer, is an incomplete stratum of the characteristic cells of the cerebellum, the corpuscles of Purkinje. The external grey or cellular layer (fig. 436) consists of a transparent tissue- like neuroglia, containing fibres and cells. The fibres are delicate fibrillae runningNERVOUS SYSTEM at ric^ht anc^les to the surface, and many of them connected ^vith the processes of the larcre nerve-cells immediately below : others are dehcate supporting connective tissue-like tibres, which spread out into a broad base against the inner surface of the pia mater. , y , ■ i The cells are granular bodies, some very small, and probably belongmg to the neuro^ha: others", according to Lockhart Clarke, connected with the processes of the corp^^scles of Purkinje which he immediately beneath. The corpuscles of Purkinje (fig. 436) are flask-shaped cells, in the deepest part Y^c.. 456.—Vertical section through the gi'ey matter of the Imman cerebellum. Mat^nified about 100 diameters.

From their under service a shght slender process arises, which passes through the internal layer, and becomes continuous with the axial cylinder of a meduUated nerve-fibre in the medullary substance beneath. From the other extremity two peripheral processes are given oft', which branch in an antler-like manner in the external layer, some of the finer processes becoming connected with the cells in this layer. The infernal or rust-coloured layer (fig. 436) is characterised by containing multitudes of granttlar-looking bodies embedded in a gelatinous matrix. They are minute stellate cells, consisting of a well-defined nucleus with a thin protoplasmic733 FOURTH VEXTRICLE enrelope. Between the cells is a fine nerve-network, with whic-h the processes of the cells are supposed to be continuous. 2. The independent centres of grey matter in the Fig. 437. A corpuscle of Pnr- cereheUum are : (i) the corpus dentatum ; (2) the roof nuclei of Stilling. The corpus dentatum or ganglion of tlie cere- helium is situated a little to the inner side of the centre of the stem of white matter. It consists of an open bag or capsule of grey matter, the section of which presents a grey dentated outline, open at its anterior part. It is surrounded by white fibres ; white fibres are also contained in its interior which issue from it to join the superior peduncles. The roof nuclei of Stilling are two small grey masses, situated at the anterior end of the superior vermiform process, and projecting into the valve of Yieussens, so as to assist in the formation of the roof of the fourth ventricle. These can only be seen in microscopic preparations. Fourth Venteicle (fig. 430) The Fourth. Ventricle, or ventricle of the cerehelhtm, is the space between the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons in front and the cerebellum behind. It is lozenge- or diamond-shaped ; that is to say, it is composed of two triangles, with their bases opposed to each other. The lower triangle is formed by the divergence of the funiculi graciles and the restiform bodies of the medulla oblongata on either side. These columns pass upwards and outwards at an acute angle to the lateral hemispheres of the cerebellum, leaving by their divergence a triangular space, which forms the lower half of the fourth ventricle. In like manner the upper triangle is formed by the divergence of the superior peduncles (processus e cerebello ad testes) of the cerebellum. These crura as they emerge from the corpora quadrigemina are in contact by their lateral margins, but they gradually diverge, passing downwards, backwards, and outwards, to reach the cerebellum, thus enclosing a triangular space, which forms the upper half of the fourth ventricle. This cavity is therefore bounded laterally by the processus e cerebello ad testes above, and by the diverging funiculi graciles and restiform bodies below. It presents four angles. The upper angle reaches as high as the upper border of the pons; it presents the lower opening of the aqueduct of Sylvius, by which this ventricle communicates with the third ventricle. The lower angle is on a level with the lower border of the olivary body, and presents a minute opening— the aperture of the central canal of the spinal cord. At its lateral angles the fourth ventricle is extended for a short distance between the side of the medulla and the cerebellum, where these two structures come in contact. The roof is arched, and is formed in the upper triangle by part of the superior peduncles of the cerebellum and the valve of Vieussens (superior medullary velum) —a lamina of white matter streaked with grey, which bridges across from one superior peduncle to the other. The roof of the lower half is formed by a reflection of pia mater passing from the under surface of the inferior vermiform process of the cerebellum to the lower part of the medulla oblongata. Above this is the inferior vermiform process itself. This pia-matral covering is lined on its under or ventricular surface by a layer of epithelium, which is continuous with that lining the sides and base of the cavity, and is perforated by a hole, the foramen of Majendie, by which the cavity of the ventricle communicates with the sub- arachnoidean space. The floor is formed by the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons. kinje, with its dichotom- ously branched processes.NERVOUS SYSTEM 734 In the median line is seen a fissure which gradually becomes obliterated above, and terminates below, near the point of the calamus scriptorius, in a somewhat cleft- like space, the ventricle of Arantius, which opens by a minute hole into the central canal of the spinal cord. From the resemblance that there is in the diverging lower boundaries of the space and the central fissure to the nib of a writing-pen, the lower triangle has been named the calamus scriptorius. On each side of the median fissure are two spindle-shaped longitudinal eminences, the fascicidi teretes ; they extend the entire length of the floor, being indistinct below and of a greyish colour, but Avell marked and whiter above. Each eminence consists of a portion of the base of the anterior cornu of grey matter of the medulla, which comes to the surface of the floor of the fourth ventricle where the central canal of the spinal cord opens out into this cavity. External to this eminence there is a slight groove which terminates below in a little fossa, called the fovea inferior.; and in the same groove, opposite the widest part of the ventricle, there is a second depression or fossa, called the fovea superior. Above the superior fovea, and external to the fasciculi teretes, is a small eminence of dark grey substance, which presents a bluish tint through the thin stratum covering it; this is called the locus ccEruleus ; and a thin streak of the same colour continued up from this on either side of the fasciculi teretes, as far as the top of the ventricle, is called the tania violacea. The lower part of the floor of the ventricle is crossed by several white transverse lines, linecB transverscB or auditory strict ; they emerge from the posterior median fissure and enter the roots of origin of the auditory nerve. The lining membrane of the fourth ventricle is continuous with that of the third, through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and its cavity communicates below with the subarachnoidean space of the brain and cord through an aperture in the layer of pia mater extending between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Laterally, this membrane is reflected outwards a short distance between the cerebellum and medulla. The choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle are two in number: they are delicate vascular fringes, which project into the ventricle on each side, passing from the point of the inferior vermiform process to the outer margin of the restiform bodies. The grey matter in the floor of the ventricle consists of a tolerably thick stratum, continuous below with the grey commissure of the cord, and extending up as high as the aqueduct of Sylvius ; and, in addition, of some special deposits connected with the deep origin of certain of the cranial nerves. These special deposits produce little elevations on the floor of the ventricle. The nucleus of the fifth is placed the highest; the deep origin of the larger or sensory root is from a nucleus on a level with the middle of the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, just internal to the margin of the ventricle ; the deep origin of the smaller root is from a nucleus internal to the sensory root, and just external to the fasciculus teres on the floor of the ventricle. The origin of the sixth is a little lower than the motor root of the fifth, and close to the median line beneath the anterior portion of the fasciculus teres. The deep origin of the seventh, or facial, is a little below and external to the nucleus of the sixth, above the level of the auditory stride. The deep origin of the eighth, or auditory, is two-fold : one from a prominence, the auditory tubercle, on the outer side of the inferior fovea ; the other is situated at the lateral angle of the ventricle. Into this latter run the auditory striae. The deep origin of the ninth, or glosso-pharyngeal, is from a nucleus of grey matter at the lower part of the ventricle, beneath the inferior fovea, below the inner nucleus of the eighth or auditory nerve. The deep origin of the tenth, or pneumogastric, is from a nucleus of grey matter at the lower part of the ventricle, below and continuous with the nucleus of origin of the ninth or giosso-pharyngeal nerve. The deep origin of the eleventh or accessory portion of the spinal accessory is735 CRANIAL NERVES from a nucleus of grey matter at the back of the medulla, extending from the level of the top of the calamus scriptorius as far down as the interniedio-lateral tract of the spinal cord. The deep origin of the twelfth, or hypoglossal, is from a nucleus of grey matter on the floor of the ventricle, on either side of the middle line extending from the level of the auditory stride to the lowest point of the ventricle of Arantius. CRANIAL NERVES The cranial nerves arise from some part of the cerebro-spinal centre, and are transmitted through foramina in the base of the cranium. They have been named numerically, according to the order in which they pass through the dura mater lining the base of the skull. Other names are also given to them derived from the parts to which they are distributed, or from their functions. Taken in their order, from before backwards, they are as follows :— ist. Olfactory. yth. Facial (Portio dura). 2nd. Optic. 8th. Auditory (Portio mollis). 3rd. Motor oculi. 9th. Glosso-pharyngeal. 4th. Pathetic. loth. Pneumogastric (Par vagum). 5th. Trifacial (Trigeminus). nth. Spinal accessory. 6th. Abducent. 12th. Hypoglossal. All the cranial nerves are connected to some part of the surface of the brain. This is termed their superficial or ayiKvrent origin. But their fibres may, in all cases, be traced deeply into the substance of the brain to some special centre of grey matter, termed a nucleus. This is called their deep or real origin. The nerves, after emerging from the brain at their apparent origin, pass through foramina or tubular prolongations in the dura mater, leave the skull through foramina in its base, and pass to their final distribution. First Neeve (fig. 423, page 708) The First Cranial or Olfactory Nerves, the special nerves of the sense of smell, are abcait twenty in number. They are given off from the under surface of the olfactory bulb, an oval mass of a greyish colour, which rests on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and forms the anterior expanded extremity of a slender process of brain-substance, named the olfactory tract (see page 709). The olfactory tract, when traced backwards, divides into three slips or roots at its base. The middle root is attached to the under surface of the frontal lobe, just in front of the anterior perforated space. The external root passes outwards, round the anterior perforated space, across the fissure of Sylvius to the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The internal root passes inwards, and joins the lower end of the corpus callosum. These three roots unite, and form a flat band, narrower in the middle than at either extremity, and of a somewhat prismoid form on section. It is soft in texture and contains a considerable amount of grey matter in its substance. As it passes forwards, it is contained in a deep sulcus, the olfactory sulcus, between two convolutions, lying on the under surface of the frontal lobe, on either side of the longitudinal fissure, and is retained in position by the arachnoid membrane which covers it. On reaching the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, it expands into the olfactory bulb. From the under part of this bulb are given off the olfactory nerves, which pass through the cribriform foramina, and are distributed to the mucous membrane of the nose. Each nerve is surrounded by a tubular prolonga- tion from the dura mater and pia mater ; the former being lost on the periosteum lining the nose; the latter, in the neurilemma of the nerve. The nerves, as they736 NERVOUS SYSTEM enter the nares, are divisible into three groups : an inner group, larger than those on the outer wall, spread out over the upper third of the septum ; a middle set, confined to the roof of the nose ; and an outer set, which are distributed over the superior and middle turbinated bones, and the surface of the ethmoid in front of them. As the filaments descend, they unite in a plexiform network, and are believed by most observers to terminate in the cells of SchuUze. The olfactory differs in structure from other nerves, in being composed exclusively of non-medullated fibres. They are deficient in the white substance of Schwann, and consist of axis-cylinders, with a distinct nucleated sheath, in which there are, however, fewer nuclei than in ordinaTy non-medullated fibres. Surgical Anatomy.—In severe injuries to the head, the olfactory bulb may become separated from the olfactorv nerves, thus producing loss of the sense of smelling {anosmia), and with this a considerable loss in the sense of taste, as much of the perfection of the sense of taste is due to the sapid substances being also odorous, and simultaneously excitmg the sense of smell. Second Nebve (fig. 438) Fig. 438. -The left optic nerve and optic tracts. The Second or Optic Nerve, the special nerve of the sense of sight, is distributed exclusively to the eyeball. The nerves of opposite sides are connected together at the commissure, and from the back of the commissure they may be traced to the brain, under the name of the optic tracts. The optic tract, at its connection with the brain, is divided into two bands. One of these arises from the stratum opticum of the corpora quadrigemina, and emerges from the nates of this body as the anterior brachium, and passes obliquely outwards between the inner and outer geniculate bodies ; the second arises from the optic thalamus, and passes through the inner geniculate body, from which it derives fibres, and joins with the other band to form the optic tract. From this origin the tract winds obliquely across the under surface of the crus cerebri, in the form of a flattened band, destitute of neurilemma, and is attached to the crus by its anterior margin. It then assumes a cylindrical form, and, as it passes forwards, is connected with the tuber cinereum and lamina cinerea, from both of which it receives fibres. It finally joins with the tract of the opposite side to form the optic commissure. The commissure or chiasma, somewhat quadri- lateral in form, rest upon the optic groove of the sphenoid bone, being bounded, above, by the lamina cinerea; behind, by the tuber cinereum ; on either side, by the anterior perforated space. Within the commissure, the optic nerves of the two sides under- go a partial decussation. The fibres which form the inner margin of each tract are continued across from one to the other side of the brain, and have no connection with the optic nerves. These may be regarded as commissural fibres [intercerehral) between the thalami of opposite sides. Some fibres are continued across the anterior border of the chiasma, and connect the optic nerves of the two sides, having no relation with the optic Fia. 439.—Course of the fibres in the optic commissure.737 THIRD NERVE. MOTOR OCULI tracts.* They may be regarded as commissural fibres between the two retinae {inter-retinal fibres). The outer fibres of each tract are contmued into the optic nerve of the same side. The central fibres of each tract are continued into the optic nerve of the opposite side, decussating in the commissure with similar fibres of the opposite tract, f The optic nerves arise from the fore part of the commissure, and, diverging from one another, become rounded in form and firm in texture, and are enclosed in a sheath derived from the arachnoid. As each nerve passes through the correspond- ing optic foramen, it receives a sheath from the dura mater ; and as it enters the orbit this sheath subdivides into two layers, one of which becomes continuous with the periosteum of the orbit; the other forms the proper sheath of the nerve, and surrounds it as far as the sclerotic. The nerve passes through the cavity of the orbit, pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats at the back part of the eyeball, a little to the nasal side of its centre, and expands into the retina. Arnold describes a communi- cation between the optic nerve in the orbit and the ascending branches of Meckel's ganglion. A small artery, the arteria centralis retincB, perforates the optic nerve a little behind the globe, and runs along its interior in a tubular canal of fibrous tissue. It supplies the inner surface of the retina, and is accompanied by corresponding veins. Surgical Anatomy.—The optic nerve is peculiarly liable to become the seat of neuritis or undergo atrophy in affections of the central nervous system, and as a rule the patho- logical relationship between the two affections is exceedingly difficult to trace. There are, however, certain points in connection with the anatomy of this nerve which tend to throw light upon the frequent association of these afi'ections with intracranial disease : (i) From its mode of development (see page 91), and from its structure, the optic nerve must be regarded as a prolongation of the brain-substance, rather than as' an ordinary cerebro-spinal nerve. (2) As it passes from the brain, it receives sheaths from the three cerebral membranes, a perineural sheath from the pia mater ; an intermediate sheath from the arachnoid, and an outer sheath from the dura mater, which is also connected with the periosteum, as it passes through the optic foramen. These sheaths are separated from each other hj spaces, which communicate with the subdural and subarachnoid spaces respectively. The innermost or perineural sheath sends a process around the arteria centralis retinee into the interior of the nerve, and enters intimately into the structure of the nerve. Thus inflammatory affections of the meninges or of the brain may readily extend themselves along these spaces, or along the interstitial connective tissue in the nerve. The course of the fibres in the optic commissure has an important pathological bearing, and has been the subject of much controversy. Microscopic examination, experiments, and pathology all seem to point to the fact that there is a partial decussation of the fibres, each tract supplying the corresponding half of each eye, so that the right tract supplies the right half of each eye, and the left tract the left half of each eye. At the same time Charcot believes, and his view has met with general acceptation, that the fibres which do not decussate at the optic commissure have already decussated in the corpora quadrigemina, so that lesion of the cerebral centre of one side causes complete blindness of the opposite eye, because both sets of decussating fibres are destroyed. Whereas should one tract, say the right, be destroyed by disease, there will be blindness of the right half of both retinae. An antero-posterior section through the commissure would divide the decussating fibres, and would therefore produce blindness of the inner half of each eye ; while a section at the margin of the side of the optic commissure would produce blindness of the external half of the retina of the same side. The optic nerve may also be affected in injuries or diseases involving the orbit; in fractures of the anterior fossa of the base of the skull; in tumours of the orbit itself, or those invading this cavity fi^om neighbouring parts. Third Nerve (figs. 440, 441, 442) The Third or Motor Oculi Nerve supplies all the muscles of the orbit, except the Superior oblique and External rectus ; it also sends motor filaments to the iris and the ciliary muscle. It is a rather large nerve, of rounded form and firm texture. * The presence of these fibres has been doubted by some observers, but they have been recently asserted to exist by Stilling. t A specimen of congenital absence of the optic commissure is to be found in the Museum of the Westminster Hospital. See also Henle, Ne7^venlehre, p. 393, ed. 2. 3BCRANIAL NERVES 738 Its apparent origin is from the inner surface of the crus cerebri, immediately in front of the pons Varohi. The deep oricjm may be traced through the Fig. 440.—Nerves of the orbit. Seen from above. Infratrochleai' nerve locus niger and tegmentum of the crus to a nucleus situated on either side of the median line beneath the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius. On emerging from the brain, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It then pierces the dura mater in front of and external to the posterior clinoid process, pas- sing between the two processes from the free and attached borders of the tentorium, which are prolonged forwards to be connected with the an- terior and posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. It passes along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves, re- ceiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. It then divides into two branches, which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the External rectus muscle. On passing through the fissure, the nerve is placed below the fourth and the frontal and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic nerve, and has passing between its two divisions the nasal nerve. Motor root Sensory root Becurrent filament to dura mater Fig. 441.—Plan of the motor oculi nerve. (After Flower.) LEVATOR PALPEBR/E,739 FOURTH NERVE. TROCHLEAR The sujperior division, the smaller, passes inwards over the optic nerve, and supplies the Superior rectus and Levator palpebrse. It occasionally communi- cates with the ganglionic branch of the nasal nerve. The inferior division, the larger, divides into three branches. One passes beneath the optic nerve to the Internal rectus; another, to the Inferior rectus ; and the third, the largest of the three, passes forwards between the Inferior and External recti to the Inferior oblique. From this latter a short, thick branch is given off to the lower part of the lenticular ganglion, which forms its inferior root. It also gives off one or two filaments to the Inferior rectus. All these branches enter the muscles on their ocular surface. Surgical Anatomy.—Paralysis of the third nerve may be the result of many causes: as cerebral disease ; conditions causing pressure on the cavernous sinus; periostitis of the bones entering into the formation of the sphenoidal fissure. It results, when complete, in (i) ptosis, or drooping of the upper eyelid, in consequence of the Levator palpebrae being paralysed ; (2) external strabismus, on account of the unopposed action of the External rectus muscle, which is not supplied by the third nerve, and is not therefore paralysed; (3) dilatation of the pupil, because the sphincter fibres of the iris are paralysed; (4) loss of power of accommodation, as the sphincter pupillae, the ciliary muscle, and the Internal rectus are paralysed; (5) slight prominence of the eyeball, from the compressing action of the Superior oblique, which is not paralysed. Occasionally paralysis may affect only a part of the nerve, that is to say, there may be, for example, a dilated and fixed pupil, with ptosis, but no other signs. Irritation of the nerve causes spasm of one or other of the muscles supplied by it; thus, there maybe internal strabismus from spasm of the Internal rectus; accommodation for near objects only from spasm of the ciliary muscle, or myosis, contraction of the pupil, from irritation of the sphincter of the pupil. Fourth Nerve (fig. 440) The Fourth or Trochlear Nerve (pathetic), the smallest of the cranial nerves, supplies the Superior oblique muscle. Its apparent origin, at the base of the brain, is on the outer side of the crus cerebri, just in front of the pons Varolii, but the fibres can be traced backwards behind the corpora quadrigemina to the valve of Vieussens, on the upper surface of which the two nerves decussate. Its deep origin may be traced to a nucleus in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius immediately below that of the third nerve, with which it is continuous. The nerve winds round the outer side of the crus cerebri, immediately above the pons Varolii, pierces the dura mater in the free border of the tentorium cerebelli, just behind, and external to, the posterior clinoid process, and passes forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, between the third nerve and the ophthalmic division of the fifth. It crosses the third nerve and enters the orbit, through the sphenoidal fissure. It now becomes the highest of all the nerves, lying at the inner extremity of the fissure internal to the frontal nerve. In the orbit it passes inwards, above the origin of the Levator palpebr^, and finally enters the orbital surface of the Superior oblique muscle. In the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, this nerve is not unfrequently blended with the ophthalmic division of the fifth. Branches of communication.—In the outer wall of the cavernous sinus it receives some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. In the sphenoidal fissure it occasionally gives off a branch to assist in the formation of the lachrymal nerve. Branches of distri- bution.—It gives off a recurrent branch, which passes backwards between the layers of the tentorium, dividing into two or three filaments which may be traced as far back as the wall of the lateral sinus. Surgical Anatomy.—The fourth nerve when paralysed causes loss of function in the Superior oblique, so that the patient is unable to turn his e^^e downwards and outwards. Should the patient attempt to do this, the eye on the affected side is twisted inwards, producing diplopia or double vision. Accordingly, it is said that the first symptom of this disease which presents itself is giddiness when going down hill or in descending stairs, owing to the double vision induced by the patient looking at his steps whilst descending. 3 B 2CRANIAL NERVES Fifth Neeve The Fifth or Trifacial Nerve {trigeminus) is the largest cranial nerve. It resembles a spinal nerve : (i) in arising by two roots ; (2) in having a ganglion developed on its posterior root ; and (3) in its function, since it is a compound nerve. It is the great sensory nerve of the head and face, and the motor nerve of the muscles of mastication. Its upper two divisions are entirely sensory, the third division is partly sensory and partly motor. It arises by two roots : of these the anterior is the smaller, and is the motor root; the posterior, the larger and sensory. Its suijerficial origin is from the side of the pons VaroHi, nearer to the upper than the lower border. The smaller root consists of three or four bundles ; the larger root consists of numerous bundles of fibres, varying in number from seventy to a hundred. The two roots are separated from one another by a few of the transverse fibres of the pons. The deep origin of the larger or sensory root is from a nucleus on a level with the middle of the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, just internal to the margin of the fourth ventricle. The deeiJ origin of the smaller or motor root is from a nucleus internal to the sensory root, and just external to the fasciculus teres on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The two roots of the nerve pass forwards through an oval opening in the dura mater, on the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, above the internal auditory meatus : they then run between the bone and the dura mater to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where the fibres of the sensory root form a large, semilunar ganglion (Gasserian), while the motor root passes beneath the ganglion without having any connection with it, and joins outside the cranium with one of the trunks derived from it. The Gasserian or semilunar g'anglion* is lodged in a depression near the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It is of somewhat crescentic form, with its convexity turned forwards. Its upper surface is intimately adherent to the dura mater. Besides the small or motor root, the large superficial petrosal nerve lies underueath the ganglion. Branches of communication.—This ganglion receives, on its inner side, fila- ments from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. Branches of distribution.—It -gives off minute branches to the tentorium cerebelli and the dura mater, in the middle fossa of the cranium. From its anterior border, which is directed forwards and outwards, three large branches proceed : the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. The ophthalmic and superior maxillary consist exclusively of fibres derived from the larger root and ganglion, and are solely nerves of common sensation. The third division, or inferior maxillary, is joined outside the cranium by the motor root. This, therefore, strictly speaking, is the only portion of the fifth nerve which can be said to resemble a spinal nerve. Ophthalmic Neeve (figs. 440, 442, 443) The Ophthalmic, or first division of the fifth, is a sensory nerve. It supplies the eyeball, the lachrymal gland, the mucous lining of the eye and nasal fossfe, and the integument of the eyebrow, forehead, and nose. It is the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth, arising from the upper part of the Gasserian ganglion. It is a short, flattened band, about an inch in length, which passes forwards along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, below the other nerves, and just before entering the orbit, through the sphenoidal fissure, divides into three branches, lachrymal, frontal, and nasal. Branches of communication.—The ophthalmic nerve is joined by filaments * A Viennese anatomist, Eainmnd Baltliasar Hirsch (1765), was the first who recognised the ganglionic nature of the swelling on the sensory root of the fifth nerve, and called it, m honour of his otherwise unknown teacher, Jon. Laur. Gasser, the ' Ganglion Gasseri.' Julius Casserins, whose name is given to the musculo-cutaneous nerve of the arm, was Professor at Padua, 1545-1605. See Hyrtl, Lehrbnch der Anatomie, p. 895 and p. 55.741 FIFTH NERVE. OPHTHALMIC DIVISION from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, communicates with the third and sixth nerves, and is not unfrequently joined with the fourth. Branches of distribution.—It gives off recurrent filaments which pass between the layers of the tentorium along with a branch from the fourth nerve, and then divides into Lachrymal. Frontal. Nasal. The Lachrymal is the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic. Not unfrequently it arises by two filaments, one from the ophthalmic, the other from the fourth. It passes forwards in a separate tube of dura mater, and enters the orbit through the narrowest part of the sphenoidal fissure. In the orbit it runs along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, with the lachrymal artery, and sends oft' a recurrent branch which joins the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and occasionally takes the place of the temporal branch of this nerve, which is then absent. AVithin the lachrymal gland it gives off several Fig. 442.—Nerves of the orbit and ophthalmic ganglion. Side view. filaments, which supply the gland and the conjunctiva. Finally, it pierces the tarsal ligaments, and terminates in the integument of the upper eyehd, joining with filaments of the facial nerve. The Frontal is the largest division of the ophthalmic, and may be regarded, both from its size and direction, as the continuation of the nerve. It enters the orbit above the muscles, through the highest and broadest part of the sphenoidal fissure, and runs forwards along the middle line, between the Levator palpebrae and the periosteum. Midway between the apex and base of the orbit it divides into two branches, supratrochlear and supra-orbital. The supratrochlear branch, the smaller of the two, passes inwards, above the pulley of the Superior obhque muscle, and gives off a descending filament, which joins with the infratrochlear branch of the nasal nerve. It then escapes from the orbit between the pulley of the Superior obhque and the supra-orbital foramen, curves up on to the forehead close to the bone, and ascends beneath the Corrugator supercilii and Occipito-frontahs muscles, and supphes the integument of the lower part of the forehead on either side of the middle line. The supra-orbital branch passes forwards through the supra-orbital foramen, and gives off, in this situation, palpebral filaments to the upper eyelid. It then742 CRANIAL NERVES ascends upon the forehead, and termmates in cutaneous and pericranial branches. The cutaneous branches, two in number, an inner and an outer, supply the integument of the cranium as far back as the occiput. They are at first situated beneath the Occipito-frontalis, the inner branch perforating the frontal portion of the muscle, the outer branch its tendinous aponeurosis. The pericranial branches are distributed to the pericranium over the frontal and parietal bones. The Nasal nerve is intermediate in size between the frontal and lachrymal, and more deeply placed than the other branches of the ophthalmic. It enters the orbit between the two heads of the External rectus, and passes obliquely inwards across the optic nerve, beneath the Levator palpebr^e and Superior rectus muscles, to the inner wall of the orbit, where it enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen, immediately below the Superior oblique. It then enters the cavity of the cranium, traverses a shallow groove on the front of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and passes down, through the slit by the side of the crista galli, into the nose, where it divides into two branches, an internal and an external. The internal branch supplies the mucous membrane near the fore part of the septum of the nose. The external branch descends in a groove on the inner surface of the nasal bone, and supplies a few filaments to the mucous membrane covering the fore part of the outer wall of the nares as far as the inferior spongy bone ; it then leaves the cavity of the nose, between the lower border of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage of the nose, and, passing down beneath the Compressor nasi, supplies the integument of the ala and the tip of the nose, joining with the facial nerve. The branches of the nasal nerve are, the ganglionic, ciliary, and infratrochlear. The ganglionic is a slender branch, about half an inch in length, which usually arises from the nasal, between the two heads of the External rectus. It passes forwards on the outer side of the optic nerve, and enters the superior and posterior angle of the ciliary ganglion, forming its superior or long root. It is sometimes joined by a filament from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, or from the superior division of the third nerve. The long ciliary nerves, two or three in number, are given off from the nasal as it crosses the optic nerve. They join the short ciliary nerves from the ciliary gang-lion, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and, running forwards between it and the choroid, are distributed to the ciliary muscle, iris, and cornea. The infratrochlear branch is given off just before the nasal nerve passes through the anterior ethmoidal foramen. It runs forwards along the upper border of the Internal rectus, and is joined, beneath the pulley of the Superior oblique, by a filament from the supratrochlear nerve. It then passes to the inner angle of the eye, and supplies the integument of the eyelids and side of the nose, the conjunctiva, lachrymal sac, and caruncula lachrymalis. Ophthalmic Ganglion (fig. 442, 443) Connected with the three divisions of the fifth nerve are four small ganglia. With the first division is connected the ophthalmic ganglion; with the second division, the spheno-palatine or MecheVs ganglion; and with the third, the otic and submaxillary ganglia. All the four receive sensory filaments from the fifth, and motor and sympathetic filaments from various sources; these filaments are called the roots of the ganglia. The Ophthalmic, Lenticular, or Ciliary Ganglion is a small, quadrangular, flattened ganglion, of a reddish-grey colour, and about the size of a pin's head, situated at the back part of the orbit between the optic nerve and the External rectus muscle, lying generally on the outer side of the ophthalmic artery. It is enclosed in a quantity of loose fat, which makes its dissection somewhat difficult. Its branches of communication, or roots, are three, all of which enter its posterior border. One, the long or sensory root, is derived from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and joins its superior angle. The second, the short or motor root, is a short, thick nerve, occasionally divided into two parts, which is derivedCEANIAL NERVES 744 from the branch of the third nerve to the Inferior oblique muscle, and is connected with the inferior angle of the ganglion. The third, the sympathetic root, is a slender filament from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. This is frequently blended with the long root, though it sometimes passes to the ganglion separately. According to Tiedemann, this ganglion receives a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion. Its branches of distrihutioji are the short ciliary nerves. These are delicate filaments, from six to ten in number, which arise from the fore part of the ganglion in two bundles, connected with its su^Derior and inferior angles ; the lower bundle "is the larger. They run forwards with the ciliary arteries in a wavy course, one set above and the other below the optic nerve, and are joined by the long ciliary nerves from the nasal. They pierce the sclerotic at the back part of the globe, pass forwards in delicate grooves on its inner surface, and are distributed to the ciliary muscle, iris, and cornea. Tiedemann has described one small branch as penetrating the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retinae. SuPEKioR Maxillary Neeve (fig. 444) The Superior Maxillary, or second division of the fifth, is a sensory nerve. It IS intermediate, both in position and size, between the ophthalmic and inferior maxillary. It commences at the middle of the Gasserian ganglion as a flattened plexiform band, and passes forwards through the foramen rotundum, where it becomes more cylindrical in form, and firmer in texture. It then crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the orbit through the spheno-maxillary fissure, traverses the infra-orbital canal in the floor of the orbit, and appears upon the face at the infra-orbital foramen.* At its termination, the nerve lies beneath the Levator labii superioris muscle, and divides into a leash of branches, which spread out upon the side of the nose, the lower eyelid, and upper lip, joining with filaments of the facial nerve. Branches of distrihiition.—The branches of this nerve maybe divided into four groups: I. Those given off in the cranium. 2. Those given off in the spheno- maxillary fossa. 3.

The mening^eal branch is given off directly after its origin from the Gasserian ganglion, and supplies the dura mater, communicating with a meningeal branch from the inferior maxillary nerve. The orbital or temporo-malar branch arises in the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and divides at the back of that cavity into two branches, temporal and malar. The temijoral branch runs in a groove along the outer wall of the orbit (in the malar bone), receives a branch of communication from the lachrymal, and, passing through a foramen in the malar bone, enters the temporal fossa. It ascends between the bone and substance of the Temporal muscle, pierces this muscle and the temporal fascia about an inch above the zygoma, and is distributed to the integument covering the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. As After it enters the infra-orbital canal, the nerve is frequently called the infra- orbital.745 FIFTH. SUPEEIOE MAXILLARY DIVISION it pierces the temporal fascia, it gives off a slender twig, which runs between the two layers of the fascia to the outer angle of the orbit. The malar branch passes along the external inferior angle of the orbit, emerges upon the face through a foramen in the malar bone, and, perforating the Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, supplies the skin on the prominence of the cheek, and is named suhcutaneus malcB. It joins with the facial and the palpebral branches of the superior maxillary. The spheno-palatine branches, two in number, descend to the spheno-palatine ganglion. The posterior superior dental branches arise from the trunk of the nerve just as it is about to enter the infra-orbital canal ; they are generally two in number. Fig. 444.—Distribution of the second and third divisions of the fifth nerve and submaxillary ganglion. but sometimes arise by a single trunk and immediately divide and pass downwards on the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone. They give off several twigs to the gums and neighbouring parts of the mucous membrane of the cheek {superior gingival branches). They then enter the posterior dental canals on the zygomatic surface of the superior maxillary bone, and, passing from behind forwards in the substance of the bone, communicate with the middle dental nerve, and give off branches to the lining membrane of the antrum and three twigs to each of the molar teeth. These twigs enter the foramina at the apices of the fangs, and supply the pulp. The middle superior dental branch is given off from the superior maxillary nerve in the back part of the infra-orbital canal, and runs downwards and forwards in a special canal in the outer wall of the antrum to supply the two746 CEANIAL NEKVES bicuspid teeth. It communicates with the posterior and anterior dental branches. At its point of communication with the posterior branch is a slight thickening which has received the name of the ganglion of Valentin; and at its point of communication with the anterior branch is a second enlargement, which is called the ganglion of Bochclalek. Neither of these is probably a true ganglion. The anterior superior dental branch, of large size, is given off from the superior maxillary nerve just before its exit from the infra-orbital foramen ; it enters a special canal in the anterior wall of the antrum, and, coursing from before back- wards, divides into a series of branches which supply the incisor and canine teeth. It communicates with the middle dental branch and gives off a nasal branch, which passes through a minute canal into the nasal fossa, and supplies the mucous membrane of the fore part of the inferior meatus and the floor of this cavity, communicating with the naso-palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion. Fig. 445.—The spheno-palatine ganglion and its branches. The palpebral branches pass upwards beneath the Orbicularis palpebrarum. They supply the integument and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid with sensation, joining at the outer angle of the orbit with the facial nerve and malar branch of the orbital. The nasal branches pass inwards ; they supply the integument of the side of the nose, and join with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The labial branches, the largest and most numerous, descend beneath the Levator labii superioris, and are distributed to the integument of the upper lip, the mucous membrane of the mouth, and labial glands. All these branches are joined, immediately beneath the orbit, by filaments from the facial nerve, forming an intricate plexus, the infra-orbital. Spheno-palatine Ganglion (fig. 445) The spheno-palatine ganglion {MecheVs), the largest of the cranial ganglia, is deeply placed in the spheno-maxillary fossa, close to the spheno-palatine foramen. It is triangular or heart-shaped, of a reddish-grey colour, and is situated just below the superior maxillary nerve as it crosses the fossa.747 FIFTH. SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION Its branches of communication.—Like the other gangiia of the fifth nerve, it possesses a motor, a sensory, and a sympathetic root. Its sensory root is derived from the superior maxillary nerve through its two spheno-palatine branches. These branches of the nerve, given off in the spheno-maxillary fossa, descend to the ganglion. Their fibres, for the most part, pass in front of the ganglion, as they proceed to their destination, in the palate and nasal fossa, and are not incorporated in the ganglionic mass ; some few of the fibres, however, enter the ganglion, constituting its sensory root. Its motor root is derived from the facial nerve through the large superficial petrosal nerve ; and its sympathetic root, from the carotid plexus, through the large deep petrosal nerve. These two nerves join together to form a single nerve, the Vidian, before their entrance into the ganglion. The large superficial petrosal branch (nervus petrosus superficialis major) is given off from the intumescentia ganglioformis in the aqueductus Fallopii; it passes through the hiatus Fallopii; enters the cranial cavity, and runs for- wards contained in a groove on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, lying beneath the dura mater and the Gasserian ganglion. It then enters the cartilaginous substance which fills in the foramen lacerum medium basis cranii, and joining with the large deep petrosal branch forms the Vidian nerve. The large deep petrosal branch [nervus petrosus profundus) is given off from the carotid plexus, and runs through the carotid canal on the outer side of the internal carotid artery. It then enters the cartilaginous substance which fills in the foramen lacerum medium, and joins with the large superficial petrosal nerve to form the Vidian. The Vidian nerve, formed in the cartilaginous substance which fills in the middle lacerated foramen by the junction of the two preceding nerves, passes forwards, through the Vidian canal, with the artery of the same name, and, entering the spheno-maxillary fossa, joins the posterior angle of Meckel's ganglion. Its branches of distribution are divisible into four groups: ascending, which pass to the orbit; descending, to the palate ; internal, to the nose ; and posterior branches, to the pharynx and nasal fossae. The ascending branches are two or three delicate filaments, which enter the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and supply the periosteum. Arnold describes and delineates these branches as ascending to the optic nerve. Bock describes a branch as going to the cavernous sinus to communicate with the sixth nerve, and Tiedemann a communicating branch to the ophthalmic ganglion. The descending or palatine branches are distributed to the roof of the mouth, the soft palate, tonsil, and lining membrane of the nose. They are almost a direct continuation of the spheno-palatine branches of the superior maxillary nerve, and are three in number : anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior or large palatine nerve descends through the posterior palatine canal, emerges upon the hard palate, at the posterior palatine foramen, and passes forwards through a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth. It supplies the gums, the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate, and communicates in front with the termination of the naso-palatine nerve. While in the posterior palatine canal, it gives oft' inferior nasal branches, which enter the nose through openings in the palate bone, and ramify over the middle meatus and the middle and inferior spongy bones; and, at its exit from the canal, a palatine branch is distributed to both surfaces of the soft palate. The middle or external palatine nerve descends, through one of the accessory palatine canals, distributing branches to the uvula, tonsil, and soft palate. It is occasionally wanting. posterior or small palatine nerve descends with a small artery through the small posterior palatine canal, emerging by a separate opening behind the posterior palatine foramen. It supplies the Levator palati and Azygos uvulae muscles, the soft palate, tonsil, and uvula. The middle and posterior palatine join with theCRANIAL NERVES 748 tonsillar branches of the giosso-pharyngeal to form the plexus around the tonsil (circidus toJisiUaiis). The internal hranclies are distributed to the septum and outer wall of the nasal fossaB. They are the superior nasal (anterior) and the naso-palatine. The suijerior nasal hranclies {anterior), four or five in number, enter the back part of the nasal fossa by the spheno-palatine foramen. They supply the mucous membrane covering the superior and middle spongy bones, and that lining the posterior ethmoidal cells, a few being prolonged to the upper and back part of the septum. One branch is continued on to the inner surface of the anterior wall of the antrum, and there forms a communication with the anterior dental nerve. At the point of communication a sv/elling exists, denominated 'the ganglion of Bochdalek,' the nature of which seems to be, however, uncertain. The naso-ioalatine nerve {Cotunnius) also enters the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and passes inwards across the roof of the nose, below the orifice of the sphenoidal sinus, to rea.ch the septum ; it then runs obliquely downwards and forwards along the lower part of the septum, to the anterior palatine foramen, lying between the periosteum and mucous membrane. It descends to the roof of the mouth through the anterior palatine canal. The two nerves are here contained in separate and distinct canals, situated in the intermaxillary suture, and termed the foramina of Scarpa, the left nerve being usually anterior to the right one. In the mouth, they become united, supply the mucous membrane behind the incisor teeth, and join with the anterior palatine nerve. The naso-palatine nerve occasionally furnishes a few small filaments to the mucous membrane of the septum. The jjosterior branches are, the pharyngeal (pterygo-palatine), and the upper posterior nasal branches. The pharyngeal nerve (pterygo-palatine) is a small branch arising from the back part of the ganglion, being generally blended with the Vidian nerve. It passes through the pterygo-palatine canal with the pterygo-palatine artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx, behind the Eustachian tube. The upper posterior nasal branches are a few twigs given off from the posterior part of the ganglion, which run backwards in the sheath of the Vidian nerve to the mucous membrane at the back part of the roof, septum, and superior meatus of the nose and that covering the end of the Eustachian tube. Inferior Maxillary Nerve (fig. 444) The Inferior Maxillary Nerve distributes branches to the teeth and gums of the lower jaw, the integument of the temple and external ear, the lower part of the face and lower lip, and the muscles of mastication : it also supplies the tongue with a large branch. It is the largest of the three divisions of the fifth, and is made up of two roots : a large or sensory root ^Droceeding from the inferior angle of the Gasserian ganglion ; and a small or motor root, which passes beneath the ganglion, and unites with the sensory root, just after its exit through the foramen ovale. Immediately beneath the base of the skull, this nerve divides into two trunks, anterior and posterior. Previous to its division, the primary trunk gives off from its inner side a recurrent (meningeal) branch, and the nerve to the Internal pterygoid muscle. The recurrent branch is given off directly after its exit from the foramen ovale. It passes backwards into the skull through the foramen spinosum with the middle meningeal artery. It divides into two branches, anterior and posterior, which accompany the main divisions of the artery and supply the dura mater. The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The Internal Pterygoid Nerve, given off from the inferior maxillary, previous to its division, is intimately connected at its origin with the otic ganglion. It is aFIFTH. INFEEIOR MAXILLARY DIVISION 749 long and slender branch, which passes inwards to enter the deep surface of the Internal pterygoid muscle. The anterior and smaller division, which receives nearly the whole of the motor root, divides into branches, which supply the muscles of mastication. They are, the masseteric, deep temporal, buccal, and external pterygoid. The masseteric branch passes outwards, above the External pterygoid muscle, in front of the temporo-maxillary articulation, and crosses the sigmoid notch with the masseteric artery, to the Masseter muscle, in which it ramifies nearly as far as its anterior border. It occasionally gives a branch to the Temporal muscle, and a filament to the articulation of the jaw. The deep temporal branches, tw^o in number, anterior and posterior, supply the deep surface of the Temporal muscle. The posterior branch, of small size, is placed at the back of the temporal fossa. It is sometimes joined with the masse- teric branch. The anterior branch [s reflected upwards, at the pterygoid ridge of the sphenoid, to the front of the temporal fossa. Sometimes there are three deep temporal branches, the third branch (middle deep temporal) passing outwards over the External pterygoid muscle to enter the deep surface of the Temporal muscle. The buccal branch passes forwards between the two heads of the External pterygoid, and downwards beneath the inner surface of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, or through the fibres of the Temporal muscle, to reach the surface of the Buccinator, upon which it divides into a superior and an inferior branch. It gives a branch to the External pterygoid during its passage through that muscle, and a few ascending filaments to the Temporal muscle, one of which occasionally joins with the anterior branch of the deep temporal nerve. The upper branch supplies the integument and upper part of the Buccinator muscle, joining with the facial nerve round the facial vein. The loioer branch passes forwards to the angle of the mouth ; it supplies the integument and Buccinator muscle, as well as the mucous membrane lining the inner surface of that muscle, and joins the facial nerve.* The External Pterygoid Nerve is most frequently derived from the buccal, but it may be given off separately from the anterior trunk of the nerve. It enters the muscle on its inner surface. The posterior and larger division of the inferior maxillary nerve is for the most part sensory, but receives a few filaments from the motor root. It divides into three branches : auriculo-temporal, lingual (gustatory), and inferior dental. The Auriculo-temporal Nerve generally arises by two roots, beneath which the middle meningeal artery passes. It runs backwards beneath the External ptery- goid muscle to the inner side of the neck of the lower jaw. It then turns upwards with the temporal artery, between the external ear and condyle of" the jaw, under cover of the parotid gland, and, escaping from beneath this structure, ascends over the zygoma, and divides into two temporal branches. The branches of communication are with the facial and with the otic ganglion. The branches of communication with the facial, usually two in number, pass forwards, from behind the neck of the condyle of the jaw, to join this nerve at the posterior border of the Masseter muscle. They form one of the principal branches of communication between the facial and the fifth nerve. The filaments of communication with the otic ganglion are derived from the commencement of the auriculo-temporal nerve. The branches of distribution are :— * There seems to be no reason to doubt that the branch supplying the Buccinator muscle is entirely a nerve of ordinary sensation, and that the true motor supply of this muscle is from the facial. Auricular, inferior and superior. Branches to the meatus auditorius. Temporal, anterior and posterior. Articular. Parotid.CEANIAL NEEVES 75° The inferior auricular arises behind the articulation of the jaw, and is distri- buted to the ear below the external meatus: other filaments twine round the internal maxillary artery, and communicate with the sympathetic. The superior auricular arises in front of the external ear, and supplies the integument covering the tragus and pinna. Branches to the meatus auclitorius, two in number, arise from the point of communication between the auriculo-temporal and facial nerves, and are distri- buted to the meatus. A branch to the temporo-maxillary articulation is usually derived from the auriculo-temporal nerve. The parotid branches supply the parotid gland. The anterior temporal accompanies the temporal artery to the vertex of the skull, and supplies the integument of the temporal region, communicating with the facial nerve, and the temporal branch of.the temporo-malar, from the superior maxillary. The posterior temporal, the smaller of the two, is distributed to the upper part of the pinna and the neighbouring tissues. The Lingual Nerve (gustatory) supplies the papillae and mucous membrane of the tongue. It is deeply placed throughout the whole of its course. It lies at first beneath the External pterygoid muscle, together with the inferior dental nerve, being placed to the inner side of the latter nerve, and is occasionally joined to it by a branch which crosses the internal maxillary artery. The chorda tympani also joins it at an acute angle in this situation. The nerve then passes between the Internal pterygoid muscle and the inner side of the ramus of the jaw, and crosses obliquely to the side of the tongue over the Stylo-glossus muscle, and then between the Hyo-glossus muscle and deep part of the submaxillary gland; the nerve lastly runs across Wharton's duct, and along the side of the tongue to its apex, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane. The branches of communication are with the facial through the chorda tympani, the inferior dental and hypoglossal nerves, and the submaxillary ganglion. The branches to the submaxillary ganglion are two or three in number ; those connected with the hypoglossal nerve form a plexus at the anterior margin of the Hyo-glossus muscle. The branches of (listribution are few in number. They supply the mucous membrane of the mouth, the gums, the sublingual gland, the filiform and fungi- form papillffi and mucous membrane of the tongue; the terminal filaments communicate, at the tip of the tongue, with the hypoglossal nerve. The Inferior Dental is the largest of the three branches of the inferior maxillary nerve. It passes downwards with the inferior dental artery, at first beneath the External pterygoid muscle, and then between the internal lateral ligament and the ramus of the jaw to the dental foramen. It then passes forwards in the dental canal of the inferior maxillary bone, lying beneath the teeth, as far as the mental foramen, where it divides into two terminal branches, incisor and mental. The branches of the inferior dental are, the mylo-hyoid, dental, incisive and mental. The mylo-hyoid is derived from the inferior dental just as that nerve is about to enter the dental foramen. It descends in a groove on the inner surface of the ramus of the jaw, in which it is retained by a process of fibrous membrane. It reaches the under surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, and supplies it and the anterior belly of the Digastric, occasionally sending one or two filaments to the submaxillary gland. The dental branches supply the molar and bicuspid teeth. They correspond in number to the fangs of those teeth : each nerve entering the orifice at the point of the fang, and supplying the pulp of the tooth. The incisive branch is continued onwards within the bone to the middle line, and supplies the canine and incisor teeth. The mental branch emerges from the bone at the mental foramen, and divides beneath the Depressor anguli oris into two or three branches ; one descends to751 FIFTH. OTIC GANGLION supply the skin of the chin, and another (sometimes two) ascends to supply the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip. These branches communicate freely with the facial nerve. Two small ganglia are connected with the inferior maxillary nerve : the otic with the trunk of the nerve ; and the submaxillary with its lingual branch. Otic Ganglion (fig. 446) The Otic Ganglion {ArnolcVs) is a small, oval-shaped, flattened ganglion of a reddish-grey colour, situated immediately below the foramen ovale, on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, and round the origin of the internal ptery- goid nerve. It is in relation, externally, with the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve, at the point where the motor root joins the sensory portion; internally, with the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube, and the origin of the Tensor palati muscle ; hehmd it is the middle meningeal artery. Branches of communication.—This ganglion is connected with the internal pterygoid branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, by two or three short, delicate filaments. From this it may obtain a motor root, and possibly also a sensory root, as these filaments from the nerve to the Internal pterygoid may contain sensory Fig. 446.—The otic ganglion and its branches. fibres. It communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and facial nerves, through the small superficial petrosal nerve continued from the tympanic plexus (page 762), and through this communication it probably receives its sensory root from the glosso-pharyngeal and its motor root from the facial; its communication with the sympathetic is effected by a filament from the plexus surrounding the middle meningeal artery. The ganglion also communicates with the auriculo-temporal nerve. This is probably a branch from the glosso-pharyngeal which passes to the ganglion, and through it and the auriculo-temporal nerve to the parotid gland. Its branches of distribution are, a filament to the Tensor tympani, and one to the Tensor palati. The former passes backwards, on the outer side of the Eustachian tube ; the latter arises from the ganglion, near the origin of the internal pterygoid nerve, and passes forwards. The fibres of these nerves are, however, mainly derived from the nerve to the Internal pterygoid muscle. It also gives off a small communicating branch to the chorda tympani.CRANIAL NERVES 752 SUBMAXILLAEY GaNGLION (fig. 444) The submaxillary ganglion is of small size, fusiform in shape, and situated above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, near the posterior border of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, being connected by filaments with the lower border of the lingual (gustatory) nerve. Brandies of communication.—This ganglion is connected with the lingual (gustatory) nerve by a few filaments which join it separately, at its fore and back part. It also receives a branch from the chorda tympani, by which it communicates with the facial; and communicates with the sympathetic by filaments from the sympathetic plexus around the facial artery. Branches of distribution.—These are five or six in number ; they arise from the lower part of the ganglion, and supply the mucous membrane of the mouth and Wharton's duct, some being lost in the submaxillary gland. The branch of communication from the lingual to the fore part of the ganglion is by some regarded as a branch of distribution, by which filaments of the chorda tympani pass from the ganglion to the nerve, and by it are conveyed to the sublingual gland and the tongue. Surface Marking.—It will be seen from the above description that the three terminal branches of the three divisions of the fifth nerve emerge from foramina in the bones of the skull and face on to the face : the terminal branch of the first division emerging through the supra-orbital foramen ; that of the second tlirough the infra-orbital foramen; and the third through the mental foramen. The supra-orbital foramen is situated at the junction of tlie internal and middle third of the supra-orbital arch between the internal and external angular processes. If a straight line is drawn from this point to the lower border of the inferior maxillary bone, so that it passes between the two bicuspid teeth in both jaws, it will pass over the infra-orbital and mental foramina; the former being situated about one centimetre (| of an inch) below the margin of the orbit, and the latter varying in position according to the age of the individual. In the adult it is midway between the upper and lower borders of the inferior maxillary bone ; in the child it is nearer the lower border, and in the edentulous jaw of old age it is close to the upper margin. Surgical Anatomy.—The fifth nerve may be affected in its entirety; or its sensory or motor root may be affected ; or one of its primary main divisions. In injury to the sensory root there is anaesthesia of the whole of the side of the face on the side of the lesion, with the exception of the skin over the parotid gland ; insensibility of the conjunctiva, followed by destructive inflammation of the cornea, partly from loss of trophic influence, and partly from the irritation produced by the presence of foreign bodies on it, which are not perceived by the patient, and therefore not expelled by the act of winking; dryness of the nose, loss to a considerable extent of the sense of taste, and diminished secretion of the lachrymal and salivaiy glands. In injury to the motor root, there is impaired action of the lower jaw, from paralysis of the muscles of mastication on the affected side. The fifth nerve is often the seat of neuralgia, and each of the three divisions has been divided, or a portion of the nerve excised, for this affection. The supra-orbital nerve may be exposed by making an incision an inch and a half in length along the supra- orbital margin below the eyebrow, which is to be drawn upwards, the centre of the incision corresponding to the supra-orbital notch. The skin and Orbicularis palpebrarum having been divided, the nerve can be easily found emerging from the notch, and lying in some loose cellular tissue. It should be drawn up by a blunt hook and divided, or, what is better, a portion of it removed. The infra-orbital nerve has been divided at its exit by an incision on the cheek; or the floor of the orbit has been exposed, the infra-orbital canal opened up, and the anterior part of the nerve resected; or the whole nerve, together with Meckel's ganglion as far back as the foramen rotundum, has been removed. This latter operation, though undoubtedly a severe proceeding, appears to have been followed by the best results. The operation is performed as follows : the superior maxillary bone is first exposed by a T-shaped incision, one limb passing along the lower margin of the orbit, the other from the centre of this vertically down the cheek to the angle of the mouth. The nerve is then found, divided, and a piece of silk tied to it as a guide. A small trephine (|-inch) is then applied to the bone, below, but including the infra-orbital foramen, and the antrum opened. The trephine is now applied to the posterior wall of the antrum, and the spheno-maxillary fossa exposed. The infra-orbital canal is now opened up from below by fine cutting-pliers or a chisel, and the nerve drawn down into the trephine hole, it being held on the stretch by means of the piece of silk; it is severed with fine curved scissors as near the foramen rotundum as possible, any branches coming off from the ganglion being also divided.* The inferior dental nerve has been divided at its exit from the foramen by an * Camochan, Amer. Journ. Med. Science, 1858, p. 136.753 SIXTH. ABDUCENT incision made through the mucous membrane where it is reflected from the alveolar process on to the lower lip ; or a portion of the nerve has been resected by an incision on the cheek through the Masseter muscle, exposing the outer sm-face of the ramus of the jaw. A trephine was then applied over the position of the inferior dental foramen and the outer table removed, so as to expose the inferior dental canal. The nerve was dissected out of the portion of the canal exposed, and, having been divided after its exit from the mental foramen, it was by traction on the end exposed in the trephine hole, drawn out entire, and cut off as high up as possible.* The inferior dental nerve has also been divided by an incision within the mouth, the bony point guarding the inferior dental foramen forming the guide to the nerve. The buccal nerve may be divided by an incision through the mucous membrane of the mouth and the Buccinator just in front of the anterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw (Stimson). The lingual (gustatory) nerve is occasionally divided with the view of relieving the pain in cancerous disease of the tongue. This may be done in that part of its course where it lies below and behind the last molar tooth. If a line is drawn from the middle of the crown of the last molar tooth to the angle of the jaw it will cross the nerve, which lies about half an inch behind the tooth, parallel to the bulging alveolar ridge on the inner side of the body of the bone. If the knife is entered three-quarters of an inch behind and below the last molar tooth, and carried down to the bone, the nerve will be divided. Plilton divided it opposite the second molar tooth, where it is covered only by the mucous membrane, and Lucas pulls the tongue forwards and over to the opposite side, when the nerve can be seen standing out as a firm cord under the mucous membrane by the side of the tongue, and can be easily seized with a sharp hook and divided, or a portion excised. This is a simple enough operation on the cadaver, but when the disease is extensive and has extended to the floor of the mouth, as is generally the case when division of the nerve is required, the operation is not practicable. Sixth Nerve (fig. 442) The Sixth or Abducent Nerve supplies the External rectus muscle. Its superficial origin is by several filaments from the constricted part of the pyramid, close to the pons, or from the lower border of the pons itself, in the groove between this body and the medulla. Its deep origin is a little lower than the motor root of the fifth, and close to the median line, beneath the anterior portion of the fasciculus teres on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The nerve pierces the dura mater on the basilar surface of the sphenoid bone, runs through a notch immediately below the posterior clinoid process, and enters the cavernous sinus. It passes forwards through the sinus, lying on the outer side of the internal carotid artery. It enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and lies above the ophthalmic vein, from which it is separated by a lamina of dura mater. It then passes between the two heads of the External rectus, and is distributed to that muscle on its ocular surface. Branches of communicatioji.—It is joined by several filaments from the carotid and cavernous plexus, by one from Meckel's ganglion (Bock), and another from the ophthalmic nerve. The above-mentioned nerve, as well as the third, fourth, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth, as they pass to the orbit, bear a certain relation to each other in the cavernous sinus, at the sphenoidal fissure, and in the cavity of the orbit, which will now be described. In the cavernous sinus (fig. 384), the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth are placed on the outer wall of the sinus, in their numerical order, both from above downwards, and from within outwards. The sixth nerve lies at the outer side of the internal carotid artery. As these nerves pass forwards to the sphenoidal fissure, the third and fifth nerves become divided into branches, and the sixth approaches the rest ; so that their relative position becomes considerably changed. In the sphenoidal fissure (fig. 447), the fourth, and the frontal and lachrymal divisions of the ophthalmic lie upon the same plane, the former being most internal, the latter external; and they enter the cavity of the orbit above the muscles. The remaining nerves enter the orbit between the two heads of the External rectus. The superior division of the third is the highest of these; * Mears, Trans. Amer. Surg. Assoc. vol. ii. p. 469. 3C754 CRANIAL NERVES beneath this lies the nasal branch of the ophthalmic; then the inferior division of the third; and the sixth lowest of all. In the orhit, the fourth, and the frontal and lachrymal divisions of the ophthalmic, lie on the same plane immediately beneath the periosteum, the fourth nerve being internal and resting on the Superior oblique, the frontal resting on the Levator palpebrae, and the lachrymal on the External rectus. Next in order comes the superior division of the third nerve lying immediately beneath the Superior Fig. 447.—Relations of structures passing through the sphenoidal fissure. LACHRYMAL rectus, and then the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, crossing the optic nerve from the outer to the inner side of the orbit. Beneath these is found the optic nerve, surrounded in front by the ciliary nerves, and having the lenticular ganglion on its outer side, between it and the External rectus. Below the optic is the inferior division of the third, and the sixth, which lies on the outer side of the orbit. Surgical Anatomy.—The sixth nerve is more frequently involved in fractures of the base of the skull than any other of the cranial nerves. The result of paralysis of this nerve is internal or convergent squint. When injured so that its function is destroyed, there is, in addition to the paralysis of the External rectus muscle, often a certain amount of contraction of the pupil, because some of the sympathetic fibres to the radiating muscle of the iris pass along with this nerve. Seventh Neeve (figs. 448, 449, 450) The Seventh or Facial Nerve (portio dura) is the motor nerve of all the muscles of expression in the face, and of the Platysma and Buccinator ; the muscles of the External ear; the posterior belly of the Di- gastric, and the Stylo-hyoid. Through its chorda tympani it supplies the Lingualis; by its tympanic branch, the Stapedius. Its superficial origin is from the lateral tract of the medulla oblon- gata, in the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies. Its deep origin is from a nucleus on the floor of the fourth ventricle, a little below and external to the nucleus of the sixth, above the level of the auditory striae. The auditory nerve {portio mollis) lies to its outer side, and between the two is a small fasciculus {portio inter duram etmollemoi Wrisberg, or pars intermedia), which arises from the medulla and joins the facial nerve in the internal auditory meatus. At its origin it is frequently connected with both the nerves, between which it lies. Fig. 448.—The course and connections of the facial nerve in the temporal bone. External petrosal Small superficial petrosal Large superficial petrosal—-^^ Intumescentia ganglioformisSEVENTH. FACIAL 755 The facial nerve, firmer, rounder, and smaller than the auditory, passes forwards and outwards upon the middle peduncle of the cerebellum, and enters the internal auditory meatus with the auditory nerve. Within the meatus, the facial nerve lies first to the inner side of the auditory, and then in a groove upon that nerve. The pars intermedia is placed between the facial and auditory nerves in the internal auditory meatus ; a few of its fibres frequently pass into the auditory nerve, while the remainder join the facial. At the bottom of the meatus it is connected to this nerve by one or two slender filaments. At the bottom of the meatus, the facial nerve enters the aqueductus Fallopii, and follows the serpentine course of that canal through the petrous portion of the temporal bone, from its commencement at the internal meatus, to its termination at the stylo-mastoid foramen. It is at first directed outwards towards the inner wall of the tympanum, where it forms a reddish gangiiform swelling {intumescentia ganglioformis, or geniculate ganglion), and is joined by several nerves ; then bending suddenly backwards, it runs in the internal wall of the tympanum, above the fenestra ovalis, and at the back of that cavity passes vertically downwards behind the tympanum to the stylo-mastoid foramen. On emerging from this aperture, it runs forwards in the substance of the parotid gland, crosses the external carotid artery, and divides behind the ramus of the lower jaw into two primary branches, tempoTo-facial and cervico-facial, from which numerous offsets are distributed over the side of the head, face, and upper part of the neck, supplying the superficial muscles in these regions. As the primary branches and their offsets diverge from each other, they present somewhat the appearance of a bird's claw ; hence the name of j;es anserinus is given to the divisions of the facial nerve in and near the parotid gland. The communications of the facial nerve may be thus arranged :— In the internal auditory meatus . With the auditory nerve. ^With Meckel's ganglion by the large superficial petrosal nerve.

Opposite the hiatus Fallopii, the gangiiform enlargement on the facial nerve communicates with Meckel's ganglion by means of the large superficial petrosal nerve, which forms its motor root; with the otic ganglion, by the small superficial petrosal nerve ; and with the sympathetic filaments accompanying the middle meningeal artery, by the external petrosal (Bidder). From the gangiiform enlarge- ment, according to Arnold, a twig is sent back to the auditory nerve. At its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it sends a twig to the glosso- pharyngeal, another to the pneumogastric nerve, and communicates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, with the great auricular branch of the cervical plexus, with the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve in the parotid gland, and on the face with the terminal branches of the three divisions of the fifth.

The tympanic branch arises from the nerve opposite the pyramid ; it passes through a small canal vn the pyramid, and supplies the Stapedius muscle. The chorda tympani is given off from the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of the tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It passes from below upwards and forwards in a distinct canal, and enters the cavity of the tympanum, through an aperture (iter chordcB loosterkis) on its posterior wall between the opening of the mastoid cells and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner end of the Glaserian fissure, which is called the iter cJiordce anterius, or canal of Huguier. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, meets the lingual nerve at an acute angle, and accompanies it to the submaxillary gland; part of it then joins the submaxillary ganglion; the rest is continued onwards into the properSEVENTH. FACIAL muscular fibres of the tongue-the Inferior lingualis muscle. A few of its fibres probably pass through the submaxillary ganghon to the subhngual gland. Before jommg the hngual nerve it receives a small communicating branch from the otic ganglion. The Posterior auricular nerve arises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards m front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the mastoid branch of the auricularis magnus and with the small occipital. As it ascends between the meatus and mastoid process it divides into two branches Fig. 450.—The nerves of the scalp, face, and side of th e neck. TerminaUor of su^pratrochlear of infratrochlear nasal The aunmdar branch supphes the Eetrahens aurem and the small muscles on the cranial surface of the pinna. The occipital branch, the larger, passes backwards along the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and supplies the occipital portion of the Occipito-frontahs. ^ The digastric branch usually arises by a common trunk with the Stylo-hvoid branch ; it divides into several filaments, which supply the posterior belly of the Ihgastric; one of these perforates that muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal The stylo-hyoid is a long slender branch, which passes inwards, entering theCRANIAL NERVES 758 Stylo-hyoicl muscle about its middle; it communicates with the sympathetic filaments on the external carotid artery. The Temporo-facial, the larger of the two terminal branches, passes upwards and forwards through the parotid gland, crosses the external carotid artery and temporo-maxillary vein, and passes over the neck of the condyle of the jaw, being connected in this situation with the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, and divides into branches, which are distributed over the temple and upper part of the face ; these are divided into three sets : temporal, malar, and infra-orbital. The temporal branches cross the zygoma to the temporal region, supplying the Attrahens and Attollens aurem muscles, and join with the temporal branch of the temporo-maxillary, a branch of the superior maxillary, and with the auriculo- temporal branch of the inferior maxillary. The more anterior branches supply the frontal portion of the Occipito-frontalis, the Orbicularis palpebrarum, and Corrugator supercilii muscles, joining with the supra-orbital and lachrymal branches of the ophthalmic. The malar branches pass across the malar bone to the outer angle of the orbit, where they supply the Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle, joining with filaments from the lachrymal nerve ; others supply the lower eyelid, joining with filaments of the malar branch [subcutaneus malce) of the superior maxillary nerve. The infra-orbital, of larger size than the rest, pass horizontally forwards to be distributed between the lower margin of the orbit and the mouth. The superficial branches run beneath the skin and above the superficial muscles of the face which they supply : some branches are distributed to the Pyramidalis nasi, joining at the inner angle of the orbit with the infra trochlear and nasal branches of the ophthalmic. The deep branches pass beneath the Zygomatici and the Levator labii superioris, supplying them and the Levator anguli oris, and form a plexus (infra- orbital) by joining with the infra-orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve and the buccal branches of the cervico-facial. This branch also supplies the Levator labii superioris algeque nasi and the small muscles of the nose. The Cervico-facial division of the facial nerve passes obliquely downwards and forwards through the parotid gland, crossing the external carotid artery. In this situation it is joined by branches from the great auricular nerve. Opposite the angle of the lower jaw it divides into branches which are distributed on the lower half of the face and upper part of the neck. These may be divided into three sets : buccal, supramaxillary, and inframaxillary. The buccal branches cross the Masseter muscle. They supply the Buccinator and Orbicularis oris, and join with the infra-orbital branches of the temporo-facial division of the nerve, and with filaments of the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The supramaxillary branches pass forwards beneath the Platysma and Depressor anguli oris, supplying the muscles of the lower lip and chin, and communicating with the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve. The inframaxillary branches run forward beneath the Platysma, and form a series of arches across the side of the neck over the suprahyoid region. One of these branches descends vertically to join with the superficialis colli nerve from the cervical plexus ; others supply the Platysma. Surgical Anatomy.—The facial nerve is more frequently'- paralysed than any of the other of the cranial nerves. The paralysis may depend either upon (i) central causes, i.e. blood clots or intracranial tumours pressing on the nerve before its entrance into the internal auditory meatus. It is also one of the nerves involved in ' bulbar paralysis.' Or (2) it may be paralysed in its passage through the petrous bone, by damage due to middle ear disease, or by fractures of the base. Or (3) it may be affected at or after its exit from the stj'lo-mastoid foramen. This is commonly known as ' Bell's paralysis.' It may be due to exposure to cold or to injury of the nerve, either from accidental wounds of the face, or during some surgical operation, as removal of parotid tumours, opening of abscesses, or operations on the lower jaw. When the cause is central, the sixth nerve is usually also paralysed, and there is hemiplegia on the opposite side. In these cases the electrical reactions are the same759 NINTH. GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL as in health ; whereas, when the paralysis is m|the course of the nerve, the reaction is usually lost. When the nerve is paralysed in*tne*petrous bone, in addition to the paralysis of the muscles of expression, there is loss of taste in the anterior part of the tongue, and the patient is unable to recognise the difference between bitters and sweets, acids and salines, from involvement of the chorda tympani. The mouth is dry, because the salivary glands are not secreting; and the sense of hearing is affected from paralysis of the Stapedius. When the cause of the paralysis is from fracture of the base of the skull, the auditory nerve and the petrosal nerves, which are connected with the intumescentia ganglioformis, are also involved. When the injury is after the exit of the nerve from the stylo-mastoid foramen, all the muscles of expression, except the Levator palpebrte, together with the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid, are paralysed. There is smoothness of the forehead, and the patient is unable to frown : the eyelids cannot be closed and the lower lid droops, so that the punctum is no longer in contact with the globe, and the tears run down the cheek ; there is smoothness of the cheek and loss of the naso-labial furrow; the nostril cannot be dilated ; the mouth is drawn to the sound side, and there is inability to whistle ; food collects between the cheek and gum from paralysis of the Buccinator. The facial nerve is at fault in cases of so-called 'histrionic spasm,' which consists in an almost constant and uncontrollable twitching of the muscles of the face. This twitching is sometimes so severe as to cause great discomfort and annoyance to the patient, and to interfere with sleep, and for its relief the facial nerve has been stretched. The operation is performed by making an incision behind the ear, from the root of the mastoid process to the angle of the jaw. The parotid is turned forwards and the dissection carried along the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle and mastoid process, until the upper border of the posterior belly of the Digastric is found. The nerve is parallel to this on about a level of the middle of the mastoid process. When found, the nerve must be stretched by passing a blunt hook beneath it and pulling it forwards and outwards. Too great force must not be used, for fear of permanent injury to the nerve. Eighth Neeve The Eighth or Auditory Nerve (portio mollis) is the special nerve of the sense of hearing, being distributed exclusively to the internal ear. Its sujjerficial origin is from the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies at the lower border of the pons. It lies external to the facial nerve. It has two deej) origins : i. From a prominence, the auditory tubercle, on the outer side of the inferior fovea on the floor of the fourth ventricle. 2. From a nucleus situated at the lateral angle of the same ventricle. The auditory nerve winds round the restiform body, and passes forwards across the posterior border of the middle peduncle of the cerebellum, in company with the facial nerve, from which it is partially separated by a small artery (auditory). It then enters the internal auditory meatus with the facial nerve. At the bottom of the meatus, it receives one or two filaments from the facial nerve, and then divides into two branches, cochlear and vestibular, which are distributed, the former to the cochlea, the latter to the vestibule and semicircular canals. The auditory nerve is soft in texture (hence the name portio mollis), and is destitute of neurilemma. The distribution of the auditory nerve in the internal ear will be found described along with the anatomy of that organ in a subsequent page. Surgical Anatomy.—The auditory nerve is frequently injured, together with the facial nerve, in fractm^es of the middle fossa of the base of the skull implicating the internal auditory meatus. The nerve ma^^ be either torn across, producing permanent deafness, or it may be bruised or pressed upon by extravasated blood or inflammatory exudation, when the deafness will in all probability be temporary. The nerve may also be injured by violent blows on the head without fracture, and deafness may arise from loud explosions from dynamite, etc., probably from some lesion of this nerve, which is more liable to be inju]?ed than the other cranial nerves on account of its structm-e. The test that the nerve is destroyed, and that the deafness is not due to some lesion of the auditory apparatus, is obtained by placing a vibrating tuning-fork on the head. The vibrations will be heard in cases where the auditory apparatus is at fault, but not in cases of destruction of the auditory nerve. Ninth Pair (figs. 451, 452, 453) The Ninth or Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (figs. 451, 452, 453) is distributed, as its name implies, to the tongue and pharynx, being the nerve of sensation to the mucous membrane of the pharynx, fauces, and tonsil; and a special nerve of tasteCRANIAL NERVES 760 to all the parts of the tongue to whioii it is distribnted. Its sui:)erficial origin is by three or four filaments closely connected together, from the u^Dper part of the medulla oblongata, in the groove between the olivary and the restiform body. Its deep origin may be traced through the fasciculi of the lateral tract, to a nucleus of grey matter at the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle beneath the inferior fovea, below the inner nucleus of the auditory nerve, and above that of the pneumogastric. From its superficial origin, it passes outwards across the flocculus, and leaves the skull at the central part of the jugular foramen, in a separate sheath of the dura mater, in front of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves (fig. 386). In its passage through the jugular foramen, it grooves the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; and, at its exit from the skull, passes forwards between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, and descends in front of the latter Fig. 451.—Nerves of the eighth vessel, and beneath the styloid process and pair, their origin, ganglia, and the muscles connected with it, to the lower communications. border of the Stylo-pharyngeus. The nerve juyuinya„„gi. now curves inwards, forming an arch on the side of the neck, and lying upon the Stylo- pharyngeus and Middle constrictor of the pharynx, above the superior laryngeal nerve. It then passes beneath the Hyo-glossus, and is finally distributed to the mucous membrane of the fauces and base of the tongue, and the mucous glands of the mouth and tonsil. In passing through the jugular foramen, the nerve presents, in succession, two gangli- form enlargements. The superior, the smaller, is called the jugular ganglion; the inferior and larger, the ijetrous ganglion, or the ganglion of Andersch. The superior, or jugular, ganglion is situated in the upper part of the groove in which the nerve is lodged during its passage through the jugular foramen. It is of very small size, and involves only the lower part of the trunk of the nerve. It is usually regarded as a segmentation from the lower ganglion. The inferior, or petrous, ganglion is situated in a depression in the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; it is larger than the former, and involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve. From this ganglion arise those filaments which connect the glosso-pharyngeal with the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. The branches of communication are with the pneumogastric, sympathetic, and facial. The branches to the pneumogastric are two filaments, arising from the petrous ganglion, one to its auricular branch, and one to the upper ganglion of the pneumogastric. The branch to the sympathetic, also arising from the petrous ganglion, is connected with the superior cervical ganglion. The branch of communication with the facial perforates the posterior belly of the Digastric. It arises from the trunk of the nerve below the petrous ganglion, and joins the facial just after its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. The branches of distribution are, the tympanic, carotid, pharyngeal, muscular, tonsillar, and lingual. The tympanic branch (Jacobson's nerve) arises from the petrous ganglion, and enters a small bony canal in the lower surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; the lower opening of which is situated on ■ the bony ridge which separates the carotid canal from the jugular fossa. It ascends to the tympanum, enters that cavity by an aperture in its floor close to the inner wall, and divides into branches, which are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory, forming the tympanic plexus.CRANIAL NERVES 762 Its branches of distribution are, one to the fenestra rotunda, one to the fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the tympanmn and Eustachian tube. Its branches of communication are three, and occupy separate grooves on the surface of the promontory. -Course and distribution of the eighth pair of nerves. Fig. 453- Glosso-phctryngeal_ Fneumogastfic Spinal accessory One branch, the small deep petrosal, arches forwards and downwards to the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. A second, the long petrosal nerve, runs forwards through a canal close to or in the processus cochleari- formis and enters the foramen lacerum medium, where it joins the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and gener- ally the large superficial petrosal nerve. The third branch runs upwards through the substance of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In its course it passes by the gangliform enlargement of the facial nerve, and, receiving a connecting filament from it, becomes the small superficial petrosal nerve. This nerve enters the skull through a small aperture, situated ex- ternal to the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior surface of the petrous bone; courses for- wards across the base of the skull, and emerges through a foramen in the middle fossa (sometimes the foramen ovale), and joins the otic ganglion. The carotid branches de- scend along the trunk of the internal carotid artery as far as its commencement, com- municating with the pharyn- geal branch of the pneumo- gastric, and with branches of the sympathetic. The pharyngeal branches are three or four filaments which unite opposite the Middle constrictor of the pharynx with the pharyngeal branches of the pneumo- gastric, the external laryn- geal, and sympathetic nerves, to form the pharyngeal plexus, branches from which perforate the muscular coat of the pharynx to supply the muscles and mucous membrane. The muscular branch is distributed to the Stylo-pharyngeus.763 TENTH. PNEUMOGASTKIC The tonsillar branches supply the tonsil, forming a plexus (circulus tonsillaris) around this body, from which branches are distributed to the soft palate and fauces, where they communicate with the palatine nerves. The lingual branches are two in number: one supplies the circumvallate papilla and the mucous membrane covering the surface of the base of the tongue; the other perforates its substance, and supplies the mucous membrane and follicular glands of the tongue and anterior surface of the epiglottis. Tenth Pair (fig. 452, 453) The Tenth or Pneumogastric Nerve {nervus vagus or jjar vagum) has a more extensive distribution than any of the other cranial nerves, passing through the neck and thorax to the upper part of the abdomen. It is composed of both motor and sensory fibres. It supplies the organs of voice and respiration with motor and sensory fibres ; and the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, and heart with motor fibres. Its superficial origin is by eight or ten filaments from the groove between the olivary and the restiform body below the glosso-pharyngeal; its deep origin may be traced through the fasciculi of the medulla, to terminate in a nucleus of grey matter at the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, below and continuous with the nucleus of origin of the giosso-pharyngeal. The filaments become united, and form a flat cord, which passes outwards beneath the flocculus to the jugular foramen, through which it emerges from the cranium. In passing- through this opening, the pneumogastric accompanies the spinal accessory, being contained in the same sheath of dura mater with it, a membranous septum separating it from the glosso-pharyngeal, which lies in front (fig. 386). The nerve in this situation presents a well-marked ganglionic enlargement, which is called jugular ganglion, or the ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric : to it the accessory part of the spinal accessory nerve is connected by one or two filaments. After the exit of the nerve from the jugular foramen, the nerve is joined by the accessory portion of the spinal accessory, and enlarges into a second gangliform swelling, called the ganglion inferius. or the ganglion of the trunk of the nerve ; through which the fibres of the spinal accessory pass unchanged, being principally distributed to the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus, but some of the filaments from it are continued into the trunk of the vagus below the ganglion to be distributed with the recurrent laryngeal nerve and probably also with the cardiac nerves. The nerve passes vertically down the neck within the sheath of the carotid vessels lying between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein as far as the thyroid cartilage, and then between the same vein and the common carotid to the root of the neck. Here the course of the nerve becomes different on the two sides of the body. On the fight side, the nerve passes across the subclavian artery between it and the right innominate vein, and descends by the side of the trachea to the back part of the root of the lung, where it spreads out in a plexiform network {posterior pulmonary), from the lower part of which two cords descend u]3on the oesophagus, on which they divide, forming, with branches from the opposite nerve, the oesophageal plexus (plexus gulce); below, these branches are collected into a single cord, which runs along the back part of the oesophagus, enters the abdomen, and is distributed to the posterior surface of the stomach, joining the left side of the solar plexus, and send- ing filaments to the splenic plexus and a considerable branch to the coeliac plexus. On the left side, the pneumogastric nerve enters the chest between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, behind the left innominate vein. It crosses the arch of the aorta, and descends behind the root of the left lung, forming the posterior pulmonary plexus, and along the anterior surface of the oesophagus, where it unites with the nerve of the right side in forming the plexus gul^e, to the stomach, distributing branches over its anterior surface, some extending over the great cul-de-sac, and others along the lesser curvature. Filaments from these branches enter the gastro-hepatic omentum, and join the hepatic plexus.CRANIAL NERVES 764 The ganglion of the root is of a greyish colour, circular in form, about two lines in diameter, and resembles the ganglion on the large root of the fifth nerve. Connecting branches.—To this ganglion the accessory portion of the spinal accessory nerve is connected by several delicate filaments ; it also has a communi- cating twig with the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal, with the facial nerve by means of its auricular branch, and with the sympathetic by means of an ascending filament from the superior cervical ganglion. The ganglion of the trunk (inferior) is a plexiform cord, cylindrical in form, of a reddish colour, and about an inch in length; it involves the whole of the fibres of the nerve, and passing through it is the accessory portion of the spinal acces- sory nerve, which blends with the pneumogastric below the ganglion, and is then principally continued into its pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches. Connecting branches.—This ganglion is connected with the hypoglossal, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the loop between the first and second cervical nerves. The branches of the pneumogastric are— In the iugular fossa . . . f^^^^ii^g^^^ 1 Auricular. , Pharyngeal. In the neck .... ! Superior laryngeal. 1 Recurrent laryngeal.

In the thorax The meningeal branch is a recurrent branch given off from the ganglion of the root in the jugular foramen. It passes backwards and is distributed to the dura mater covering the posterior fossa of the base of the skull. The auricular branch (ArnokVs) arises from the ganglion of the root, and is joined soon after its origin by a filament from the petrous ganglion of the glosso- pharyngeal ; it passes outwards behind the jugular vein, and enters a small canal on the outer wall of the jugular fossa. Traversing the substance of the temporal bone, it crosses the aqueductus Fallopii about two lines above its termination at the stylo-mastoid foramen ; here it gives off an ascending branch, which joins the facial: the continuation of the nerve reaches the surface by passing through the auricular fissure between the mastoid process and the external auditory meatus, and divides into two branches, one of which communicates with the posterior auricular nerve, while the other supplies the integument at the back part of the pinna and the posterior part of the external auditory meatus. The pharyngeal branch, the principal motor nerve of the pharynx, arises from the upper part of the inferior ganglion of the pneumogastric. It consists principally of filaments from the accessory portion of the spinal accessory; it passes across the internal carotid artery (in front or behind), to the upper border of the Middle constrictor, where it divides into numerous filaments, which join with those from the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal (its external branch), and sympathetic, to form the pharyngeal plexus, from which branches are distributed to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx and the muscles of the soft palate. From the pharyngeal plexus a minute filament is given off, which descends and joins the hypoglossal nerve as it winds round the occipital artery. The superior laryngeal is the nerve of sensation to the larynx. It is larger than the preceding, and arises from the middle of the inferior ganglion of the pneumogastric. It consists principally of filaments from the accessory portion of the spinal accessory. In its course it receives a branch from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. It descends, by the side of the pharynx, behind theTENTH. PNEUMOGASTRIC 765 internal carotid, where it divides into two branches, the external and internal laryngeal. The external laryngeal branch, the smaller, descends by the side of the larynx, beneath the Sterno-thyroid, to supply the Crico-thyroid muscle. It gives branches to the pharyngeal plexus and the Inferior constrictor, and communicates with the superior cardiac nerve, behind the common carotid. The internal laryngeal branch descends to the opening in the thyro-hyoid membrane, through which it passes with the superior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx. A small branch communicates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The branches to the mucous membrane are distributed, some in front to the epiglottis, the base of the tongue, and the epiglottidean glands ; while others pass backwards, in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold, to supply the mucous membrane surrounding the superior orifice of the larynx, as well as the membrane which lines the cavity of the larynx as low down as the vocal cord. The filament which joins with the recurrent laryngeal descends beneath the mucous membrane on the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, where the two nerves become united. The inferior or recurrent laryngeal, so called from its reflected course, is the motor nerve of the larynx. It arises on the right side, in front of the subclavian artery; winds from before backwards round that vessel, and ascends obliquely to the side of the trachea, behind the common carotid and inferior thyroid arteries. On the left side, it arises in front of the arch of the aorta, and winds from before backwards round the aorta at the point where the remains of the ductus arteriosus are connected with it, and then ascends to the side of the trachea. The nerves on both sides ascend in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and, passing under the lower border of the Inferior constrictor muscle, enter the larynx behind the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage with the cricoid, being distributed to all the muscles of the larynx, excepting the Crico-thyroid. It communicates with the superior laryngeal nerve. The recurrent laryngeal, as it winds round the subclavian artery and aorta, gives off several cardiac filaments, which unite with the cardiac branches from the pnfeumogastric and sympathetic. As it ascends in the neck it gives off oesophageal branches, more numerous on the left than on the right side, which supply the mucous membrane and muscular coat of the oesophagus ; tracheal branches to the mucous membrane and muscular fibres of the trachea; and some pharyngeal filaments to the Inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The cervical cardiac branches, two or three in number, arise from the pneumo- gastric, at the upper and lower part of the neck. The superior branches are small, and communicate with the cardiac branches of the sympathetic. They can be traced to the great or deep cardiac plexus. The inferior branches, one on each side, arise at the lower part of the neck, just above the first rib. On the right side, this branch passes in front or by the side of the arteria innominata, and communicates with one of the cardiac nerves proceeding to the great or deep cardiac plexus. On the left side, it passes in front of the arch of the aorta, and joins the superficial cardiac plexus. The thoracic cardiac branches, on the right side, arise from the trunk of the pneumogastric, as it lies by the side of the trachea, and from its recurrent laryngeal branch ; but on the left side from the recurrent nerve only ; passing inwards, they terminate in the deep cardiac plexus. The anterior pulmonary branches, two or three in number, and of small size, are distributed on the anterior aspect of the root of the lungs. They join with filaments from the sympathetic, and form the anterior pulmonary plexus. The posterior pulmonary branches, more numerous and larger than the anterior, are distributed on the posterior aspect of the root of the lung : they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth (sometimes also first and second) thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, and form the posterior pulmojiary plexus. BranchesCRANIAL NERVES 766 from both plexuses accompany the ramifications of the air-tnbes through the substance of the hmgs. The oesophageal branches are given off from the pneumogastric both above and below the pulmonarv branches. The lower are more numerous and larger than the upper. They form, together with branches from the opposite nerve, the oesophageal plexus or plexus gulce. The gastric branches are the terminal filaments of the pneumogastric nerve. The nerve on the right side is distributed to the posterior surface of the stomach, and joins the left side of the coeliac plexus and the splenic plexus. The nerve on the left side is distributed over the anterior surface of the stomach, some filaments passing across the great cul-de-sac, and others along the lesser curvature. They unite with branches of the right nerve and with the sympathetic, some fila- ments passing through the lesser omentum to the hepatic plexus. Surgical Anatom ij.—The lai-yngeal nerves are of considerable importance in consider- ing some of the morbid conditions of the larynx. AVhen the peripheral terminations of the superior laryngeal nerve are irritated by some foreign body passing over them, reflex spasm of the glottis is the result. When the trunk of this same nerve is pressed upon, by, for instance, a goitre or an aneurism of the upper part of the carotid, we have a peculiar dry, brassy cough. When the nerve is paralysed, we have anaesthesia of the mucous membrane of the larynx, so that foreign bodies can readily enter the cavity, and, in consequence of its supplying the crico-thyroid muscle, the vocal cords cannot be made tense, and the voice is deep and hoarse. Paralysis of the superior laryngeal nerves may be the result of bulbar paralysis, may be a sequel to diphtheria when both nerves are usually involved, or it may, though less commonly, be caused by the pressure of tumours or aneurisms, when the paralysis is generally unilateral. Irritation of the inferior laryngeal nerves produces spasm of the muscles of the larynx. When both these recurrent nerves are paralysed, the vocal cords are motionless, in the so-called ' cadaveric position' —that is to say, in the position in which they are found in ordinary tranquil respiration; neither closed as in phonation, nor open as in deep inspiratory efforts. When one recurrent nerve is paralysed, the cord of the same side is motionless, while the opposite one crosses the middle line to accommodate itself to the affected one; hence phonation is present, but the voice is altered and weak in timbre. The recurrent laryngeal nerves may be paralysed in bulbar paralysis or after diphtheria, when it usually affects both sides; or they may be affected by the pressure of aneurisms of the aorta, innominate or subclavian arteries ; by mediastinal tumours ; by bronchocele ; or by cancer of the upper part of the oesophagus, when the paralysis is often unilateral. Eleventh Pair (figs. 452, 453) The Eleventh or Spinal Accessory Nerve consists of two parts: one, the accessory part to the vagus, and the other the spinal portion. The accessory part is the smaller of the two. Its superficial origin is by four or five delicate filaments from the side of the medulla, below the roots of the vagus. Its deep origin may be traced to a nucleus of grey matter at the back of the medulla, extending from the level of the top of the calamus scriptorius as far down as the intermedio-lateral tract of the spinal cord. It passes outwards to the jugular foramen, Avhere it joins with the spinal portion and with the upper ganglion of the vagus by one or two filaments ; and is then continued over the surface of this ganglion to join the trunk of the vagus, after its exit from the jugular foramen. The fibres of the accessory part then pass unchanged through the inferior ganglion, or ganglion of the trunk of the vagus, to be distributed principally to the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric. Through the pharyngeal branch it probably supplies the muscles of the soft palate (see page 400). Some few filaments from it are continued into the trunk of the vagus below the ganglion, to be distributed with the recurrent laryngeal nerve and probably also with the cardiac nerves. The spinal portion is firm in texture. Its superficial origin is by several filaments from the lateral tract of the cord, as low down as the sixth cervical nerve. Its deep origin may be traced to the intermedio-lateral tract of the grey matter of the cord. This portion of the nerve ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, enters the skull through767 TWELFTH. HYPOGLOSSAL the foramen magnum, and is then directed outwards to the jugular foramen, through which it passes, lying in the same sheath as the pneumogastric, but separated from it by a fold of the arachnoid. In the jugular foramen, it receives one or two filaments from the accessory portion. At its exit from the jugular foramen, it passes backwards, either in front of or behind the internal jugular vein, and descends obliquely behind the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles to the upper part of the Sterno-mastoid. It pierces that muscle, and passes obliquely across the occipital triangle, to terminate in the deep surface of the Trapezius. This nerve gives several branches to the Sterno-mastoid during its passage through it, and joins in its substance with branches from the second cervical, which supply the muscle. In the occipital triangle it joins with the second and third cervical nerves and assists in the formation of the cervical plexus. Beneath the Trapezius it joins with the third and fourth cervical nerves to form a sort of plexus, from which fibres are distributed to the muscle. Surgical Anatomy.—In cases of spasmodic torticollis in which all previous palliative treatment has failed, and the spasms are so severe as to midermine the patient's health, division or excision of a portion of the spinal accessory nerve has been resorted to. This may be done either along the anterior or posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The former operation is performed by making an incision from the apex of the mastoid process, three inches in length, along the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The anterior border of the muscle is defined and pulled backwards, so as to stretch the nerve, which is then to be sought for, beneath the Digastric muscle, about two inches below the apex of the mastoid process. The other operation consists in making an incision along the posterior border of the muscle, so that the centre of the incision corresponds to the middle of this border of the muscle. The superficial structures having been divided and the border of the muscle defined, the nerve is to be sought for as it emerges from the muscle to cross the occipital triangle. When found, it is to be traced upwards through the muscle, and a portion of it excised above the point where it gives off its branches to the Sterno-mastoid. In this operation one of the descending branches of the superficial cervical plexus is liable to be mistaken for the nerve. Twelfth Pair (figs. 453, 454) The Twelfth or Hypoglossal Nerve is the motor nerve of the tongue. Its superficial origin is by several filaments, from ten to fifteen in number, from the groove between the pyramidal and olivary bodies, in a continuous line with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Its deep origin can be traced to a nucleus of grey matter on the floor of the fourth ventricle, on either side of the median line, extending from the level of the auditory striae to the lowest point of the ventricle of Arantius. The filaments of this nerve are collected into two bundles, which perforate the dura mater separately, opposite the anterior condyloid foramen, and unite together after their passage through it. In those cases in which the anterior condyloid foramen in the occipital bone is double, these two portions of the nerve are separated by the small piece of bone which divides the foramen. The nerve descends almost vertically to a point corresponding with the angle of the jaw. It is at first deeply seated beneath the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and intimately connected with the pneumogastric nerve ; it then passes forwards between the vein and artery, and lower down in the neck becomes super- ficial below the Digastric muscle. The nerve then loops round the occipital artery, and crosses the external carotid below the tendon of the Digastric muscle. It passes beneath the Mylo-hyoid muscle, lying between it and the Hyo-glossus, and communicates at the anterior border of the latter muscle with the lingual (gustatory) nerve; it is then continued forwards in the fibres of the Genio-hyo-glossus muscle as far as the tip of the tongue, distributing branches to its substance. The branches of communication are, with the Pneumogastric. First and second cervical nerves. Sympathetic. Lingual (gustatory). The communication with the pneumogastric takes place close to the exit of the nerve from the skull, numerous filaments passing between the hypoglossal and lower ganglion of the pneumogastric; sometimes the two nerves are united so as768 CRANIAL NERVES to form one mass. It also communicates with the pharyngeal plexus by a minute filament as it winds round the occipital artery. The communication with the sympathetic takes place opposite the atlas by branches derived from the superior cervical ganglion, and in the same situation the nerve is joined by a filament derived from the loop connecting the first two cervical nerves. The communication with the lingual (gustatory) takes place near the anterior border of the Hyo-giossus muscle by numerous filaments which ascend upon it. The branches of distribution are, the Meningeal. Thyro-hyoid. Descendens hypoglossi. Muscular. Meningeal branches.—As the hypoglossal nerve passes through the anterior condyloid foramen it gives off, according to Luschka, several filaments to the dura mater in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull. The descendens hypoglossi is a long slender branch, which quits the hypoglossal where it turns round the occipital artery. It descends obliquely across the sheath of the carotid vessels, and joins the communicating branches from the second and third cervical nerves, just below the middle of the neck, to form a loop. From the convexity of this loop branches pass forwards to supply the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno- thyroid, and both bellies of the Omo-hyoid. According to Arnold, another filament descends in front of the vessels into the chest, and joins the cardiac and phrenic nerves. The descendens hypoglossi is occasionally contained in the sheath of the carotid vessels, being sometimes placed over, and sometimes beneath the internal jugular vein. The thyro-hyoid is a small branch, arising from the hypoglossal near the posterior border of the Hyo-glossus ; it passes obliquely across the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and supplies the Thyro-hyoid muscle.TWELFTH. HYPOGLOSSAL 769 The muscular branches are distributed to the Stylo-glossus, Hyo-glossus, Genio-hyoid, and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles. At the under surface of the tongue, numerous slender branches pass upwards into the substance of the organ to supply its muscular structure. Surgical Anatomy.—The hypoglossal nerve is an important guide in the operation of ligature of the lingual artery (see page 534). It runs forwards just above the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and forms the upper boundary of the triangular space in which the artery is to be sought for. Fig. 455.—Hypoglossal nerve, cervical plexus, and their branches. THE SPINAL NEEVES The spinal nerves are so called because they take their origin from the spinal cord, and are transmitted through the intervertebral foramina on either side of the spinal column. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, which are arranged into the following groups, corresponding to the region of the spine through which they pass:— Cervical 8 pairs. Dorsal Lumbar Sacral Coccygeal pan- It will be observed that each group of nerves corresponds in number with the vertebrae in that region, except the cervical and coccygeal. 3D *SPINAL NERVES 77° Each spinal nerve arises by two roots, an anterior or motor root, and a posterior or sensory root. EOOTS OF THE SpINAL NeRVES The Anterior Roots.—The sicperficial origin is from a somewhat irregular series of depressions, which map out a longitudinal area on the antero-lateral column of the spinal cord, gradually approaching towards the anterior median fissure as they descend. The deep origin can be traced to the anterior part of the antero-lateral column ; the roots, after penetrating horizontally through the longitudinal fibres of this tract, enter the grey substance, where their fibrils diverge in several directions: some, passing imvards, are continued across the anterior commissure in front of the central canal, to become continuous with the axis-cylinder processes of the large cells of the anterior cornua of the opposite side ; others terminate in the mesial group of cells of the anterior column of the same side; other fibrils pass outivards, some to become continuous with the axis-cylinder processes of the group of cells in the lateral part of the anterior column ; and others enter the lateral column of the same side, where, turning, upwards, they pursue their course as longitudinal fibres. The remaining fibrils pass backwards to the posterior horn, where they are continuous with the axis-cylinders of the cells at the base of the posterior cornu. The Posterior Roots.—The superficial origin is from the postero-lateral fissure of the cord. The deep origin is from the grey substance of the posterior cornu, either directly through the substantia gelatinosa, or indirectly, by first passing through the white matter of the posterior column and winding round in front of the caput cornu. Those which enter the grey matter at once, for the most part turn upwards and downwards, and become continuous with the fine nerve-plexus in the central portion of the grey matter ; some few fibres pass transversely through the posterior commissure to the opposite side, and others into the anterior cornu of the same side. Those fibres which enter the grey matter in front of the caput cornu reach the posterior vesicular column (Clarke's column) and blend with it; a few fibres passing through it, to become longitudinal in the posterior column of the cord. The anterior roots are smaller than the posterior, devoid of ganglionic enlarge- ment, and their component fibrils are collected into two bundles, near the inter- vertebral foramina. The posterior roots of the nerves are larger, but the individual filaments are finer and more delicate than those of the anterior. As their component fibrils pass outwards, towards the aperture in the dura mater, they coalesce into two bundles, receive a tubular sheath from that membrane, and enter the ganglion which is developed upon each root. The posterior root of the first cervical nerve forms an exception to these characters. It is smaller than the anterior, has frequently no ganglion developed upon it, and when the ganglion exists it is often situated within the dura mater. Ganglia of the Spinal Nerves A ganglion is developed upon the posterior root of each of the spinal nerves. These ganglia are of an oval form, and of a reddish colour ; they bear a proportion in size to the nerves upon which they are formed, and are placed in the inter- vertebral foramina, external to the point where the nerves perforate the dura mater. Each ganglion is bifid internally, where it is joined by the two bundles of the posterior root, the two portions being united into a single mass externally. The ganglion upon the first and second cervical nerves forms an exception to these characters, being placed on the arches of the vertebrae over which the nerves pass. The ganglia, also, of the sacral nerves are placed within the spinal canal; and that on the coccygeal nerve, also in the canal, about the middle of its posterior root.771 CERVICAL Distribution of the Spinal Nerves Immediately beyond the ganglion the two roots coalesce, their fibres inter- mingle, and the trunk thus formed passes out of the intervertebral foramen, and divides into a posterior division for the supply of the posterior part of the body, and an anterior division for the supply of the anterior part of the body ; each containing fibres from both roots. The posterior divisions of the spinal nerves are generally smaller than the anterior; they arise from the trunk resulting from the union of the roots, in the intervertebral foramina; and, passing backwards, divide into internal and external branches, which are distributed to the muscles and integument behind the spine. The first cervical and lower sacral nerves are exceptions to these characters. The anterior divisions of the spinal nerves supply the parts of the body in front of the spine, including the limbs. They are for the most part larger than the posterior divisions ; this increase of size being proportioned to the larger extent of structures they are required to supply. Each division is connected by slender filaments with the sympathetic. In the dorsal region the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves are completely separate from each other, and are uniform in their distribution ; but in the cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions 'they form intricate plexuses previous to their distribution. Points of Emergence of the Spinal Nerves The roots of the spinal nerves from their origin in the cord run obliquely downwards to their point of exit from the intervertebral foramina : the amount of obliquity varying in different regions of the spine, and being greater in the lower than the upper part. The level of their emergence from the cord is within certain limits variable, and of course does not correspond to the point of emergence of the nerve from the intervertebral foramina. The accompanying table, from Macalister, shows as accurately as can be shown the relation of these points of origin from the spinal cord to the bodies and spinous processes of the vertebras.

CEEVICAL NEEVES The roots of the cervical nerves increase in size from the first to the fifth, and then remain the same size to the eighth. The posterior roots bear a proportion to the anterior as 3 to i, which is much greater than in any other region, the individual filaments being also much larger than those of the anterior roots. In direction^ the roots of the cervical are less oblique than those of the other spinal nerves. The first cervical nerve is directed a little upwards and outwards ; the 3 D 2772 SPINAL NERVES second is horizontal; the others are directed obliquely doAvmvards and outwards, the lowest being the most oblique, and consequently longer than the upper, the distance between their place of origin and their point of exit from the spinal canal never exceeding the depth of one vertebra. The trunk of the first cervical nerve (suboccipital) leaves the spinal canal, between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas ; the second, between the posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis ; and the eighth (the last), between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. Each nerve, at its exit from the intervertebral foramen, divides into a posterior and an anterior division. The anterior divisions of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus. The anterior divisions of the four lower cervical nerves, together with the first dorsal, form the brachial plexus. PosTEKioE Divisions of the Ceevical Nerves (fig. 456) The posterior division of the first cervical {suboccipital) nerve differs from the posterior divisions of the other cervical nerves in not dividing into an internal and external branch. It is larger than the anterior division, and escapes from the spinal canal between the occipital bone and the posterior arch of the atlas, lying behind the vertebral artery. It enters the suboccipital triangle formed by the Rectus capitis posticus major, the Obliquus superior, and Obliquus inferior, and supplies the Recti and Obliqui muscles, and the Complexus. From the branch which supplies the Inferior oblique a filament is given off which joins the second cervical nerve. This nerve also occasionally gives off a cutaneous filament, Avhich accompanies the occipital artery, and communicates with the occipitalis major and minor nerves. The posterior division of the second cervical nerve is three or four times greater than the anterior division, and the largest of all the posterior cervical divisions. It emerges from the spinal canal between the posterior arch of the atlas and lamina of the axis, below the Inferior oblique. It supplies this muscle, and receives a communicating filament from the first cervical. It then divides into an internal and an external branch. The internal branch, called, from its size and distribution, the occipitalis rizajor, ascends obliquely inwards between the Obliquus inferior and Complexus, and pierces the latter muscle and the Trapezius near their attachments to the cranium. It is now joined by a filament from the posterior division of the third cervical nerve, and, ascending on the back part of the head with the occipital artery, divides • into two branches, which supply the integument of the scalp as far forwards as the vertex, communicating with the occipitalis minor. It gives off an auricular branch to the back part of the ear, and muscular branches to the Complexus. The external branch is often joined by the external branch of the posterior division of the third, and supplies the Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, and Complexus. The posterior division of the third cervical is smaller than the preceding, but larger than the fourth ; it differs from the posterior divisions of the remaining cervical nerves in its supplying an additional filament, the third occipital nerve, to the integument of the occiput. The posterior division of the third nerve, like the others, divides into an internal and external branch. The internal branch passes between the Complexus and Semispinalis, and, piercing the Splenius and Trapezius, supplies the skin over the latter muscle ; the external branch joins with that of the posterior division of the second to supply the Splenius, Trachelo-mastoid, and Complexus. The third occipital nerve arises from the internal or cutaneous branch beneath the Trapezius; it then pierces that muscle, and supplies the skin on the lower and back part of the head. It lies to the inner side of the occipitalis major, with which it is connected. The posterior division of the suboccipital nerve and the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the second and third cervical nerves are occasionallyCEEVICAL 773 joined beneath the Complexus by communicating branches. This communication is described by Cruveilhier as the ^posterior cervical plexus. The posterior divisions of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves (fig. 463) pass backwards, and divide, behind the Posterior intertransverse muscles, into internal and external branches. The internal branches, the larger, are distributed differently in the upper and lower part of the neck. Those derived from the fourth and fifth nerves pass between the Complexus and Semispinahs muscles, and, having reached the spinous processes, perforate the aponeurosis of Fig. 456.—Posterior divisions of the upper cervical nerves. the Splenius and Trapezius, and are continued outwards to the integument over the Trapezius, whilst those derived from the three lowest cervical nerves are the smallest, and are placed beneath the Semispinahs colh, which they supply, and then pass into the Interspinales, Multifidus spin^e and Complexus, and~ send twigs through this latter muscle to supply the integument near the spinous processes (Hu^schfeld). The external branches supply the muscles at the side of the neck, VIZ. the Cervicalis ascendens, TransversaHs colli, and Trachelo-mastoid.SPINAL NEEVES 774 Antekioe Divisions of the Cervical Neeves The anterior division of the first or suboccipital nerve is of small size. It escapes from the spinal canal through a groove upon the posterior arch of the atlas. In this groove it lies beneath the vertebral artery, to the inner side of the Eectus capitis lateralis. As it crosses the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, it receives a filament from the sympathetic. It then descends, in front of this process, to communicate with an ascending branch from the second cervical nerve. Communicating filaments from this nerve join the pneumogastric, the hypo- glossal, and sympathetic, and some branches are distributed to the Eectus lateralis and the two Anterior recti. According to Valentin, the anterior division of the Fig. 457.—Plan of the cervical plexus. RECT. CAP . LAT. suboccipital also distributes filaments to the occipito-atlantal articulation, and mastoid process of the temporal bone. The anterior division of the second cervical nerve escapes from the spinal canal, between the posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis, and, passing forwards on the outer side of the vertebral artery, divides in front of the Intertransverse muscle, into an ascending branch, which joins the first cervical; and one or two descending branches which join the third. It gives off the small occipital; a branch to assist in forming the great auricular ; another to assist in forming the superficial cervical; one of the communicantes hypoglossi, and a lilament to the Sterno-mastoid, which communicates in the substance of the muscle with the spinal accessory. The anterior division of the third cervical nerve is double the size of the775 CERVICAL PLEXUS preceding. At its exit from the intervertebral foramen, it passes downwards and outwards beneath the Sterno-mastoid, and divides into two branches. The ascending branch joins the anterior division of the second cervical; the descending branch passes down in front of the Scalenus anticus, and communicates with the fourth. It gives off the greater part of the great auricular and superficial cervical nerves ; one of the communicantes hypogiossi; a branch to the supraclavicular nerves ; a filament to assist in forming the phrenic ; and muscular branches to the Levator anguli scapula and Trapezius ; this latter nerve communicates beneath the muscle with the spinal accessory. Sometimes the nerve to the Scalenus medius is derived from this source. The anterior division of the fourth cervical is of the same size as the preceding. It receives a branch from the third, sends a communicating branch to the fifth cervical, and, passing downwards and outwards, divides into numerous filaments, which cross the posterior triangle of the neck, forming the supraclavicular nerves. It gives a branch to the phrenic nerve, whilst it is contained in the intertransverse space, and sometimes a branch to the Scalenus medius muscle. It also gives a branch to the Levator anguli scapulae and to the Trapezius, which unites with the branch given off from the third nerve, and communicates beneath the muscle with the spinal accessory. The anterior divisions of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves are remarkable for their large size. They are much larger than the preceding nerves, and are all of equal size. They assist in the formation of the brachial plexus. Cervical Plexus The cervical plexus (fig. 457) is formed by the anterior divisions of the four upper cervical nerves. It is situated opposite the four upper cervical vertebrae, resting upon the Levator anguli scapulse and Scalenus medius muscles, and covered in by the Sterno-mastoid. Its branches may be divided into two groups, suijerficial and deeiJ, which may be thus arranged :— [ Occipitalis minor. /Ascending . - Auriculans magnus. I Superficialis colli. Superficial ^Descending. Supraclavicular (Suprasternal. -| Supraclavicular, i Supra-acromial. Deep Internal External I Communicating. 1 Muscular. {Communicans hypogiossi. (Phrenic. I Communicating. Muscular. Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus The Occipitalis minor (fig. 463, page 790) arises from the second cervical nerve ; it curves round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and ascends, running parallel to the posterior border of the muscle, to the back part of the side of the head. Near the cranium it perforates the deep fascia, and is continued upwards along the side of the head behind the ear, supplying the integument, and commu- nicating with the occipitalis major, the auricularis magnus, and with the posterior auricular branch of the facial. This nerve gives off an auricular branch, which supplies the integument of the upper and back part of the auricle, communicating with the mastoid branch of the auricularis magnus. This branch is occasionally derived from the great occipital nerve. The occipitalis minor varies in size ; it is occasionally double.SPINAL NERVES 776 The Auricularis Magnus is the largest of the ascending branches. It arises from the second and third cervical nerves, winds round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and, after perforating the deep fascia, ascends upon that muscle beneath the Platysma to the parotid gland, where it divides into facial, auricular, and mastoid branches. The facial bmnches pass across the parotid, and are distributed to the integument of the face over the parotid gland ; others penetrate the substance of the gland, and communicate with the facial nerve. The aiiricular branches ascend to supply the integument of the back part of the pinna, except at its upper part, communicating with the auricular branches of the facial and pneumogastric nerves. The mastoid branch communicates with the occipitalis minor and the posterior auricular branch of the facial, and is distributed to the integument behind the ear. The Superficialis Colli arises from the second and third cervical nerves, turns round the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid about its middle, and, passing obliquely forwards beneath the external jugular vein to the anterior border of that muscle, perforates the deep cervical fascia, and divides beneath the Platysma into two branches, which are distributed to the antero-lateral parts of the neck. The ascending branch gives a filament which accompanies the external jugular vein ; it then passes upwards to the submaxillary region, and divides into branches, some of which form a plexus with the cervical branches of the facial nerve beneath the Platysma ; others pierce that muscle, supply it, and are distributed to the integument of the upper half of the neck, at its fore part, as high as the chin. The descending branch (occasionally represented by two or more filaments) pierces the Platysma, and is distributed to the integument of the side and front of the neck, as low as the sternum. The Descending or supraclavicular branches arise from the third and fourth cervical nerves : emerging beneath the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, they descend in the interval between that muscle and the Trapezius, and divide into branches, which are arranged, according to their position, into three groups. The inner or suprasternal branches cross obliquely over the clavicular and sternal attachments of the Sterno-mastoid, and supply the integument as far as the median line. The middle or supraclavicular branches cross the clavicle, and supply the integument over the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles, communicating with the cutaneous branches of the upper intercostal nerves. The external or supra-acromial branches pass obliquely across the outer surface of the Trapezius and the acromion, and supply the integument of the upper and back part of the shoulder. Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. Internal Series The communicating branches consist of several filaments, which pass from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves in front of the atlas to the pneumogastric, hypoglossal, and sympathetic; and a communicating branch between the fourth and fifth cervical. Muscular branches supply the Anterior recti and Rectus lateralis muscles; they proceed from the first cervical nerve, and from the loop formed between it and the second. The Communicans Hypoglossi (fig. 455) consists usually of two filaments, one being derived from the second, and the other from the third cervical. These filaments pass downwards on the outer side of the internal jugular vein, cross in front of the vein a little below the middle of the neck, and form a loop with the descendens hypoglossi in front of the sheath of the carotid vessels (see page 768). Occasionally, the junction of these nerves takes place within the sheath. The Phrenic Nerve {internal respiratory of Bell) arises chiefly from the fourth cervical nerve with a few filaments from the third and a communicating branch777 BRACHIAL PLEXUS from the fifth. It descends to the root of the neck, running obliquely across the front of the Scalenus anticus, passes over the first part of the subclavian artery, between it and the subclavian vein, and, as it enters the chest, crosses the internal mammary artery near its origin. Within the chest, it descends nearly vertically in front of the root of the lung, and by the side of the pericardium, between it and the mediastinal portion of the pleura, to the Diaphragm, where it divides into branches, which separately pierce that muscle, and are distributed to its under surface. The two phrenic nerves differ in their length, and also in their relations at the upper part of the thorax. The right nerve is situated more deeply, and is shorter and more vertical in direction than the left; it lies on the outer side of the right vena innominata and superior vena cava. The left nerve is rather longer than the right, from the inclination of the heart to the left side, and from the Diaphragm being lower on this than on the opposite side. At the upper part of the thorax, it crosses in front of the arch of the aorta to the root of the lung. Each nerve supplies filaments to the pericardium and pleura, and near the chest is joined by a filament from the sympathetic, and, occasionally, by one from the union of the descendens hypoglossi with the spinal nerves : this filament is found, according to Swan, only on the left side. It is also usually connected by a filament with the nerve to the Subclavius muscle. Branches have been described as passing to the peritoneum. From the right nerve, one or two filaments pass to join in a small ganglion with phrenic branches of the solar plexus : and branches from this ganglion are distributed to the hepatic plexus, the suprarenal capsule, and inferior vena cava. From the left nerve, filaments pass to join the phrenic plexus of the sympathetic, but without any ganglionic enlargement. Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. External Series Communicating branches.—The deep branches of the external series of the cervical plexus communicate with the spinal accessory nerve, in the substance of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, in the occipital triangle, and beneath the Trapezius. Muscular branches are distributed to the Sterno-mastoid, Trapezius, Levator anguli scapulaB, and Scalenus medius. The branch for the Sterno-mastoid is derived from the second cervical, the Trapezius and Levator anguli scapulaB receive branches from the third and fourth. The Scalenus medius is supplied sometimes from the third, sometimes the fourth, and occasionally from both nerves. The Brachial Plexus (fig. 458) The Brachial Plexus is formed by the union of the anterior branches of the four lower cervical and the greater part of the first dorsal nerves, receiving also a fasciculus from the fourth cervical nerve. It extends from the lower part of the side of the neck to the axilla. It is very broad and presents little of a plexiform arrangement at its commencement. It is narrow opposite the clavicle, becomes broad, and forms a more dense interlacement in the axilla, and divides opposite the coracoid process into numerous branches for the supply of the upper limb. The nerves which form the plexus are all similar in size, and their mode of communication is subject to considerable variation, so that no one plan can be given as applying to every case. The following appears, however, to be the most constant arrangement. The fifth and sixth cervical unite together soon after their exit from the intervertebral foramina to form a common trunk. The eighth cervical and first dorsal also unite to form one trunk. So that the nerves forming the plexus, as they lie on the Scalenus medius, external to the outer border of the Scalenus anticus, are blended into three trunks: an outer one formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves; a middle one, consisting of the778 SPINAL NERVES seventh cervical nerve ; and an inner one formed by the junction of the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. As they pass beneath the clavicle, each of these three trunks divides into two branches, an anterior and a ijosterior. The anterior di^dsions of the outer and middle trunks then unite to form a common cord, which is situated on the outer side of the middle part of the axillary artery, and is called the outer cord of the brachial plexus. The anterior division of the inner trunk, formed by the union of the eighth cervical and first dorsal, passes down on the inner side of the axillary artery in the middle of the axilla, and forms the inner cord of the brachial plexus. The posterior divisions of the outer trunk (formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth nerves) and of the middle trunk (the seventh nerve) unite together to form the ijosterior cord of the brachial plexus, which is Fig. 458.—Plan of the brachial plexus. FROM 4Ti? situated behind the second portion of the axillary artery. From this posterior cord are given off the two lower subscapular nerves ; the upper subscapular nerve being given off from the posterior division of the outer trunk prior to its junction with the posterior division of the middle trunk. The posterior cord divides into the circumflex and musculo-spiral nerves. The musculo-spiral nerve is subse- quently joined by the posterior division of the inner trunk, formed by the union of the eighth cervical and first dorsal. The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by a branch from the fourth to the fifth nerve, and with the phrenic nerve by a branch from the fifth cervical, which joins that nerve on the Anterior scalenus muscle : the cervical and first dorsal nerves are also joined by filaments from the middle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, close to their exit from the intervertebral foramina.BEACHIAL PLEXUS 779 Relations.—In the neck, the brachial plexus lies at first between the Anterior and Middle scaleni muscles, and then above and to the outer side of the subclavian artery: it then passes behind the clavicle and Subclavius muscle, lying upon the first serration of the Serratus magnus, and the Subscapularis muscles. In the axilla it is placed on the outer side of the first portion of the axillary artery; it surrounds the artery in the second part of its course, one cord lying upon the outer side of that vessel, one on the inner side, and one behind it; and at the lower part of the axillary space gives off its terminal branches to the upper extremity. Branches.—The branches of the brachial plexus are arranged into two gT(^ps, viz. those given off above the clavicle, and those below that bone. Bkanches above the Clavicle Communicating. Posterior thoracic. Muscular. Suprascapular. The communicating branch with the phrenic is derived from the fifth cervical nerve or from the loop between the fifth and sixth; it joins the phrenic on the Anterior scalenus muscle. The muscular branches supply the Longus colli, Scaleni, Ehomboidei, and Subclavius muscles. Those for the Longus colli and Scaleni arise froixi the lower cervical nerves at their exit from the intervertebral foramina. The rTiomboid branch arises from the fifth cervical, pierces the Scalenus medius, and passes beneath the Levator anguli scapulae, which it occasionally supplies, to the Rhomboid muscles. The nerve to the Subclavius is a small filament, which arises from the fifth cervical at its point of junction with the sixth nerve; it descends in front of the subclavian artery to the Subclavius muscle, and is usually connected by a filament with the phrenic nerve. The posterior thoracic nerve {long thoracic, external respiratory of Bell) (fig. 461) supplies the Serratus magnus, and is remarkable for the length of its course. It sometimes arises by two roots, from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves immediately after their exit from the intervertebral foramina, but generally by three roots from the fifth, sixth, and seventh nerves. These unite in the substance of the Middle scalenus muscle, and, after emerging from it, the nerve passes down behind the brachial plexus and the axillary vessels, resting on the outer surface of the Serratus magnus. It extends along the side of the chest to the lower border of that muscle, supplying filaments to each of its digitations. , The suprascapular nerve (fig. 462) arises from the cord formed by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; passing obliquely outwards beneath the Trapezius, it enters the supraspinous fossa, through the notch in the upper border of the scapula ; and, passing beneath the Supraspinatus muscle, curves in front of the spine of the scapula to the infraspinous fossa. In the supraspinous fossa it gives oft' two branches to the Supraspinatus muscle, and an articular filament to the shoulder- joint ; and in the infraspinous fossa it gives off two branches to the Infraspinatus muscle, besides some filaments to the shoulder-joint and scapula. Branches below the Clavicle The branches given off below the clavicle are derived from the three cords of the brachial plexus, in the following manner :— From the outer cord arise the external of the two anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median. From the inner cord arise the internal of the two anterior thoracic nerves, the internal cutaneous, the lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg), the ulnar and inner head of the median. From the ^posterior cord arise two of the three subscapular nerves, the third arising from the posterior division of the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; the cord then divides into the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves.SPINAL NEEVES 78q These may be arranged according to the parts they supply :— To the chest ....

The fasciculi of which these nerves are composed may be traced through the plexus to the spinal nerves from which they originate. They are as follows :— External anterior thoracic from 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical. Internal anterior thoracic „ 8th cervical and ist dorsal. Subscapular „ 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical. Circumflex 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical. Musculo-cutaneous „ 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical. Internal cutaneous ,, 8th cervical and ist dorsal. Lesser internal cutaneous „ ist dorsal. Median „ 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical, and ist dorsal. Ulnar ,, 8th cervical and ist dorsal. Musculo-spiral „ 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical, and ist dorsal. The Anterior Thoracic Nerves (fig. 461), two in number, supply the Pectoral muscles. The external or superficial nerve, the larger of the two, arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus, through which its fibres may be traced to the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. It passes inwards, across the axillary artery and vein, pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, and is distributed to the under surface of the Pectoralis major. It sends down a communicating filament to join the internal nerve, which forms a loop round the inner side of the axillary artery. The internal or deep nerve arises from the inner cord, and through it from the eighth cervical and first dorsal. It passes upwards between the axillary artery and vein, and joins with the filament from the superficial nerve. It then passes to the under surface of the Pectoralis minor muscle, where it divides into a number of branches, which supply the muscle on its under surface. Some of the branches pass through the muscle ; others wind round its upper border and pierce the costo- coracoid membrane to supply the Pectoralis major. The Subscapular Nerves, three in number, supply the Subscapularis, Teres major, and Latissimus dorsi muscles. The fasciculi of which they are composed may be traced to the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves. The upper subscapular nerve, the smallest, enters the upper part of the Sub- scapularis muscle. The loiver subscapular nerve enters the axillary border of the Subscapularis, and terminates in the Teres major. The latter muscle is sometimes supplied by a separate branch. The middle or long subscapular, the largest of the three, follows the course of the subscapular artery, along the posterior wall of the axilla to the Latissimus dorsi, through which it may be traced as far as its lower border. The Circumflex Nerve (fig. 462) supplies some of the muscles, and the integu- ment of the shoulder, and'the:shoulder-joint. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, in common with the musculo-spiral nerve, and its fibres may be traced through the posterior cord to the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cer- vical nerves. It is at first placed behind the axillary artery, between it and the Subscapularis muscle, and passes downwards and outwards to the lower border of that muscle. It then winds backwards, in company with the posterior circumflexCIRCUMFLEX 781 artery, through a quadrilateral space, bounded above by the Teres minor, below by the Teres major, internally by the long head of the Triceps, and externally by the neck of the humerus, and divides into two branches. The upper branch winds round the surgical neck of the humerus, beneath the Deltoid, with the posterior circumflex vessels, as far as the anterior border of that Fig. 459.—Cutaneous nerves of right Fig. 460.—Cutaneous nerves of right upper extremity. Anterior view. upper extremity. Posterior view. muscle, supplying it, and giving off cutaneous branches, which pierce the muscle and ramify in the integument covering its lower part. The loiver branch, at its origin, distributes filaments to the Teres minor and back part of the Deltoid muscles. Upon the filament to the former muscle a gai giiform enlargement usually exists. The nerve then pierces the deep fascia,SPINAL NERVES Fig. 461.—Nerves of the left upper extremity. .External anterior thoracic Internal anterior thoracic Musculo-cutaneous Median ~ Miisculo-spiral — Posterior interosseous liadial Anterior interosseous Deep hranch mW/ ' /783 LESSER INTERNAL CUTANEOUS and supplies the integument over the lower two-thirds of the posterior surface of the Deltoid, as well as that covering the long head of the Triceps. The circumflex nerve, before its division, gives off' an articular filament, Avhich enters the shoulder-joint below the Subscapularis. The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve (fig. 461) {external cutaneous or perforans Cas- seriiY supplies some of the muscles of the arm, and the integument of the fore- arm. It arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus, opposite the lower border of the Pectoralis minor, receiving filaments from the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves. It perforates the Coraco-brachialis muscle, passes obliquely between the Biceps and Brachialis anticus, to the outer side of the arm, and, a little above the elbow, winds round the outer border of the tendon of the Biceps, and, perforating the deep fascia, becomes cutaneous. This nerve, in its course through the arm, supplies the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, and part of the Brachialis anticus muscles. It sends a small branch to the bone, which enters the nutrient foramen with the accompanying artery and a filament, from the branch supplying the Brachialis anticus, to the elbow-joint. The cutaneous portion of the nerve passes behind the median cephalic vein, and divides, opposite the elbow-joint, into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch descends along the radial border of the forearm to the wrist, and supplies the integument over the outer half of the anterior surface. At the wrist-joint it is placed in front of the radial artery, and some filaments, piercing the deep fascia, accompany that vessel to the back of the wrist, supplying the carpus. The nerve then passes downwards to the ball of the thumb, where it terminates in cutaneous filaments. It communicates with a branch from the radial nerve, and the palmar cutaneous branch of the median. The loosterior branch passes downwards, along the back part of the radial side of the forearm, to the wrist. It supplies the integument of the lower third of the forearm, communicating with the radial nerve and the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. The Internal Cutaneous Nerve (fig. 461) is one of the smallest branches of the brachial plexus. It arises from the inner cord in common with the ulnar and internal head of the median, and, at its commencement, is placed on the inner side of the brachial artery. It derives its fibres from the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. It passes down the inner side of the arm, pierces the deep fascia with the basilic vein, about the middle of the limb, and, becoming cutaneous, divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. This nerve gives off, near the axilla, a cutaneous filament, which pierces the fascia and supplies the integument covering the Biceps muscle, nearly as far as the elbow. This filament lies a little external to the common trunk, from which it arises. The anterior branch, the larger of the two, passes usually in front of, but occasionally behind, the median basilic vein. It then descends on the anterior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm, distributing filaments to the integument as far as the wrist, and communicating with a cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch passes obliquely downwards on the inner side of the basilic vein, passes in front of, or over, the internal condyle of the humerus to the back of the forearm, and descends on the posterior surface of its ulnar side as far as the wrist, distributing filaments to the integument. It communicates, above the elbow, with the lesser internal cutaneous, and above the wrist with the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve (Swan). The Lesser Internal Cutaneous Nerve (nerve of Wrisberg) (fig. 461) is distri- buted to the integument on the inner side of the arm. It is the smallest of the branches of the brachial plexus, and arising from the inner cord, with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, receives its fibres from the first dorsal nerve. It passes through the axillary space, at first lying behind, and then on the inner side * See foot-note, p. 740.SPINAL NERVES 784 of the axillary vein, and communicates with the intercosto-hnmeral nerve. It descends along the inner side of the brachial artery to the middle of the arm, where it pierces the deep fascia, and is distributed to the integument of the back part of the lower third of the arm, extending as far as the elbow, where some filaments are lost in the integument in front of the inner condyle, and others over the olecranon. It communicates with the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve. In some cases the nerve of Wrisberg and intercosto-humeral are connected by two or three filaments, which form a plexus at the back part of the axilla. In other cases, the intercosto-humeral is of large size, and takes the place of the nerve of Wrisberg, receiving merely a filament of communication from the brachial plexus, which represents the latter nerve. In other cases, this filament is wanting, the place of the nerve of Wrisberg being supplied entirely from the intercosto- humeral. The Median Nerve (fig. 461) has received its name from the course it takes along the middle of the arm and forearm to the hand, lying between the ulnar and the musculo-spiral and radial nerves. It arises by two roots, one from the outer, and one from the inner cord of the brachial plexus; these embrace the lower part of the axillary artery, uniting either in front or on the outer side of that vessel. It receives filaments from the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical and the first dorsal. As it descends through the arm, it lies at first on the outer side of the brachial artery, crosses that vessel in the middle of its course, usually in front, but occasionally behind it, and lies on its inner side to the bend of the elbow, where it is placed beneath the bicipital fascia, and is separated from the elbow-joint by the Brachialis anticus. In the forearm it passes between the two heads of the Pronator radii teres, and descends beneath the Flexor sublimis, lying on the Flexor profundus, to within two inches above the annular ligament, where it becomes more superficial, lying between the tendons of the Flexor sublimis and Flexor carpi radialis, beneath, or rather to the ulnar side of, the tendon of the Palmaris longus, covered by the integument and fascia. It then passes beneath the annular ligament into the hand. In its course through the forearm it is accompanied by a small artery. Branches.—No branches are given ofi' from the median nerve in the arm. In the forearm its branches are, muscular, anterior interosseous, and palmar cutaneous, and, according to Riidinger and Macalister, two articular twigs to the elbow-joint. The muscular branches supply all the superficial muscles on the front of the forearm, except the Flexor carpi ulnaris. These branches are derived from the nerve near the elbow. The branch furnished to the Pronator radii teres often arises above the joint. The anterior interosseous supplies the deep muscles on the front of the forearm, except the inner half of the Flexor profundus digitorum. It accompanies the anterior interosseous artery along the interosseous membrane, in the interval between the Flexor longus pollicis and Flexor profundus digitorum muscles, both of which it supplies, and terminates below in the Pronator quadratus. The palmar cutaneous branch arises from the median nerve at the lower part of the forearm. It pierces the fascia above the annular ligament, and, descending over that ligament, divides into two branches : of which the otder supplies the skin over the ball of the thumb, and communicates with the anterior cutaneous branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve ; and the iniier supplies the integument of the palm of the hand, communicating with the cutaneous branch of the ulnar. In the palm of the hand, the median nerve is covered by the integument and palmar fascia, and crossed by the superficial palmar arch. It rests upon the tendons of the flexor muscles. In this situation it becomes enlarged, somewhat flattened, of a reddish colour, and divides into two branches. Of these, the external supplies a muscular branch to some of the muscles of the thumb, and digital branches to the thumb and index finger; the internal supplies digitalULNAR 785 branches to the contiguous sides of the index and middle, and of the middle and ring fingers. The branch to the muscles of the thumb is a short nerve, which subdivides to supply the Abductor, Opponens, and outer head of the Flexor brevis pollicis muscles; the remaining muscles of this group being supplied by the ulnar nerve. The digital branches are five in number. The first and seco7id pass along the borders of the thumb, the external branch communicating with branches of the radial nerve. The third passes along the radial side of the index finger, and supplies the First lumbricalis muscle. The foierth subdivides to supply the adjacent sides of the index and middle fingers, and sends a branch to the Second lumbrical muscle. The fifth supplies the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers, and communicates with a branch from the ulnar nerve. Each digital nerve, opposite the base of the first phalanx, gives off a dorsal branch, which joins the dorsal digital nerve from the radial, and runs along the side of the dorsum of the finger, to end in the integument over the last phalanx, x^-t the end of the finger, the digital nerve divides into a palmar and a dorsal branch : the former of which supplies the extremity of the finger, and the latter ramifies round and beneath the nail. The digital nerves, as they run along the fingers, are placed superficial to the digital arteries. The Ulnar Nerve (fig. 461) is placed along the inner or ulnar side of the upper limb, and is distributed to the muscles and integument of the forearm and hand. It is smaller than the median, behind which it is placed, diverging from it in its course down the arm. It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, in common with the inner head of the median and the internal cutaneous nerve, and derives its fibres from the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. At its commence- ment it lies at the inner side of the axillary artery, and holds the same relation with the brachial artery to the middle of the arm. From this point it runs obliquely across the internal head of the Triceps, pierces the internal intermuscular septum, and descends to the groove betw^een the internal condyle and the olecranon, accom- panied by the inferior profunda artery. At the elbow, it rests upon the back of the inner condyle, and passes into the forearm between the two heads of the Flexor carpi ulnaris. In the forearm, it descends in a perfectly straight course along its ulnar side, lying upon the Flexor profundus digitorum, its upper half being covered by the Flexor carpi ulnaris, its lower half lying on the outer side of the muscle, covered by the integument and fascia. The ulnar artery, in the upper third of its course, is separated from the ulnar nerve by a considerable interval; but in the rest of its extent the nerve lies to its inner side. At the wrist the ulnar nerve crosses the annular ligament on the outer side of the pisiform bone, to the inner side, and a little behind the ulnar artery, and immediately beyond this bone divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. The branches of the ulnar nerve are :— The articular branches distributed to the elbow-joint consist of several small filaments. They arise from the nerve as it lies in the groove between the inner condyle and olecranon. The muscular branches are two in number : one supplying the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; the other, the inner half of the Flexor profundus digitorum. They arise from the trunk of the nerve near the elbow. The cutaneous branch arises from the ulnar nerve about the middle of the fore- arm, and divides into two branches. One branch (frequently absent) pierces the deep fascia near the wrist, and is x\rticular (elbow). (Muscular. I Superficial palmar. (Deep palmar. In the forearm J Cutaneous.

The second branch [ijahnar cutaneous) lies on the ulnar artery, which it accompanies to the hand, some filaments entwining round the vessel; it ends in the integument of the palm, communicating with branches of the median nerve. The dorsal cutaneous branch arises about two inches above the wrist; it passes backwards beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, perforates the deep fascia, and, running along the ulnar side of the back of the wrist and hand, supplies the inner side of the little finger, and the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers ; it communicates with the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve, and sends a communicating filament to that branch of the radial nerve which supplies the adjoining sides of the middle and ring fingers. The articular filaments to the wrist are also supphed by the ulnar nerve. The superficial palmar branch supplies the Palmaris brevis, and the integu- ment on the inner side of the hand, and terminates in two digital branches, which are distributed, one to the ulnar side of the little finger, the other to the adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers, the latter communicating with a branch from the median. The digital branches are distributed to the fingers in the same manner as the digital branches of the median. The deep palmar branch passes between the Abductor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti muscles, and follows the course of the deep palmar arch beneath the flexor tendons. At its origin it supplies the muscles of the little finger. As it crosses the deep part of the hand, it sends two branches to each interosseous space, one for the Dorsal and one for the Palmar interosseous muscle, the branches to the Second and Third palmar interossei supplying filaments to the two inner Lumbrical muscles. At its termination between the thumb and index finger, it supplies the Adductores transversus et obliquus pollicis and the inner head of the Flexor brevis pollicis. It will be remembered that the inner part of the Flexor profundus digitorum is supplied by the ulnar nerve; the two inner Lumbricales, which are connected with the tendons of this part of the muscle, are therefore supplied by the same nerve. The outer part of the Flexor profundus is supplied by the median nerve ; the two outer Lumbricales, which are connected with the tendons of this part of the muscle, are therefore supplied by the same nerve. The Musculo-spiral Nerve (fig. 462), the largest branch of the brachial plexus, supplies the muscles of the back part of the arm and forearm, and the integument of the same parts, as well as that of the back of the hand. It arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus by a common trunk with the circumflex nerve, and is afterwards joined by the posterior division of the trunk formed by the junction of the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. It receives filaments from the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves. At its commence- ment it is placed behind the axillary and upper part of the brachial arteries, passing down in front of the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major. It winds round the humerus in the musculo-spiral groove with the superior profunda artery, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, between the internal and ex- ternal heads of the Triceps muscle. It pierces the external intermuscular septum, and descends between the Brachialis anticus and Supinator longus to the front of the external condyle, where it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves. The branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are :— Muscular. Radial. Cutaneous. Posterior interosseous. The muscular branches are divided into internal, posterior, and external; they supply the Triceps, Anconeus, Supinator longus. Extensor carpi radialis longior, and Brachialis anticus. These branches are derived from the nerve, at the inner side, back part, and outer side of the arm. The internal muscular branches supply the inner and middle heads of the787 MUSCULO-SPIRAL Triceps muscle. That to the inner head of the Triceps is a long, slender filament, which lies close to the ulnar nerve, as far as the lower third of the arm, and is often intimately connected with it. The posterior muscular branch, of large size, arises from the nerve in the groove between the Triceps i Vim-nnvnc Tf. rliTTirloa Fig. 462.- -The suprascapular, circumflex, and musculo-spiral nerves. Siiprascapula') Circumflex Muscido-S'piTal and the humerus. It divides into branches, which supply the outer head of the Triceps and Anconeus muscles. The branch for the latter muscle is a long, slender filament, which descends in the sub- stance of the Triceps to the Anconeus. The external muscular branches supply the Supinator longus, Extensor carpi radialis longior,and (usually) the outer part of the Brachialis anticus. The cutaneous branches are three in number, one in- ternal and two external. The internal cutaneous branch arises in the axillary space, with the inner muscular branch. It is of small size, and passes through the axilla to the inner side of the arm, supplying the integument on its posterior aspect nearly as far as the olecranon. In its course it crosses beneath the intercosto-humeral, with which it communicates. The two external cutane- ous branches perforate the outer head of the Triceps, at its attachment to the humerus. The upper and smaller one passes to the front of the elbow, lying close to the ce- phalic vein, and supplies the integument of the lower half of the arm on its anterior aspect. The lower branch pierces the deep fascia below the insertion of the Deltoid, and passes down along the outer side of the arm and elbow, and then along the back part of the radial side of the forearm to the wrist, sup- plying the integument in its course, and joining, near its termination, with the posterior cutaneous branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The radial nerve passes along the front of the radial side of the forearm to the commencement of its lower third. It lies at first a Uttle to the outer side of 3 E 2 Posterior ■interosseous788 SPINAL NERVES the radial artery, concealed beneath the Supinator longns. In the middle third of the forearm, it lies beneath the same rniiscle, in close relation with the outer side of the artery. It quits the artery about three inches above the wrist, passes beneath the tendon of the Supinator longus, and, piercing the deep fascia at the outer border of the forearm, divides into two branches. The external branch, the smaller of the two, supplies the integument of the radial side and ball of the thumb, joining with the anterior branch of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. The internal branch communicates, above the wrist, with the posterior cutaneous branch from the musculo-cutaneous, and, on the back of the hand, forms an arch with the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve. It then divides into three digital nerves, which are distributed as follows : the first supplies the ulnar side of the thumb and the radial side of the index finger; the second, the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers ; and the third, the adjacent borders of the middle and ring fingers.* The latter nerve communicates with a filament from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve winds to the back of the forearm, through the fibres of the Supinator brevis, and passes down, between the superficial and deep layer of muscles, to the middle of the forearm. Considerably diminished in size, it descends on the interosseous membrane, beneath the Extensor longus pollicis, to the back of the carpus, where it presents a gangliform enlargement from which filaments are distributed to the ligaments and articulations of the carpus. It supplies all the muscles of the radial and posterior brachial regions, excepting the Anconeus, Supinator longus, and Extensor carpi radialis longior. Surgical Anatomy.—The brachial plexus may be ruptured by traction on the limb, leading to complete paralysis. In these cases the lesion would appear to be rather a tearing away of the nerves from the spinal cord, than a solution of continuity of the nerve-fibres themselves. In the axilla, any of the nerves forming the brachial plexus may be injured in a wound of this part, the median being the one which is most frequently damaged from its exposed position ; and the musculo-spiral, on account of its sheltered and deep position, being the least often wounded. The brachial plexus in the axilla is often damaged from the pressure of a crutch, producing the condition known as ' crutch paralysis.' In these cases the mnsculo-spiral appears to be the nerve which is most frequently implicated to the greatest extent; the ulnar nerve being the one that appears to suffer next in frequency. The circimijiex nerve is of particular surgical interest. On account of its course round the joint, it is liable to be torn in fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus and in dislocations of the shoulder-joint, leading to paralysis of the deltoid, and, according to Erb, inflammation of the shoulder-joint is liable to be followed by a neuritis of this nerve from extension of the inflammation to it. Mr. Hilton takes the circumflex nerve as an illustration of a law which he lays down, that ' the same trunks of nerves whose branches supply the groups of muscles moving a joint, furnish also a distribution of nerves to the skin over the insertions of the same muscles, and the interior of the joint receives its nerves from the same source.' In this way he explains the fact that an inflamed joint becomes rigid, because the same nerves which supply the interior of the joint supply the muscles also which move that jomt. The median nerve is liable to injury in wounds of the forearm. When paralysed, there is loss of flexion of the second phalanges of all the fingers, and of the terminal phalanges of the index and middle fingers. Flexion of the terminal phalanges of the ring and middle fingers is effected b}^ that portion of the Flexor profundus digitorum which is supplied by the ulnar nerve. There is power to flex the proximal phalanges through the Interossei. The thumb cannot be flexed or opposed, and is maintained in a position of extension and adduction. All power of pronation is lost. The wrist can be flexed, if the hand is first adducted, by the action of the Flexor carpi ulnaris. There is loss or impairment of sensation on the palmar surface of the thumb, index, middle, and outer half of ring fingers, and on the dorsal surface of the same fingers over the last two phalanges; except in the thumb, where the loss of sensation would be limited to the back of the last phalanx. In order to expose the median nerve, for the purpose of stretching, an incision should be made along the ulnar side of the tendon of the Palmaris longus, which serves as a guide to the nerve. * According to Hutchinson, the digital nerve to the thumb reaches only as high as the root of the nail: the one to the forefinger as high as the middle of the second phalanx : and the one to the middle and ring fingers not higher than the first phalangeal joint.— London Hosjj. Gaz. vol, iii. p. 319.DOBSAL 789 The ulnar nerve is also liable to be injured in wounds of the forearm. When paralysed, there is loss of power of flexion in the ring and little fingers ; there is impaired power of ulnar flexion and adduction; there is inability to spread out the fingers from paralysis of the Interossei; and there is inability to adduct the thumb. Sensation is lost, or impaired, in the skin supplied by the nerve. In order to expose the nerve in the lower part of the forearm, an incision should be made along the outer border of the tendon of the Flexor carpi ulnaris, and the nerve will be found lying on the ulnar side of the ulnar artery. The miiscalo-spiral nerve is probably more frequently injured than any other nerve of the upper extremity. In consequence of its close relationship to the humerus, as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove, ifc is frequently torn or injured in fractures of this bone, or subsequently involved in the callus that may be thrown out around a fracture and thus pressed upon and its functions interfered with. It is also liable to be contused against the bone by kicks or blows, or to be divided by wounds of the arm. When paralysed, the hand is flexed at the wrist and lies flaccid. This is known as ' drop wrist.' The fingers are also flexed, and on an attempt being made to extend them, the last two phalanges only will be extended, through the action of the Interossei; the first phalanges remaining flexed. There is no power of extending the wrist. Supination is completely lost when the forearm is extended on the arm, but is possible to a certain extent if the forearm is flexed so as to allow of the action of the Biceps. The power of extension of the forearm is lost on account of paralysis of the Triceps. The best position in which to expose the nerve, for the purpose of stretching, is to make an incision along the inner border of the Supinator longus, just above the level of the elbow-joint. The skin and superficial structures are to be divided and the deep fascia exposed. The white line in this structure indicating the border of the muscle is to be defined, and the deep fascia divided in this line. By now raising the Supinator longus, the nerve will be found lying beneath it, on the Brachialis anticus. DOKSAL NERVES (fig. 463) The dorsal nerves are twelve in number on each side. The first appears between the first and second dorsal vertebrae, and the last between the last dorsal and first lumbar. The roots of the dorsal nerves are of small size, and vary but slightly from the second to the last. Both roots are very slender ; the posterior roots only slightly exceeding the anterior in thickness. They gradually increase in length from above downwards, and pass down in contact with the spinal cord for a distance equal to the height of, at least, two vertebrae, in the lower part of the dorsal region, before they emerge from the spinal canal. They then join in the intervertebral foramen, and, at their exit, divide into two primary divisions, a posterior (dorsal) and an anterior (intercostal). The first and last dorsal nerves are peculiar in some respects. Posterior Divisions of the Dorsal Nerves The posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves, which are smaller than the anterior, pass backwards between the transverse processes, and divide into internal and external branches. The internal branches of the six upper nerves pass inwards between the Semi- spinalis dorsi and Multifidus spinae muscles, which they supply ; and then, piercing the origins of the Rhomboidei and Trapezius muscles, become cutaneous by the side of the spinous processes and ramify in the integument. The internal branches of the six lower nerves are distributed to the Multifidus spinae, without giving off any cutaneous filaments. The external branches increase in size from above downwards. They pass through the Longissimus dorsi, to the cellular interval between it and the Ilio- costalis, and supply those muscles, as well as their continuations upwards to the head, and the Levatores costarum ; the five or six lower nerves also give off cutaneous filaments, which pierce the Serratus posticus inferior and Latissimus dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs, and then ramify in the integument. The cutaneous branches of the dorsal nerves are twelve in number. The six upper cutaneous nerves are derived from the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves. They pierce the origins of the Rhomboidei and Trapezius muscles, and become cutaneous by the side of the spinous processes,790 SPINAL NERVES Fig. 463.—Superficial and deep distribution of the posterior branches of the spinal nerves (after Hhschfeld and Leveille).

The six lower cutaneous nerves are derived from the external branches of the posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves. They pierce the Serratus posticus inferior and Latissimus dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs, and then ramify in the integument. Anterior Divisions of the Dorsal Nerves The anterior divisions of the dorsal nerves {intercostal nerves) are twelve in number on each side. They are, for the most part, distributed to the parietes of the thorax and abdomen, separately from each other, without being joined in a plexus ; in which respect they differ from the other spinal nerves. Each nerve is connected with the adjoining ganglia of the sympathetic by one or two filaments. The intercostal nerves may be divided into two sets, from the difference they present in their distribution. The six upper, with the exception of the first and the intercosto-humeral branch of the second, are limited in their distribution to the parietes of the chest. The six lower supply the parietes of the chest and abdomen, the last one sending a cutaneous filament to the hip. The first dorsal nerve.—The anterior division of the first dorsal nerve divides into two branches: one, the larger, leaves the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib, and enters into the formation of the brachial plexus; the other and smaller branch runs along the first intercostal space, forming the first intercostal nerve, and terminates on the front of the chest, by forming the first anterior cutaneous nerve of the thorax. Occasionally this anterior cutaneous branch is wanting. The first intercostal nerve as a rule gives off no lateral cutaneous branch; but sometimes a small branch is given off', which communicates with the intercosto-humeral. The upper dorsal nerves.—The anterior divisions of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal nerves and the small branch from the first dorsal are confined to the parietes of the thorax, and are named upper or pectoral intercostal nerves. They pass forwards in the intercostal spaces with the intercostal vessels, being situated bel6w them. At the back of the chest they lie between the pleura and the External intercostal muscle, but are soon placed between the two planes of Intercostal muscles as far as the middle of the rib. They then enter the substance of the Internal intercostal muscles, and, running amidst their fibres as far as the costal cartilages, they gain the inner surface of the muscles and lie between them and the pleura. Near the sternum, they cross the internal mammary artery and Triangularis sterni muscle, pierce the Internal intercostal and Pectoralis major muscles, and supply the integument of the front of the chest and over the mammary gland, forming the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax; the branch from the second nerve becoming joined with the supraclavicular nerves of the cervical plexus. Branches.—Numerous slender muscular filaments supply the Intercostals, the Infracostales, the Levatores costarum, Serratus posticus superior, and Triangularis sterni muscles. Some of these branches, at the front of the chest, cross the costal cartilages from one to another intercostal space. Lateral cutaneous nerves.—These are derived from the intercostal nerves, midway between the vertebrae and sternum; they pierce the External intercostal and Serratus magnus muscles, and divide into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branches are reflected forwards to the side and the fore part of the chest, supplying the integument of the chest and mamma, and the upper digitations of the External oblique. The posterior branches are reflected backwards, to supply the integument over the scapula and over the Latissimus dorsi. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve is of large size, and does not divide, like the other nerves, into an anterior and posterior branch.SPINAL NERVES 792 It is named, from its origin and distribution, the iutercosto-humeral nerve (fig. 461). It pierces the External intercostal muscle, crosses the axilla to the inner side of the arm, and joins with a filament from the nerve of Wrisberg. It then pierces the fascia, and supplies the skin of the upper half of the inner and back part of the arm, communicating with the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to the size of the other cutaneous nerves, especially the nerve of Wrisberg. A second intercosto-humeral nerve is frequently given ofi" from the third intercostal. It supplies filaments to the armpit and inner side of the arm. The lower dorsal nerves.—The anterior divisions of the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh dorsal nerves are continued anteriorly from the intercostal spaces into the abdominal wall, and the twelfth dorsal is continued throughout its whole course in the abdominal wall, since it is placed below the last rib ; hence these nerves are named lotver or abdominal intercostal nerves. They have (with the exception of the last) the same arrangement as the upper ones as far as the anterior extremities of the intercostal spaces, where they pass behind the costal cartilages, and between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles, to the sheath of the Rectus, which they perforate. They supply the Rectus muscle, and terminate in branches w^hich become subcutaneous near the linea alba. These branches are named the anterior cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. They are directed outwards as far as the lateral cutaneous nerves, supplying the integument of the front of the belly. The lower intercostal nerves supply the Intercostals, Serratus posticus inferior, and Abdominal muscles, and, about the middle of their course, give oft' lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the External intercostal and External oblique muscles, in the same line as the lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax, and divide into anterior and posterior branches, which are distributed to the integument of the abdomen and back, the anterior branches passing nearly as far forwards as the margin of the Rectus; the posterior branches passing backwards to supply the skin over the Latissimus dorsi, where they join the dorsal cutaneous nerves. The last dorsal is larger than the other dorsal nerves. Its anterior division runs along the lower border of the last rib in front of the Quadratus lumborum, perforates the Transversalis, and passes forw^ards between it and the Internal oblique, to be distributed in the same manner as the lower intercostal nerves. It communicates with the ilio-hypogastric branch of the lumbar plexus, and is frequently connected with the first lumbar nerve by a slender branch, the do7^si- lunihar nerve, which descends in the substance of the Quadratus lumborum. The lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal is remarkable for its large size ; it perforates the Internal and External oblique muscles, passes downwards over the crest of the ilium in front of the iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric (fig. 470), and is distributed to the integument of the front of the hip, some of its filaments extending as low down as the trochanter major. It does not divide into an anterior and posterior branch like the other lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. Surgical Anatomy.—^The lower -seven intercostal nerves and the ilio-hypogastric, from the first lumbar nerve, supply the skin of the abdominal wall. They run downwards and inwards fairly equidistant from each other. The sixth and seventh supply the skin over the ' pit of the stomach '; the eighth corresponds to about the position of the middle linea transversa; the tenth to the umbilicus ; and the ilio-lij'pogastric supplies the skin over the pubes and external abdominal ring. There are several points of surgical import- ance about the distribution of these nerves, and it is important to remember their origin and course, for m many diseases affecting the nerve-trunks at or near the origin, the pain is referred to their peripheral terminations. Thus, in Pott's disease of the spine, children will often be brought to the surgeon suftering from pain in the belly. This is due to the fact that the nerves are irritated at the seat of disease as they issue from the spinal canal. \Vhen the irritation is confined to a single pair of nerves, the sensation complained of is often a feeling of constriction, as if a cord were tied round the abdomen, and in these cases the situation of the sense of constriction may serve to localise the disease in the spinal column. In other cases where the bone disease is more extensive, and two or more nerves are involved, a more general diffused pain in the abdomen is complained of. A similar condition is sometimes present in affections of the cord itself, as in tabes dorsalis.793 LUMBAR Again, it must be borne in mind that the same nerves which supply the skin of the abdomen supply also the planes of muscle, which constitute the greater part of the abdominal wall. Hence it follows that any irritation applied to the peripheral termina- tions of the cutaneous branches in the skin of the abdomen is immediately followed b y reflex contraction of the abdominal muscles. A good practical illustration of this may sometimes be seen in watching two surgeons examine the abdomen of the same patient. One, whose hand is cold, causes the muscles of the abdominal wall to at once contract and the belly to become rigid, and thus'not nearly so suitable for examination ; the other, who has taken the precaution to warm his hand, examines the abdomen without exciting any reflex contraction. The supply of both muscles and skin from the same source is of importance in protecting the abdominal viscera from injury. A blow on the abdomen, even of a severe character, will do no injury to the viscera if the muscles are in a condition of firm contraction; whereas in cases where the muscles have been taken unawares, and the blow has been struck while they were in a state of rest, an injury insufficient to produce any lesion of the abdominal wall has been attended with rupture of some of the abdominal contents. The importance therefore of immediate reflex contraction upon the receipt of an injury cannot be overestimated, and the intimate association of the cutaneous and muscular fibres in the same nerve produces a much more immediate response on the part of the muscles to any peripheral stimulation of the cutaneous filaments than would be the case if the two sets of fibres were derived from independent sources. Again, the nerves supplying the abdominal muscles and skin derived from the lower intercostal nerves are intimately connected with the sympathetic supplying the abdominal viscera, through the lower thoracic ganglia from which the splanchnic nerves are derived. In consequence of this, in laceration of the abdominal viscera and in acute peritonitis, the muscles of the belly wall become firmly contracted, and thus as far as possible preserve the abdominal contents in a condition of rest. LUMBAE NERVES The lumbar nerves are five in number on each side. The first appears between the first and second lumbar vertebra, and the last between the last lumbar and the base of the sacrum. The roots of the lumbar nerves are the largest, and their filaments the most numerous, of all the spinal nerves, and they are closely aggregated together upon the lower end of the cord. The anterior roots are the smaller ; but there is not the same disproportion between them and the posterior roots as in the cervical nerves. The roots of these nerves have a vertical direction, and are of considerable length, more especially the lower ones, since the spinal cord does not extend beyond the first lumbar vertebra. The roots become joined in the intervertebral foramina ; and the nerves, so formed, divide at their exit into two divisions, posterior and anterior. PosTEEioE Divisions of the Lumbar Nekves The posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves (fig. 463) diminish in size from above downwards ; they pass backwards between the transverse processes, and divide into internal and external branches. The internal branches, the smaller, pass imvards close to the articular processes of the vertebrae, and supply the Multifidus spinae and Interspinals muscles. The external branches supply the Erector spinse and Intertransverse muscles. From the three upper branches, cutaneous nerves are derived which pierce the aponeurosis of the Latissimus dorsi muscle, and descend over the back part of the crest of the ilium, to be distributed to the integument of the gluteal region, some of the filaments passing as far as the trochanter major. Anteeior Divisions of the Lumbar Nerves The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves increase in size from above downwards. At their origin, they communicate with the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic by long, slender filaments, Avhich accompany the lumbar arteries round the sides of the bodies of the vertebraB, beneath the Psoas muscle. The nerves pass obliquely outwards behind the Psoas magnus, or between its fasciculi, distributing filaments to it and the Quadratus lumborum. The anterior divisions of the four upper nerves are connected together in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the lumbar plexiLS. The anterior division of the fifth lumbar, joined with a branch794 SPINAL NERVES from the fourth, descends across the base of the sacrum to join the anterior division of the first sacral nerve, and assist in the formation of the sacral plexus. The cord resulting from the union of the fifth lumbar and the branch from the fourth is called the lumbosacral nerve. Lumbar Plexus The lumbar plexus is formed by the loops of communication between the anterior divisions of the four upper lumbar nerves. The plexus is narrow above, and often connected with the last dorsal by a slender branch, the dorsi-lumhar nerve ; it is broad below, where it is joined to the sacral plexus by the lumbo-sacral cord. It is situated in the substance of the Psoas muscle near its posterior part, in front of the transverse pro- FiG. 464.—Plan of the lumbar plexus. messes of the lumbar vertebrae. The mode in which the plexus is formed is the following :— The first lumbar nerve receives a branch from the last dorsal, and gives off a larger branch, which subdivides into the ilio- hypogastric and ilio-inguinal; a communicating branch which passes down to the second lumbar nerve ; and a third branch which unites with a branch of the second lumbar to form the genito-crural nerve. The second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves divide into an anterior and pos- terior division. The anterior division of the second divides into two branches, one of which joins with the above-mentioned branch of the first nerve to form thegenito-crural; the other unites with the anterior division of the third nerve, and a part of the anterior division of the fourth nerve to form the obturator nerve. The remainder of the anterior division of the fourth nerve passes down to communi- cate with the fifth lumbar nerve. The posterior divisions of the second and third nerve divide into two branches, a smaller branch from each uniting to form the external cutaneous nerve, and a larger branch from each, which join with the whole of the posterior division of the fourth lumbar nerve to form the anterior crural. The accessory obturator, when it exists, is formed by a small branch from the third nerve joining with a small branch from the fourth. From this arrangement it follows that the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal are derived entirely from the first lumbar nerve. The genito-crural from the first and second nerves. The external cutaneous from the second and third. The anterior crural and obturator by fibres derived from the second, third, and fourth. And the accessory obturator, when it exists, from the third and fourth. The branches of the lumbar plexus are, the Ilio-hypogastric. External cutaneous. Ilio-inguinal. Anterior crural. Genito-crural. Obturator. Accessory obturator.LUMBAR PLEXUS 795 The Ilio-hypogastric Nerve {superior musculo-cutaneous) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It emerges from the outer border of the Psoas muscle at its upper part, and crosses obliquely in front of the Quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium. It then perforates the Transversalis muscle at its posterior part, near the crest of the ilium, and divides between it and the Internal oblique into two branches, iliac and hypogastric. The iliac branch pierces the Internal and External oblique muscles immediately above the crest of the ilium, and is distributed to the integument of the gluteal region, behind the lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve (fig. 47o)- The size of this nerve bears an inverse proportion to that of the cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve. Fig. 465.—The lumbar plexus and its branches. The hypogastric branch (fig. 466) continues onwards between the Internal oblique and Transversalis muscles. It then pierces the Internal oblique, and near the middle line perforates the aponeurosis of the External oblique, about an inch above, and a little to the outer side of the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the hypogastric region. The ilio-hypogastric nerve communicates with the last dorsal and ilio-inguinal nerves. The Ilio-inguinal Nerve (inferior musculo-cutaneous), smaller than the pre- ceding, arises with it from the first lumbar nerve. It emerges from the outer border of the Psoas just below the ilio-hypogastric, and, passing obliquely across the Quadratus lumborum and Iliacus muscles, perforates the Transversalis, near the796 SPINAL NERVES fore part of the crest of the ihum, and communicates with the ilio-hypogastric nerve between that muscle and the Internal oblique. The nerve then pierces the Internal obHque, distributing filaments to it, and, accompanying the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal, it escapes at the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the upper and inner part of the thigh ; and to the scrotum in the male, and to the labium in the female. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the ilio-hypogastric. Occasionally it is very small, and ends by joining the ilio-hypogastric ; in such cases, a branch from the ilio- hypogastric takes the place of the ilio-inguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent. The Genito-criiral Nerve arises from the first and second lumbar nerves. It passes obliquely through the substance of the Psoas, descends on its surface for some distance, and divides into a genital and crural branch. The genital branch passes outwards on the Psoas magnus, and it then pierces the fascia transversalis, or passes through the internal abdominal ring, descends along the back part of the spermatic cord to the scrotum, and supplies, in the male, the Cremaster muscle. In the female, it accompanies the round ligament, and is lost upon it. The crural brancJi descends on the external iliac artery, sending a few filaments round it, and, passing beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh, enters the sheath of the femoral vessels, lying superficial and a little external to the femoral artery. It pierces the anterior layer of the sheath of the vessels, and, becoming superficial by passing through the fascia lata, it supplies the skin of the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the pelvis and knee. On the front of the thigh it communicates with the outer branch of the middle cutaneous nerve, derived from the anterior crural. A few filaments from this nerve may be traced on to the femoral artery ; they are derived from the nerve as it passes beneath Poupart's ligament. The External Cutaneous Nerve arises from the second and third lumbar nerves. It emerges from the outer border of the Psoas muscle about its middle, and crosses the Iliacus muscle obliquely, to the notch immediately beneath the anterior superior spine of the ilium, where it passes under Poupart's ligament into the thigh, and divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branch descends in an aponeurotic canal formed in the fascia lata, becomes superficial about four inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into branches which are distributed to the integument along the anterior and outer part of the thigh, as far down as the knee. This nerve occasionally communicates with a branch of the long saphenous nerve in front of the knee-joint. The posterior branch pierces the fascia lata, and subdivides into branches which pass backwards across the outer and posterior surface of the thigh, supplying the integument from the crest of the ilium as far as the middle of the thigh. The Obturator Nerve supplies the Obturator externus and Adductor muscles of the thigh, the articulations of the hip and knee, and occasionally the integument of the thigh and leg. It arises by three branches : from the third, the fourth, and the fifth lumbar nerves. It descends through the inner fibres of the Psoas muscle, and emerges from its inner border near the brim of the pelvis; it then runs along the lateral wall of the pelvis, above the obturator vessels, to the upper part of the obturator foramen, where it enters the thigh, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, separated by some of the fibres of the Obturator externus, and lower down by the Adductor brevis muscle. The anterior branch (fig. 467) passes down in front of the Adductor brevis, being covered by the Pectineus and Adductor longus ; and at the lower border of the latter muscle communicates with the internal cutaneous and internal saphenous nerves, forming a kind of plexus. It then descends upon the femoral artery, upon which it is finally distributed. The nerve, near the obturator foramen, gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint. Behind the Pectineus, it distributes muscular branches to the Adductor longus and GraciHs, and occasionally to the AdductorSPINAL NEKVES 798 brevis and Pectinens, and receives a communicating branch from the accessory obtm'ator nerve. Occasionally the communicating branch to the internal cutaneous and internal saphenous nerves is continued down, as a cutaneous branch, to the thigh and leg. When this is so, this occasional cutaneous branch emerges from beneath the lower border of the Adductor longus, descends along the posterior margin of the Sartorius to the inner side of the knee, where it pierces the deep fascia, communicates with the long saphenous nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the leg as low down as its middle. When this communicating branch is small, its place is supplied by the internal cutaneous nerve. The posterior branch of the obturator nerve pierces the Obturator externus, sending branches to supply it, and passes behind the Adductor brevis on the front of the Adductor magnus, where it divides into numerous muscular branches, which supply the Adductor magnus, and occasionally the Adductor brevis. One of the branches gives off a filament to the knee-joint. The articular branch for the knee-joint perforates the lower part of the Adductor magnus, and enters the popliteal space ; it then descends upon the popliteal artery, as far as the back part of the knee-joint, where it perforates the posterior ligament, and is distributed to the synovial membrane. It gives filaments to the artery in its course. Accessory Obturator Nerve (fig. 465) is not constantly present. It is of small size, and arises by separate filaments from the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends along the inner border of the Psoas muscle, crosses the horizontal ramus of the os pubis, and passes under the outer border of the Pectineus muscle, where it divides into numerous branches. One of these supplies the Pectineus, penetrating its under surface ; another is distributed to the hip-joint ; while a third communicates with the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. When this nerve is absent, the hip-joint receives two branches from the obturator nerve. Occasionally it is very small, and becomes lost in the capsule of the hip-joint. The Anterior Crural Nerve (figs. 465, 467) is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. It supplies muscular branches to the Iliacus, Pectineus, and all the muscles on the front of the thigh, excepting the Tensor vaginae femoris ; cutaneous filaments to the front and inner side of the thigh, and to the leg and foot; and articular branches to the hip and knee. It arises from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends through the fibres of the Psoas muscle, emerging from it at the lower part of its outer border ; and passes down between it and the Iliacus, and beneath Poupart's ligament, into the thigh, where it becomes somewhat flattened, and divides into an anterior part, which passes superficial to the external circumflex vessels, and a posterior part which passes beneath these vessels. Under Poupart's ligament, it is separated from the femoral artery by the Psoas muscle, and lies beneath the iliac fascia. Within the ijclvis the anterior crural nerve gives off from its outer side some small branches to the Iliacus, aftd a branch to the femoral artery, which is distri- buted upon the upper part of that vessel. The origin of this branch varies: it occasionally arises higher than usual, or it may arise lower down in the thigh. External to the i:)elvis the following branches are given off:— From the Anterior Divisioji From the Posterior Division Middle cutaneous. Long saphenous. Internal cutaneous. Muscular. Articular. The middle cutaneous nerve (fig. 466) pierces the fascia lata (generally the Sartorius also) about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and divides into two | branches, which descend in immediate proximity along the fore part of the thigh, I distributing numerous branches to the integument as low as the front of the j knee, where it communicates with the nervus cutaneus j^atellce, a branch of the 1 internal saphenous nerve, helping to form the patellar plexus. Its outer branch JANTERIOR CRURAL 799 communicates, above, with the craral branch of the genito-crural nerve ; and the inner branch with the internal cutaneous nerve below. The Sartorius muscle is su]3plied by this or the following nerve. The internal cutaneous nerve passes obliquely across the upper part of the sheath of the femoral artery, and divides in front, or at the inner side of that vessel, into two branches, anterior and posterior or internal. The anterior branch runs downwards on the Sartorius, perforates the fascia lata at the lower third of the thigh, and divides into two branches : one of which supplies the integument as low down as the inner side of the knee ; the other crosses to the outer side of the patella, communicating in its course with the nervus cutaneus patellae, a branch of the internal saphenous nerve. The posterior or internal branch descends along the inner border of the Sartorius muscle to the knee, where it pierces the fascia lata, communicates with the long saphenous nerve, and gives off several cutaneous branches. The nerve then passes down the inner side of the leg, to the integument of which it is distributed. This nerve, beneath the fascia lata, at the lower border of the Adductor longus, joins in a plexiform network by uniting with branches of the long saphenous and obturator nerves (fig. 467). When the communicating branch from the obturator nerve is large and continued to the integument of the leg, the inner branch of the internal cutaneous is small, and terminates at the plexus, occasionally giving off a few cutaneous filaments. The internal cutaneous nerve, before dividing, gives off' a few filaments, which pierce the fascia lata, to supply the integument of the inner side of the thigh, accompanying the long saphenous vein. One of these filaments passes through the saphenous opening ; a second becomes subcutaneous about the middle of the thigh ; and a third pierces the fascia at its lower third. The long or internal saphenous nerve is the largest of the cutaneous branches of the anterior crural. It approaches the femoral artery where this vessel passes beneath the Sartorius, and lies on its outer side, beneath the aponeurotic covering of Hunter's canal, as far as the opening in the lower part of the Adductor magnus. It then quits the artery, and descends vertically along the inner side of the knee, beneath the Sartorius, pierces the fascia lata, opposite the interval between the tendons of the Sartorius and Gracilis, and becomes subcutaneous. The nerve then passes along the inner side of the leg, accompanied by the internal saphenous vein, descends behind the internal border of the tibia, and, at the lower third of the leg, divides into two branches : one continues its course along the margin of the tibia, terminating at the inner ankle ; the other passes in front of the ankle, and is distributed to the integument along the inner side of the foot, as far as the great toe, communicating with the internal branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Branches.—The long saphenous nerve about the middle of the thigh gives off a communicating branch, which joins the plexus formed by the obturator and internal cutaneous nerves. At the inner side of the knee it gives off a large branch [nervus cutaneus patellce) which pierces the Sartorius and fascia lata, and is distributed to the integument in front of the patella. This nerve communicates above the knee with the anterior branch of the internal cutaneous and with the middle cutaneous ; below the knee, with other branches of the long saphenous ; and, on the outer side of the joint, with branches of the external cutaneous nerve, forming a plexiform network, the plexus patellcE. The cutaneous nerve of the patella is occasionally small, and terminates by joining the internal cutaneous, which supplies its place in front of the knee. Beloiu the knee, the branches of the long saphenous nerve are distributed to the integument of the front and inner side of the leg, communicating with the cutaneous branches from the internal cutaneous, or from the obturator nerve. The muscular branches supply the Pectineus and all the muscles on the front of the thigh, except the Tensor vaginas femoris which is supplied from the superior gluteal nerve, and the Sartorius which is supplied by filaments from the middle or internal cutaneous nerves.8oo SPINAL NEEVES The branches to the Pectineus, usually two in number, i^ass inwards behind the femoral vessels, and enter the muscle on its anterior surface. Sometimes one of these nerves is given off in the pelvis, and is then often united with the accessory obturator. The hrancli to the Rectus viuscle enters its under surface high up, sending oft' a small filament to the hip-joint. The hranch to the Vastus externus, of large size, follows the course of the descending branch of the external circumflex artery to the lower part of the muscle. It gives off an articular filament to the knee-joint. The branch to the Vastus internus is a long branch which runs down on the outer side of the femoral vessels in company with the internal saphenous nerve for its upper part. It enters the muscle about its middle, and gives off a filament, which can usually be traced downwards on the surface of the muscle to the knee- joint. The branch to the Grureus enters the muscle on its anterior surface about the middle of the thigh, and sends a filament through the muscle to the Subcrureus. The articular branch to the hip-joint is derived from the nerve to the Rectus. The articular branches to the knee-joint are two in number. One, a long, slender filament, is derived from the nerve to the Vastus externus. It penetrates the capsular ligament of the joint on its anterior aspect. The other is derived from the nerve to the Vastus internus. It can usually be traced downwards on the surface of this muscle to near the joint; it then penetrates the muscular fibres, and accompanies the deep branch of the anastomotica magna artery, pierces the capsular ligament of the joint on its inner side, and supplies the synovial membrane. THE SACRAL AND COCCYGEAL NERVES The sacral nerves are five in number on each side. The four upper ones pass from the sacral canal, through the sacral foramina ; the fifth through the foramen between the sacrum and coccyx. The roots of origin of the tipper sacral [and lumbar) nerves are the largest of all the spinal nerves ; whilst those of the lowest sacral and coccygeal nerve are the smallest. The roots of these nerves are of very considerable length, being longer than those of any of the other spinal nerves, on account of the spinal cord not extending beyond the first lumbar vertebra. From their great length, ajid the appearance they present in connection with the spinal cord, the roots of origin of these nerves are called collectively the cauda equina. Each sacral and coccygeal nerve divides into two divisions, posterior and anterior. The posterior divisions of the sacral nerves (fig. 468) are small, diminish in size from above downwards, and emerge, except the last, from the sacral canal by the posterior sacral foramina. The three upper ones are covered, at their exit from the sacral canal, by the Multifidus spinse, and divide into internal and external branches. The internal branches are small, and supply the Multifidus spins. The external branches join with one another, and with the last lumbar and fourth sacral nerves, by means of communicating loops. These branches pass out- wards to the outer surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they form a second series of loops beneath the Gluteus maximus. Cutaneous branches from this second series of loops, usually three in number, pierce the Gluteus maximus : one near the posterior inferior spine of the ilium ; another opposite the end of the sacrum ; and the third midway between the other two. They supply the integu- ment over the posterior part of the gluteal region. posterior divisions of the tioo lower sacral nerves are situated below the Multifidus spin^e. They are of small size, and do not divide into internal and external branches, but join with each other, and with the coccygeal nerve, so as801 SACEAL to form loops on the back of the sacrum, filaments from which supply the Extensor coccygis and the integument over the coccyx. The coccygeal nerve divides into its anterior and posterior division in the spinal canal. The ijosterior division is the smaller. It does not divide, but receives, as already mentioned, a communicating branch from the last sacral, and is lost in the fibrous structure on the back of the coccyx. The anterior divisions of the sacral nerves diminish in size from above down- wards. The four upper ones emerge from the anterior sacral foramina: the anterior division of the fifth, after emerging from the spinal canal through its terminal opening, curves forwards between the sacrum and the coccyx. All the anterior sacral nerves communicate with the sacral ganglia of the sympathetic, at their exit from the sacral foramina. ^h.Q first nerve, of large size, unites with the lumbo-sacral cord, formed by the fifth lumbar, and a branch from the fourth. The Fig. 468.—The posterior sacral nerves. second, equal in size to the preceding, and the third, about one-fourth the size of the second, unite with this trunk, and form, with a small fasciculus from the fourth, the sacral plexus, a visceral branch being given off from the third nerve to the bladder. The fourth anterior sacral nerve sends a branch to join the sacral plexus. The remaining portion of the nerve divides into visceral and muscular branches; and a communicating filament descends to join the fifth sacral nerve. The visceral branches are distributed to the viscera of the pelvis, communicating with the sympathetic nerve. These branches ascend upon the rectum and bladder, and in the female upon the vagina, communicating with branches of the sympa- thetic from the pelvic plexus. The muscular branches are distributed to the Levator ani, Coccygeus, and Sphincter ani. The branch to the Sphincter ani pierces the Levator ani, so as to reach the ischio-rectal fossa, where it is found lying in front of the coccyx. Cutaneous filaments arise from the latter branch, 3F802 SPINAL NERVES which supply the integument between the anus and coccyx. Another cutaneous branch is frequently given off from this nerve, though sometimes from the pudic (Schwalbe). It perforates the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and, winding round the lower border of the Gluteus maximus, supplies the skin over the lower and inner part of this muscle. The fifth anterior sacral nerve, after passing from the lower end of the sacral canal, curves forwards through the fifth sacral foramen, formed between the lower part of the sacrum and the transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx. It pierces the Coccygeus muscle, and descends upon its anterior surface to near the tip of the coccyx, where it again perforates the muscle, to be distributed to the integument over the back part and side of the coccyx. This nerve communicates Fig. 469.—Side view of pelvis, showing sacral nerves. above with the fourth sacral, and below with the coccygeal nerve, and supplies the Coccygeus muscle. The anterior division of the coccygeal nerve is a delicate filament which escapes at the termination of the sacral canal; it passes downwards behind the rudimentary transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx, and curves forwards, through the notch between the first and second pieces, piercing the Coccygeus muscle and descending on its anterior surface to near the tip of the coccyx, where it again pierces the muscle, to be distributed to the integument over the back part and side of the coccyx. It is joined by a branch from the fifth anterior sacral as it descends on the surface of the Coccygeus muscle. Sacral Plexus (fig. 469) The sacral plexus is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves, and part of that of the fourth. These nerves proceed in different directions; the upper ones obliquely downwards and outwards, thePUDIC 803 lower one nearly horizontally, and they all unite into a single, broad, flat cord. The sacral i^lexus is triangular in form, its base col-responding with the exit of the nerves from the sacrum, its apex with the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. It rests upon the anterior surface of the Pyriformis, and is covered in front by the pelvic fascia, which separates it from the sciatic and pudic branches of the internal iliac artery, and from the viscera of the pelvis. The branches of the sacral plexus are :— The muscular branches supply the Pyriformis, Obturator internus, the two Gemelli, and the Quadratus femoris. The branch to the Pyriformis arises either from the plexus, or from the upper sacral nerves before they enter the plexus ; the branch to the Obturator internus arises at the junction of the lumbo-sacral and first sacral nerves : it passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen to the inner surface of the Obturator internus; the branch to the Gemellus superior arises in common with the nerve to the Obturator internus : it enters the muscle at the upper part of its posterior surface ; the small branch to the Gemellus inferior and Quadratus femoris also arises from the upper part of the plexus : it passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and courses down beneath the Gemelli and tendon of the Obturator internus, and supplies the muscles on their deep or anterior surface. It gives off an articular branch to the hip-joint. This articular branch is occasionally derived from the upper part of the great sciatic nerve. The Superior Gluteal Nerve (fig. 471) arises from the back part of the lumbo- sacral cord, with some filaments from the first sacral nerve; it passes from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen above the Pyriformis muscle, accompanied by the gluteal vessels, and divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The superior branch follows the line of origin of the Gluteus minimus, and supplies the Gluteus medius. The inferior branch crosses obliquely between the Gluteus minimus and medius, distributing filaments to both these muscles, and terminates in the Tensor vaginae femoris, extending nearly to its lower end. The Inferior Gluteal arises from the lumbo-sacral cord, and first and second sacral nerves, and is intimately connected with the small sciatic at its origin. It passes out of the pelvis through the great sciatic notch, beneath the Pyriformis muscle, and dividing into a number of branches enters the Gluteus maximus muscle on its under surface. It gives off a cutaneous branch, which winds round the lower border of the Gluteus maximus muscle to supply the skin of the buttock. It is said also to give an articular branch to the hip-joint. The Pudic Nerve arises from the lower part of the sacral plexus, and leaves the pelvis, through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the Pyriformis. It then crosses the spine of the ischium, and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sacro- sciatic foramen. It accompanies the pudic vessels upwards and forwards along the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia, and divides into two terminal branches, the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis. Before its division, it gives off the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve. The inferior hcBmorrhoiclal nerve is occasionally derived separately from the sacral plexus. It passes across the ischio-rectal fossa, with its accompanying vessels, towards the lower end of the rectum, and is distributed to the integument round the anus. Branches of this nerve communicate with the inferior pudendal and superficial perineal nerves at the fore part of the perinaeum. The perineal nerve, the inferior and larger of the two terminal branches of the Muscular. Superior gluteal. Inferior gluteal. Pudic. Small sciatic.

It accompanies the superficial perineal artery in the perineum, dividing into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal) are two in number, posterior and anterior. The 'posterior or external branch passes forwards along the outer side of the perineal space parallel to the inferior pudendal nerve, and is distributed to the skin of the scrotum. It communicates with the inferior hasmorrhoidal, the inferior pudendal, and the other superficial perineal nerve. The anterior or internal branch passes forwards nearer to the middle line, to be distributed to the inner and back part of the scrotum. Both these nerves supply the labia majora in the female. The muscular branches are distributed to the Transversus perinsei, Accelerator urinas, Erector penis, and Compressor urethrse. A distinct branch is given off from the nerve to the Accelerator urinas, which pierces this muscle, and supplies the corpus spongiosum, ending in the mucous membrane of the urethra. This is the nerve to the bulb. The dorsal nerve of the penis is the deepest division of the pudie nerve ; it accompanies the pudic artery along the ramus of the ischium ; piercing the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, it runs forwards along the inner margin of the ramus of the os pubis, between the two layers of the deep fascia. It then pierces the anterior layer, and, in company with the dorsal artery of the penis, passes through the suspensory ligament, and, running forwards, is distributed to the glans. On the penis, this nerve gives off a cutaneous branch, which runs along the side of the organ; it is joined with branches of the sympathetic, and supplies the integument of the upper surface and sides of the penis and prepuce, giving a large branch to the corpus cavernosum. In the female the dorsal nerve is very small, and supplies the clitoris. The Small Sciatic Nerve (fig. 471) supplies the integument of the perinasum and back part of the thigh and leg. It is usually formed by the union of two branches, which arise from the second and third nerves of the sacral plexus. It issues from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the Pyriformis muscle, descends beneath the Gluteus maximus with the sciatic artery, and at the lower border of that muscle passes along the back part of the thigh, beneath the fascia lata, to the lower part of the popliteal region, where it pierces the fascia and becomes cutaneous. It then accompanies the external saphenous vein to about the middle of the leg, its terminal filaments communicating with the external saphenous nerve. The branches of the small sciatic nerve are all cutaneous, and consist of four groups : internal, external, ascending, and descending. The internal cutaiieous branches are distributed to the skin at the upper and inner side of the thigh, on its posterior aspect. One branch, longer than the rest, the inferior pudendal, curves forward below the tuber ischii, pierces the fascia lata, and passes forwards beneath the superficial fascia of the perinaeum to be distributed to the integument of the scrotum in the male and the labium in the female, communicating with the superficial perineal and inferior h^emorrhoidal nerves. The external cutaneous branches consist of two or three filaments, which are distributed to the skin at the upper and outer side of the thigh on its posterior aspect, as far down as the middle of that region. The ascending cutaneous branches consist of two or three filaments, which turn upwards round the lower border of the Gluteus maximus, to supply the integument covering its surface. The descending cutaneous branches are given off from the lesser sciatic nerve as it descends beneath the fascia of the thigh ; they supply the integument of the back part of the thigh, popliteal region, and upper part of the leg. The Great Sciatic Nerve (fig. 471) supplies nearly the whole of the integument of the leg, the muscles of the back of the thigh, and those of the leg and foot. It is the largest nervous cord in the body, measuring three-quarters of an inch inSPINAL NERVES 8o6 breadth, and is the continuation of the lower part of the sacral plexus. It passes out of the i^elvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the Pyriformis muscle. It descends between the trochanter major and tuberosity of the ischium, along the back part of the thigh to about its lower third, where it divides into two large branches, the internal and external j^ojjliteal nerves. This division may take place at any point between the sacral plexus and the lower third of the thigh. When the division occurs at the plexus, the two nerves descend together, side by side ; or they may be separated, at their commencement, by the interposition of part or the whole of the Pyriformis muscle. As the nerve descends along the back of the thigh, it rests at first upon the External rotator muscles, in company with the small sciatic nerve and artery, being covered by the Gluteus maximus; lower down, it lies upon the Adductor magnus, and is covered by the long head of the Biceps. The branches of the nerve, before its division, are articular and muscular. The articular branches arise from the upper part of the nerve ; they supply the hip-joint, perforating its fibrous capsule posteriorly. These branches are some- times derived from the sacral plexus. The muscular branches are distributed to the Flexors of the leg: viz. the Biceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus, and a branch to the Adductor magnus. These branches are given off beneath the Biceps muscle. The Internal Popliteal Nerve, the larger of the two terminal branches of the great sciatic, descends along the back part of the thigh, through the middle of the popliteal space to the lower part of the Popliteus muscle, where it passes with the artery beneath the arch of the Soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial. It is overlapped by the hamstring muscles above, and then becomes more superficial, and lies to the outer side of, and some distance from, the popliteal vessels ; opposite the knee-joint, it is in close relation with the vessels, and crosses to the inner side of the artery. Below, it is overlapped by the Gastrocnemius. The branches of this nerve are, articular, muscular, and a cutaneous branch the communicans jjo^litei nerve. The articular branches, usually three in number, supply the knee-joint; two of these branches accompany the superior and inferior internal articular arteries ; and a third, the azygos articular artery. The muscular branches, four or five in number, arise from the nerve as it lies between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius muscle ; they supply that muscle, the Plantaris, Soleus, and Popliteus. The filaments which supply the Popliteus turn round its lower border and are distributed to its deep surface. The communicans poplitei descends between the two heads of the Gastrocnemius muscle, and, about the middle of the back of the leg, pierces the deep fascia, and joins a communicating branch {communicans 2^eronei) from the external popliteal nerve to form the external, or short, saphenous (fig. 470). The external saphenous nerve, formed by the cutaneous branches of the internal and external popliteal nerves, passes downwards and outwards near the outer margin of the tendo Achillis, lying close to the external saphenous vein, to the interval between the external malleolus and the os calcis. It winds round the outer malleolus, and is distributed to the integument along the outer side of the foot and little toe, communicating on the dorsum of the foot with the musculo-cutaneous nerve. In the leg, its branches communicate with those of the small sciatic. The Posterior Tibial Nerve (fig. 471) commences at the lower border of the Popliteus muscle, and passes along the back part of the leg with the posterior tibial vessels to the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides into the external and internal plantar nerves. It lies upon the deep muscles of the leg, and is covered in the upper part by the muscles of the calf, lower down by the skin and fascia. In the upper part of its course, it lies to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery ; but it soon crosses that vessel, and lies to its outer side as far as the ankle. In the lower third of the leg, it is placed parallel Avith the inner margin of the tendo Achillis.EXTEENAL PLANTAR 807 Fig. 472.—The plantar nerves. Internal ylantar The branches of the posterior tibial nerve are muscular, plantar cutaneous, and articular. The muscular branches arise either separately or by a common trunk from the upper part of the nerve. They supply the Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longus hallucis muscles ; the branch to the latter muscle accompanying the peroneal artery. The plantar cutaneous branch perforates the internal annular ligament, and supplies the integument of the heel and inner side of the sole of the foot. The articular branch is given off just above the bifurcation of the nerve, and supplies the ankle-joint. The internal plantar nerve (fig. 472), the larger of the two terminal branches of the posterior tibial, accompanies the internal plantar artery along the inner side of the foot. From its origin at the inner ankle it passes beneath the Abductor hallucis, and then forwards between this muscle and the Flexor brevis digitorum, divides opposite the bases of the metatarsal bones into four digital branches, and communicates with the external plantar nerve. Branches.—In its course, the internal plantar nerve gives cutaneous branches, which pierce the plantar fascia, and supply the integument of the sole of the foot ; muscular branches, which supply the Abductor hallucis and Flexor brevis digitorum ; articular branches to the ar- ticulations of the tarsus and metatarsus ; and four digital branches. These pass between the divisions of the plantar fascia in the clefts between the toes, and are distributed in the following manner : The first supplies the inner border of the great toe, and sends a filament to the Flexor brevis hallucis muscle ; the second bifur- cates, to supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, sending a filament to the First lumbrical muscle ; the third digital branch supplies the adjacent sides of the second and third toes, and the Second lumbrical muscle; the fourth supplies the corresponding sides of the third and fourth toes, and receives a communicating branch from the external plantar nerve. It will be observed, that the distribution of these branches is pre- cisely similar to that of the median nerve in the hand. Each digital nerve gives off cutaneous and articular filaments; and opposite the last phalanx sends a dorsal branch, which supplies the structure round the nail, the continuation of the nerve being distributed to the ball of the toe. The external plantar nerve, the smaller of the two, completes the nervous supply to the structures of the sole of the foot, being distributed to the little toe and one-half of the fourth, as well as to most of the deep muscles, its distribution being similar to that of the ulnar in the hand. It passes obliquely forwards with the external plantar artery to the outer side of the foot, lying between the Flexor brevis digitorum and Flexor accessorius ; and, in the interval between the former muscle and Abductor minimi digiti, divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Before its division, it supplies the Flexor accessorius and Abductor minimi digiti. The superficial branch separates into two digital nerves : one, the smaller of Beep h ranch8o8 SPINAL NERVES the two, supplies the outer side of the little toe, the Flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the two Interosseous muscles of the fourth metatarsal space ; the other and larger digital branch supplies the adjoining sides of the fourth and fifth toes, and com- municates with the internal plantar nerve. The deep or muscular branch accompanies the external plantar artery into the deep part of the sole of the foot, beneath the tendons of the Flexor muscles and Adductor transversus hallucis, and supplies all the Interossei (except those in the fourth metatarsal space), the two outer Lumbricales, the Adductor obliquus hallucis, and the Adductor transversus hallucis. The External Popliteal or Peroneal Nerve (fig. 471), about one-half the size of the internal popliteal, descends obliquely along the outer sides of the popliteal space to the head of the fibula, close to the inner margin of the Biceps muscle. It is easily felt beneath the skin behind the head of the fibula, at the inner side of the tendon of the Biceps. It passes between the tendon of the Biceps and outer head of the Gastrocnemius muscle, winds round the neck of the fibula, pierces the origin of the Peroneus longus, and divides beneath that muscle into the anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous nerves. The branches of the peroneal nerve, previous to its division, are articular and cutaneous. The articular branches are three in number ; two of these accompany the superior and inferior external articular arteries to the outer side of the knee. The upper one occasionally arises from the great sciatic nerve before its bifurcation. The third [recurrent) articular nerve is given off at fbe point of division of the peroneal nerve ; it ascends with the anterior recurrent tibial artery through the Tibialis anticus muscle to the front of the knee, which it supplies. The cutaneous branches, two or three in number, supply the integument along the back part and outer side of the leg, as far as its middle or lower part; one of these, larger than the rest, the communicans peronei, arises near the head of the fibula, crosses the external head of the Gastrocnemius to the middle of the leg, and joins with the communicans poplitei to form the external saphenous. This nerve occasionally exists as a separate branch, which is continued down as far as the heel. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (fig. 467) commences at the bifurcation of the peroneal nerve, between the fibula and upper part of the Peroneus longus, passes obliquely forw^ards beneath the Extensor longus digitorum to the fore part of the interosseous membrane, and reaches the outer side of the anterior tibial artery above the middle of the leg ; it then descends with the artery to the front of the ankle-joint, where it divides into an external and an internal branch. This nerve lies at first on the outer side of the anterior tibial artery, then in front of it, and again at its outer side at the ankle-joint. The branches of the anterior tibial nerve, in its course through the leg, are the mus- cular branches to the Tibialis anticus. Extensor longus digitorum, Peroneus tertius, and Extensor proprius hallucis muscles, and an articular branch to the ankle-joint. The external or tarsal branch of the anterior tibial passes outwards across the tarsus, beneath the Extensor brevis digitorum, and, having become ganglionic like the posterior interosseous nerve at the wrist, supplies the Extensor brevis digitorum. From the ganglion are given off three minute interosseous branches which supply the tarsal joints and the metatarso-phalangeal joints of the second, third, and fourth toes. The first of these sends a filament to the second dorsal interosseous muscle. The internal branch, the continuation of the nerve, accompanies the dorsalis pedis artery along the inner side of the dorsum of the foot, and, at the first inter- osseous space, divides into two branches, wdiich supply the adjacent sides of the great and second toes, communicating with the internal branch of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. Before it divides it gives off an interosseous branch to the first space, which supplies the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe and sends a filament to the First dorsal interosseous muscle. The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve (fig. 467) supplies the muscles on the fibular side of the leg, and the integument of the dorsum of the foot. It passes forwardsSUEGICAL ANATOMY between the Peronei muscles and the Extensor longus digitorum, pierces the deep fascia at the lower third of the leg, on its front and outer side, and divides into two branches. This nerve, in its course between the muscles, gives off muscular branches to the Peroneus longus and brevis, and cutaneous filaments to the integument of the lower part of the leg. The internal branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve passes in front of the ankle-joint, and along the dorsum of the foot, supplying the inner side of the great toe, and the adjoining sides of the second and third toes. It also supplies the integument of the inner ankle and inner side of the foot, communicating with the internal saphenous nerve, and joins with the anterior tibial nerve, between the great and second toes. The external branch, the larger, passes along the outer side of the dorsum of the foot, to be distributed to the adjoining sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. It also supplies the integument of the outer ankle and outer side of the foot, com- municating with the short saphenous nerve. The distribution of these branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve will be found to vary; together, they supply all the toes excepting the outer side of the little toe, and the adjoining sides of the great and second toes, the former being supplied by the external saphenous, and the latter by the internal branch of the anterior tibial. Surgical Anatomy.—The lumbar plexus passes through the Psoas muscle, and, there- fore, in psoas abscess, any or all of its branches may be irritated, causing severe pain in the part to which the irritated nerves are distributed. The genito-crural nerve is the one which is most frequently implicated. This nerve is also of importance, as it is concerned in one of the principal reflexes employed in the investigation of diseases of the spine. It the skin over the inner side of the thigh just below Poupart's ligament, the part supplied by the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, be gently tickled in a male child, the testicle will be noticed to be drawn upwards, through the action of the Cremaster muscle, supplied by the genital branch of the same nerve. The same result may sometimes be noticed in adults, and can almost always be produced by severe stimulation. This reflex, when present, shows that the portion of the cord from which the first and second lumbar nerves are derived is in a normal condition. The anterior crm-al nerve is in danger of being injured in fractures of the true pelvis, since the fracture most commonly takes place through the horizontal ramus of the os pubis, at or near the point where this nerve crosses the bone. It is also liable to be injured in fractm-es and dislocations of the femur, and is likely to be pressed upon, and its functions impaired, in some tumours growing in the pelvis. Moreover, on account of its superficial position, it is exposed to injury in wounds and stabs in the groin. "When this nerve is paralysed, the patient is unable to flex his hip completely, on account of the loss of motion in the Iliacus ; or to extend the knee on the thigh, on account of paralysis of the Quadriceps extensor cruris ; there is complete paralysis of the Sartorius, and partial paralysis of the Pectineus. There is loss of sensation down the front and inner side of the thigh, except in that part supplied by the crural branch of the genito-crural, and by the iho-inguinal. There is also loss of sensation down the inner side of the leg and foot as far as the ball of the great toe. The obturator nerve is of special surgical interest. It is rarely paralysed alone, but occasionally in association with the anterior crural. The principal interest attached to it is in connection with its supply to the knee ; pain in the knee being symptomatic of many diseases in which the trunk of this nerve, or one of its branches, is irritated. Thus it is well known that in the earlier stages of hip-joint disease the patient does not complain of pain in that articulation, but on the inner side of the knee, or in the knee- joint itself, both these articulations being supplied by the obturator nerve, the final distribution of the nerve being to the knee-joint. Again, the same thing occurs in sacro- iliac disease : pain is complained of in the knee-joint, or on its inner side. The obtur- ator nerve is in close relationship with the sacro-iliac articulation, passing over it, and, according to some anatomists, distributing filaments to it. Again, in cancer of the sigmoid flexure, and even in cases where masses of hardened faeces are impacted in this portion of the gut, pain is complained of in the knee. The obturator nerve lies beneath the sigmoid flexure, and is readily pressed upon and irritated when disease exists in this part of the intestine. Finally, pain in the knee forms an important diagnostic sign in obtur- ator hernia. The hernial protrusion as it passes out through the opening in the obturator membrane presses upon the nerve and causes pain in the parts supplied by its peripheral filaments. When the obturator nerve is paralysed, the patient is unable to press his knees together or to cross one leg over the other, on account of paralysis of the Adductor muscles. Potation outwards of the thigh is impaired from paralysis of the Obturator externus. Sometimes there is loss of sensation in the upper half of the inner side of the leg.8io SYMPATHETIC NERVE Sacral „ . . 4 or 5 ,, ,, The great sciatic nerve is liable to be pressed upon by various forms of pelvic tumours, giving rise to pain along its trunk, to which the term sciatica is aj)plied. Tumours growing from the pelvic viscera, or bones, aneurisms of some of the branches of the internal iliac artery, calculus in the bladder when of large size, accumulation of faeces in the rectum, may all cause pressure on the nerve inside the pelvis, and give rise to sciatica. Outside the pelvis exposure to cold, violent movements of the hip-joint, exostoses or other tumours growing from the margin of the sacro-sciatic foramen, may also give rise to the same condi- tion. When paralysed there is loss of motion in all the muscles below the knee, and loss of sensation in the same situation, except the upper half of the back of the leg, supplied by the small sciatic and the upper half of the inner side of the leg, when the communicating branch of the obtiu-ator is large (see page 798). The sciatic nerve has been frequently cut down upon and stretched, or has been acu- punctured for the relief of sciatica. The nerve has also been stretched in cases of locomotor ataxy, the anaesthesia of leprosy, etc. In order to define it on the surface, a point is taken at the junction of the middle and lower third of a line stretching from the posterior superior spine of the ilium to the outer part of the tuber ischii, and a line drawn from this to the middle of the upper part of the popliteal space. The line must be slightly- curved with its convexit}^ outwards, and as it passes downwards to the lower border of the Gluteus maximus is slightly nearer the tuber ischii than the great trochanter, as it bisects a line drawn between these two points. The operation of stretching the sciatic nerve is performed by making an incision over the course of the nerve about the centre of the thigh. The skin, superficial structures, and deep fascia having been divided, the interval between the inner and outer hamstrings is to be defined, and these muscles pulled inwards and outwards with retractors. The nerve will be found a little to the inner side of the Biceps. It is to be separated from the sarrounding structures, hooked up with the finger, and stretched by steady and continuous traction for two or three minutes. The sciatic nerve may also be stretched by what is known as the ' dry ' plan. The patient is laid on his back, the foot is extended, the leg fiexed on the thigh, and the thigh strongly fiexed on the abdomen. While the thigh is maintained in this position, the leg is forcibly extended to its full extent, and the foot as fully flexed on the leg. The position of the external popliteal, close behind the tendon of the Biceps on the outer side of the ham, should be remembered in subcutaneous division of the tendon. After it is divided, a cord otten rises up close beside it, which might be mistaken for a small undivided portion of the tendon, and the surgeon might be tempted to reintroduce his knife and divide it. This must never be done, as the cord is the external popliteal nerve, which becomes prominent as soon as the tendon is divided. THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE The Sympathetic Nervous System consists of (i) a series of ganglia, connected together by intervening cords, extending from the base of the skull to the coccyx, one on each side of the middle line of the body, partly in front and partly on each side of the vertebral column ; (2) of three great gangliated plexuses, or aggregations of nerves and ganglia, situated in front of the spine in the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities respectively; (3) of smaller ganglia situated in relation with the abdominal viscera; and (4) of numerous nerve-fibres. These latter are of two kinds : communicating, by w^hich the ganglia communicate with each other and with the cerebro-spinal nerves ; and distributory, supplying, in general, all the internal viscera and the coats of the blood-vessels. Each gangliated cord may be traced upwards from the base of the skull into its cavity by an ascending branch, which passes through the carotid canal, forms a plexus on the internal carotid artery, and communicates wdth the ganglia on the first and second divisions of the fifth nerve. According to some anatomists, the two cords are joined, at their cephalic extremities, by these ascending branches communicating in a small ganglion (the ganglion of Bibes), situated upon the anterior communicating artery. The ganglia of these cords are distinguished as cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral, and except in the neck they correspond pretty nearly in number to the vertebrae against which they lie. They may be thus arranged :— Cervical portion . . 3 pairs of ganglia. Dorsal „ . . 12 „ Lmnbar . . 4 „SYMPATHETIC NERVE 8l2 In the neck they are situated in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrae; in the dorsal region, in front of the heads of the ribs; in the lumbar region, on the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae ; and in the sacral region, in front of the sacrum. As the two cords pass into the pelvis, they converge and unite together in a single ganglion (ganglion impar), placed in front of the coccyx. Each ganglion may be regarded as a distinct centre, and, in addition to its branches of distribution, possesses also branches of communication, which communicate with other ganglia and with the cerebro-spinal nerves. The branches of communication between the ganglia are composed of grey and white nerve-fibres, the latter being continuous with those fibres of the spinal nerves which pass to the ganglia. The branches of communication between the ganglia and the cerebro-spinal nerves also consist of a white and grey portion; the former proceeding from the spinal nerve to the ganglion, the latter passing from the ganglion to the spinal nerve, so that a double interchange takes place between the two systems. The three great gangliated plexuses are situated in front of the spine in the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions, and are named respectively, the cardiac, the solar or epigastric, and the hypogastric plexus. They consist of collections of nerves and ganglia ; the nerves being derived from the gangliated cords, and from the cerebro-spinal nerves. They distribute branches to the viscera. Smaller ganglia are also found lying amidst the nerves, some of them of microscopic size, in certain viscera—as, for instance, in the heart, the stomach, and the uterus. They serve as additional centres for the origin of nerve-fibres. The branches of distribtition derived from the gangliated cords, from the prevertebral plexuses, and also from the smaller ganglia, are principally destined for the blood-vessels and thoracic and abdominal viscera, supplying the involuntary muscular fibre of the coats of the vessels and the hollow viscera, and the secreting cells, as well as the muscular coats of the vessels in the glandular viscera. In addition to these various divisions of the sympathetic, the ganglia con- nected with the three branches of the fifth cranial nerve are believed by some to constitute a part of the sympathetic system. These ganglia have already been described (page 742 seq.). Cervical Portion of the Gangliated Cord The cervical portion of the gangliated cord consists of three ganglia on each side, which are distinguished, according to their position, as the superior, middle, and inferior cervical. The Superior Cervical Ganglion, the largest of the three, is placed opposite the second and third cervical vertebrae, and sometimes as low as the fourth or fifth. It is of a reddish-grey colour, and usually fusiform in shape; sometimes broad, and occasionally constricted at intervals, so as to give rise to the opinion that it consists of the coalescence of several smaller ganglia ; and it is usually believed that it is formed by the coalescence of the four ganglia, corresponding to the four upper cervical nerves. It is in relation, in front, with the sheath of the internal carotid artery, and internal jugular vein ; behind, it lies on the Rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Its branches may be divided into superior, inferior, external, internal, and anterior. The superior branch appears to be a direct prolongation of the ganglion. It is soft in texture, and of a reddish colour. It ascends by the side of the internal carotid artery, and, entering the carotid canal in the temporal bone, divides into two branches, which lie, one on the outer, and the other on the inner side of that vessel. The oiUer branch, the larger of the two, distributes filaments to the internal carotid artery, and forms the carotid plexus. The inner branch also distributes filaments to the internal carotid, and, con- tinuing onw^ards, forms the cavernous plexus.CERVICAL PORTION 813 Fig. 474.—Plan of the cervical portion of the sympathetic. (After Flower.)SYMPATHETIC NEKVE 8i4 Carotid Plexus The carotid plexus is situated on the outer side of the internal carotid. Fila- ments from this plexus occasionally form a small gangiiform swelling on the under surface of the artery, Avhich is called the carotid ganglion. The carotid plexus communicates with the Gasserian ganglion, with the sixth nerve, and the spheno- palatine ganglion, and distributes filaments to the wall of the carotid artery, and to the dura mater (Valentin) ; while in the carotid canal it communicates with Jacobson's nerve, the tympanic branch of the giosso-pharyngeal. The communicating branches with the sixth nerve consist of one or two filaments which join that nerve as it lies upon the outer side of the internal carotid. Other filaments are also connected with the Gasserian ganglion. The communication with the spheno-palatine ganglion is effected by a branch, the large deep petrosal, which is given off from the plexus on the outer side of the artery, and which passes through the cartilage filling up the foramen lacerum medium, and joins the great superficial petrosal to form the Vidian nerve. The Vidian nerve then proceeds along the pterygoid or Vidian canal to the spheno- palatine ganglion. The communication with Jacobson's nerve is effected by two branches, one of which is called the small deep petrosal nerve, and the other the long petrosal. Cavernous Plexus The cavernous plexus is situated below, and internal to that part of the internal carotid which is placed by the side of the sella Turcica, in the cavernous sinus, and is formed chiefly by the internal division of the ascending branch from the superior cervical ganglion. It communicates with the third, the fourth, the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the sixth nerves, and with the ophthalmic ganglion, and distributes filaments to the wall of the internal carotid. The branch of communication with the third nerve joins it at its point of division ; the branch to the fourth nerve joins it as it lies on the outer wall of the cavernous sinus; other filaments are connected with the under surface of the trunk of the ophthalmic nerve ; and a second filament of communication joins the sixth nerve. The filament of connection with the ophthalmic ganglion arises from the anterior part of the cavernous plexus ; it accompanies the nasal nerve, or continues forwards as a separate branch. The terminal filaments from the carotid and cavernous plexuses are prolonged along the internal carotid, forming plexuses which entwine round the cerebral and ophthalmic arteries ; along the former vessels they may be traced on to the pia mater; along the latter, into the orbit, where they accompany each of the sub- divisions of the vessel, a separate plexus passing, with the arteria centralis retinae, into the interior of the eyeball. The filaments prolonged on to the anterior communicating artery form a small ganglion, the ganglioji of Bibes* which serves, as mentioned above, to connect the sympathetic nerves of the right and left sides. The inferior or descending branch of the superior cervical ganglion commu- nicates with the middle cervical ganglion. The external branches are numerous, and communicate with the cranial nerves, and with the four upper spinal nerves. Sometimes the branch to the fourth spinal nerve may come from the cord connecting the upper and middle cervical ganglia. The branches of communication with the cranial nerves consist of delicate filaments, which pass from the superior cervical ganglion to the ganglion of the trunk of the pneumogastric, and to the hypoglossal nerve. A separate filament from the cervical ganghon subdivides and joins the petrosal ganghon of the giosso-pharyngeal, and the ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric in the jugular foramen. The internal branches are three in number : the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and superior cardiac nerve. The pharyngeal branches pass inwards to the side of the The existence of this ganglion is doubted by some observers.815 MIDDLE CERVICAL GANGLION pharynx, where they join with branches from the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and external laryngeal nerves to form the pharyngeal plexus. The laryngeal brandies miite with the superior laryngeal nerve and its branches. The superior cardiac nerve {nervus superficialis cordis) arises by two or more branches from the superior cervical ganglion, and occasionally receives a filament from the cord of communication between the first and second cervical ganglia. It runs down the neck behind the common carotid artery, lying upon the Longus colli muscle ; and crosses in front of the inferior thyroid artery, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. The right superior cardiac nerve, at the root of the neck, passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery, and along the arteria innominata, to the back part of the arch of the aorta, where it joins the deep cardiac plexus. This nerve, in its course, is connected with other branches of the sympathetic ; about the middle of the neck it receives filaments from the external laryngeal nerve; lower down, one or two twigs from the pneumogastric ; and as it enters the thorax it is joined by a filament from the recurrent laryngeal. Filaments from this nerve communicate with the thyroid branches from the middle cervical ganglion. The left superior cardiac nerve, in the chest, runs by the side of the left common carotid artery, and in front of the arch of the aorta, to the superficial cardiac plexus; but occasionally it passes behind the aorta, and terminates in the deep cardiac plexus. The anterior branches ramify upon the external carotid artery and its branches, forming round each a delicate plexus, on the nerves composing which small ganglia are occasionally found. These ganglia have been named, according to their posi- tion, intercarotid * (placed at the angle of bifurcation of the common carotid), lingual, temporal, and pharyngeal. The plexuses accompanying some of these arteries have important communications with other nerves. That surrounding the external carotid is connected with the branch of the facial nerve to the stylo-hyoid muscle; that surrounding the facial communicates with the submaxillary ganglion by one or two filaments; and that accompanying the middle meningeal artery sends offsets which pass to the otic ganglion and to the intumescentia gangliof ormis of the facial nerve (external petrosal). The Middle Cervical Ganglion {thyroid ganglion) is the smallest of the three cervical ganglia, and is occasionally altogether wanting. It is placed opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, usually upon, or close to, the inferior thyroid artery ; hence the name ' thyroid ganglion,' assigned to it by Haller. It is probably formed by the coalescence of two ganglia corresponding to the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Its superior branches ascend to communicate with the superior cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend to communicate with the inferior cervical ganglion. Its external branches pass outwards to join the fifth and sixth spinal nerves. These branches are not constantly found. Its internal branches are the thyroid and the middle cardiac nerve. The thyroid branches are small filaments, which accompany the inferior thyroid artery to the thyroid gland ; they communicate, on the artery, with the superior cardiac nerve, and, in the gland, with branches from the recurrent and external laryngeal nerves. The middle cardiac nerve {nervus cardiacus magnus), the largest of the three cardiac nerves, arises from the middle cervical ganglion, or from the cord between the middle and inferior ganglia. On the right side it descends behind the common carotid artery ; and at the root of the neck passes either in front of or behind the subclavian artery ; it then descends on the trachea, receives a few filaments from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and joins the deep cardiac plexus. In the neck, it communicates with the superior cardiac and recurrent laryngeal nerves. On the left side, the middle cardiac nerve enters the chest between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and joins the left side of the deep cardiac plexus. * This ganglion is of the same strLicture as the coccygeal gland (Luschka).8i6 SYMPATHETIC NEEVE The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is situated between the base of the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, on the inner side of the superior intercostal artery. Its form is irregular; it is larger in size than the preceding, and frequently joined with the first thoracic ganglion. It is probably formed by the coalescence of two ganglia which correspond to the two last cervical nerves. Its sttjjerior branches communicate with the middle cervical ganglion. Its inferior branches descend, some in front of, others behind the subclavian artery, to join the first thoracic ganglion. Its internal branch is the inferior cardiac nerve. The inferior cardiac nerve [nervus cardiacus minor) arises from the inferior cervical or first thoracic ganglion. It passes down behind the subclavian artery and along the front of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus. It communi- cates freely behind the subclavian artery with the recurrent laryngeal and middle cardiac nerves. The external branches consist of several filaments, some of which communi- cate with the seventh and eighth spinal nerves ; others accompany the vertebral artery along the vertebral canal, forming a plexus round the vessel, supplying it with filaments, and communicating with the cervical spinal nerves as high as the fourth. Thoracic Portion of the Gangliated Cord The thoracic portion of the gangliated cord consists of a series of ganglia, which usually correspond in number to that of the vertebrae; but, from the occasional coalescence of two, their number is uncertain. These ganglia are placed on each side of the spine, resting against the heads of the ribs, and covered by the pleura costalis ; the last two are, however, anterior to the rest, being placed on the side of the bodies of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae. The ganglia are small in size, and of a greyish colour. The first, larger than the rest, is of an elongated form, and frequently blended with the last cervical. They are connected together by cord-like prolongations from their substance. The external branches from each ganglion, usually two in number, communi- cate with each of the dorsal spinal nerves. The internal branches from the six upper ganglia are very small; they supply filaments to the thoracic aorta and its branches, besides small branches to the bodies of the vertebrae and their ligaments. Branches from the third and fourth, and sometimes, also, from the first and second ganglia form part of the posterior pulmonary plexus. The internal branches from the six lower ganglia are large and white in colour ; they distribute filaments to the aorta, and unite to form the three splanchnic nerves. These are named, the great, the lesser, and the smallest or renal splanchnic. The great splanchnic nerve is of a white colour, firm in texture, and bears a marked contrast to the ganglionic nerves. It is formed by branches from the thoracic ganglia between the sixth and tenth, receiving filaments (according to Dr. Beck) from all the thoracic ganglia above the sixth. These roots unite to form a large round cord of considerable size. It descends obliquely inwards in front of the bodies of the vertebrae along the posterior mediastinum, perforates the crus of the Diaphragm, and terminates in the semilunar ganglion, distributing filaments to the renal and suprarenal plexus. The lesser splanchnic nerve is formed by filaments from the tenth and eleventh ganglia, and from the cord between them. It pierces the Diaphragm with the preceding nerve, and joins the coeliac plexus. It communicates in the chest with the great splanchnic nerve, and occasionally sends filaments to the renal plexus. The smallest, or renal splanchnic nerve arises from the last ganglion, and, piercing the Diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus and lower part of the coeliac plexus. It occasionally communicates with the preceding nerve. A striking analogy appears to exist between the splanchnic and the cardiacGREAT PLEXUSES OF THE SYMPATHETIC 817 nerves. The cardiac nerves are three in number ; they arise from the three cervical ganglia, and are distributed to a large and important organ in the thoracic cavity. The splanchnic nerves, also three in number, are connected probably with all the dorsal ganglia, and are distributed to important organs in the abdominal cavity. The Lumbar Portion of the Gangliatbd Cord The lumbar portion of the gangliated cord is situated in front of the vertebral column, along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle. It consists usually of four ganglia, connected together by interganglionic cords. The ganglia are of small size, of a greyish colour, shaped like a barleycorn, and placed much nearer the median line than the thoracic ganglia. The superior and inferior branches of the lumbar ganglia serve as communi- cating branches between the chain of ganglia in this region. They are usually single, and of a white colour. The external branches communicate with the lumbar spinal nerves. From the situation of the lumbar ganglia, these branches are longer than in the other regions. They are usually two in number from each ganglion, but their connection with the spinal nerves is not so uniform as in other regions. They accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, passing beneath the fibrous arches from which some of the fibres of the Psoas muscle arise. Of the internal brcmches, some pass inwards, in front of the aorta, and help to form the aortic plexus. Other branches descend in front of the common iliac arteries, and join over the promontory of the sacrum, helping to form the hypo- gastric plexus. Numerous delicate filaments are also distributed to the bodies of the vertebrae, and the ligaments connecting them. Pelvic Portion of the Gangliated Cord The pelvic portion of the gangliated cord is situated in front of the sacrum, along the inner side of the anterior sacral foramina. It consists of four or five small ganglia on each side, connected together by interganglionic cords. Below, these cords converge and unite on the front of the coccyx, by means of a small ganglion (the coccygeal ganglion, or ganglion impar). The superior and inferior branches are the cords of communication between the ganglia above and below. The external branches, exceedingly short, communicate with the sacral nerves. They are two in number from each ganglion. The coccygeal nerve communicates either with the last sacral, or coccygeal ganglion. The internal branches communicate, on the front of the sacrum, with the corresponding branches from the opposite side; some, from the first two ganglia, pass to join the pelvic plexus, and others form a plexus, which accompanies the middle sacral artery, and sends filaments to the coccygeal gland. THE GREAT PLEXUSES OF THE] SYMPATHETIC The great plexuses of the sympathetic are the large aggregations of nerves and ganglia, above alluded to, situated in the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities respectively. From them are derived the branches which supply the viscera. The Cardiac Plexus The cardiac plexus is situated at the base of the heart, and is divided into a superficial part, which lies in the concavity of the arch of the aorta, and a deei:> part, which lies between the trachea and aorta. The great or deep cardiac plexus {plexus magnus profundus, Scarpa) is situated in front of the trachea at its bifurcation, above the point of division of 3G4 8i8 SYMPATHETIC NERVE the pulmonary artery, and behind the arch of the aorta. It is formed by the cardiac nerves derived from the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, and the cardiac branches of the recurrent laryngeal and pneumogastric. The only cardiac nerves which do not enter into the formation of this plexus are the left superior cardiac nerve, and the left inferior cervical cardiac branch from the pneumogastric. The branches from the right side of this plexus pass, some in front of, and others behind, the right pulmonary artery ; the former, the more numerous, transmit a few filaments to the anterior pulmonary plexus, and are then continued onwards to form part of the anterior coronary plexus ; those behind the pulmonary artery distribute a few filaments to the right auricle, and are then continued omvards to form part of the posterior coronary plexus. The branches from the left side of the deep cardiac plexus distribute a few filaments to the superficial cardiac plexus, to the left auricle of the heart, and to the anterior pulmonary plexus, and then pass on to form the greater part of the posterior coronary plexus. The superficial (anterior) cardiac plexus lies beneath the arch of the aorta, in front of the right pulmonary artery. It is formed by the left superior cardiac nerve, the left (and occasionally the right) inferior cervical cardiac branches of the pneumogastric, and filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. A small ganglion [cardiac ganglion of Wrisherg) is occasionally found connected with these nerves at their point of junction. This ganglion, when present, is situated immediately beneath the arch of the aorta, on the right side of the ductus arteriosus. The superficial cardiac plexus forms the chief part of the anterior coronary plexus, and several filaments pass along the pulmonary artery to the left anterior pulmonary plexus. The posterior coronary plexus is chiefly formed by filaments prolonged from the left side of the deep cardiac plexus, and by a few from the right side. It surrounds the branches of the coronary artery at the back of the heart, and its filaments are distributed with those vessels to the muscular substance of the ventricles. The anterior coronary plexus is formed chiefly from the superficial cardiac plexus, but receives filaments from the deep cardiac plexus. Passing forwards between the aorta and pulmonary artery, it accompanies the left coronary artery on the anterior surface of the heart. Valentin has described nervous filaments ramifying under the endocardium ; and Remak has found, in several mammalia, numerous small ganglia on the cardiac nerves, both on the surface of the heart and in its muscular substance. The Epigastric or Solar Plexus (fig. 473, 475) The Epigastric or Solar plexus supplies all the viscera in the abdominal cavity. It consists of a great network of nerves and ganglia, situated behind the stomach and in front of the aorta and crura of the Diaphragm. It surrounds the coeliac axis and root of the superior mesenteric artery, extending downwards as low as the pancreas, and outwards to the suprarenal capsules. This plexus, and the ganglia connected with it, receive the great splanchnic nerve of both sides, and some filaments from the right pneumogastric. It distributes filaments, which accompany, under the name of plexuses, all the branches from the front of the abdominal aorta. The semilunar ganglia of the solar plexus, two in number, one on each side, are the largest ganglia in the body. They are large irregular gangliform masses, formed by the aggregation of smaller ganglia, having interspaces between them. They are situated in front of the crura of the Diaphragm, close to the suprarenal capsules : the one on the right side lies beneath the inferior vena cava ; the upper part of each ganglion is joined by the greater splanchnic nerve, and to the inner side of each the branches of the solar plexus are connected. From the epigastric or solar plexus are derived the following :—THE EPIGASTEIG OR SOLAR PLEXUS 8,9 Phrenic or Diaphragmatic plexus. f Gastric plexus. Suprarenal plexus. Coeliac plexus < Splenic plexus. Renal plexus. L Hepatic plexus. Spermatic plexus. Superior mesenteric plexus. Aortic plexus. The phrenic plexus accompanies the phrenic artery to the Diaphragm, which it supplies ; some filaments passing to the suprarenal capsule. It arises from the upper part of the semilunar ganglion, and is larger on the right than on the left side. It receives one or two branches from the phrenic nerve. In connection with this plexus, on the right side, at its point of junction with the phrenic nerve, is a small ganglion (ganglion diaphretgmaticum). This ganglion is placed on the under surface of the Diaphragm, near the suprarenal capsule. Its branches are distributed to the inferior vena cava, suprarenal capsule, and the hepatic plexus. There is no ganglion on the left side. The suprarenal plexus is formed by branches from the solar plexus, from the semilunar ganglion, and from the phrenic and great splanchnic nerves, a ganglion being formed at the point of junction of the latter nerve. It supplies the supra- renal capsule. The branches of this plexus are remarkable for their large size, in comparison with the size of the organ they supply. The renal plexus is formed by filaments from the solar plexus, the outer part of the semilunar ganglion, and the aortic plexus. It is also joined by filaments from the lesser and smallest splanchnic nerves. The nerves from these sources, fifteen or twenty in number, have numerous ganglia developed upon them. They accompany the branches of the renal artery into the kidney ; some filaments on the right side being distributed to the inferior vena cava, and others to the spermatic plexus, on both sides. The spermatic plexus is derived from the renal plexus, receiving branches from the aortic plexus. It accompanies the spermatic vessels to the testes. In the female, the ovarian plexus is distributed to the ovaries and fundus of the uterus. The coeliac plexus, of large size, is a direct continuation from the solar plexus : it surrounds the coeliac axis, and subdivides into the gastric, hepatic, and splenic plexuses. It receives branches from the lesser splanchnic nerves, and, on the left side, a filament from the right pneumogastric. The gastric or coronary plexus accompanies the gastric artery along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and joins with branches from the left pneumogastric nerve. It is distributed to the stomach. The hepatic plexus, the largest offset from the coeliac plexus, receives filaments', from the left pneumogastric and right phrenic nerves. It accompanies the hepatic artery, ramifying in the substance of the liver upon its branches, and upon those of the vena portas. Branches from this plexus accompany all the divisions of the hepatic artery. Thus there is a pyloric plexus accompanying the pyloric branch of the hepatic, which joins with the gastric plexus and pneumogastric nerves^ There is also a gastro-duodenal plexus, which subdivides into the pancreatico-duodenal plexus, which accompanies the pancreatico-duodenal artery, to supply the pancreas and duodenum, joining with branches from the mesenteric plexus ; and a gastro-epiploio plexus, which accompanies the right gastro-epiploic artery along the greater cur- vature of the stomach, and anastomoses with branches from the splenic plexus. A cystic plexus, which supplies the gall-bladder, also arises from the hepatic plexus,, near the liver. The splenic plex^is is formed by branches from the coeliac plexus, the left semi- lunar ganglia, and from the right pneumogastric nerve. It accompanies the splenic artery and its branches to the substance of the spleen, giving off, in its course, filaments to the pancreas {pancreatic plexus), and the left gastro-epiploic plexusy which accompanies the gastro-epiploica sinistra artery along the convex border of the stomach. 3 G 2SYMPATHETIC XERYE 820 The superior mesenteric plexus is a continuation of the lower part of the great solar plexus, receiving a branch from the junction of the right pneumogastric nerve with thP pf^liac nlexus.

The nerves composing this plexus are white in colour and firm in texture, and have numerous ganglia developed upon them near their origin. The aortic plexus is formed by branches derived, on each side, from the solar plexus and the semilunar ganglia, receiving filaments from some of the lumbar ganglia. It is situated upon the sides and front of the aorta, between the origins of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. From this plexus arise part of the spermatic, the inferior mesenteric, and the hypogastric plexuses; and it distributes filaments to the inferior vena cava. The inferior mesenteric plexus is derived chiefly from the left side of the aortic plexus. It surrounds the inferior mesenteric artery, and divides into a number of secondary plexuses, which are distributed to all the parts supplied by the artery, viz. the left colic and sigmoid plexuses, which supply the descending and sigmoid flexure of the colon: and the superior haemorrhoidal plexus, which supplies the upper part of the rectum, and joins in the pelvis with branches from the pelvic plexus. Hypogasteic Plexus The Hypogastric Plexus supplies the viscera of the pelvic cavity. It is situated in front of the promontory of the sacrum, between the two common iliac arteries, and is formed by the union of numerous filaments, which descend on each side from the aortic plexus, and from the lumbar ganglia. This plexus contains no ganglia ; and bifurcates, below, into two lateral portions, which form the 'pelvic plexuses. Pelvic Plexus The Pelvic Plexus (sometimes called inferior hypogastric) supplies the viscera of the pelvic cavity, is situated at the side of the rectum and bladder in the male, and at the side of the rectum, vagina, and bladder in the female. It is formed by a continuation of the hypogastric plexus, by branches from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, and by a few filaments from the first two sacral ganglia. At the point of junction of these nerves, small ganglia are found. From this plexus numerous branches are distributed to all the viscera of the pelvis. They accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery. The inferior haemorrhoidal plexus arises from the back part of the pelvic plexus. It supplies the rectum, joining with branches of the superior haemor- rhoidal plexus. The vesical plexus arises from the fore part of the pelvic plexus. The nerves composing it are numerous, and contain a large proportion of spinal nerve-fibres. They accompany the vesical arteries, and are distributed at the side and base of the bladder. Numerous filaments also pass to the vesiculae seminales and vas deferens ; those accompanying the vas deferens join, on the spermatic cord, with branches from the spermatic plexus. The prostatic plexus is continued from the lower part of the pelvic plexus. The nerves composing it are of large size. They are distributed to the pro- state gland, vesicul^ seminales, and erectile structure of the penis. The nerves supplying the erectile structure of the penis consist of two sets, the small and large cavernous nerves. They are slender filaments, which arise from the fore part of the prostatic plexus, and, after joining with branches from the internal pudic nerve, pass forwards beneath the pubic arch. The small cavernous nerves perforate the fibrous covering of the penis, near its roots. The large cavernous nerve passes forwards along the dorsum of the penis,SYMPATHETIC NEKVE 822 joins with the dorsal branch of the loudic nerve, and is distributed to the corpus cavernosum and spongiosum. The vaginal plexus arises from the lower part of the pelvic plexus. It is lost on the walls of the vagina, being distributed to the erectile tissue at its anterior part and to the mucous membrane. The nerves composing this plexus contain, like the vesical, a large proportion of spinal nerve-fibres. The uterine plexus arises from the upper part of the pelvic plexus, above the point where the branches from the sacral nerves join the plexus. Its branches accompany the uterine arteries to the side of the organ between the layers of the broad ligament, and are distributed to the cervix and lower part of the body of the uterus, penetrating its substance. Other filaments pass separately to the body of the uterus and Fallopian tube. Branches from the plexus accompany the uterine arteries into the substance of the uterus. Upon these filaments ganglionic enlargements are found.OEGANS OF SENSE THE Organs of the Senses are five in number : viz. those of Touch, of Taste, of Smell, of Hearing, and of Sight. The skin, which is the principal seat of the sense of touch, has been described in the chapter on General Anatomy. THE TONGUE The Tongue is the organ of the special sense of taste. It is situated in the floor of the mouth, in the interval between the two lateral portions of the body of the lower jaw. Its base, or root, is directed backwards, and connected with the os hyoides by the Hyo-glossi and Genio-hyo-glossi muscles and the hyo-giossal membrane ; with Fig. 476.—Upper surface of the tongue. the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane, which form the glosso-epiglottic, ligaments ; with the soft palate by means of the anterior pillars of the fauces and with the pharynx by the Superior constrictor and the mucous membrane. Its apex, or tip, thin and narrow, is directed forwards against the inner surface of the lower incisor teeth. The under surface of the tongue is connected with the lower jaw by the Genio-hyo-glossi muscles; from its sides, the mucous membrane is reflected to the inner surface of the gums ; and, in front, a distinct fold of that membrane, the frcBnum lingucB, is formed beneath its under surface. The tip of the tongue, part of the under surf ace, its sides, and dorsum, are fr ee. The dorsum of the tongue is convex, marked along the middle line by a raphe.824 ORGANS OF SENSE which divides it into symmetrical halves ; this raphe terminates behind, about an inch from the base of the organ, in a depression, the foramen ccEcum. The anterior two-thirds of this sm^face are rough and covered, with papillae; the posterior third is smoother, and covered by the projecting orifices of numerous muciparous glands. Structure of the Tongue.—The tongue is partly invested by mucous membrane and a submucous fibrous layer. It consists of symmetrical halves, separated from each other, in the middle line, by a fibrous septum. Each half is composed of muscular fibres arranged in various directions, containing much interposed fat, and supplied by vessels and nerves. The mucous membrane invests the entire extent of the free surface of the tongue. On the dorsum it is thicker behind than in front, and is continuous with the sheaths of the muscles attached to it, through the submucous fibrous layer. On the under surface of the organ it can be traced on each side of the fragnum, through the ducts of the submaxillary and the sublingual glands. As it passes over the borders of the organ, it gradually assumes its papillary character. The structure of the mucous membrane of the tongue differs in different parts. That covering the under surface of the organ is thin, smooth, and identical in structure with that lining the rest of the oral cavity. The mucous membrane on the anterior part of the dorsum of the tongue is thin and intimately adherent to the muscular tissue, whilst that at the root is much thicker and looser. It consists of a layer of connective tissue, the corium or mucosa, supporting numerous ijainllcB, and covered, as well as the papillae, with epithelium. The epithehum is of the scaly variety, like that of the epidermis. ^ It covers the free surface of the tongue, as may be easily demonstrated by maceration or boiling, when it can be easily detached entire : it is much thinner than on the skin : the intervals between the large papilla are not filled up by it, but each papilla has a separate investment from root to summit. The deepest cells may sometimes be detached as a separate layer, corresponding to the rete mucosum, but they never contain colouring matter. The corium consists of a dense felt-work of fibrous connective tissue, with numerous elastic fibres, firmly connected with the fibrous tissue forming the septa between the muscular bundles of the tongue. It contains the ramifications of the numerous vessels and nerves from which the papilla? are supplied, large plexuses of lymphatic vessels, and the glands of the tongue. The i)a2)ill(B of the tongtie.—These are papillary projections of the corium. They are thickly distributed over the anterior two-thirds of its upper surface, giving to it its characteristic roughness. The varieties of papilla? met with are, the papillae maxim^e {circwnvallatcB), papillae mediae (fungiformes), papillae minimae [conicce or filiformes), and papillje simplices. The iMirillcB maximce (circumvallatae) are of large size, and vary from eight to twelve in number. They are situated at the back part of the dorsum of the tongue, near its base, forming a row on each side, which, running backwards and inwards.THE TONGUE meet in the middle line, like the two lines of the letter V inverted. Each papilla consists of a projection of mucous membrane from ^ to wide, attached to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression of the mucous membrane ; the papilla is in shape like a truncated cone ; the smaller end being directed downwards and attached to the tongue, the broader part or base projecting on the surface and being studded with numerous small secondary papillae, which, however, are covered by a smooth layer of the epithelium. The cup-shaped depression forms a kind of fossa round the papilla, having a circular margin of about the same elevation, covered with smaller papillae. At the point of junction of the tw^o rows of pai^illae is the deep depression, the foramen ccRcum, mentioned above. The papiUcB medim (fungiformes), more numerous than the preceding, are scattered irregularly and sparingly over the dorsum of the tongue ; but are found chiefly at its sides and apex. They are easily recognised, among the other papillae, by their large size, rounded eminences, and deep red colour. They are narrow at their attachment to the tongue, but broad and rounded at their free extremities, and covered with secondary papilla. Their epithelial investment is very thin. The ijapilke minimcd (conicae or filiformes) cover the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum of the tongue. They are very minute, more or less conical or filiform in shape, and arranged in lines correspond- ing in direction with the two rows of the papillae circumvallatae ; excepting at the apex of the organ, where their direction is transverse. They have projecting from their apices numerous filiform processes, or secondary papillae, which are of a whitish tint, owing to the thickness and density of the epithelium of which they are composed, and which has here undergone a peculiar modification, the cells having become cornified and elongated into dense, im- bricated, brush-like processes. They con- tain also a number of elastic fibres, which render them firmer and more elastic than the papillae of mucous membrane generally. Simi^le iKiiyillce, similar to those of the skin, cover the whole of the mucous membrane of the tongue, as well as the larger papilla. They consist of closely set, microscopic elevations of the corium, containing a capillary loop, covered by a layer of epithelium. Structure of the papillcE.—The papillae apparently resemble in structure those of the cutis, consisting of a cone-shaped projection of connective tissue, covered with a thick layer of squamous epithelium, and contain one or more capillary loops, amongst which nerves are distributed in great abundance. If the epithelium is removed, it will be found that they are not simple elevations like the papillae of the skin, for the surface of each is studded with minute conical processes of the mucous membrane, which form secondary papillae (Todd and Bowman). In the papillse circumvallatae, the nerves are numerous and of large size; in the papillae fungi- formes, they are also numerous, and terminate in a plexiform network, from which brushlike branches proceed ; in the papillae filiformes, their mode of termi- nation is uncertain. Buried in the epidermis of the papilla circumvallatae, and in some of the fungiformes, certain peculiar bodies called taste-goblets have been described.* They are flask-like in shape, their broad base resting on the corium, * These bodies are also found in considerable numbers at the side of the base of the tongue, just in front of the anterior pillars of the fauces.

They are formed by two kinds of cells : the external (cortical) are arranged in several layers ; they are long and flattened, with tapering ends, and in contact by their edges; the tapering extremities extending from the base to the apex of the organ. They thus enclose the central cells (gustatory cells), which are spindle-shaped, and have a large spherical nucleus about the middle of the cell. Both extremities are filamentous, the inner process is described as continuous with the terminal fibril of a nerve, while the outer one projects as an extremely fine hair through the orifice of the taste-gobiet.* Glands of the tongue.—The tongue is provided with mucous and serous glands and lymphoid follicles. The mucous glands are similar in structure to the labial and buccal glands. They are found all over the surface of the mucous membrane of the tongue, especially at the back part behind the circumvallate papillae, but also at the apex and marginal parts. In connection with these glands, a special one has been described by Blandin and Nuhn. It is situated near the apex of the tongue on either side of the fraenum, and is covered over by a fasciculus of muscular fibre derived from the Stylo-giossus and Inferior lingualis. It is from half an inch to nearly an inch long, and about the third of an inch broad. It has from four to six ducts, which open on the under surface of the apex. The serous glands occur only at the back of the tongue in the neighbourhood of the taste-goblets, their ducts opening for the most part into the fossae of the circumvallate papillae. These glands are racemose, the duct branching into several minute ducts, which terminate in alveoli, lined by a single layer of more or less Fig. 480.-—Under surface of tongue, showing position and relations of gland of Blandin and Nnhn.

Their secretion is of a watery nature, and probably assists in the distribution of the substance to be tasted over the taste area. (Ebner.) Tlfie lymphoid follicles.—The lymphoid tissue is situated, for the most part, at the back of the tongue, between the epiglottis and the circumvallate papillae, and is collected at numerous points into distinct masses known as lympthoid follicles. Here and there in this situation are depressions in the mucous membrane, * See Engelmann, in Strieker's Handbook {New Syd. Soc. Trans.), vol. iii. p. 2. jTHE TONGUE 827 surrounded, by nodules of lymphoid tissue, similar to the structure found in the tonsil: into them open some of the ducts of the mucous glands. The fibrous septum consists of a vertical layer of fibrous tissue, extending throughout the entire length of the middle line of the tongue, from the base to the apex, though not quite reaching the dorsum. It is thicker behind than in front, and occasionally contains a small fibro-cartilage, about a quarter of an inch in length. It is well displayed by making a vertical section across the organ. The Hyo-glossal membrane is a strong fibrous lamina, which connects the under surface of the base of the tongue to the body of the hyoid bone. This membrane receives, in front, some of the fibres of the Genio-hyo-glossi. Vessels of the tongue.—The arteries of the tongue are derived from the lingual. Fig. 481.—Under surface of tongue, showing the distribution of nerves to this organ. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) the fascial, and ascending pharyngeal. The veins of the tongue accompany the arteries. Muscles of the tongue.—The muscular fibres of the tongue run in various directions. These fibres are divided into two sets, Extrinsic and Intrinsic. The 'Extrinsic muscles of the tongue are those which have their origin external to it, and only their terminal fibres contained in the substance of the organ. They are the Stylo-glossus, the Hyo-glossus, the Palato-glossus, the Genio-hyo-glossus, and part of the Superior constrictor of the pharynx (Pharyngo-glossus). The Intrinsic muscles are those which are contained entirely within the tongue, and form the greater part of its substance. Both sets have been already described (page 391). The lymphatic vessels from the tongue pass to one or two small glands situated828 ORGAXS OF SENSE on the Hvo-glossns muscle iu the submaxillary region, and from thence to the deep glands of the neck. The nerves of the tongue are four in number in each half : the lingual branch of the fifth, which is distributed to the papillae at the fore part and sides of the tongue; the lingual branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which is distributed to the mucous membrane at the base and side of the tongue, and to the papillae circum- vallat^e ; the hypoglossal nerve, which is distributed to the muscular substance of the tongue ; and the chorda tympani to the Lmgualis muscle. Sympathetic filaments also pass to the tongue from the nervi molles on the lingual and other arteries supplying it. The glosso-pharyngeal branch is the special nerve of the sense of taste; the lingual (gustatory) is the nerve of common sensation ; and the hypoglossal is the motor nerve of the tongue, except for the Inferior lingualis which is supplied by the chorda tpnpani. Surgical Anatomy.—The diseases to which the tongue is hable are numerous, aud its sm^gieal anatomy of importance, since any or all the structiu'es of which it is composed— muscles, connective tissue, mucous membrane, glands, vessels, nerves, and h-mphatics—may be the seat of morbid changes. It is not often the seat of congenital defects, though a few cases of vertical cleft have been recorded, and it is occasionally, though much more rarely than is commonly supposed, the seat of ' tongue tie,' h'om shortness of the h'iemun (see page 534). There is, however, one condition, which must be regarded as congenital, though it does not sometimes evidence itseK imtil a year or two after birth, which is not imcommon. This is an enlargement of the tongue which is due primarily to a dilatation of the lymph- channels and a gi'eatly increased development of the lymphatic tissue tln'oughout the tongue. This is often aggravated by inflammatory changes induced by injmwor exposm^e. and the tons^ie may assmne enormous dimensions and hang out of the mouth, givmg the child an unbecile exj)ression. The treatment consists in excisinof a Y-shaped portion and bringing the cut surfaces together with deeply placed silver sutm-es. Compression has been resorted to in some cases and with success, but it is dithcult to apply. Acute uitiamma- tion of the tongue, which may be caused by iujmw and the introduction of some septic or hritating matter, is attended by great swelluig fi-om infiltration of its connective tissue, which is in considerable quantity. This renders the patient incapable of swaUo-uing or speaking, and may seriously impede resphation. It may run on to suppm-ation. and the formation of an acute abscess. Chi^onic abscess, which has been mistaken for cancer, may also occm' in the substance of the tongue. The mucous membrane of the tongue may become chi'onically inflamed, and presents different appearances in different stages of the disease, to which the terms leucoplakia, psoriasis, and ichthyosis have been given. The tongue, being very vascular, is often the seat of n-aevoid growths, and these have a tendency to grow rapidly. The tongue is fi-equently the seat of ulceration, which may arise fi'om many causes, as fi'om the mitation of jagged teeih, dyspepsia, tubercle, syphilis, and cancer. Of these the cancerous ulcer is the most important and probably also the most common. The varietj* is the squamous epithelioma, which soon develops into an ulcer with an indurated base. It produces great pain, which speedily extends to ah jDarts supplied with sensation by the fifth nerve, especially to the region of the ear. The pain in these cases is conducted to the ear and temporal region by the lingual nerve, and fiom it to the other branches of the inferior maxillary nerve, especially the am'iculo-temporal. Possibly pain in the ear itself may be due to implication of the fibres of the glosso-j)haryno:eal nerve, which by its tympanic branch is conducted to the tympanic plexus. Cancer of the tongue may necessitate removal of a part or the whole of the organ, and many different methods have been adoj)ted for its excision. It may be removed fi'om the mouth b}- the ecrasem- or the scissors. Probably the better method is by the scissors, usually kno^-n as "Whitehead's method. The mouth is widely opened with a gag; the tongue transfixed with a stout sillv ligature, by which to hold and make traction on it, and the reflexion of mucous membrane fi'om the tongue to the jaw, and the insertion of the Genio-hyo-glossus first divided with a pah of curved, blimt scissors. The Palato-glossus is also divided. The tongue can now be pulled well out of the mouth. The base of the tongue is cut through by a series of short snips, each bleeding vessel being dealt with as soon as divided, imtil the situation of the ranine artery is reached. The remaining undivided portion of tissue is to be seized with a pair of Wells' forceps; the tongue removed, and the vessel secm^ed. In the event of the ranine arteiw being accidentally mjmed, haemorrhage can be at once controlled, by passing two fingers over the dorsum of the tongue as far as the epiglottis, and dragghig the root of the tongue forcibly forwards. In cases where the disease is confined to one side of the tongue, this operation may be modified by splitting the tongue down the centre and removing only the affected half. In cases where the submaxihaiw glands are involved, Kocher's operation should be performed.THE NOSE He removes the tongue from the neck, having performed a preliminary tracheotoni}-, by an incision from near the lobide of the ear, down the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid to the level of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, then forwards to the body of the hyoid bone, and upwards to near the symphysis of the jaw. The lingual artery is now secm^ed, and by a careful dissection the submaxillary lymphatic glands and the tongue removed. Eegnoli advocated the removal of the tongue by a semilunar incision in the submaxillary triangle, along the line of the lower jaw, and a vertical incision from the centre of the semilunar one backwards to the hyoid bone. Care must be taken not to carry the first incision too far backwards, so as to wound the facial arteries. The tongue is thus reached through the floor of the mouth, pulled out through the external incision, and removed with the ecraseur or knife. The great objection to this operation is that all the muscles which raise the hyoid bone and larynx are divided, and that therefore the movements of deglutition and respiration are interfered with. Finally, where both sides of the floor of the mouth are involved in the disease, or where very free access is required on account of the extension backwards of the disease to the pillars of the fauces and the tonsil, or where the lower jaw is involved, the operation recommended by Syme must be performed. This is done by an incision through the central line of the lip, across the chin, and down as far as the hyoid bone. The lower jaw is sawn through at the symphysis, and the two halves of tlje bone forcildy separated from each other. The mucous membrane is separated from the bone, and the Genio- hyo-glossi detached from the bone, and the Hyo-glossi divided. The tongue is then drawn forwards, and removed close to its attachment to the hyoid bone. Any glands which are enlarged can be removed, and if the bone is implicated m the disease, it can also be removed by freeing it from the soft parts externally and internally, and making a second section with the saw bej^ond the diseased part. Formerly many sm^geons before removing the tongue performed a preliminary tracheotomy: (i) to prevent blood entering the air passages; and (2) to allow the patient to breathe tln-ough the tube and not inspire air which had passed over a sloughy wound, and which was loaded with septic organisms and likely to induce septic ]ineumonia. By the judicious use of iodoform, this secondary evil may be obviated, and lae preliminary tracheotomy is now usually dispensed with. THE NOSE The nose is the special organ of the sense of smell: by means of the peculiar properties of its nerves, it protects the lungs from the inhalation of deleterious gases, and assists the organ of taste in discriminating the properties of food. Figs. 482, 483.—Cartilages of the nose. The organ of smell consists of two parts : one external, the nose; the other internal, the nasal fosses. The nose is the more anterior and prominent part of the organ of smell. It is of a triangular form, directed vertically downwards, and projects from the centre of the face, immediately above the upper lip. Its summit, or root, is connected830 ORGANS OF SENSE directly with the forehead. Its inferior part, the base of the nose, presents two eUiptical orifices, the nostrils, separated from each other by an antero-posterior septum, the coliimna. The margins of these orifices are provided with a number of stiff hairs, or vihrissce, which arrest the passage of foreign substances carried with the current of air intended for respiration. The lateral surfaces of the nose form, by their union, the dorsum, the direction of which varies considerably in different individuals. The dorsum terminates below in a rounded eminence, the lobe of the nose. The nose is composed of a framework of bones and cartilages, the latter being slightly acted upon by certain muscles. It is covered externally by the integument, internally by mucous membrane, and supplied with vessels and nerves. The bony frajneivork occupies the upper part of the organ : it consists of the nasal bones, and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary. The cartilaginous frameioorh consists of five pieces, the two upper and the two lower lateral cartilages, and the cartilage of the septum. The upper lateral cartilages'sue situated below the free margin of the nasal bones ; each cartilage is flattened, and triangular in shape. Its anterior margin is thicker than the posterior, and connected with the fibro-cartilage of the septum. Its posterior margin is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxillary and nasal bones. Its inferior margin is connected by fibrous tissue with the lower lateral cartilage : one surface is turned outwards, the other inwards towards the nasal cavity. The loiver lateral cartilages are two thin, flexible plates, situated immediately below the preceding, and bent upon themselves in such a manner as to form the inner and outer walls of each orifice of the nostril. The portion which forms the inner wall, thicker than the rest, is Fig. 484.—Bones and cartilages of septum of loosely connected with the same nose. Eight side. part of the opposite cartilage, and forms a small part of the columna. Its inferior border, free, rounded, and projecting, forms, with the thickened integument and sub- jacent tissue, and the corresponding parts of the opposite side, the tip of the nose. The part which forms the outer wall is curved to cor- respond with the ala of the nose ; it is oval and flattened, narrow be- hind, where it is connected with the nasal process of the superior maxilla by a tough fibrous membrane, in which are found three or four small cartilaginous plates (sesamoid carti- lages), cartilagines minores. Above, it is connected to the upper lateral cartilage and front part of the cartilage of the septum ; below, it is separated from the margin of the nostril by dense cellular tissue ; and in front, it forms, with its fellow, the lobe of the nose. The cartilage of the septum is somewhat quadrilateral in form, thicker at its margins than at its centre, and completes the separation between the nasal fossae in front. Its anterior margin, thickest above, is connected from above downwards with the nasal bones, the anterior margin of the two upper lateral cartilages, and the inner portion of the two lower lateral cartilages. Its posterior margin is connected with the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid ; its inferior margin with the vomer and the palate processes of the superior maxillary bones. These various cartilages are connected to each other, and to the bones, by a tough fibrous membrane, which allows the utmost facility of movement between them. The muscles of the nose are situated immediately beneath the integument:THE NASAL FOSS^ 831 they are (on each side) the Pyramidahs nasi, the Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, the Dilatator naris, anterior and posterior, the Compressor nasi, the Com- pressor narimn minor, and the Depressor alse nasi. They have been described above (page 375). The mtegument covering the dorsum and sides of the nose is thin, and loosely connected with the subjacent parts ; but where it forms the tip, or lobe, and the alae of the nose, it is thicker and more firmly adherent. It is furnished with a large number of sebaceous follicles, the orifices of which are usually very distinct. The mucous memhrane, lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with that which lines the nasal fossee within. The arteries of the nose are the lateralis nasi from the facial, and the inferior artery of the septum from the superior coronary, which supply the aim and septum; the sides and dorsum being supplied from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic and the infra-orbital. The veins of the nose terminate in the facial and ophthalmic. The nerves of the nose are branches from the facial, infra-orbital, and infra- trochlear, and a, filament from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. Nasal Fossae The nasal fossae are two irregular cavities situated in the middle of the face, and extending from before backwards. They open in front by the two anterior Fig. 485,—Transverse vertical section of the nasal fossae. (Henle.) sinus hone hone nares, and terminate in the pharynx, behind, by the posterior nares. The anterior nares are somewhat pear-shaped apertures, each measuring about one inch vertically and half an inch transversely at their widest part. The posterior nares are two oval openings, situated at the upper part of the anterior wall of the pharynx. They are smaller in the body than in the skeleton, because narrowed by the mucous membrane. Each opening measures an inch in the vertical, and half an inch in the transverse direction in a well-developed adult skull. The mucous membrane lining the nasal fossge is called the ])ituitary, from the nature of its secretion; or Schneiderian, from Schneider, the first anatomist whoORGANS OF SENSE showed that the secretion proceeded from the mucous membrane, and not, as was formerly hnagined, from the brain. It is intimately adherent to the periosteum or perichondrium, over which it lies. It is continuous externally with the skin through the anterior nares, and with the mucous membrane of the pharynx through the posterior nares. From the nasal fossae its continuity may be traced with the conjunctiva, through the nasal duct and lachrymal canals; with the lining membrane of the tympanum and mastoid cells, through the Eustachian tube; and with the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses, and the antrum of Highmore, through the several openings in the meatuses. The mucous membrane is thickest, and most vascular, over the turbinated bones. It is also thick over the septum; but, in the intervals between the spongy bones, and on the floor of the nasal fossae, it is very thin. Where it lines the various sinuses and the antrum of Highmore, it is thin and pale. Owing to the great thickness of this membrane, the nasal fossae are much narrower, and the turbinated bones, especially the lower ones, appear larger and more prominent than in the skeleton. From the same circumstance, also, the various apertures communicating with the meatuses are either' narrowed or completely closed. In the stqjerior meatus, the aperture of communication with the posterior ethmoidal cells is considerably diminished in size, and the spheno-palatine foramen completely covered in. In the middle meatus, the opening of the infundibulum is partially hidden by a projecting fold of mucous membrane, and the orifice of the antrum is contracted to a small circular aperture, much narrower than in the skeleton. In the inferior meatus, the orifice of the nasal duct is partially hidden by either a single or double valvular mucous fold, and the anterior palatine canal either completely closed in, or a tubular cul-de-sac of mucous membrane is continued a short distance into it. This cul-de-sac is termed the organ of Jacobson, and is present in all mammals as well as man. In the former it consists of a bilateral tube, situated in the nasal septum and supported by hyaline cartilage, the cartilage of Jacobson. In the roof, the opening leading to the sphenoidal sinus is narrowed, and the apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid completely closed in. Structure of the mucous membrane.—The epithelium covering the mucous membrane differs in its character according to the functions of the part of the nose in which it is found. Near the orifice of the nostril, the vestibule, where common sensation is chiefly or alone required, the epithelium is of the ordinary pavement or scaly variety. In the rest of the cavity, below the distribution of the olfactory nerves, i.e. in the respiratory portion of the nasal cavity, the epithelium is columnar and ciliated. This is the case also in the meatuses of the nose. In this region, beneath the epithelium and its basement membrane, is a fibrous layer infiltrated with lymph-corpuscles, so as to form in many parts a difiuse adenoid tissue, and beneath this a nearly continuous layer of smaller and larger glands, some mucous and some serous, the ducts of which open upon the surface. In the olfactory region, i.e. the region in which thje terminal filaments from the olfactory nerves are distributed (see page 735), the epithelial cells are columnar and, for the most part, non-ciliated: their free surface presents a sharp outline, and their deep extremity is prolonged into a process which runs inwards, branching to commu- nicate with similar processes from neighbouring cells, so as to form a network in the deep part of the mucous membrane. Lying between them are cells (termed by Max Schultze, oZ/«ctor^ ce/Zs), which consist of a nucleated body and two processes, of which one runs outwards between the columnar epithelial cells, and projects on the surface of the mucous membrane; the other (the deep) process runs inwards, is frequently beaded like a nerve-fibre, and is believed by most observers to be in connection with one of the terminal filaments of the olfactory nerve. Amongst the branched ends of the columnar cells there is a deep layer of epithelial cells, of a conical shape, their broad end resting on the basement membrane, and their833 THE NASAL FOSS^ tapering extremity projecting between the other cells. Beneath the epithelium, extending through the thickness of the mucous membrane, is a layer of glands, the glands of Bowman, identical in structure with serous glands. The mucous membrane is pigmented in the olfactory, but not in the other regions, being of a light yellow colour, at least in the white races.* The arteries of the nasal fossce are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal, from the ophthalmic, which supply the ethmoidal cells, frontal sinuses, and roof of the nose; a minute twig from the small meningeal; the spheno-palatine, from the internal maxillary, which supplies the mucous membrane covering the spongy bones, the meatuses and septum ; the inferior artery of the septum from the superior coronary of the facial; and the alveolar branch of the internal maxillary, which supplies the lining membrane of the antrum. The ramifications of these vessels form a close, plexiform network, beneath and in the substance of the mucous membrane. The veins of the nasal fossce form a close network beneath the mucous membrane. They pass, some with the veins accompanying the spheno-palatine artery, through the spheno-palatine foramen ; and others, through the alveolar br^inch, to join the facial vein ; some accom- pany the ethmoidal arteries, and terminate in the ophthalmic vein ; and, lastly, a few communicate with the veins in the interior of the skull, through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and the foramen caecum. The nerves are : the olfactory, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, filaments from the anterior dental branch of the superior maxillary, the Vidian, naso-palatine, descending anterior palatine, and nasal branches of Meckel's ganglion. The olfactory, the special nerve of the sense of smell, is distributed over the upper third of the septum, and over the surface of the superior and middle spongy bones. The nasal branch of the oijhthahnic distributes filaments to the fore part of the septum, and outer wall of the nasal fossas. Filaments from the anterior dental branch of the siqjerior maxillary supply the inferior meatus and inferior turbinated bone. The Vidian nerve supplies the upper and back part of the septum, and superior spongy bone ; and the upper anterior nasal branches from the spheno-palatine ganglion have a similar distribution. The naso-palatine nerve supplies the middle of the septum. The larger, or anterior palatine nerve supplies the middle and lower spongy bones. Surgical Anatomy.—Instances of congenital deformity of the nose are occasionally met with, such as complete absence of the nose, an aperture only being present; or perfect development on one side, and suppression or malformation on the other ; or there maybe imperfect apposition of the nasal bones, so that the nose presents a median cleft or furrow. Deformities which have been acquired are much more common, such as flattening of the nose, the result of syphilitic necrosis ; or imperfect development of the nasal bones in cases of congenital syphilis ; or a lateral deviation of the nose may result from fracture. The skin over the alae and tip of the nose is thick and closely adherent to subjacent * An interesting speculation has been suggested by Dr. W. Ogle (Med.-Chir. Trans., vol. liii. p. 277) as to the possible connection between the presence and abundance of this pigment and the perfection of the sense of smell. 3H Fig. 486.—Nerves of septum of nose. Eight side.834 ORGANS OF SENSE part s. Inflammation of this part is therefore very painful, on account of the tension. It is largely supplied with blood, and, the circulation here being terminal, vascular engorgement is liable to occur, esi^ecially in women at the menopause, and in both sexes fi^om disorders of digestion, exposure to cold, etc. The skin of the nose also contains a large number of sebaceous follicles, and these, as the result of intemperance, are apt to become affected and the nose reddened, congested, and irregularly swollen. To this the term ' grog-blossom ' is popularly applied. In some of these cases there is enormous hypertrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, producing pendulous masses, termed lipomata nasi. Epithelioma and rodent ulcer may attack the nose, the latter being the more common of the two. Lupus and syphilitic ulceration frequently attack the nose, and may destroy the whole of the cartilaginous portion. In fact, lupus vulgaris begins more frequently on the ala of the nose than in any other situation. Cases of congenital occlusion of one or both nostrils, or adhesion between the ala and septum, may occur and may require immediate operation, since the obstruction much interferes with sucking. Bony closure of the posterior nares may also occur. To examine the nasal cavities, the head should be thrown back and the nose drawn upwards, the parts being dilated by some form of speculum. It can also be examined with the little finger or a probe, and in this way foreign bodies detected. A still more extensive examination can be made by Eouge's operation, which was introduced for the cure of ozcena, by the removal of any dead bone which may be present in this disease. The whole framework of the nose is lifted up by an incision made inside the mouth, through the junction of the upper lip Avith the bone; the septum nasi and the lateral cartilages are divided with strong scissors till the anterior nares are completely exposed. The posterior nares can be explored by reflected light from the mouth, by which the posterior nares can be illuminated. The examination is very difficult to carry out, and, as a rule, sufficient information regarding the presence of foreign bodies or tumours in the naso-pharynx can be obtained by the introduction of the finger behind the soft palate through the mouth. The septum of the nose may Be displaced or deviate from the middle line : this may be the result of an injury or from some congenital defect in its development. Sometimes the deviation may be so great that the septum may come in contact with the outer wall of the nasal fossEe, and may even become adherent to it, thus producing complete obstruction. Perforation of the septum is not an uncommon affection, and may arise from several causes: syphilitic or tubercular ulceration, blood tumour or abscess of the septum, and especially in workmen exposed to the vapour of bichromate of potash, from the irritating and corrosive action of the fumes. When small, the perforation may cause a peculiar whistling sound during respiration. When large, it may lead to the falling in of the bridge of the nose. Epistaxis is a very common affection in children. It is rarely of much consequence, and will almost always subside, but in the more violent haemorrhages of later life it may be necessary to plug the ]30sterior nares. In performing this operation it is desirable to remember the size of the posterior nares. A ready method of regulating the size of the plug to fit the opening is to make it of the same size as the terminal phalanx of the thumb of the patient to be operated on. Nasal polypus is a very common disease, and presents itself in three forms : the gelatinous, the fibrous, and the malignant. The first is by far the most common. It grows from the mucous membrane of the outer wall of the nasal fossa, where there is an abundant layer of highly vascular submucous tissue; rarely from the septum, where the mucous membrane is closely adherent to the cartilage and bone, without the inter- vention of much, if any, submucous tissue. Their most common seat is probablj^ the middle turbinated bone. The fibrous polypus generally grows from the base of the skull behind the posterior nares, or from the roof of the nasal fossae. The malignant polypi, both sarcomatous or carcinomatous, may arise in the nasal cavities" and the naso- pharynx ; or they may originate in the antrum, and protrude through its inner wall into the nasal fossa. Rhinoliths, or nose-stones, may sometimes be found in the nasal cavities, from the for- mation of phosphate of lime, upon either a foreign body or a piece of inspissated secretion. THE EYE The eyeball is contained in the cavity of the orbit. In this situation it is securely protected from injury, whilst its position is such as to ensure the most extensive range of sight. It is acted upon by numerous muscles, by which it is capable of being directed to any part; it is supplied by vessels and nerves, and is additionally protected in front by several appendages, such as the eyebrow, eye- lids, etc. The eyeball is embedded in the fat of the orbit, but is surrounded by a thin membranous sac, the capsule of Tenon, which isolates it, so as to allow of free movement.THE EYE 835 The capsule of Tenon {tunica vaginalis ocidi) may be regarded as a distinct serous membrane, consisting of a parietal and visceral layer. The latter invests the posterior part of the globe from the ciliary margin of the cornea backwards to the entrance of the optic nerve, and is connected to it by very delicate connective tissue ; the former (parietal) lines the hollow in the fat in which the eyeball is embedded. Both layers are lined on their free surfaces by endothelial cells. The cavity between them is continuous with the spaces between the different layers of the sheath of the optic nerve—-that is to say, with the subarachnoidean between the pia-niatral and the arachnoid sheath, and the suhdural between the arachnoid and dural sheath—and into it empty the lymphatic vessels of the sclerotic. The capsule is pierced by the muscles of the eyeball near their insertion, and sends tubular prolongations on them, which become continuous with the sheath of the muscles. From the outer surface of these sheaths, expansions, consisting of elastic fibres and muscle-cells, are given off to the margin of the orbit, which serve to limit the degree of contraction of the muscles.* The eyeball is composed of segments of two spheres of different sizes. The anterior segment is one of a small sphere, and forms about one-sixth of the eyeball. It is more prominent than the posterior segment, which is one of a much larger sphere, and forms about five-sixths of the globe. The segment of the larger sphere is opaque, and formed by the sclerotic, the tunic of protection to the eyeball; the smaller sphere is transparent, and formed by the cornea. The axes of the eyeballs are nearly parallel, and do not correspond to the axes of the orbits, which are directed outwards. The optic nerves follow the direction of the axes of the orbits and are therefore not parallel; they enter the eyeball a little to their inner or nasal side. The eyeball measures rather more in its transverse than in its antero- posterior and vertical diameters, the former amounting to about an inch, the latter to about nine-tenths of an inch. The eyeball is composed of several investing tunics, and of fluid and solid refracting media, called humours. The tunics are three in number : — 1. Sclerotic and Cornea. 2. Choroid, Iris, and Ciliary Processes. 3. Retina. The refracting media, or humours, are also three :— Aqueous. Crystalline (lens) and Capsule. Vitreous. The sclerotic and cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball; they are essentially fibrous in structure, the sclerotic being opaque, and forming the posterior five-sixths of the globe ; the cornea, which forms the remaining sixth, being transparent. The Sclerotic (o-KXrjpo^;, hard) (fig. 487) has received its name from its extreme density and hardness ; it is a firm, unyielding, fibrous membrane, serving to main- tain the form of the globe. It is much thicker behind than in front. Its external surface is of a white colour, quite smooth, except at the points where the Recti and Obliqui muscles are inserted into it, and covered, for part of its extent, by the conjunctival membrane ; hence the whiteness and brilliancy of the front of the eyeball. Its inner surface is stained of a brown colour, marked by grooves, in which are lodged the ciliary nerves, and connected by an exceedingly fine cellular tissue (lamina fusca) with the outer surface of the choroid. Behind, it is pierced by the optic nerve a little to its inner or nasal side, and is continuous with the fibrous sheath of the nerve, which is derived from the dura mater. At the point where the optic nerve passes through the sclerotic, this membrane forms a thin cribriform lamina (the lamina crihrosa) ; the minute orifices in this layer serve for the transmission of. the nervous filaments, and the fibrous septa dividing them * See a paper by Mr. C. B. Lockwood, Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xx. part i. p. I. 3 H 2836 OEGANS OF SENSE from one another are continuous with the membranous processes which separate the bundles of nerve-fibres. One of these openings, larger than the rest, occupies the centre of the lamella; it is called the j^oriis opticus, and transmits the arteria centralis retinae to the interior of the eyeball. Around the cribriform lamella are numerous small apertures for the transmission of the ciliary vessels and nerves. In front, the sclerotic is continuous with the cornea by direct continuity of tissue, but the opaque sclerotic overlaps the cornea rather more on its outer than on its inner surface. Structure.—The sclerotic is formed of white fibrous tissue intermixed with fine elastic fibres, and of flattened connective-tissue corpuscles, some of which are pigmented, contained in cell-spaces between the fibres. These fibres are aggre- gated into bundles, which are arranged chiefly in a longitudinal direction. It yields gelatin on boiling. Its vessels are not numerous, the capillaries being of small size, uniting at long and wide intervals. The existence of nerves in it is doubtful. Fig. 487.—A horizontal section of the eyeball. (Allen.) The Cornea is the projecting transparent part of the external tunic of the eyeball, and forms the anterior sixth of the globe. It is almost circular in shape, occasionally a little broader in the transverse than in the vertical direction. It is convex anteriorly, and projects forwards from the sclerotic in the same manner that a watch-glass does from its case. Its degree of curvature varies in different individuals, and in the same individual at different periods of life, it being more prominent in youth than in advanced life, when it becomes flattened. The cornea is dense and of uniform thickness throughout ; its posterior surface is perfectly circular in outline, and exceeds the anterior surface slightly in extent, from the latter being overlapped by the sclerotic. Structure.—The cornea consists of four layers : namely, (i) several strata! of ex)ithelial cells, continuous with those of the conjunctiva ; (2) a thick central fibrous structure, the cornea irroper ; (3) a homogeneous elastic lamina; and (4)1 a single layer of epithelial cells, forming part of the lining membrane of theTHE CORNEA 837 anterior chamber of the eyeball. The name of membrane of Descemet or Demours is given to this posterior elastic lamina and its endothelial coating. The conjunctival epithelium, which covers the front of the cornea proper, consists of several strata of epithelial cells. The lowermost cells are columnar : then follow two or three layers of polyhedral cells, some of which present ridges and furrows, similar to those found in the cuticle. Lastly, there are three or four layers of scaly epithelium, with flattened nuclei. The proper substance of the cornea is fibrous, tough, unyielding; perfectly transparent, and continuous with the sclerotic, with which it is identical in structure. It is composed of about sixty flattened lamellae, superimposed one on another. These lamellae are made up of bundles of fibrous connective tissue, the fibres of which are directly continuous with the fibres of the sclerotic. The fibres of each lamella are for the most part parallel with each other; those of alternating lamellae at right angles to each other. Fibres, however, frequently pass from one lamella to the next. The lamells; are connected with each other by an interstitial cement-sabstance, in which are spaces, the corneal spaces. The spaces are stellate in shape and have numerous offsets, by which they communicate with other spaces. Each space contains a cell, the corneal corpuscle^ which resembles in form the space in which it is contained, but does not entirely fill it. Immediately beneath the conjunctival epithelium, the cornea proper presents certain characteristic differences, which have led some anatomists to regard it as a distinct membrane, and it has been named by Bowman the anterior elastic lamina. It differs, however, from the true elastic lamina or membrane of Descemet in many essential particulars, presenting evidence of fibrillar structure, and not having the same tendency to curl inwards, or to undergo fracture, when detached from the other layers of the cornea. It consists of extremely closely interwoven fibrils, similar to those found in the rest of the cornea proper, but contains no corneal corpuscles. It seems therefore more proper to regard it as a part of the proper tissue of the cornea.* The posterior elastic lamina, which covers the proper structure of the cornea behind, presents no structure recognisable under the miscroscope. It consists of a hard, elastic, and perfectly transparent homogeneous membrane, of extreme thinness, which is not rendered opaque by either water, alcohol, or acids. It is very brittle, but its most remarkable property is its extreme elasticity, and the tendency which it presents to curl up, or roll upon itself, with the attached surface innermost, when separate from the proper substance of the cornea. Its use appears to be (as suggested by Dr. Jacob) ' to preserve the requisite permanent correct curvature of the flaccid cornea proper.' At the margin of the cornea this posterior elastic membrane breaks up into fibres to form a reticular structure at the outer angle of the anterior chamber, the intervals between the fibres forming small cavernous spaces, the spaces of Fontana. These little recesses communicate with a somewhat larger space in the substance of the sclerotic close to its junction with the cornea. This is the canal of Schlemm, or siiius circularis iridis, and, according to some authors, is a lymph canal, but according to others is a venous sinus. Some of the fibres of this reticulated structure are continued into the front of the iris, forming the liga- mentum pectinatum iridis ; while others are connected with the fore part of the sclerotic and choroid. The endothelial lining of the aqueous chamber covers the posterior surface of the posterior elastic lamina. It consists of a single layer of polygonal flattened transparent nucleated cells, similar to those found lining other serous cavities. Arteries and Nerves.—The cornea is a non-vascular structure, the capillary vessels terminating in loops at its circumierence. Lymphatic vessels have not as yet been demonstrated in it, but are represented by the channels in which the * This layer has been called by Eeichert the ' anterior limiting layer,' a name which appears more applicable to it than that of 'anterior elastic lamina.'838 ORGANS OF SENSE bundles of nerves run ; these are lined by an endothelium, and are continuous with the cell-spaces. The nerves are numerous, twenty-four to thirty-six in number (KoUiker) ; forty to forty-five (Waldeyer and Siimisch) ; they are derived from the ciliary nerves, and enter the laminated tissue of the cornea. They ramify through- out its substance in a delicate network, and their terminal filaments form a firm and closer plexus on the surface of the cornea proper beneath the epithelium. This is termed the suheijithelial ]jlexiis, and from it fibrils are given off which ramify between the epithelial cells, forming a network which is termed the intra- epithelial 2)lexus. Dissection.—In order to separate the sclerotic and cornea, so as to expose the second tunic, the eyeball should be immersed in a small vessel of water, and held between the finger and thumb. The sclerotic is then carefully incised, in the equator of the globe, till the choroid is exposed. One blade of a pair of probe-pointed scissors is now introduced through the opening thus made, and the sclerotic divided around its entire circmnference, and removed in separate portions. The front segment being then drawn forwards, the Fig, 488.—The choroid and iris. (Enlarged.) handle of the scalpel should be pressed gently against it at its connection with the iris, and these being separated, a quantity of perfectly transparent fluid will escape ; this is the aqueous humour. In the coiu'se of the dissection, the ciliary nerves may be seen lying in the loose cellular tissue between the choroid and sclerotic, or contained in delicate grooves on the inner surface of the latter membrane. Seco7ul Tunic.—This is formed by the choroid behind ; the iris and ciliary processes in front; and by the ciHary muscle, opposite the junction of the sclerotic and cornea. The choroid is the vascular and pigmentary tunic of the eyeball, investing the posterior five-sixths of the globe, and extending as far forwards as the cornea; the cihary processes being appendages of the choroid developed from its inner surface in front. The iris is the circular muscular septum, which hangs vertically behind the cornea, presenting in its centre a large circular aperture, the pupil. The cihary muscle forms the white ring observed at the point where the choroid and iris join with each other, and with the sclerotic and cornea. The Choroid is a thin, highly vascular membrane, of a dark brown or chocolate colour, which invests the posterior five-sixths of the central part of the globe. It is839 THE CHOROID pierced, behind by the optic nerve, and extends in front as far forwards as the ciliary ligament, where it is connected with the iris, and bends inwards, forming on its inner surface a series of folds or plaitings, the ciliary processes. It is thicker behind than in front. Externally, it is connected by a fine cellular web [inemhrana fusca) with the inner surface of the sclerotic. Its inner surface is smooth, and lies in contact with the retina. Structure.—The choroid consists mainly of a, dense capillary plexus and of small arteries and veins, carrying the blood to and returning it from this plexus. On its external surface, i.e. the surface next the sclerotic, is a thin membrane of fine elastic fibres, arranged in lamellag, which are covered with endothelium, and form spaces, which communicate by perforations in the sclerotic, through which the vessels and nerves enter, with the capsule of Tenon. This layer is named the lamina suprachoroidea, and is continuous with the lamina fusca of the sclerotic. Internal to this is the choroid proper, and in consequence of the small arteries and veins being arranged on the outer surface of the capillary network, it is customary to describe this as consisting of two layers : the outermost composed of small arteries and veins, with pigment-cells interspersed between them, and the inner consisting of a capillary plexus. The external layer consists, in part, of the larger branches of the short ciliary arteries which run forwards between the veins, before they bend inwards to terminate in the capillaries ; but is formed principally of veins, which are named, from their arrangement, vencB vorticoscB. They converge to four or five equidistant trunks, which pierce the sclerotic midway between the margin of the cornea and the entrance of the optic nerve. Interspersed between the vessels are lodged dark star-shaped pigment-cells, the fibrous offsets from which, communicating with similar branchings from neigh- bouring cells, form a delicate network or stroma, which towards the inner surface of the choroid loses its pigmentary character. The internal layer consists of an exceedingly fine capillary plexus, formed by the short ciliary vessels, and is known as the timica BuyscJiiana. The network is close, and finer at the hinder part of the choroid than in front. About half an inch behind the cornea its meshes become larger, and are continuous with those of the ciliary processes. On the inner surface of this tunic is a very thin, structureless, or, according to Kolliker, faintly fibrous membrane, called the lamina vitrea ; it is closely connected with the stroma of the choroid, and separates it from the pigmentary layer of the retina. The ciliary processes should now be examined. They may be exposed, either by detaching the iris from its connection with the Ciliary muscle, or by making a transverse section of the globe, and examining them from behind. Fig. 489.—The veins of the choroid. (Enlarged.)ORGANS OF SENSE 840 Th.e ciliary processes are formed by the plaiting and folding inwards of the various layers of the choroid (i.e. the choroid proper and the lamina vitrea) at its anterior margin, and are received between corresponding foldings of the suspensory ligament of the lens, thus establishing a connection between the choroid and inner tunic of the eye. They are arranged in a circle, and form a sort of plaited frill behind the iris, round the margin of the lens. They vary between sixty and eighty in number, lie side by side, and may be divided into large and small; the latter, consisting of about one-third of the entire number, are situated in the spaces between the former, but without regular alternation. The larger processes are each about one-tenth of an inch in length, and are attached by their periphery to the ciliary muscle, and are continuous with the layers of the choroid : the opposite margin is free, and rests upon the circumference of the lens. Their anterior surface is turned towards the back of the iris, with the circumference of which they are continuous. The posterior surface is closely connected with the suspensory ligament of the lens. Structure.—The ciliary processes are similar in structure to the choroid, but the vessels are larger, and have chiefly a longitudinal direction. They are covered Fig. 490.—The arteries of the choroid and iris. The sclerotic has been mostly removed. (Enlarged.) on their inner surface with a layer of black pigment-cells, continuous with the cells of the pigmentary layer of the retina, and in their stroma are also other, stellate, pigment-cells, which, however, are not so numerous as in the choroid itself, and towards the free extremities of the folds are devoid of pigment. The Iris {iris, a rainbow) has received its name from its various colours in different individuals. It is a thin, circular-shaped, contractile curtain, suspended in the aqueous humour behind the cornea, and in front of the lens, being perforated a little to the nasal side of its centre by a circular aperture, the pupil, for the transmission of light. By its circumference it is intimately connected with the choroid ; externally to this is the ciliary muscle, by which it is connected to the sclerotic and cornea; its inner edge forms the margin of the pupil; its surfaces are flattened, and look forwards and backwards, the anterior surface towards the cornea, the posterior towards the ciliary processes and lens. The circumference of the iris is connected to the cornea by a reticular structure denominated the ligamentum pectiiiatum iridis. The anterior surface of the iris is variously coloured in different individuals, and marked by lines which converge towards the pupil. The posterior surface is of a deep purple tint, from being covered by dark pigment; it is hence named uvea, from its resemblance in colour to a ripe grape.THE IRIS 841 Structure.—The iris is composed of the following structures : — 1. In front is a layer of polyhedral cells on a delicate hyaline basement- membrane. This layer is continuous with the epithelial layer of the membrane of Descemet, and in men with dark-coloured irides the cells contain pigment-granules. 2. Stroma.—The stroma consists of fibres and cells. The former are made up of fine delicate bundles of fibrous tissue, of which some few fibres have a circular direction at the circumference of the iris; but the chief mass consists of fibres radiating towards the pupil. They form, by their interlacement, a delicate mesh, in which the vessels and nerves are contained. Interspersed between the bundles of connective tissue are numerous branched cells with fine processes. Many of them in dark eyes contain pigment-granules, but in blue eyes and the pink eyes of albinos they are unpigmented. 3. The muscular fibre is involuntary, and consists of circular and radiating fibres. The circular fibres (sphincter of the pupil) surround the margin of the Fig. 491.—Section of the eye, showing the relations of the cornea, sclerotic, and ms, together with the Ciliary muscle and the cavernous spaces near the angle of the anterior chamber. (Waldeyer.) pupil on the posterior surface of the iris, like a sphincter, forming a narrow band, about one-thirtieth of an inch in width; those near the free margin being closely aggregated; those more external somewhat separated, and forming less complete circles. The radiating fibres (dilator of the pupil) converge from the circumference towards the centre, and blend with the circular fibres near the margin of the pupil. 4. Pigment.—-The situation of the pigment-cells differs in different irides. In the various shades of blue eyes, the only pigment-cells are several layers of small round or polyhedral cells, filled with dark pigment, situated on the posterior surface of the iris, and continuous with the pigmentary lining of the ciliary processes. The colour of the eye in these individuals is due to this colouring matter showing more or less through the texture of the iris. In the albino, even this pigment is absent. In the grey, brown, and black eye there are, as mentioned above, pigment-granules to be found in the cells of the stroma and in the epithelial layer on the front of the iris, to which the colour of the eye is due.ORGANS OF SENSE 842 The arteries of the iris are derived from the long and anterior cihary, and from the vessels of the ciliary processes (see page 550). The nerves of the iris are derived from the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion, and the long ciliary from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth. After reaching the iris iii the manner described above (page 744) they form a plexus around the attached margin of the iris ; from this are derived non- medullated fibres which terminate in the circular and radiating muscular fibres. Their exact mode of termination has not been ascertained. Other fibres from the plexus terminate in a network on the anterior surface of the iris. The fibres derived from the motor root of the lenticular ganglion (third nerve) supply the circular fibres,, while those derived from the sympathetic supply the radiating fibres. Memhranapupillaris.—In the foetus, the pupil is closed by a delicate transparent vascular membrane, the memhrana impillaris, which divides the space into which the iris is suspended into two distinct chambers. This membrane contains numerous minute vessels, continued from the margin of the iris to those on the front part of the capsule of the lens. These vessels have a looped arrangement, and converge towards each other without anastomosing. Between the seventh and eighth month the membrane begins to disappear, by its gradual absorption from the centre towards the circumference, and at birth only a few fragments remain. It is said sometimes to remain permanent and produce blindness. The Ciliary muscle (BoAvman) consists of unstriped fibres : it forms a greyish, semitransparent, circular band, about one-eighth of an inch broad, on the outer surface of the fore part of the choroid. It is thickest in front, and gradually becomes thinner behind. It consists of two sets of fibres, radiating and circular. The former, much the more numerous, arise at the point of junction of the cornea and sclerotic, and, passing backwards, are attached to the choroid opposite to the ciliary processes. One bundle, according to Waldeyer, is continued backwards to be inserted into the sclerotic. The circular fibres are internal to the radiating ones and to some extent unconnected Avith them, and have a circular course around the attachment of the iris. They are sometimes called the ' ring muscle ' of Miiller, and were formerly described as the ciliary ligament. The Ciliary muscle is admitted to be the chief agent in accommodation, i.e. in adjusting the eye to the vision of near objects. Mr. Bowman believed that this was effected by its compressing the vitreous body, and so causing the lens to advance ; but the view which now prevails is that the contraction of the muscle, by drawing on the ciliary processes, relaxes the suspensory ligament of the lens, thus allowing the anterior surface of the lens to become more convex. The pupil is at the same time slightly contracted.* The Retina is a delicate nervous membrane, upon the surface of which the images of external objects are received. Its outer surface is in contact with the choroid ; the inner surface with the vitreous body. Behind, it is continuous with the optic nerve ; it gradually diminishes in thicknes s from behind forwards ; and, in front, extends nearly as far forwards as the ciliary muscle, where it terminates by a jagged margin, the ora serrata. It is soft, and semitransparent in the fresh state; but soon becomes clouded, opaque, and of a pinkish tint. Exactly in the centre of the posterior part of the retina, and at a point, corresponding to the axis of the eye, in which the sense of vision is most perfect, is a round, elevated, yellowish spot, called, after its discoverer, the yellow sijot or limhus luteus (macula lutea) of Sommerring ; having a central depression at its summit, the fovea centralis. The retina in the situation of the fovea centralis is exceedingly thin; so much so that the dark colour of the choroid is distinctly seen through it; so that it presents more the appearance of a foramen, and hence the name ' foramen of Sommerring ' at first given to it. It exists only in man, the quadrumana, and some saurian reptiles. About one-tenth of an inch to the inner side of the yellow * See explanation and diagram in Power's Illustrations of some of the Princix:)al Diseases of the Eye, p. 590.843 THE EE TINA spot is the point of entrance of the optic nerve {ijoriis oioticus); here the nervous substance is shghtly raised so as to form an eminence [colliculus nervi optici) ; the arteria centraHs retinae pierces its centre. This is the only part of the surface of the retina from which the power of vision is absent. Structure.—The retina is an exceedingly complex structure, and, when exa- mined microscopically by means of sections made perpendicularly to its surface, is found to consist of ten layers, which are named from within outwards, as follows:— 1. Membrana limitans interna. 2. Fibrous layer, consisting of nerve-fibres. 3. Vesicular layer, consisting of nerve-cells. 4. Inner molecular, or granular, layer. 5. Inner nuclear layer. 6. Outer molecular, or granular, layer. 7. Outer nuclear layer. 8. Membrana limitans externa. 9. Layer of rods and cones (Jacob's membrane). 10. Pigmentary layer. I. The memhrmia limitans interna is the most internal layer of the retina, and is in contact with the hyaloid membrane of the vitreous humour. It is derived from the supporting framework of the retina, with which tissue it will be described. Fig. 492.—The arteria centralis retinse, yellow spot, etc., the anterior half of the eyeball being removed. (Enlarged.) 2. The fibrous layer is made up of nerve-fibres, the direct continuation of the fibres of the optic nerve. This nerve therefore passes through all the other layers of the retina, except the one previously mentioned, to reach its destination in the fibrous layer. As the nerve passes through the lamina cribrosa of the sclerotic coat, the fibres of which it is composed lay aside their medullary sheaths and are continued onwards, through the choroid and retina, as simple axis-cylinders. When these non-medullated fibres reach the internal surface of the retina, they radiate from their point of entrance over the surface of the retina, grouped in bundles, and in many places, according to Michel, arranged m plexuses. The layer is thickest at the optic nerve entrance, and gradually diminishes in thickness towards the or a serrata. 3. The vesicular layer consists of a single layer of large ganglion-cells ; except in the macula lutea, where there are several layers. The cells are somewhat flask- shaped ; their rounded internal margin resting on the preceding layer and sending- off a single process, which is prolonged into the fibrous layer, and is believed to beoectAns of sense 844 continuous Avith a nerve-fibre. From the opposite extremity of the cell one or more thicker processes extend into the inner molecular layer, where they divide dichotomously and become lost in its reticulum, or, according to some, pass through this layer to reach the inner nuclear layer. 4. The inner molecular layer consists of a stratum of granular-looking sub- stance, from which circumstance it is sometimes called the ' inner granular ' layer. It is made up of a dense reticulum of minute fibrils, intermingled with the fine processes of the ganglion-cells and also processes derived from certain cells contained in the next layer, immediately to be described. No direct connection between these sets of processes has yet been demonstrated, but it is considered probable that they do communicate, and that there is therefore a direct connection between the ganglion-cells of the vesicular layer and the nuclear cells of the inner nuclear layer. Within the reticulum formed by these fibrils minute clear granules, of unknown nature, are embedded. 5. The inner nuclear layer is made up of nuclear bodies, of which there are Fig. 493. Fig. 494.

Their attachment to the membrana limitans interna. three different kinds, (i) A large number of oval nuclei, which are commonly regarded as bipolar nerve-cells, and are much more numerous than either of the other kind. They consist of a large oval nuclear body placed vertically to the surface, containing a distinct nucleolus : they are surrounded by a small amount of protoplasm, which is prolonged into two processes, one of these passes inwards into the inner molecular layer, is varicose in appearance, and, as stated above, is , believed to be continuous with the processes of the ganglion-cells. The other process passes outwards, into the outer molecular layer, and there bifurcates. According to some observers the divisions thus formed communicate with the rod and cone fibres (Merkel). (2) At the innermost part of this inner nuclear layer is a stratum of cells, which are not branched. (3) Some few cells are also found in this layer, connected with the fibres of Mliller, and will be described with those structures. Jt 6. The outer molecular layer is much thinner than the inner molecular layer but, like it, consists of a dense network of minute fibrils, and presents the sam^HTHE RETINA 845 granular appearance. It differs, however, from the inner molecular layer in con- taining branched stellate cells, the processes of which are extremely fine and exhibit varicosities, like nerve-fibrils. They are therefore considered by Schultze to be ganglion-cells. 7. The outer nuclear layer.—Like the inner nuclear layer, this layer contains several strata of clear oval nuclear bodies ; they are of two kinds, and on account of their being respectively connected with the rods and cones of Jacob's membrane, are named rod-granules and cone-granules. The rod-granules are much the more numerous, and are placed at different levels throughout the layer. They present a peculiar cross-striped appearance, and have prolonged from either extremity a fine process : the outermost is continuous with a single rod of Jacob's membrane ; the innermost passes inwards towards the outer molecular layer and terminates in an enlarged extremity, from which are given off a number of minute fibrils, which enter the outer molecular layer. In its course it presents numerous varicosities. The cone-granules, fewer in number than the rod-granules, are placed close to the membrana limitans externa, and are closely connected with the cones of Jacob's membrane. They do not present any cross-striping, but contain a pyriform nucleus, which almost completely fills the cell. From their inner extremity a thick process passes inwards to the outer molecular layer ; where, like the processes of the rod-cells, it terminates in an enlargement, from which are given off numerous fine fibrils, which enter the outer molecular layer. 8. The memhrana limitans externa.—This layer, like the membrana limitans interna, is derived from the fibres of Miiller, with which structures it will be described. 9. Jacob's membrane (hacillary layer).—The elements which compose this layer are of two kinds, rods and cones, the former being much more numerous than the latter. The rods are solid, of nearly uniform size, and arranged perpendicularly to the surface. Each rod consists of two portions, an outer and inner, which are joined together by a cement-substance and are of about equal length. They differ from each other as regards refraction and in their behaviour with colouring reagents, the inner portion becoming stained by carmine, iodine, etc., the outer portion remaining unstained. The outer portion of each rod is marked by transverse strife, and is made up of a number of thin discs superimposed on one another. It also exhibits faint longitudinal markings. The inner portion of each rod, at its inner extremity where it is joined to the processes of the rod-granules, is indistinctly granular; at its outer extremity it. presents a fine longitudinal striation, being- composed of fine, bright, highly refracting fibrils. The cones are conical or flask-shaped, their broad ends resting upon the membrana limitans externa, the narrow pointed extremity being turned to the choroid. Like the rods, they are made up of two portions, outer and inner ; the outer portion being a short conical process, which, like the outer segment of the rods, presents transverse stri^. The inner portion resembles the inner portion of the rods in structure, presenting an outer striated and an inner granular appearance ; but differs from it in size, being bulged out laterally and presenting a flask shape. 10. The pigmentary layer, or tapetum nigrum.—The most external layer of the retina, formerly regarded as a part of the choroid, consists of a single layer of hexagonal epithelium cells, loaded with pigment-granules (fig. 21). In the eyes of albinos, the cells of the pigmentary layer are present, but they contain no colouring matter. In many of the mammals also, as in the horse, and many of the carnivora, there is no pigment in the cells of this layer, and the choroid possesses a beautiful iridescent lustre, which is termed the tapetiim lucidum. Connective-tissue frameioork of the retina.—Almost all these layers of the retina are connected together by a sort of supporting connective tissue, which has been named the fibres of Miiller, or radiating fibres, from which the membrana limitans interna et externa are derived. These fibres are found stretched between the two limiting layers, ' as columns between a floor and a ceiling,' and passing through all the nervous layers, except Jacob's membrane. They commence on846 OEGANS OF SENSE the inner surface of the retina by a conical base, the edges of the bases of adjoining- fibres being united and thus forming a boundary line, which is the membrana limitans interna. As they pass through the various layers, they present a roughness on their surface, as if a number of membranous processes had been abruptly broken off. By these they are continuous with the reticulum of the inner and outer molecular layer and with a sponge-like stroma, in which the nuclei of the inner nuclear layers are embedded. In the inner nuclear layer each fibre of Miiller presents a clear oval nucleus, referred to above, which is sometimes situated at the side of, sometimes altogether within the fibre. In the outer nuclear layer the fibre breaks up into fine lamellae, which form a fenestrated or sponge-like tissue, in which the rod and cone granules are enclosed, and at the outer border of this Fig. 495.—The layers of the retina (diagrammatic).

Macula lutea and fovea centralis.—The structure of the retina at the yellow spot presents some modifications. In the macula lutea (i) the nerve-fibres are wanting as a continuous layer; (2) the vesicular layer consists of several strata of cells, instead of a single layer; (3) in Jacob's membrane there are no rods, but only cones, and these are longer and narrower than in other parts ; and (4) in the outer nuclear layer there are only cone-fibres, which are very long and arranged in curved lines. At the fovea centralis the only parts which exist are the cones of Jacob's membrane ; the outer nuclear layer, the cone-fibres of which are almost horizontal in direction ; and an exceedingly thin inner granular layer. The colour of the spot seems to imbue all the layers except Jacob's membrane ; it is of a richVITREOUS BODY 847 yellow, deepest towards the centre, and does not appear to consist of pigment-cells, but simply a staining of the constituent parts. At tJie ora'serrata the layers of the retina for the most part terminate abruptly, and the radiating fibres of Miiller, covered by the pigmentary layer, can be traced forwards, as the pars ciliaris, to the iris. The fibres of Miiller here present the appearance of columnar epithelial cells, arranged in a single stratum. The arteria centralis retince and its accompanying vein pierce the optic nerve, and enter the globe of the eye through the porus opticus. It immediately divides into four or five branches, which at first run between the hyaloid membrane and the nervous layer ; but they soon enter the latter membrane, and pass forwards, dividing dichotomously. From these branches a minute capillary plexus is given off, which does not extend beyond the inner nuclear layer. In the foetus, a small vessel passes forwards, through the vitreous humour, to the posterior surface of the capsule of the lens. Humours of the Eye The aqueous humour completely fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eyeball. It is small in quantity (scarcely exceeding, according to Petit, four or five grains in weight), has an alkaline reaction, in composition is little more than water, less than one-fiftieth of its weight being solid matter, chiefly chloride of sodium. The anterior cha^nber is the space bounded in front by the cornea ; behind, by the front of the iris. The posterior chamber was the name formerly given to a space which was believed to exist between the iris in front and the capsule of the lens, its suspensory ligament and the ciliary processes, behind. It is now known that the posterior surface of the iris is in immediate contact with the lens throughout the greater part of its extent. The only space which remains, to represent the posterior chamber, is a narrow chink between the peripheral part of the iris, the suspensory ligament and the ciliary processes. In the adult, these two chambers communicate through the pupil; but in the foetus in the seventh month, when the pupil is closed by the membrana pupillaris, the two chambers are quite separate. Vitreous Body The vitreous body forms about four-fifths of the entire globe. It fills the con- cavity of the retina, and is hollowed in front for the reception of the lens and its capsule. It is perfectly transparent, of the consistence of thin jelly, and is composed of an albuminous fluid enclosed in a delicate transparent membrane, the hyaloid. This membrane invests the outer surface of the vitreous body; it is intimately connected in front Avith the suspensory ligament of the lens ; and is continued into the back part of the capsule of the lens. It has been supposed, by Hannover, that from its inner surface numerous thin lamellae are prolonged inwards in a radiating manner, forming spaces in which the fluid is contained. In the adult, these lamellae cannot be detected even after careful microscopic examination ; but in the foetus a peculiar fibrous texture pervades the mass, the fibres joining at numerous points, and presenting minute nuclear granules at their point of junction. In the centre of the vitreous humour, running from the position of the entrance of the optic nerve on the retina to the posterior surface of the lens, is a canal, filled with fluid and lined by a prolongation of the hyaloid membrane. This is the canal of Stilling, and is the canal which in the embryonic vitreous humour conveyed the minute artery from the central artery of the retina to the back of the lens. The fluid from the vitreous body resembles nearly pure water; it contains, however, some salts, and a little albumen. The hyaloid membrane encloses the whole of the vitreous humour, except its anterior surface, which is hollowed out for the reception of the lens ; it passes from the margin of this surface to the margin of the lens, forming the suspensory848 ORGANS OF SENSE ligament. It is a delicate structureless membrane, except where it forms the suspensory ligament, where it contains longitudinal elastic fibres. Immediately beneath the hyaloid membrane are found small, granular, nucleated cells, which are said to be possessed of amoeboid movements. In the fcetus, the centre of the vitreous humour presents a tubular canal, through which a minute artery passes along the vitreous body to the capsule of the lens. In the adult, no vessels penetrate its substance ; so that its nutrition must be carried on by the vessels of the retina and ciliary processes, situated upon its exterior. Cbystalline Lens and its Capsule The crystalline lens, enclosed in its capsule, is situated immediately behind the pupil, in front of the vitreous body, and surrounded by the ciliary processes, which slightly overlap its margin. The capsule of the lens is a transparent, highly elastic, and brittle membrane, which closely surrounds the lens. It rests, behind, in a depression in the fore part of the vitreous body; in front, it is in contact with the free border of the iris, this latter receding from it at the circumference, thus forming the posterior chamber of the eye ; and it is retained in its position chiefly by the suspensory ligament of the lens. The capsule is much thicker in front than behind, structureless in texture ; and when ruptured, the edges roll up with the outer surface innermost, like the elastic lamina of the cornea. The anterior surface of the lens is connected to the inner surface of the capsule by a single layer of transparent, polygonal, nucleated cells. At the circumference of the lens, these Fig. 496.—The crystalline lens, cells undergo a change in form: they become hardened and divided. elongated, and Babucin states that he can trace (Enlarged.) the gradual transition of the cells into proper lens-fibres, with which they are directly con- tinuous. There is no epithelium on the pos- terior surface. In the foetus, a small branch from the arteria centralis retinae runs forwards, as al- ready mentioned, through the vitreous humour to the posterior part of the capsule of the lens, where its branches radiate and form a plexiform network, which covers its surface, and they are continuous round the margin of the capsule with the vessels of the pupillary membrane, and with those of the iris. In the adult no vessels enter its substance. The lens is a transparent, double-convex body, the convexity being greater on the posterior than on the anterior surface. It measures about a third of an inch in the transverse diameter, and about one-fourth jin the antero-posterior. It consists of concentric layers, of which the external in the fresh state are soft and easily detached; those beneath are firmer, the central ones forming a hardened nucleus. These laminae are best demonstrated by boiling, or immersion in alcohol. The same reagents demonstrate that the lens consists of three triangular segments, the sharp edges of which are directed towards the centre, the bases towards the circumference. The laminas consist of minute parallel fibres, which are hexagonal prisms, the edges being dentated, and the dentations fitting accurately into each other; their breadth is about ^-Q^-th of an inch. They run from the sutures or lines of junction of the triangular segments, on the one surface, to the periphery of the lens, and, curving round its margin, they terminate at the line of junction of the segments on the other. No fibres pass from pole to pole, but they are arranged in such a way that fibres which commence near the pole on the one aspect of the lens—that is to say, near the apex of the triangular segment— terminate near the peripheral extremity of the plane on the other, or near the base of the triangular segment, and vice versa. The fibres of the outer layers of the849 CRYSTALLINE LENS AND ITS CAPSULE lens each contain a nucleus, which together form a layer (nuclear layer) on the surface of the lens, most distinct towards its circumference. The meridians, or lines of junction of the three segments, are composed of an amorphous granular substance which sometimes becomes opaque, when the lines are seen forming a distinct star on the lens. The lines on one surface do not lie immediately opposite those on the other, but are intermediate. The changes produced in the lens by age are the following :— In the foetus, its form is nearly spherical, its colour of a slightly reddish tint, it is not perfectly transparent, and is so soft as to break down readily on the slightest pressure. In the adult, the posterior surface is more convex than the anterior ; it is colourless, transparent, and firm in texture. In old age it becomes flattened on both surfaces, slightly opaque, of an amber tint, and increases in density. The susijensory ligament of the lens is a thin, transparent, membranous struc- ture, placed between the vitreous body and the ciliary processes of the choroid; it connects the anterior margin of the vitreous humour with the anterior surface of the lens near its circumference. It assists in retaining the lens in its position. Its outer surface presents a number of folds or plaitings in which the corresponding folds of the ciliary processes are received. These plaitings are arranged round the lens in a radiating form, and are stained by the pigment of the ciliary processes. The suspensory ligament is a part of the hyaloid membrane, which, as described above, is continued forwards to the anterior part of the margin of the lens. It is covered on its outer surface by the pars ciliaris, or connective-tissue framework of the retina, prolonged forwards from the ora serrata. That portion of this membrane which intervenes between the ciliary processes and the capsule of the lens forms i^art of the boundary of the posterior chamber of the eye. The posterior surface of this layer is turned towards the vitreous humour, being separated from it at the circumference of the lens by a space called the canal of Petit. The canal of Petit is about one-tenth of an inch wide. It is bounded, in front, by the suspensory ligament; behind, by the vitreous humour, its base being formed by the capsule of the lens. When inflated with air, it is sacculated at intervals, owing to the foldings on its anterior surface. The arteries of the globe of the eye are the short, long, and anterior ciliary arteries, and the arteria centralis retinae. They have been already described (see page 550). _ ^ The ciliary veins are seen on the outer surface of the choroid, and are named, from their arrangement, the ven(B vorticosce. They converge to four or five equidistant trunks which pierce the sclerotic midway between the margin of the cornea and the entrance of the optic nerve. Another set of veins accompany the anterior ciliary arteries and open into the ophthalmic vein. The ciliary nerves are derived from the nasal branch of the ophthalmic and from the ciliary or ophthalmic ganglion. Surgical Anatomy.—Foreign bodies frequently get into the conjunctival sac and cause great pain, especially if they come in contact with the corneal surface, during the move- ments of the lid and the eye on each other. The conjunctiva is frequently involved in severe injuries of the eyeball, but is seldom ruptured alone; the most common form of injury to the conjunctiva alone is from a burn, either from fire, strong acids, or lime. In these cases union is liable to take place between the eyelid and the eyeball. The conjunctiva is often the seat of inflammation arising from many different causes, and the arrangement of the conjunctival vessels should be remembered as affording a means of diagnosis between this condition and injection of the sclerotic, which is present in inflammations of the deeper structures of the globe. The inflamed conjunctiva is bright red; the vessels are large and tortuous, and greatest at the circumference, shading off towards the corneal margin; they anastomose freely and form a dense network, and they can be emptied or displaced by gentle pressure. From a surgical point of view the cornea may be regarded as consisting of three layers : (i) of an external epithelial layer, developed from the epiblast, and continuous with the external epithelial covering of the rest of the body, and therefore in its lesions resembling those of the epidermis and superficial layers of the derma ; (2) of the cornea proper, derived 31850 OKGANS OF SENSE from the mesoblast, and associated in its diseases with the fibro-vascular structures of the body ; and (3) the posterior elastic layer with its endothelium, also derived from the mesoblast and having the characters of a serous membrane, so that inflammation of it resembles inflammation of the other serous and synovial membranes of the body. The cornea contains no blood-vessels except at its periphery, where numerous delicate loops, derived from the anterior ciliary arteries, may be demonstrated on the anterior surface of the cornea. The rest of the cornea is nourished by lymph, which gains access to the proper substance of the cornea and the posterior layer through the spaces of Fontana. This lack of a direct blood-supply renders the cornea very apt to inflame in the cachectic and ill-nourished. In cases of granular lids, there is a peculiar affection of the cornea, called pannus, in which the anterior layers of the cornea become vascularised, and a rich network of blood-vessels may be seen on the cornea ; and in interstitial keratitis new A^essels extend into the cornea, giving it a pinkish hue, to which the term ' salmon patch ' is applied. The cornea is richly supplied with nerves, derived from the ciliary, which enter the cornea through the fore part of the sclerotic and form plexuses in the stroma, terminating between the epithelial cells by free ends or in corpuscles. In cases of glaucoma the ciliary nerves may be pressed upon as they course between the choroid and sclerotic, and the cornea becomes anaesthetic. The sclerotic has very few blood-vessels and nerves. The blood-vessels are derived from the anterior ciliary, and form an open plexus in its substance. As they approach the corneal margin this arrangement is peculiar. Some branches pass through the sclerotic to the ciliary body; others become superficial and lie in the episcleral tissue, and form arches, by anastomosing with each other, some little distance behind the corneal margin. From these arches numerous straight vessels are given off, which run forwards to the cornea, forming its marginal plexus. In inflammation of the sclerotic and episcleral tissue these vessels become conspicuous, and form a pinkish zone of straight vessels radiating from the corneal margin, commonly known as the zone of ciliary injection. In inflammation of the iris and ciliary body this zone is present, since the sclerotic speedily becomes involved when these structures are inflamed. But in inflammation of the cornea the sclerotic is seldom much afi^ected, though the cornea and sclerotic are structurally continuous. This would appear to be due to the fact, that the nutrition of the cornea is derived from a different source from that of the sclerotic. The sclerotic may be ruptured subcutaneously without any laceration of the conjunctiva, and the rupture usually occurs near the corneal margin, where the tunic is thinnest. It may be complicated with lesions of adjacent parts—laceration of the choroid, retina, iris, or suspensory ligament of the lens—and is then often attended with haemorrhage into the anterior chamber, which masks the nature of the injury. In some cases the lens has escaped through the rent in the sclerotic and has been found under the conjunctiva. Wounds of the sclerotic are always dangerous, and are often followed by inflammation, suppuration, and by sympathetic ophthalmia. The function of the choroid is to provide nutrition for the retina, and to convey vessels and nerves to the ciliary body and iris. Inflammation of the choroid is therefore followed by grave disturbance in the nutrition of the retina, and is attended with early interference with vision. In its diseases it bears a considerable analogy to those which affect the skin, and, like it, is one of the places from which melanotic sarcomata may grow. These tumours contain a large amount of pigment in their cells, and grow only from those parts where pigment is naturally present. The choroid may be ruptured, without injury to the other tunics, as well as participating in general injuries of the eyeball. In cases of uncom- plicated rupture, the injury is usually at its posterior part, and is the result of a blow on the front of the eye. It is attended by considerable haemorrhage, which for a time may obscure vision, but, in most cases, this is restored, as soon as the blood is absorbed. The iris is the seat of a malformation, termed coIoboDia, which consists in a deficiency or cleft, which in a great number of cases is clearly due to an arrest in development. In these cases it is found at the lower aspect, extending directh' downwards from the pupil, and the gap frequently extends through the choroid to the entrance of the optic nerve. In some rarer cases the gap is found in other parts of the iris, and is then not associated with any deficiency of the choroid. The iris is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels and nerves, and is therefore very prone to become inflamed. And when inflamed, in consequence of the intimate relationship which exists between the vessels of the iris and choroid, this latter tunic is very apt to participate in the inflammation. And, in addition, inflammation of adjacent structures, the cornea and sclerotic, is apt to spread into the iris. The iris is covered with epithelium, and partakes of the character of a serous membrane, and, like these structures, is liable to pour out a plastic exudation, when inflamed, and contract adhesions, either to the cornea in front (synechia anterior), or to the capsule of the lens behind {synechia i^osterior). In iritis the lens may become involved, and the condition known as secondary cataract may be set up. Tumours occasionally commence in the iris; of these, cysts, which are usually congenital and sarcomatous tumours, are the most common and require removal. Gummata are not unfrequently found in this situation. In some forms of injury of the eyeball, as the impact of a spent shot, the rebound of a twig, or a blow with a whip, the iris may be detached from the ciliary muscle, the amount of detachment varying from the slightest degree to separation of the whole iris from its ciliary connection.APPENDAGES OF THE EYE The retina, with the exception of its pigment-layer and its vessels, is perfectly transparent, so as to be invisible when examined by the ophthalmoscope, so that its diseased conditions are recognised by its loss of transparency. In retinitis, for instance, there is more or less dense and extensive opacity of its structure, and not unfrequently extravasations of blood into its substance. Haemorrhages may also take place into the retina, from rupture of a blood-vessel without inflammation. The retina may become displaced from effusion of serum between it and the choroid, or by blows on the eyeball, or may occur without apparent cause in progressive myopia, and in this case the ophthalmoscope shows an opaque, tremulous cloud. Glioma, a form of sarcoma, and essentially a disease of early life, is occasionally met with in connection with the retina. The lens has no blood-vessels, nerves, or connective tissue in its structure, and therefore is not subject to those morbid changes to which tissues containing these structures are liable. It does however present certain morbid or abnormal conditions of various kinds. Thus, variations in shape, absence of the whole or a part of the lens, and displacements are amongst its congenital defects. Opacities may occur from injury, senile changes, malnutrition, or errors in growth or development. Senile changes may take place in the lens, impairing its elasticit.y and rendering it harder than in youth, so that its curvature can only be altered to a limited extent by the Ciliary muscle. And, finally, the lens may be dislocated or displaced by blows upon the eyeball; and its relations to surrounding structures altered by adhesions or the pressure of new growths. There are two particular regions of the eye which require special notice : one of these is known as the 'filtration area,' and the other as the ' dangerous area.' The filtration area is the circumcorneal zone immediately in front of the iris. Here are situated the cavernous spaces of Fontana, which communicate with the canal of Schlemm, through which the chief transudation of fluid from the eye is now believed to take place. The dangerous area of the eye is the region in the neighbourhood of the ciliary body, and wounds or injuries in this situation are peculiarly dangerous. For inflammation of the ciliary body is liable to spread to many of the other structures of the eye, especially to the iris and choroid, which are intimately connected by nervous and vascular supplies. Moreover, wounds which involve the ciliary region are especially liable to be followed by sympathetic ophthalmia, in which destructive inflammation of one eye is excited by some irritation in the other. Appendages of the Eye The appendages of the eye (tutamina oculi) include the eyebrows, the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the lachrymal apparatus, viz. the lachrymal gland, the lachrymal sac, and the nasal duct. The eyebrows (supercilia) are two arched eminences of integument, which surmount the upper circumference of the orbit on each side, and support numerous short, thick hairs, directed obliquely on the surface. In structure, the eyebrows consist of thickened integument, connected beneath with the Orbicularis palpe- brarum, Corrugator supercilii, and Occipito-frontalis muscles. These muscles serve, by their action on this part, to control to a certain extent the amount of light admitted into the eye. The eyelids (jjaljjehrce) are two thin, movable folds, placed in front of the eye, protecting it from injury by their closure. The upper lid is the larger, and the more movable of the two, and is furnished with a separate elevator muscle, the Levator palpebrcs superioris. When the eyelids are opened, an elliptical space (fissura palpehrarmn) is left between their margins, the angles of which corre- spond to the junction of the upper and lower lids, and are called cantJii. The outer canthus is more acute than the inner, and the lids here lie in close contact with the globe: but the inner canthus is prolonged for a short distance inwards, towards the nose, and the two lids are separated by a triangular space, the lacus lachrymalis. At the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, on the margin of each eyelid, is a small conical elevation, the lachrymal papilla, or tubercle, the apex of which is pierced by a small orifice, the ptmctum lachrymale, the commence- ment of the lachrymal canal. The eyelashes {cilia) are attached to the free edges of the eyelids; they are short, thick, curved hairs, arranged in a double or triple row at the margin of the lids: those of the upper lid, more numerous and longer than the lower, curve upwards ; those of the lower lid curve downwards, so that they do not interlace in closing the lids. Near the attachment of the eyelashes are the openings of a number of glands, glands of Mohl, arranged in several rows close to the free 3 I 2ORGANS OF SENSE margin of the lid. They resemble in structoe a portion of a sweat-gland, and are regarded as the modified sweat-glands of this region. Structure of the eyelids.—The eyelids are composed of the following structm^es, taken in their order from without inwards :— Integument, areolar tissue, fibres of the Orbicularis muscle, tarsal plate (cartilage), and its ligament, Meibomian glands and conjunctiva. The upper lid has, in addition, the aponeurosis of the Levator palpebrse. The integument is extremely thin, and continuous at the margin of the lids with the conjunctiva. The subcutaneous areolar tissue is very lax and delicate, seldom contains any fat, and is extremely liable to serous infiltration. The fibres of the Orbicularis muscle, where they cover the palpebr^e, are thin, pale in colour, and possess an involuntary action. The tarsal plates {cartilages)^ are two thin elongated plates of dense connective tissue, about an inch in length. They are placed one in each lid, contributing to their form and support. The superior, the larger, is of a semilunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at the centre, and becoming gradually narrowed at each extremity. Into the anterior surface of this plate the aponeurosis of the Levator palpebrae is attached. The inferior tarsal plate, the smaller, is thinner, and of an elliptical form. The free or ciliary margin of these plates is thick, and presents a perfectly straight edge. The attacked or orbital margin is connected to the circumference of the orbit by the fibrous membrane of the lids with which it is continuous. The outer angle of each plate is attached to the malar bone by the external palpebral or tarsal ligament. The inner angles of the two plates terminate at the commencement of the lacus lachrymalis, being fixed to the margins of the orbit by the tendo oculi. The tarsal liga^nent, or fibrous membrane of the lids, is a layer of fibrous membrane, beneath the Orbicularis, attached marginally to the edge of the orbit, where it becomes continuous with the periosteum, and centrally to the tarsal plate, near its ciliary margin, with the tissue of which it is continuous. It is thickest and densest at the outer part of the orbit. Upon its under surface is a layer of unstriped muscle, which in the upper lid passes from the aponeurosis of the Levator palpebr^e muscle to the tarsal plate. This ligament serves to support the eyelids, and retains the tarsal plates in their position. The Meibomian glands (fig. 497) are situated upon the inner surface of the eyelids, between the tarsal plates and conjunctiva, and may be distinctly seen through the mucous membrane on everting the eyelids, presenting the appearance of parallel strings of pearls. They are about thirty in number in the upper eyelid, and somewhat fewer in the lower. They are embedded in grooves in the inner surface of the tarsal plates, and correspond in length with the breadth of each plate; they are, consequently, longer in the upper than in the lower eyelid, Their ducts open on the free margin of the lids by minute foramina, which correspond in number to the follicles. The peculiar parallel arrangement of these glands, side by side, forms a smooth layer adapted to the surface of the globe, over which they constantly glide. The use of their secretion is to prevent adhesions of the lids. Structure of the Meibomian glands.—These glands are a variety of the cutaneous sebaceous glands, each consisting of a single straight tube or follicle, having a csecal termination, and with numerous small secondary follicles opening into it. The tubes consist of basement-membrane, covered by a layer of scaly epithelium; the secondary follicles are lined by a layer of polyhedral cells, continuous with the cells of the tube. The remainder of the follicle is filled with large polyhedral cells, charged with fat. They are thus identical in structure with the sebaceous glands. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane of the eye. It lines the inner surface * Eecent observations have proved that the so-called ' tarsal cartilages ' do not contain any cartilage-cells, and that the name is a misnomer.THE CONJUNCTIVA 853 of the eyelids, and is reflected over the fore part of the sclerotic and cornea. In each of these situations, its structure presents some peculiarities. The imlpehral portion of the conjunctiva is thick, opaque, highly vascular, and covered with numerous papillae, its deeper parts presenting a considerable amount of lymphoid tissue. At the margin of-the lids it becomes continuous with the lining membrane of the ducts of the Meibomian glands, and, through the lachrymal canals, with the lining membrane of the lachrymal sac and nasal duct. At the outer angle of the upper lid it may be traced along the lachrymal ducts into the lachrymal gland; and at the inner angle of the eye it forms a semilunar fold, the plica semilunaris. The folds formed by the reflection of the conjunctiva from the lids on to the eye are called the superior and inferior palpebral folds, the former being the deeper of the two. Upon the sclerotic, the conjunctiva is loosely connected to the globe: it becomes thinner, loses its pai^illary structure, is transparent, and only slightly vascular in health. Upon the cornea, the con- junctiva consists only of epithelium, constituting the anterior layer of the cornea (conjunctival epithelium) already described (see page 837). Lymphatics arise in the conjunctiva in a delicate zone around the cornea, from which the vessels run to the ocular conjunctiva. Fig. 497.—The Meibomian glands, etc., seen from the inner surface of the eyelids. Puncta lachrymalia At the point of reflection of the conjunctiva from the lid on to the globe of the eye, termed the fornix conjunctives, are a number of mucous glands, which are much convoluted. They are chiefly found in the upper lid. Other glands, analogous to lymphoid follicles, and called by Henle trachoma glands, are found in the con- junctiva, and, according to Strohmeyer, are chiefly situated near the inner canthus of the eye. They were first described by Brush, in his description of Peyer's patches of the small intestines, as ' identical structures existing in the under eyelid of the ox.' The nerves in the conjunctiva are numerous and form rich plexuses. According to Krause, they terminate in a peculiar form of tactile corpuscle, which he terms ' terminal bulb.' The caru7icula lachrymalis is a small, reddish, conical-shaped body, situated at the inner canthus of the eye, and filling up the small triangular space in this situa- tion, the lacus.^lachrymalis. It consists of a cluster of follicles similar in structure to the Meibomian, covered with mucous membrane, and is the source of the whitish secretion which constantly collects at the inner angle of the eye. A few slender hairs are attached to its surface. On the outer side of the caruncula is a slight semilunar fold of mucous membrane, the concavity of which is directed towards the cornea ; it is called the j;Zica semilimaris. Miiller found smooth muscular fibresOEGANS OF SENSE 854 in this fold, and in some of the domesticated animals a thin plate of cartilage has been discovered. This structm^e is considered to be the rudiment of the third eyelid in birds, the memhrana nictitans. Lachrymal Apparatus (fig. 498) The lachrym.al apparatus consists of the lachrymal gland, which secretes the tears, and its excretory ducts, which convey the fluid to the surface of the eye. This fluid is carried away by the lachrymal canals into the lachrymal sac, and along the nasal duct into the cavity of the nose. The lachrymal gland is lodged in a depression at the outer angle of the orbit, on the inner side of the external angular process of the frontal bone. It is of an oval form, about the size and shape of an almond. Its upper convex surface is in contact with the periosteum of the orbit, to which it is connected by a few fibrous bands. Its under concave surface rests upon the convexity of the eyeball, and upon the Superior and External recti muscles. Its vessels and nerves enter its posterior border, whilst its anterior margin is closely adherent to the back part of the upper eyelid, where it is covered to a slight extent by the reflection of the con- junctiva. The fore part of the gland is separated from the rest by a fibrous septum ; Fig. 498.—The lachrymal apparatus. Eight side. a ?* m\ hence it is sometimes described as a separate lobe, called the palpebral portion of the gland (accessory gland of Bosenmuller). Its ducts, about seven in number, run obliquely beneath the mucous membrane for a short distance, and, separating from each other, open by a series of minute orifices on the upper and outer half of the conjunctiva, near its reflection on to the globe. These orifices are arranged in a row, so as to disperse the secretion over the surface of the membrane. Structure of the lachrymal gland.—In structure and general appearance the lachrymal resembles the serous salivary glands (page 890). In the recent state the cells are so crowded with granules that their limits can hardly be defined. They contain an oval nucleus, and the cell protoplasm is finely fibrillated. The lachrymal canals commence at the minute orifices, pimcta lachrymalia, on the summit of a small conical elevation, the lachrymal papilla, seen on the margin of the hds, at the outer extremity of the lacus lachrymahs. The superior canal, the smaller and shorter of the two, at first ascends, and then bends at an acute angle, and passes inwards and downwards to the lachrymal sac. The inferior canal at first descends, and then, abruptly changing its course, passes almost horizontally inwards to the lachrymal sac. They are dense and elastic in structure and someAvhat dilated at their angle. The mucous membrane is covered with scaly epithelium.LACHRYMAL APPARATUS The lachrymal sac is the upper dilated extremity of the nasal duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lachrymal bone and nasal process of the superior maxillary. It is oval in form, its upper extremity being closed in and rounded, whilst below it is continued into the nasal duct. It is covered by a fibrous expansion derived from the tendo oculi, and on the inner side it is crossed by the Tensor tarsi muscle (Horner's muscle, page 371) which is attached to the ridge on the lachrymal bone. Structure.—It consists of a fibrous elastic coat, lined internally by mucous membrane : the latter being continuous, through the lachrymal canals, with the mucous lining of the conjunctiva, and through the nasal duct with the pituitary membrane of the nose. The nasal duct is a membranous canal, about three-quarters of an inch in length, w^hich extends from the lower part of the lachrymal sac to the inferior meatus of the nose, where it terminates by a somewhat expanded orifice, provided with an imperfect valve, the valve of Hasner, formed by the mucous membrane. It is contained in an osseous canal, formed by the superior maxillary, the lachrymal, and the inferior turbinated bones, is narrower in the middle than at each extremity, and takes a direction downwards, backwards, and a little outwards. It is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous below with the pituitary lining of the nose. This membrane in the lachrymal sac and nasal duct is covered with cihated epithelium as in the nose. S'lirface Form.—The palpebral fissure, or opening between the eyelids, is elliptical in shape, and differs in size in different individuals and in different races of mankind. In the Mongolian races, for instance, the opening is very small, merely a narrow fissure, and this makes the eyeball appear small in these races, whereas the size of the eye is relatively very constant. The normal direction of the fissm'-e is slightly oblique, in a direction upwards and.outwards, so that the outer angle is on a slightly higher level than the inner. This is especially noticeable in the Mongolian races, in whom, owing to the upward projection of the malar bone and the shortness of the external angular process of the frontal bone, the tarsal plate of the upper lid is raised at its outer part, and gives an oblique direction to the palpebral fissure. When the eyes are directed forwards, as in ordinary vision, the upper part of the cornea is covered by the upper lid, and the lower margin of the cornea corresponds to the level of the lower lid, so that about the lower three-fourths of the cornea is exposed under ordinary circumstances. On the margins of the lids, about a quarter of an inch from the inner canthus, are two small openings, the pimcta lachrymalia, the commencement of the lachrymal canals. They are best seen by everting the eyelids. In the natural condition they are in contact with the conjunctiva of the eyei3all, and are maintained in this position by the Tensor tarsi muscle, so that the tears running over the surface of the globe easily find their way into the lachrymal canals. The position of the lachrymal sac into which the canals open is indicated by a little tubercle (page 195), which is plainly to be felt on the lower margin of the orbit. The lachrymal sac lies immediately above and to the inner side of this tubercle, and a knife passed through the skin in this situation would open the cavity. The position of the lachrymal sac may also be indicated by the tendo oculi, or internal tarsal ligament. If both lids be drawn outwards so as to tense the skin at the inner angle, a prominent cord will be seen beneath the tightened skin. This is the tendo oculi, which lies immediately over the lachrymal sac, bisecting it, and thus forming a useful guide to its situation. A knife entered immediately beneath the tense cord would open the lower part of the sac. A probe introduced through this opening can be readily passed downwards through the duct into the inferior meatus of the nose. The direction of the duct is downwards, outwards, and backwards, and this course should be borne in mind in passing the probe, otherwise the point may be driven through the thin bony walls of the canal. A convenient plan is to direct the probe in such a manner, that if it were pushed onwards it would strike the first molar tooth of the lower jaw on the same side of the body. In other words, the surgeon standing in front of his patient should carry in his mind the position of the first molar tooth, and should push his probe onwards in such a way as if he desired to reach this structure. Beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone, the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle of the eye can be plainly felt by pushing the finger backwards between the upper and inner angle of the eye and the roof of the orbit; passing backwards and outwards from this pulley the tendon can be felt for a short distance. Surgical Anatomy.—The eyelids are composed of various tissues, and consequently are liable to a variety of diseases. The skin which covers them is exceedingly thin and delicate, and is supported on a quantity of loose and lax subcutaneous tissue, which contains no fat. In consequence of this it is very freely movable, and is liable to be856 ORGANS OF SENSE drawn down by the contraction of neighbouring cicatrices, and thus produce an aversion of the hd, known as ectrojnoji. Inversion of the hds {entropion), from spasm of the Orbicu- laris palpebrarum or ft'om chronic inflammation of the palpebral conjunctiva may also occur. The eyelids are richly supplied with blood, and are often the seat of vascular growths, such as naevi. Eodent ulcer also frequently commences in this situation. The loose cellular tissue beneath the skin is liable to become extensively infiltrated either with blood or inflammatory products, producing very great swelling. Even from very slight mjuries to this tissue, the extravasation of blood may be so great as to produce considerable swelling of the lids and complete closure of the eye, and the same is the case when inflammatory products are poured out. The follicles of the eyelashes or the sebaceous glands associated with these follicles, may be the seat of inflammation, constituting the ordinary' sty.' The Meibomian glands are affected in the so-called ' tarsal tumour: ' the tumour, according to some, being caused by the retained secretion of these glands ; by others it is believed to be a neoplasm connected with the gland. The ciliary follicles are liable to become inflamed, constituting the disease known as blepharitis cilai'is or ' blear eye.' Irregular or disorderl}^ growth of the eyelashes not unfrequently occurs; some of them being turned towards the eyeball and producing inflammation and ulceration of the cornea, and possibly eventually complete destruction of the eye. The Orbicularis palpebrarum ma^^ be the seat of spasm, either in the form of slight quivering of the lids ; or repeated twitchings, most commonly due to errors of refraction in children ; or more continuous spasm, due to some irritation of the fifth or seventh cranial nerve. The Orbicularis may be paralysed, generally associated with paralysis of the other facial muscles. Under these circumstances, the patient is unable to close the lids, and, if he attempts to do so, rolls the eyeball upwards under the upper lid. The tears overflow from displacement of the lower lid, and the conjunctiva and cornea, being constantly exposed and the patient being imable to winlt, become irritated from dust and foreign bodies. In paralysis of the Levator palpebrae superioris there is drooping of the upper eyelid and other symptoms of implication of the third nerve. The eyelids may be the seat of bruises, wounds, or bm-ns. In these latter injuries, adhesions of the margins of the lids to each other, or adhesion of the lids to the globe may take place. The eyelids are sometimes the seat of emphj^sema, after fracture of some of the thin bones forming the inner wall of the orbit. If shortly after such an injury the patient blows his nose, air is forced from the nostril through the lacerated structures into the connective tissue of the eyelids, which suddenly swell up and present the peculiar crackling characteristic of this affection. The lachr^^mal gland is occasionally, though rarely, the seat of inflammation, either acute or chronic ; it is also sometimes the seat of tumours, benign or malignant, and for these may require removal. This may be done by an incision through the skin, just below the eyebrow; and the gland, being invested with a special capsule of its own, may be isolated and removed, without opening the general cavity of the orbit. The canaliculi may be obstructed, either as a congenital defect, or by some foreign body, as an eyelash or a dacrj-olith, causing the tears to run over the cheek. The canaliculi may also become occluded as the result of burns or injury; overflow of the tears may in addition result from deviation of the puncta, or from chronic inflammation of the lachrymal sac. This latter condition is set up by some obstruction to the nasal duct, frequently occurring in tubercular subjects. In consequence of this the tears and mucus accumulate in the lachrymal sac, distending it. Suppuration m the lachrymal sac is sometimes met with; this may be the sequel of a chronic inflammation ; or may occur after some of the eruptive fevers, in cases wdiere the lachrymal passages were previously quite health^'. It may lead to lachrymal fistula. THE EAR The organ of hearing is divisible into three parts : the external ear, the middle ear or tympanum, and the internal ear or labyrinth. The external ear consists of an expanded portion named pinna or auricle, and the auditory canal, or meatus. The former serves to collect the vibrations of the air by which sound is produced ; the latter conducts those vibrations to the tympanum. The pinna, or auricle (fig. 498), is of an ovoid form, with its larger end directed upwards. Its outer surface is irregularly concave, directed slightly forwards, and presents numerous eminences and depressions which result from the foldings of its fibro-cartilaginous element. To each of these, names have been assigned. Thus the external prominent rim of the auricle is called the helix. Another curved prominence, parallel with and in front of the helix, is called the antihelix; this bifurcates above, so as to enclose a triangular depression, the fossa of the antihelix. The narrow curved depression between the helix and antihelix is called the fossa of the helix {fossa innominata or scaphoidea); the antihelix describes a curve round a deep, capacious cavity, the concha which is partially divided into two857 THE EAR parts by the commencement of the hehx. In front of the concha, and projecting backwards over the meatus, is a small pointed eminence, the tragus : so called from its being generally covered on its under surface with a tuft of hair, resem- bling a goat's beard. Opposite the tragus, and separated from it by a deep notch {incisura mtertragica), is a small tubercle, the antitragus. Below this is the lobule, composed of tough areolar and adipose tissue, wanting the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. Structure of the pinna.—The pinna is composed of a thin plate of yellow fibro- cartilage, covered with integument, and connected to the surrounding parts by the extrinsic ligaments and muscles; and to the commencement of the external auditory canal. The integument is thin, closely adherent to the cartilage, and furnished with sebaceous glands, which are most numerous in the concha and scaphoid fossa. The cartilage of the pinna consists of one single piece : it gives form to this Fig. 499.—The pinna, or auricle. Fig. 500.—The muscles of the pinna. Outer surface. thus it does not form a constituent part of the lobule ; it is deficient, also, between the tragus and beginning of the helix, the notch between them being filled up by dense fibrous tissue. At the front part of the pinna, where the helix bends upwards, is a small projection of cartilage, called the process of the helix. The cartilage of the pinna presents several intervals or fissures in its substance, which partially separate the different parts. The fissure of the helix is a short vertical slit, situated at the fore part of the pinna, immedi- ately behind a small conical projection of cartilage, opposite the first curve of the helix (process of the helix). Another fissure, the fissure of the tragus, is seen upon the anterior surface of the tragus. The antihelix is divided below, by a deep fissure, into two parts: one part terminates by a pointed, tail-like extremity [processus caudatus); the other is continuous with the antitragus. The cartilage of the pinna is very pliable, elastic, of a yellowish colour, and belongs to that form of cartilage which is known under the name of yellow fibro-cartilage. The ligaments of the pinna consist of two sets :—i. The extrinsic set, or those connecting it to the side of the head. 2. The intrinsic set, or those connecting the various parts of its cartilage together.OEGANS OF SENSE 858 The extrinsic ligaments, the most important, are two in number, anterior and posterior. The anterior ligament extends from the process of the helix to the root of the zygoma. A few fibres connect the tragus to the root of the zygoma. The posterior ligament passes from the posterior surface of the concha to the outer surface of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The intrinsic ligaments are also two in number. Of these, one is a strong fibrous band, stretching across from the tragus to the commencement of the helix, completing the meatus in front, and partly encircling the boundary of the concha; the other extends between the concha and the processus caudatus. The muscles of the phma (fig. 477) consist of two sets:—i. The extrinsic, which connect it with the side of the head, moving the pinna as a whole, viz. the Attollens, Attrahens, and Eetrahens aurem (page 370); and 2. the intrinsic, which extend from one part of the auricle to another, viz.— Helicis major. Antitragicus. Helicis minor. Transversus auriculae. Tragicus. Obliquus auris. The Musculus helicis major is a narrow vertical band of muscular fibres, situated upon the anterior margin of the helix. It arises, below, from the process of the helix, and is inserted into the anterior border of the helix, just where it is about to curve backwards. It is pretty constant in its existence. The Musculus helicis minor is an oblique fasciculus, attached to that part of the helix which commences from the bottom of the concha. The Tragicus is a short, flattened band of muscular fibres situated upon the outer surface of the tragus, the direction of its fibres being vertical. The Antitragicus arises from the outer part of the antitragus : its fibres are inserted into the processus caudatus of the helix. This muscle is usually very distinct. The Transversus auricitlce is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of radiating fibres, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the convexity of the concha to the prominence corresponding with the groove of the helix. The OhligiLUs auris (Todd) consists of a few fibres extending from the upper and back part of the concha to the convexity immediately above it. The arteries of the pinna are the posterior auricular from the external carotid, the anterior auricular from the temporal; and an auricular branch from the occipital artery. The veins accompany the corresponding arteries. The nerves are : the auricularis magnus, from the cervical plexus ; the posterior auricular, from the facial to the muscles of the pinna; the auricular branch of the pneumogastric ; the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve ; the occipitalis minor from the cervical plexus, and the occipitalis major or internal branch of the posterior division of the second cervical nerve. The Auditory Canal {^meatus auclitorius externus) (fig. 500) extends from the bottom of the concha to the membrana tympani. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, its direction is obliquely forwards and inwards, and it is slightly curved upon itself, so as to be higher in the middle than at either extremity. It forms an oval cylindrical canal, the greatest diameter being in the vertical direction at the external orifice, but in the transverse direction at the tympanic end. The calibre of the canal is narrowest about the middle. The membrana tympani, which occupies the termination of the meatus, is obliquely directed, in consequence of which the floor of the canal is longer than the roof, and the anterior wall longer than the posterior. The auditory canal is formed partly by cartilage and mem- brane, and partly by bone, and is covered by skin. The cartilaginous portion is about half an inch in length, being rather less than half the canal; it is formed by the cartilage of the concha and tragus, prolonged inwards, and firmly attached to the circumference of the auditory process of the859 THE AUDITORY CANAL temporal bone. The cartilage is deficient at its upper and back part, its place being supplied by fibrous membrane. This part of the canal is rendered extremely movable by two or three deep fissures {incisures, Santorini), which extend through the cartilage in a vertical direction. The osseous portion is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and narrower than the cartilaginous portion.. It is directed inwards and a little forwards, forming a slight curve in its course, the convexity of which is upwards and back- wards. Its inner end, which communicates, in the dry bone, with the cavity of the tympanum, is smaller than the outer and sloped, the anterior wall projecting beyond the posterior about two lines; it is marked, except at its upper part, by a narrow groove for the insertion of the membrana tympani. Its outer end is dilated, and rough, in the greater part of its circumference, for the attachment of the cartilage of the pinna. Its vertical transverse section is oval, the greatest diameter being from above downwards. The front and lower parts of this canal are formed by a curved plate of bone, which, in the foetus, exists as a separate ring (tympanic plate), incomplete at its upper part. Fig. 501.—A front view of the organ of hearing. Eight side. The shin lining the meatus is very thin, adheres closely to the cartilaginous and osseous portion of the tube, and covers the surface of the membrana tympani, forming its outer layer. After maceration, the thin pouch of epidermis, when withdrawn, preserves the form of the meatus. In the thick subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous part of the meatus are numerous ceruminous glands, which secrete the ear-wax. They resemble in structure sweat-glands, and their ducts open on the surface of the skin. The arteries supplying the meatus are branches from the posterior auricular, internal maxillary, and temporal. The nerves are chiefly derived from the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. Surf ace Form.—At the point of junction of the osseous and cartilaginous portions, the tube forms an obtuse angle, which projects into the tube at its antero-inferior wall. This produces a sort of constriction in this situation, and renders it the narrowest portion of the canal—an important point to be borne in mind in connection with the presence of foreign bodies in the ears. The cartilaginous is connected to the bony part by fibrous tissue, which renders the outer part of the tube very movable, and therefore by drawing the pinna upwards and backwards the canal is rendered almost straight. At the external orifice are a few shori, crisp hairs, which serve to prevent the entrance of small particles of dust, or flies or other insects. In the external auditory meatus the secretion of the ceru- minous glands serves to catch any small particles which may find their way into the canal, and prevent their reaching the membrana tympani, where their presence'might excite86o ORGANS OF SENSE irritation. In voimg children the meatus is very short, the osseous part being very deficient, and consisting'merely of a bony ring (the tymjmnicijlate), which supports the membrana tympani. In the foetus, the osseous part is entirely absent. The shortness of the canal in children should be borne in mind in introducing the aural speculum, so that it be not pushed in too far, at the risk of injuring the membrana tympani; indeed, even in the adult the speculum should never be introduced beyond the constriction which marks the junction of the osseous and cartilaginous portions. In using this instrument it is advisable that the pinna should be drawn upwards, backwards, and a little outwards, so as to render the canal as straight as possible, and thus assist the operator in obtaining, by the aid of reflected light, a good view of the membrana tympani. Just in front of the membrane is a well-marked depression, situated on the floor of the canal, and bounded by a somewhat prominent ridge ; in this foreign bodies may become lodged. By aid of the speculum, combined with traction of the auricle upwards and backwards, the whole of the membrana tympani is rendered visible. It is a pearly-grey membrane, slightly glistening in the adult, placed obliquely, so as to form with the floor of the meatus a very acute angle, while with the roof it forms an obtuse angle. At birth it is more horizontal, situated in almost the same plane as the base of the skull. About midway between the anterior and posterior margins of the membrane, and extending from the centre obliquely upwards, is a reddish- yellow streak ; this is the handle of the malleus, which is inserted into the membrane. At the upper part of this streak, close to the roof of the meatus, a little white, rounded prominence is plainly to be seen; this is the processus brevis of the malleus, projecting against the membrane. The membrana tympani does not present a plane surface ; on the contrary, its centre is drawn inwards, on account of its connection with the handle of the malleus, and thus the external surface is rendered concave. Middle Ear, ok Tympanum The middle ear, or tympanum, is an irregular cavity, compressed from without inwards, and situated within the petrous bone. It is placed above the jugular fossa ; the carotid canal lying in front, the mastoid cells behind, the meatus auditorius externally, and the labyrinth internally. It is filled with air, and communicates with the pharynx by the Eustachian tube. The tympanum is traversed by a chain of movable bones, which connect the membrana tympani with the labyrinth, and serve to convey the vibrations communicated to the membrana tympani across the cavity of the tympanum to the internal ear. The cavity of the tympcmttm measures about five lines from before backwards, three lines in the vertical direction, and between two and three in the transverse, being a little broader behind and above than it is below and in front. It is bounded externally by the membrana tympani and meatus ; internally, by the outer surface of the internal ear ; and communicates, behind, with the mastoid cells ; and in front with the Eustachian tube and canal for the Tensor tympani. Its roof and floor are formed by thin osseous laminae, the one forming the roof being a thin plate situated on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, close to its angle of junction with the squamous portion of the same bone. The roof is broad, flattened, and formed of a thin plate of bone, which separates the cranial and tympanic cavities. The floor is narrow, and corresponds to the' jugular fossa, which lies beneath. It presents, near the inner wall, a small aperture for the passage of Jacobson's nerve. The outer wall is formed mainly by the membrana tympani, partly by the ring of bone into which this membrane is inserted. Close to it are three small apertures : the iter chordae posterius, the Glaserian fissure, and the iter chordae anterius. The aperture of the iter choreics iwsterius is in the angle of junction between the posterior and external walls of the tympanum, immediately behind the membrana tympani and on a level with its centre ; it leads into a minute canal, which descends in front of the aqueductus Fallopii, and terminates in that canal near the stylo- mastoid foramen. Through it the chorda tympani nerve enters the tympanum. | The Glaserian fissure opens just above and in front of the ring of bone into which the membrana tympani is inserted; in this situation it is a mere slit about a line in length. It lodges the long process of the malleus, and gives passage to some tympanic vessels. The aperture of the iter cliordce anterius is seen just above the preceding fissure ;86i THE TYMPANUM it leads into a canal {canal of Huguier)., which runs parallel with the Glaserian fissure. Through it the chorda tympani nerve leaves the tympanum. The internal wall of the tympanum (fig. 502) is vertical in direction, and looks directly outwards. It presents for examination the following parts :— Fenestra ovalis. Ridge of the aqueductus Fallopii. Fenestra rotunda. Pyramid. Promontory. Opening for the Stapedius. The fenestra ovalis is a reniform opening, leading from the tympanum into the vestibule; its long diameter is directed horizontally, and its convex border is upwards. The opening in the recent state is occupied by the base of the stapes, which is connected to the margin of the foramen by an annular ligament. The fenestra rotunda is an aperture placed at the bottom of a funnel-shaped depression leading into the cochlea. It is situated below and rather behind the fenestra ovalis, from which it is separated by a rounded elevation, the promontory ; it is closed in the recent state by a membrane [memhrana tympani secundaria, Scarpa). This membrane is concave towards the tympanum, convex towards the Fig, 502.—View of inner wall of tympanum. (Enlarged.) cochlea. It consists of three layers : the external, or mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum ; the internal, or serous, from the lining membrane of the cochlea ; and an intermediate, or fibrous layer. The promontory is a rounded hollow prominence, formed by the projection outwards of the first turn of the cochlea ; it is placed between the fenestrae, and is furrowed on its surface by three small grooves, which lodge branches of the tympanic plexus. The rounded eminence of the aqueductus Fallopii, the prominence of the bony canal in which the portio dura is contained, traverses the inner wall of the tym- panum above the fenestra ovalis, and behind that opening curves nearly vertically downwards along the posterior wall. The pyramid is a conical eminence, situated immediately behind the fenestra ovalis, and in front of the vertical portion of the eminence above described ; it is hollow in the interior, and contains the Stapedius muscle ; its summit projects forwards towards the fenestra ovalis, and presents a small aperture, which transmits the tendon of the muscle. The cavity in the pyramid is prolonged into a minute canal, which communicates with the aqueductus Fallopii, and transmits the nerve which supplies the Stapedius. The posterior wall of the tympanum is wider above than below, and presents for examination the Openings of the mastoid cells. These consist of one large irregular aperture, and several smaller openings,OEGANS OF SENSE 862 situated at the upper part of the posterior wall ; they lead into canals, which communicate with large irregular cavities contained in the interior of the mas- toid process. These cavities vary considerably in number, size, and form ; they are lined by mucous membrane, continuous with that lining the caA'ity of the tympanum. The anterior wall of the tympanum is wider above than below ; it corresponds with the carotid canal, from which it is separated by a thin plate of bone, perforated by the tympanic branch of the internal carotid. It presents for examination the Canal for the Tensor tympani. Orifice of the Eustachian tube. The processus cochleariformis. The orifice of the canal for the Tensor tympani and the orifice of the Eustachian tube are situated at the upper part of the anterior wall, being separated from each other by a thin, delicate, horizontal plate of bone, the processus cochleariformis. These canals run from the tympanum forwards, inwards, and a little downwards, to the retiring angle between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone. The canal for the Tensor tympani is the superior and the smaller of the two ; it is rounded, and lies beneath the upper surface of the petrous bone, close to the hiatus Fallopii. The tympanic end of this canal forms a conical eminence, which is prolonged backwards into the cavity of the tympanum, and is perforated at its summit by an aperture, which transmits the tendon of the muscle contained in it. This eminence is sometimes called the anterior pyramid. The canal contains the Tensor tympani muscle. The Eustachian tube is the channel through which the tympanum communi- cates with the pharynx. Its length is from an inch and a half to two inches, and its direction downwards, forwards, and inwards. It is formed partly of bone, partly of cartilage and fibrous tissue. The osseous portion is about half an inch in length. It commences in the lower part of the anterior wall of the tympanum, below the processus cochleari- formis, and, gradually narrowing, terminates in an oval dilated opening, at the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions, its extremity presenting a jagged margin which serves for the attachment of the cartilaginous portion. The cartilaginous 'portion, about an inch in length, is formed of a triangular plate of elastic fibro-cartilage, curled upon itself, an interval being left below, between the margins of the cartilage, which is completed by fibrous and muscular tissue. Its canal is narrow behind, wide, expanded, and som.ewhat trumpet-shaped in front, terminating by an oval orifice, at the upper part and side of the pharynx, behind the back part of the inferior meatus. Through this canal the mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with that which lines the tympanum. The mucous membrane is covered with ciliated epithelium. The membrana tympani separates the cavity of the tympanum from the bottom of the external meatus. It is a thin, semi-transparent membrane, nearly oval in form, somewhat broader above than below, and directed very obliquely downwards and inwards. Its circumference is contained in a groove at the inner end of the meatus, which skirts the circumference of this part, excepting above. The handle of the malleus descends vertically between the inner and middle layers of this membrane as far down as its centre, where it is firmly attached, drawing the membrane inwards, so that its outer surface is concave, its inner convex. Structure.—This membrane is composed of three layers, an external (cuticular), a middle (fibrous), and an internal (mucous). cuticular lining is derived from the integument lining the meatus. ThQ fibrous layer consists of fibrous and elastic tissues ; some of the fibres radiate from near the centre to the circumference ; others are arranged, in the form of a dense circular ring, round the attached margin of the membrane. The mucous lining is derived from the mucous lining of the tympanum. The vessels pass to the membrana tympani along the handle of the malleus, and are distributed between its layers.THE TYMPANUM 863 Ossicles of the Tympanum (fig. 503) The tympanum is traversed by a chain of movable bones, three in number, the malleus, incus, and stapes. The former is attached to the membrana tympani, the latter to the fenestra ovalis, the incus being placed between the two, to both of which it is connected by delicate articulations. The Malleus, so named from its fancied resemblance to a hammer, consists of a head, neck, and three processes : the handle or manubrium, the processus gracilis, and the processus brevis. The head is the large upper extremity of the bone ; it is oval in shape, and articulates posteriorly with the incus, being free in the rest of its extent. The neck is the narrow contracted part just beneath the head ; and below this is a prominence, to which the various processes are attached. The mamibrium is a vertical process of bone, which is connected by its outer margin with the membrana tympani. It decreases in size towards its extremity, where it is curved slightly forwards, and flattened from within outwards. On the inner side, near its upper end, is a slight projection, into which the tendon of the Tensor tympani is inserted. The processus gracilis is a long and very delicate process, which passes from the eminence below the neck forwards and outwards to the Glaserian fissure, to which it is connected by bone and ligamentous fibres. The processus brevis is a slight conical projection, which springs from the root of the manubrium, and lies in contact with the membrana tympani. The Incus has received its name from its supposed resemblance to an anvil, but it is more like a bicuspid tooth, with two roots, which differ in length, and are widely separated from each other. It consists of a body and two processes. The body is somewhat quadrilateral but compressed laterally. On the anterior surface of its summit is a deeply concavo-convex facet, which articulates with the malleus ; in the fresh state it is covered with cartilage and lined with synovial mem- ^^^^^ 503.-The small bones of the ear, brane. seen from the outside. (Enlarged.) The two processes diverge from one another nearly at right angles. The short process, somewhat conical in shape, projects nearly horizontally back- J^y^, 'X-'^Z^ Processus brevis wards, and is attached to the margin of the opening leading into the mastoid cells, by ligamentous fibres. The long process, longer and more stapes\ slender than the preceding, descends nearly vertically behind and parallel to the handle of the malleus, and, bending inwards, ter- minates in a rounded globular projection, the OS orbiculare, or lenticular process which is tipped with cartilage, and arti- culates with the head of the stapes. In the foetus the os orbiculare exists as a separate bone, but becomes united to the long process of the incus in the adult. The Stapes, so called from its close resemblance to a stirrup, consists of a head, neck, two branches, and a base. The head presents a depression, tipped with cartilage, which articulates with the OS orbiculare. The neck, the constricted part of the bone below the head, receives the insertion of the Stapedius muscle. The two branches [crura) diverge from the neck, and are connected at their extremities by a-, flattened, oval-shaped plate (the base), which forms the foot of the stirrup, and is fixed to the margin of the fenestra ovalis by ligamentous fibres. Ligaments of the Ossicula.—These small bones are connected with each other, Os orbiculare Head Crura864 ORGANS OF SENSE and with the walls of the tympanum, by ligaments, and moved by small muscles. The articular surfaces of the malleus and incus, and the orbicular process of the incus and head of the stapes, are covered with cartilage, connected together by delicate capsular ligaments, and lined by synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting the ossicula with the walls of the tympanum are four in number : two for the malleus, one for the incus, and one for the stapes. The anterior ligament of the malleus was formerly described by Sommerring as a muscle (Laxator tympani). It is now, however, believed by most observers to consist of ligamentous fibres only. It is attached by one extremity to the neck of the malleus, just above the processus gracilis, and by the other to the anterior wall of the tympanum, close to the Glaserian fissure, some of its fibres being prolonged through the fissure. The suspensory ligament of the malleus is a delicate, round bundle of fibres which descends perpendicularly from the roof of the tympanum to the head of the malleus. The posterior ligament of the incus is a short, thick, ligamentous band which connects the extremity of the short process of the incus to the posterior wall of the tympanum, near the margin of the opening of the mastoid cells. The annular ligament of the stayes connects the circumference of the base of this bone to the margin of the fenestra oralis. A suspensory ligament of the incus has been described by Arnold, descending from the roof of the tympanum to the upper part of the incus, near its articulation with the malleus. The muscles of the tympanum are two :— Tensor tympani. Stapedius. The Tensor tympani, the larger, 'is contained in the bony canal, above the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube, from which it is separated by the processus cochleariformis. It arises from the under surface of the petrous bone, from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, and from the osseous canal in which it is contained. Passing backwards through the canal, it terminates in a slender tendon which enters the tympanum and makes a sharp bend outward round the extremity of the processus cochleariformis, and is inserted into the handle of the malleus, near its root. It is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion. The Stapedius arises from the side of a conical cavity, hollowed out of the interior of the pyramid; its tendon emerges from the orifice at the apex of the pyramid, and, passing forwards, is inserted into the neck of the stapes. Its surface is aponeurotic, its interior fleshy; and its tendon occasionally contains a slender bony spine, which is constant in some mammalia. It is supplied by the tympanic branch of the facial nerve. Actions.—The Tensor tympani draws the membrana tympani inwards, and thus heightens its tension. The Stapedius draws the head of the stapes backwards, and thus causes the base of the bone to rotate on a vertical axis drawn through its own centre: in doing this the back part of the base would be pressed inwards towards the vestibule, while the fore part would be drawn from it. It probably compresses the contents of the vestibule. The mucous membrane of the tympanum is thin, slightly vascular, and continuous with the mucous membrane of the pharynx, through the Eustachian tube. It invests the ossicula, and the muscles and nerves contained in the tympanic cavity; forms the internal layer of the membrana tympani; covers the foramen rotundum, and is reflected into the mastoid cells, which it lines throughout. In the tympanum and mastoid cells this membrane is pale, thin, slightly vascular, and covered with ciliated epithelium. In the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube the membrane is thin; but in the cartilaginous portion it is very thick, highly vascular, covered Avith laminar ciliated epithelium, and provided with numerous mucous glands. The arteries supplying the tympanum are six in number. Three of them are larger than the rest, viz. the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, which865 INTEENAL EAE supplies the membrana tympani; the Vidian, and the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular, which supplies the back part of the tympanum and mastoid cells. The smaller branches are—the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal, which enters through the hiatus Fallopii; a branch from the ascending pharyngeal and another from the Vidian which pass up the Eustachian tube ; and the tympanic branch from the internal carotid, given oE in the carotid canal and perforating the thin anterior wall of the tympanum. The veins of the tympanum terminate in the temporo-maxillary vein and in the superior petrosal sinus. The nerves of the tympanum may be divided into—i. Those supplying the muscles ; 2. those distributed to the lining membrane ; 3. branches communicating with other nerves. Nerves to nmscles.—The Tensor tympani is supplied by a branch from the otic ganglion ; the Stapedius by the tympanic branch of the facial (Sommerring). The nerves distributed to the lining membrane are derived from the tympanic plexus. The communications which take place in the tympanum are between the tympanic branch of the giosso-pharyngeal with the sympathetic and with filaments derived from the intumescentia ganglioformis of the facial. The tyiJipanic branch of the glosso-ijharyngeal (Jacobson's nerve) enters the tympanum by an aperture in its floor, close to the inner wall, and divides into branches, which are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory forming the tympanic plexus. Its branches of distribution are, one to the fenestra rotunda, one to the fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the tympanum and Eustachian tube. Its branches of communication are three, and occupy separate grooves on the surface of the promontory. One branch, the small deep petrosal, arches forwards and downwards to the carotid canal to join the carotid plexus. A second, the long petrosal nerve, runs forwards through a canal close to or in the processus cochleari- formis, and enters the foramen lacerum medium, where it joins the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and generally the large superficial petrosal nerve. The third branch runs upwards through the substance of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In its course it passes by the gangliform enlargement of the facial nerve, and, receiving a connecting filament from it, becomes the small superficial petrosal nerve. It then enters the skull through a small aperture, situated external to the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior surface of the petrous bone ; courses forwards across the base of the skull, and emerges through a foramen in the middle fossa (sometimes through the foramen ovale), and joins the otic ganglion. The chorda tympani is given off from the facial, as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of the tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It passes from below upwards and forwards in a distinct canal, and enters the cavity of the tympanum through an aperture, iter chordcB poster ins, on its posterior wall between the opening of the mastoid cells and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner end of the Glaserian fissure, which is called the iter chordae anterius, or canal of Huguier. Internal Eae, or Labyrinth The internal ear is the essential part of the organ, receiving the ultimate distribution of the auditory nerve. It is called the labyrinth, from the complexity of its shape, and consists of three parts : the vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea. It is formed by a series of cavities, channelled out of the substance of the petrous bone, communicating externally with the cavity of the tympanum through the fenestra ovalis and rotunda ; and internally with the meatus auditorius internus, 3K866 OBGANS OF SENSE which contains the auditory nerve. Within the osseous labyrinth is contained the membranous labyrinth, upon which the ramifications of the auditory nerve are distributed. The Vestibule (fig. 504) is the common central cavity of communication between the parts of the internal ear. It is situated on the inner side of the tympanum, behind the cochlea, and in front of the semicircular canals. It is somewhat ovoidal in shape from before backwards, flattened from within outwards, and measures about one-fifth of an inch from before backwards, as well as from above downwards, being narrower from without inwards. On its outer or tympanic ivall is the fenestra ovalis, closed, in the recent state, by the base of the stapes, and its annular ligament. On its innei- ivall, at the fore part, is a small circular depression, fovea hemispJierica, which is perforated, at its anterior and inferior part, by several minute holes {macula crihrosa) for the passage of the filaments of the auditory nerve ; and behind this depression is a vertical ridge, the i^yramidal eminence {crista vestihuli). At the hinder part of the inner wall is the orifice of the aque- ductus vestihuli, which extends to the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It transmits a small vein, and, according to some, contains a Fig. 504.—The osseous labyrinth laid open. (Enlarged.) tubular prolongation of the lining membrane of the vestibule, which ends in a cul-de-sac between the layers of the dura mater within the cranial cavity. On the 'upjjer wall or roof is a transversely oval depression, fovea semi-elliptica, separated from the fovea hemispherica by the pyramidal eminence already mentioned. Behind, the semicircular canals open into the vestibule by five orifices. In front is a large oval opening, which communicates with the scala vestibuli of the cochlea by a single orifice, apertura scalcB vestibuli cochlecB. The Semicircular canals are three bony canals, situated above and behind the vestibule. They are of unequal length, compressed from side to side, and describe the greater part of a circle. They measure about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, and each presents a dilatation at one end, called the ampulla, which measures more than twice the diameter of the tube. These canals open into the vestibule by five orifices, one of the apertures being common to two of the canals. The superior semicircular canal is vertical in direction, and stretches across the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at right angles to its posterior surface; its arch forms a round projection on the anterior surface of the petrous bone. It describes about two-thirds of a circle. Its outer extremity, Avhich is ampullated, commences by a distinct orifice in the upper part of the vestibule ; the opposite end867 COCHLEA of the canal, which is not dilated, joins with the corresponding part of the posterior canal, and opens by a common orifice with it in the back part of the vestibule. The posterior semicircular canal, also vertical in direction, is directed back- wards, nearly parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous bone ; it is the longest af the three, its ampullated end commences at the lower and back part of the vestibule, its opposite end joining to form the common canal already mentioned. The external or horizontal canal is the shortest of the three, its arch being directed outwards and backwards; thus each semicircular canal stands at right angles to the other two. Its ampullated end corresponds to the upper and outer angle of the vestibule, just above the fenestra ovalis ; its opposite end opens by a distinct orifice at the upper and back part of the vestibule. The Cochlea bears some resemblance to a common snail-shell: it forms the anterior part of the labyrinth, is conical in form, and placed almost horizontally in front of the vestibule ; its apex is directed forwards and outwards towards the upper and front part of the inner wall of the tympanum ; its base corresponds with the anterior depression at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, and is perforated by numerous apertures, for the passage of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve. It measures about a quarter of an inch in length, and its breadth towards the base is about the same. It consists of a conical-shaped central axis, the modiolus or columella; of a canal wound spirally round the axis for two turns and a half, from the base to the apex ; and of a delicate lamina (the lamina spiralis) contained within the canal, which follows its windings, and partially subdivides it into two. The central axis, or modiolus, is conical in form, and extends from the base to the apex of the cochlea. Its base is broad, corresponds with the first turn of the cochlea, and is perforated by numerous orifices, which transmit filaments of the cochlear branch of the auditory nerve; the axis diminishes rapidly in size in the second coil, and terminates within the last half-coil, or cupola, in an expanded delicate, bony lamella, which resembles the half of a funnel, divided longitudinally, and is called the infundihulum ; the broad part of this funnel is directed towards the summit of the cochlea, and blends with the cupola or last half-turn of the spiral canal of the cochlea. At this point the two larger scalse of the cochlea, the scala tympani and scala vestibuli, communicate by an opening called the helico- trema. The outer surface of the modiolus forms part of the wall of the spiral canal, and is dense in structure ; but its centre is channelled, as far as the last half-coil, by numerous branching canals, which transmit nervous filaments in regular succession into the canal of the cochlea, or on to the surface of the lamina spiralis. One of these, larger than the rest, occupies the centre of the modiolus, and is named the canalis centralis modioli; it extends "from the base to the extremity of the modiolus, and transmits a small nerve and artery {arteria centralis modioli). The spiral canal (fig. 505) takes two turns and a half round the modiolus. It is about an inch and a half in length, measured along its outer wall; and diminishes gradually in size from the base to the summit, where it terminates in a cul-de-sac, the cupola, which forms the apex of the cochlea. The commencement of this canal is about the tenth of an inch in diameter; it diverges from the modiolus towards the tympanum and vestibule, and presents three openings. One, the fenestra rotunda, communicates with the tympanum ; in the recent state this aperture is closed by a membrane, the memhrana tympani secundaria. Another aperture, of an oval form, enters the vestibule. The third is the aperture of the aqueductus cochlecB, leading to a minute funnel-shaped canal, which opens on the basilar surface of the petrous bone, and transmits a small vein. The interior of the spiral canal (fig. 506) is partially divided into two, in the dry state, by a thin bony plate, the lamina spiralis, which consists of two thin lamella of bone, between which are numerous canals for the passage of nerve- fibres. This lamina projects from the modiolus into the canal, but does not reach more than half-way towards the outer wall of the tube. From its extremity a thin membrane extends to the outer wall, and completes the division of the canal into 3 K 2868 ORGANS OF SENSE an upper compartment, the scala vestihuli, and a lower one, the scala tymi)ani. By a second membrane a portion of the upper of these two canals is cut off from the rest, constituting the scala media. The lamina spiralis ends above in a hook- shaped process, which partly bounds the helicotrema. At the point where the osseous lamina is attached to the modiolus is a small canal, which winds round the modiolus, and was denominated by Rosenthal the caiialis spiralis modioli; it is occupied by a swelling of the cochlear nerve, the ganglion spirale, in which Fig. 505.—The cochlea laid open. (Enlarged.) ganglion-cells are found, and from which the nerves pass to the osseous lamina and organ of Corti. The osseous lamina, as above stated, extends only part of the distance between the modiolus and the outer bony wall of the cochlea. Near its outer end the periosteum on the upper or vestibular surface of the lamina swells up into an elevation which is called the limbus lamincB spiralis (' denticulate lamina ' of Todd and Bowman). The lamina spiralis terminates in a grooved extremity, the sulcus Fig. 506.—Longitudinal section of the cochlea, showing the relations of the scalse, the ganglion spirale, etc. S. V. Scala vestibuli. S. T. Scala tympani. S. M. Scala media. L. S. Ligamentnm spirale. G. S. Ganglion spirale. spiralis, which presents the form of the letter C : the upper part of the letter, being formed by the overhanging extremity of the limbus, is named the labium vestibulare; the lower part, prolonged and tapering, is called the labium tympani- cum (fig. 507). From the labium tympanicum a thin membrane extends over to the bony wall of the cochlea, completing the scala tympani. This membrane is called the viembrana basilar is. At its outer attachment it swells out so as to form a thick triangular structure, which was regarded as a muscle by Todd and Bowman869 COCHLEA (cochlearis), but is now recognised as ligamentous—the ligamentum sjnTale. Between the labium vestibulare and the attachment of the membrane of Reissner, presently to be described, a very delicate membrane extends over to the outer wall of the cochlea, running nearly parallel to the membrana basilaris. It was described by Corti, and covers over the organ which is called after his name, and is therefore called membrane of Corti or membrana tectoria. Farther inwards, near the commencement of the limbus laminfe spiralis, another delicate membrane, the membrane of Beissner, is attached to the vestibular surface of the periosteum of the osseous lamina, and stretches across to the outer wall of the cochlea. The canal which lies below the osseous lamina and membrana basilaris is the scala tympani ; that which is bounded by the osseous lamina and membrane of Reissner the scala vestibuli; while the space between the membrane of Reissner and membrana basilaris is generally described as the Scala media, Canalis membranacea, or Canalis cochlece, and this is the nomenclature which will be used here. Others, however, apply the name canalis cocMece only to the canal lying between the membrane of Reissner and the membrana tectoria, which contains no object for description, while the space lying between the membrana tectoria and membrana basilaris is described by itself as a fourth canal—the ductus cochlearis or ditctits auditorius* The latter is the space in which the organ of Corti f is contained. This organ Fig. 507.—Floor of scala media, showing the organ of Corti, etc. (fig. 507) is situated upon the membrana basilaris, and appears at first sight as a papilla, winding spirally with the turns of this membrane throughout the whole length of the cochlea, from which circumstance it has been designated the papilla spiralis. More accurately viewed, it is seen to be composed of a remarkable arrange- ment of cells, which may be likened to the keyboard of a pianoforte. Of these cells, the two central ones are rodlike bodies, and are called the inner and outer rods of Corti. They are placed erect on the basilar membrane, at some little distance from each other, the space between them being denominated the zo7ia arcuata; they are inclined towards each other, so as to meet at their opposite extremities, and form a series of arches roofing over the zona arcuata, thus forming a minute tunnel between them and the basilar membrane, which ascends spirally through the whole length of the cochlea. They are estimated at over three thousand in number. The inner rods, which are more numerous than the outer ones, rest on the basilar membrane, close to the labium tympanicum ; they project obliquely forwards and outwards, and terminate above in expanded extremities, which resemble in shape the upper end of the ulna, with its sigmoid cavity, coronoid and olecranon * In reading the older descriptions of the organ of hearing, the student must bear in mind that the membranes bounding the ductus auditorius, together with the organ contained between them, were described together as the 'lamina spiralis membranacea,' while the membrane of Reissner was not reeognised, the parts being, in fact, as shown in the second turn of the cochlea on the right hand of fig. 506. t Corti's original paper is in the Zeitschr ftf. Wissen. Zool. iii. 109.ORGANS OF SENSE processes. On the outer side of the rod, in the angle formed between it and the basilar membrane, is a protoplasmic cell; whilst on the inner side is a row of epithelial cells, surmounted by a brush of fine, stiff, hairlike processes, these cells being continuous with the cubical cells lining the sulcus spiralis. The outer rods also rest by a broad foot on the basilar membrane ; they incline forwards and inAvards, and their upper extremity resembles the head and bill of a swan ; the head fitting into the concavity—the analogue of the sigmoid cavity—of one or more of the internal rods, and the bill resting against the phalanges of the lamina reticularis, presently to be described. In the head of these outer rods is an oval portion, where the fibres of which the rod appears to be composed are deficient, and which stains more deeply with carmine than the rest of the rod. This is supposed to represent the nucleus of the cell from which the rod was originally developed. At the base of the rod, on its internal side—^that is to say, in the angle formed by the rod with the basilar membrane—is a similar protoplasmic cell to that found on the outer side of the base of the inner rod ; whilst external to the outer rod are three or four successive rows of epithelial cells, more elongated than those found on the internal side of the inner rod, but, like them, furnished with minute hairs or cilia. These are termed the outer liair-cells, in contradistinction to the inner set, which are termed the inner hair-cells. They are attached by their bases to the basilar membrane, whilst from the opposite extremity a brush of hairs or cilia projects through the reticular membrane. They are continuous externally with the cubical cells on the lateral part of the basilar membrane. The reticular lamina or memhrcme of KolUker is a delicate framework perforated by rounded holes. It extends from the inner rods of Corti to the external row of the outer hair-cells, and is formed by several rows of ' minute fiddle-shaped cuticular structures,' called phalanges, between which are holes for the projection of the ciliffi of the outer hair-cells. Covering over these structures, but not touching them, is the membrana tectoria, or membrane of Corti, which is attached to the vestibular surface of the lamina spiralis close to the attachment of the membrane of Reissner; it courses over the denticulate lamina, and, passing outwards parallel to the basilar membrane, is blended with the ligamentum spirale on the outer wall of the spiral canal.* The i)iner surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by an exceedingly thin fibro- serous membrane, analogous to a periosteum, from its close adhesion to the inner surfaces of these cavities, and performing the office of a serous membrane by its free surface. It lines the vestibule, and from this cavity is continued into the semi- circular canals and the scala vestibuli of the cochlea, and through the helicotrema into the scala tympani. A delicate tubular process is prolonged along the aqueduct of the vestibule to the inner surface of the dura mater. This membrane is continued across the fenestra ovalis and rotunda, and consequently has no communication with the lining membrane of the tympanum. Its attached surface is rough and fibrous, and closely adherent to the bone ; its free surface is smooth and pale, covered with a layer of epithelium, and secretes a thin, limpid fluid, the aqua lahyi inthi, liquor Cotunnii, ox perilym2)h (Blainville). The scala media is closed above and below. The upper blind extremity is attached to the cupola at the upper part of the helicotrema ; the lower end fits into the angle at the commencement of the osseous lamina on the floor of the vestibule. Near this blind extremity, the scala media receives the canalis reuniens (fig. 508), a very delicate canal, by which the ductus cochlearis is brought into continuity with the saccule. The Membranous Labyrinth The membranous labyrinth (fig. 508) is a closed membranous sac, containing fluid, on the walls of which the ramifications of the auditory nerve are distributed. It has the same general form as the vestibule and semicircular canals in which it * In fig. 507 only the inner half of the membrane is represented.871 MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH is enclosed and to which it is limited; but is considerably smaller, and separated from their lining membrane by the perilymph. The vestibular 'portion consists of two sacs, the utricle and the saccule. The utricle is the larger of the two, ol an oblong form, compressed laterally, and occupies the upper and back part of the vestibule, lying in contact with the fovea semi-elliptica. Numerous filaments of the auditory nerve are distributed on the wall of this sac ; and its cavity communicates behind with the membranous semicircular canals by five orifices. The saccule is the smaller of the two vestibular sacs ; it is globular in form, lies ill the fovea hemispherica, near the opening of the vestibular scala of the cochlea, and receives numerous nervous filaments, which enter from the bottom of the depression in which it is contained. Its cavity is apparently distinct from that of the utricle. The membranous semicircular canals are about one-third the diameter of the osseous canals, but in number, shape, and general form they are precisely similar ; they are hollow, and open by five orifices into the utricle, one opening being Fig. 508.—The membranous labyrinth. (Enlarged.) common to two canals. Their ampullae are thicker than the rest of the tubes, and nearly fill the cavities in which they are contained. The membranous labyrinth is held in its position by numerous fibrous bands which stretch across the space between the membranous and bony labyrinths. These fibrous bands convey the blood-vessels and nervous filaments distributed to the utricle, to the saccule, and to the ampulla of each canal. The nerves enter the vestibule through the minute apertures on its inner wall. Structure.—The wall of the membranous labyrinth is semi-transparent, and consists of three layers. The cuter layer is a loose and flocculent structure, apparently composed of ordinary fibrous tissue, containing blood-vessels and numerous pigment-cells analogous to those in the pigment-coat of the retina. The middle layer, thicker and more transparent, bears some resemblance to the hyaloid membrane, but it presents on its internal surface numerous papilliform projections^ and on the addition of acetic acid presents an appearance of longitudinal fibrillation and elongated nuclei. The inner layer is formed of polygonal nucleated epithelial cells, which secrete the endolymph. The endolymph (liquor Scarpce) is a limpid serous fluid, which fills the membranous labyrinth ; in composition it closely resembles the perilymph. The otoliths are two small rounded bodies, consisting of a mass of minute crystalline grains of carbonate of lime, held together in a mesh of delicate fibrous tissue, and contained in the walls of the utricle and saccule, opposite the distribu- tion of the nerves. A calcareous material is also, according to Bowman, sparingly scattered in the cells lining the ampulla of each semicircular canal.oeCtAns of sense 872 The arteries of the labyrinth are, the internal auditory, from the basilar; the stylo-mastoicl, from the posterior auricular ; and, occasionally, branches from the occipital. The internal auditory divides at the bottom of the internal meatus into two branches : cochlear and vestibular. The cochlear branch subdivides into from twelve to fourteen twigs, which traverse the canals in the modiolus, and are distributed, in the form of a capillary network, in the substance of the lamina spiralis. The vestibular branches accompany the nerves, and are distributed, in the form of a minute capillary network, in the substance of the membranous labyrinth. The veins (auditory) of the vestibule and semicircular canals accompany the arteries, and, receiving those of the cochlea at the base of the modiolus, terminate in the superior petrosal sinus. The auditory nerve, the special nerve of the sense of hearing, divides, at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, into two branches, the cochlear and vestibular. The trunk of the nerve, as well as the branches, contains numerous ganglion-cells with caudate prolongations. The vestibular nerve, the posterior of the two, divides into three branches : superior, middle, and inferior. The superior vestibular branch, the largest, divides into numerous filaments, which pass through minute openings at the upper and back part of the cul-de-sac at the bottom of the meatus, and, entering the vestibule, are distributed to the utricle and to the ampulla of the external and superior semicircular canals. The middle vestibular branch consists of numerous filaments, which enter the vestibule by a smaller cluster of foramina, placed below those above-mentioned, and which correspond to the bottom of the fovea hemispherica ; they are distributed to the saccule. The inferior and smallest branch passes backwards in a canal behind the foramina for the nerves of the saccule, and is distributed to the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal. The nervous filaments enter the ampullary enlargements at a deep depression seen on their external surface, with a corresponding elevation when seen from within ; the nerve-fibres ending in loops and in free extremities. In the utricle and saccule the nerve-fibres spread out, some blending with the calcareous matter; others, radiating on the inner surface of the wall of each cavity, become blended with a layer of nucleated cells, and terminate in a thin fibrous film. The cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments at the base of the modiolus, which ascend along its canals, and then, bending outwards at right angles, pass between the plates of the bony lamina spiralis, close to its tympanic surface. Between the plates of the spiral lamina the nerves form a plexus, which contains ganglion cells forming the ganglion spirale. From this ganglion delicate filaments pass between the layers of the osseous lamina to the sulcus spiralis and pass outwards to the organ of Corti. Their exact termination is uncertain. Waldeyer describes them as collected into two groups, one group ending in the outer and the other in the inner hair-cells. Surgical Anatomy.—Malformations, such as imperfect development of the external parts, absence of the meatus, or supernumerary auricles, are occasionally met with. Or the pinna may present a congenital fistula, which is due to defective closure of the first visceral cleft, or rather of that portion of it which is not concerned in the formation of the Eustachian tube, tympanum, and meatus. The skin of the am-icle is thin and richly supplied with blood, but in spite of this it is frequently the seat of frost-bite, due to the fact that it is much exposed to cold, and lacks the usual covering of subcutaneous fat found in most other parts of the body. A collection of blood is sometimes found between the cartilage and perichondrium {hcEmatoma auris), usually the result of traumatism, but not necessarily due to this cause. It is said to occur most frequently in the ears of the insane. Keloid sometimes grows in the auricle around the puncture made for earrings, and epithelioma occasionally affects this part. Deposits of urate of soda are often met with in the pinna in gouty subjects. The external auditory meatus can be most satisfactorily examined by light reflected down a funnel-shaped speculum; by gently moving the latter in different directions the873 SURGICAL ANATOMY whole of the canal and membrana tympani can be brought into view. The points to be noted are, the presence of wax or foreign bodies ; the size of the canal; and the condition of the membrana tympani. The accumulation of wax is often the cause of deafness, and may give rise to very serious consequences, causing ulceration of the membrane and even absorp- tion of the bony wall of the canal. Foreign bodies are not infrequently introduced into the ear by children, and, when situated in the first portion of the canal, may be removed with tolerable facility by means of a minute hook or loop of fine Avire, with reflected light; but when they have slipped beyond the narrow middle part of the meatus, their removal is in no wise easy, and attempts to effect it, in inexperienced hands, may be followed by destruction of the membrana tympani and possibly the contents of the tympanum. The calibre of the external auditory canal may be narrowed by inflammation of its lining membrane, running on to suppuration ; by periostitis; by polypi, sebaceous tumours, and exostoses. The membrana tympani, when seen in a healthy ear, ' reflects light strongly, and, owing to its peculiar curvature, presents a bright spot of triangular shape at its lower and anterior portion.' From the apex of this, proceeding upwards and slightly forwards, is a white streak formed by the handle of the malleus, while at the upper and middle part of the membrane may be seen a slight projection, caused by the short process of the malleus. In disease, alterations in colour, lustre, curvature or inclination, and perforation must be noted. Such perforations may be caused by a blow or a loud report or by a wound. The upper wall of the meatus is separated from the cranial cavity by a thin plate of bone; the anterior wall is separated from the temporo-maxillary joint and parotid gland by the bone forming the glenoid fossa ; and the posterior wall is in relation with the mastoid cells, hence inflammation of the external auditory meatus may readily extend to the membranes of the brain, to the temporo-maxillary joint, or to the mastoid cells ; and, in addition to this, blows on the chin may cause fracture of the wall of the meatus. The nerves supplying the meatus are, the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, the auriculo-temporal, and the auricularis magnus. The connections of these nerves explain the fact of the occurrence, in cases of any irritation of the meatus, of constant coughing and sneezing, from implication of the pneumogastric, or of yawning from implication of the auriculo-temporal. No doubt also the association of earache, with toothache, in cancer of the tongue is due to implication of the same nerve, a branch of the fifth, which supplies also the teeth and the tongue. The vessels of the meatus and membrana tympani are derived from the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary arteries. The upper half of the membrana tympani is much more richly supplied with blood than the lower half. For this reason, and also to avoid the chorda tympani nerve and ossicles, incisions through the membrane should be made at the lower and posterior part. The principal jDoint in connection with the surgical anatomy of the tympanum is its relations to other parts. Its roof is formed by a thin plate of bone, which, with the dura mater, is all that separates it from the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the brain. Its floor is immediately above the jugular fossa behind and the carotid canal in front. Its posterior wall presents the openings of the mastoid cells. On its anterior wall is the opening of the Eustachian tube. Thus it follows that in disease of the middle ear we may get subdural abscess, septic meningitis, or abscess of the cerebrum or cerebellum, from extension of the inflammation through the bony roof; thrombosis of the lateral sinus, with or without pyaemia, by extension through the floor; or mastoid abscess, by exten- sion backwards. In addition to this we may get fatal haemorrhage from the internal carotid in destructive changes of the middle ear. And in throat disease we may get the inflammation extending up the Eustachian tube to the middle ear. The Eustachian tube IS accessible from the nose. If the nose and mouth be' closed, and an attempt made to expire air, a sense of pressure with dulness of hearing is produced in both ears, from the air finding its way up the Eustachian tube and bulging out the membrana tympani. During the act of swallowing the pharyngeal orifice of the tube, which is normally closed, is opened, probably by the action of the Tensor tympani. This fact was employed by Politzer in devising an easy method of inflating the tube. The nozzle of an indiarubber syringe is inserted into the nostril; the patient takes a mouthful of water and holds it in his mouth; both nostrils are closed with the finger and thumb to prevent the escape of air, and the patient is then requested to swallow ; as he does so, the air is forced out of the syringe into his nose, and is driven into the Eustachian tube, which is now open. The impact of the air against the membrana tympani can be heard, if the membrane is sound, b}' means of a piece of indiarubber tubing, one end of which is inserted into the meatus of the patient's ear, the other into that of the surgeon. The direct examination of the Eustachian tube is made by the Eustachian catheter. This is passed along the floor of the nostril, with the curve downwards, to the posterior wall of the pharynx. When this is felt, the catheter is to be withdrawn about half an inch, and the point rotated outwards through a quarter of a circle and pushed again slightly backwards, when it will enter the orifice of the tube, and will be found to be caught, and air forced into the catheter will be heard impinging on the tympanic membrane, if the ear of the patient and surgeon are connected by an indiarubber tube.OEGANS OF DIGESTION THE Apparatus for the Digestion of the Food consists of the ahmentary canal and of certain accessory organs. The alimentary canal is a musculo-membranous tube, about thirty feet in length, extending from the mouth to the anus, and lined throughout its entire extent by mucous membrane. It has received different names in the various parts of its course : at its commencement, the mouth, we find provision made for the mechanical division of the food {mastication), and for its admixture with a fluid secreted by the salivary glands (insalivation) ; beyond this are the organs of deglutition, the pharynx and the oesophagus, which convey the food into that part of the alimentary canal (the stomach) in which the principal chemical changes occur, and in which the reduction and solution of the food take place ; in the small intestines, the nutritive principles of the food (the chyle) are separated, by its admixture with the bile and pancreatic fluid, from that portion which passes into the large intestine, most of which is expelled from the system.

The mouth {oral or buccal cavity) (fig. 509) is placed at the commencement of the alimentary canal; it is a nearly oval-shaped cavity, in which the mastication of the food takes place. It is bounded, in front, by the lips ; laterally, by the cheeks and the alveolar processes of the upper and lower jaws ; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongue and by the mucous membrane stretched between the under surface of that organ and the inner surface of the jaws, and by the teeth of the lower jaw; behind, by the soft palate and fauces. The mucous membrane lining the mouth is continuous with the integument at the free margin of the lips, and with the mucous lining of the fauces behind; it is of a rose-pink tinge during life, and very thick where it covers the hard parts bounding the cavity. It is covered by stratified epithelium. The lips are two fleshy folds which surround the orifice of the mouth, formed externally of integument and internally of mucous membrane, between which are^ found the Orbicularis oris muscle, the coronary vessels, some nerves, areolar tissue, and fat, and numerous small labial glands. The inner surface of each lip is con- nected in the middle line to the gum of the corresponding jaw by a fold of mucous875 THE CHEEKS AND GUMS membrane, the frcBnwn lahii superioris and inferioris—the former being the larger of the two. The labial glands are situated between the mucous membrane and the Orbicu- laris oris, round the orifice of the mouth. They are rounded in form, about the size of small peas, their ducts opening by small orifices upon the mucous membrane. In structure they resemble the salivary glands. The cheeks form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed externally of integument; internally of mucous membrane; and between the two of a muscular stratum, besides a large quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. The mucous membrane lining the cheek is reflected above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Fig. 509.—Sectional view of the nose, mouth, pharynx, etc. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of which presents the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The principal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator ; but numerous other muscles enter into its formation; viz. the Zygomatici, Risorius Santorini, and Platysma myoides. The buccal glands are placed between the mucous membrane and Buccinator muscle : they are similar in structure to the labial glands, but smaller. \ < Two or three of larger size than the rest are placed between the Masseter and Buccinator muscles ; their ducts open into the mouth opposite the last molar tooth. They are called molar glands. The gums are composed of a dense fibrous tissue, closely connected to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and surrounding the necks of the teeth. They are covered by smooth and vascular mucous membrane, which is remarkable forOEGANS OF DIGESTION 876 its limited sensibility. Around the necks of the teeth this membrane presents nmiierous fine papillae; and from this point it is reflected into the alveolus, where it is continuous with the periosteal membrane lining that cavity. The Teeth The human subject is provided with two sets of teeth, which make their appear- ance at different periods of life. The first set appear in childhood, and are called the temporary, deciduous, or milk teeth. The second set, which also appear at an early period, continue until old age, and are named permanent. The te7nporary teeth are twenty in number : four incisors, two canine, and four molars, in each jaw. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number : four incisors (two central and two lateral), two canines, four bicuspids, and six molars, in each jaw. General Characters.—YiS^ch. tooth consists of three portions : the croion, or body, projecting above the gum ; the root, or fang, entirely concealed within the alveolus ; and the neck, the constricted portion, between the other two. The roots of the teeth are firmly implanted within the alveoli; these depressions are lined with periosteum, which is reflected on to the tooth at the point of the fang, and covers it as far as the neck. At the margin of the alveolus, the periosteum becomes continuous with the fibrous structure of the gums. Permanent Teeth The incisors, or cutting teeth, are so named from their presenting a sharp cutting edge, adapted for biting the food. They are eight in number, and form the four front teeth in each jaw. The croion is directed vertically, and is wedgelike in form, being bevelled at the expense of its posterior surface, so as to terminate in a sharp horizontal cutting edge, which, before being subject to attrition, presents three small prominent points. It is convex, smooth, and highly polished in front ; concave behind, where it is frequently marked by slight longitudinal furrows. The neck is constricted. The fang is long, single, conical, transversely flattened, thicker before than behind, and slightly grooved on each side in the longitudinal direction. The incisors of the upper jatv are altogether larger and stronger than those of the lower jaw. They are directed obliquely downwards and forwards. The two central ones are larger than the two lateral, and their free edges are sharp and chisel-like, being bevelled at the expense of their posterior edge : the root is more rounded. The incisors of the loioer jaio are smaller than the upper : the two central ones are smaller than the two lateral, and are the smallest of all the incisor teeth. The canine teeth, (cuspidati) are four in number: two in the upper, and two in the lower jaw ; one being placed behind each lateral incisor. They are larger and stronger than the incisors, especially the root, which sinks deeply into the jaw, and causes a well-marked prominence upon its surface. The crown is large and conical, very convex in front, a little hollowed and uneven posteriorly, and tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which rises above the level of the other teeth. The root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors, conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each side. The upper canine teeth (vulgarly called eye-teeth) are] larger and longer than the two lower, and situated a little behind them. The loioer canine teeth are placed in front of the upper, so that their summits correspond to the interval between the upper canine tooth and the neighbouring incisors on each side. The bicuspid teeth (premolars, small, or false molars) are eight in number: 4877 THE TEETH four in each jaw, two being placed immediately behind each of the canine teeth. They are smaller and shorter than the canine. The croiv7i is compressed from without inwards, and surmounted by two pyra- midal eminences, or cusps, separated by a groove; hence their name, bicuspidate. The outer of these cusps is larger and more prominent than the inner. The neck is oval. The root is generally single, compressed, and presents a deep groove on each side, which indicates a tendency in the root to become double. The apex is generally bifid. The tqjper bicusjjids are larger, and present a greater tendency to the division of their roots than the lower ; this is especially marked in the second upper bicuspid. The molar teeth {muUicuspidati, true or large molars) are the largest of the permanent set and are adapted from the great breadth of their crowns for grinding Fig. 510.—The permanent teeth. External view. UPPER JAW Molars Bicuspids Canine Incisors Canine and pounding the food. They are twelve in number: six in each jaw, three being placed behind each of the posterior bicuspids. The CTOivn is nearly cubical in form, rounded on each of its lateral surfaces, flattened in front and behind ; the upper surface being surmounted by four or five tubercles, or cusps (four in the upper, five in the lower molars), separated from each other by a crucial depression; hence their name, multicusindati. The nech is distinct, large, and rounded. The root is subdivided into from two to five fangs, each of which presents an aperture at its summit. ^h.Q first molar tooth is the largest and broadest of all ; its crown has usually five cusps, three outer and two inner. In the upper jaw the root consists of three fangs, widely separated from one another, two being external, the other internal. The latter is-the largest and longest, slightly grooved, and sometimes bifid. In the lower jaw the root consists of two fangs, one being placed in front, the other behind: they are both compressed from before backwards, and grooved on their contiguous faces, indicating a tendency to division.ORGANS OF DIGESTION 878 The second molar is a little smaller than the first. The crown has four cusps in the upper, and five in the lower jaw. The root has three fangs in the upper jaw, and two in the lower, the characters of which are similar to the preceding tooth. The third molar tooth is called the icisdom-tooth {dens sapientice), from its late appearance through the gum. It is smaller than the others, and its axis is directed inwards. The crown is small and rounded, and furnished with three tubercles. The root is generally single, short, conical, slightly curved, and grooved so as to present traces of a subdivision into three fangs in the upper, and two in the lower jaw. Temporary Teeth The temporary or milk teeth are smaller, but resemble in form those of the permanent set. The hinder of the two temporary molars is the largest of all the milk teeth, and is succeeded by the second permanent bicuspid. The first upper molar has only three cusps—two external, one internal; the second upper molar has four cusps. The first lower molar has four cusps ; the second lower molar Fig. 511.—The temporary, or milk teeth. External view. UPPER JAW Molars Canine Incisors Molars Canine Incisors has five. The fangs of the temporary molar teeth are smaller and more diverging than those of the permanent set, but in other respects bear a strong resemblance to them. Structure of the Teeth On making a vertical section of a tooth (fig. 512), a cavity will be found in the interior. This cavity is situated in the interior of the crown and the centre of each fang, and opens by a minute orifice at the extremity of the latter. The shape of the cavity corresponds somewhat with that of the tooth; it forms what is called the 2^uliJ-cavity, and contains a soft, highly vascular, and sensitive substance, the dental pulp. The pulp consists of a loose connective tissue and cells ; it is richly supplied with vessels and nerves, which enter the cavity through the small aperture at the point of each fang. The bells of the pulp are partly found permeating the connective tissue, and partly arranged as a layer on the wall of the pulp-cavity. These latter cells are of two kinds: some, columnar in shape, are named the odontoblasts of Waldejjer, and will be referred to hereafter ; others, fusiform in shape, are wedged in between the columnar cells, and have two fine processes, the outer or distal one passing into a dentine tubule ; the inner being879 STRUCTUEE OF THE TEETH continuous with the processes of the connective-tissue cells of the pulp-matrix. According to some anatomists, the processes of the odontoblasts are also continued into the dentine tubuli. The solid portion of the tooth consists of three distinct structures, viz. the proper dental substance, which forms the larger portion of the tooth, the ivory or dentine; a layer which covers Fig. 512.—Vertical the exposed part of the crown, the enamel; and a thin section of a molar layer, which is disposed on the surface of the fang, the cement or crusta petrosa. The ivory, or dentine (fig. 513), forms the principal mass of a tooth; in its central part is the cavity enclosing the pulp. It is a modification of osseous tissue, from which it differs, however, in structure. On microscopic examination, it is seen to consist of a number of minute wavy and branching tubes, having distinct parietes. They are called the dental tuhuli, and are embedded in a dense homogeneous substance, the intertubular tissue. The dental tubuli (fig. 514) are placed parallel with one another, and open at their inner ends into the pulp-cavity. In their course to the periphery they present two or three curves, and are twisted on themselves in a spiral direction. The direction of these tubes varies : they are vertical in the upper portion of the crown, oblique in the neck and upper part of the root, and towards the lower part of the Fig, 514.—Canine tooth of man, present- ing a transverse section of a portion of the root. (Magnified 300 diameters.) root they are inchned downwards. The tubuli, at their commencement, are about ^3^0 0 of an inch in diameter; in their course they divide and subdivide dichotomously, so as to give to the cut surface of the dentine a striated appear- ance. From the sides of the tubes, especially in the fang, ramifications of extreme minuteness are given off, which join together in loops in the intertubularOEGANS OF DIGESTION 88o substance, or terminate in small dilatations, from which branches are given off. Near the periphery of the dentine, the finer ramifications of the tubuli terminate in a layer of irregular branched spaces, which communicate with each other. These are called the interglobular spaces of Gzermak, or the gramilnr layer of Purkinje (fig. 514). The dental tubuli have comparatively thick walls, and contain slender cylindrical prolongations from the cells of the pulp-tissue, first described by Mr. Tomes, and named Tomes's fibres or dentinal fibres. These dentinal fibres are analogous to the soft contents of the canaliculi of bone. Between Tomes's fibres and the ivory of the canals there is an elastic homo- geneous membrane which resists the action of acids—the dentinal sheath of Neumann. The intertuhular suhstance is translucent, finely granular, and contains the chief part of the earthy matter of the dentine. After the earthy matter has been removed by steeping a tooth in weak acid, the animal basis remaining may be torn into laminae which run parallel with the pulp-cavity, across the direction of the tubes. A section of dentine often displays a series of somewhat parallel lines —the incremental lines of Salter. These lines are composed of a number of masses of imperfectly calcified dentine arranged in layers. In consequence of the imperfection in the calcifying process, little irregular cavities are left, termed interglobular spaces, similar to those in the granular layer, but larger. They have received their name from the fact that they are surrounded by minute nodules or globules of dentine. Other curved lines may be seen parallel to the surface. These are the lines of Schreger, and are due to the optical effect of simultaneous curvature of the dentinal fibres. Chemical Composition.—According to Berzelius and Bibra, dentine consists of 28 parts of animal and 72 of earthy matter. The animal matter is resolvable by boiling into gelatin. The earthy matter consists of phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, a trace of fluoride of calcium, phosphate of magnesia, and other salts. The enamel is the hardest and most compact part of a tooth, and forms a thin crust over the exposed part of the crown, as far as the commencement of the fang. It is thickest on the grinding surface of the crown, until worn away by attrition, and becomes thinner towards the neck. It consists of a congeries of minute hexagonal rods. They lie parallel with one another, resting by one extremity upon the dentine, which presents a number of minute depressions for their reception ; and forming the free surface of the crown by the other extremity. These fibres are directed vertically on the summit of the crown, horizontally at the sides ; they are about the of an inch in diameter, and pursue a more or less wavy course. The enamel is marked by a series of undulating lines, which cross each other, or ' decussate' ; these lines are doubtless formed by the variation in the course of the enamel-rods. Another series of lines, having a brown appearance, and denominated the parallel strice of Betzius, are seen on a section of the enamel. Their exact significance is uncertain. Numerous minute interstices intervene between the enamel fibres near their dentinal surface, a provision calculated to alloAV of the permeation of fluids from the dentinal tubule into the substance of the enamel. It is a disputed point whether the dentinal fibres penetrate a certain distance between the rods of the enamel or not. No nutritive canals exist in the enamel. Chemical Composition.—According to Bibra, enamel consists of 96*5 per cent, of earthy matter, and 3*5 per cent, of animal matter. The earthy matter con- sists of phosphate of lime, with traces of fluoride of calcium, carbonate of lime, phosphate of magnesia, and other salts. The cortical substance, or cement {crusta petrosa), is disposed as a thin layer on the roots of the teeth, from the termination of the enamel, as far as the apex of the fang, where it is usually very thick. In structure and chemical composition it resembles bone. It contains, sparingly, the lacunae and canaliculi which characterise true bone ; the lacunae placed near the surface have the canaliculi radiating from the side of the lacunae towards the periodontal membrane; and88i DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH those more deeply placed join with the adjacent dental tubuli. In the thicker portions of the crusta petrosa, the lamellae and Haversian canals peculiar to bone are also found. As age advances, the cement increases in thickness, and gives rise to those bony growths, or exostoses, so common in the teeth of the aged; the pulp-cavity becomes also partially filled up by a hard substance, intermediate in structure between dentine and bone {osteo-dentine, Owen; secondary dentine, Tomes). It appears to be formed by a slow conversion of the dental pulp, which shrinks, or even disappears. Development of the Teeth In describing the development of the teeth, we have first to consider the mode of formation of the temporary or milk teeth, and then that of the permanent series. Development of the temporary teeth.—The development of these teeth in the foetus begins at a very early period. About the seventh week, the margin of the jaw presents a slight longitudinal depression or groove, with rounded borders. This is termed the jjrimitive dental groo ve of Goodsir, and is caused by an involution of the epithelium of the oral cavity into the subjacent connective tissue. The projecting borders of the groove are called the dental ridges. The groove consists, therefore, superficially, of a collection of epithelial cells, beneath which is a gelatinous connective tissue, which is taken to represent the corium and connective tissue of the mucous membrane ; and deeper than this is the ossifying substance of the jaw. The essential structures of the teeth are derived from these elements : the enamel from the epithelium which covers the surface of the dental groove ; the dentine and crusta petrosa from the deeper structures. First, as to the enamel. The primitive dental groove increases in size by the growing up of the corium in front and behind, and is filled up and covered in by the epithelium, which becomes greatly increased in quantity, so that the groove is only indicated by a shallow superficial furrow. Secondary ridges of corium rise at intervals along the floor of the groove, dividing it into a series of pits. As the dental ridges—that is to say, the sides of the groove—rise up, epithelial masses are contained within the separate pits ; these are called enamel germs, and seem to pass deeper and deeper into the substance of the jaw, and at last meet with the papilla, presently to be described. The lower part of these masses of epithelial cells—that is, the part farthest from the margin of the jaw—spreads out in all directions, and the epithelial cells here increase in number. Each mass thus assumes a flask shape, which is connected by a narrow neck, embraced by the dental ridges, with the epithelial lining of the mouth. It may now be compared to a tubular gland, consisting of a dilated extremity filled with epithelium and opening by a narrow duct, also filled with epithelium, on the margin of the jaw. This narrow, constricted portion is called the nech of the enamel organ, and is of importance as being the part from which the enamel organ of the future permanent tooth is derived. The lower expanded portion of the mass of epithelial cells, the body of the flask, now inclines outwards so as to form an angle with the neck or more superficial part. In the soft connective tissue beneath this mass of epithelial cells, small papillae, corresponding in number to the pits in the primitive dental groove, arise by an increased development and growth of the corpuscles of the part. They grow upwards, become vascular, and come in contact with the epithelial cells of the enamel germ, and are received into dimples on its under surface. By continued growth they push their way up into the enamel germs, which become folded over them like a hood or cap. We have then, at this stage, vascular papillae which have already begun to assume somewhat the shape of the crowns of the future teeth, surmounted by domes or caps of epithelial cells, which were originally the cells contained in the lower or expanded part of the flask-shaped masses in the primitive dental groove (fig. 515). These cells now undergo a differentiation into three classes or varieties. Those which are in contact with the papilla and which are continuous 3L882 OEGANS OF DIGESTION through the neck of the enamel germ with the deepest layer of cells of the oral eiDithelium become elongated and form a layer of well-marked and regular columnar epithelium coating the papilla. These are named the internal enamel epithelium. The outer layer of cells of the enamel germ, which are in contact with the inner surface of the dentinal sac, presently to be described, are much shorter, cubical in form, and are named the external enamel epithelium. All the intermediate round cells of the enamel germ between these two layers undergo a peculiar change. They become stellate in shape, and their processes unite to form a network, which resembles gelatinous connective tissue. While these changes have been going on, the soft embryonic tissue, from which the papillae arose, and which is situated beneath the enamel germs, grows upwards in the form of ridges, surrounding the rudimentary teeth and becoming converted into a vascular membrane, constituting a sac—the dentinal sac, ^MYAch encloses each tooth. As they grow upwards, the two ridges approach one another, and, pene- trating the lips of the primitive groove, they cause the neck of the enamel organ to atrophy and disappear; so that all communication between the enamel germ and the superficial epithelium is cut off. Fig. 515.—Vertical section of the inferior maxilla of an early human foetus. (Magnified 25 diameters.) We have now vascular papillae, surmounted by inverted caps or capsules of epithelial cells, the whole being surrounded by membranous sacs. The cap or capsule consists of an internal layer of cells—the internal enamel epithelium—in contact with the papilla ; of an external layer of cells—the external enamel epithe- lium—lining the interior of the dentinal sac ; and of an intermediate mass of stellate cells, with anastomosing processes (fig. 516). The enamel is formed exclusiyely from the internal enamel epithelium, the columnar cells of which undergo direct calcification and become elongated into the hexagonal rods of the enamel. The intermediate cells atrophy and disappear, so that the calcified internal enamel epithelium and the external enamel epithelium come into close apposition, and the cells of this latter layer form a distinct membrane, named the cuticitla dentis or Nasmyth's membrane, which long remains perceptible, and, after the tooth has emerged from the gums, forms a horny layer, which may be separated from the calcified mass below by the action of strong acids. It is marked by the hexagonal impressions of the enamel prisms, and when stained by nitrate of silver shows the characteristic appearance of epithelium. It soon, however, wears away from the surface of the tooth. Formatio7i of the Dentine.—While these changes are taking place in the883 DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH epithelium to form the enamel, contemporaneous changes are occurring in the blastema or corium which result in the formation of the dentine and cement. As before stated, the first germ of the dentine consists in the formation of papilhns, corresponding in number to the teeth, from the soft connective tissue which bounds the depressions containing the enamel germ. The pa|)illge grow upwards into the enamel organ and become coated by it and enclosed in a vascular connective tissue, the dentinal sac, in the manner above described. They then constitute the formative pulp from which the dentine and permanent pulp are derived. Each papilla consists of rounded cells, and is very vascular, and soon begins to assume the shape of the tooth which is to be developed from it. The next step is the formation of the odontoblasts, which have a relation to the development of the teeth similar to that of the osteoblasts in the formation of bone. They are formed first from the cells of the periphery of the papilla, which become enlarged and of an elongated form and provided with numerous processes. These processes as they grow become calcified externally ; the calcified por- FiG. 516.—Dental sac of a human embryo development. at an advanced stage Partly diagrammatic. of tion forming the walls of the dentinal tubules, and the uncalcified axial portion forming the dentinal fibres (Tomes's fibres) which are contained within the tubules. In addition to this the lateral processes from the odonto- blasts form the branches of anastomosis whereby the dentinal canals com- municate. In this way the peripheral layer of the papilla becomes coated with a solid shell of dentine, on the inner surface of which a second layer of odontoblasts is arranged and in its turn calcifies, and thus the process goes on through the entire thickness of the dentine, the processes of one odonto- blast being directly continuous with those in succeeding layers, so that each dental fibre must be regarded as form- ed by several continuous odontoblasts. The central part of the papilla does not undergo calcification ; its cells pro- liferate, nerve-fibres are developed in it, and it remains persistent as the pulp of the tooth. The cement is formed from the wall of the dentinal sac, which is developed from the embryonic mass at the bottom of the dental groove from which the papilla originally sprung. So that the dentine and cement may be said to originate from analogous structures. In this membranous sac ossification goes on in a manner identical with the intra- membranous ossification of bone, and the cement formed is simply ordinary bone, containing canaliculi and lacunae. The germs of the milk teeth make their appearance in the following order : at the seventh week, the germ of the first molar of the upper jaw appears ; at the eighth week, that for the canine tooth is developed ; the two incisor papillae appear about the ninth week (the central preceding the lateral) ; lastly, the second molar papilla is seen at the tenth week, behind the anterior molar. The teeth of the lower jaw appear rather later, the first molar papilla being only just visible at the seventh week, and the second molar papilla not being developed before the eleventh week. Development of the permanent teeth.—The permanent teeth as regards their development may be divided into two sets : (i) those which replace the temporary teeth, and which, like them, are ten in number : these are the successionalpermanent 3 L 2 a.

These are three in number on either side in each jaw, and are termed the superadded immanent teeth. They are the three molars of the permanent set, the molars of the temporary set being replaced by the pre- molars or bicuspids of the permanent set. The development of the successional permanent teeth—the ten anterior ones in either jaw—will be first considered. In the neck of the enamel organ of the temporary tooth, prior to the meeting of the two dental ridges and the obliteration of this portion of the primitive dental groove, an indentation of the epithelium takes i^lace in the layer of cells forming the posterior wall of the neck of the sac. This forms a groove or indentation, similar to the groove in the oral epithelium of the margin of the jaw which formed the primitive dental groove, and from its resemblance is termed by Goodsir the secondary dental groove. These grooves or depressions are ten in number in each jaw, and are formed successively from before backwards. They become filled with epithelial cells, and recede into the substance of the gum behind the germs of the temporary teeth. They constitute the enamel germs of the permanent teeth. As they recede they become flask-shaped, from an expansion of their distal extremity, and finally meet a papilla, which has been formed in the corium, just in the same manner as was the case in the temporary teeth. The apex of the papilla indentates the enamel germ, which encloses it and, forming a cap for it, undergoes analogous changes to those described in the development of the milk teeth and becomes converted into the enamel; whilst the papilla forms the dentine of the permanent tooth. In its development it becomes enclosed in a dental sac which adheres to the back of the sac of the temporary tooth. The sac of each permanent tooth remams connected with the fibrous tissue of the gum by a slender band or guber- naculum, which passes to the margin of the jaw behind the corresponding milk tooth. The superadded permanent teeth—^three on each side in each jaw—arise from successive extensions backwards of the back part of the enamel germ of the immediately preceding tooth. During the fourth month, that portion of the enamel germ of the last temporary molar tooth which lies behind the tooth, and which has remained unaltered, is prolonged backwards and forms the enamel germ of the first permanent molar into which a papilla projects. From this tooth, in a similar manner, about the seventh month after birth, the second molar is formed ; and, about the third year, the third molar is formed by an extension backwards of the enamel germ of the second molar. Eruption.—When the calcification of the different tissues of the tooth is sufficiently advanced to enable it to bear the pressure to which it will be afterwards subjected, its eruption takes place ; the tooth making its way through the gum. The gum is absorbed by the pressure of the crown of the tooth against it, which is itself pressed up by the increasing size of the fang. At the same time the septa between the dental sacs, at first fibrous in structure, ossify, and constitute the alveoli; these firmly embrace the necks of the teeth, and aftbrd them a solid basis of support. The eruption of the temporary teeth commences at the seventh month, and is complete about the end of the second year, those of the lower jaw preceding the upper. The periods for the eruption of the temporary set are— yth month, central incisors. 12th to 14th month, anterior molars, yth to loth month, lateral incisors. 14th to 20th month, canine. 18th to 36th month, posterior molars. Calcification of the permanent teeth commences a little before birth, and proceeds in the following order in the upper jaw ; in the lower jaw a little earlier :— First molar, fifth or sixth month ; the central incisor, a little later ; lateral incisors and canine, about the eighth or ninth month ; the bicuspids at the second year; second molar, fifth or sixth year; wisdom-tooth about the twelfth year.885 THE PALATE Previous to the permanent teeth ^Denetrating the gum, the bony partitions which separate their sacs from the deciduous teeth are absorbed, the fangs of the temporary teeth disappear by absorption, through the agency of particular multi-nucleated cells, called odontoclasts, which are developed at the time in the neighbourhood of the fang, and the permanent teeth become placed under the loose crowns of the deciduous teeth; the latter finally become detached, and the permanent teeth take their place in the mouth. The eruption of the permanent teeth takes place at the following periods, the teeth of the lower jaw preceding those of the upper by a short interval:— 6\ years, first molars. loth year, second bicuspid. 7th year, two middle incisors. nth to 12th year, canine. 8th year, two lateral incisors. 12th to 13th year, second molars. 9th year, first bicuspid. 17th to 21st year, wisdom-teeth. The Palate The palate forms the roof of the mouth : it consists of two portions, the hard palate in front, the soft palate behind. The hard palate is bounded in front and at the sides by the alveolar arches and gums ; behind, it is continuous with the soft palate. It is covered by a dense structure formed by the periosteum and mucous membrane of the mouth, which are intimately adherent together. Along the middle hne is a linear ridge or raphe, which terminates anteriorly in a small papilla, corresponding with the inferior opening of the anterior palatine fossa. This papilla receives filaments from the naso-palatine and anterior palatine nerves. On either side and in front of the raphe the mucous membrane is thick, pale in colour, and corrugated; behind, it is thin, smooth, and of a deeper colour : it is covered with squamous epithelium, and furnished with numerous glands (palatal glands), which lie between the mucous membrane and the surface of the bone. The soft palate {velum ijenduimn palati) is a movable fold, suspended from the posterior border of the hard palate, and forming an incom]Dlete septum between the mouth and ]3harynx. It consists of a fold of mucous membrane, enclosing muscular fibres, an aponeurosis, vessels, nerves, adenoid tissue, and mucous glands. When occupying its usual position (i.e. relaxed and pendent), its anterior surface is concave, continuous with the roof of the mouth, and marked by a median ridge or raphe, which indicates its original separation into two lateral halves. Its posterior surface is convex, and continuous with the mucous membrane covering the floor of the posterior nares. Its upper border is attached to the posterior margin of the hard palate, and its sides are blended with the pharynx. Its lower border is free. Hanging from the middle of its lower border is a small, conical-shaped, pendulous process, the uvula ; and arching outwards and downwards from the base of the uvula on each side are two curved folds of mucous membrane, containing muscular fibres, called the arches or pillars of the soft palate. The anterior pillars run downwards, outwards, and forwards to the sides of the base of the tongue, and are formed by the projection of the Palato-glossi muscles, covered by mucous membrane. The posterior pillars are nearer to each other, and larger than the anterior; they run downwards, outwards, and backwards to the sides of the pharynx, and are formed by the projection of the Palato-pharyngei muscles, covered by mucous membrane. The anterior and posterior pillars are separated below by a triangular interval, in which the tonsil is lodged. The space left between the arches of the palate on the two sides is called the isthmus of the fauces. It is bounded, above, by the free margin of the soft palate ; below, by the back of the tongue ; and on each side, by the pillars of the soft palate and the tonsil. The mucous memhraVi6 of the soft palate is thin, and covered with squamous886 ORGANS OF DIGESTION epithelium on both surfaces, excepting near the orifice of the Eustachian tube, where it is columnar and ciliated.* Beneath the mucous membrane on the oral surface of the soft palate is a considerable amount of adenoid tissue. The palatine glands form a continuous layer on its posterior surface and round the uvula. The apo7ietirosis of the soft ]jaJate is a thin but firm fibrous layer attached above to the posterior border of the hard palate, and becoming thinner towards the free margin of the velum. Laterally, it is continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis. It forms the framework of the soft palate, and is joined by the tendon of the Tensor palati muscle. The muscles of tlie soft ijcdate are five on each side : the Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Palato-glossus, and Palato ]3haryngeus (see page 398). The following is the relative position of these structures in a dissection of the soft palate from the posterior or nasal to the anterior or oral surface. Immediately beneath the nasal mucous membrane is a thin stratum of muscular fibres, the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus muscle, joining with its fellow of the opposite side in the middle line. Beneath this is the Azygos uvulae, consisting of two rounded fleshy fasciculi, placed side by side in the median line of the soft palate. Next comes the aponeurosis of the Levator palati joining with the muscle of the opposite side in the middle line. Fourthly, the anterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus, thicker than the posterior, and separating the Levator palati from the next muscle, the Tensor palati. This muscle terminates in a tendon which, after winding round the hamular process, expands into a broad aponeurosis in the soft palate, anterior to the other muscles which have been enumerated. Finally, we have a thin muscular stratum, the Palato-glossus muscle, placed in front of the aponeurosis of the Tensor palati, and separated from the oral mucous membrane by adenoid tissue. The tonsils (amygdalcB) are two glandular organs, situated one on each side of the fauces, between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. They are of a rounded form, and vary considerably in size in different individuals. Exter- nally the tonsil is in relation with the inner surface of the Superior constrictor, which separates it from the internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries. It corresponds to the angle of the lower jaw. Its innei^ surface presents from twelve to fifteen orifices, leading into small recesses, from which numerous follicles branch out into the substance of the gland. These follicles are lined by a continua- tion of the mucous membrane of the pharynx, covered with epithelium ; around each follicle is a layer of closed capsules embedded in the submucous tissue. These capsules are analogous to those of Peyer's glands, consisting of adenoid tissue. No openings from the capsules into the follicles can be recognised. They contain a thick greyish secretion. Surrounding each follicle is a close plexus of lymphatic vessels. From these plexuses the lymphatic vessels pass to the deep cervical glands in the upper part of the neck, which frequently become enlarged in affections of these organs. The arteries supplying the tonsil are the dorsalis linguae from the lingual, the ascending palatine and tonsillar from the facial, the ascending pharyngeal from the external carotid, the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary, and a twig from the small meningeal. The veins terminate in the tonsillar plexus, on the outer side of the tonsil. The nerves are derived from Meckel's ganglion, and from the glosso-pharyngeal. The Salivaey Glands (fig. 517) The principal salivary glands communicating with the mouth, and pouring their secretion into its cavity, are the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. The parotid gland, so called from being placed near the ear {-n-apa, near ; ovc, o)t6c, the ear), is the largest of the three salivary glands, varying in weight from * According to Klein, the mucous membrane on the nasal surface of the soft palate is in the foetus covered throughout by columnar ciliated epithelium.THE SALIVARY GLANDS 887 half an ounce to an ounce. It lies upon the side of the face, immediately below and in front of the external ear. It is limited above by the zygoma ; below, by the angle of the jaw, and by a line drawn between it and the mastoid process: anteriorly, it extends to a variable extent over the Masseter muscle ; posteriorly, it is bounded by the external meatus, the mastoid process, and the Sterno-mastoid and Digastric muscles, slightly overlapping the latter. Its anterior surface is grooved to embrace the posterior margin of the ramus of the lower jaw, and advances forwards beneath the ramus, between the two Pterygoid muscles and in front of the ramus over the Masseter muscle. Its outer surface, slightly lobulated, is covered by the integument and parotid fascia, and has one or two lymphatic glands resting on it. Its inner surface extends deeply into the neck, by means of two large processes, one of which dips behind the styloid process, and projects beneath the mastoid process and the Sterno-mastoid muscle ; the other is situated in front of the styloid process, and passes into the back part of the glenoid Fig. 517.—The salivary glands. fossa, behind the articulation of the lower jaw. The structures passing through the parotid gland are, the external carotid artery, giving off its three terminal branches: the posterior auricular artery emerges from the gland behind ; the temporal artery above; the transverse facial, a branch of the temporal, in front ; and the internal maxillary winds through it as it passes inwards, behind the neck of the jaw. Superficial to the external carotid is the trunk formed by the union of the temporal and internal maxillary veins ; a branch, connecting this trunk with the internal jugular, also passes through the gland. It is also traversed by the facial nerve and its branches, which emerge at its anterior border; branches of the great auricular nerve pierce the gland to join the facial, and the auriculo- temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve emerges from the upper part of the gland. The internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lie close to its deep surface. The duct of the parotid gland (Stenson's) is about two inches and a half in length. It commences by numerous branches from the anterior part of the gland,888 OEGANS OF DIGESTION crosses the Masseter muscle, and at its anterior border dips down into the substance of the Buccinator muscle, which it pierces ; it then runs for a short distance obliquely forwards between the Buccinator and mucous membrane of the mouth, and opens upon the inner surface of the cheek by a small orifice, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. While crossing the Masseter it receives the duct of a small detached portion of the giand, socia parotidis, which occasionally exists as a separate lobe, just beneath the zygomatic arch. In this position it has the transverse facial artery above it and some branches of the facial nerve below it. Structure.—The parotid duct is dense, of considerable thickness, and its canal about the size of a crow-quill; it consists of an external or fibrous coat, of considerable density, containing contractile fibres, and of an internal or mucous coat lined with short columnar epithelium. Surface Form.—The direction of the duct corresponds to a line drawn across the face about a finger's breadth below the zygoma, that is, from the lower part of the tragus to midway between the free margin of the upper lip and the ala of the nose. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the parotid gland are derived from the external carotid, and from the branches given off by that vessel in or near its substance. The veins empty themselves into the external jugular, through some of its tributaries. The lymjjhatics terminate in the superficial and deep cervical Fig 518.—A highly magnified section of the submaxillary gland of the dog, stained with carmine. (Kolliker.) glands, passing in their course through two or three lymphatic glands, placed on the surface and in the substance of the parotid. The nerves are derived from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, the facial, the auriculo-temporal, and great auricular nerves. It is probable that the branch from the auriculo-temporal nerve is derived from the glosso-pharyngeal through the otic ganglion (see page 751). At all events in some of the lower animals this has been proved experimentally to be the case. The submaxillary gland is situated below the jaw, in the anterior part of the submaxillary triangle of the neck. It is irregular in form, and weighs about two drachms. It is covered by the integument, Platysma, deep cervical fascia, and the body of the lower jaw, corresponding to a depression on the inner surface of that bone; and lies upon the Mylo-hyoid, Hyo-glossus, and Stylo-glossus muscles, a portion of the gland passing beneath the posterior border of the Mylo-hyoid. In front of it is the anterior belly of the Digastric; behind, it is separated from the parotid gland by the stylo-maxillary ligament, and from the sublingual gland in front by the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The facial artery lies embedded in a groove in its posterior and upper border. The duct of the submaxillary gland {Wharton's) is about two inches in length, and its walls are much thinner than those of the parotid duct. It commences by numerous branches from the deep portion of the gland, and passes forwards and889 THE SALIVARY GLANDS inwards between the Mylo-hyoid and the Hyo-giossus and Genio-hyo-glossus muscles, then between the subhngnal gland and the Genio-hyo-glossus, and opens by a narrow orifice on the summit of a small papilla, at the side of the fr&enum linguae. On the Hyo-giossus muscle it lies between the lingual and hypoglossal nerves, but at the anterior border of the muscle it crosses under the lingual nerve, and is then placed above it. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the submaxillary gland are branches of the facial and lingual. Its veins follow the course of the arteries. The nerves are derived from the submaxillary ganglion, through which it receives filaments from the chorda tympani of the facial and lingual branch of the inferior maxillary, from the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental, and from the sympathetic. The sublingual gland is the smallest of the salivary glands. It is situated beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, at the side of the fraenum linguas, in contact with the inner surface of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis. It is narrow, flattened, in shape somewhat like an almond, and weighs about a drachm. It is in relation, above, with the mucous membrane; beloio, with the Mylo-hyoid muscle; in front, with the depression on the side of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and with its fellow of the opposite side; behind, with the deep part of the submaxillary gland ; and internally, with the Genio-hyo-giossus, from which it is separated by the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct. Its excretory ducts {ducts of Bivini), from eight to twenty in number, open separately into the mouth, on the elevated crest of mucous membrane, caused by the projection of the gland, on either side of the fr^num linguae. One or more join to form a tube, which opens into the Whartonian duct; this is called the duct of Bartholin. Vessels and Nerves.—The sublingual gland is supplied with blood from the sublingual and submental arteries. Its nerves are derived from the lingual. Structure of Salivary Glands.—The salivary are compound racemose glands, consisting of numerous lobes, which are made up of smaller lobules, connected together by dense areolar tissue, vessels, and ducts. Each lobule consists of the ramifications of a single duct, ' branching frequently in a tree-like manner,' the branches terminating in dilated ends or alveoli on which the capillaries are distributed. These alveoli, however, as Pflliger points out, are not necessarily spherical, though sometimes they assume that form ; sometimes they are perfectly cylindical, and very often they are mutually compressed. The alveoli are enclosed by a basement membrane, which is continuous with the membrana propria of the duct. It presents a peculiar reticulated structure, having the appearance of a basket with open meshes, and consisting of a network of branched and flattened nucleated cells. The alveoli of the salivary glands are of two kinds, which differ both in the appearance of their secreting cells, in their size, and in the nature of their secretion. The one variety secretes a ropy fluid, which contains mucin, and has therefore been named the mucous ; whilst the other secretes a thinner and more watery fluid, which contains serum-albumin, and has been named serous or albuminous. The sublingual gland may be regarded as an example of the former variety; the parotid of the latter. The submaxillary is of the mixed variety, containing both mucous and serous alveoli, the latter, however, preponderating. Both alveoli are lined by cells, and it is by the character of these cells that the nature of the gland is chiefly to be determined. In addition, however, the alveoli of the serous glands are smaller than those of the mucous ones. The cells in the mucous alveoli are spheroidal in shape, glassy, transparent, and dimly striated in appearance. The nucleus is usually situated in the part of the cell which is next the basement membrane, against which it is sometimes flattened. The most remarkable peculiarity presented by these cells is, that they give off an extremely fine process, which is curved in a direction parallel to the surface of the alveolus, lies in contact with the membrana propria, and overlaps the processes of neighbouring cells. The cells contain a quantity of mucin, to which their clear, transparent appearance is due.ORGANS OF DIGESTION 890 Here and there in the alveoU are seen pecuhar half-moon-shaped bodies, lying between the cells and the membrana propria of the alveolus. They are termed the crescents of Giaimz.zi, or the demilunes of Heidenhain (fig. 518), and are regarded by Pfliiger as due to post-mortem change, but by most other later observers they are believed to be composed of polyhedral granular cells, which Heidenhain regards as young epithelial cells destined to supply the place of those salivary cells which have undergone disintegration. This view, however, is not accepted by Klein. Serous alveoli.—In the serous alveoli the cells almost completely fill the cavity, so that there is hardly any lumen perceptible. Instead of presenting the clear transparent appearance of the cells of the mucous alveoh, they present a granular appearance, due to distinct granules, of an albuminous nature, embedded in a closely reticulated protoplasm. The ducts which originate out of the alveoli are lined at their commencement by epithelium which differs little from the pavement type. As the ducts enlarge, the epithelial cells change to the columnar type, and they are described by Pfliiger as attached to the basement membrane by a brush of fine hair-like processes, which he believes to be continuous with the nerve-fibres. Other anatomists regard these cells as merely striated on their deep surface. The lobules of the salivary glands are richly supplied with blood-vessels which form a dense network in the interalveolar spaces. Fine plexuses of nerves are also found in the Fig. 519.—Illustrating Pfluger's views of the termination of the nerves in the alveolar colls. (From Strieker's ' Handbook.' ) A. Direct passage of uerve into a salivary cell. B. By the medium of a multipolar ganglion-cell, [/. interlobular tissue. Pfliiger describes the nerves as being directly continuous with the salivary cells of the alveolus, the nerve sometimes passing through a ganglion- cell just before joining the alveolus (fig. 519, a and b). This fact has not, however, been corroborated by other observers. There is no doubt that ganglia are to be found in some salivary glands in connection with the nerve-plexuses in the inter- lobular tissue ; thus they are to be found in the submaxillary, but not in the parotid ; but whether the ultimate fibrils are connected with the salivary cells, as asserted by Pfliiger, remains to be proved. In the submaxillary and sublingual glands the lobes are larger and more loosely united than in the parotid. Mucous Glands.—Besides the salivary glands proper, numerous other glands are found in the mouth. They appear to secrete mucus only, which serves to keep the mouth moist during the intervals of the salivary secretion, and which is mixed with that secretion in swallowing. Many of these glands are found at the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue, behind the circumvallate papilla, and also along its margins as far forward as the apex.* Others lie around and in the tonsil * It has recently been shown by Ebner that many of these glands open into the trenches around the circumvallate papillae, and that their secretion is more watery than that of ordinary mucous glands. He supposes that they assist in the more rapid distribution of the substance to be tasted over tlie region where the special apparatus of the sense of taste is situated.891 THE MOUTH between its crypts, and a large number in the soft palate. These glands are of the ordinary compound racemose type. Surface Form.—The orifice of the mouth is bounded by the lips : two thick, fleshy folds covered externally hy integument and mternally by mucous membrane, and consisting of muscles, vessels, nerves, areolar tissue, and numerous small glands. The size of the orifice of the mouth varies considerablj- in different individuals, but seems to bear a close relation to the size and prominence of the teeth. Its corners correspond pretty accurately to the outer border of the canine teeth. In the Mongolian tribes, where the front teeth are large and inclined forward, the mouth is large; and this, combined with the thick and everted lips, Avhich appear to be associated with prominent teeth, gives to the Negro's face much of the peculiarity by which it is characterised. The smaller teeth, and the slighter prominence of the alveolar arch of the more highly civilised races, render the orifice of the mouth much smaller, and thus a small mouth is an indication of intelligence, and is regarded as an evidence of the higher civilisation of the individual. Upon looking into the mouth, the first thing we may note is the tongue, the upper surface of which will be seen occupying the floor of the cavity. This surface is convex, and is marked along the middle line by a raphe, which divides it into two symmetrical portions. The anterior two-thirds is rough and studded with papillae ; the posterior third smooth and tuberculated, covered by numerous glands which project from the surface. Upon raising the tongue, the mucous membrane which invests the upper surface may be traced covering the sides of the under sm-face and then reflected over the floor of the mouth on to the inner surface of the lower jaw, a part of which it covers. As it passes over the borders of the tongue it changes its character, becoming thin and smooth, and losing the papillae which are to be seen on the upper surface. In the middle line the mucous membrane on the under surface of the tip of the tongue forms a distinct fold, the frcenum linguce, by which this organ is connected to the symphysis of the jaw. Occasionally it is found that this fraenum is rather shorter than natural, and, acting as a bridle, prevents the complete protrusion of the tongue. When this condition exists and an attempt is made to protrude the organ, the tip will be seen to remain buried in the floor of the mouth, and the dorsum of the tongue is rendered very convex, and more or less extruded from the mouth : at the same time a deep furrow will be noticed to appear in the middle line of the anterior part of the dorsum. Sometimes, a little external to the fraenum, the ranine vein may be seen immediately beneath the mucous membrane. The corresponding artery, being more deeply placed, does not come into view, nor can its pulsation be felt with the finger. On either side of the fraenum, in the floor of the mouth, is a longitudinal elevation or ridge, produced by the projection of the sublingual gland, which lies immedi- ately beneath the mucous membrane. And close to the attachment of the fraenum to the tip of the tongue may be seen on either side the slit-like orifices of AVharton's ducts, into which a fine probe may be passed without much difficulty. By everting the lips the smooth mucous membrane lining them may be examined, and may be traced from them on to the outer surface of the alveolar arch. In the middle line, both of the upper and lower lip, a small fold of mucous membrane passes from the lip to the bone, constituting the frcena ; these are not so large as the fraenum linguae. By pulling outwards the angle of the mouth the mucous membrane lining the cheeks can be seen, and on it may be perceived a little papilla which marks the position of the orifice of Stenson's duct—the duct of the parotid g^land. The exact position of the orifice of the duct will be found to be opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The introduction of a probe into this duct is attended with considerable difficulty. The teeth are the next objects which claim our attention upon looking into the mouth. There are, as stated above, ten in either jaw in the temporary set, and sixteen in the permanent set. The gums, in which they are implanted, are dense, firm, and vascular. At the back of the mouth is seen the isthmus of the fances, or, as it is popularly called, ' the throat': this is the space between the pillars of the fauces on either side, and is the means by which the mouth connnunicates with the pharynx. Above, it is bounded by the soft palate, the anterior surface of which is concave and covered with mucous membrane, which is continuous with that lining the roof of the mouth. Projecting from the middle of its lower border is a conical-shaped projection, the uvula. On either side of the isthmus of the fauces are the anterior and posterior pillars, formed by the Palato-glossus and Palato- pharyngeu3 muscles respectively, covered over by mucous membrane. Between the two pillars on either side is situated the tonsil. By their external surface these glands are in close relationship with the internal carotid artery, being separated from this vessel only by the thin plane of muscular fibres forming the wall of the pharynx. It is stated that this vessel may be woimded in removing the tonsil. The extirpation of this glandular body is not unattended with danger of haemorrhage from other sources. Dr. Weir has stated that he believes that when haemorrhage occurs after their removal, it arises from one of the palatine arteries having been wounded. These vessels are large : they lie in the muscular tissue of the palate, and when wounded are constantly exposed to disturbance from the contraction of the palatine muscles. The vessels of the tonsil. Dr. Weir states, are small, and lie in the soft tissue, and readily contract when wounded. When the mouth is wide open a prominent tense fold of mucous membrane may beORGANS OF DIGESTION 892 seen and felt extending upwards and backwards from the position of the fang of the last molar tooth to the posterior part of the hard palate. This is caused by the Pterygo- maxillary ligament which is attached by one extremity to the apex of the internal pterygoid plate, and by the other to the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw. It connects the Buccinator with the Superior constrictor of the pharynx. The fang of the last molar tooth indicates the position of the lingual (gustatory) nerve, where it is easily accessible, and can with readiness be divided in cases of cancer of the tongue (see page 753). On the inner side of the last molar tooth we can feel the haniular process of the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone, around which the tendon of the Tensor palati plays. The exact position of this process is of importance in performing the operation of staphy- loraphy. About one-third of an inch in front of the hamular process and the same distance directly inwards from the last molar tooth is the situation of the opening of the posterior palatine canal, through which emerges the posterior or descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery, and one of the descending palatine nerves from Meckel's ganglion. The exact position of the opening on the subject may be ascertained by driving a needle through the tissues of the palate in this situation, when it will be at once felt to enter the canal. The artery emerging from the opening runs forwards in a groove in the bone, just internal to the alveolar border of the hard palate, and may be wounded in the operation for the cure of cleft palate. Under these circumstances the palatine canal may require plugging. By introducing the finger into the mouth the anterior border of the coronoid process of the jaw can be felt, and is especially prominent when the jaw is dislocated. By throwing the head well back a considerable portion of the posterior wall of the pharynx may be seen through the isthmus faucium, and on introducing the finger the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the upper cervical vertebras may be felt immediately beneath the thin muscular stratum forming the wall of the pharynx. The finger can be hooked round the posterior border of the soft palate, and by turning it forwards, the posterior nares, separated by the septum, can be felt, or the presence of any adenoid or other growths in the naso-pharynx ascertained. The Phabynx The pharynx is that part of the alimentary canal which is placed behind the nose, mouth, and larynx. It is a musculo-membranous sac, somewhat conical in form, with the base upwards, and the apex downwards, extending from the under sm^face of the skull to the cricoid cartilage in front, and the intervertebral disc between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae behind. The pharynx is about four inches and a half in length, and broader in the transverse than in the antero-posterior diameter. Its greatest breadth is opposite the cornua of the hyoid bone ; its narrow^est point at its termination in the oesophagus. It is limited, above, by the body of the sphenoid and basilar process of the occipital bone ; beloio, it is continuous with the oesophagus ; posteriorly, it is connected by loose areolar tissue with the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and the Longi colli and Recti capitis antici muscles; anteriorly, it is incomplete, and is attached in succession to the internal pterygoid plate, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, the lower jaw, the tongue, hyoid bone, and thyroid and cricoid cartilages ; laterally, it is connected to the styloid processes and their muscles, and is in contact with the common and internal carotid arteries, the internal jugular veins, and the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves, and above with a small part of the Internal pterygoid muscles. It has seven openings communicating with it: the two posterior nares, the two Eustachian tubes, the mouth, larynx, and oesophagus. The posterior nares are the two oval openings (see page 193) situated at the upper part of the anterior wall of the pharynx. The tiuo Eustachian tubes open one at each side of the upper part of the pharynx, at the back part of the inferior meatus. Below the posterior nares are the posterior surface of the soft palate and uvula, the large aperture of the mouth, the base of the tongue, the epiglottis, and the cordiform opening of the larynx. The (esophageal opening is the lower contracted portion of the pharynx. Structure.—The pharynx is composed of three coats : mucous, fibrous, and muscular. The pharyngeal aponeurosis, or fibrous coat, is situated between the mucous and muscular layers. It is thick above where the muscular fibres are wanting, and is firmly connected to the basilar process of the occipital and petrous portion of theTHE (ESOPHAGUS 893 temporal bones. As it descends it diminishes in thickness, and is gradually lost. It is strengthened posteriorly by a strong fibrous band, which is attached above to the pharyngeal spine on the under surface of the basilar portion of the occipital bone, and passes downwards, forming a median raphe, which gives attachment to the Constrictor muscles of the pharynx. The mucous coat is continuous with that lining the Eustachian tubes, the nares, the mouth, and the larynx. It is covered by columnar ciliated epithelium, as low down as on a level with the floor of the nares : below that point the epithelium is of the squamous variety. Beneath the mucous membrane are found racemose mucous glands; they are especially numerous at the upper part of the pharynx around the orifices of the Eustachian tubes. Throughout the pharynx are also numerous crypts or recesses, the walls of which are surrounded by lymphoid tissue, similar to what is found in the tonsils. Across the back part of the pharyngeal cavity, between the two Eustachian tubes, a considerable mass of this tissue exists, and has been named the i:>haryngeal tonsil. Above this in the middle line is an irregular, flask-shaped depression of the mucous membrane, extending up as far as the basilar process of the occipital bone. It is known as the bursa pharyngea, and is the remains of the diverticulum of the alimentary canal, which is concerned in the development of the pituitary body (see page 90). The muscular coat has been already described (page 396). Surgical Anatomy.—The internal carotid artery is in close relation with the pharynx, so that its pulsations can be felt through the month. It has been occasionally wounded by sharp-pointed instruments, introduced into the mouth and thrust through the wall of the pharynx. In aneurism of this vessel in the neck, the tumour necessaril}- bulges into the pharynx, as this is the direction in which it meets with the least resistance, nothing lying between the vessel and the mucous membrane except the thin Constrictor muscle, whereas on the outer side there is the dense cervical fascia, the muscles descending from the styloid process and the margin of the Sterno-mastoid. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is very vascular, and is often the seat of inflammation, frequently of a septic character, and dangerous on account of its tendency to spread to the larynx. On account of the tissue which surrounds the pharyngeal wall being loose and lax, the inflammation is liable to spread through it far and wide, extending downwards into the posterior mediastinum along the oesophagus. Abscess may form in the connective tissue behind the pharynx, between it and the vertebral column, constituting what is known as post-pharyngeal abscess. This is most commonly due to caries of the cervical vertebras, but may also be caused by suppuration of a lymphatic gland, which is situated in this position opposite the axis, and which receives lymphatics from the nares, or by a gumma or by acute pharyngitis. The abscess may be most easily evacuated bv an incision, with a guarded bistoury, through the mouth. It has recently been proposed to open the abscess aseptically by an incision in the neck behind the Sterno-mastoid. The operation, however, is a difficult one, unless the abscess is pointing laterally and does not give such free access to the seat of disease for the removal of necrosed bone, if any exists, and does not appear to present sufficient advantages to warrant its performance. Foreign bodies not unfrequently become lodged in the pharynx, and most usually at its termination at about the level of the cricoid cartilage, just beyond the reach of the finger, as the distance from the arch of the teeth to the commencement of the oesophagus is about six inches. The position of the opening of the Eustachian tubes should be carefully studied with a view to catheterism of these tubes, and the student should practise passing a catheter into them. This is to be done by introducing the instrument through the anterior nares, so that its point rests on the floor of the nasal cavity close to the septum ; it is then pushed gradually and slowly backwards until the posterior wall of the pharynx is reached. Then, having been slightly withdrawn so as to free the point from the wall of the pharynx, it is rotated outwards and upwards, so that the ring of the instrument is turned towards the external ear, and it can then be made to glide into the Eustachian tube. The (Esophagus The (Bsophagus, or gullet, is a muscular canal, about nine inches in length, extending from the pharynx to the stomach. It commences at the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, opposite the intervertebral disc between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, descends along the front of the spine, through the posterior mediastinum, passes through the Diaphragm, and, entering the abdomen, terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach, opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra or theORGANS OF DIGESTION 894 intervertebral disc between the tenth and eleventh dorsal vertebrae. The general direction of the cesophagns is vertical; but it presents two or three slight curves in its course. At its commencement it is placed in the median line ; but it inclines to the left side as far as the root of the neck, gradually passes to the middle line again, and finally again deviates to the left as it passes forwards to the oesophageal opening of the Diaphragm. The oesophagus also presents an antero-posterior flexure, corresponding to the curvature of the cervical and thoracic portions of the spine. It is the narrowest part of the alimentary canal, being most contracted at its commencement, and at the point where it passes through the Diaphragm. Eelations.—In the neck, the oesophagus is in relation, i)i front, with the trachea; and, at the lower part of the neck, where it projects to the left side, with the thyroid gland and thoracic duct ; behind, it rests upon the vertebral column and Longi colli muscles; on each side, it is in relation with the common carotid artery (especially the left, as it inclines to that side), and part of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland; the recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend between it and the trachea. In the thorax, it is at first situated a little to the left of the median line ; it then passes behind the left side of the aortic arch, and descends in the posterior mediastinum, along the right side of the aorta, nearly to the Diaphragm, where it passes in front and a little to the left of the artery, previous to entering the abdomen. It is in relation, in front, with the trachea, the arch of the aorta, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries, the left bronchus, and the posterior surface of the pericardium ; behind, it rests upon the vertebral column, the Longi colli muscles, and the intercostal vessels ; and below, near the Diaphragm, upon the front of the aorta ; laterally, it is covered by the pleurae : the vena azygos major lies on the right, and the descending aorta on the left side. The pneiimogastric nerves descend in close contact Avith it, the right nerve passing down behind, and the left nerve in front of it. Structure.—The oesophagus has three coats : an external or muscular ; a middle or areolar ; and an internal or mucous coat. The muscular coat is composed of two planes of fibres of considerable thickness : an external longitudinal, and an internal circular. The longitudinal fibres are arranged, at the commencement of the tube, in three fasciculi: one in front, which is attached to the vertical ridge on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage ; and one at each side, which is continuous with the fibres of the Inferior constrictor : as they descend they blend together, and form a uniform layer, which covers the outer surface of the tube. Accessory slips of muscular fibres are described by Dr. Cunningham as passing between the oesophagus and the pleura, where it covers the thoracic aorta (almost always), or the root of the left bronchus (usually), or the back of the pericardium, or corner of the mediastinum (more rarely), as well as other still more rare accessory fibres. In fig. 520, taken from a dissection in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, several of these accessory slips may be seen passing from the oesophagus to the pleura, and two slips to the back of the trachea just above its bifurcation. The circular fibres are continuous above with the Inferior constrictor ; their direction is transverse at the upper and lower parts of the tube, but oblique in the central part. The muscular fibres in the upper part of the oesophagus are of a red colour, and consist chiefly of the striped variety; but below, they consist for the most part of involuntary muscular fibre. The areolar coat connects loosely the mucous and muscular coats. The mucous coat is thick, of a reddish colour above, and pale below. It is disposed in longitudinal folds, which disappear on distension of the tube. Its surface is studded with minute papillae, and it is covered throughout with a thick layer of stratified pavement epithelium. Beneath the mucous membrane, between it and the areolar coat, is a layer of longitudinally arranged non-striped muscular fibres. This is the muscularis mucosce. At the commencement it is895 THE (ESOPHAGUS absent, or only represented by a few scattered bundles ; lower down it forms a considerable stratum. The esophageal glands are numerous small compound racemose glands scattered throughout the tube ; they are lodged in the submucous tissue, and open upon the surface by a long excretory duct. They are most numerous at the lower part of the tube, where they form a ring round the cardiac orifice. Vessels of the oesophagus.—The arteries supplying the oesophaLgus are derived from the inferior thyroid branch of the thyroid axis of the subclavian ; from the descending thoracic aorta, and from the gastric branch of the coeliac axis from the abdominal aorta. They have for the most part a longitudinal direction. Nerves of the oesophagus.—The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and from the sympathetic ; they form a plexus, in which are groups of ganglion cells, between the two layers of the muscular coats, and also a second plexus in the submucous tissue. Surgical Anatomy.—The relations of the oeso- phagus are of considerable practical interest to the surgeon, as he is frequently required, ih cases of stric- ture of this tube, to dilate the canal by a bougie, when it is of importance that the direction of the oesophagus, and its relations to surrounding parts, should be re- membered. In cases of malignant disease of the oesophagus, where its tissues have become softened from infiltration of the morbid deposit, the greatest care is requisite in (,lirecting the bougie through the strictured part, as a false passage may easily be made, and the instrument may pass into the mediastinum, or into one or the other pleural cavity, or even into the pericardium. The student should also remember that contraction of the oesophagus, and consequent symptoms of stric- ture, are occasionally produced b}^ an aneurism of some part of the aorta pressing upon this tube. In such a case, the passage of a bougie could only hasten the fatal issue. In passing a bougie the left forefinger should be introduced into the mouth, and the epiglottis felt for, care being taken not to throw the head too far back- wards. The bougie is then to be passed beyond the finger until it touches the posterior wall of the pharynx. The patient is now asked to swallow, and at the moment of swallowing the bougie is passed gently onwards, all violence being carefully avoided. It occasionally happens that a foreign body be- comes impacted in the oesophagus, which can neither be brought upwards nor moved downwards. When all ordinary means for its removal have failed, excision is the only resource. This, of course, can only be per- formed when it is not very low down. If the foreign bod}^ is allowed to remain, extensive inflammation and ulceration of the oesophagns may ensue. In one case the foreign body ultimately penetrated the intervertebral substance, and destroyed life by inflammation of the mem- branes and substance of the cord. The operation of oesophagotomy is thus performed. The patient being placed upon his back, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated, an incision, about four inches in length, should be made on the left side of the trachea, from the thyroid cartilage downwards, dividing the skin and Platysma. The edges of the wound being separated, the Omo-hyoid muscle should, if necessar3^, be divided, and the fibres of the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno- thyroid muscles drawn inwards ; the sheath of the carotid vessels being exposed, should be drawn outwards, and retained in that position by retractors : the oesophagus will now be exposed, and should be divided over the foreign body, which can then be removed. Great care is necessary to avoid wounding the thyroid vessels, the thyroid gland, and the laryngeal nerves. The oesophagus may be obstructed not only by foreign bodies, but also by changes in its coats, producing stricture, or by pressure on it from without of new growths or aneurism, etc. Fig. 520.—Accessory muscular fibres between the oesophagus and pleura, and oesophagus and trachea. (From a prepara- tion in the Museum of the Koyal College of Surgeons.)OKGANS OF DIGESTION 896 The different forms of stricture are : (i) the spasmodic, usually occmrring in nervous women, and intermittent in character, so that the dj^sphagia is not constant ; (2) fibrous, due to cicatrisation after injuries, such as swallowing corrosive fluids or boiling water ; and (3) malignant, usually epitheliomatous in its nature. This is situated generally either at the upper end of the tube, opposite the cricoid cartilage, or at its lower end at the cardiac orifice, but is also occasionally found at that part of the tube where it is crossed by the left bronchus. The oj)eration of oesophagostomy has occasionally been performed m cases where the stricture in the oesophagus is at the upper part, with a view to making a permanent opening below the stricture through which to feed the patient, but the operation has been far from a successful one, and the risk of setting up diffuse inflammation in the loose planes of connective tissue deep in the neck is so great that it would appear to be better, if any ofterative interference is undertaken, to perform gastrostomy. The operation is performed in the same manner as oesophagotomy, but the edges of the opening in the oesophagus are stitched to the skin incision. THE ABDOMEN The Abdomen is the largest cavity in the body. It is of an oval form, the extremities of the oval being directed upwards and downwards : the upper one being formed by the under sm-face of the Diaphragm, the lower by the upper concave sm^face of the Levator ani. In order to facilitate description, it is artificially divided into two parts : an upper and larger part, the abdomen proper ; and a lower and smaller part, the pelvis. These two cavities are not separated from each other, but the limit between them is marked by the brim of the true pelvis. The space , is wider above than below, and measures more in the vertical than in the transverse diameter. Boundaries.—The abdomen proper is bounded, in front and at the sides, by the lower ribs, the abdominal muscles, and the venter ilii; behind, by the vertebral column and the Psoas and Quadratus lumborum muscles ; above, by the Dia- phragm ; below, by the brim of the pelvis. The muscles forming the boundaries of the cavity are lined upon their inner surface by a layer of fascia, differently named according to the part which it covers. The abdomen contains the greater part of the alimentary canal; some of the accessory organs to digestion, viz. the liver, pancreas, and spleen ; and the kidneys and suprarenal capsules. Most of these structures, as well as the wall of the cavity in which they are contained, are covered by an extensive and complicated serous membrane, the peritoneum. The apertures found in the walls of the abdomen, for the transmission of structures to or from it, are, the mnbilicus, for the transmission (in the foetus) of the umbilical vessels ; the caval opening in the Diaphragm, for the transmission of the inferior vena cava ; the aortic opening, for the passage of the aorta, vena azygos, and thoracic duct; and the oesophageal opening, for the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves. Beloio, there are two apertures on each side : one for the passage of the femoral vessels, and the other for the transmission of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. Regions.—For convenience of description of the viscera, as well as of reference to the morbid condition of the contained parts, the abdomen is artificially divided into nine regions. Thus, if two circular lines are drawn round the body, the one through the extremities of the ninth ribs, where they join their costal cartilages, and the other through the highest point of the crests of the ilia, the abdominal cavity is divided into three zones—an upper, a middle, and a lower. If two parallel lines are drawn perpendicularly upwards from the centre of Poupart's ligament, each of these zones is subdivided into three parts—a middle and two lateral. The middle region of the upper zone is called the epigastric {k-rrt, over ; yaanqp, the stomach); and the two lateral regions, the right and left hypochondriac (vvo, under ; ^o^^po'-^ the cartilages). The central region of the middle zone is the umbilical; and the two lateral regions, the right and left lumbar. The middle region of the lower zone is the hypogastric on pubic region; and the lateral regions898 ORGANS OF DIGESTION are the right and left inguinal or iliac. The viscera contained in these different regions are the following (fig. 522):— Eight Hypochondriac Epigastric Begion Left Hypochondriac The right lobe of the The pyloric end of the The splenic end of the liver and the gall-blad- stomach, left lobe of the stomach, the spleen and der, hepatic flexm^e of the liver, and lobulus Spigelii, extremity of the pancreas, colon, and part of the the pancreas, the duode- the splenic flexure of the right kidney. num, parts of the kidneys colon, and part of the left and the suprarenal capsules, kidney.

In consequence of the number and different shapes of these viscera, the reflections of the peritoneum, as it invests them, are exceedingly complex and difficult to understand. The peritoneum partially invests all the viscera contained in the abdominal and pelvic cavities, forming the visceral layer of the membrane ; it is then reflected upon the internal surface of the parietes of those cavities, forming the parietal layer. The free surface of the peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a layer of flattened endothelial cells ; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the parietes by means of areolar tissue called the subserous areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to get a flrst general idea of the peritoneum and its reflections, the student should bear in mind that all the abdominal and pelvic viscera are placed external to it, and that it is a shut sac superimposed upon the viscera.* Let the student imagine that all the viscera are in their proper positions in the abdominal cavity, but uninvested by peritoneum. Upon the top of them is placed a large closed sac, the walls of which are of extreme thinness, and wherever * We may disregard, for the present, the fact that the peritoneum in the female is not an absolutely closed sac, since the Fallopian tubes open into it at their free extremities. 3 M 2 Fig. 523.—The reflections of the peritoneum, as seen in a vertical section of the abdomen. - Lesser omentum Passes through foramen of WinslowORGANS OF DIGESTION 900 there is a cleft between two viscera a process of peritoneum derived from the part of the sac in contact with the viscera is tucked in between them, so as to cover the adjacent surfaces of the two viscera and separate them from each other, and at the same time, by becoming adherent to the viscera, form an investment for them. Thus in fig. 523 such a diverticulum or process may be seen tucked in between the under surface of the liver and the upper surface of the stomach, and extending between the two as far backwards as the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, which it covers on their anterior surfaces, forming the anterior layer of what is termed the lesser omentum. Another diverticulum or process is tucked in round the hepatic artery, as it passes forwards and upwards to the liver, and afterwards expands into a large sac or bag, which covers the posterior surface of the liver and stomach, and the upper part of the posterior wall of the abdomen, separating these structures from each other. This large cul-de-sac of peritoneum is called the lesser cavity of the peritoneuni, but is only a part of the general cavity differentiated from it by the constriction produced at the situation of the hepatic artery. In this respect the peritoneum may be compared to an hourglass with two unequal globes : the smaller one constituting the lesser cavity of the peritoneum; the larger one the greater cavity; and the constriction where the two globes communicate corre- sponding to the constriction in the peritoneum where it hooks round the hepatic artery. This constriction is called the foramen of Winslow. Between the transverse fissure of the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach there is thus a double layer of peritoneum : the anterior layer being part of the greater bag of the peritoneum, where it is tucked in between the liver and the stomach from the front; while the posterior layer is part of the lesser bag of the peritoneum where it is tucked in round the hepatic artery. These two layers constitute the lesser omentum. Between the two layers are situated the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the hepatic duct. A process of this lesser bag of the peritoneum is pushed backwards and upwards behind the liver, extending as far as the under surface of the Diaphragm, the posterior part of which it covers. At its extremity this process is in contact with a process of the greater bag of the peritoneum, which is pushed in from the front, in the cleft between the upper surface of the liver and the under surface of the Diaphragm. Where these two layers are in contact (passing down from the Diaphragm to the liver) they form some of the ligaments of the liver, thus supporting and holding it in position. Another process of this lesser bag is pushed downwards between the stomach and the transverse colon and forms the two inner of the four layers of the great omentum. Thus the lesser cavity of the peritoneum is seen to be a complete sac or bag, separating the back and part of the under surface of the liver, the posterior wall of the stomach, and the upper surface of the transverse colon from the back part of the under surface of the Diaphragm and the upper part of the posterior wall of the abdomen. The greater cavity of the peritoneum separates the anterior surfaces of the viscera from the front wall of the abdomen ; so that in our comparison of the two cavities to an hourglass it must be borne in mind that they are not in the same straight line as the two globes of the hourglass, but that, at the point of constriction, the smaller cavity is bent round the hepatic artery, so as to lie behind the greater cavity. The greater sac of the peritoneum is placed in front of the viscera, one layer being in contact with them, the other lining the inner surface of the anterior wall of the abdomen. The layer which is in relation with the viscera sends backwards diverticula which pass between the various organs, and in certain places comes in contact with the peritoneum forming the lesser bag, in the manner described above. Thus we have one of these diverticula sent backwards between the liver and Dia- phragm, covering the anterior part of the under surface of the Diaphragm, until it meets the peritoneum of the lesser cavity, and covering the upper surface of the liver as far backwards as the ligaments. The extremity of this diverticulum is inTHE PERITONEUM 901 contact with a similar diverticulum of the lesser bag, already described, and the two layers, when in apposition, form the coronary and lateral ligaments of the liver. Another process, which has already been mentioned, is sent backwards between the under surface of the liver and the stomach, to meet a similar process of the lesser cavity prolonged from behind forwards. Where the two are in apposition the lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum is formed. A third diverticulum is. carried backwards to the posterior wall of the abdomen between the transverse colon and the small intestine. This prolongation covers the under surface of the transverse colon, and forms the under layer of the transverse meso-colon, and the upper layer of the mesentery ; by its extremity it is in contact with the posterior wall of the abdomen, and covers a part of the abdominal aorta. Between the greater curvature of the stomach and the transverse colon there is a fold or reduphcation of the peritoneum, which contains between its layers a similar fold from the lesser cavity, and forms the apron or great omentum. Another fold of the greater bag of the Fig. 524.—Plan of the peritoneum. peritoneum is pushed backwards to the spine between the small intestines and the pelvic viscera. This fold forms the lower layer of the mesentery, covers a considerable portion of the lower part of the abdominal wall, and passes over the sacro-vertebral angle into the pelvis. Below, where it covers the upper part of the pelvic viscera, it sends diverticula doivnwards between them, separating them from one another ; thus one is sent downwards between the back of the rectum and the sacrum, another between the rectum and the bladder. In the female, one is sent down between the rectum and uterus, another between the uterus and bladder. These, then, are the various diverticula sent off from the posterior layer of the greater bag of the peritoneum ; the anterior layer simply lines the anterior wall of the abdomen, and is continuous at its extremities with the posterior layer. The student will perhaps be better able to follow these various folds or reflections of the peritoneum by a reference to the accompanying plan (fig. 524), which should be studied in conjunction with fig. 523. He must not forget, however, that thoughORGANS OF DIGESTION 902 the lesser and greater cavities of the iDeritonenm are here represented, for the sake of clearness, as quite distinct from each other, they are not really so, but that they both form part of one great cavity. The reflections of the peritoneum may be traced in two different ways, either by considering the folds which form each cavity separately, or by describing them together. According to the first plan (fig. 523), the liver should be raised and supported in that position, and the stomach should be depressed, when a thin membranous layer is seen passing from the transverse fissure of the liver to the upper border of the stomach : this is the lesser or gastro-lieijatic omentum. It consists of two delicate layers of peritoneum, an anterior and a posterior, between which are contained the hepatic vessels and nerves. Of these two layers, the anterior should first be traced, and then the posterior. The anterior layer descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its anterior surface as far as the great curvature : it descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the external layer of the great omentum; it then covers the under surface of the transverse colon, and, passing to the back part of the abdominal cavity, forms the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then descends in front of the duodenum, the aorta, and vena cava, as far as the superior mesenteric artery, along which it passes to invest the small intestines, and, returning to the vertebral column, forms the mesentery ; whilst, on either side, it covers the ascending and descending colon, and is thus continuous with the peritoneum lining the walls of the abdomen. From the root of the mesentery it descends along the front of the spine into the pelvis, and surrounds the upper part of the rectum, which it holds in its position by means of a distinct fold, the meso-rectum. Its course in the male and female now differs. In the male it forms a fold between the rectum and bladder, the recto-vesical fold, and ascends over the posterior surface of the latter organ as far as its summit. In tJie female it descends into the pelvis in front of the rectum, forms a fold between the rectum and vagina, the recto-vaginal fold (pouch of Douglas), covers a small part of the posterior wall of the vagina, and passes on to the uterus, the fundus and body of which it covers. From the sides of the uterus it is reflected to the wall of the pelvis, forming the broad ligaments ; and from the anterior surface of the uterus it ascends upon the posterior wall of the bladder as far as its summit. From this point it may be traced, as in the male, ascending upon the anterior parietes of the abdomen, to the under surface of the Diaphragm ; from which it is reflected upon the liver, forming the upper layer of the coronary, and the lateral and longitudinal ligaments. It then covers the upper and under surfaces of the liver, and at the transverse fissure becomes continuous with the anterior layer of the lesser omentum, the point whence its reflection was originally traced. The posterior layer of the lesser omentum descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its posterior surface as far as the great curvature; it then descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the internal layer of the great omentum ; it covers the upper surface of the transverse colon, and, passing backwards to the spine, forms the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon. Ascending in front of the pancreas and crura of the Diaphragm, it lines the back part of the under surface of that muscle, from which it is reflected on to the posterior border of the liver, forming the inferior layer of the coronary ligament. From the under surface of the liver it may be traced to the transverse fissure, where it is continuous with the posterior layer of the lesser omentum, the point whence its reflection was originally traced. The space included in the reflections of this layer of the peritoneum is called the lesser cavity of the i^ieritoneum, or cavity of the great omentum. It is bounded, in front, by the lesser omentum, the stomach, and the descending part of the greatTHE PERITONEUM Above the transverse colon (fig. 525) the peritoneum can be traced, forming omentum ; behind, by the ascending part of the great omentum; the transverse colon, transverse meso-colon, and its ascending layer ; above, by the liver ; and beloiv, by the folding of the great omentum. This space communicates with the general peritoneal cavity through the foramen of Winslow, which is situated behind the right, or free border of the lesser omentum. In order to trace the two layers together, we commence at the top of the abdominal cavity ; that is to say, the under surface of the Diaphragm. This muscle is covered throughout the greater part of its extent by peritoneum; one layer extending from its anterior border, backwards ; the other from its posterior border, forwards. Where the two layers meet they are reflected downwards to the liver, forming the coronary and lateral ligaments of this organ. When these two layers reach the liver, they again separate to enclose this viscus, the one passing in front and the other behind, and they meet again on its under surface at the transverse fissure. From this fissure they turn downwards to the lesser curvature of the stomach, forming the gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum, and enclosing the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the hepatic duct, which are contained between the two folds in this situation. From the lesser curvature of the stomach, the two layers pass over the anterior and posterior surfaces of the viscus, enclosing it and meeting again at the greater curvature. From this point they pass down in front of the small intestines, between this tube and the abdominal wall, and are reflected on themselves, passing upwards to the transverse colon, and forming the apron or great omentum. This reflection, therefore, consists of four layers of peritoneum. When the two posterior layers of the great omentum, in their reflection upwards, reach the transverse colon, they separate to enclose this portion of the intestinal tube, the one layer passing above it and the other below. They meet on its posterior surface, and pass backwards to the vertebral column, forming what is called the transverse meso-colon. At this point the two layers separate. The one which formed the upper surface of the transverse meso-colon, and which belongs to the lesser cavity, passes upwards in front of the pancreas and crura of the Diaphragm to the back part of the under surface of the Diaphragm, the point from which the description of this layer was commenced. The other, which formed the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon, turns downwards in front of the duodenum, aorta, and inferior vena cava, and can be traced, as a single layer, in the manner above described, investing the small intestines and forming the mesentery ; then passing over the sacro-vertebral angle into the pelvis, the viscera of which it partially invests, and finally over the posterior surface of the front wall of the abdomen to the under surface of the Diaphragm, the point from which the description of this layer was commenced. In addition to tracing the peritoneum vertically, as has now been done, it is necessary to trace it horizontally. If this is done below the transverse colon, the circle is extremely simple, as it includes only the greater bag of the peritoneum (fig. 523). Above the level of the transverse colon the arrangement is more complicated, on account of the existence of two sacs. Starting from the linea alba, below the level of the transverse colon, and tracing the continuity in a horizontal direction to the right, we find the peritoneum covering the internal surface of the abdominal wall almost as far as the anterior border of the Quadratus lumborum muscle ; it encloses the csecum, forming the meso-caecum, and is reflected over the sides and anterior surface of the ascending colon, fixing it to the abdominal wall, thus forming the meso-cgecum and the ascending meso-colon, from which it can be traced over the kidney to the front of the bodies of the vertebrae. It then passes along the mesenteric vessels to invest the small intestines, and back again to the spine, forming the mesentery, between the layers of which are contained the blood-vessels, nerves, lacteals, and glands. Lastly, it passes over the left kidney to the sides and anterior surface of the descending colon, and, reaching the abdominal wall, it passes along it to the middle line of the abdomen.ORGANS OF DIGESTION the greater and lesser cavities, and their communication through the foramen of Winslow can be demonstrated. Commencing in the middle hne of the abdomen, the membrane may be traced Hning its anterior wall, and on the right side sending a process backwards to encircle the obliterated umbilical vein (the round ligament of the liver), forming the falciform or longitudinal ligament of the liver. Con- tinuing its course to the right, it is reflected over the front of the upper part of the right kidney, across the vena cava inferior and aorta, and over the left kidney to the hilum of the spleen. From this point it is reflected on to the posterior surface of the stomach, which it covers, and from its right extremity it passes around the vessels passing to the transverse fissure of the liver, and back again to the stomach, as the lesser omentum, and thus it forms the anterior boundary of the foramen of Winslow. It now covers the front of the stomach, and upon reaching the cardiac extremity it passes to the spleen, which it encloses, forming the gastro- splenic omentum. From the hilum of the spleen it turns backwards to reach the abdominal wall, along which it courses to reach the median line of the abdomen. The foramen of Winslow is bounded, in fi^ont, hy the lesser omentum, enclosing Fig. 525.—Transverse section of peritoneum. (An arrow has been introduced into the foramen of Winslow.) LE.SSER HE.PATIC ARTERY; CRUR/N OF DIAPHRAGM the vena portge and the hepatic artery and duct; heliind, by the inferior vena cava; above, by the lobulus Spigelii and lobulus caudatus ; heloiv, by the hepatic artery curving forwards from the coeliac axis. The reflections of the peritoneum over the transverse colon are somewhat differently described by some authors (Luschka, Holden), and there is no doubt, as was long ago pointed out by Haller, that the arrangement in the foetus is different from that which has been described above. In the foetus, and even in the young child, the two ascending layers of the great omentum can be traced passing together over the transverse colon, instead of embracing it, as described above, and passing back to the spine as a double fold, which can be separated from the transverse colon and transverse meso-colon. Upon reaching the spine the two layers separate : the upper one (the inner of the two ascending layers of the great omentum) passes upwards in front of the pancreas and crura of the Diaphragm, forming the posterior boundary of the lesser bag of the peritoneum, in a similar manner to the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon in the former description. The other fold (the outer of the ascending layer of the great omentum), after reaching the spine, is urned forwards again on itself as far as the transverse colon, which it covers, andTHE PERITONEUM is again reflected back to the spine, to pass down in front of the aorta to form the mesentery, in a similar manner to the lower layer of the transverse meso-colon in the former description. Thus the transverse colon is invested by a distinct fold of peritoneum, prolonged forwards from the spine to smTound it, in a very similar manner to the way in which the small intestines are surrounded. In the adult, however, as a rule, this arrangement disappears. Probably adhesion of the layers of which the fcetal duplication is composed takes place, and then absorption, and thus the arrangement is brought about which has been described above as most frequently seen in the adult subject. It may be that the foetal duplicature is ' drawn or pushed forwards from its place in the progress of visceral development, and thus effaced.' * Viscera covered by 'peritoneum.—The viscera thus shown to be almost entirely invested by peritoneum are, the liver, stomach, spleen, first portion of the duodenum, the jejunum and ileum, the transverse colon, the caecum, sigmoid flexure, upper half of the rectum, the uterus, and ovaries. Viscera partially covered by ijeritoneum.—The viscera only partially invested by peritoneum are, the descending and transverse portions of the duodenum, the ascending and descending colon, the middle portion of the rectum, and the upper part of the vagina and posterior wall of the bladder. The kidneys, suprarenal capsules, and pancreas are covered by the membrane without receiving any special investment from it. Viscera micovered by peritoneum.— The lower end of the rectum, the neck, base, and anterior surface of the bladder, the whole of the front, and the lower part of the posterior wall of the vagina, have no peritoneal covering. Numerous folds are formed by the peritoneum, extending between the various organs. These serve to hold them in position, and, at the same time, enclose the vessels and nerves proceeding to each part. Some of the folds are called ligavients, from their serving to support the organs in position. Others, which connect certain parts of the intestine with the abdominal wall, constitute the mesenteries ; and lastly, those which proceed from the stomach to certain viscera in its neighbourhood are called OJiienta. The Ligaments, formed by folds of the peritoneum, include those of the liver, spleen, bladder, and uterus. They will be found described with their respective organs. The Omenta are, the lesser omentum, the great omentum, and the gastro-splenic omentum. The lesser omentum (g astro-hepatic) is the duplicature which extends between the transverse fissure of the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach. It is extremely thin, and consists of two layers of peritoneum. At the left border its two layers pass on to the end of the oesophagus; but at the right border, where it is free, they are continuous, and form a free rounded margin, which contains between its layers the hepatic artery, the common bile-duct, the portal vein, lymphatics, and the hepatic plexus of nerves—all these structures being enclosed in loose areolar tissue, called Glisson's capsule. Between the layers where they are attached to the stomach lie the gastric artery and the pyloric branch of the hepatic, anastomosing with it. The great omentum (gastro-colic) is the largest peritoneal fold. It consists of four layers of peritoneum, two of which descend from the stomach, one from its anterior, the other from its posterior surface, and, uniting at its lower border, descend in front of the small intestines, as low down as the pelvis; they then turn upon themselves, and ascend again as far as the transverse colon, where they separate and enclose that part of the intestine. These separate layers may be easily demonstrated in the young subject, but in the adult they are more or less inseparably blended. The left border of the great omentum is continuous with the gastro-splenic omentum; its right border extends as far only as the duodenum. The great omentum is usually thin, presents a cribriform appearance, and always * Quain's Anatomy, vol. ii. p. 485, 8th ed.OKGANS OF DIGESTION contains some adipose tissue, which in fat subjects accumulates in considerable quantity. Its use appears to be to j^rotect the intestines from the cold, and to facilitate their movement upon each other during their vermicular action. Between its two anterior layers is the anastomosis between the right and left gastro-epiploica arteries. The gastro-s])lenic omentum is the fold which connects the concave surface of the spleen to the cul-de-sac of the stomach, being continuous by its lower border with the great omentum. It contains the splenic vessels and vasa brevia. Fig. 526.—Diagram devised by Dr. Delepine to show the lines along which the peritoneum leaves the wall of the abdomen to invest the viscera.

The mesentery (/xeVoi/, eVrepov), so called from being connected to the middle of the cylinder of the small intestine, is the broad fold of peritoneum which connects the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum with the posterior wall of the abdomen. Its root, the part connected with the vertebral column, is narrow, about six inchesTHE STOMACH 907 in length, and directed obliquely from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right sacro-iliac symphysis (fig. 526). Its intestinal border is much longer ; and here its two layers separate, so as to enclose the intestine, and form its peri- toneal coat. Its breadth, between its vertebral and intestinal border, is about four inches. Its upper border is continuous with the under surface of the transverse meso-colon; its loioer border, with the peritoneum covering the caecum and ascending colon. It serves to retain the small intestines in their position, and contains between its layers the mesenteric vessels and nerves, the lacteal vessels, and mesenteric glands. The meso-ccBcum serves to connect the back part of the caecum with the pos- terior wall of the abdomen, being continuous with the ascending meso-colon. The ascending meso-colon is the fold which connects the back part of the ascending colon with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; and the descending meso- colon retains the descending colon in connection with the posterior abdominal wall; more frequently the peritoneum merely covers the anterior surface and sides of these two portions of the intestine. At the place where the transverse colon turns downwards to form the descending colon, a fold of peritoneum is continued upwards to the under surface of the Diaphragm opposite the tenth and eleventh ribs. This is the costo-colic ligament; it passes below the spleen, and serves to support this organ and prevent it moving. The transverse meso-colon is a broad fold, which connects the transverse colon to the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is formed by the two ascending layers of the great omentum, which, after separating to surround the transverse colon, join behind it, and are continued backwards to the spine, where they diverge in front of the duodenum. This fold contains between its layers the vessels which supply the transverse colon. The sigmoid meso-colon is the fold of peritoneum which retains the sigmoid flexure in connection with the left iliac fossa. The meso-rectum is the narrow fold which connects the upper part of the rectum with the front of the sacrum. It contains the superior hgemorrhoidal vessels. The appendices epiploicce are small pouches of the peritoneum filled with fat, and situated along the colon and upper part of the rectum. They are chiefly appended to the transverse colon. The Stomach 527.^Diagrammatic outline of the stomach. The Stomach is the principal organ of digestion. It is the most dilated part of the alimentary canal. Its form is irregularly conical, curved upon itself, and presenting a rounded base, turned to the left side. It is placed, in part, immediately behind ^the anterior wall of the abdomen, and, in part, beneath the liver and Diaphragm and above the transverse colon. It is placed" almost 'Fig. vertically in the abdomen, so that the fundus which projects upwards and to the left of the oesophageal opening touches the Diaphragm, while the pyloric or lesser extremity is directed downwards and to the right, so that the opening by which the stomach communicates with the small intestine is situated slightly to the right of the median line of the body (fig. 527) : the stomach is situated, therefore, for the most part, in the left hypochondriac region ; the pyloric extremity occupying, however, the epigastric region. Its size varies considerably in difterent subjects, and also according to its state of distension. When moderately full its vertical diameter is about twelve inches, its transverse diameter about four. Its weight. ■ cuTde-sac9o8 . ORCVANS OF DIGESTION ^ according to Clendenning, is about four ounces and a half. It presents for exai:aii^a- tion two extremities, two orifices, two borders, and two surfaces. Its 2ipper extremity is called the gi'eater or splenic end. This is the largest part of the stomach, and extends two or three inches to the left of the point of entrance of the oesophagus. This expanded part is called the great cul-de-sac, or fundus. It lies behind the lower ribs, in contact with the Diaphragm, and is connected posteriorly to the spleen by the gastro-splenic omentum. The lesser or pyloric end is much smaller than the fundus, and situated on a plane anterior and inferior to it. It lies in contact with the wall of the abdomen, and the under surface of the liver. Its position on the surface of the body varies with the degree of distension of the organ. Near the pyloric end there is a double bend in the stomach, attended by an appearance of constriction, The distal bend corresponds to the situation of the pyloric valve, and between the two there is a bulging which is named the lesser cul-de-sac or antrimi pylori. The esophageal or cardiac orifice communicates with the oesophagus ; it is somewhat funnel-shaped. The pyloric orifice communicates with the duodenum, the aperture being guarded by a kind of valve—the pylorus. The lesser citrvature extends between the oesophageal and pyloric orifices, along the right border of the organ, and is connected to the under surface of the liver by the lesser omentum. The greater curvature extends between the same two points, along the left border, and gives attachment to the great omentum. The surfaces of the organ are limited by these two curvatures. The anterior surface is directed upwards and forwards, and is in relation with the Diaphragm, the under surface of the left lobe of the liver, and with the abdominal parietes. The posterior surface is directed downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the spleen, the pancreas, the left kidney and suprarenal capsule, and the transverse meso-colon. The stomach is held in position by the lesser omentum, which extends from the transverse fissure of the liver to its lesser curvature, and by a fold of peritoneum, Avhich passes from the Diaphragm on to the oesophageal end of the stomach, the gastro-phrenic ligament : this constitutes the most fixed point of the stomach, whilst the pyloric end and greater curvature are the most movable parts. To its greater curvature is attached the great omentum, by which it is connected to the transverse colon. Alterations in Position.—There is no organ in the body the position and connections of which present such frequent alterations as the stomatih.- Dm'ing inspiration it is displaced downwards by the descent of the Diaphragm, and elevatecWby the pressure of the abdominal muscles during expiration. Its position m relation to the surrounding viscera is also changed according to the empty,or distended state of the organ. When empty, it lies at the back part of the abdOmen,'Sonie distalice froAi the-'surface. The left lobe of the liver covers it in front, and the under surface of the heart rests upon it above and in front, being separated from it by the left lobe of the liver, besides the Diaphragm and pericardium. This close relation between the stomach and the heart explains the fact that, in gastralgia, the pain is generally referred to the heart, and is often accompanied by palpitation and intermipsion of the pulse. When the stomach is distended, the greater curvature is elevated and carried forwards, so that the anterior surface is turned upwards and the posterior surface downwards, and the stomach brought well against the anterior wall of the abdomen.* The Diaphraj^m at the same time is forced upwards, contracting the cavity of the chest; hence the dyspnoea complained of, from inspiration being impeded. The heart is also displaced upwards ; hence the oppression m this region, and the palpitation experienced in extreme distension of the stomach. Pressure from ivithout, as from tight lacing, pushes the stomach down towards the pelvis. In disease, also, the position and connections of the organ may be greatly changed, from the accumulation of fluid in the chest or abdomen, or from alteration in size of any of the surrounding viscera. * This is denied by Dr. Lesshaft, of St. Petersburg, who states that ' if the stomach is enlarged, no one part can be alone displaced, but all parts are equally moved by the distension.'—Lancet, March ii, 1882, p. 406.909 THE STOMACH On looking into the pyloric end of the stomach, the mucous membrane is found projecting inwards in the form of a circular fold, the pylorus, leaving a narrow circular aperture, about half an inch in diameter, by which the stomach communi- cates with the duodenum. The pylorus is formed by a reduplication of the mucous membrane of the stomach, containing numerous muscular fibres, which are aggregated into a thick circular ring; the longitudinal fibres and serous membrane being continued over the fold without assisting in its formation. The aperture is occasionally oval. Sometimes the circular fold is replaced by two crescentic folds, placed one above and the other below the pyloric orifice : and more rarely there is only one crescentic fold. Structure.—The stomach consists of four coats : serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous, together with vessels and nerves. Fig. 528.—The mucous membrane of the stomach and duodenum with the bile ducts. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum, and covers the entire surface of the organ, excepting along the greater and lesser curvatures, at the points of attachment of the greater and lesser omenta ; here the two layers of peritoneum leave a small triangular space, along which the nutrient vessels and nerves pass. The viuscular coat (fig. 529) is situated immediately beneath the serous covering. It consists of three sets of fibres—longitudinal, circular, and oblique. The longitudinal fibres are most superficial; they are continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, radiating in a stellate manner from the cardiac orifice. They are most distinct along the curvatures, especially the lesser, but are very thinly distributed over the surfaces. At the pyloric end they are more thickly distributed, and continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the small intestine. The circular fibres form a uniform layer over the whole extent of the stomachORGANS OF DIGESTION support the epithelium. The pyloric glands (fig. 530) are most numerous at the 9IO beneath the longitudinal fibres. At the jDylorns they are most abundant, and are aggregated.into a circular ring, which projects into the cavity, and forms, with the fold of mucous membrane covering its surface, the lyyloric valve. The oblique fibres are limited chiefly to the cardiac end of the stomach, where they are disposed as a thick uniform layer, covering both surfaces, some passing obliquely from left to right, others from right to left, round the cardiac end. They are continuous with the circular fibres of the oesophagus. The areolar coat consists of a loose, filamentous, areolar tissue, connecting the mucous and muscular layers. It is sometimes called the submucous coat. It supports the blood-vessels previous to their distribution to the mucous membrane : hence it is sometimes called the vascular coat. The mucous membrane is thick; its surface smooth, soft, and velvety. In the fresh state it is of a pinkish tinge at the pyloric end, and of a red or reddish-brown colour over the rest of its surface. In infancy it is of a brighter hue, the vascular redness being more marked. It is thin at the cardiac extremity, but thicker towards the pylorus. During the contracted state of the organ it is thrown into numerous Fig. 529.—The muscular coat of the stomach. plaits or rugs, which, for the most part, have a longitudinal direction, and are most marked towards the lesser end of the stomach, and along the greater cur- vature (fig. 528). These folds are entirely obhterated when the organ becomes distended. StriLcture of the Mucous Membrane.—When examined with a lens, the inner surface of the mucous membrane presents a peculiar honeycomb appearance from being covered with small shallow depressions or alveoli, of a polygonal or hexagonal form, which vary from -^^^ to of "i^h in diameter, and are separated by sUghtly elevated ridges. In the bottom of the alveoli are seen the orifices of minute tubes, the gastric follicles, which are situated perpen- dicularly side by side throughout the entire substance of the mucous membrane. The gastric follicles are of two kinds, which differ from each other in structure, and it is believed also in the nature of their secretion. They are named respectively pyloric &nd peptic glands. They are both tubular in character, and are formed of a delicate basement membrane, supporting epithelium. The basement membrane consists of flattened transparent endothelial cells, with processes which extend andTHE STOMACH 911 pyloric end of the stomach, and from this fact have received their name. They were formerly ternled mucous glands, and were supposed to secrete mucus ; but, as Klein points out, ' the cells are serous, not mucous, and the secretion of the glands cannot therefore be mucus.' They consist of two or three short, closed tubes opening into a common duct, the external orifice of which is situated at the bottom of an alveolus. The caecal tubes are wavy, and are of about equal length with the duct. The tubes and duct are lined throughout with epithelium, the duct being lined by columnar cells, continuous with the epithelium lining the surface of the mucous membrane of the stomach, the tubes with shorter and more cubical cells which are finely granular. The peptic glands (fig. 531) are found all over the surface of the stomach. Like the pyloric glands they consist of a duct, into which open two or more cffical tubes. The duct, however, in these glands is shorter than in the other variety, sometimes not amounting to more than one-sixth of the whole length of the gland; it is lined throughout by columnar epithelium. At the point where the terminal tubes open into the duct, and which is termed the neck, the epithe- lium alters, the cells becoming much shorter and opaque : the lumen also becomes Fig. 530.—Pyloric gland. Fig. 531.—Peptic gastric gland. suddenly constricted, and is continued down to the bottom of the tubes as a very fine channel. Here also are found, between the epithelium and the basement membrane, la-rge spheroidal, coarsely granular cells, which were formerly termed peptic cells, and which produce an outward bulging of the basement membrane. They are seen throughout the remainder of the tube at intervals, and give it a beaded or varicose appearance. Below the neck, the terminal tubes, in addition to these isolated spheroidal cells, are occupied with finely granular, angular cells (columnar, Klein) leaving only a small channel in the centre. They are continuous with the short columnar cells of the neck, and are termed the central or chief cells, because they are believed to be principally concerned in the secretion of the gastric juice. The peptic cells, which were formerly supposed" to possess this office, are now termed parietal or oxyntic cells. Between the glands the mucous membrane consists of a connective-tissue framework, with lymphoid tissue. In places, thisORGANS OF DIGESTION 912 latter tissue, especially in early life, is collected into little masses, which to a certain extent resemble the solitary glands of the intestine, and are by some termed the lenticular glands of the stomach. They are not, however, so distinctly circum- scribed as the solitary glands. The epithelium lining the mucous membrane of the stomach and its alveoli is of the columnar variety. Beneath the mucous membrane, and between it and the submucous coat, is a thin stratum of involuntary muscular fibre {muscularis mitcoscs), which in some parts consists only of a single longitudinal layer ; in others, of two layers, an inner, circular, and an outer, longitudinal. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the stomach are : the gastric, the pyloric and right gastro-epiploic branches of the hepatic, the left gastro-epiploic and vasa brevia from the splenic. They supply the muscular coat, ramify in the submucous coat, and are finally distributed to the mucous membrane. The arrangement of the vessels in the mucous membrane is somewhat peculiar. The arteries break up at the base of the gastric tubules into a plexus of fine capillaries Avhich run upwards between the tubules, anastomosing with each other, and ending in a plexus of larger capillaries, which surround the mouths of the tubes, and also form hexagonal meshes around the alveoli. From these latter the veins arise, and pursue a straight course backwards, between the tubules, to the submucous tissue, and terminate either in the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, or directly in the portal vein. The lymphatics are numerous ; they consist of a superficial and deep set, which pass through the lymphatic glands found along the two curvatures of the organ. The nerves are the terminal branches of the right and left pneumo- gastric, the former being distributed upon the back, and the latter upon the front part of the organ. A great number of branches from the sympathetic also supply the organ. Surface Form.—The stomach lies for the most part in the left hypochondriac region, but also slightly in the epigastric region, and is partly in contact with the abdominal wall, partly under cover of the lower ribs on the left side, and partly under the left lobe of the liver. Its cardiac orifice is behind the seventh costal cartilage of the left side, about one inch from its junction with the sternimi, on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra. The pyloric orifice is in a vertical line drawn from the right border of the sternum, two and a half or three inches below the level of the sterno-xiphoid articulation. According to Braune, when the stomach is distended, the pylorus moves considerably to the right, as much sometimes as three inches. The lesser curvature of the stomach is represented by a curved line with its convexity downwards from the cardiac to the pyloric extremities; the greater curvature by a similarly curved line between the same points, but with a curve of much greater extent, so that its lowest point reaches a horizontal line drawn between the tips of the tenth costal cartilages. The fundus of the stomach reaches, on the left side, as high as the level of the sixth chondro-sternal articulation, being a little below and behind the apex of the heart. The portion of the stomach which is in contact with the abdominal walls, and is therefore accessible for opening in the operations of gastrotomy and gastrostomy, is represented by a triangular space, the base of which is formed by a line drawn from the tip of the tenth costal cartilage on the left side to the tip of the ninth costal cartilage on the right, and the sides by two lines drawn from the extremity of the eighth costal cartilage on the left side to the ends of the base line. Surgical Anatoviy.—Operations on the stomach are frequently performed. By ' gastrotomy' is meant an incision into the stomach for the removal of a foreign body, the opening being immediately afterwards closed—in contradistinction to ' gastrostomy,' the making of a more or less permanent fistulous opening. Gastrotomy is probably best performed by an incision in the linea alba, especially if the forei^jn body is large, by a cut from the ensiform cartilage to the umbilicus; but may be performed by an incision over the body itself, where this can be felt, or by one of the incisions for gastrostomy, to be mentioned immediately. The peritoneal cavity is opened, and the point at which the stomach is to be incised decided upon. This portion is tlien brought out of the abdominal wound and sponges carefully packed around. The stomach is now opened by a transverse incision and the foreign body extracted. The wound in the stomach is then closed by Lembert's sutures, i.e. by sutures passed through the peritoneal and muscular coats in such a way that the peritoneal surfaces on each side of the wound are brought into apposition, and in this way the wound is closed. Gastrostomy is performed in two stages. The first stage consists in opening the peritoneal cavity and stitching the stomach to the abdominal wall. The second stage consists in opening the stomach, after a few days have elapsed, and adhesions formed between the peritoneal surfaces of the stomach and abdominal wall. The operation is usually performed by an oblique incision, aboutTHE SMALL INTESTINE 913 one finger's breadth below and parallel with the margin of the left costal cartilages, commencing an inch and a half from the median line and being about three inches in length. Some surgeons prefer a straight incision, beginning opposite to the end of the eighth intercostal space, and passing down for three inches over the Rectus abdominis muscle. The skin, fasciae, and muscles are to be severally divided down to the peritoneum. Howse recommends that the sheath of the Rectus should be opened longitudinally and the fibres of this muscle separated, and not cut, in the same direction, so as to secure a sphincter-like action around the opening. After the peritoneum has been opened, the stomach is recognised by its pink red colour and smooth surface. It is to be pulled up into the wound and sutured to the opening. This may be done in several ways, but in whatever way it is done the following points should be carefully a.ttended to. (i) In taking up the stomach, only to pass the needle through the serous and muscular coats, and avoid puncturing the mucous membrane. (2) To take up plenty of the muscular coat. (3) In passing the needle through the parietes of the abdomen, to be careful to include the parietal peritoneimi. (4) To enclose a circle of the stomach at least an inch in diameter. If the symptoms admit of it, the parts are now to be left quiet for four or five days, and a small puncture is then to be made through the exposed portion of the stomach and a gum elastic catheter passed through it into the viscus, through which fluid can be injected, in small quantities at first. In more urgent cases it may be necessary to make the opening much earlier. Excision of the pylorus has occasionally been performed, but the results of this opera- tion are by no means favourable, and, in cases of cancer of the pylorus, gastro-enterostomy is generally preferred. The object of this operation is to make a fistulous communication between the stomach, on the cardiac side of the disease, and the small intestine, as high up as is possible. The Small Intestine The small intestine is a convoluted tube, about twenty feet in length,* which gradually diminishes in size from its commencement to its termination. It is contained in the central and lower parts of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, surrounded above and at the sides by the large intestine ; it is in relation, in front, with the great omentum and abdominal parietes ; and connected to the spine by a fold of peritoneum, the mesentery. The small intestine is divisible into three portions—the duodenum, the jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum has received its name from being about equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers (eight or ten inches). It is the shortest, the widest, and the most fixed part of the small intestine ; it has no mesentery, and is only partially covered by the peritoneum. Its course presents a remarkable curve, somewhat like a horsehoe in form ; the convexity being directed towards the right, and the concavity to the left, embracing the head of the pancreas. Commencing at the pylorus, it -passes obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the right, to the under surface of the liver ; it then descends in front of the right kidney, and passes nearly transversely across the front of the spine, terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. Hence the duodenum has been divided into three portions—ascending, descending, and transverse. The first, or ascending portion (fig. 532), about two inches in length, is free, movable, and nearly completely invested by the peritoneum, which forms the lesser omentum. It is in relation, above and in front, with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder ; behind, with the vessels which run between the layers of the lesser omentum, viz. the hepatic artery and duct, and vena portae. This portion of the intestine is usually found, after death, stained with bile, especially on its anterior surface. The second, or descending portion, about three inches in length, is firmly fixed by the peritoneum and pancreas. It passes from the neck of the gall-bladder vertically downwards, in front of the right kidney, as far as the third lumbar vertebra. It is covered by peritoneum only on its anterior surface. It is in relation, in front, with the right arch of the colon'and the meso-colon ; behind, with * Treves states that, in one hundred cases, the average length of the small intestine in the adult male was 22 feet 6 inches, and in the adult female 23 feet 4 inches: but that it varies very much, the extremes in the male being 31 feet 10 inches in one case, and 15 feet 6 inches in another, a difference of over 15 feet. He states that he has convinced himself that the length of the bowel is independent, in the adult, of age, height, and weight. 3Nc,i4 ORGANS OF DIGESTION the front of the right kidney ; at its inner side is the head of the pancreas, and the ductus communis choledochus. The common bile-duct and the pancreatic duct perforate the inner side of this portion of the intestine obhquely, a httle below its middle. The third, or transverse portion, the longest and narrowest part of the duo- denum, passes across the front of the spine, ascending from the third to the second lumbar vertebra, and terminating in the jejunum on the left side of the latter bone. In front, though at some distance from it, is the descending layer of the transverse meso-colon, or the divergence of the two layers of that structure, and it is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels ; behind, it rests upon the aorta, the vena cava inferior, and the crura of the Diaphragm; above it is the lower border of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vessels passing forwards between the two. The point of junction of the duodenum and jejunum is said to correspond to the spot where the gut receives a complete investment of peritoneum. From this point a fairly constant portion, about an inch in length, ascends on the left side of the vertebral column, and is by some regarded as a fourth part of the duodenum. This portion is fixed in this position by a band which extends upwards from it, obliquely across the aorta to the connective tissue around the coeliac axis and the915 THE SMALL INTESTINE left cms of the Diaphragm, and is termed the musculus sicspensorius duodeni, from possessing, according to Treitz, plain muscular fibres, mixed with the fibrous tissue of which it is principally made up. Vessels and Nerves,—The arteries supplying the duodenum are the pyloric and pancreatico-duodenal branches of the hepatic, and the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. The veins terminate in the splenic and superior mesenteric. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The jejunum {jejimus, empty), so called from being usually found empty after death, includes the upper two-fifths of the small intestine below the duodenum. It commences at the duodenum on the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, and terminates in the ileum; its convolutions being chiefly confined to the umbilical and left iliac regions. The jejunum is wider, its coats thicker, more vascular, and of a deeper colour than those of the ileum ; but there is no character- istic mark to distinguish the termination of the one and the commencement of the other. The ileum (elXelv, to twist), so called from its numerous coils or convolutions, includes the remaining three-fifths of the small intestine. It occupies chiefly the umbilical, hypogastric, right iliac, and occasionally the pelvic regions, and termi- nates in the right iliac fossa by opening into the inner side of the commencement of the large intestine. The ileum is narrower, its coats thinner and less vascular than those of the jejunum ; a given length of it weighing less than the same length of the jejunum. Meckel's diverticulum.—Occasionally there may be found connected with the lower part of the ileum, from one to three feet from its termination, a blind diverticulum or tube, varying in length. It is attached to and communicates with the free margin of the bowel by one extremity, and by the other is unattached or may be connected with the abdominal wall or some other portion of the intestine by a fibrous band. This is Meckel's diverticulum, and represents the remains of the vitelline duct, or duct of communication between the umbilical vesicle and the alimentary canal (see page 77). Structure.—The wall of the small intestine is composed of four coats—serous muscular, areolar, and mucous. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum. The first or ascending portion of the duodenum is almost completely surrounded by that membrane ; the second or descending portion is covered by it only in front ; and the third or transverse portion lies behind the descending layer of the transverse meso-colon, which passes over it, without being closely incorporated with the other coats of this part of the intestine. The remaining portion of the small intestine is sur- rounded by the peritoneum, excepting along its attached or mesenteric border ; here a space is left for the vessels and nerves to pass to the gut. The muscidar coat consists of two layers of fibres, an external or longitudinal, and an internal or circular layer. The longitudinal fibres are thinly scattered over the surface of the intestine, and are more distinct along its free border. The circular fibres form a thick, uniform layer ; they surround the cylinder of the intestine in the greater part of its circumference, but do not form complete rings. The muscular coat is thicker at the upper than at the lower part of the small intestine. The areolar or submucous coat connects together the mucous and muscular layers. It consists of loose, filamentous areolar tissue, which forms a nidus for the subdivision of the nutrient vessels, previous to their distribution to the mucous surface. The mucous membrane is thick and highly vascular at the upper part of the small intestine, but somewhat paler and thinner below. It consists of the following- structures : next the areolar or submucous coat is a layer of unstriped muscular fibres, the muscularis mucosce ; internal to this is a quantity of retiform tissue, enclosing in its- meshes lymph-corpuscles, and in which the blood-vessels and nerves ramify. Lastly, a basement membrane, supporting a single layer of epithelial 3 N 2ORGANS OF DIGESTION gi6 cells, which throughout the intestines are columnar in character. They are granular in appearance, and possess a clear oval nucleus. At their superficial or unattached end they present a distinct layer of highly refracting material, marked by vertical striae, which were formerly believed to be minute channels, by which the chyle was taken up into the interior of the cell, and by them transferred to the lacteal vessels of the mucous membrane. The mucous membrane presents for examination the following structures, contained within it or belonging to it:— Valvulge conniventes. f Duodenal glands. Villi. Glands s Solitary glands.

The reticulum contains thickenings or ' nodal points.' The diagram shows that the cells of the upper part of the villus are larger and contain a larger zone of protoplasm than those of the lower part. The cells of the upper part of the chyle-vessel difirer somewhat from tliose of the loAver part, in that they more nearly resemble the cells of the parenchyma. the mucous membrane and submucous tissue. Unlike the folds in the stomach they are permanent, and are not obliterated when the intestine is distended. They extend transversely across the cylinder of the intestine for about one-half or two-thirds of its circumference. The larger folds are about two inches in. length, and one-third of an inch in depth at their broadest part; but the greater number are of smaller size. The larger and smaller folds alternate with each^ other. They are not found at the commencement of the duodenum, but begin t( appear about one or two inches beyond the pylorus. In the lower part of th( descending portion, below the point where the common choledic and pancreaticTHE SMALL INTESTINE 917 ducts enter the intestine, they are very large and closely approximated. In the transverse portion of the duodenum and upper half of the jejunum they are large and numerous; and from this point, down to the middle of the ileum, they diminish considerably in size. In the lower part of the ileum they almost entirely disappear ; hence the comparative thinness of this portion of the intestine, as compared with the duodenum and jejunum. The valvulae conniventes retard the passage of the food along the intestines, and afford a more extensive surface for absorption. The villi are minute, highly vascular processes, projecting from the mucous membrane of the small intestine throughout its whole extent, and giving to its surface a velvety appearance. In shape some are triangular and laminated, others conical or cylindrical, with clubbed or filiform extremities. They are largest and most numerous in the duodenum and jejunum, and become fewer and smaller in the ileum. Krause estimates their number in the upper part of the small intestine at from fifty to ninety in a square line ; and in the lower part Fig. 534.—Villi of small intestine. (Cadiat.) from forty to seventy ; the total number for the whole length of the intestine being about four millions. Structure of the villi (fig. 533).—The structure of the villi has been studied recently by many eminent anatomists. We shall here follow the description of Dr. Watney,* whose researches have a most important bearing on the physiology of that which is the peculiar function of this part of the intestine, the absorp- tion of fat. The essential parts of a villus are, the lacteal vessel, the blood-vessels, the epithelium, the basement membrane and muscular tissue of the mucosa, these structures being supported and held together by retiform lymphoid tissue. These structures are arranged in the following manner. Situated in the centre of the villus is the lacteal, terminating near the summit in a blind extremity ; running along this vessel are unstriped muscular fibres ; surrounding it is a plexus of capillary vessels, the whole being enclosed by a basement membrane, supporting columnar epithelium. Those structures which are contained within the basement membrane—namely, the lacteal, the muscular tissue, and the blood-vessels—are * Phil. Trans, vol. clxvi. pt. ii.ORGANS OF DIGESTION 9i8 surrounded and enclosed by a delicate reticulum which forms the matrix of the villus, and in the meshes of which are found large flattened cells, with an oval nucleus, and, in smaller numbers, lymph-corpuscles. These latter are to be distinguished from the larger cells of the villus by their behaviour with reagents, by their size, and by the shape of their nucleus, w^hich is spherical. Transitional forms, however, of all kinds are met with between the lymph-corpuscle and the proper cells of the villus. The lac teals are in some cases double, and in some animals multiple. Situated in the axis of the villi, they commence by dilated caecal extremities near to, but not quite at, the summit of the villus. The walls are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, the interstitial substance between the cells being continuous with the reticulum of the matrix. The miiscular fibres are derived from the muscu- laris mucosae, and are arranged in bundles around the lacteal vessel, extending from the base to the summit of the villus, and giving off, laterally, individual muscle-cells, which are enclosed by the reticulum, and by it are attached to the basement membrane. The blood-vessels form a plexus between the lacteal and the basement membrane, and are enclosed in the reticular tissue ; in the interstices of the capillary plexus, which they form, are contained the cells of the villus. These structures are surrounded by the basement membrane, which is made up of a stratum of endothelial cells, and upon which is placed a layer of columnar epithelium. The reticulum of the matrix is con- tinuous through the basement membrane (that is, through the interstitial substance between the individual endothelial cells) with the interstitial cement-substance of the columnar cells on the surface of the villus. Thus we are enabled to trace a direct continuity between the interior of the lacteal and the surface of the villus by means of the reticular tissue, and it is along this path that, according to Dr. Watney, the chyle passes in the process of absorption by the villi. That is to say, it passes through the interstitial substance between the epithelium cells, through the interstitial substance of the basement membrane, the reticulum of the matrix, and the interstitial substance between the endothelial plates of the lacteal. Fig. 536.—Longitudinal section of crypts of Lieberkiihn. Goblet-cells seen among the columnar epithelial cells. (Klein and Noble Smith.) all which structures have been shoAvn to be continuous with one another, and being probably semi-fluid do not offer any obstacle to the passage of the molecular basis of the chyle. The simple follicles, or crypts of Lieberkuhn (figs. 535, 536), are found in con- siderable numbers over every part of the mucous membrane of the small intestine. They consist of minute tubular depressions of the mucous membrane, arranged perpendicularly to the surface, upon which they open by small circular apertures. They may be seen with the aid of a lens, their orifices appearing as minute dots, scattered between the villi. Their walls are thin, consisting of a layer of base- ment membrane (which is, in fact, an endothelial membrane) lined by columnar epithelium, and covered on their exterior by capillary vessels.

(Klein and Noble Smith.)919 GLANDS OF SMALL INTESTINE Fig. 537.—Transverse section through the eciuatorial plane of three of Peyer's folhcles from the rabbit. Cajnllary netivorh The duodenal or Brunner's glands are limited to the duodenum and commence- ment of the jejunum. They are small, flattened, granular bodies, embedded in the submucous areolar tissue, and open upon the surface of the mucous membrane by minute excretory ducts. They are most numerous and largest near the pylorus. They may be compared to the elementary lobules of a salivary gland spread out over a broad surface, instead of being collected in a mass. They consist of a number of tubular alveoli, lined by epithelium and opening by a single duct on the inner surface of the in- testine. The solitary glands (cjlandulcB solitaries) are found scattered through- out the mucous membrane of the small intestine, but are most numerous in the lower part of the ileum. They are small, round, whitish bodies, from half a line to a line in diameter. Their free surface is covered with villi, and each gland is surrounded by the openings of the follicles of Lieberkiihn. They are now recognised as lymph- follicles, and consist of a dense inter- lacing retiform tissue, closely packed with lymph-corpuscles, and permeated with an abundant capillary network (fig. 537). The interspaces of the reti- form tissue are continuous with larger lymph-spaces at the base of the gland through which they communicate with the lacteal system. They are situated partly in the submucous tissue, partly in the mucous membrane, where they form slight projections of its epithelial layer, after having penetrated the muscularis mucosae. The villi which are situated on them are generally absent from the very summit (or ' cupola,' as Frey calls it) of the gland. Fig. 538.—Patch of Peyer's glands. From the lower part of the ileum. Fig. 539.--A portion of the above masrnified. \^\J Z'^:-^^ ;W .A' ■ .\' Peyer's glands (figs. 536 540) may be regarded as aggregations of solitary glands, forming circular or oval patches from twenty to thirty in number, and varying in length from half an inch to four inches. They are largest and most numerous in the ileum. In the lower part of the jejunum they are small, of a circular form, and few in number. They are occasionally seen in the duodenum.ORGANS OF DIGESTION 920 They are placed lengthwise in the intestine, covering the portion of the tube most distant from the attachment of the mesentery.

(Klein and Noble Smith.) of the above-described solitary glands covered with mucous membrane, and in almost every respect are similar in structure to them. They do not, however, as a rule, possess villi on their free surface. Each patch is surrounded by a circle ofTHE LAEGE INTESTINE the crypts of Lieberkdhn. They are best marked in the young subject, becoming indistinct in middle age, and sometimes altogether disappearing in advanced life. They are largely supplied with blood-vessels, which form an abundant plexus around each follicle, from which fine branches are given off which permeate the lymphoid tissue in the interior of the follicle. Vessels and Nerves.—The jejunum and ileum are sup]Dlied by the superior mesenteric artery, the branches of which, having reached the attached border of the bowel, run between the serous and muscular coats, with frequent inoscula- tions to the free border, where they also anastomose with other branches running round the opposite surface of the gut. From these vessels numerous branches are given off, which pierce the muscular coat, supplying it and forming an intricate plexus in the submucous tissue. From this plexus minute vessels pass to the glands and villi of the mucous membrane. The veins have a similar course and arrangement to the arteries. The lymphatics of the small intestine (lacteals) are arranged in two sets, those of the villi and those of the muscular coat. The lymphatics of the villi commence in these structures in the manner described above, and form an intricate plexus in the mucous and submucous tissue, being joined by the lymphatics from the lymph-spaces at the bases of the solitary glands (fig. 540), and. from this pass to larger vessels at the mesenteric border of the gut. The lymphatics of the muscular coats are situated to a great extent between the two layers of muscular fibres, where they form a close plexus, and throughout their course communicate freely with the lymphatics from the mucous membrane, and empty themselves in the same manner into the commencement of the lacteal vessels at the attached border of the gut. The nerves of the small intestine are derived from the plexuses of sympathetic nerves around the superior mesenteric artery. From this source they run to a plexus of nerves and ganglia situated between the circular and longitudinal muscular fibres (Auerbach's plexus) from which the nervous branches are distributed to the muscular coats of the intestine. From this plexus a secondary plexus is derived (Meissner's plexus), which is formed by branches which have perforated the circular muscular fibres (fig. 541). This plexus lies between the muscular and mucous coats of the intestine. It is also gangliated, and from it the ultimate fibres pass to the muscularis mucosae and to the mucous membrane. The Large Intestine The large intestine extends from the termination of the ileum to the anus. It is about five feet in length, being one-fifth of the whole extent of the intestinal canal. It is largest at its commencement at the caecum, and gradually diminishes as far as the rectum, where there is a dilatation of considerable size, just above the anus. It differs from the small intestine in its greater size, its more fixed position, and its sacculated form. The large intestine, in its course, describes an arch, which surrounds the convolutions of the small intestine. It commences in the right inguinal region, in a dilated part, the ccecum. It ascends through the right lumbar and hypochondriac regions to the under surface of the liver ; passes trans- versely across the abdomen on the confines of the epigastric and umbihcal regions, to the left hypochondriac region ; descends through the left lumbar region to the left iUac fossa, where it becomes convoluted, and forms the sigmoid flexure ; finally it enters the pelvis, and descends along its posterior wall to the anus. The large intestine is divided into the caecum, colon, and rectum. The csecum (csecus, blind) (fig. 542) is the large blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, in which the large intestine commences. It is the most dilated part of the tube, measuring about two and a half inches, both in its vertical and transverse diameters. Its position varies somewhat; usually it is found lying upon the Psoas muscle, and so placed that its apex or lowest point is just projecting beyond the inner border of that-muscle, corresponding to a point a little to the inner side of the middle of Poupart's ligament. Sometimes, however, it is situated externalORGANS OF DIGESTION 922 to this, in the right iliac fossa, in relation with the Iliacus muscle ; and at other times it lies internal to both Psoas and Iliacus, either resting on the pelvic brim, or altogether contained within the pelvis. It is entirely enveloped on all sides by peritoneum, which, after enclosing it, is reflected on to the posterior wall of the abdomen, being continuous with the ascending meso-colon, when this fold exists. The caecum, therefore, lies quite free in the abdominal cavity, and enjoys a considerable amount of movement. On its inner side it is joined by the ileum, while attached to its lower and back part is the appendix vermiformis. The appendix vermiformis is a long, narrow, worm-shaped tube, the rudiment of the lengthened ceecum found in nearly all the mammalia. The appendix varies from three to six inches in length, its average diameter being about equal to that of a goose-quill. It is usually directed upwards and inwards behind the caecum, coiled upon itself, and terminates in a blunt point ; being retained in its position by a fold of peritoneum, which sometimes forms a mesentery for it. Its canal is small, and communicates with the caecum by an orifice, which is placed below and behind that of the ileum. It is sometimes guarded with an incomplete valve formed of a fold of mucous membrane. Its Fig. 542.—The caecmn and colon laid coats are thick, and its mucous lining fur- open to show the ileo-caecal valve. nished with a large number of solitary glands. In the neighbourhood of the caecum, and especially in the vicinity of the ileo-caecal valve, are certain pouches of peritoneum or fossffi, which are of surgical importance. Three of these fossae have been described. The ileo-colic fossa (superior ileo-caecal) is situated at the junction of the ileum and colon, in the angle between the ascending colon which forms the outer boundary of the pouch, and the ileum which forms the lower boundary. Often a fold of peritoneum, arch- ing over a branch of the ileo-colic artery, i, roofs in this angle and thus forms a pouch, I the floor of which is formed by the mesen- ^7 tery. The ileo-ccecal fossa (inferior ileo- cecal) is situated behind the angle of junc- tion of the ileum and caecum. It is formed by a fold of peritoneum (ileo-ca?cal fold), which extends from the border of the ileum, and, passing over the ileo-caecal junction, joins the mesentery of the appendix. Be- tween this fold and the appendix is the fossa, which is bounded to the right by the ascending meso-colon, and to the left by the mesentery. It may extend a con- siderable distance upwards, behind and parallel with the colon. The suhccBcal fossa (retro-caecal) is situated immediately beneath the caecum, which has to be raised to bring it into view. It lies close to the ileo-caecal fossa, from which it is separated by the meso-caecum and ascending meso-colon. It is not so constant as either the ileo-caecal or ileo-colic fossae. Hernia of the vermiform appendix into one of these pouches frequently takes place, when it is often concealed and might escape the search of the surgeon were he not familiar with their existence. Moreover, a herniated appendix into one of these pouches is very liable to become strangulated. The presence of these pouches also explains the course which pus has been known to take in cases of perforation of the appendix, where it travels upwards behind the ascending colon as far as the Diaphragm.* Ileo-caecal valve.—The lower end of the ileum terminates at the inner and * On the anatomy of these fossi£, see a paper by Dr. RoMeston and Mr. Lock wood, Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxvi. p. 130.923 COLON back part of the large intestine, opposite the junction of the caecum with the colon. At this point the mucous membrane forms two valvular folds, w^hich project into the large intestine, and are separated from each other by a narrow elongated aperture. These folds form the ileo-caecal valve {valvula Bauhini). Each fold is semilunar in form. The upper one, nearly horizontal in direction, is attached by its convex border to the point of junction of the ileum with the colon ; the lower segment, to the point of junction of the ileum with the caecum. Their free concave margins project into the intestine, separated from one another by a narrow slit-like aperture, directed transversely. At each end of this aperture the two segments of the valve coalesce, and are continued as a narrow membranous ridge around the canal of the intestine for a short distance, forming the frcsna, or retinacula, of the valve. The left or anterior end of this aperture is rounded ; the right or posterior end is narrow and pointed. Each segment of the valve is formed by a reduplication of the mucous membrane and of the circular muscular fibres of the intestine, the longitudinal fibres and peritoneum being continued uninterruptedly across from one intestine to the other. When these are divided or removed, the ileum maybe drawn outwards, and all traces of the valve will be lost, the ileum appearing to open into the large intestine by a funnel-shaped orifice of large size. The surface of each segment of the valve directed towards the ileum is covered with villi, and presents the characteristic structure of the mucous membrane of the small intestine ; whilst that turned towards the large intestine is destitute of villi, and marked with the orifices of . the numerous tubular glands peculiar to the membrane in the large intestine. These differences in structure continue as far as the free margin of the valve. When the caecum is distended, the margins of the opening are approximated, so as to prevent any reflux into the ileum. The colon is divided into four parts—the ascending, transverse, descending, and the sigmoid flexure. The ascending colon is smaller than the caecum. It passes upwards, from its commencement at the caecum, opposite the ileo-caecal valve, to the under surface of the liver, on the right of the gall-bladder, where it bends abruptly inwards to the left, forming the hepatic flexure. It is retained in contact with the posterior wall of the abdomen by the peritoneum, which covers its anterior surface and sides, its posterior surface being connected by loose areolar tissue with the Quadratus lumborum, right kidney, and descending portion of the duodenum (figs. 543, 544) : sometimes the peritoneum almost completely invests it, and forms a distinct but narrow meso-colon.* It is in relation, in front, wdth the convolutions of the ileum and the abdominal parietes ; behind, it lies on the Quadratus lumborum muscle and right kidney and descending portion of the duodenum. The transverse colon, the longest part of the large intestine, passes trans- versely from right to left across the abdomen, opposite the confines of the epigastric and umbilical zones, into the left hypochondriac region, where it curves downwards beneath the lower end of the s]Dleen, forming the si:)leniG flexure. In its course it describes an arch, the concavity of which is directed backwards towards the vertebral column ; hence the name transverse arch of the colon. This is the most movable part of the colon, being almost completely invested by peritoneum, and connected to the spine behind by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane, the transverse meso-colon. It is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver * Mr. Treves states that, after a careful examination of one hundred subjects, he found thai in fifty-two there was neither an ascending nor a descending meso-colon. In twenty- two there was a descending meso-colon, but no trace of a corresponding fold on the other side. In fourteen subjects there was a meso-colon to both the ascending and the descending segments of the bowel; while in the remaining twelve there was an ascending meso-colon, but no corresponding fold on the left side. It follows, therefore, that in performing lumbar colotomy a meso-colon may be expected upon the left side in 36 per cent, of all cases, and on the right 26 per cent.

It curves in the first place inwards, across the Psoas muscle ; it then descends vertically along the left wall of the pelvis, and finally again passes inwards to the left sacro-iliac joint, where it becomes the rectum. It is retained in its place by a loose fold of peritoneum, the sigmoid meso-colon. It is in relation, in front, with the small intestines and abdominal parietes.* The rectum is the terminal part of the large intestine, and extends from the sigmoid flexure to the anus; it varies in length from six to eight inches, and has received its name from being less flexuous than any other part of the intestinal canal. It commences opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis, passes obliquely downwards from left to right to the middle of the sacrum, forming a gentle curve to the right side ; it then descends in front of the lower part of the sacrum and coccyx, presenting a curve with its concavity forwards, and, near the extremity of the latter bone, inclines backwards to terminate at the anus. The rectum is, therefore, not straight, the upper part being directed obliquely from the left side to the median line, the middle portion being curved in the direction of the hollow of the sacrum and coccyx, and the lower portion presenting a short curve in the opposite direction. The rectum is cylindrical, not sacculated like the rest of the large intestine ; it is narrow^er at its upper part than the sigmoid flexure, gradually increases in size as it descends, and immediately above the anus presents a considerable dilatation, capable of acquiring an enormous size. The rectum is divided into three portions—-upper, middle, and lower. The ui)ioer ijortion, which includes about half the length of the tube, extends obliquely from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the middle of the third piece of the sacrum. It is almost completely surrounded by peritoneum, and connected to the sacrum behind by a duplicature of that membrane, the meso-rectum. It is in relation, behind, with the Pyriformis muscle, the sacral plexus of nerves, and the branches of the internal iliac artery of the left side, which separate it from the sacrum and sacro-iliac symphysis ; in front, it is separated, in the male, from the posterior surface of the bladder ; in the female, from the posterior surface of the uterus and its appendages, by some convolutions of the small intestine. The middle portion of tJie rectum is about three inches in length, and extends as far as the tip of the coccyx. It is closely connected to the concavity of the sacrum, and covered by peritoneum only on the upper part of its anterior surface. It is in relation, in front, in the male, with the triangular portion of the base of the bladder, the vesicul^ seminales, and vasa deferentia ; more anteriorly, with the under surface of the prostate. In the female, with the posterior wall of the vagina, to which it is adherent. The loioe7' portion is about an inch or an inch and a half in length ; it curves backwards at the fore part of the prostate gland, and terminates at the anus. This portion of the intestine receives no peritoneal covering. It is invested by the Internal sphincter, supported by the Levatores ani muscles, and surrounded at its termination by the External sphincter. In the male, it is separated from the membranous portion and bulb of the urethra by a triangular space; and in the female, a similar space intervenes between it and the vagina. The base of this space forms the perinasum. The rectum in the female is more capacious and less curved than in the male. Structure.—The large intestine has four coats—serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum, and invests the different portions of the large intestine to a variable extent. The caecum is completely covered by * Treves describes the sigmoid flexure somewhat differently. He includes in his description of this portion of the bowel the upper part of the rectum, and makes it termi- nate opposite the third portion of the sacrum. Instead of forming a sigmoid curve, he describes it as a large loop or bend, more like the Greek letter O (omega).927 STRUCTURE OF LARGE INTESTINE the serous membrane. The ascending and descending colon are usually covered only in front.* The transverse colon is almost completely invested, the parts corresponding to the attachment of the great omentum and transverse meso-colon being alone excepted. The sigmoid flexure is nearly completely surrounded, the point corresponding to the attachment of the sigmoid meso-colon being excepted. The upper part of the rectum is almost completely invested by the peritoneum ; the middle portion is covered only on its anterior surface; and the lower portion is entirely devoid of any serous covering. In the course of the colon and upper part of the rectum, the peritoneal coat is thrown into a number of small pouches filled with fat, called appendices epiploicce. They are chiefly appended to the transverse colon. The muscular coat consists of an external longitudinal and an internal circular layer of muscular fibres. The longitudinal fibres, although found to a certain extent all round the intes- tine, do not form a uniform layer over the whole surface of the large intestine. In the caecum and colon they are especially collected into three flat longitudinal ba,nds, each being about half an inch in width. These bands commence at the attachment of the appendix vermiformis to the caecum : one, the posterior, is placed along the Fig. 545.—Minute structure of large intestine. Solitary gland attached border of the intestine ; the anterior band, the largest, corresponds along the arch of the colon to the attachment of the great omentum, but is in front in the ascending and descending colon and sigmoid flexure ; the third, or lateral band, is found on the inner side of the ascending and descending colon, and on the under border of the transverse colon. These bands are nearly one-half shorter than the other parts of the intestine, and serve to produce the sacculi which are characteristic of the caecum and colon ; accordingly, when they are dissected off, the tube can be lengthened, and its sacculated character becomes lost. In the sigmoid flexure the longitudinal fibres become more scattered; but upon its lower part, and rocind the rectum, they spread out and form a thick uniform layer. The circular fibres form a thin layer over the caecum and colon, being especially accumulated in the intervals between the sacculi; in the rectum they form a thick layer, especially at its lower end, where they become numerous, and form the Internal sphincter. The areolar coat connects the muscular and mucous layers closely together. The mucous membrane, in the ctecum and colon, is pale, and of a greyish or pale yellow colour. It is quite smooth, destitute of villi, and raised into numerous cres- centic folds which correspond to the intervals between the sacculi. In the rectum it is thicker, of a darker colour, more vascular, and connected loosely to the muscular * See foot-note, p. 923.ORGANS OF DIGESTION 928 coat, as in the a^^opha^us. ^^'llen the lower part of the rectum is contracted, its mucous membrane is thrown into a number of folds, some of which, near the anus, are longitudinal in direction, and are effaced by the distension of the gut. Besides these there are certain permanent folds, of a semilunar shape, known as Houston's valves.* They are usually three in number ; sometimes a fourth is found, and occasionally only two are present. One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side ; another extends inwards from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum ; the largest and most constant one projects back- wards from the fore part of the rectum, opposite the base of the bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated about an inch above the anus on the back of the rectum. These folds are about half an inch in width, and contain some of the circular fibres of the gut. In the empty state of the intestine they overlap each other, as Mr. Houston remarks, so effectually as to require considerable manoeuvring to conduct a bougie or the finger along the canal of the intestine. Their use seems to be, ' to support the weight of ffecal matter, and prevent its urging towards the anus, where its presence always excites a sensation demanding its discharge.' As in the small intestine, the mucous membrane consists of a muscular layer, the muscularis mucosa?; of a quantity of retiform tissue in which the vessels ramify ; of a basement membrane and epithelium, which is of the columnar variety, and exactly resembles the epithelium found in the small intestine. The mucous membrane of this portion of the bowel presents for examination simple follicles and solitary glands. The sijujjle foiliclcs 'Are minute tubular prolongations of the mucous membrane, arranged perpendicularly, side by side, over its entire surface ; they are longer, more numerous, and placed in much closer apposition than those of the small intestine ; and they open by minute rounded orifices upon the surface, giving it a cribriform appearance. The solitary glands (fig. 545) in the large intestine are most abundant in the ccecum and appendix vermiformis, but are irregularly scattered also over the rest of the intestine. They are similar to those of the small intestine. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the large intestine give off large branches, which ramify between the muscular coats, supplying them, and, after dividing into small vessels in the submucous tissue, pass to the mucous membrane. In the lower part of the rectum, however, the arrangement is somewhat different. Here the vessels run in a longitudinal direction, parallel with each other, to the external orifice, where they are joined by large transverse branches. In their course they communicate with each other. The veins of the rectum form an intricate interlacement (the Juemorrhoidal plexus), and, ]3ursuing from it a longitu- dinal course, similar to the arteries, empty themselves partly into the internal iliac vein (systemic circulation), and partly into the inferior mesenteric vein (portal circulation). The nerves are derived from the plexuses of the sympathetic nerve around the branches of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries that are distributed to the large intestine. They are distributed in a similar way as those in the small intestine. Su7-facc Form.—The coils of the small intestine occupy the front of the abdomen, below the transverse colon, and are covered more or less completely by the great omentum. For the most part the coils of the jejunum occupy the left side of the abdominal cavity, i.e. the left lumbar and in.o-iiinal regions and the left half of the umbihcal region; whilst the coils of the ileum are situated to the right, in the right lumbar and inguinal regions, in the right half of the umbilical re.iiion, and also the hypogastric. The Ciecum is situated m the right inguinal region. Its position varies slightly, but the mid-point of a line drawn from the anterior superior spint)ns process of the ilium to the symphysis pubis will about mark the middle of its lower border. It is comparatively superficial. From it the ascendins^ colon passes upwards through the right lumbar and hypochondriac regions, and becomes more deeply situated as it ascends to the hepatic tlexure, which is deeply placed, under cover of the \i\ev. The transverse colon crosses the belly transversely on the confines of the umbilical and epigastric regions ; its lower border being on a level slightly above the umbilicus, its upper border just below the greater curvature of the stomach. The splenic * Dublin Hosj). Beports, vol. v. p. 163.929 SUEGICAL ANATOMY flexure of the colon is situated behind the stomach in the left hvpochondrimii, and is on a higher level than the hepatic flexure. The descending colon is deeply seated, passing down through the left hypochondriac and lumbar regions to the sigmoid flexure, which is situated in the left inguinal regions and which can be felt in thin persons, with relaxed abdominal walls, rolling under the fingers when empty, and when distended forming a distinct tumour. Surgical Anatomy.—The small intestines are much exposed to injury, but, in consequence of their elasticity and the ease with which one fold glides over another, they are not so frequently ruptm^ed as would otherwise be the case. Any part of the small intestine may be ruptured, but probably the most common situation is the transverse duodenum, on account of its being more fixed than other portions of the bowel, and because it is situated in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, so that if this portion of the abdomen is struck by a sharp blow, as from the kick of a horse, it is unable to glide out of the way, but is compressed against the bone and so lacerated. Wounds of the intestine sometimes occur. If the wound is a small puncture, under, it is said, three lines in length, no extravasation of the contents of the bowel takes place. The mucous membrane becomes everted and plugs the little opening. The bowels, therefore, may be safely punctm^ed with a fine capillary trocar, in cases of excessive distension of the intestine with gas, without fear of extravasation. A longitudinal wound gapes more than a transverse, owing to the greater amount of circular muscular fibres. The small intestine, and most frequently the ileum, may become strangulated by internal bands, or through apertures, normal or abnormal. The bands may be formed in several different ways : they may be old peritoneal adhesions from previous attacks of peritonitis ; or an adherent omentum from the same cause ; or the band may be formed by Meckel's diverticulum, which has contracted adhesions at its distal extremity; or the band may be the result of the abnormal attachment of some normal structure, as the adhesion of tw'o appendices epiploicae, or an adherent vermiform appendix or Fallopian tube. Intussusception or invagmation of the small intestine may take place in any part of the jejunum and ileum, but the most frequent situation is at the ileo-caecal valve, the valve forming the apex of the entering tube. This form may attain great size, and it is not uncommon in these cases to find the valve projecting from the anus. Stricture, the impaction of foreign bodies, and twisting of the gut {volvulus) may lead to intestinal obstruction. Foreign bodies and small hardened masses of fsecal matter are very liable to become lodged in the vermiform appendix. Here they set up inflammation, often cause perforation of the appendix and formation of abscess in the loose connective tissue around. This may require operative interference, and in some cases of recurrent attacks of appendicitis this little diverticulum of the bowel has been removed. In external hernia the ileum is the portion of bowel most frequently herniated. When a part of the large intestine is involved it is usually the caecum, and this may occm* even on the left side. In some few cases the vermiform appendix has been the part implicated in cases of strangulated hernia, and has given rise to serious symptoms of obstruction. OccasionaUj' ulceration of the duodenal glands may occur in cases of burns, but is not a \e.v\ common complication. The ulcer may perforate one of the large duodenal vessels and may cause death from haemorrhage, or it may perforate the coats of the intestine and produce fatal acute peritonitis. The diameter of the large intestine gradually diminishes from the caecum, which has the greatest diameter of any part of the bowel, to the point of junction of the sigmoid flexure with the rectum, at or a little below which point stricture most commonly occurs and diminishes in frequency as one proceeds upwards to the caecum. When distended by some obstruction low down, the outline of the large intestine can be defined throughout nearly the whole of its course—all, in fact, except the hepatic and splenic flexm^es, which are more deeply placed; the distension is most obvious in the two flanks and on the front of the abdomen just above the mnbilicus. The caecum, however, is that portion of the bowel which is, of all, most distended. It sometimes assumes enormous dimensions, and has been known to be perforated from the pressure, causing fatal peritonitis. The hepatic flexure and the right extremity of the transverse colon is in close relationship with the liver, and abscess of this viscus sometimes bursts into the gut in this situation. The gall bladder may become adherent to the colon, and gall-stones may find their w^aj' through into the gut, where they may become impacted or may be discharged ^ev anum. The mobility of the sigmoid flexure renders it more liable to become the seat of a volvulus or twist than any other part of the intestine. It generally occurs in patients who have been the subjects of habitual constipation, and in whom therefore the meso-sigmoid flexm^e is elongated. The gut at this part being loaded with faeces, from its w^eight falls over the gut below, and so gives rise to the twist. The sm-gical anatomy of the rectum is of considerable importance. There may be congenital malformations due to arrest or imperfect development. Thus, there may be no inflection of the epiblast (see page 103), and consequently a complete absence of the anus ; or the hind-gut may be imperfectly developed, and there may be an absence of the rectum, though the anus is developed ; or the inflection of the epiblast may not communicate with the termination of the hind-gut from want of solution of continuity in the septum which in early foetal life exists between the two. The mucous membrane is thick and but loosely connected to the muscular coat beneath, and thus favours prolapse, especiallv in children. 30ORGANS OF DIGESTION The vessels of the rectum are arranged, as mentioned above, longitudinallj^ and are contamed in the loose cellular tissue between the mucous and muscular coats, and receive no support from surrounding tissues, and this favours varicosity-. Moreover, the blood from these vessels is returned into the general circulation through two distinct channels, part through the systemic system and part through the portal system ; so that they may be said to be placed between the portal and systemic circulations, and thus predisposed to congestion and consequent dilatation. In addition to this there are no valves in the superior hsemor- rhoidal veins, and the vessels of the rectum are placed in a dependent position, and are liable to be pressed upon and obstructed by hardened fseces. The anatomical arrangement, therefore, of the haemorrhoidal vessels explains the great tendency to the occurrence of piles. Again, the presence of the Sphincter ani is of surgical importance, since it is the constant contraction of this muscle which prevents an ischio-rectal abscess from healing, and causes it to become a fistula. Also the reflex contraction of this muscle is the cause of the severe pain complained of in fissure of the anus. The relations of the peritoneum to the rectum are of importance in connection with the operation of removal of the lower end of the rectum for malignant disease. This membrane gradually leaves the rectum as it descends into the pelvis; first leaving its posterior surface, then the sides, and then the anterior surface, to become reflected, in the male on to the posterior wall of the bladder, forming the recto-vesical pouch, and in the female on to the posterior wall of the vagina, forming Douglas's pouch. The recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum extends to within three and a half or four inches from the anus, so that it is not safe to remove more than three inches of the entire circumference of the bowel for fear of the risk of opening the perito- neum. When, however, the disease is confined to the posterior surface of the rectum, or extends farther in this direction, a greater amount of the posterior wall of the gut may be removed, as the peritoneum does not extend on this surface to a lower level than five inches from the margin of the anus. The recto-vaginal or Douglas's pouch in the female extends somewhat lower than the recto-vesical pouch of the male, and therefore it is necessary to remove a less length of the tube in this sex.* Upon introducing the finger into the rectum, the membranous portion of the urethra can be felt, if an instrument has been introduced into the bladder, exactly in the middle line ; behind this the prostate gland can be recognised by its shape and hardness and any enlargement detected ; behind the prostate the fluctuating wall of the bla.dder when full can be felt, and if thought desirable it can be tapped in this situation; on either side and behind the prostate the vesiculae seminales can be readily felt, especially if enlarged by tubercular disease. Behind, the coccyx is to be felt, and on the mucous membrane one or two of Houston's folds. The ischio-rectal fossae can be explored on either side, with a view to ascertaining the presence of deep-seated collections of pus. Finally, it will be noted that the finger is firmly gripped by the sphincter for about an inch up the bowel. By gradual dilatation of the sphmcter, the whole hand can be introduced into the rectum so as to reach the descending colon. This method of exploration is rarely, however, required for diagnostic purposes. The colon frequently requires opening in cases of intestinal obstruction ; the descending colon being usually the portion of bowel selected for this operation. The operation of colotomy may be performed either without opening the peritoneum by an incision in the loin (lumbar colotomy), or by an opening through the peritoneum (inguinal colotomy). Lumbar colotomy is performed by placing the patient on the side opposite to the one to be operated on, with a firm pillow under the loin. A line is then drawn from the anterior superior to the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and the mid-point of this line (Heath) or half an inch behind the mid-point (AUingham) is taken, and a line di-awn vertically upwards from it to the last rib. This line represents, with sufticient correctness, the position of the normal colon. An oblique incision four inches in length is now made midway between the last rib and the crest of the ilium, so that its centre bisects the vertical line, and the following parts successively divided: (i) The skin, superficial fascia, with cutaneous vessels and nerves and deep fascia. (2) The posterior fibres of the External oblique and anterior fibres of the Latissimus dorsi. (3) The Internal oblique. (4) The lumbar fascia and the external border of the Quadratus lumborum. The edges of the wound are now to be held apart with retractors, and the transversalis fascia will be exposed. This is to be opened with care, commencing at the posterior angle of the incision. If the bowel is distended, it will bulge into the wound, and no difficulty will be found in dealing with it. If, however, the gut is empty this bulging will not take place, and the colon will have to be sought for. The guides to it are the lower end of the kidney which will be plainly felt, and the outer edge of the Quadratus lumborum. The bowel having been found, is to be drawn well up into the wound, and it may be opened at once and the margins of tlie opening stitched to the skin at the edge of the wound ; or, if the case is not an urgent one, it may be retained in this position by two harelip pins passed through the muscular coat, the rest of the wound closed, and the bowel opened in three or four days, when adhesion of the bowel to the edges of the wound has taken place. Inguinal colotomy is preferred by many surgeons in those cases where there is no urgent AUingham says one inch less in the female.THE LIVER 931 obstruction, and where, therefore, there is no necessity to open the bowel at once. The main reason for preferring this operation is that a spur-shaped process of the meso-colon can be formed which prevents any fsecal matter finding its way past the artificial anus, and becoming lodged on the diseased structures below. The sigmoid flexure being almost entirely surrounded by peritoneum, a coil can be drawn out of the wound and the greater part of its calibre removed, leaving the remainder attached to the meso-colon, which forms a spiu", much the same as in an artificial anus caused by sloughing of the gut after a strangulated hernia, and this prevents any faecal matter finding its way from the gut above the opening into that below. The operation is performed by making an incision two or three inches in length from a point one inch internal to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, parallel to Poupart's ligament. The various layers of abdominal muscles are cut through, and the peritoneum opened and sewn to the external skin. The sigmoid flexure is now sought for, and pulled out of the wound and fixed by passing a needle threaded with carbolised silk through the meso-colon close to the gut, and then through the abdominal wall. The intestine is now sewn to the skin all round, the sutures passing only through the serous and muscular coats. The wound is dressed, and on the second to the fourth day, according to the requirements of the case, the protruded coil of intestine is opened and removed with scissors. The Liver The Liver is a glandular organ of large size, intended mainly for the secretion of the bile, but effecting also important changes in certain constituents of the blood in their passage through the gland. It is situated in the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions, but in the child extends across the epigastrium into the left hypochondrium. It is the largest gland in the body, weighing from three to four pounds (from fifty to sixty ounces avoirdupois). It measures, in its transverse diameter, from ten to twelve inches; from six to seven in its antero-posterior; and is about three inches thick at the back part of the right lobe, which is the thickest part. Its upper or diaphragmatic surface is convex, directed upwards and forwards, smooth, covered by peritoneum. It is in relation with the under surface of the Diaphragm; and below, to a small extent, with the abdominal parietes. The surface is divided into two unequal lobes, the right and left, by a fold of peritoneum, the suspensory or hroad ligament. It presents on the left lobe a shallow depression, corresponding to the heart. Its under or visceral surface is concave, directed downwards and backwards, and is in relation with the stomach and duodenum, the hepatic flexure of the colon, and the right kidney and suprarenal capsule. The surface is divided by a longitudinal fissure into a right and left lobe. The posterior surface is rounded and broad over the right lobe, but narrow on the left. It is not covered by peritoneum, and is in contact with the Diaphragm and posterior wall of the abdomen, and is marked off from the upper surface by the line of reflection of the peritoneum from the under surface of the Diaphragm to the upper surface of the liver. On the right lobe, this surface, which is here broad, is marked off from the under surface of the liver by the line of reflection of peritoneum from the posterior portion of the Diaphragm on to the liver, which forms the posterior layer of the coronary ligament. In its centre this posterior surface is deeply notched for the vertebral column, and to the right of this it is indented for the inferior vena cava, which is partly embedded in its substance. Close to the right of the vein is a slight depression for the right suprarenal capsule. To the left of the vena cava is the narrow ridge bounding the lobus Spigelii behind, and to the left of this a groove indicating the position of the oesophageal orifice of the stomach. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and marked opposite the attachment of the longitudinal ligament by a deep notch, and opposite the cartilage of the ninth rib by a second notch for the fundus of the gall-bladder. In adult males this border usually corresponds with the margin of the ribs ; but in women and children it usually projects below the ribs. The right extremity of the liver is thick and rounded, whilst the left is thin and flattened. 302932 ORGANS OF DIGESTION Ligaments.—The ligaments of the liver (fig. 546) are five in number, four being formed of folds of peritoneum ; the fifth, the ligamentum teres, is a round fibrous cord, resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. The ligaments are, the longitudinal, two lateral, coronary, and round. The longitudinal ligament (broad, falciform, or suspensory ligament) is a broad Fig. 546.—The liver. Upper surface. and thin antero-posterior peritoneal fold, falciform in shape, its base being directed forwards, its apex backwards. It is attached by one margin to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and the posterior surface of the sheath of the Right rectus muscle as low down as the umbilicus; by its hepatic margin it extends from the notch on Fig. 1547.—The liver. Under surface. the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as its posterior surface. It consists of i two layers of peritoneum closely united together. Its anterior free edge contains! the round ligament between its layers. The lateral ligaments, two in number, right and left, are triangular in shape.: They are formed of two layers of peritoneum united, and extend from the sides ofjTHE LIVER 933 the Diaphragm to the extremities of the posterior surface of the organ. The left is the longer of the two, and lies in front of the oesophageal opening in the Diaphragm. The coronary ligament connects the posterior surface of the liver to the Dia- phragm. It is formed by the reflection of the peritoneum from the Diaphragm on to the upper and lower margins of the posterior surface of the organ. The coronary ligament consists of two layers, which are continuous on each side with the lateral ligaments; and, in front, with the longitudinal ligament. Between the layers, a large oval space is left uncovered by peritoneum, and is connected to the Diaphragm by firm areolar tissue. The round ligament (fig. 546) is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein. It ascends from the umbilicus, in the anterior free margin of the longitudinal ligament, to the notch in the anterior border of the liver, from which it may be traced along the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver, as far back as the inferior vena cava. Fissures (fig. 547).—Five fissures are seen upon the under and posterior surfaces of the liver, which serve to divide it into five lobes. They are, the longitudinal fissure, the fissure of the ductus venosus, the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the inferior vena cava. They are arranged in the form of the letter A ; the apex of the letter corresponding to the posterior surface of the liver, its base to the anterior free border. The connecting bar would represent the transverse fissure; the two converging limbs posterior to this would represent, the left one, the fissure for the ductus venosus ; the right one, the fissure for the inferior vena cava; the two diverging limbs anterior to the cross-bar would represent the umbilical fissure {left), and the fissure for the gall-bladder [right). The longitudinal fi,sstire is a deep groove, which extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver to the posterior surface of the organ. It separates the right and left lobes ; the transverse fissure joins it, at right angles, about one- third from its posterior extremity, and divides it into two parts. The anterior half is called the umbilical fissure ; it is deeper than the posterior part, and lodges the umbilical vein in the foetus, or its remains (the round ligament) in the adult. This fissure is often partiall}- bridged over by a prolongation of the hepatic substance, the 'pons hepatis. The fissure of the ductus venosus is the back part of the longitudinal fissure, and is situated partly on the posterior surface of the liver; it is shorter and shallowei than the anterior portion. It lodges in the foetus the ductus venosus , and in the adult a slender fibrous cord, the obliterated remains of that vessel. The transverse or portal fissure is a short but deep fissure, about two inches in length, extending transversely across the under surface of the right lobe, nearer to its posterior surface than its anterior border. It joins, nearly at right angles, with the longitudinal fissure. By the older anatomists this fissure was considered the gateway (porta) of the liver; hence the large vein which enters at this point was called the portal vein. Besides this vein, the fissure transmits the hepatic artery and nerves, and the hepatic duct and lymphatics. At their entrance into the fissure, the hepatic duct lies in front and to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the portal vein behind and between the duct and artery. The fissure for the gall-bladder { fossa cystis fellece) is a shallow, oblong fossa, placed on the under surface of the right lobe, parallel with the longitudinal fissure. It extends from the anterior free margin of the liver, which is occasionally notched for its reception, to near the right extremity of the transverse fissure. The fissure for the inferior vena cava is a short, deep fissure, occasionally a complete canal, which extends obliquely upwards from a little behind the right extremity of the transverse fissure on to the posterior surface of the liver, where it joins the fissure for the ductus venosus. On slitting open the inferior vena cava which is contained in it, a deep fossa is seen, at the bottom of which the hepatic veins communicate with this vessel. This fissure is separated from theOEGANS OF DIGESTION 934 transverse fissure by the lobns cauclatns, and from the longitudinal fissure by the lobulus Spigelii. Lobes.—The lobes of the liver, like the ligaments and fissures, are five in number—the right lobe, the left lobe, the lobus quadratus, the lobulus Spigelii, and the lobus caudatus. The rigJit lobe is much larger than the left; the proportion between them being as six to one. It occupies the right hypochondrium, and is separated from the left lobe, on its upper surface, by the longitudinal ligament; on its under and posterior surfaces by the longitudinal fissure ; and in front by a deep notch. It is of a quadrilateral form, its under surface being marked by three fissures—the transverse fissure, the fissure for the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the inferior vena cava ; and by three shallow impressions, one in front {ivipressio colica), for the hepatic flexure of the colon; and one behind {impixssio renalis), for the right kidney, and one internal, between the last-named and the gall-bladder {impressio duodenalis), for the second part of the duodenum. The left lobe is smaller and more flattened than the right. It is situated in Fig. 548.—Under surface of the liver. (From Ellis.) LOBUS CAUDATUS SUPRARENAL BILE DUCT the epigastric region. Its upper surface is convex ; its under surface is concave, and presents a shallow depression for the stomach (gastric im^jression). This is situated in front of the groove for the oesophagus, and is separated from the longitudinal fissure by a well-marked prominence, the omental tuberosity, which lies against the small omentum and lesser curvature of the stomach. The lobus quadratus, or square lobe, is situated on the under surface of the right lobe, bounded in front by the free surface of the liver; behind, by the transverse fissure; on the right, by the fissure for the gall-bladder; and, on the left, by the umbilical fissure. The lobulus Spigelii projects from the back part of the under surface of the right lobe. It is bounded, in front, by the transverse fissure ; on the right, by the fissure for the vena cava; and, on the left, by the fissure for the ductus venosus. The lobus caudatiis, or tailed lobe, is a small elevation of the hepatic substance, extending obliquely outwards, from the base of the lobulus Spigelii, to the under surface of the right lobe. It separates the right extremity of the transverse fissure from the commencement of the fissure for the inferior vena cava.935 STRUCTUKE OF THE LIVER Vessels.—The vessels connected with the hver are also five in number: they are, the hepatic artery, the portal vein, the hepatic vein, the hepatic duct, and the lymphatics. The hepatic artery and portal vein, accompanied by numerous lymphatics and nerves, ascend to the transverse fissure, between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. The hepatic duct, lying in company with them, descends from the transverse fissure between the layers of the same omentum. The relative position of the three structures is as follows :—The hepatic duct lies to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the portal vein behind and between the other two. They are enveloped in a loose areolar tissue, the capsule of Glisson, which accompanies the vessels in their course through the portal canals, in the interior of the organ. The hepatic veins convey the blood from the liver. They commence in the substance of the liver, in the capillary terminations of the portal vein and hepatic artery ; these tributaries, gradually uniting, usually form three large veins, which converge towards the posterior surface of the liver and open into the inferior vena cava, whilst that vessel is situated in the groove at the back part of this organ. Of these three veins, one from the right and another from the left lobe open Fig. 549.—Longitudinal section of an Fig. 5 50.—Longitudinal section of a small hepatic vein. (After Kiernan.) portal vein and canal. (After Kiernan.) f)rific.es of mtralobidar veins removed obliquely into the vena cava: that from the middle of the organ and lobulus Spigelii having a straight course. The hepatic veins have no cellular investment, consequently their parietes are adherent to the walls of the canals through which they run ; so that, on a section of the organ, these veins remain widely open and solitary, and may be easily dis- tinguished from the branches of the portal vein, which are more or less collapsed, and always accompanied by an artery and duct. The hepatic veins are destitute of valves. The lymphatics are large and numerous, consisting of a deep and superficial set. They have been already described. Nerves.—The nerves of the liver are derived from the hepatic plexus of the sympathetic, from the pneumogastric nerves, especially the left, and from the right phrenic. Structure.—The substance of the liver is composed of lobules, held together by an extremely fine areolar tissue, and of the ramifications of the portal vein, hepatic duct, hepatic artery, hepatic veins, lymphatics, and nerves ; the whole being invested by a serous and a fibrous coat.936 ORGANS OF DIGESTION The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum, and invests the greater part of the sm-face of the organ. It is intimately adherent to the fibrous coat. The fibrous coat Ues beneath the serous investment, and covers the entire surface of the organ. It is difficult of demonstration, excepting where the serous coat is deficient. At the transverse fissure it is continuous with the capsule of Glisson, and, on the surface of the organ, with the areolar tissue separating the lobules. The lobules form the chief mass of the hepatic substance; they may be seen either on the surface of the organ, or by making a section through the gland. They are small granular bodies, about the size of a millet seed, measuring from one-twentieth to one-tenth of an inch in diameter. In the human subject their outline is very irregular ; but in some of the lower animals (for example, the pig) they are well-defined, and, when divided transversely, have a polygonal outline. If divided longitudinally they are more or less foliated or oblong. The bases of the lobules are clustered round the smallest radicles (sublobular) of the hepatic veins, to which each is connected by means of a small branch which issues from the centre of the lobule {intralobular). The remaining part of the surface of each lobule is imperfectly isolated from the surrounding lobules by a thin stratum of Fig. 551.—Horizontal section of liver (dog). Intralobular vein areolar tissue, in which is contained a plexus of vessels (the interlobular i)lexus) and ducts. In some animals, as the pig, the lobules are completely isolated one from another by this interlobular areolar tissue. If one of the sublobular veins be laid open, the bases of the lobules may be seen through the thin wall of the vein on which they rest, arranged in the form of a tesselated pavement, the centre of each polygonal space presenting a minute aperture, the mouth of an intralobular vein (fig. 549). Microscopic appearance.—Each lobule is composed of a mass of cells {lieimtic cells), surrounded by a dense capillary plexus, composed of vessels which penetrate from the circumference to the centre of the lobule, and terminate in a single straight vein, which runs through its centre, to open at its base into one of the radicles of the hepatic vein. Between the cells are also the minute com- mencements of the bile-ducts. Therefore, in the lobule we have all the essentials of a secreting gland ; that is to say : (i) cells, by which the secretion is formed ; (2) blood-vessels, in close relation with the cells, containing the blood from which the secretion is derived ; and (3) ducts, by which the secretion, when formed, is carried away. Each of these structures will have to be further considered. (i) The hepatic cells are of more or less spheroidal form ; but may be rounded, flattened, or many-sided from mutual compression. They vary in size from theSTRUCTUEE OF THE LIVER 937 to the 2 oVo 0^ i^ch in diameter. They consist of a honeycomb network (Klein) without any cell-wall, and contain one or sometimes two distinct nuclei. In the nucleus is a highly refracting nucleolus with granules. Embedded in the honeycomb network are numerous yellow particles, the colouring matter of the bile, and oil-globules. The cells adhere together by their surfaces so as to form rows, which radiate from the centre to the circumference of the lobules. As stated above, they are the chief agents in the secretion of the bile. (2) The blood-vessels.—The blood in the capillary plexus, around the liver-cells, is brought to the liver principally by the portal vein, but also to a certain extent by the hepatic artery. For the sake of clearness, the distribution of the blood derived from the hepatic artery may be considered first. The ]iej)atic artery, entering the liver at the transverse fissure with the portal vein and hepatic duct, ramifies with these vessels through the portal canals. It gives off vaginal branches, which ramify in the capsule of Glisson, and appear to be destined chiefly for the nutrition of the coats of the large vessels, the ducts, and the investing membranes of the liver. It also gives off capsular branches which reach the surface of the organ, terminating in its fibrous coat, in stellate plexuses. Finally, it gives off interlobular branches which form^a plexus on the outer side of each lobule, to supply its wall and the accompanying bile-ducts. From this, lobular branches enter the lobule and end in the capillary network between the cells. Some anatomists, however, doubt whether it transmits any blood directly to the capillary network. The ported vein (fig. 550) also enters at the transverse fissure and runs through the portal canals, enclosed in Glisson's capsule, dividing into branches in its course, which finally break up into a plexus (the interlobular plexus) in the interlobular spaces between the lobules. In their course these branches receive the vaginal and capsular veins, corresponding to the vaginal and capsular branches of the hepatic artery (fig. 550). Thus it will be seen that all the blood carried to the liver by the portal vein and hepatic artery, except perhaps that derived from the interlobular branches of the hepatic artery, directly or indirectly, finds its way into the inter- lobular plexus. From this plexus the blood is carried into the lobule by fine branches which pierce its wall, and then converge from the circumference to the centre of the lobule, forming a number of longitudinal vessels, which are connected by transverse or horizontal branches (fig. 551). In the interstices of the network of vessels thus formed are situated, as before said, the liver-cells ; and here it is that, the blood being brought into intimate connection with the liver-cells, the bile is938 OEGANS OF DIGESTION secreted. Arrivecl at the centre of the lobule, all these minute vessels empty themselves into one vein, of considerable size, which runs down the centre of the lobules from apex to base, and is called the intralobular vein. At the base of the lobule this vein opens directly into the sublobular vein, with which the lobule is connected, and which, as before mentioned, is a radicle of the hepatic vein. The sublobular veins, uniting into larger and larger trunks, end at last in the hepatic veins, which do not receive any intralobular veins. Finally, the hepatic veins, as mentioned at page 657, converge to form three large trunks which open into the inferior vena cava, while that vessel is situated in the fissure appropriated to it at the back of the liver. (3) The ducts.—Having shown how the blood is brought into intimate relation with the hepatic cells in order that the bile may be secreted, it remains now only to consider the way in which the secretion, having been formed, is carried away. Several views have prevailed as to the mode of origin of the hepatic ducts; it seems, however, to be clear that they commence by little passages which are formed between the cells, and which have been termed intercellular biliary passages, or bile capillaries (fig. 552). These passages are merely little channels or interspaces left between the contiguous surfaces of two cells, or in the angle where three or more liver-cells meet (fig. 552), and it seems doubtful whether there is any delicate membrane forming the wall of the space. The channels thus formed radiate to the circumference of the lobule, and, piercing its wall, form a plexus {interlobular) between the lobules. From this plexus ducts are derived which pass into the portal canals, become enclosed in Glisson's capsule, and, accompanying the portal vein and hepatic artery (fig. 553), join with other ducts to form two main trunks, which leave the liver at the transverse fissure, and by their union form the hepatic duct. The Gall-bladder The Gall-bladder is the reservoir for the bile ; it is a conical or pear-shaped musculo-membranous sac, lodged in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and extending from near the right extremity of the transverse fissure to the anterior border of the organ. It is about four inches in length, one inch in breadth at its widest part, and holds from eight to ten drachms. It is divided into a fundus, body, and neck. The fundus, or broad extremity, is directed downwards, forwards, and to the right, and occasionally projects beyond the anterior border of the liver; the body and neck are directed upwards and backwards to the left. The gall-bladder is held in its position by the peritoneum, which, in the> majority of cases, passes over its under surface, but the serous membrane occasionally invests the gall-bladder, which is then connected to the liver by a kind of mesentery. Relations.—The body of tJie gall-bladder is in relation, by its upper surface, with the liver, to which it is connected by areolar tissue and vessels ; by its under surface, with the first portion of the duodenum, occasionally the pyloric end of the stomach, and the hepatic flexure of the colon. The fundus is completely invested by peritoneum ; it is in relation, in front, Avith the abdominal parietes, immediately below the ninth costal cartilage; behind, with the transverse arch of the colon. The neck is narrow, and curves upon itself like the letter S; at its point of connection with the cystic duct it presents a well-marked constriction. When the gall-bladder is distended with bile or calculi, the fundus maybe felt through the abdominal parietes, especially in an emaciated subject: the relations of this sac will also serve to explain the occasional occurrence of abdominal biliary fistulae, through which biliary calculi may pass out, and of the passage of calculi from the gall-bladder into the stomach, duodenum, or colon, which occasionally happens. Structure.—The gall-bladder consists of three coats—serous, fibrous and muscular, and mucous. The external or serous coat is derived from the peritoneum; it completely invests the fundus, but covers the body and neck only on their under surface. The fibro-7nusctUar coat is a thin but strong layer, which forms, the framework939 STRUCTUEE OF THE BILIARY D.UCTS of the sac, consisting of dense fibrous tissue, which interlaces in all directions, and is mixed with plain muscular fibres, which are disposed chiefly in a longitudinal direction, a few running transversely. The internal or mucous coat is loosely connected with the fibrous layer. It is generally tinged with a yellowish-brown colour, and is everywhere elevated into minute rugae, by the union of which numerous meshes are formed ; the depressed intervening spaces having a polygonal outline. The meshes are smaller at the fundus and neck, being most developed about the centre of the sac. Opposite the neck of the gall-bladder the mucous membrane projects inwards in the form of oblique ridges or folds, forming a sort of screw-like valve. The mucous membrane is covered with columnar epithelium, and secretes an abundance of thick viscid mucus ; it is continuous through the hepatic duct with the mucous membrane lining the ducts of the liver, and through the ductus com- munis choledochus with the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. The Biliary Ducts are, the hepatic, the cystic, and the ductus communis choledochus. The hepatic duct.—Two main trunks of nearly equal size issue from the liver at the transverse fissure, one from the right, the other from the left lobe; • these unite to form the hepatic duct, which then passes downwards and to the right for about an inch and a half, between the layers of the lesser omentum, where it joins at an acute angle with the cystic duct, and so forms the ductus communis choledochus. The hepatic duct, as it descends from the transverse fissure of the liver, between the two layers of the lesser omentum, lies in company with the hepatic artery and portal vein. The cystic duct, the smallest of the three biliary ducts, is about an inch and a half in length. It passes obliquely downwards and to the left from the neck of the gall-bladder, and joins the hepatic duct to form the common duct. It lies in the gastro-hepatic omentum in front of the vena portae, the hepatic artery lying to its left side. The mucous membrane lining its interior is thrown into a series of crescentic folds, from five to twelve in number, similar to those found in the neck of the gall-bladder. They project into the duct in regular succession, and are directed obliquely round the tube, presenting much the appearance of a continuous spiral valve. When the duct has been distended, the spaces between the folds are dilated, so as to give to its exterior a sacculated appearance. The ductus communis choledochus, the largest of the three, is the common excretory duct of the liver and gall-bladder. It is about three inches in length, of the diameter of a goose-quill, and formed by the junction of the cystic and hepatic duct. It descends along the right border of the lesser omentum behind the first portion of the duodenum, in front of the vena porta, and to the right of the hepatic artery; it then passes between the pancreas and descending portion of the duodenum, and, running for a short distance along the right side of the pancreatic duct, near its termination, passes, with it, obliquely between the mucous and muscular coats. The two ducts open by a common orifice upon the summit of a papilla, situated at the inner side of the descending portion of the duodenum, a little below its middle. Structure.—The coats of the biliary ducts are, an external or fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The fibrous coat is composed of strong fibro-areolar tissue, with a certain amount of muscular tissue, arranged, for the most part, in a circular manner around the duct. The mucous coat is continuous with the lining membrane of the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and also with that of the duodenum ; and, like the mucous membrane of these structures, its epithehum is of the columnar variety. It is provided wdth numerous mucous glands, which are lobulated and open by minute orifices, scattered irregularly in the larger ducts. In the smaller ducts, which lie in the portal canals in the substance of the liver, are also a number of orifices, disposed in two longitudinal rows, which were formerly regarded as the openings of mucous glands, but which are merely the940 . ORGANS OF DIGESTION orifices of tubular recesses. They occasionally anastomose, and from the sides of them saccular dilatations are given off. Surface Form.—The liver is situated in the right hypochondriac and the epigastric regions, and is moulded to the arch of the Diaphragm. In the greater part of its extent it lies under cover of the lower ribs and their cartilages, but in the epigastric region it comes in contact with the abdominal wall, in the subcostal angle. The ujpjjer limit of the right lohe of the liver may be defined by a line drawn from the articulation of the fifth right costal cartilage to the sternum horizontally outwards to a little below the nipple, and then inclined downwards to reach the seventh rib at the side of the chest. The up^^^r limit of the left lohe may be defined by continuing this line to the left with an inclination downwards as it crosses the gladiolus, to a point about two inches to the left of the sternum on a level with the sixth left costal cartilage. The loiver limit of the liver ma}* be indicated by a line drawn half an inch below the lower border of the thorax on the right side as far as the ninth right costal cartilage, and thence obliquely upwards across the subcostal angle to the eighth left costal cartilage. A slight curved line with its convexity to the left from this point, i.e. the eighth left costal cartilage, to the termination of the line indicating the upper limit, will denote the left margin of the liver. The fmidus of the gall-bladder approaches the surface behind the anterior extremity of the ninth costal cartilage, close to the outer margin of the Right rectus muscle. It must be remembered that the liver is subject to considerable alterations in position, and the student should make himself acquainted with the different circumstances under which this occurs, as they are of importance in determining the existence of enlargement or other diseases of the organ. Its position varies according to the posture of the body. In the erect position in the adult male, the edge of the liver projects about half an inch below the lower edge of the right costal cartilages, and its anterior border can be often felt in this situation if the abdominal wall is thin. In the supine position the liver gravitates backwards, and recedes above the lower margin of the ribs and cannot then be detected b^^ the finger. In the prone position it falls forward, and can then generally be felt in a patient with loose and lax abdominal walls. Its position varies also with the ascent or descent of the Diaphragm. In a deep inspiration the liver descends below the ribs; in expiration it is raised behind them. Again, in emphysema, where the lungs are distended, and the Diaphragm descends very low, the liver is pushed down ; in some other diseases, as phthisis, where the Dia- phragm is much arched, the liver rises very high up. Pressure from without, as in tight- lacing, by compressing the lower part of the chest, displaces the liver considerably: its anterior edge often extending as low as the crest of the ileum; and its convex surface is often at the same thne deeply indented from the pressure of the ribs. Again, its position varies greatly according to the greater or less distension of the stomach and intestines. When the intestines are empty, the liver descends in the abdomen; but when they are distended, it is pushed upwards. Its relations to surrounding organs may also be changed by the growth of tumours, or by collections of fluid in the thoracic or'abdominal cavities. Surgical Anatomy.—On account of its large size, its fixed position, and its friability, the liver is more frequently ruptured than any of the abdominal viscera. The rupture may vary considerably in extent, from a slight scratch to an extensive laceration completely through its substance, dividing it into two parts. Sometimes an internal rupture, without laceration of the peritoneal covering, takes place, and such injuries are most susceptible of repair ; but small tears of the surface may also heal; when, however, the laceration is extensive, death usually takes place from haemorrhage, on account of the fact that the hepatic veins are contained in rigid canals in the liver-substance and are unable to contract, and are moreover unprovided with valves. The liver may also be torn by the end of a broken rib perforating the Diaphragm. The liver may be injured by stabs or other punctured wounds, and when these are inflicted through the chest wall, both pleural and peritoneal cavities may be opened up, and both lung and liver be wounded. In cases of wound of the liver from the front, hernia of a part of this viscus may take place, but can generally easily be replaced. Abscess of the liver is of not unfrequent occurrence, and may open in many different ways on account of the relations of this viscus to other organs. Thus it has been known to burst into the lungs, and the pus been coughed up or into the stomach and the pus vomited; it may burst into the colon, or into the duodenum; or, by perforating the Diaphragm, it may empty itself into the pleural cavity. Frequently it makes its way forwards, and points on the anterior abdominal wall, and finallj^ it may burst into the peritoneal or pericardiac cavities. Abscesses of the liver frequently require opening, and this should be done preferably by an incision in the right semilunar line, in two stages : the peritoneal cavity being opened and the liver over the summit of the abscess being stitched to the parietal peritoneum on the first occasion, and three or four days subsequently the abscess being evacuated. Hydatid cysts are more often found in the liver than in any other of the viscera. The reason of this is not far to seek. The embryo of the egg of the taenia echinococcus, being liberated in the stomach by the disintegration of its shell, bores its way through the gastric walls and usually enters a blood-vessel, and is carried by the blood-stream to the941 THE PANCREAS hepatic capillaries, where its onward course is arrested, and where it undergoes develop- ment into the fully formed hydatid. When the gall-hladder is ruptured, or one of its main ducts, which may occur independently of laceration of the liver, the injury is necessarily fatal, from peritonitis caused by the extravasation of bile into the peritoneal cavity. The gall-bladder may become distended with bile in cases of obstruction of its duct or the common bile duct, or from a collection of gall-stones within its interior, thus forming a large tumour. The swelling is pear-shaped, and projects downwards arid forwards to the umbilicus. It moves with respiration, since it is attached to the liver. To relieve this condition, the gall-bladder must be opened and the gall-stones removed. The opera- tion is performed by an incision, two to three inches long in the right semilunar line, commencing an inch below the costal margin. The peritoneal cavity is opened, and the tumour having been found, sponges are packed round it to protect the peritoneal cavity, and it is aspirated. When the contained fluid has been evacuated the flaccid bladder is drawn out of the abdominal woimd and its wall incised to the extent of an inch, any gall-stones in the bladder are now removed and the interior of the sac sponged dry. If the case is one of obstruction of the duct, an attempt must be made to dislodge the'stone by manipulation through the wall of the duct; or it must be crushed from without by carefully padded forceps. After all obstruction has been removed, a drainage tube is to be inserted and the external wound closed around it; the stitches being passed through the parietal peritoneum and also through the peritoneum covering the gall-bladder around the incision, so as to bring these two surfaces into apposition. The fistulous opening generally closes in the course of a few weeks. The Pancreas Dissection.—The pancreas maybe exposed for dissection in three different ways: i. By raising the liver, drawing down the stomach, and tearing through the gastro-hepatic omentum and the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. 2. By raising the stomach, the arch of the colon, and great omentum, and then dividing the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon and raising the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon. 3. By dividing the two layers of peritoneum, which descend from the great curvature of the stomach to form the great omentum; turning the stomach upwards, and then cutting through the ascending layer of the transverse meso-colon (see fig. 523, page 899). The Pancreas (Trav-Kpea?, all flesh) is a compound racemose gland, analogous in its structure to the salivary glands, though softer and less compactly arranged than those organs. In shape it is transversely oblong, flattened from before back- wards, and bears some resemblance to a dog's tongue, its right extremity being broad, and presenting a sort of angular bend from above downwards, called the head ; whilst its left extremity gradually tapers to form the tail; the intermediate portion being called the body. It is situated transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen, at the back of the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Its length varies from six to eight inches, its breadth is an inch and a half, and its thickness from half an inch to an inch, being greater at its right extremity and along its upper border. Its weight varies from two to three and a half ounces, but it may reach six ounces. The right extremity or head of the pa7icreas (fig. 554) is curved upon itself from above downwards, and is embraced by the concavity of the duodenum. The common bile-duct descends behind, between the duodenum and pancreas ; and the pancreatico-duodenal artery descends in front between the same parts. The lesser end or tail of the pancreas is narrow ; it extends to the left as far as the spleen, and is placed over the left kidney and suprarenal capsule. The body of the pancreas is somewhat prismatic in shape and has three surfaces : anterior, posterior, and inferior. The anterior surface is somewhat concave, and is covered by the posterior surface of the stomach, which rests upon it. T\iQ posterioi surface is separated from the vertebral column by the aorta vena cava, the commencement of the vena porta, the pillars of the Diaphragm, and the superior mesenteric artery and vein. These latter vessels are surrounded by a lobular fold of the gland, which passes transversely to the left behind them, and thus these vessels are embraced by the substance of the gland. This portion is sometimes detached from the rest of the organ, and is called the lesser pancreas. To the left of the vertebral column the posterior surface of the pancreas is inORGANS OF DIGESTION 942 contact with the left renal vessels, the left suprarenal capsule, and the left kidney. Near the upper border of this surface is a groove, running from the centre of the gland to the left, in which is lodged the splenic artery and vein. The inferior surface is narrow, and lies above the third portion of the duodenum, from which it is separated in the middle line by the superior mesenteric vessels, which tilt it somewhat forwards. The left extremity of this surface rests on the splenic flexure of the colon. Projecting above the pancreas, where it crosses the aorta, is the coeliac axis. The pancreatic duct, called the canal of Wirsung, from its discoverer, extends transversely from left to right through the substance of the pancreas, nearer to its lower than its upper border, and lying nearer its anterior than its posterior surface. In order to expose it, the superficial portion of the gland must be removed. It commences by the junction of the small ducts of the lobules situated in the tail of the pancreas, and, running from right to left, it constantly receives the ducts of the various lobules composing the gland, and, considerably augmented in size, it leaves Fig. 554.—The pancreas and its relations. the head of the pancreas, and, descending slightly, it gets into relation with the common bile-duct, lying to its left side, and, passing very obliquely through the mucous and muscular coats of the duodenum, it terminates by an orifice common to it and the ductus communis choledochus upon the summit of an elevated papilla, situated at the inner side of the descending portion of the duodenum, a little below its middle. Sometimes the pancreatic duct and ductus communis choledochus open sepa- rately into the duodenum. The excretory duct of the lesser pancreas is called the ductus iiancreaticus minor ; it opens into the main duct near the duodenum, and sometimes separately into that intestine, at a distance of an inch or more from the termination of the principal duct. The pancreatic duct, near the duodenum, is about the size of an ordinary quill: its walls are thin, consisting of two coats, an external fibrous and an internal mucous ; the latter is thin, smooth, and furnished, near its termination, with a few scattered follicles. Sometimes the pancreatic duct is double up to its point of entrance into the duodenum. In structure, the pancreas resembles the salivary glands. It differs from them.SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PANCREAS 943 however, in certain particulars, and is looser and softer in its texture. It is not enclosed in a distinct capsule, but is surrounded by areolar tissue, which dips down into its interior, and connects together the various lobules of which it is composed. Each lobule, like the lobules of the salivary glands, consists of one of the ultimate ramifications of the main duct, terminating in a number of cascal pouches or acini. The minute ducts are lined by short columnar epithelium, shorter than that found in the salivary ducts. The acini are wavy and convoluted, and are also lined by columnar cells, which present certain characteristics; each cell shows an outer homogeneous, or faintly striated, portion, which becomes deeply stained with dyes, and contains the nucleus, and an inner granular portion which does not easily stain. The lumen of the alveolus is hardly visible, being filled with an interstitial substance containing spindle-shaped cells, the ceiitro-acinarlcells of Langerhans. Fig. 555.—Transverse section through the middle of the first lumbar vertebra, showing the relations of the pancreas. (Branne.) Vessels and Nerves.— The arteries 0/ the imncreas are derived from the splenic and the pancreatico-duodenal branches of the hepatic and the superior mesenteric. Its veins open into the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Its lymj^hatics terminate in the lumbar glands. Its nerves are filaments from the splenic plexus. Surface Form.—The pancreas lies in front of the first lumbar vertebra, and can some- times be felt, in emaciated subjects, when the stomach and colon are empty, by making deep pressure in the middle line about three inches above the umbilicus. Surgical Anatomy.—The pancreas presents but little of surgical importance. It is occasionally the seat of cancer, which usually affects the head or duodenal end, and therefore often speedily involves the common bile duct, leading to persistent jaundice. 03-sts are also occasionally found in it, which may present in the epigastric region, above and to the right of the umbilicus, and may require opening and draining. The fluid in them contains some of the elements of the pancreatic secretion and is very irritating, so that, if allowed to come in contact with the skin of the abdominal wall, it is likely to produce intractable eczema. It has been said that the pancreas is the only abdominal viscus which has never been found in a hernial protrusion; but even this organ has been found, in company with other viscera, in rare cases of diaphragmatic hernia. The pancreas has been known to become invaginated into the intestine, and portions of the organ have sloughed off. In cases of excision of the pylorus great care must be exercisedOEGANS OF DIGESTION 944 to avoid wounding the pancreas, as the escape of the pancreatic fluid may be attended with serious resuhs. According to Billroth, it is likely, in consequence of its peptonising qualities, to dissolve the cicatrix of the stomach. The Spleen The Spleen was formerly classified, together with the thyroid, thymus, and suprarenal capsules, as one of the ductless, or blood glands. It possesses no excretory duct. It is of an oblong, flattened form, soft, of very brittle consistence, highly vascular, of a dark bluish-red colour, and situated in the left hypochondriac region, embracing the cardiac end of the stomach. It is invested by peritoneum, and connected with the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum. Relations.—The external and posterior surface is convex, smooth, and in relation wdth the under surface of the Diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs of the left side. The internal surface is concave, and divided by a vertical fissure, the hilum, into an anterior or larger, and a posterior or smaller portion. The hilum is pierced by several irregular apertures, for the entrance and exit of vessels and nerves. At the margins of the hilum, the two layers of peritoneum are reflected from the surface of the spleen on to the cardiac end of the stomach, forming the gastro-splenic omentum, which contains between its layers the splenic vessels and nerves, and the vasa brevia. In front of the hilum the internal surface, which is directed somewhat forwards, is broad and concave and in contact with the great end of the stomach ; and, below this, with the tail of the pancreas and splenic flexure of the colon. Behind the hilum the internal surface, which is here directed inwards, presents a smooth concave fossa, which rests on the upper and outer border of the left kidney. The upper end, thick and rounded, is in relation with the Diaphragm, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum, the suspensory ligament. The loiver end is pointed, and rests on the costo-colic ligament. The anterior margin is free, rounded, and often notched, especially below. The spleen is held in its position by two folds of peritoneum : one, the gastro- splenic omentum, connects it with the stomach ; and the other, the suspensory ligament, with the under surface of the Diaphragm. It is also supported by the costo-colic ligament, upon which its lower end rests (see page 907). The size and weight of the spleen are liable to very extreme variations at different periods of life, in different individuals, and in the same individual under different conditions. In the adult, in whom it attains its greatest size, it is usually about five inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and an inch or an inch and a half in thickness, and weighs about seven ounces. At birth, its weight, in proportion to the entire body, is almost equal to what is observed in the adult, being as i to 350 : whilst in the adult it varies from i to 320 and 400. In old age the organ not only decreases in weight, but decreases considerably in proportion to the entire body, being as i to 700. The size of the spleen is increased during and after digestion, and varies considerably according to the state of nutrition of the body, being large in highly-fed, and small in starved animals. In intermittent and other fevers it becomes much enlarged, weighing occasionally from 18 to 20 pounds. Structure.—The spleen is invested by two coats—an external serous, and an internal fibro-elastic coat. The external or serous coat is derived from the peritoneum ; it is thin, smooth, and in the human subject intimately adherent to the fibro-elastic coat. It invests almost the entire organ ; being reflected from it, at the hilum, on to the great end of the stomach, and at the upper end of the organ on to the Diaphragm. The fibro-elastic coat forms the framework of the spleen. It invests the exterior of the organ,- and at the hilum is reflected inwards upon the vessels in the form of vaginae or sheaths. From these sheaths, as well as from the inner surface of the fibro-elastic coat, numerous small fibrous bands, trabeculce (fig. 556), are given off in all directions ; these uniting, constitute the areolar framework of the spleen. The framework of the spleen resembles, therefore, a sponge-like material, consisting of a number of small spaces or areolce, formed by the trabeculae, which945 THE SPLEEN are given off from the inner surface of the capsule, or from the sheaths prolonged inwards on the blood-vessels. And in these spaces or areolje is contained the splenic pulp. The proper coat, the sheaths of the vessels and the trabeculae, consist of a dense mesh of white and yellow elastic fibrous tissues, the latter considerably predominating. It is owing to the presence of this tissue that the spleen possesses a considerable amount of elasticity, which allows of the very great variations in size that it presents under certain circumstances. In addition to these constituents of this tunic, there is found in man a small amount of non-striped muscular fibre ; and in some mammalia (e.g. dog, pig, and cat) a very considerable amount, so that the trabecul^e appear to consist chiefly of muscular tissue. It is probably owing to this structure that the spleen exhibits, when acted upon by the galvanic current, faint traces of contractility. The proper substance of the sjoleen or spleen pulp is a soft mass of a dark reddish-brown colour, resembling grumous blood. When examined, by means of a thin section, under the microscope, it is found to consist of a number of branching cells, and of an intercellular substance. The cells are connective-tissue corpuscles, Fig. 5 56.—Transverse section of the spleen, showing the trabecular tissue and the splenic vein and its branches. and have been named the sustentacular or supporting cells of the pulp. The processes of these branching cells communicate with each other, thus forming a delicate reticulated tissue in the interior of the areolae formed by the trabecul^e of the capsule. So that each primary space may be considered to be divided into a number of smaller spaces by the junction of these processes of the branchmg corpuscles. These secondary spaces contain blood, in which, however, the white corpuscles are found to be in larger proportions than they are in ordinary blood. The sustentacular cells are either small, uni-nucleated, or larger, multi-nucleated cells ; they do not become deeply stained with carmine, like the cells of the Malpighian bodies, presently to he described (W. Miiller), but like them they possess amoeboid movements (Cohnheim). In many of them may be seen deep red or reddish-yellow granules of various sizes, which present the characters of the haematin of the blood. Sometimes, also, unchanged blood-discs are seen included in these cells, but more frequently blood-discs are found which are altered both in form and colour. In fact, blood-corpuscles in all stages of disintegration may be noticed to occur within them. Klein has recently pointed out that sometimes these cells, in the young spleen, contain a proliferating nucleus ; that is to say, the 3PORGANS OF DIGESTION 946 nucleus is of large size, and presents a number of knob-like projections, as if small nuclei were budding from it by a process of gemmation. This observation is of importance, as it may explain one possible source of the colourless blood- corpuscles. The interspaces or areola formed by the frameAvork of the spleen are thus filled by a delicate reticulum of branched connective-tissue corpuscles, the interstices of which are occupied by blood, and in which the blood-vessels terminate in the manner now to be described. Blood-vessels of the Spleen.—The splenic artery is remarkable for its large size in proportion to the size of the organ, and also for its tortuous course. It divides into from four to six branches, which enter the hilum of the spleen and ramify throughout its substance (fig. 557), receiving sheaths from an involution of the external fibrous tissue. Similar sheaths also invest the nerves and veins. Each branch runs in the transverse axis of the organ, from within outwards, diminishing in size during its transit, and giving off in its passage smaller branches, some of which i3ass to the anterior, others to the posterior part. These ultimately leave the trabecular sheaths, and terminate in the proper substance of the spleen in small tufts or pencils of minute arterioles, which open into the interstices of the reticulum formed by the branched sustentacular cells. Each of Fig. 557.—Transverse section of the human spleen, showing the distribution of the splenic artery and its branches. the larger branches of the artery supplies chiefly that region of the organ in which the branch ramifies, having no anastomosis with the majority of the other branches. The arterioles, supported by the minute trabeculag, traverse the pulp in all directions in bundles or penicilli of straight vessels. Their external coat, on leaving the trabecular sheaths, consists of ordinary connective tissue, but it gradu- ally undergoes a transformation, becomes much thickened, and converted into a lymphoid material.* This change is effected by the conversion of the connective tissue into a cytogenous tissue ; the bundles of connective tissue becoming looser and laxer, their fibrils more delicate, and containing in their interstices an abundance of lymph-corpuscles (W. Miiller). This lymphoid material is supplied with blood by minute vessels derived from the artery with which they are in contact, and which terminates by breaking up into a network of capillary vessels. The altered coat of the arterioles, consisting of lymphoid tissue, presents here and there thickenings of a spheroidal shape, the Malpighian bodies of the spleen. These bodies vary in size from about the of an inch to the of an inch in * According to Klein, it is the sheath of the small vessel which undergoes this trans- formation, and forms a ' solid mass of adenoid tissue which surrounds the vessel like a cylindrical sheath.'—Atlas of Histology, p. 424.THE SPLEEN 947 diameter. They are merely local expansions or hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue, of which the external coat of the smaller arteries of the spleen is formed. They are most frequently found surrounding the arteriole, which thus seems to tunnel them, but occasionally they grow from one side of the vessel only, and present the appearance of a sessile bud growing from the arterial wall. Klein, however, denies this, and says it is incorrect to describe the Malpighian bodies as isolated masses of adenoid tissue, but that they are always Fig. 558.—Part of a Malpighian cap- sule of the spleen of man. (Klein and Xoble Smith.) formed around an artery, though there is b Ade- generally a greater amount on one side than the other, and that, therefore, in transverse sections, the artery, in the majority of cases, is .found in an eccentric position. These bodies are visible to the naked eye on the surface of a fresh section of the organ, ap- pearing as minute dots of a semi-opaque whitish colour in the dark substance of the pulp. In minute structure they resemble the adenoid tissue of lymphatic glands, con- sisting of a delicate reticulum, in the meshes of which lie ordinary lymphoid cells. The reticulum of the tissue is made up of extremely delicate fibrils, and is comparatively open in the centre of the corpuscle, becoming closer at the peri^Dhery of the body. The cells which it encloses, like the supporting cells of the pulp, are possessed of amoeboid movements, but when treated mth carmine become deeply stained, and can thus easily be recognised from those of the pulp. The arterioles terminate in capillaries, which traverse the pulp in all directions ; their walls become much attenuated, lose their tubular character, and the cells of the lymphoid tissue of which they are composed become altered, presenting a a.

In this manner the capillary vessels terminate, and the blood flowing through them finds its way into the interstices of the reticulated tissue formed by the branched connective-tissue corpuscles of the splenic pulp. Thus the blood passing through the spleen is brought into intimate relation with the elements of the pulp, and no doubt under- goes important changes. After these changes have taken place the blood is collected from the interstices 3 P 2948 OEGANS OF DIGESTION of the tissue by the rootlets of the veins, which commence much in the same way as the arteries terminate. Where a vein is about to commence the connective- tissue corpuscles of the pulp arrange themselves in rows, in such a way as to form an elongated space or sinus. They become changed in shape, being elongated and spindle-shaped, and overlap each other at their extremities. They thus form a sort of endothelial lining of the path or sinus, which is the radicle of a vein. On the outer surface of these cells are seen delicate transverse lines or markings, which are due to minute elastic fibrillse arranged in a circular manner around the sinus. Thus the channel obtains a continuous external investment, and gradually becomes converted into a small vein, which after a time presents a coat of ordinary connective tissue, lined by a layer of fusiform epithelial cells, which are continuous with the supporting cells of the pulp. The smaller veins unite to form larger ones, which do not accompany the arteries, but soon enter the trabecular sheaths of the capsule, and by their junction form from four to six branches, which emerge from the hilum, and, uniting, form the splenic vein, the largest radicle of the vena porta. The veins are remarkable for their numerous anastomoses, while the arteries hardly anastomose at all. The lymphatics originate in two ways, i.e. from the sheaths of the arteries and in the trabeculse. The former accompany the blood-vessels, the latter pass to the superficial lymphatic plexus which may be seen on the surface of the organ. The two sets communicate in the interior of the organ. They pass through the lymphatic glands at the hilum, and terminate in the thoracic duct. The nerves are derived from branches of the right and left semilunar ganglia, and from the right pneumogastric nerve. Surface Form.—The spleen is situated under cover ot the ribs of the left side, being separated from them by the Diaphragm, and above by a small portion of the lower margin of the left lung. Its position corresponds to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. It is placed very obliquely. ' It is oblique in two directions, viz. from above downwards and outwards, and also from above downwards and forwards' (Cunningham). 'Its highest and lowest points are on a level respectively with the ninth dorsal and first lumbar spines ; its inner end is distant about an inch and a half from the median plane of the body, and its outer end about reaches the mid-axillary line' (Quain). Surgical Anatomy.—Injury of the spleen is less common than that of the liver, on account of its protected situation and connections. It may be ruptmed by direct or indirect violence; torn by a broken rib ; or injured by a punctured or gunshot wound. When the organ is enlarged, the chance of rupture is increased. The great risk is hiemorrhage, owinf? to the great vascularity of the organ, and the absence of a proper system of capillaries. The injury is not, however, necessarily fatal, and this would appear to be due, in a great measure, to the contractile power of its capsule, which narrows the wound and prevents the escape of blood. In cases where the diagnosis is clear and the symptoms indicate danger to life, laparotomy must be performed, and if the haemorrhage cannot be stayed by ordinary surgical methods the spleen must be removed. The spleen may become displaced, producing great pain from stretching of the vessels and nerves, and this may require removal of the organ. The spleen may become enormously enlarged in certain diseased conditions, such as ague, syphilis, valvular disease of the heart, or without any obtainable history of previous disease. It may also become enlarged in lymphadenoma, as a part of a general blood-disease. In these cases the tumour may sometimes fill the abdomen and extend into the pelvis, and may be mistaken for ovarian or uterine disease. The spleen is sometimes the seat of cystic tumours, especially hydatids, and of abscess. These cases require treatment by incision and drainage ; and in abscess great care must be taken, if there are no adhesions between the spleen and abdominal cavity, to prevent the escape of any of the pus into the peritoneal cavity. If possible the operation should be performed in two stages, as in abscess of the liver. Sarcoma and carcinoma are occasionally found in the spleen, but very rarely as a primary disease. Extirpation of the spleen has been performed for wounds or injuries, in floating spleen, in simple hypertrophy, and in leukaemic enlargement; but in these latter cases the operation is now regarded as unjustifiable, as every case in which it has been performed has terminated fatally. The incision is best made in the left semilunar line ; the spleen is isolated from its surroundings, and the pedicle transfixed and ligatured in two portions, before the tumour is turned out of the abdominal cavity, if this is possible, so as to avoid any traction on the pedicle, which may cause tearing of the splenic vein. In applying the ligature care must be taken not to include the tail of the pancreas, and in lifting out the organ to avoid rupturing the capsule.THE THOBAX THE Thorax is a conical-shaped cavity, containing and protecting the heart, enclosed in its membranous bag, the pericardium ; and the lungs, invested by the pleura. Its shape and boundaries have already been described (see page 199). The cavity of the thorax.—The size of the cavity of the thorax does not correspond with its apparent size externally, because (i) the space enclosed by the lower ribs is occupied by some of the abdominal viscera ; and (^2) the cavity extends above the first rib into the neck. The size of the cavity of the thorax is constantly varying during life with the movements of the ribs and Diaphragm, and with the degree of distension of the abdominal viscera. From the collapsed state of the lungs in the dead body, it would appear as if the viscera only partly filled the cavity of the thorax, but during life there is no vacant space, that which is seen after death being filled up by the expanded lungs. The upper openings of the thorax.—The parts which pass through the upper opening of the thorax are, from before backwards in the middle line, the Sterno- hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the remains of the thymus gland, the trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, and the Longus colli muscle of each side ; at the sides, the innominate artery, the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, the internal mammary and superior intercostal arteries, the right and left inno- minate veins, and the inferior thyroid veins, the pneumogastric, cardiac, phrenic, and sympathetic nerves, the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the left side. The apex of each lung, covered by the pleura, also projects through this aperture, a little above the margin of the first rib. The lower opening of the thorax is wider transversely than from before back- wards. It slopes obliquely downwards and backwards, so that the cavity of the thorax is much deeper behind than in front. The Diaphragm (see page 421) closes in the opening, forming the floor of the thorax. The floor is flatter at the centre than at the sides, and is higher on the right side than on the left, corresponding in the dead body to the upper border of the fifth costal cartilage on the former, and to the corresponding part of the sixth costal cartilage on the latter. From the highest point on each side the floor slopes suddenly downwards to the attachment of the Diaphragm to the ribs ; this is more marked behind than in front, so that only a narrow space is left between it and the wall of the thorax. The Pericabdium The Pericardium (figs. 560, 561) is a conical membranous sac, in which the heart and the commencement of the great vessels are contained. It is placed behind the sternum, and the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs of the left side, in the interval between the pleurae. Its apex is directed upwards, and surrounds the great vessels about two inches above their origin from the base of the heart. Its base is attached to the central tendon and part of the adjoining muscular structure of the Diaphragm, extending a little farther to the left than to the right side. In front it is separated from theTHE THOEAX sternum by the remains of the thymus gland above, and a little loose areolar tissue below ; and is covered by the margins of the lungs, especially the left. Behind, it rests upon the bronchi, the oesophagus, and the descending aorta. Laterally, it is covered by the pleurae ; the phrenic nerve, with its accompanying vessels, descending between the two membranes on either side. Structure of the Pericardium.—The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane, and consists, therefore, of two layers, an external fibrous and an internal serous. Fig. 560.—Pericardium, from in front. The sac has been distended with plaster. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Eoyal College of Surgeons.) The fibrous layer is a strong, dense membrane. Above, it surrounds the great vessels arising from the base of the heart, on which it is continued in the form of tubular prolongations, which are gradually lost upon their external coat; the strongest being that which encloses the aorta. The pericardium may be traced, over these vessels, to become continuous with the deep layer of the cervical fascia. On each side of the ascending aorta it sends upwards a diverticulum ; the one on the left side, somewhat conical in shape, passes upwards and outwards, between the arch of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, as far as the ductus arteriosus, where it terminates in a caecal extremity which is attached by loose connective tissue to the obhterated duct (fig. 560). The one on the right side passes upwards and to the right, between the ascending aorta and vena cava superior, and also terminates951 THE PERICARDIUM in a cPBcal extremity. Below, the fibrous layer is attached to the central tendon of the Diaphragm ; and, on the left side, to its muscular fibres. The vessels receiving fibrous prolongations from this membrane are, the aorta, the superior vena cava, the right and left pulmonary arteries, and the four pulmonary veins. As the inferior vena cava enters the pericardium through the central tendon of the Diaphragm, it receives no covering from the fibrous layer. The seroiis layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium. It consists, therefore, of a visceral and parietal portion. The Fig. 561.—Pericardium, from behind. (From the same preparation as the preceding figure.) Soch cCou/. A, A. -Z.^ tnn<?m.. I/. ^'^''''inom. I/. former invests the surface of the heart, and the commencement of the great vessels, to the extent of two inches from their origin; from these it is reflected upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer, lining, below, the upper surface of the central tendon of the Diaphragm. The serous membrane encloses the aorta and pulmonary artery in a single tube ; but it only partially covers the superior and inferior vena cava and the four pulmonary veins. Its inner surface is smooth and glistening, and secretes a thin fluid, which serves to facilitate the movements of the heart. Arteries of the pericardium.—These are derived from the internal mammary, and its musculo-phrenic branch, and from the descending thoracic aorta. 'Nerves of the pericardium.—These are branches from the vagus, the phrenic and the sympathetic.952 THE THOEAX The vestigial fold of the pericardium.—In front of the root of the left lung- there is a vertical fibrous band, the vestigial fold of Marshall. It is formed by the remnant of the lower part of the trunk of the left innominate vein which, after birth, became obhterated, between the branch communicating with the right innominate vein and the back of the heart. Surgical ylnafom^.—Paracentesis of the pericardium is sometimes required in cases of effusion into its cavity. The operation is best performed in the fifth intercostal space, one Fig. 562.—Front view of the thorax. The ribs and sternum are represented in relation to the lungs, heart, and other internal organs. Pulmonary orifice. 2. Aortic orifice. 3. Left auriculo-ventricular orifice. 4. Right auriculo-veutricular orifice. inch to the If^ft of the sternum. The operation has been performed, however, in the fourth, sixth, and seventh spaces, and also on the right side of the sternum. The Heart The Heart is a hollow muscular organ of a conical form, placed between the lungs, and enclosed in the cavity of the pericardium. Position.—The heart is placed obliquely in the chest: the broad attached end, or base, is directed upwards, backwards, and to the right, and corresponds to the interval between the fifth and eighth dorsal vertebrae ; the apex is directed downwards, forwards, and to the left, and corresponds to the space between the cartilage of the fifth and sixth ribs, three-quarters of an inch to the inner side, and an inch and a half below the left nipple. The heart is placed behind the lower two-thirds of the sternum, and projects further into the left than into the rightHEART—RIGHT AURICLE 953 cavity of the chest, extending from the median line about three inches in the former direction, and only one and a half in the latter. The anterior surface of the heart is round and convex, directed upwards and forwards, and formed chiefly by the right ventricle and part of the left. Its posterior surface is flat- tened, and rests upon the Diaphragm, and is formed chiefly by the left ventricle. The right border is long, thin, and sharp ; the left border short, but thick and round. Size.— The heart, in the adult, measures five inches in length, three inches and a half in breadth in the broadest part, and two inches and a half in thickness. The prevalent weight, in the male, varies from ten to twelve ounces ; in the female, from eight to ten : its proportions to the body being as i to 169 in males ; i to 149 in females. The heart continues increasing in weight, and also in length, breadth, and thickness, up to an advanced period of life : this increase is more marked in men than in women. Component Parts.—The heart is subdivided by a longitudinal muscular septum into two lateral halves, which are named respectively, from their position, right and left; and a transverse constriction subdivides each half of the organ into two cavities, the upper cavity on each side being called the auricle, the lower the ventricle. The right is the venous side of the heart, receiving into its auricle the dark venous blood from the entire body, by the superior and inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus. From the right auricle the blood passes into the right ventricle, and from the right ventricle, through the pulmonary artery, into the lungs. The blood, arterialised by its passage through the lungs, is returned to the left side of the heart by the pulmonary veins, which open into the left auricle; from the left auricle the blood passes into the left ventricle, and from the left ventricle is distributed, by the aorta and its subdivisions, through the entire body. This constitutes the circulation of the blood in the adult. The division of the heart into four cavities is indicated by grooves upon its surface. The great transverse groove separating the auricles from the ventricles is called the auriculo-ventricular groove. It is deficient, in front, from being crossed by the root of the pulmonary artery. It contains the trunks of the nutrient vessels of the heart. The auricular portion occupies the base of the heart, and is subdivided into two cavities by a median septum. The two ventricles are also separated into a right and left, by two longitudinal furrow\s, the inter- ventricular grooves, which are situated one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface; these extend from the base to the apex of the organ; the former being situated nearer to the left border of the heart, and the latter to the right. It follows, therefore, that the right ventricle forms the greater portion of the anterior surface of the heart, and the left ventricle more of its posterior surface. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. To examine the interior of the right auricle, an incision should be made along its right border, from the entrance of the superior vena cava to that of the inferior. A second cut is to be made from the centre of this first incision to the tip of the auricular appendix and the flaps raised. The Right Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line ; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts : a principal cavity, or sinus venosus, and an appendix auriculcE. The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two venae cavae ; its walls are extremely thin ; it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix auriculce, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular pouch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the aorta.THE THORAX 954 The internal surface of the right auricle is smooth, except in the appendix and adjacent part of the anterior wall of the sinus venosus, where it is thrown into parallel ridges. It presents the following parts for examination :— Superior cava. Inferior cava. Openings -l Coronary sinus. Valves Foramina Thebesii. ^Auriculo-ventricular.

Fig. 563.—The right auricle and ventricle laid open, the anterior walls of both being removed. auriculo-ventricular aliening The stqjerior vena cava returns the blood from the upper half of the body, and opens into the upper and back part of the auricle, the direction of its orifice being downwards and forwards. The inferior vena cava, larger than the superior, returns the blood from the lower half of the body, and opens into the lowest part of the auricle, near the septum, the direction of its orifice being upwards and inwards. The direction of a current of blood through the superior vena cava would consequently be towards the auriculo-ventricular orifice ; whilst the direction of the blood through the mferior cava would be towards the auricular septum. This is the normal direction of the two currents in foetal life. The tuberculum Loweri is a small projection on the right wall of the auricle, between the two venas cavae. It is most distinct in the hearts of quadrupeds ; in man it is scarcely visible. It was supposed by Lower to direct the blood from the superior cava towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. The coronary sinus opens into the auricle, between the inferior vena cava and955 HEART—RIGHT VENTRICLE the auriculo-ventricular opening. It returns the blood from the substance of the heart, and is protected by a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, the coronary valve. The sinus, before entering the auricle, is considerably dilated —nearly to the size of the end of the little finger. Its wall is partly muscular, and, at its junction with the great coronary vein, is somewhat constricted, and furnished with a valve, consisting of two unequal segments. The foramina Thebesii are numerous minute apertures, the mouths of small veins (vence cordis minimce), which open on various parts of the inner surface of the auricle. They return the blood directly from the muscular substance of the heart. Some of these foramina are minute depressions in the walls of the heart, presenting a closed extremity. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and the ventricle, to be presently described. The Eustachian valve is situated between the anterior margin of the inferior vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular orifice. It is semilunar in form, its convex margin being attached to the wall of the vein ; its concave margin, which is free, terminating in two cornua, of which the left is attached to the anterior edge of the annulus ovalis ; the right being lost on the wall of the auricle. The valve is formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane of the auricle, containing a few muscular fibres. In the foetus this valve is of large size, and serves to direct the blood from the inferior vena cava, through the foramen ovale, into the left auricle. In the adult it is occasionally persistent, and may assist in preventing the reflux of blood into the inferior vena cava; more commonly it is small, and its free margin presents a cribriform or filamentous appearance ; occasionally it is altogether wanting. The coronary valve (valve of Thebesius) is a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, protecting the orifice of the coronary sinus. It prevents the regurgitation of blood into the sinus during the contraction of the auricle. This valve is occasionally double. The fossa ovalis is an oval depression, corresponding to the situation of the foramen ovale in the foetus. It is situated at the lower part of the septum auricu- larum, above and to the left of the orifice of the inferior vena cava. The annulus ovalis is the prominent oval margin of the foramen ovale. It is most distinct above, and at the sides ; below, it is deficient. A small slit-like valvular opening is occasionally found, at the upper margin of the fossa ovalis, which leads upwards, beneath the annulus, into the left auricle, and is the remains of the aperture between the two auricles in the foetus. The musculi pectinati are small, prominent muscular columns, which run across the inner surface of the appendix auriculae and adjoining portion of the wall of the sinus. They have received the name pectinati from the fancied resemblance they bear to the teeth of a comb. The Right Ventricle is triangular in form, and extends from the right auricle to near the apex of the heart. Its anterior or upper surface is rounded and convex, and forms the larger part of the front of the heart. Its under surface is flattened, rests upon the Diaphragm, and forms only a small part of the back of the heart. Its posterior wall is formed by the partition between the two ventricles, the septum ventriculorum, the surface of which is convex, and bulges into the cavity of the right ventricle. Its upper and inner angle is prolonged into a conical pouch, the infundibulum, or conus arteriosus, from which the pulmonary artery arises. The walls of the right ventricle are thinner than those of the left, the proportion between them being as i to 3. The wall is thickest at the base, and gradually becomes thinner towards the apex. The cavity, which equals that of the left ventricle, is capable of containing about three fluid ounces.* * Morrant Baker says that, ' taking the mean of various estimates, it may be inferred that each ventricle is able to contain four to six ounces of blood.'—Kirke's Physiology, loth edition, p. 156.THE THORAX 956 To examine the interior of the right ventricle, an incision should be made a little to the right of the anterior interventricular groove from the pulmonary artery to the apex of the heart, and should be carried up from thence a little to the right of the posterior interventricular groove, as far as the auriculo-ventricular opening. The folloAving parts present themselves for examination :— . (Auriculo-ventricular. ^ i Opening of the pulmonary artery. Valves . J Tricuspid. i bemiiunar. And a muscular and tendinous apparatus connected with the tricuspid valve :— Columnse carneae. Chordae tendinese. The auriculo-ventricular orifice is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is situated at the base of the ventricle, near the right border of the heart. The opening is about an inch in diameter,* oval from side to side, surrounded by a fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane of the heart, and rather larger than the corresponding aperture on the left side, being sufficiently large to admit the ends of four fingers. It is guarded by the tricuspid valve. The opening of the jmlmonary artery is circular in form, and situated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, close to the septum ventriculorum. It is placed on the left side of the auriculo-ventricular opening, upon the anterior aspect of the heart. Its orifice is guarded by the pulmonary semilunar valves. The tricuspid valve consists of three segments of a triangular or trapezoidal shape, formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane of the heart, strengthened by a layer of fibrous tissue, and containing, according to Kiirschner and Senac, muscular fibres. These segments are connected by their bases to the auriculo- ventricular orifice, and by their sides with one another, so as to form a continuous annular membrane, which is attached round the margin of the auriculo-ventricular opening, their free margins and ventricular surfaces affording attachment to a number of delicate tendinous cords, the chordce tendinece. The largest and most movable segment is placed towards the left side of the auriculo-ventricular opening, interposed between that opening and the pulmonary artery. Another segment corresponds to the front of the ventricle; and a third to its posterior Avail. The central part of each segment is thick and strong: the lateral margins are thin and indented. The chordae tendineae are connected with the adjacent margins of the principal segments of the valve, and are further attached to each segment in the folloAving manner : i. Three or four reach the attached margin of each segment, where they are continuous with the auriculo-ventricular tendinous ring. 2. Others, four to six in number, are attached to the central thickened part of each segment. 3. The most numerous and finest are connected with the marginal portion of each segment. The columncB carnece are the rounded muscular columns which project from nearly the whole of the inner surface of the ventricle, excepting near the opening of the pulmonary artery, where the wall becomes smooth. They may be classified, according to their mode of connection with the ventricle, into three sets. The first set merely form prominent ridges on the inner surface of the ventricle, being attached by their entire length on one side, as well as by their extremities. The second set are attached by their two extremities, but are free in the rest of their * In the Pathological Transactions, vol. vi. p. 119, Dr. Peacock has given some carefiil researches upon the weight and dimensions of the heart in health and disease. He states, as the result of his investigations, that, in the healthy adult heart, the right auriculo-ventricular aperture has a mean circumference of 54*4 lines, or 4|£ inches; the left auriculo-ventricular aperture a mean circumference of 44*3 lines, or 2)Vi inches ; the pulmonic orifice of 40 lines, or 2>2^ inches; and the aortic orifice of 35*5 lines, or 3/5 inches ; but the dimensions of the orifices varied greatly in different cases, the auriculo- ventricular aperture having a range of from 45 to 60 lines, and the others in the same proportion.HEART^LEFT AURICLE 957 extent; whilst the third set {muscidi 2)a2nllares), three or four in number, are attached by one extremity to the wall of the heart, the opposite extremity giving attachment to the chordc& tendinecB. The semilunar valves, three in number,* guard the orifice of the pulmonary artery. They consist of three semicircular folds, two anterior (right and left) and one posterior, formed by a duplicature of the lining~membrano, stren^tliened by IS'S'oSs tissue'. They are attached, by their convex margins, to the wall of the artery, at its junction with the ventricle, the straight border being free, and directed upwards in the course of the vessel, against the sides of which the valve-flaps are pressed during the passage of the blood along the artery. The free margin of each is somewhat thicker than the rest of the valve, is strengthened by a bundle of tendinous fibres, and presents, at its middle, a small projecting thickened nodule, called corpus Arajitii.^ From this nodule tendinous fibres radiate through the valve to its attached margin, and these fibres form a constituent part of its substance throughout its whole extent, excepting two narrow lunated portions, placed on each side of the nodule immediately behind the free margin ; here the valve is thin, and formed merely by the lining membrane. During the passage of the blood along the pulmonary artery these valves are pressed against the sides of the cylinder, and the course of the blood along the tube is uninterrupted; but during the ventricular diastole, when the current of blood along the pulmonary artery is checked, and partly thrown back by its elastic walls, these valves become immediately expanded, and effectually close the entrance of the tube. When the valves are closed, the lunated portions of each are brought into contact with one another by their opposed surfaces, the three corpora Arantii filling up the small triangular space that would be otherwise left by the approximation of the three semilunar valves. Between the semilunar valves and the commencement of the pulmonary artery are three pouches or dilatations, one behind each valve. These are the pulmonary sinuses {sinuses of Valsalva). Similar sinuses exist between the semilunar valves ajtid^'Oie'cbnTme^^ of the aortaythey are larger than the pulmonary sinuses. The blood, in its regurgitation towards the heart, finds its way into these sinuses, and so shuts down the valve-flapst. In order to examine the interior of the left auricle, make an incision on the posterior surface of the auricle from the pulmonary veins on one side to those on the other, the incision being carried a little way into the vessels. Make another incision from the middle of the horizontal one to the appendix. The Left Auricle is rather smaller than the right; its walls thicker, measuring about one line and a half ; it consists, like the right, of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculae. The simts is cuboidal in form, and concealed, in front, by the pulmonary artery and aorta; internally, it is separated from the right auricle by the septum auricu- larum ; behind, it receives on each side the pulmonary veins, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix auriculce is somewhat constricted at its junction with the auricle ; it is longer, narrower, and more curved than that of the right side, and its margins more deeply indented, presenting a kind of foliated appearance. Its direction is * The pulmonary semilunar valves have been found to be two in number instead of three (Dr. Hand, of St. Paul, Minn., in the NortJi-Western Med. and Surg. Journ., July 1873), and the same variety is more frequently noticed in the aortic semilunar valves. t In former editions, as well as in other text-books on anatomy, these little nodules have been described as fibro-cartilaginous in structure. At my request, Dr. Le Cronier Lancaster, Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. George's Hospital, has investigated this subject, and reports that the ' corpora Arantii ' appear to consist of bimdles of interlacing connective-tissue fibres with branched connective-tissue cells, and some few elastic fibres. Occasionally a roimded cell, with indistinct capsule, resembling a cartilage-cell, was seen ; but there were not many of them. At the free edge of the corpus the structure is denser, there being a larger proportion of fibres to cells than in the central portion. He thinks the structure of the corpus should be put down as fibrous and not fibro-cartilaginous.THE THORAX 958 forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. %The following parts present themselves for examination :— The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectinati. The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side (see note, page 956). Fig. 564.—The left auricle and ventricle laid open, the posterior walls of both bemg removed. The musculi pectinati are fewer in number and smaller than on the right side ; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum auricularum may be seen a lunated impression, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned upwards. The depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. To exannne the interior of the left ventricle, make an incision a little to the left of the anterior interventricular groove from the base to the apex of the heart, and carry it up from thence a little to the left of the posterior interventricular groove, nearly as far as the auriculo-ventricular groove. The Left Ventricle is longer and more conical in shape than the right ventricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the heart by its projection beyond the right ventricle. Its walls are much thicker than those of the right side, the proportion being as 3 to i. They are also thickest in the broadest part of the ventricle, becoming gradually thinner towards the base, and also towards the apex, which is the thinnest part.STRUCTUEE OF THE HEART 959 The following parts present themselves for examination :— ^ . fAuriciilo-ventricular. ' , (Mitral. Openings Valves [semilunar. Chordae tendineae. CohimneB carnese. The auriculo-ventricular opening is placed below and to the left of the aortic orifice. It is a little smaller than the corresponding aperture of the opposite side; and, like it, is broader in the transverse than in the antero-posterior diameter. It is surrounded by a dense fibrous ring, covered by the lining membrane of the heart, and guarded by the mitral valve. The aortic opening is a circular aperture, in front and to the right side of the auriculo-ventricular, from which it is separated by one of the segments of the mitral valve. Its orifice is guarded by the semilunar valves. The mitral valve is attached to the circumference of the auriculo-ventricular orifice in the same way that the tricuspid valve is on the opposite side. It is formed by a duplicature of the lining membrane, strengthened by fibrous tissue, and contains a few muscular fibres. It is larger in size, thicker, and altogether stronger than the tricuspid, and consists of two segments of unequal size. The larger segment is placed in front, between the auriculo-ventricular and aortic orifices, and is said to prevent the filling of the aorta during the distension of the ventricle. Two smaller segments are usually found at the angles of junction of the larger. The mitral valve-flaps are furnished with chords tendineae, the mode of attachment of which is precisely similar to that of those on the right side ; but they are thicker, stronger, and less numerous. The semilunar valves surround the orifice of the aorta ; two are posterior (right and left) and one anterior: they are similar in structure, and in their mode of attachment, to those of the pulmonary artery. They are, however, larger, thicker, and stronger than those of the right side; the lunulas are more distinct, and the corpora Arantii larger and more prominent. Between each valve and the cylinder of the aorta is a deep depression, the sinus aortici (sinuses, of„„V.alsalva); they are larger than those of the root of the pulmonary artery. The columncB carnece admit of a subdivision into three sets, like those upon the right side; but they are smaller, more numerous, and present a dense interlace- ment, especially at the apex, and upon the posterior wall. Those attached by one extremity only, the musculi papillares, are two in number, being connected one to the anterior, the other to the posterior wall; they are of large size, and terminate by free rounded extremities, from which the chordae tendineae arise. The septum between the two ventricles is thick, especially below (fig. 565). At its upper part it suddenly tapers off and becomes destitute of muscular fibres, consisting only of fibrous tissue, covered by two layers of endocardium ; and on the right side also covered by one of the flaps of the tricuspid valve. It is continued upwards and forms the septum between the aortic vestibule and the right auricle. It is derived from the lower part of the aortic septum of the foetus, and an abnormal communication may exist at this part owing to defective development of this septum. The Endocardium is a thin membrane which lines the internal surface of the heart; it assists in forming the valves by its reduplications, and is continuous with the lining membrane of the great blood-vessels. It is a smooth, transparent membrane, giving to the inner surface of the heart its glistening appearance. It is more opaque on the left than on the right side of the heart, thicker in the auricles than in the ventricles, and thickest in the left auricle. It is thin on the musculi pectinati, and on the columnas carneae ; but thicker on the smooth part of the auricular and ventricular walls, and on the tips of the musculi papillares. Structure.—The heart consists of muscular fibres, and of fibrous rings which serve for their attachment. Th.Q fibrous rings surround the auriculo-ventricular and arterial orifices : they are stronger upon the left than on the right side of the heart. The auriculo-ventricular rings serve for the attachment of the muscular fibres of the auricles and ventricles.THE THORAX 960 and also for the mitral and tricuspid valves; the ring on the left side is closely connected, by its right margin, with the aortic arterial ring. Between these and the right auriculo-ventricular ring is a mass of fibrous tissue ; and in some of the larger animals, as the ox and elephant, a nodule of bone. The fibrous rings surrounding the arterial orifices serve for the attachment of the great vessels and semilunar valves. Each ring receives, by its ventricular margin, the attachment of the muscular fibres of the ventricles; its opposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, within which the middle coat of the artery (which presents three convex semicircular segments) is firmly fixed; the attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring being strengthened by the thin cellular coat and serous membrane externally, and by the endocardium within. It is opposite the margins of these semicircular notches, in the arterial rings, that the endocardium, Fi&. 565.—Section of the heart, showing the interauricnlar and interventricular septa. by its reduphcation, forms the semilunar valves, the fibrous structure of the ring being continued into each of the segments of the valve at this part. The middle coat of the artery in this situation is thin, and the sides of the vessel are dilated to form the sinuses of Valsalva. The muscular structure of the heart consists of bands of fibres, which present an exceedingly intricate interlacement. They are of a deep red colour, and marked with transverse stride (page 35). The muscular fibres of the heart admit of a subdivision into two kinds, those of the auricles and those of the ventricles, which are quite independent of one another. Fibres of the Auricles.—These are disposed in two layers—a superficial layer common to both cavities, and a deep layer proper to each. The superficial fibres are more distinct on the anterior surface of the auricles, across the bases of which961 STRUCTUEE OF THE HEART they ran in a transverse direction, forming a thin but incomplete layer. Some of these fibres pass into the septum auricularum. The internal or deep fibres proper to each auricle consist of two sets, looped and annular fibres. The looped fibres pass upwards over each auricle, being attached by two extremities to the corre- sponding auriculo-ventricular rings, in front and behind. The annular fibres surround the whole extent of the appendices auricularum, and are continued upon the walls of the venae cav^e and coronary sinus on the right side, and upon the pulmonary veins on the left side, at their connection with the heart. In the appendices they interlace with the longitudinal fibres. The fibres of the ventricles are arranged in an exceedingly complex manner, and the accounts given by various anatomists differ considerably. This is probably due, partly, to the fact that the various layers of muscular fibre of which the heart is said to be composed are not independent, but their fibres are interlaced to a considerable extent, and therefore any separation into layers must be to a great extent artificial, and also no doubt partly due to the fact, pointed out by Henle, that there are varieties in the arrangement due to individual differences. If the epicardium (visceral layer of pericardium) and the subjacent fat is removed from a heart which has been subjected to prolonged boiling, so as to dissolve the connective tissues, the superficial fibres of the ventricles will be exposed. They will be seen to commence at the base of the heart, where they are attached to the tendinous rings around the orifices, and to pass obliquely downwards towards the apex, with a direction from right to left. At the apex the fibres turn suddenly inwards, forming what is called the vortex, into the,interior of the ventricle. On the back of the heart it will be seen that the fibres pass continuously from one ventricle to the other over the interventricular groove ; and the same thing will be noticed on the front of the heart at the upper and lower end of the anterior interventricular groove, but in the middle portion of this groove the fibres passing from one ventricle to the other are interrupted by fibres emerging from the septum along the groove ; many of the superficial fibres pass in also at this groove to the septum. The vortex is produced, as stated above, by the sudden turning inwards of the superficial fibres in a peculiar spiral manner into the interior of the ventricle. Those fibres, which ^descended on the posterior surface of the heart, enter, at the vortex, the left ventricle and, ascending, form the posterior part of the inner layer of muscular fibres lining this cavity and the right (posterior) musculus papillaris ; those fibres which descend on the front of the heart, and which pass to the apex, also pass, at the vortex, into the interior of the ventricle, where they form the remainder of the innermost layer of the ventricle and the left (anterior) musculus papillaris. The fibres forming the inner layer of the wall of the ventricle ascend to be attached to the fibrous rings around the orifices. By dissection these superficial fibres may be removed as a thin stratum, and it will then be found that the ventricles are made up of oblique fibres, superimposed in layers one on the top of another, and assuming gradually a less oblique direction as they pass to the middle of the thickness of the ventricular wall, so that in the centre of the wall the fibres are transverse. Internal to this central transverse layer the fibres become oblique again, but in the opposite direction to the external ones. This division into distinct layers is, however, to a great extent artificial, as the fibres pass across from one layer to another, and have therefore to be divided in the dissection, and the change in the direction of the fibres is very gradual. These oblique fibres commence above at the fibrous rings at the base of the heart, and descending towards the apex they enter the septum near its lower end. In the septum the fibres which form the left ventricle may be traced in three directions. I. Some pass upwards to be attached to the central fibro-cartilage. 2. Others pass through the septum to become continuous with the fibres of the right ventricle. 3. And the remainder pass through the septum to encircle the ventricle as annular fibres. Of the fibres of the right ventricle, some on entering the septum pass upwards to be attached to the central fibro-cartilage; some entering the septum from behind pass forwards to become continuous with the fibres on the anterior 3QTHE THORAX 962 surface of the left ventricle; and others entering in front pass backwards to join the fibres on the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The septum therefore consists of three varieties of fibres : viz. annular fibres special to the left ventricle; ascending fibres, derived from both ventricles and ascending through the septum to the central fibro-cartilage ; and decussating fibres derived from the anterior wall of one ventricle and passing to the posterior wall of the other ventricle, or from the posterior wall of the right ventricle and passing to the anterior wall of the left. In addition to these fibres, there are a considerable number which appear to encircle both ventricles and which pass across the septum without turning into it. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the heart are the left or anterior and right or posterior coronary (page 522). The veins accompany the arteries, and terminate in the right auricle. They are, the anterior, posterior, left and right cardiac veins, the right or small, and the left or great, coronary sinuses and the venae cordis minimae {vence Tliehesii) (page 659). The lymphatics terminate in the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts. The nerves are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which are formed partly from the cranial nerves, and partly from the sympathetic. They are freely distributed both on the surface and in the substance of the heart, the separate filaments being furnished with small ganglia. Surface Form.—In order to show the extent of the heart in relation to the front of the chest, draw a line from the lower border of the second left costal cartilage, one inch from the sternum, to the upper border of the third right costal cartilage, half an inch from the sternum. This represents the base line, or upper limit of the organ. Take a point an inch and a half below, and three-quarters of an inch internal to the left nipple, that is, about three and a half inches to the left of the median line of the body. This represents the apex of the heart. Draw a line from this apex point, with a slight convexity downwards, to the junction of the seventh right costal cartilage to the sternum. This represents the lower limit of the heart. Join tlie right extremity of the first line—that is, the base line—with the right extremity of this line—that is, to the seventh right chondro-sternal joint—with a slight curve outwards, so that it projects about an inch and a half from the middle line of the sternum. Lastly, join the left extremity of the base line and the apex point by a line curved slightly to the left. The position of the various orifices is as follows : viz. the pulmonary orifice is situated in the upper angle formed by the articulation of the third left costal cartilage with the sternum ; the aortic orifice is a little below and internal to this, behind the left border of the sternum, close to the articulation of the third left costal cartilage to this bone. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is behind the sternum, rather to the left of the median line and opposite the fourth costal cartilages. The right auriculo-ventricular opening is a little lower, opposite the fourth interspace and in the middle line of the body. A portion of the area of the heart thus mapped out is uncovered by lung, and therefore gives a dull note on percussion ; the remainder, being overlapped by the lung, gives a more or less resonant note. The former is known as the area of superficial cardiac dulness; the latter, as the area of deep cardiac dulness. The area of superficial cardiac dulness is included between a line drawn from the centre of the sternum between the fourth costal cartilages to the apex of the heart, and a line drawn from the same point down the lower third of the middle line of the sternum. Below, this area merges into the dulness which corresponds to the liver. Dr. Latham lays down the following rule as a sufficient practical guide for the definition of the portion of the heart which is uncovered by lung or pleura : ' Make a circle of two inches in diameter round a point midway between the nipple and the end of the sternum;' that is, the gladiolus. Peculiakities in the Vascular System of the Fcetus The chief peculiarities in the heart of the foetus are the direct communication between the two auricles through the foramen ovale, and the large size of the Eustachian valve. There are also several minor peculiarities. Thus, the position of the heart is vertical until the fourth month, when it commences to assume an oblique direction. Its size is also very considerable as compared with the body, the proportion at the second month being i to 50 ; at birth it is as i to 120 ; whilst in the adult the average is about i to 160. At an early period of foetal life the auricular portion of the heart is larger than the ventricular, the right auricle being more capacious than the left; but towards birth the ventricular portion becomes963 FCETAL CIRCULATION the larger. The thickness of both ventricles is, at first, about equal, but towards birth the lett becomes much the thicker of the two. The foramen ovale is situated at the lower and back part of the septum auricu- larum, forming a communication between the auricles. It remains as a free oval opening, from the time of the formation of the auricular septum (about the eighth week) until the middle period of foetal life. About this period a fold grows up from the posterior wall of the auricle, to the left of the foramen ovale, and advances over the opening, so as to form a sort of valve, which allows the blood to pass only from the right to the left auricle, and not in the opposite direction. The Eustachian valve is developed from the anterior border of the inferior vena cava at its entrance into the auricle. It is directed upwards on the left side of the opening of this vein, and serves to direct the blood from the inferior vena cava through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. The peculiarities in the arterial system of the foetus are the communication between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta by means of the ductus arteriosus, and the communication between the internal iliac arteries and the placenta by means of the umbilical arteries. The ductus arteriosus is a short tube, about half an inch in length at birth, and of the diameter of a goose-quill. In the early condition it forms the continuation of the pulmonary artery, and opens into the descending aorta, just below the origin of the left subclavian artery ; and so conducts the chief part of the blood from the right ventricle into this vessel. When the branches of the pulmonary artery have become larger relatively to the ductus arteriosus, the latter is chiefly connected to the left pulmonary artery ; and the fibrous cord, Avhich is all that remains of the ductus arteriosus in'later life, will be found to be attached to the root of that vessel. The umbilical or hypogastric arteries arise from the internal iliacs, in addition to the branches given off from those vessels in the adult. Ascending along the sides of the bladder to its fundus, they pass out of the abdomen at the umbilicus, and are continued along the umbilical cord to the placenta, coiling round the umbilical vein. They return to the placenta the blood which has circulated in the system of the foetus. The peculiarity in the venous system of the foetus is the communication esta- blished between the placenta and the liver and portal vein, through the umbilical vein ; and the inferior vena cava through the ductus venosus. FcETAL Circulation The blood destined for the nutrition of the foetus is carried from the placenta to the foetus, along the umbilical cord, by the umbilical vein. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus, and passes upwards along the free margin ofjthe suspensory ligament of the liver to the under surface of that organ, where it gives off two or three branches to the left lobe, one of which is of large size ; and others to the lobus quadratus and lobulus Spigelii. At the transverse fissure it divides into two branches : of these, the larger is joined by the portal vein, and enters the right lobe ; the smaller branch continues onwards, under the name of the ductus venosus, and joins the left hepatic vein at the point of junction of that vessel with the inferior vena cava. The blood, therefore, which traverses the umbilical vein, reaches the inferior vena cava in three different ways. The greater quantity circulates through the liver with the portal venous blood, before entering the vena cava by the hepatic veins ; some enters the liver directly, and is also returned to the inferior cava by the hepatic veins : the smaller quantity passes directly into the vena cava, by the junction of the ductus venosus with the left hepatic vein. In the inferior cava, the blood carried by the ductus venosus and hepatic veins becomes mixed with that returning from the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen. It enters the right auricle, and, guided by the Eustachian valve, passes 3 Q 2964 THE THOEAX through the foramen ovale into the left auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood returned from the lungs by the pulmonary veins. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle; and from the left ventricle into the aorta, by means of which it is distributed almost entirely to the head and Fig. 566.—Plan of the foetal circulation. In this plan the figured arrows represent the kind of blood, as well as the direction which it takes in the vessels. Tl)us—arterial blood is figured ^ ^ ; venous blood, > : mixed (arterial and venous) blood, » ^ upper extremities, a small quantity being probably carried into the descending aorta. From the head and upper extremities the blood is returned by the branches of the superior vena cava to the right auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small portion of the blood from the inferior cava. From the right auricle it descends over the Eustachian valve into the right ventricle; and, from the right ventricle,965 CHANGES IN VASCULAR SYSTEM AT BIRTH passes into the pulmonary artery. The kmgs of the fcetus being solid, and almost impervious, only a small quantity of the blood of the pulmonary artery is distri- buted to them, by the right and left pulmonary arteries, and is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle : the greater part passes through the ductus arteriosus into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood transmitted by the left ventricle into the aorta. Along this vessel it descends to supply the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, the chief portion being, however, conveyed by the umbilical arteries to the placenta. From the preceding account of the circulation of the blood in the foetus, it will be seen—• 1. That the placenta serves the double purpose of a respiratory and nutri- tive organ, receiving the venous blood from the foetus, and returning it again re-oxygenated, and charged with additional nutritive material. 2. That nearly the whole of the blood of the umbilical vein traverses the liver before entering the inferior cava ; hence the large size of this organ, especially at an early period of foetal life. 3. That the right auricle is the point of meeting of a double current, the blood in the inferior cava being guided by the Eustachian valve into the left auricle, whilst that in the superior cava descends into the right ventricle. At an early period of foetal life it is highly probable that the two streams are quite distinct; for the inferior cava opens almost directly into the left auricle, and the Eustachian valve would exclude the current along the vein from entering the right ventricle. At a later period, as the separation between the two auricles becomes more distinct, it seems j)robable that some mixture of the two streams must take place. 4. The blood carried from the placenta to the foetus by the umbilical vein, mixed with the blood from the inferior cava, passes almost dhectly to the arch of the aorta, and is distributed by the branches of that vessel to the head and upper extremities : hence the large size and perfect development of those parts at birth. 5. The blood contained in the descending aorta, chiefly derived from that which has already circulated through the head and limbs, together with a small quantity from the left ventricle, is distributed to the lower extremities : hence the small size and imperfect development of these parts at birth. Changes in the Vasculak System at Bieth At birth, when respiration is established, an increased amount of blood from the pulmonary artery passes through the lungs, which now perform their office as respiratory organs, and, at the same time, the placental circulation is cut off. The foramen ovale becomes gradually closed by about the tenth day after birth ; the valvular fold above mentioned becomes adherent to the margins of the foramen for the greater part of its circumference, but above a slit-like opening is left between the two auricles which sometimes remains persistent. The ductus arteriosus begins to contract immediately after respiration is established, becomes completely closed from the fourth to the tenth day, and ultimately degenerates into an impervious cord, which serves to connect the left pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. Of tbe umbilical or hyijocjastric arteries, the portion continued on to the bladder from the trunk of the corresponding internal iliac remains pervious, as the superior vesical artery ; and the part between the fundus of the bladder and the umbilicus becomes obliterated between the second and fifth days after birth, and projects into the peritoneal sac, so as to form the two fossae of the peritoneum, spoken of in the section on the surgical anatomy of direct inguinal hernia. The umbilical vein and ductus venosus become completely obliterated between the second and fifth days after birth, and ultimately dwindle to fibrous cords ; the former becoming the round ligament of the hver, the latter the fibrous cord, which, in the adult, may be traced along the fissure of the ductus venosus.OEGANS OF VOICE AND EESPIEATION The Laeynx THE Larynx is the organ of voice, placed at the upper part of the air-passage. It is situated between the trachea and base of the tongue, at the upper and fore part of the neck, T\"here it forms a considerable projection m the middle hne. On either side of 'it he the great vessels of the neck ; behind, it forms part of the boundary of the pharynx, and is covered by the mucous membrane lining that cavity. The larynx is broad above, where it presents the form of a triangular box, flattened behind and at the sides, and bounded in front by a prominent vertical ridge. Below, it is narrow and cylindrical. It is composed of cartilages, which are connected together by ligaments and moved by numerous muscles : the interior is lined by mucous membrane, and supplied with vessels and nerves. The Cartilages of the Larynx are nine in number, three single, and three pairs ; Thyroid. Cricoid. Epiglottis. Fig. 567.—Side view of the thyi'oid and cricoid cartilas^es. Two Arytenoid. Two Cornicula Laryngis. Two Cuneiform. The Thyroid {dvpeo^, a shield) is the largest cartilage of the larynx. It con- sists of two lateral lamellae or alse, united at an acute angle in front, forming a vertical projection in the middle line which is prominent above, and called the pomum Adavii. This projection is sub- cutaneous, more distinct in the male than in the female, and occasionally separated from the integument by a bursa mucosa. Each lamella is quadrilateral in form. Its outer surface presents an oblique ridge, which passes do^Tiwards and forwards from a tubercle, situated near the root of the superior cornu. This ridge gives attachment to the Sterno- thyroid and Thyro-hyoid muscles, and the portion of cartilage included between it and the posterior border, to part of the Inferior constrictor muscle. The inner surface of each ala is smooth, slightly concave, and covered by mucous membrane above and behind ; but in front, in the receding angle formed by their junction, are attached the epi- glottis, the true and false vocal cords, the Thyro-arytenoid, and Thyro-epiglot- tidean muscles.967 CRICOID CARTILAGE EPIGLOTTIS The itpper border of the thyroid cartilage is sinuously curved, being concave at its posterior part, just in front of the superior cornu, then rising into a convex outline, which clips in front to form the sides of a notch in the middle Hne, immediately above the pomum Adami. This border gives attachment throughout its whole extent to the thyro-hyoid membrane. The loiver border is connected to the cricoid cartilage, in the median line, by the crico-thyroid membrane; and, on each side, by the Crico-thyroid muscle. The ^posterior borders, thick and rounded, terminate, above, ^m. 568.—The cartilages of the larynx, in the superior cornua; and, be- Posterior view, low, in the inferior cornua. The two superior cornua are long and narrow, directed upwards, back- wards, and inwards; and ter- minate in a conical extremity, which gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid ligament. The two inferior cornua are short and thick; they pass downwards, with a slight inclination forwards and inwards, and present, on their inner surfaces, a small oval ar- ticular facet for articulation with the side of the cricoid cartilage. The posterior border receives the insertion of the Stylo-pharyn- geus and Palato-pharyngeus muscles on each side. The Cricoid Cartilage is so called from its resemblance to a signet ring (KpUos, a ring). It is smaller, but thicker and stronger than the thyroid carti- lage, and forms the lower and back part of the cavity of the larynx. Its anterior half is narrow, convex, affording attachment in front and at the sides to the Crico-thyroid muscles, and, behind, to part of the Inferior constrictor. Its posterior half is very broad, both from side to side, and from above downwards ; it presents in the middle line a vertical ridge for the attachment of the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus; and on either side a broad depression for the Crico-arytenoideus posticus muscle. At the point of junction of the two halves of the cartilage on either side is a small round elevation, for articulation with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The lotuer border of the cricoid cartilage is horizontal, and connected to the upper ring of the trachea by fibrous membrane. Its upper border is directed obliquely upwards and backwards, owing to the great depth of its posterior surface. It gives attachment, in front, to the crico- Ciuieiform cartilage Cornicula laryngis /\ ARYTENOID Insertion of Crico-arytenoideus posticus et lateralis Arytenoid cartilages, base CRICOID Articular facet for arytenoid cartilage Articular facet for- inferior cornu of thyroid cartilageORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION 968 thyroid membrane ; at the sides, to part of the same membrane and to the lateral Crico-arytenoid muscle ; behind, the highest point of the upper border is sur- mounted on each side by a smooth oval surface, for articulation with the arytenoid cartilage. Between the articular surfaces is a slight notch, for the attachment of part of the Arytenoideus muscle. The inner surface of the cricoid cartilage is smooth, and lined by mucous membrane. The Arytenoid Cartilages are so called from the resemblance they bear, when approximated, to the mouth of a pitcher (dpvVatm, a pitcher). They are two in number, and situated at the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, at the back of the larynx. Each cartilage is pyramidal in form, and presents for examination three surfaces, a base, and an apex. The posterior surface is triangular, smooth, concave, and gives attachment to the Arytenoid muscle. The anterior surface, somewhat convex and rough, gives attachment to the Thyro-arytenoid muscle, and to the false vocal cord. The internal surface is narroAv, smooth, and flattened, covered by mucous membrane, and lies almost in apposition with the cartilage of the opposite side. The base of each cartilage is broad, and presents a concave smooth surface, for articulation with the cricoid cartilage. Of its three angles, the external is short, rounded, and prominent, receiving the insertion of the Posterior and Lateral crico-arytenoid muscles. The anterior angle, also prominent, but more pointed, gives attachment to the true vocal cord. This angle is sometimes called the vocal process. The apex of each cartilage is pointed, curved backwards and inwards, and surmounted by a small conical-shaped, cartilaginous nodule, the corniculum I'aryngis. The cornicula laryngis [cartilages of Santorini) are two small conical nodules, consisting of yellow fibro-cartilage, which articulate with the summit of the ary- tenoid cartilages and serve to prolong them backwards and inwards. To them are attached the aryteno-e]3iglottidean folds. They are sometimes united to the arytenoid cartilages. The cuneiform cartilages [cartilages of Wrisherg) are two small, elongated, cartilaginous bodies, placed one on each side, in the fold of mucous membrane which extends from the apex of the arytenoid cartilage to the side of the epiglottis [aryteno-epiglotticlean fold) ; they give rise to small whitish elevations on the inner surface of the mucous membrane, just in front of the arytenoid cartilages. The epiglottis is a thin lamella of fibro-cartilage, of a yellowish colour, shaped like a leaf, and placed behind the tongue in front of the superior opening of the larynx. During respiration its direction is vertically upwards, its free extremity curving forwards towards the base of the tongue ; but when the larynx is drawn up beneath the base of the tongue during deglutition, it is carried downwards and backwards, so as to completely close the opening of the larynx. Its free extremity is broad and rounded ; its attached end is long and narrow, and connected to the receding angle between the two alse of the thyroid cartilage, just below the median notch, by a long, narrow, ligamentous band, the thyro-epiglottic ligament. It is also connected to the posterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone by an elastic ligamentous band, the hyo-epiglottic ligament. Its anterior or lingual surface is curved forwards towards the tongue, and covered at its upper part by mucous membrane, which is reflected on to the sides and base of the organ, forming a median and two lateral folds, the glosso-epiglot- tidean ligaments. Its posterior or laryngeal surface is smooth, concave from side to side, concavo- convex from above downwards, and covered by mucous membrane ; when this is removed, the surface of the cartilage is seen to be studded with a number of small mucous glands, which are lodged in little pits upon its surface. To its sides the aryteno-epiglottidean folds are attached.LIGAMENTS 969 Structure.—The cornicula laryngis, cuneiform cartilages, and epiglottis are composed of yellow fibro-cartilage, which shows little tendency to calcification; but the other cartilages resemble in structure the costal cartilages, becoming more or less calcified in old age. Ligaments.—The ligaments of the larynx are extrinsic, i.e. those connecting the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis with the hyoid bone, and the cricoid cartilage with the trachea ; and iiitrinsic, those which connect the several cartilages of the larynx to each other. The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartilage with the hyoid bone are three in number—the thyro-hyoid membrane, and the two lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments. The thyro-hyoid membrane is a broad, fibro-elastic, membranous layer, attached below to the upper part of the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage, and above to the upper border of the hyoid bone, passing behind the posterior surface, and being separated from it by a synovial bursa. It is thicker in the middle line than at either side, in which situation it is pierced by the superior laryngeal vessels and nerve. The tiuo lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments are rounded, elastic cords, which pass between the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage and the extremities of the greater cornua of the hyoid bone. A small cartilaginous nodule (cartilago triticea), sometimes bony, is frequently found in each. The ligament connecting the epiglottis with the hyoid bone is the hyo-epigiottic. In addition to this extrinsic ligament, the epiglottis is connected to the tongue by the three glosso-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, which may also be considered as extrinsic ligaments of the epiglottis. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is an elastic fibrous band, which extends from the anterior surfa,ce of the epiglottis, near its apex, to the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone. The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartilage to the cricoid are also three in. number—the crico-thyroid membrane, and the capsular ligaments. The crico-thyroid membrane is composed mainly of yellow elastic tissue. It is of triangular shape ; thick in front, where it connects together the contiguous margins of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages ; thinner at each side, where it extends from the superior border of the cricoid cartilage to the inferior margin of the true vocal cords, with which it is closely united in front. The anterior portion of the crico-thyroid membrane is convex, concealed on each side by the Crico-thyroid muscle, subcutaneous in the middle line, and crossed horizontally by a small anastomotic arterial arch, formed by the junction of the two crico-thyroid arteries. The lateral portions are lined internally by mucous membrane, and covered by the lateral Crico-arytenoid and Thyro-arytenoid muscles. A cajjsidar ligament encloses the articulation of the inferior cornu of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage on each side. The articulation is lined by synovial membrane. The ligaments connecting the arytenoid cartilages to the cricoid are two capsular ligaments, and two posterior crico-arytenoid ligaments. The capsular crico-arytenoid ligaments are thin and loose capsules attached to the margin of the articular surfaces ; they are lined internally by synovial membrane. The posterior crico-arytenoid ligaments extend from the cricoid to the inner and back part of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The ligament connecting the epiglottis with the thyroid cartilage is the thyro- epiglottic. The thyro-epiglottic ligament is a long, slender, elastic cord which connects the apex of the epiglottis with the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage immediately beneath the median notch, above the attachment of the vocal cords. The crico-tracheal ligament connects the cricoid cartilage with the first ring of the trachea. It resembles the fibrous membrane which connects the cartilaginous rings of the trachea to each other.970 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION Interior of the Larynx.—The superior aperture of the larynx (fig. 569) is a triangular or cordiform opening, wide in front, narrow behind, and sloping obliquely downwards and backwards. It is bounded, in front, by the epiglottis; behind, by the apices of the arytenoid cartilages, and the cornicula laryngis ; and laterally, by a fold of mucous membrane, enclosing ligamentous and muscular fibres, stretched between the sides of the epiglottis and the apex of the arytenoid cartilages : these are the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, on the margins of which the^ cuneiform cartilages form a more or less distinct whitish prominence. The cavity of the larynx extends from the superior aperture to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. It is divided into two parts by the projection inwards of the vocal cords; between the two cords is a long and narrow triangular fissure or chink, the rima glottidis. The portion of the cavity of the larynx above the true vocal cords is broad and triangular in shape, and corresponds to the interval between the al^e of the thyroid cartilage ; it contains the false vocal cords, and between these and the true vocal cords are the ventricles of the larynx. The portion below the true vocal cords is at first of an elliptical, and lower down of a circular form. The rima glottidis is the narrow fissure or chink between the inferior or true vocal cords. It is the nar- rowest part of the cavity of the larynx, and corresponds to the lower level of the ary- tenoid cartilages. Its length, in the male, measures rather less than an inch ; its breadth, when dilated, varying at its widest part from a third to half an inch. In the female these measurements are less by two or three lines. The form of the rima glottidis varies. In its half-closed con- dition it is a narrow fissure, a little enlarged and rounded behind. In quiet breathing it is widely open, somewhat triangular, the base of the tri- angle directed backwards, and corresponding to the space between the separated arytenoid cartilages. In forcible expiration it is smaller than during inspiration. When sound is produced it is more narrowed, the margins of the arytenoid cartilages being brought into contact, and the edges of the vocal cords approximated and made parallel, the degree of approximation andj tension corresponding to the height of the note produced.* The superior or false vocal cords, so called because they are not directly concerned in the production of the voice, are two folds of mucous membrane, enclosing a delicate narrow fibrous band, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament. This ligament consists of a thin band of elastic tissue, attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage below the epiglottis, and behind to the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The lower border of this ligament, enclosed in mucous membrane, forms a free crescentic margin, which constitutes the upper boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. The inferior or triie vocal cords, so called from their being concerned in the production of sound, are two strong fibrous bands {inferior thyro-arytenoid * On the shape of the rima glottidis, in the various conditions of breathing and speaking, see Czermak, On the Lary^igoscope, translated for the Neio Sydenham Society. Fig. 569.—The larynx and adjacent parts, seen from above.MUSCLES OF LARYNX 971 ligaments), covered on their surface by a thin layer of mucous membrane. Each hgament consists of a band of yellow elastic tissue, attached in front to the depression between the two alffi of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid. Its lower border is continuous with the thin lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane. Its upper border forms the lower boundary of the ventricle of the larynx. Externally, the Thyro-arytenoideus muscle lies parallel with it. It is covered internally by mucous membrane, which is extremely thin, and closely adherent to its surface. The ventricle of the larynx is an oblong fossa, situated between the superior and inferior vocal cords on each side, and extending nearly their entire length. This fossa is bounded, above, by the free crescentic edge of the superior vocal cord ; below, by the straight margin of the true vocal cord; externally, by the corresponding Thyro-arytenoideus muscle. The anterior part of the ventricle leads up by a narrow opening into a csecal pouch of mucous membrane of variable size, called the laryngeal i^oiich. The sacculus laryngis, or laryngeal pouch, is a membranous sac, placed be- tween the superior vocal cord and the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, occasionally extending as far as its upper border: it is conical in form.

Glosso-epiglottic K^jQ Aryteno- epiglottic fold Vocal cords, ventricle between them Arytenoid cartilage irytenoideus muscle Crico-thyroid meiiihraue and curved slightly backwards, like a Phrygian cap. On the surface of its mucous membrane are the openings of sixty or seventy small follicular glands, which are lodged in the submucous areolar tissue. This sac is enclosed in a fibrous capsule, continuous below with the superior thyro-arytenoid liga- ment : its laryngeal surface is covered by the Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior muscle {Compressor sacculi laryngis, Hilton); whilst its exterior is covered by the Thyro-arytenoideus and Thyro- epiglottideus muscles. These muscles compress the sacculus laryngis, and discharge the secretion it contains upon the chordae vocales, the surfaces of which it is intended to lubricate. Muscles.—The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are nine in number ; six of which are the muscles of the vocal cords and rima glottidis; and three are con- nected with the enifflottis. The six muscles of the vocal cords and rima glottidis are—the' Crico-thyroid. Arytenoideus. Crico-arytenoideus posticus. Thyro-arytenoideus. Crico-arytenoideus lateralis. Arytenoideus rectus. The Crico-thyroid is triangular in form, and situated at the fore part and side of the cricoid cartilage. It arises from the front and lateral part of the cricoid cartilage; its fibres diverge, passing obliquely upwards and outwards, to be inserted into the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, and into the anterior border of the lower cornua. The inner borders of these two muscles are separated in the middle line by a triangular interval, occupied by the crico-thyroid membrane. The Crico-arytenoideus ■posticus arises from the broad depression occupying972 ORGAXS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION each lateral half of the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage ; its fibres pass upwards and outwards, converging to be inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The upper fibres are nearly horizontal, the middle obhque, and the lower almost ver- FiG. 571.—Muscles of larynx. Side view Eight ala of thyroid cartilage removed. Cornicu laryn Articular facet for inferior coriiii uj thyroid cartilage ticaL* The Crico-arytenoideus lateralis is smaller than the preceding, and of an oblong form. It arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and, passing ob- liquely upwards and backwards, is inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, in front of the preceding muscle. The Arytenoideus is a single muscle, filling up the posterior con- cave surface of the arytenoid carti- lages. It arises from the posterior surface and outer border of one arytenoid cartilage, and is inserted into the corresponding parts of the opposite cartilage. It consists of three i^lanes of fibres, two oblique and one transverse. The oblique fibres, the most superficial, form two fasciculi, which pass from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the opposite one. The transverse fibres, the deepest and most nume- rous, pass transversely across be- tween the two cartilages; hence the Arytenoideus was formerly con- sidered as several muscles, under the name of transversi and obliqtii. A few of the oblique fibres are occasionally continued round the outer margin of the cartilage, and blend with the Thyro-arytenoid or the Aryteno-epiglottideus muscle. The Thyro-arytenoideus is a broad, flat muscle, which lies parallel with the outer side of the true vocal cord. It arises in front from the lower half of the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and from the crico-thyroid membrane. * Dr. Merkel, of Leipsic, has descri- bed a muscular slip which occasionally extends between the outer border of the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage and the posterior margm of the inferior cornu of the thyroid; this he calls the ' Musculus kerato-cricoideus.' It is not found in every larynx, and when pre- sent exists usually only on one side, but is occasionally found on both sides. Sir Wm. Turner {Edinburgh Medical Journal, Feb. i860) states that it is found m about one case in five. Its action is to fix the lower horn of the thjTroid cartilage backwards and downwards, opposing in some measure the part of the Crico-thyroid muscle which is connected to the anterior margin of the horn. Fig. 572.- -Interior of the larynx, seen from above. (Enlarcred.)973 MUSCLES OF LARYNX Its fibres pass horizontally backwards and outwards, to be inserted into the base and anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage. This muscle consists of two fasciculi. The inner or inferior portion, the thicker, is inserted into the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, and into the adjacent portion of its anterior surface ; it lies parallel with the true vocal cord, to which it is adherent. The oiUer or superior fasciculus, the thinner, is inserted into the anterior surface and outer border of the arytenoid cartilage above the preceding fibres; it lies on the outer side of the sacculus laryngis, immediately beneath the mucous membrane.* Arytenoideus rectus.—This is a small, but fairly constant muscle, which was first described by Luschka, and named by him the Arytenoideus rectus. It is attached below to the posterior, concave surface of the arytenoid cartilage, beneath the Arytenoideus muscle, and, passing upwards, emerges at the upper border of this muscle, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the cartilage of Santorini.| The muscles of the epiglottis are, the Thyro-epiglottideus. Aryteno-epiglottideus superior. Aryteno-epigiottideus inferior. The Thyro-epiglottideus is a delicate fasciculus, which arises from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, just external to the origin of the Thyro-arytenoid muscle, and spreads out upon the outer surface of the sacculus laryngis : some of its fibres are lost in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold, whilst others are continued forwards to the margin of the epiglottis {Depressor epiglottidis). The Aryteno-epiglottideus superior consists of a few delicate muscular fasciculi, which arise from the apex of the arytenoid cartilages, and become lost in the fold of mucous membrane extending between the arytenoid cartilage and side of the epiglottis {aryteno-epiglottidean folds). The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior {Compressor sacculi laryngis, Hilton) arises from the arytenoid cartilage, just above the attachment of the superior vocal cord; passing forwards and upwards, it spreads out upon the anterior surface of the epiglottis. This muscle is separated from the preceding by an indistinct areolar interval.t Actions.—In considering the action of the muscles of the larynx, they may be conveniently divided into two groups, viz. : i. Those which open and close the glottis. 2. Those which regulate the degree of tension of the vocal cords. I. The muscles which open the glottis are the Crico-arytenoidei postici; and those which close it are the Arytenoideus and the Crico-arytenoidei laterales. 2. The muscles which regulate the tension of the vocal cords are the Crico- thyroidei, which tense and elongate them ; and the Thyro-arytenoidei, which relax and shorten them. The Thyro-epiglottideus is a depressor of the epiglottis, and the Aryteno-epiglottidei constrict the superior aperture of the larynx, compress the sacculi laryngis, and empty them of their contents. The Crico-arytenoidei postici separate the chordae vocales, and, consequently, open the glottis, by rotating the arytenoid cartilages outwards around a vertical axis passing through the crico-arytenoid joints; so that their anterior angles and the ligaments attached to them become widely separated, the vocal cords, at the same time, being made tense. The Crico-arytenoidei laterales close the glottis, by rotating the arytenoid cartilages inwardi:!, so as to approximate their anterior angles. The Arytenoideus muscles approximate the arytenoid cartilages, and thus close the opening of the glottis, especially at its back part. The Crico-thyroid muscles produce tension and elongation of the vocal cords. This * Henle describes these two portions as separate muscles, under the names of External and Internal thyro-arytenoid. + Anatomy, by Hyrtl, page 718. X MuscuLUS TRiTiCEO-GLOSSUS. Bochdalck jun. (Prager Vierteljahrsschrift, 2nd part, 1866) describes a muscle hitherto entirely overlooked, except a brief statement in Henle's Anatomy, which arises from the nodule of cartilage {coiyus triticeum) in the posterior thyro-hyoid ligament, and passes forwards and upwards to enter the tongue along with the Hyo-glossus muscle. He met with this muscle eight times in twenty-two subjects. It occurred in both sexes, sometimes on both sides, at others on one only.974 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION is effected as follows:—the thyroid cartilage is fixed by the Thyro-hyoid innscles, then the Crico-thyroid muscles, when the}^ act, draw upwards the front of the cricoid cartilage and so depress the posterior portion, which carries with it the arytenoid cartilages, and thus elongate the vocal cords. The Tliyro-arytenoidei muscles, consisting of two parts having different attachments and different directions, are rather complicated as regards their action. Their main use is to draw the arytenoid cartilages forwards towards the thyroid, and thus shorten and relax the vocal cords. But, owing to the connection of the inner portion with the vocal cord, this part, if acting separately, is supposed to modif}' its elasticity and tension, and the outer portion, being inserted into the outer part of the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage, may rotate it inwards, and thus narrow the rima glottidis by bringing the two cords together. The Thyro-ejnglottidei dej)ress the epiglottis, and assist in compressing the sacculi laryngis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus superior constricts the superior aperture of the larynx, when it is drawn upwards, during deglutition, and the opening closed by the epiglottis. The Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior, together with some fibres of the Thyro- arytenoidei, compress the sacculus laryngis. The Mucous Membrane of the Larynx is continuous above with that lining the mouth and pharynx, and is prolonged through the trachea and bronchi into the lungs. It lines the posterior and upper part of the anterior surface of the epiglottis, to which it is closely adherent, and forms the aryteno-epiglottidean folds which encircle the superior aperture of the larynx. It lines the whole of the cavity of the larynx ; forms, by its reduplication, the chief part of the superior, or false, vocal cord ; and, from the ventricle, is continued into the sacculus laryngis. It is then reflected over the true vocal cords, where it is thin, and very intimately adherent ; covers the inner surface of the crico-thyroid membrane and cricoid cartilage ; and is ultimately continuous with the lining membrane of the trachea. It is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium below the superior vocal cord ; but above this point the cilia are found only in front, as high as the middle of the epiglottis. In the rest of its extent the epithelium is of the squamous variety. Glands.—The mucous membrane of the larynx is furnished with numerous muciparous glands, the orifices of which are found in nearly every part; they are very numerous upon the epiglottis, being lodged in little pits in its substance; they are also found in large numbers along the posterior margin of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold, in front of the arytenoid cartilages, where they are termed the arytenoid glands. They exist also in large numbers upon the inner surface of the sacculus laryngis. None are found on the vocal cords. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins accompany the arteries : those accompanying the superior laryngeal artery join the superior thyroid vein, which opens into the internal jugular vein ; while those accompanying the inferior laryngeal artery join the inferior thyroid vein which opens into the innominate vein. The lymphatics terminate in the deep cervical glands. The nerves are the superior laryngeal, and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal branches of the pneumo- gastric nerves, joined by filaments from the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerves supply the mucous membrane of the larynx and the Crico-thyroid muscles. The inferior laryngeal nerves supply the remaining muscles. The Arytenoid muscle is supplied by both nerves. The Teachea (fig. 573) The trachea, or windpipe, is a cartilaginous and membranous cylindrical tube, flattened posteriorly, wdiich extends from the lower part of the larynx, on a level with the sixth cervical vertebra, to opposite the fourth, or sometimes the fifth, dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi, one for each lung. The trachea measures about four inches and a half in length ; its diameter, from side to side, is from three-quarters of an inch to an inch, being always greater in the male than in the female. Relations.—The anterior surface of the trachea is convex, and covered in the neck, from above downwards, by the isthmus of the thyroid gland, the inferiorTHE TRACHEA 975 thyroid veins, the arteria thyroidea ima (when that vessel exists), the Bterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the cervical fascia and, more superficially, by the anastomosing branches between the anterior jugular veins ; in the tho7'ax it is Fig. 573.—Front view of cartilages of larynx ; the trachea and bronchi. Fig. 574.—Transverse section of the trachea, just above its bifurcation with a bird's-eye view of the interior. covered from before backwards by the first piece of the sternum, the remains of the thymus gland, the left innominate vein, the arch of the aorta, the innominate and left carotid arteries, and the deep cardiac plexus. Posteriorly, it is in relation976 OEGANS OF VOICE AND EESPIRATION with the oesophagus ; laterally, in the neck, it is in relation with the common carotid arteries, the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid arteries, and recurrent laryngeal nerves; and, m the thorax, it lies in the space between the pleurae, having the pneumogastric nerve on each side of it. The Right Bronchus, wider, shorter, and more horizontal in direction than the left, is about an inch in length, and enters the right lung, opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra. The vena azygos major arches over it, from behind ; and the right pulmonary artery lies below, and then in front of it. The Left Bronchus is smaller, longer, and more oblique, than the right, being nearly two inches in length. It enters the root of the left lung, opposite the sixth dorsal vertebra, about an inch lower than the right bronchus. It passes beneath the arch of the aorta, crosses, in front of the oesophagus, the thoracic duct and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above, and then in front of it. If a transverse section is made across the trachea, a short distance above its point of bifurcation, and a bird's-eye view taken of its interior (fig. 574), the septum placed at the bottom of the trachea and separating the two bronchi will be seen to occupy the left of the median line, so that any solid body dropping into the trachea would naturally be directed towards the right bronchus. This tendency is aided by the larger size of the right tube as compared with its fellow. This fact serves to explain why a foreign body in the trachea generally falls into the right bronchus.* Structure.—The trachea is composed of imperfect cartilaginous rings, fibrous membrane, muscular fibres, longitudinal yellow elastic fibres, mucous membrane, and glands. The cartilages vary from sixteen to twenty in number : each forms an imper- fect ring, Avhich surrounds about two-thirds of the cylinder of the trachea, being- imperfect behind, where the tube is completed by fibrous membrane. The cartilages are placed horizontally above each other, separated by narrow membranous intervals. They measure about two lines in depth, and half a line in thickness. Their outer surfaces are flattened, but internally they are convex, from being thicker in the middle than at the margins. Two or more of the cartilages often unite, partially or completely, and are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. They are highly elastic, but sometimes become calcified in advanced life. In the right bronchus the cartilages vary in number from six to eight; in the left, from nine to twelve. They are shorter and narrower than those of the trachea. The peculiar cartilages are the first and the last. The first cartilage is broader than the rest, and sometimes divided at one end ; it is connected by fibrous membrane with the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, with which, or with the succeeding cartilage, it is sometimes blended. The last cartilage is thick and broad in the middle, in consequence of its lower border being prolonged into a triangular hook-shaped process, which curves down- wards and backwards between the two bronchi. It terminates on each side in an imperfect ring, which encloses the commencement of the bronchi. The cartilage above the last is somewhat broader than the rest at its centre. The fibrous membrane.—The cartilages are enclosed in an elastic fibrous membrane, which forms a double layer; one layer, the thicker of the two, passing over the outer surface of the ring, the other over the inner surface : at the upper and lower margins of the cartilages these two layers blend together to form a single membrane which connects the rings one with another. They are thus, as it were, embedded in the membrane. In the space behind, between the extremities of the rings., the membrane forms a single distinct layer. The muscular fibres are disposed in two layers, longitudinal and transverse. The longitudinal fibres are the most external, and arise by minute tendons from the inner surfaces of the ends of the tracheal cartilages, and from the fibrous membrane. * Eeigel asserts that the entry of a foreign body into the left bronchus is by no means so infrequent as is generally supposed.977 THE TRACHEA The transverse fibres (Trachealis muscle, Todd and Bowman), the most internal, form a thin layer, which extends transversely between the ends of the cartilages and the intervals between them at the posterior part of the trachea. The muscular fibres are of the unstriped variety. The elastic fibres form a complete lining to the entire cylinder of the trachea, external to the mucous membrane : they are most abundant at the posterior part of the tube between the extremities of the rings, where they are collected into distinct longitudinal bundles, and are especially numerous about the bifurcation of the trachea. They may be traced downwards as a continuous membrane to the ultimate ramifications of the bronchial tubes. The fibres are contained in a loose submucous tissue, which contains numerous mucous glands. The Mucous Membrane is continuous above with that of the larynx, and below with that of the bronchi. Microscopically, it presents a well-marked basement membrane, supporting a layer of columnar ciliated epithelium, between the deeper ends of which are smaller round or elongated cells. It contains a large amount of lymphoid tissue and some tracheal glands. The Tracheal Glands are found in great abundance at the posterior part of the trachea. They are small, flattened, ovoid bodies, placed upon the outer surface of the fibrous layer ; each is furnished with an excretory duct, which pierces the fibrous and muscular layers, and opens on the surface of the mucous membrane. Some glands of smaller size are also found at the sides of the trachea, between the layers of fibrous tissue connecting the rings, and others immediately beneath the mucous coat. The secretion from these glands serves to lubricate the inner surface of the trachea. Vessels and Nerves.— The trachea is supplied with blood by the inferior thyroid arteries. The veins terminate in the thyroid venous plexus. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastric and its recurrent branches, and from the sympa- thetic. Surface Form.—In the middle line of the neck, some of the cartilages of the larynx can be readily distinguished. In the receding angle below the chin, the hyoid bone can Fig. 575.—Surgical anatomy of laryngo-tracheal region. In the infant. Th/jroid body {isthmus)978 OKGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION prominence between the upper borders of the two alse of the thyroid cartilage. About an inch below this, in the middle line, is a depression corresponding to the crico-thyroid space, in which the operation of laryngotomy is performed. This depression is bounded below by a prominent arch, the anterior ring of the cricoid cartilage, below which the trachea can be felt, though it is only in the emaciated adult that the separate rings can be distinguished. The lower part of the trachea is not easily made out, for as it descends in the neck it takes a deeper position, and is farther removed from the surface. The level of the vocal cords corresponds to the middle of the anterior margin of the thyroid cartilage. With the laryngoscope the following structures can be seen: The base of the tongue, and the upper surface of the epiglottis, with the glosso-epiglottic ligaments ; the superior aperture of the larynx ; bounded on either side by the aryteno-epiglottidean ligaments, in which may be seen two rounded eminences, corresponding to the cornicula and cuneiform cartilages. Beneath these the true and false vocal cords, with the ventricle between them. Still deeper, the cricoid cartilage and some of the anterior parts of the rings of the trachea, and sometimes, in deep inspiration, the bifurcation of the trachea. Surgical Anatomy.—Foreign bodies often find their way into the air-passages. These may be either large soft substances, as a piece of meat, when they become lodged in the upper aperture of the larynx, or in the rima glottidis, and cause speedy suffocation unless rapidly got rid of, or unless an opening is made into the air-passages below, so as to enable the patient to breathe. Smaller bodies, and frequently of a hard nature, such as cherry or plum stones, small pieces of bone, buttons, etc., may find their way through the rima glottidis into the trachea or bronchus, or may become lodged in the ventricle of the larynx. The dangers then depend not so much upon the mechanical obstruction, as upon the spasm of the glottis which they excite from reflex irritation. When lodged in the ventricle of the larynx, they may produce very few symptoms beyond sudden loss ot voice or alteration in the voice sounds, immediately following the inhalation of the foreign body. When, however, they are situated in the trachea, they are constantly striking against the vocal cords during expiratory efforts, and produce attacks of dyspnoea from spasm of the glottis. When lodged in the bronchus, they usually become fixed there, and, occluding the lumen of the tube, cause a loss of the respiratory murmur on the affected side, which is, as stated above, usually the right. Beneath the mucous membrane of the upper part of the air-passages, there is a considerable amount of submucous tissue, which is liable to become much swollen from effusion in inflammatory afl'ections, constituting the disease known as ' oedema of the glottis.' This effusion does not extend below the level of the vocal cords, on account of the fact that the mucous membrane is closely adherent to these structures, without the intervention of any submucous tissue. So that, in cases of this disease, in w^hich it is necessary to open the air-passages to prevent suffocation, the operation of laryngotomy is sufficient. Chronic laryngitis is an inflammation of the mucous glands of the larynx, which occurs in those who speak much in public, and is known as ' Clergyman's sore throat.' It is due to the dryness induced by the large amount of cold air drawn into the air-passages during prolonged speaking, which excites increased activity of the mucous glands to keep the parts moist, and this eventually terminates in inflammation of these structures. Ulceration of the larynx may occur from syj)hilis, either superficial ulceration, or from the softening of a gumma : from tubercular disease (laryngeal phthisis), or from malignant disease (epithelioma). The air-passages may be opened in two different situations : through the crico-thyroid membrane {laryngotomy), or in some part of the trachea (tracheotomy) ; and to these some surgeons have added a third method, by opening the crico-thyroid membrane and dividing the cricoid cartilage with the upper ring of the trachea {lary72go-tracheotomy). The student should carefully consider the relative anatomy of the air-tube in each of these situations (fig. 575). Laryngotomy is anatomicall}' the most simple operation ; it can most readily be performed, and should always be preferred when particular circumstances do not render the operation of tracheotomy absolutely necessary. The crico-thyroid membrane is very superficial, being covered only in the middle line by the skin, superficial fascia, and the deep fascia. On each side of the middle line it is also covered by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, which diverge slightly from each other at their upper parts, leaving a slight interval between them. On these muscles rests the anterior jugular vein. The only vessel of any importance in connection with this operation is the crico-thyroid artery, which crosses the crico-thyroid membrane, and which may be wounded, but rarely gives rise to any trouble. The operation is performed thus : the head being thrown back and steadied by an assistant, the finger is passed over the front of the neck, and the crico- thyroid depression felt for. A vertical incision is then made through the skin, in the middle line over this spot, and carried down through the fascia until the crico-thyroid membrane is exposed. A cross cut is then made through the membrane, close to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, so as to avoid, if possible, the crico-thyroid artery, and a tracheotomy tube introduced. It has been recommended, as a more rapid way of performing the ox:)eration, to make a transverse instead of a longitudinal cut through the979 THE PLEUE^ superficial structures, and thus to open at once the air-passages. It will be seen, however, that in operating in this way the anterior jugular veins would be in danger of being wounded. Tracheotomy may be performed either above or below the isthmus of the thyroid body: or this structure may be divided and the trachea opened beneath it. The isthmus of the thyroid gland usually crosses the second and third rings of the trachea ; along its upper border is frequently to be found a large transverse communicating branch between the superior thyroid veins ; and the isthmus itself is covered by a venous plexus, formed between the thyroid veins of the opposite sides. Theoretically, therefore, it is advisable to avoid dividing this structure in opening the trachea. Above the isthmus the trachea is comparatively superficial, being covered by the skin, superficial fascia, deep fascia, Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, and a second la^^er of the deep fascia, which, attached above to the lower border of the hyoid bone, descends beneath the muscles to the thyroid body, where it divides into two layers and encloses the isthmus. Below the isthmus the trachea lies much more deeply, and is covered by the Sterno- hyoid and the Sterno-thyroid muscles, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, in which is a plexus of veins, some of them of large size; they converge to two trunks, the inferior thyroid veins, which descend on either side of the median line on the front of the trachea, and open into the innominate veins. In the infant the thymus gland ascends a variable distance along the front of the trachea; and opposite the episternal notch the windpipe is crossed by the left innominate vein. Occasionally also in young subjects the innominate artery crosses the tube obliquely above the level of the sternum. The thyroidea ima artery, when that vessel exists, passes from below upwards, along the front of the trachea. From these observations it must be evident that the trachea can be more readily opened above, than below, the isthmus of the thyroid body. Tracheotomy above the isthmus is performed thus : the patient should, if possible, be laid on his back on a table in a good light. A pillow is to be placed under the shoulders and the head thrown back and steadied by an assistant. The surgeon standing on the right side of his patient makes an incision from an inch and a half to two inches in length in the median line of the neck from the top of the cricoid cartilage. The incision must be made exactly in the middle line so as to avoid the anterior jugular veins, and after the superficial structures have been divided, the interval between the Sterno-hyoid muscles must be found, the raphe divided, and the muscles drawn apart. The lower border of the cricoid cartilage must now be felt for, and the upper part of the trachea exposed from this point downwards in the middle line. Bose has recommended that the layer of fascia in front of the trachea should be divided transversely at the level of the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, and, having been seized with a pair of forceps, pressed downwards with the handle of the scalpel. By this means the isthmus of the thyroid gland is depressed and is saved from all danger of being wounded, and the trachea cleanly exposed. The trachea is now transfixed with a sharp hook and drawn forwards in order to steady it, and is then opened by inserting the knife into it and dividing the two or three upper rings from below upwards. If the trachea is to be opened below the isthmus, the incision must be made from a little below the cricoid cartilage to the top of the sternum. In the child the trachea is smaller, more deeply placed, and more movable than in the adult. In fat or short-necked people, or in those in whom the muscles of the neck are prominently developed, the trachea is more deeply placed than in the opposite conditions. A portion of the larynx or the whole of it has been removed for malignant disease. The results which have been obtained from the removal of the whole of it have not been very satisfactory, and the cases in which the operation is justifiable are very few. It may be removed by a median incision through the soft parts; freeing the cartilages from the muscles and other structures in front; separating the larynx from the trachea below, and dissecting off the deeper structure from below upwards. The Pleura Each lung is invested, upon its external surface, by an exceedingly delicate serous membrane, the pleura, which encloses the organ as far as its root, and is then reflected upon the inner surface of the thorax. The portion of the serous membrane investing the surface of the lung is called the pleura imlmonalis (visceral layer of pleura), while that which lines the inner surface of the chest is called the pleura costalis (parietal layer of pleura). The space between these two layers is called the cavity of the pleura, but it must be borne in mind that in the healthy condition the two layers are in contact and there is no real cavity, until the lung becomes collapsed and a separation of it from the wall of the chest takes place. Each pleura is therefore a shut sac, one occupying the right, the other the left half of the thorax ; and they are perfectly separate, not communicating with 3 R 2980 OEGANS OF VOICE AND KESPIKATION each other. The two pleurae do not meet in the middle line of the chest, excepting anteriorly opposite the upper part of the second piece of the sternum; a space being left between them, which contains all the viscera of the thorax excepting the lungs : this is the mediastinum. Reflections of the Pleura (fig. 576).—Commencing at the sternum, the pleura passes outwards, covers the costal cartilages, the inner surface of the ribs and Intercostal muscles, and at the back part of the thorax passes over the thoracic ganglia and their branches, and is reflected upon the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, where it is separated by a narrow interval, the 'posterior mediastinum, from the opposite pleura. From the vertebral column the pleura passes to the side of the pericardium, which it covers to a slight extent: it then covers the back part of the root of the lung, from the lower border of which a triangular fold descends vertically by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the Diaphragm. This fold is the broad ligament of the lung, the ligamentum latum pulmonis, and serves to Fig. 576.—A transverse section of the thorax, showing the relative position of the viscera, and the reflections of the pleurae. Triangularis sterni Internal niammarij vessels retain the lower part of that organ in position. Fro77i the root, the pleura may be traced over the convex surface of the lung, the summit and base, and also over the sides of the fissures between the lobes on to its anterior surface and the front part of its root; from this it is reflected upon the side of the pericardium to the inner surface of the sternum. Below, it covers the upper surface of the Diaphragm and extends, in front, as low as the costal cartilage of the seventh rib ; at the side of the chest, as low as the tenth rib on the left side, and the ninth on the right side ; and behind, it reaches as low as the twelfth rib, and sometimes even beyond it, as low as the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. Above, its apex projects, in the form of a cul-de-sac, through the superior opening of the thorax into the neck, extending from one to two inches above the margin of the first rib, and receives the summit of the corresponding lung ; this sac is strengthened, according to Dr. Sibson, by a dome-like expansion of fascia, attached in front to the posterior border of the first rib, and behind to the anterior border of the transverse process of theTHE MEDIASTINUM 981 seventh cervical vertebra. This is covered and strengthened by a few spreading muscular fibres derived from the Scaleni muscles. A little above the middle of the sternum, the contiguous surfaces of the two pleurje are sometimes in contact for a slight extent; but above and below this point, the interval left between them forms part of the mediastinum. The inner surface of the pleura is smooth, polished, and moistened by a serous fluid ; its outer surface is intimately adherent to the surface of the lung, and to the pulmonary vessels as they emerge from the pericardium ; it is also adherent to the upper surface of the Diaphragm : throughout the rest of its extent it is somewhat thicker, and may be separated from the adjacent parts with extreme facility. The right ]3leural sac is shorter, wider, and reaches higher in the neck than the left. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the j^leura are derived from the inter- costal, the internal mammary, the musculo-phrenic, thymic, pericardiac, and bronchial. The veins correspond to the arteries. The lymjjJiatics are very numerous. The nerves are derived from the phrenic and sympathetic (Luschka). Kolliker states that nerves accompany the ramification of the bronchial arteries in the pleura pulmonalis. Surgical Anatomy.—-In operations upon the kidney, it must be borne in mind that the pleura may sometimes extend below the level of the last rib, and maj^ therefore be opened in these operations, especially when the last rib is removed in order to ^iwe more room. The Mediastinum The Mediastinum is the space left in the median line of the chest by the non- approximation of the two pleurae. It extends from the sternum in front to the spine behind, and contains all the viscera in the thorax excepting the lungs. The mediastinum may be divided for purposes of description into two parts : an upper portion, above the upper level of the pericardium, which is named the Superior mediastinum (Struthers); and a lower portion, below the upper level of the pericardium. This lower portion is again subdivided into three : that part which contains the pericardium and its contents, the middle mediastinum ; that part which is in front of the pericardium, the anterior mediastinum ; and that part which is behind the pericardium, the posterior mediastinum. The superior mediastinum is that portion of the interpleural space which lies above the upper level of the pericardium between the manubrium sterni in front, and the upper dorsal vertebrae behind. It is bounded below by a plane passing back- wards from the junction of the manubrium and gladiolus sterni to the lower part of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra. It contains the origins of the Sterno- hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles and the lower ends of the Longi colli muscles; the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta; the innominate, the thoracic portion of the left carotid and subclavian arteries ; the upper half of the superior vena cava and the innominate veins, and the left superior intercostal vein ; the pneumogastric, cardiac, phrenic, and left recurrent laryngeal nerves ; the trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct; the remains of the thymus gland and lymphatics. The anterior mediastinum is bounded in front by the sternum, on each side by the pleura, and behind by the pericardium. Owing to the oblique position of the heart towards the left side, this space is not parallel with the sternum, but directed obliquely from above downwards and to the left of the median line; it is broad below, narrow above, very narrow opposite the first segment of the gladiolus of the sternum, the contiguous surfaces of the two pleurae being occasionally united over a small space. The anterior mediastinum contains the origins of the Triangularis sterni muscles, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, in which some lymphatic vessels are found ascending from the convex surface of the liver, and two or three lymphatic glands (anterior mediastinal glands). The middle mediastinum is the broadest part of the interpleural space. It contains the heart, enclosed in the pericardium, the ascending aorta, the lowerOEGANS OF VOICE AND EESPIEATION 982 half of the superior vena cava, with the vena azygos major opening into it, the bifurcation of the trachea and the two bronchi, the pulmonary artery dividing into its two branches and the right and left pulmonary veins, the phrenic nerves, and some bronchial lymphatic glands. The posterior mediastinum is an irregular triangular space, running parallel Fig. 577.—The posterior mediastinum. with the vertebral column ; it is bounded in front by the pericardium and roots of the lungs, behind by the vertebral column from the lower border of the fourth dorsal vertebra, and on either side by the pleura. It contains the descend- ing thoracic aorta, the greater and lesser azygos veins, the pneumoga.stric and splanchnic nerves, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, and some lymphatic glands.983 THE LUNGS The Lungs The Lungs are the essential organs of respiration ; they are two in number, placed one on each side of the chest, separated from each other by the heart and other contents of the mediastinum. Each lung is conical in shape, and presents for examination an apex, a base, two borders, and two surfaces (see fig. 579). The apex forms a tapering cone which extends into the root of the neck, about an inch to an inch and a half above the level of the first rib. The base is broad, concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the Dia- phragm ; its circumference is thin, and fits into the space between the lower ribs and the costal attachment of the Diaphragm, extending lower down externally and behind than in front. The external or thoracic surface is smooth, convex, of considerable extent. Fig. 578.—Transverse section through the upper margin of the third dorsal vertebra. (Branne.) LT CAROTID / and corresponds to the form of the cavity of the chest, being deeper behind than in front. The inner surface is concave. It presents, in front, a depression corresponding to the convex surface of the pericardium ; and behind, a deep fissure (the hilum pulmonis), which gives attachment to the root of the lung. The posterior border is rounded and broad, and is received into the deep con- cavity on either side of the spinal column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects, below, between the ribs and the Diaphragm. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the peri- cardium. Each lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and lower, by a long and deep fissure, which extends from the upper part of the posterior border of the organ, about three inches from its apex, downw^ards and forwards to the lower part of its anterior border. This fissure penetrates nearly to the root. In the right lung the upper lobe is partially subdivided by a second and shorter fissure, which extends984 OEGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION from the middle of the preceding, forwards and upwards, to the anterior margin of the organ, marking off a small triangular portion, the middle lobe. The riglit lung is the larger and heavier; it is broader than the left, owing to the inclination of the heart to the left side ; it is also shorter by an inch, in conse- quence of the Diaphragm rising higher on the right side to accommodate the liver. The root of the lungs.—A little above the middle of the inner surface of each lung, and nearer its posterior than its anterior border, is its root, by which the lung is connected to the heart and the trachea. The root is formed by the bronchial tube, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary veins, the bronchial arteries and veins, the pulmonary plexus of nerves, lymphatics, bronchial glands, and areolar tissue, all of which are enclosed by a reflection of the pleura. The root of the right lung lies Fig. 579.—Front view of the heart and lungs. behind the superior vena cava and ascending portion of the aorta, and below the vena azygos major. That of the left lung passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and in front of the descending aorta; the phrenic nerve and the anterior puhnonary plexus lie in front of each, and the pneumogastric and posterior pulmonary plexus behind each. The chief structures composing the root of each lung are arranged in a similar manner from before backwards on both sides, viz. : the pulmonary veins most anterior ; the pulmonary artery in the middle ; and the bronchus, together with the bronchial vessels, behind. From above downwards, on the two sides, their arrangement differs, thus :— On the right side their position is—bronchus, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins ; but on the left side their position is—pulmonary artery, bronchus, pulmonary veins ; this is accounted for by the bronchus being placed on a lower level on the left than on the right side, in order that it may pass under the arch of the aorta.THE LUNGS 985 The lueight of both kings together is about forty-two ounces, the right lung being two ounces heavier than the left; but much variation is met with according to the amount of blood or serous fluid they may contain. The lungs are heavier in the male than in the female, their proportion to the body being, in the former, as I to 37, in the latter as i to 43. The specific gravity of the lung-tissue varies from 0-345 to o'746, water being 1,000. The colour of the lungs at birth is a pinkish-white ; in adult life, a dark slate- colour, mottled in patches ; and as age advances, this mottling assumes a black colour. The colouring matter consists of granules of a carbonaceous substance deposited in the areolar tissue near the surface of the organ. It increases in quantity as age advances, and is more abundant in males than in females. The posterior border of the lung is usually darker than the anterior. The surface of the lung is smooth, shining, and marked out into numerous polyhedral spaces, indicating the lobules of the organ: the area of each of these spaces is crossed by numerous lighter lines. The substance of the lung is of a light, porous, spongy texture ; it floats in water, and crepitates when handled, owing to the presence of air in the tissue; it is also highly elastic ; hence the collapsed state of these organs when they are removed from the closed cavity of the thorax. Structure.—The lungs are composed of an external serous coat, a subserous areolar tissue, and the pulmonary substance or parenchyma. The serous coat is derived from the pleura ; it is thin, transparent, and invests the entire organ as far as the root. The subserous areolar tissue contains a large proportion of elastic fibres; it invests the entire surface of the lung, and extends inwards between the lobules. The ijarenchyma is composed of lobules, which, although closely connected together by an interlobular areolar tissue, are quite distinct from one another, and may be teased asunder without much difficulty in the foetus. The lobules vary in size: those on the surface are large, of pyramidal form, the base turned towards the surface ; those in the interior smaller, and of various forms. Each lobule is composed of one of the ramifications of a bronchial tube and its ter- minal air-cells, and of the ramifications of the pulmonary and bronchial vessels, lymphatics and nerves ; all of these structures being connected together by areolar tissue. The bronchus, upon entering the substance of the lung, divides and subdivides dichotomously throughout the entire organ. Sometimes three branches arise together, and occasionally small lateral branches are given off from the sides of a main trunk. Each of the smaller subdivisions of the bronchi enters a pulmonary lobule, and is termed a lobular bronchial tube. Its wall now begins to present irregular dilatations, at first sparingly and on one side of the tube only, but as it proceeds onwards these dilatations become more numerous and surround the tube on all sides, so that it loses its cylindrical character, and, becoming enlarged, terminates in a sacculated alveolar passage, beset in all directions, both laterally and terminally, by c^cal pouches or air-cells. The enlarged terminations, that is, the alveolar passages from which the caecal pouches or air-cells spring, are termed infundibula. Within the lungs the bronchial tubes are circular, not flattened, and present certain peculiarities of structure. Changes in the structure of the bronchi in the lungs—i. In the lobes of the lujigs.—In the lobes of the lungs the following changes take place. The cartilages are not imperfect rings, but consist of thin laminae, of varied form and size, scattered irregularly along the sides of the tube, being most distinct at the points of division of the bronchi. They may be traced into tubes, the diameter of which is only one-fourth of a line. Beyond this point the tubes are wholly membranous. The fibrous coat and the longitudinal elastic fibres are continued into the smallest ramifications of the bronchi. The muscular coat is disposed in the form of a continuous layer of annular fibres, which may be traced upon the smallest bronchial tubes, and consists of the unstriped variety of muscular tissue. TheORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION 986 mucous membrane lines the bronchi and its ramifications throughout, and is covered with columnar ciliated epithelium. 2. In the lobitles of the lung.—In the lobular bronchial tubes and in the infundibula the following changes take place. The muscular tissue begins to disappear, so that in the infundibula there is scarcely a trace of it. The longitudinal elastic fibres begin to break up, so that in the infundibula they form an interlacement around the mouths of the air-cells which spring from it. The epithelium becomes non-ciliated and flattened. This occurs gradually; thus, in the lobular bronchial tubes, patches of non-ciliated flattened epithelium may be found scattered amongst the columnar ciliated epithelium ; then these patches of non-ciliated flattened epithelium become more and more numerous, until in the infundibula and air-cells all the epithelium is of the non-ciliated pavement variety. In addition to these flattened cells, there are small polygonal granular cells in the air-sacs in flusters of two or three, between the others. The air-cells are small, polyhedral, alveolar recesses composed of a fibrillated connective tissue, and surrounded by a few involuntary muscular and elastic fibres. In their walls are granular, rounded, amoeboid cells, often containing carbonaceous particles. The air-cells are well seen on the surface of the lung, and vary from 2^^jpth to J^th of an inch in diameter; being largest on the surface at the thin borders and at the apex, and smallest in the interior. The pulmonary artery conveys the venous blood to the lungs; it divides into branches which accompany the bronchial tubes, and terminates in a dense capillary network, upon the walls of the intercellular passages and air-cells. In the lung, the branches of the pulmonary artery are usually above and in front of a bronchial tube, the vein below. The pulmonary caijillaries form plexuses which lie immediately beneath the mucous membrane, in the walls and septa of the air-cells, and of the infundibula. In the septa between the air-cells the capillary network forms a single layer. The capillaries form a very minute network, the meshes of which are smaller than the vessels themselves ; * their walls are also exceedingly thin. The vessels of neighbouring lobules are distinct from each other, and do not anastomose; and, according to Dr. Waters,f those of the separate groups of infundibula with their air-cells (which groups he denominates lobulettes), are also independent; so that in the septa between two adjoining lobulettes there would be a double layer of capillaries, one layer belonging to each of the adjacent infundibula with their air- cells. If this is really the arrangement of the vessels, it would follow that, in the septa between the air-cells, the blood in the capillaries would be exposed on all sides to the action of the air, since it is circulating in a single layer of vessels, which is in contact with the membrane of the air-cells on both sides ; but that, in the septa between the neighbouring infundibula, with their air-cells, the blood being in a double layer of capillaries, it will be in contact with the air on one side only. The pulmonary veins commence in the pulmonary capillaries, the radicles coalescing into larger branches, which accompany the arteries and return the oxygenated blood to the left auricle of the heart. The bronchial arteries supply blood for the nutrition of the lung : they are derived from the thoracic aorta, and, accompanying the bronchial tubes, are distributed to the bronchial glands, and upon the walls of the larger bronchial tubes and pulmonary vessels. Those supplying the bronchial tubes form a capillary plexus in the muscular coat, from which branches are given off to form a second plexus in the mucous coat. This plexus communicates with branches of the pulmonary artery, and empties itself into the pulmonary vein. Others are distributed in the interlobular areolar tissue, and terminate partly in the deep, partly in the superficial, bronchial veins. Lastly, some ramify upon the surface of the lung, beneath the pleura, where they form a capillary network. * The meshes are only o'oo2'^' to 0*008'^^ in width, while the vessels are 0-003"^^ to 0*005^'^ KoUiker, Human Microscopic Anatomy. 1 t Med.-Chir. Trans, vol. xxviii. 1845. 1ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION 988 The bronchial vein is formed at the root of the lung, receiving superficial and deep veins corresponding to branches of the bronchial artery. It does not, however, receive all the blood supplied by the artery, as some of it passes into the pulmonary vein. It terminates on the right side in the vena azygos major, and on the left side in the superior intercostal vein. The lymphatics consist of a superficial and deep set: they terminate at the root of the lung, in the bronchial glands. Nerves.—The lungs are supplied from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses, formed chiefly by branches from the sympathetic and pneumogastric. The filaments from these plexuses accompany the bronchial tubes, upon which they are lost. Small ganglia are found upon these nerves. Surface Form.—The apex of the lung is situated in the neck, behind the interval between the two heads of origin of the Sterno-mastoid. The height to which it rises above the clavicle varies very considerably, but is generally about one inch. It may, however, extend as much as an inch and a half or an inch and three-quarters, or, on the other hand, it may scarcely' project above the level of this bone. In order to mark out the anterior margin of the lung, a line is to be drawn from the apex point, one inch above the level of the clavicle, and rather nearer the posterior than the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, downwards and inwards across the sterno-clavicular articulation and first piece of the sternum until it meets, or almost meets, its fellow of the other side opposite the articulation of tlie manubrium and gladiolus. From this point the two lines are to be drawn downwards, one on either side of the mesial line and close to it, as far as the level of the articulation of the fourth costal cartilages to the sternum. From here the two lines diverge, the left is to be drawn at first passing outwards with a slight inclination down- wards, and then taking a bend downwards with a slight inclination outwards to the apex of the heart, and thence to the sixth costo-chondral articulation. The direction of the anterior border of this part of the left lung is denoted with sufficient accuracy by a curved line, with its convexity directed upwards and outwards from the articulation of the fourth right costal cartilage of the sternum to the fifth intercostal space, an inch and a half below, and three-quarters of an inch internal to the left nipple. The continuation of the anterior border of the right lung is marked by a prolongation of its line from the level of the fourth costal cartilages vertically downwards as far as the sixth, when it slopes off along the line of the sixth costal cartilage to its articulation with the rib. The lower border of the lung is marked out by a slightly curved line, with its convexity downwards from the articulation of the sixth costal cartilage to its rib to the spinous process of the tenth dorsal vertebra. If vertical lines are drawn downwards from the nipple, the mid-axillary line and the apex of the scapula, while the arms are raised from the sides, they should intersect this convex line, the first at the sixth, the second at the eighth, and the third at the tenth rib. It will thus be seen that the pleura (see page 980) extends farther down than the lung, so that it may be wounded, and a wound pass through its cavity into the Diaphragm, and even injure the abdominal viscera without the lung being mvolved. The posterior border of the lung is indicated by a line drawn from the level of the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra, down either side of the spine, correspond- ing to the costo-vertebral joints as low as the spinous process of the tenth dorsal vertebra. The trachea bifurcates opposite the spinous process of the fourth dorsal vertebra, and from this point the two bronchi are directed outwards, the right one almost horizontally, the left with a considerable inclination downwards. The position of the great fissure in the right lung may be indicated by a line drawn from the fourth dorsal vertebra round the side of the chest to the anterior margin of the lung opposite the seventh rib, and tlie smaller or secondary fissure by a line drawn from the preceding where it bisects the mid-axillary line to the junction of the fourth costal cartilage to the sternum. The great fissure in the left lung is a little higher, extending from the third dorsal vertebra round the side of the chest to reach the anterior margin of the lung opposite the sixth costal cartilage. Surgical Anatomy.—The lungs may be wounded or torn in three ways, (i) By com- pression of the chest, without any injury to the ribs. (2) By a fractured rib penetrating the lung. (3) By stabs, gunshot wounds, etc. The first form, where the lung is ruptured by external compression without any fracture of the ribs, is very rare, and usually occurs in young children, and affects the root of the lung, i.e. the most fixed part, and thus, implicating the great vessels, is frequently fatal. It would seem a jjriori a most unusual injury, and its exact mode of causation is difficult to interpret. The probable explanation is that immediately before the compression is applied a deep inspiration is taken and the lungs are fully inflated owing then to spasm of the glottis at the moment of compression, the air is unable to escape from the lung, which is not able to recede, and consequently gives way. In the second variety, when the wound in the lung is produced by the penetration of a broken rib, both the pleura costalis and pulmonalis must necessarily be injured, and989 THE THYROID GLAND consequently the air taken into the wounded air-cells may find its way through these wounds into the cellular tissue of the parietes of the chest. This it may do without collecting in the pleural cavity; the two layers of the pleura are so intimately in contact that the air passes straight through from the wounded hmg into the subcutaneous tissue. Emphysema constitutes therefore the most important sign of injury to the lung in cases of fracture of the ribs. Pneumothorax, or air m the pleural cavity, is much more likely to occur in injuries to the lung of the third variety, that is to say, from external wounds, from stabs, gunshot injuries and such like, in which cases air passes either from the wound of the lung or from the external wound into the cavity of the pleura during the respiratory movements. In these cases there is generally no emphysema of the sub- cutaneous tissue unless the external wound is small and valvular, so that the air is drawn into the wound durmg inspiration, and then forced into the cellular tissue around during expiration because it cannot escape from the external wound. Occasionally in wounds of the parietes of the chest no air finds its way into the cavity of the pleura, because the lung at the time of the accident protrudes through the wound and blocks the opening. This occurs where the wound is large, and constitutes one form of hernia of the lung. Another form of hernia of the lung occurs, though very rarely, after wounds of the chest wall, when the wound has healed and the cicatrix subsequently yields from the pressure of the viscus behind. It forms a globular, elastic, crepitating swelling, which enlarges during expiratory efforts, falls in during inspiration, and disappears on holding the breath. The Thyeoid Gland Fig. 581.—Two lobules from the thyroid of an infant. The thyroid gland bears much resemblance in structure to other glandular organs, and was formerly classified together with the thymus, suprarenal capsules, and spleen, under the head of ductless glands, since when fully developed it has no excretory duct. From its situation in connection with the trachea and larynx, the thyroid body is usually described with those organs, although it takes no part in the function of respiration. It is situated at the upper part of the trachea, and consists of two lateral lobes, x^laced one on each side of that tube, and connected together by a narrow transverse portion, the isthmus. Its anterior surface is convex, and covered by the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno- thyroid, and Omo-hyoid muscles. Its lateral surfaces, also convex, lie in contact with the sheath of the common carotid artery. Its posterior surface is concave, and embraces the trachea and larynx. The posterior borders of the gland extend as far back as the lower part of the pharynx, and on the left side to the oesophagus. The thyroid varies in weight from one to tw^o ounces. It females than in males, and becomes slightly increased in size during menstruation. Each lobe is somewhat conical in shape, about two inches in length, and three- quarters of an inch to an inch and a quarter in breadth, the right lobe being the larger of the two. The isthmus connects the lower third of the two lateral lobes ; it measures about half an inch in breadth, and the same in depth, and usually covers the second and third rings of the trachea. Its situation presents, how^ever, many variations, a point of importance in the operation of tracheotomy. Sometimes the isthmus is altogether wanting. A third lobe, of conical shape, called the ijyramid, occasionally arises from the upper part of the isthmus, or from the adjacent portion of either lobe, but most a.

An efferent vessel of considerable size. is larger in990 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION commonly the left, and ascends as high as the hyoid bone. It is occasionally quite detached, or divided into two parts, or altogether wanting. A few muscular bands are occasionally found attached, above, to the body of the hyoid bone, and below to the isthmus of the gland, or its pyramidal process. These form a muscle, which was named by Sommerring the Levator glandulcB thy roi deed. Structure.—The thyroid body is invested by a thin capsule of connective tissue, which projects into its substance and imperfectly divides it into masses of irregular form and size. When the organ is cut into, it is of a brownish-red colour, and is seen to be made up of a number of closed vesicles, containing a yellow glairy fluid, and separated from each other by intermediate connective" tissue. According to Dr. Baber, who has recently published some important observa- tions on the minute structure of the thyroid,* the vesicles of the thyroid of the adult animal are generally closed cavities ; but in some young animals (e.g. young dogs) the vesicles are more or less tubular and branched. This appearance he supposes to be due to the mode of growth of the gland, and merely indicating that Fig. 582.—Minute structure of thyroid. From a transverse section of the thyroid of a dog. (Semi-diagrammatic.) (Baber.) an increase in the number of vesicles is taking place. Each vesicle is lined by a single layer of epithelium, the cells of which, though differing somewhat in shape in different animals, have always a tendency to assume a columnar form. Between the epithelial cells exists a delicate reticulum. The vesicles are of various sizes and shapes, and contain as a normal product a viscid, homogeneous, semi-fluid, slightly yellowish material, which frequently contains blood; the red corpuscles of which are found in it in various stages of disintegration and decolorisation, the yellow tinge being probably due to the haemoglobin, which is thus set free from the coloured corpuscles. Baber has also described in the thyroid gland of the dog large round cells (' parenchymatous cells '), each provided with a single oval-shaped nucleus, which migrate into the interior of the gland-vesicles. The capillary blood-vessels form a dense plexus in the connective tissue around the vesicles, between the epithelium of the vesicles and the endothelium of the lymph-spaces, which latter surround a greater or smaller part of the circumference * 'Researches on the Minute Structure of the Thyroid Gland.' Phil. Trans, part iii. 1881.THE THYMUS GLAND 991 of the vesicle. These lymph-spaces empty themselves into lymphatic vessels, which run in the interlobular connective tissue, not uncommonly surrounding the arteries which they accompany, and communicate with a network in the capsule of the gland. Baber has found in the lymphatics of the thyroid a viscid material which is morphologically identical with the normal constituent of the vesicle. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the thyroid are the superior and inferior thyroid, and sometimes an additional branch (thyroidea media, or ima) from the innominate artery, or the arch of the aorta, which ascends upon the front of the trachea. The arteries are remarkable for their large size and frequent anastomoses. The veins form a plexus on the surface of the gland, and on the front of the trachea, from which arise the superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins; the two former terminating in the internal jugular, the latter in the inno- minate vein. The lymi^hatics are numerous, of large size, and terminate in the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts. The nerves are derived from the middle and inferior cervical gangha of the sympathetic. Surgical Anatomy.—The thyroid gland is subject to enlargement, which is called goitre. This may be due to hypertrophy of any of the constituents of the gland. The simplest (parenchymatous goitre) is due to an enlargement of the follicles. The fibroid is due to increase of the interstitial connective tissue. The cystic is that form in which one or more large cysts are formed from dilatation and possibly coalescence of adjacent folhcles. The imlsating goitre is where the vascular changes predominate over the parenchymatous, and the vessels of the gland are especially enlarged. Finally, there is exojjJithalmic goitre (Graves's disease), where there is great vascularity and often pulsa- tion accompanied by exophthalmos, paljjitation, and rapid pulse. For the relief of these growths various operations have been resorted to : such as injection of tincture of iodine or perchloride of iron, especially applicable to the cystic form of the disease ; ligature of the thyroid arteries ; excision of the isthmus ; and extirpation of the whole or a part of the gland. This latter operation is one of ditiiculty, and when the entire gland has been removed the operation has been followed by a condition resembling myxoedema. In removing the organ great care must be taken to avoid tearing the capsule, as if this happens the gland-tissue bleeds profusel}'. The thyroid arteries should be ligatured before an attempt is made to remove the mass, and in ligatiu-ing the inferior thyroids the position of the recurrent laryngeal nerve must be borne in mind, so as not to include it in the ligature. The Thymus Gland The thymus gland presents much resemblance in structure to other glandular organs, and is another of the organs which used formerly to be denommated ductless glands. The thymus gland is a temporary organ, attaining its full size at the end of the second year, when it ceases to grow, and gradually dwindles, until at puberty it has almost disappeared. If examined when its growth is most active, it will be found to consist of two lateral lobes placed in close contact along the middle line, situated partly in the superior mediastinum, partly in the neck, and extending from the fourth costal cartilage upwards, as high as the lower border of the thyroid gland. It is covered by the sternum, and by the origins of the Sterno- hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. Below, it rests upon the pericardium, being separated from the arch of the aorta and great vessels by a layer of fascia. In the neck it lies on the front and sides of the trachea, behind the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. The two lobes generally differ in size ; they are occasionally united, so as to form a single mass ; and sometimes separated by an intermediate lobe. The thymus is of a pinkish-grey colour, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces. It is about two inches in length, one and a half in breadth below, and about three or four lines in thickness. At birth it weighs about half an ounce. Structure.—Each lateral lobe is composed of numerous lobules, held together by dehcate areolar tissue; the entire gland being enclosed in an investing capsule of a similar but denser structure. The primary lobules vary in size from a pin's992 ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION head to a small pea, and are made up of a number of small nodules or follicles, which are irregular in shape and are more or less fused together, especially towards the interior of the gland. According to Watney, each follicle consists of a medullary and cortical portion, which differ in many essential particulars from each other. The cortical portion is mainly composed of lymphoid cells, supported by a delicate reticulum. In addition to this reticulum, of which traces only are found in the medullary portion, there is also a network of hnely branched cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medullary portion. This network forms an adventitia to the blood-vessels. In the medullary portion there are but few lymphoid cells, but there are, especially towards the centre, granular cells and concentric corpuscles. The granular cells are rounded or flask-shaped masses, attached (often by fibrillated extremities) to blood-vessels and to newly formed connective tissue. The concentric corpuscles are composed of a central mass, consisting of one or more granular cells, and of a capsule, which is formed of epithelioid cells, which are continuous with the branched cells forming the network mentioned above. Each follicle is surrounded by a capillary plexus, from which vessels pass into Fig. 583. I.

In the centre of the medulla there are very few vessels, and they are of minute size. Dr. Watney has recently made the important observation that haemoglobin is found in the thymus, either in cysts or in cells situated near to, or forming part of, the concentric corpuscles. This haemoglobin varies from granules to masses exactly resembhng coloured blood-corpuscles, oval in the bird, reptile, and flsh ; circular in all mammals, except in the camel. Dr. Watney has also discovered, in the lymph issuing from the thymus, similar cells to those found in the gland, and, hke them, containing haemoglobin, either in the form of granules or masses. From these facts he arrives at the physiological conclusion that the thymus is one source of the coloured blood-corpuscles. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the thymus are derived from the internal mammary, and from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins terminate in the left innominate vein, and in the thyroid veins. The lymphatics are of large size, arise in the substance of the gland, and are said to terminate inTHE THYMUS GLAND 993 the internal jugular vein.

They are placed in the loins, one on each side of the vertebral column, behind the peritoneum, and surrounded by a mass of fat and loose areolar tissue. Their upper extremity is on a level with the upper border of the twelfth dorsal vertebra, their lower extremity on a level with the third lumbar. The right kidney is usually on a slightly lower level than the left, probably on account of the vicinity of ihe liver. The kidneys rest on the lower part of the Diaphragm and the fascia covering the Quadratus lumborum and the Psoas magnus muscles. The right one is covered in front by the right lobe of the liver, the descending portion of the duodenum, and the ascending colon; the left one has in front the fundus of the stomach, the tail of the pancreas, and the descending colon. Each kidney is about four inches in length, two to two and a half in breadth, and rather more than one inch in thickness. The left is somewhat longer, though narrower, than the right. The weight of the kidney in the adult male varies from 4^ ounces to 6 ounces, in the adult female from 4 ounces to ounces. The com- bined weight of the two kidneys in proportion to the body is about i in 240. The kidney has a characteristic form. It is flattened on its sides, and presents at one part of its circumference a hollow. It is larger at its upper than its lower extremity. It presents for examination two surfaces, two borders, and an upper and lower extremity. Its anterior surface is convex, looks forwards and outwards, and is partially covered by peritoneum. The upper part of this surface on the right side is in contact with the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, on which it produces a slight concave impression, the impressio renalis (page 934) ; below this, the descending portion of the duodenum, and the upper part of the ascending colon are connected to this surface by a quantity of loose areolar tissue. On the left side the upper part of the anterior surface of the kidney is in contact with the under surface of the stomach, and below this with the left extremity of the pancreas, whilst the lower part is connected to the descending colon by loose areolar tissue. The posterior surface is flatter than the anterior, and is embedded in areolar tissue, which separates it from the Diaphragm covering the twelfth rib, and from the anterior lamellae of the lumbar fascia covering the Quadratus lumborum muscle, and internally from the fascia covering the Psoas magnus muscle. The external border is convex, and is directed outwards and backwards, towards the posterolateral wall of the abdomen. On the left side it is in contact, at its upper part, with the spleen. The internal border is concave, and is directed forwards and a little downwards. It presents a deep longitudinal fissure, bounded by a prominent overhanging ante- rior and posterior lip. This fissure is named the hihmi, and allows of the passage of the vessels, nerves, and ureter into and out of the kidney.995 THE KIDNEYS Fig Vertical section of kidney. The superior extremity, directed slightly inwards as well as upwards, is thick and rounded, and is surmounted by the suprarenal capsule, which covers also a small portion of the anterior surface. The inferior extremity, directed a little outwards as well as downwards, is smaller and thinner than the superior. It extends to within two inches of the crest of the ilium. At the hilum of the kidney the relative position of the main structures passing into and out of the kidney is as follows:—the vein is in front, the artery in the middle, and the duct or ureter behind and towards the lower part. By a knowledge of these relations, the student may distinguish between the right and left kidney. The kidney is to be laid on the table before the student, on its posterior surface, with its lower extremity towards the observer—that is to say, with the ureter behind and below the other vessels ; the hilum will then be directed to the side to which the kidney belongs. General Structure of the Kidney.—The kidney is surrounded by a distinct investment of fibrous* tissue, which forms a firm, smooth covering to the organ. It closely invests it, but 'can be easily stripped off, in doing which, however, numerous fine processes of connective tissue and small blood-vessels are torn through. Beneath this coat, a thin wide-meshed network of unstriped muscular fibre forms an incomplete covering to the organ. When the fibrous coat is stripped off, the surface of the kidney is found to be smooth and even, and of a deep red colour. In infants, fissures extending for some depth may be seen on the surface of the organ, a remnant of the lobular construction of the gland. The kidney is dense in texture, but is easily lacerable by me- chanical force. In order to obtain a know- ledge of the structure of the gland, a vertical section must be made from its convex to its concave border, and the loose tissue and fat removed from around the vessels and the excretory duct (fig. 585). It will be then seen that the kidney consists of a central cavity, surrounded at all parts, but one, by the proper kidney-substance. This central cavity is called the sinus, and is lined by a prolongation of the fibrous coat of the kidney, which enters through a longitudinal fissure, the hilum (before mentioned), which is situated at that part of the cavity which is not surrounded by kidney-structure. Through this fissure the blood-vessels of the kidney and its excretory duct pass, and therefore these structures, upon entering the kidney, are contained within the sinus. The excretory duct, or ureter, after entering, dilates into a wide, funnel-shaped sac, named the pelvis. This divides into two or three tubular divisions, which subdivide into several short, truncated branches, named calices or infiindibiila, all of which are contained in the central cavity of the kidney. The blood- vessels of the kidney, after passing through the hilum, are contained in the sinus or central cavity, lying between its lining membrane and the excretory apparatus, before entering the kidney-substance. This central cavity, as before mentioned, is surrounded on all sides, except at the hilum, by the substance of the kidney, which is at once seen to consist of two parts, viz. of an external, granular, investing part, which is called the cortical 3 s 2996 THE URINAEY ORGANS Fig. 586. portion ; and of an internal part, the medullary portion, made up of a number of dark-coloured pyramidal masses, with their bases resting on the cortical part, and their apices converging towards the centre, where they form prominent papillag, which project into the interior of the calices. The cortical substance is of a bright reddish-brown colour, soft, granular, and easily lacerable. It is found everywhere immediately beneath the capsule, and is seen to extend in an arched form over the base of each medullary pyramid. The part separating the sides of any two pyramids through which the arteries and nerves enter, and the veins and lymphatics emerge from the kidney, is called a cortical column or column of Bertini (a a', fig. 585) ; whilst that portion which stretches from one cortical column to the next, and intervenes between the base of the pyramid and the capsule (which is marked by the dotted line, extending from A to a' in fig. 585), is called a cortical arch, the depth of which varies from a third to half an inch. The medullary substance, as before said, is seen to consist of pale red-coloured, striated, conical masses, the pyramids of Malpighi ; the num'ber af which, varying from eight to eighteen, correspond to the number of lobes of which the organ in the foetal state is composed. The base of each pyramid is surrounded by a cortical arch and directed towards the circumference of the kidney ; the sides are contigu- ous with the cortical columns ; whilst the apex, known as the papilla or mammilla of the kidney, projects into one of the calices of the ureter. v-N-OvO^ ~ I I ^ These two parts, cortical and medullary, so "^"'"'^ dissimilar in appearance, are very similar in structure, being made up of urinary tubes and blood-vessels, united and bound together by a connecting matrix or stroma. Minute Anatomy.—The tubuli urinijeri, of which the kidney is for the most part made up, commence in the cortical portion of the kidney, and, after pursuing a very circuitous course through the cortical and medullary parts of the kidney, finally terminate at the apices of the Malpighian pyramids by open mouths (fig. 586), so that the fluid which they contain is emptied into the dilated extremity of the ureter con- tained in the sinus of the kidney. If the surface of one of the papillae is examined with a lens, it will be seen to be studded over with a number of small depressions from sixteen to twenty in number, and in a fresh kidney, upon pressure being made, fluid will be seen to exude from these depressions. They are the orifices of the tubuli uriniferi, which terminate in this situa- tion. They commence in the cortical portion of the kidney as the Maipigiiian bodies, which are small rounded masses, varying in size, but of an average of about of an inch in dia- meter. They are of a deep red colour, and are found only in the cortical portion of the kidney. Each of these little bodies is composed of two parts : a central glomerulus of vessels, called a Malpighian tuft; and a membranous emelo^Q, Malpighian capsule, or capsule of Boumian, which latter is a small pouch-like commencement of a uriniferous tubule. The Malpighian tuft, or vascular glomerulus, is a network of convoluted capillary blood-vessels, held together by scanty connective tissue and grouped into B. Margin of me- Loops of Henle. A A.

This capillary network is derived from a small arterial twig, the afferent vessel, which pierces the wall of the capsule, generally at a point opposite that at which the latter is connected with the tube ; and the resulting vein, the efferent vessel, emerges from the capsule at the same point. The afferent vessel is usually the larger of the two (fig. 587). The Malpighian, or Boicman's capsule, which surrounds the glomerulus, is formed of a hyaline membrane, supported by a small amount of connective tissue, which is continuous with the connective tissue of the tube. It is lined on its inner surface by a layer of squamous epithelial cells, which are reflected from the lining membrane on to the glomerulus, at the point of entrance or exit of the afferent and efferent vessels. The whole surface of the glomerulus is covered with a continuous layer of the same cells, on a delicate supporting membrane, which Avith the cells dips in between the lobules of the glomerulus, closely surrounding them (fig. 588). Thus between the glomerulus and the capsule a space is left, forming a cavity lined by a continuous layer of cells, which varies in size according to the state of secretion and the amount of fluid present in it. The cells, as above stated, are squamous in the adult, but in the foetus and young subject they are polyhedral or even columnar. The tuhuli iiriniferi, commencing in the Malpighian bodies, in their course Fig. 587.—Minute structure Fig. 588.—Malpighian of kidney. body. present many changes in shape and direction, and are contained partly in the medullary and partly in the cortical portions of the organ. At their junction with the Malpighian capsule they present a somewhat constricted portion, which is termed the nech. Beyond this the tube becomes convoluted, and pursues a considerable course in the cortical structure, constituting the proximal convoluted tithe. After a time the convolutions disappear, and the tube approaches the medullary portion of the kidney in a more or less spiral manner. This section of the tube has been called the spiral tube of Schacliowa. Throughout this portion of their course the tubuli uriniferi have been contained entirely in the cortical structure, and have presented a pretty uniform calibre. They now enter the medullary portion ; suddenly become much smaller, quite straight in direction, and dip down for a variable depth into the pyramids, constituting the descending limb of Henle's loop. Bending on themselves, they form a kind of loop, the loop of Henle, and reascending, they become suddenly enlarged and again spiral in direction, forming the ascending limb of Henle's loop, and re-enter the cortical structure. This portion of the tube does not present a uniform calibre, but becomes narrower as it ascends, and irregular in outline. As a narrow tube it enters the cortex and ascends for a short distance, when it again becomes dilated, irregular, and angular. This section is termed the irregular tubule ; it terminates in a convoluted tube, which exactly resembles the proximal convoluted tubule, and isTHE URINARY ORGANS 998 called the distal convoluted tubule. This again terminates in a narrow curved tube, which enters the straight or collecting tube. Each straight, otherwise called a collecting or receiving tube, commences by a small orifice on the summit of one of the papillae, thus opening and discharging its contents into the interior of one of the calices. Traced into the substance of the pyramid, these tubes are found to run from apex to base, dividing dichotomously in their course and slightly diverging from each' other. Thus dividing and subdividing, they reach the base of the pyramid, and enter the cortical structure greatly increased in number. Upon entering the cortical portion they continue a straight course for a variable distance, and are arranged in groups, called medullary rays, several of these groups corresponding to a single pyramid. The tubes in the centre of the group are the longest, and reach almost to the surface of the kidney. while the external ones are shorter, and advance only a short distance into the cortex. In consequence of this arrangement the cortical portion presents a number of conical masses, the apices of Avhich reach the periphery of the organ, and the bases are applied to the medullary portion. These.are termed the pyramids of Ferrein. As they run through the cortical portion, the straight tubes receive on either side the curved extremity of the convoluted tubes, which, as stated above, commence at the Malpighian bodies. It will be seen from the above description that there is a continuous series of tubes from their commencement in the Malpighian bodies, to their termination at the orifices on the apices of the pyramids of Malpighi ; and that the urine, the secretion of which commences in the capsule, finds its way through these tubes into the calices of the kidney, and so into the ureter. Commencing at the capsule, the tube first presents a narrow constricted portion (i) the nech. 2. It forms a wide convoluted tube, the iwoximal convoluted tttbe, 3.

The Tubuli Uriniferi: their Structure.—The tubuli uriniferi consist of base- ment membrane lined with epithelium. The epithelium varies considerably in different sections of the uriniferous tabes. In the neck the epithelium is con- tinuous with that lining the Malpighian capsule, and like it consists of flattened cells with an oval nucleus (fig. 589, a). The cells are, however, very indistinct and difficult to trace, and the tube has here the appearance of a simple basement membrane unlined by epithelium. In the proximal convoluted tubule and the spiral tubule of Schachowa the epithelium is polyhedral in shape, the sides of the cells not being straight, but fitting into each other, and in some animals so fused Fig. 590.*—Longitudinal section of Fig. 591.—Longitudinal section of Henle's descending Innb. straight tube. a.

In the human kidney the cells often present an angular projection of the surface next the base- ment membrane. These cells are made up of more or less rod-like fibres, which rest by one extremity on the basement membrane, whilst the other projects towards the lumen of the tube. This gives to the cells the appearance of distinct striation (Heidenhain) (fig. 589, b). In the descending limb of Henle's loop the epithelium resembles that found in the Malpighian capsule and the commencement of the tube, consisting of flat transparent epithelial plates, with an oval nucleus (figs. 589, a ; 590). In the ascending limb, on the other hand, the cells partake more of the character of those described as existing in the proximal convoluted tubule, being polyhedral in shape, and presenting the same appearance of striation. The nucleus, however, is not situated in the centre of the cell, but near the lumen (iig. 589, c). After the ascending limb of Henle's loop becomes narrower upon entering the cortical structure, the striation appears to be confined to the outer part of the cell; at all events it is much more distinct in this situation; the nucleus, which appears flattened and angular, being still situated near the lumen (fig. 589, d). In the irregular tubule, the cells undergo a still further change, becoming very angular, From the HandhooTi for the Physiological Laboratory.THE URINARY ORGANS lOOO and presenting thick bright rods or markings, which render the striation much more distinct than in any other section of the urinary tubules (fig. 589, h). In the distal convoluted tubule the epithelium appears to be identical with that which has been described as existing in the proximal convoluted tubule (fig. 589, b).

The Renal Blood-vessels.—The kidney is plentifully supplied with blood by the renal artery, a large offset of the abdominal aorta. Previously to entering the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches, which are distributed to its substance. At the hilum these branches lie between the renal vein and ureter, the vein being usually in front, the ureter behind. Each vessel gives off some small branches to the suprarenal capsules, the ureter, and the sur- rounding cellular tissue and muscles. Frequently there is a second renal artery, which is given off from the abdominal aorta at a lower level, and supplies the lower portion of the kidney. It is termed the inferior renal artery. The branches of the renal artery, whilst in the sinus, give off a few twigs for the nutrition of the surrounding tissues, and terminate in the arteries propricB renales, which enter the kidney proper in the columns of Bertini. Two of these pass to each pyramid of Malpighi, and run along its sides for its entire length, giving off as they advance the afferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies in the columns. Having arrived at the bases of the pyramids, they make a bend in their course, so as to lie between the bases of the pyramids and the cortical arches, where they break up into two distinct sets of branches devoted to the supply of the remaining portions of the kidney. The first set, the interlobular arteries (figs. 593, 594, b), are given off at right angles from the side of the arteriae propriae renales looking towards the cortical sub- stance, and passing directly outwards between the pyramids of Ferrein they reach the cap- sule, where they terminate in the capillary network of this part. In their outward course they give off lateral branches ; these are the afferent vessels for the Malpighian bodies (see page 997), and, having pierced the capsule, end in the Malpighian tufts. From each tuft the corresponding renal efferent arises, and, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent vessel entered, anastomoses with other efferents from other tufts, and con- tributes to form a dense venous plexus around the adjacent urinary tubes (fig. 595). The second set of branches from the arterige propriae renales are for the supply of the medullary pyramids, which they enter at their bases; and, passing straight through their substance to their apices, terminate in the venous plexuses found in that situation. They are called the arteriolce recta (figs. 593, 594, f). The Renal Veins arise from three sources—the veins beneath the capsule, the plexuses around the tubuli contort! in the cortical arches, and the plexuses situated at the apices of the pyramids of Malpighi. The veins beneath the capsule are f stellate in arrangement, and are derived from the capillary network of the capsule, into which the terminal branches of the interlobular arteries break up. These join to form the vence interlobulares, which pass inwards bettueen the pyramids of Ferrein, receive branches from the plexuses around the tubuli contorti, and, having arrived at the bases of the Malpighian pyramids, join with the venae rectae, next to be described (figs. 593, 594, b). The Vence Bectce are branches from the plexuses at the apices of the medullary pyramids, formed by the terminations of the arteriole rectas. They pass outwards in a straight course between the tubes of the medullary structure, and joining, as above stated, the venas interlobulares, form the proper renal veins (figs. 593, 594?/)• These vessels, Vence VropricB Renales, accompany the arteries of the same name, .

In this cavity they inosculate with the corresponding veins from the outer pyramids to form the renal vein, which emerges from the kidney at the hilum and opens into the inferior vena cava ; the left being longer than the right, from having to cross in front of the abdominal aorta. Nerves of the Kidney.—The nerves of the kidney, although small, are about fifteen in number. They have small ganglia developed upon them, and are derived from the renal plexus, which is formed by branches from tjie solar plexus, the lower and outer part of the semilunar ganglion and aortic plexus, and from the lesser and smallest splanchnic nerves. They communicate with the spermatic plexus, a circumstance which may explain the occurrence of pain in the testicle in affections of the kidney. So far as they have been traced, they seem to accompany the renal artery and its branches, but their exact mode of termination is not known. The lympliatics consist of a superficial and deep set which terminate in the lumbar glands. Connective tissiie, or intertuhular stroma.—-Although the tubules and vessels are closely packed, a certain small amount of connective tissue, continuous with the capsule, binds them firmly together. This tissue was first described by Goodsir, and subsequently by Bowman. Ludwig and Zawarykin have observed distinct fibres passing around the Malpighian bodies ; and Henle has seen them between the straight tubes composing the medullary structure. Surface Form.—The kidneys, being situated at the back part of the abdominal cavity and deeply placed, cannot be felt unless enlarged or misplaced. They are situated on the confines of the epigastric and umbilical regions internally, with the hj'pochondriac and Imnbar regions externally. The left is somewhat higher than the right. According to Morris, the position of the kidney ma.}^ be thus defined: Anteriorly. ' i. A horizontal line through the umbilicus is below the lower edge of each kidne}-. 2. A vertical line carried upwards to the costal arch from the middle of Poupart's ligament has one third of the kidney to its outer side, and two thirds to its inner side, i.e. between this line and the median line of the bod3\' In adopting these lines it must be borne in mind that the axes of the kidneys are not vertical, but oblique, and if continued upwards would meet about the ninth dorsal vertebra. Posteriorly. The upper end of the left kidney would be defined by a line drawn horizontally outwards from the spinous process of the eleventh dorsal vertebra, and its lower end by a point two inches above the iliac crest. The right kidney would be half to three-quarters of an inch lower. Morris lays down the following rules for indicating the position of the kidney on the posterior surface of the body: ' i. A line parallel with, and one inch from, the spine between the lower edge of the tip of the spinous process of the eleventh dorsal vertebra, and the lower edge of the spinous process of the third lumbar vertebra. 2. A line from the top of this first hue outwards at right angles to it for 2| inches. 3. A line from the lower end of the first transversel}' outwards for 2f inches. 4. A line parallel to the first, and connecting the outer extremities of the second and third lines just described.' The hilum of the kidney lies about two inches fi^om the middle line of the back at the level of the spinous process of the first lumbar vertebra. Surgical Anatomy.—The kidney is embedded in a large qitantit}^ of loose fatty tissue, and is but slightly covered bj^ peritoneam ; hence rupture of this organ is not nearly so serious an accident as rupture of the liver or spleen, since the extravasation of blood and urine which follows is outside the peritoneal cavity. Occasionally the kidney may be bruised'by blows in the loin, or by being compressed between the lower ribs and the ilium when the body is violently bent forwards. This is followed by a little transient hsematuria, which, however, speedily passes off. Occasionally, when rupture involves the pelvis of the kidney or the commencement of the ureter, this duct may become blocked, and hydro-nephrosis follow. The loose cellular tissue around the kidney may be the seat of suppuration, constituting perinejjhritic abscess. This may be due to injur}', to disease of the kidney itself, or to extension of inflammation from neighbouring parts. It may burst into the pleura, constituting empyema; into the colon or bladder; or may point externally in the groin or loin. Tumours of the kidney, of which perhaps sarcoma, in children, is the most common, may be recognised by their position and fixity ; by the resonant colon lying in, front of it; by their not moving with respiration ; and by their rounded outline not presenting a notched anterior margin like the spleen, with which they are most likely to1003 THE URETERS be confounded. The examination of the kidney should be bimanual; that is to say, one hand should be placed in the flank and firm pressure made forwards, while the other hand is buried in the abdominal wall, just external to the semilunar line. Manipulation of the kidney frequently produces a peculiar sickening sensation, with sometimes faintness. The kidney is mainly held in position by the mass of fatty matter in which it is embedded and over which the peritoneum is stretched. If this fatty matter is loose or lax or is absorbed, the kidney may become movable and may give rise to great pain. This condition occurs, therefore, in badly nourished people, or in those who have become emaciated from any cause, and is more common in women than in men. It must not be confounded with ihe fioating kidney : this is a congenital condition due to the develop- ment of a meso-nephron, which permits the organ to move more or less freely. The two conditions cannot, however, be distinguished until the abdomen is opened or the kidney explored from the loin. The kidney has, of late years, been frequently the seat of surgical interference. It may be exposed for exploration or the evacuation of pus (nephrotomy) ; it may be incised for the removal of stone (nephro-lithotomy) ; it may be sutured when movable or floating (nephroraphy) ; or it may be removed (nephrectomy). The kidney may be exposed either by a lumbar or abdominal incision. The lumbar operation is the one which is generally adopted, unless in cases of very large tumours, or of wandering kidneys, with a loose meso-nephron, on account of the advantages which it possesses of not opening the peritoneum, and affording admirable drainage. It may be performed either by an oblique, a vertical, or a transverse incision. Perhaps the preferable, as affording the best means for exploring the whole surface of the kidney, is an incision from the tip of the last rib, backwards to the edge of the Erector spinae. This incision must not be quite parallel to the rib, but its posterior end must be at least three- quarters of an inch below it, lest the pleura be wounded. This cut is quite sufficient for an exploration of the organ. Should it require removal, a vertical incision can be made downwards to the crest of the ilium, along the outer border of the Quadratus lumborum. The structures divided are, the skin, the superficial fascia with the cutaneous nerves, the deep fascia, the posterior border of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen, and the outer border of the Latissimus dorsi; the Internal oblique and the posterior aponeurosis of the Transversalis muscle ; the outer border of the Quadratus lumborum, and the deep layer of the transversalis aponeurosis, and the transversalis fascia. The fatty tissue around the kidney is now exposed to view and must be separated by the fingers, or a director, in order to reach the kidney. The abdominal operation is best performed by an incision in the linea semilunaris on the side of the kidney to be removed, as recommended by Langenbuch. The incision is made of varying length according to the size of the kidney; its mid-point should be on a level with the umbilicus. The abdominal cavity is opened. The intestines are then held aside, and the outer layer of the meso-colon opened, so that the fingers can be introduced behind the peritoneum and the renal vessels sought for. These are then to be ligatured: if tied separately, care must be taken to ligature the artery first. The kidney must now be enucleated, and the vessels and ureter divided, and the latter tied, or if thought necessary stitched to the edge of the wound. The Ueeters The Ureters are the two tubes which conduct the urine from the kidneys into the bladder. They commence within the sinus of the kidney, by a number of short truncated branches, the calices or infundihula, which unite, either directly or indirectly, to form a dilated pouch, the ^pelvis, from which the ureter, after passing through the hilum of the kidney, descends to the bladder. The calices are cup-like tubes encircling the apices of the Malpighian pyramids ; but inasmuch as one calyx may include two or even more papillae, their number is generally less than the pyramids themselves, the former being from seven to thirteen, whilst the latter vary from eight to eighteen. These calices converge into two or three tubular divisions, which by their junction form the pelvis, or dilated portion of the ureter. The portion last mentioned, where the pelvis merges into the ureter proper, is found opposite the spinous process of the first lumbar vertebra, in which situation it is accessible behind the peritoneum (see fig. 543, page 924). The ureter proper is a cylindrical, membranous tube, about sixteen inches in length, and of the diameter of a goose-quill, extending from the pelvis of the kidney to the bladder. Its course is obliquely downwards and inwards through the lumbar region into the cavity of the pelvis, where it passes downwards, forwards, and inwards across that cavity to the base of the bladder, into which itI004 THE URINARY ORGANS then opens by a constricted orifice, after having passed obhqnely for nearly an inch between its muscular and mucous coats. Relations.—In its course it rests upon the Psoas muscle, being covered by the peritoneum, and crossed obliquely, from within outwards, by the spermatic vessels; the right ureter lying close to the outer side of the inferior vena cava. Opposite the first piece of the sacrum it crosses either the common or external iliac artery, lying behind the ileum on the right side and the sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left. In the pelvis it enters the posterior false ligament of the bladder, below the obliterated hypogastric artery, the vas deferens in the male passing between it and the bladder. In the female the ureter passes along the sides and cervix of the uterus and upper part of the vagina. At the base of the bladder it is situated about two inches from its fellow; lying, in the male, about an inch and a half behind the base of the prostate, at the posterior angle of the trigone. Structure.—The ureter is composed of three coats—a fibrous, muscular, and mucous. The fibrous coat is the same throughout the entire length of the duct, being continuous at one end with the capsule of the kidney at the floor of the sinus; whilst at the other it is lost in the fibrous structure of the bladder. In the pelvis of the kidney the muscular coat consists of two layers, longitudinal and circular; the longitudinal fibres become lost upon the sides of the papill^e at the extremities of the calices ; the circular fibres may be traced surrounding the medullary structure in the same situation. In the ureter proper the muscular fibres are very distinct, and are arranged in three layers—an external longitudinal, a middle circular, and an internal layer, less distinct than the other two, but having a general longitudinal direction. According to Kolliker, this internal layer is only found in the neighbourhood of the bladder. The mucous coat is smooth, and presents a few longitudinal folds which become effaced by distension. It is continuous with the mucous membrane of the bladder below, whilst it is prolonged over the papillae of the kidney above. Its epithelium is of a peculiar character, and resembles that found in the bladder. It is known by the name of ' transitional' epithelium. It consists of several layers of cells, of which the innermost—that is to say, the cells in contact with the urine—are quadrilateral in shape, with a concave margin on their outer surface, into which fits the rounded end of the cells of the second layer. These, the inter- mediate cells, more or less resemble columnar epithelium, and are pear-shaped, with a rounded internal extremity which fits into the concavity of the cells of the first layer, and a narrow external extremity which is wedged in between the cells of the third layer. The external or third layer consists of conical or oval cells varying in number in different parts, and presenting processes which extend down into the basement membrane. The arteries supplying the ureter are branches from the renal, spermatic, internal iliac, and inferior vesical. The nerves are derived from the inferior mesenteric, spermatic, and pelvic plexuses. Suprarenal Capsules The Suprarenal Capsules were formerly classified together with the spleen, thymus, and thyroid, under the head of '■ ductless glands,' as they have no excretory duct. They are two small flattened glandular bodies, of a yellowish colour, situated at the back part of the abdomen, behind the peritoneum, and immediately in front of the upper part of each kidney ; hence their name. The right one is somewhat triangular in shape, bearing a resemblance to a cocked hat; the left is more semilunar, and usually larger and higher than the right. They vary in size in different individuals, being sometimes so small as to be scarcely detected : their usual size is from an inch and a quarter to,nearly two inches in length, rather lessSUPKARENAL CAPSULES :oo5 in width, and from two to three hnes in thickness. Their average weight is about a drachm each. Relations.—The relations of the suprarenal capsules differ on the two sides of the body. The right suprarenal presents on its anterior surface two areas ; along its upper and inner borders a depressed area, which is in contact in front with the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, and along its inner border with the inferior vena cava (Rolleston), and behind rests on the crus of the Diaphragm ; over the remainder of the anterior surface is an elevated area, which is covered in front by peritoneum, passing from the upper part of the kidney to the under Fig. 597. surface of the liver, and behind rests on the upper and inner part of the kidney. The left suprarenal is in contact by its an- terior surface, superiorly, with the spleen ; below and internal to this, it is in contact Fig. 596.--Vertical section of the suprarenal capsule. (From Elberth, in Strieker's Manual.') ^h^-^m^ Zona pW% (jlomerulosa jccsciculata Zona reticitlaris Medulla Fig. 598. Frameiuorh Nuclei :ziZZ Capillary with the peritoneum forming the lesser sac, which separates it from the cardiac extremity of the stomach ; and at its lower part it is covered by the pancreas and splenic artery, and is therefore not in contact with the peritoneum. By its posterior surface, at its outer and back part it rests upon the kidney; whilst below and internally it is in contact with the left crus of the Diaphragm. The surface of the suprarenal gland is surrounded by areolar tissue containing much fat, and closely invested by a thin fibrous coat, which is difficult to remove, on account of the numerous fibrous processes and vessels which enter the organ through the furrows on its anterior surface and base. Small accessory suprarenals are often to be found in the connective tissueTHE URINARY ORGANS ioo6 around the snprarenals. The smaller of these, on section, show a uniform surface, but in some of the larger a distinct medulla can be made out. Structure.—On making a perpendicular section, the gland is seen to consist of two substances—external or cortical, and internal or medullary. The former, w^hich constitutes the chief part of the organ, is of a deep yellow colour. The medullary substance is soft, pulpy, and of a dark brown or black colour, whence the name atrahiliary cajjstiles formerly given to these organs. In the centre is often seen a space, not natural, but formed by the breaking down after death of the medullary substance. The cortical portion consists chiefly of narroW' columnar masses, placed perpen- dicularly to the surface. This arrangement is due to the disposition of the capsule, which sends into the interior of the gland processes, passing in vertically and communicating viiih each other by transverse bands, so as to form spaces which open into each other. These spaces are of slight depth near the surface of the organ, so that there the section somewhat resembles a net; this is termed the zona glomerulosa ; but they become much deeper or longer further in, so as to resemble pipes or tubes placed endwise, the zona fascicidata. Still deeper down, near the medullary part, the spaces become again of small extent ; this is named the zojia reticularis. These processes, or trabeculse, derived from the capsule and forming the framework of the spaces, are composed of fibrous connective tissue, with longitudinal bundles of unstriped muscular fibres. Within the interior of the spaces are contained groups of polyhedral cells, which are finely granular in appearance, and contain a spherical nucleus, and not unfrequently fat molecules. These groups of cells do not entirely fill the spaces in which they are contained, but between them and the trabecule of the framework is a channel, which is believed to be a lymph path or sinus, and which communicates wdth certain passages between the cells composing the group. The lymph path is supposed to open into a plexus of efferent lymphatic vessels which are contained in the capsule. In the medullary portion, the fibrous stroma seems to be collected together into a much closer arrangement, and forms bundles of connective tissue which are loosely applied to the large plexus of veins of which this part of the organ mainly consists. In the insterstices lie a number of cells compared by Frey to those of columnar epithehum. They are coarsely granitlar, do not contain any fat molecules, and some of them are branched. Luschka has affirmed that these branches are connected with the nerve-fibres of a very intricate plexus which is foimd in the medulla: this statement has not been verified by other observers, for the tissue of the meduUary substance is less easy to make out than that of the cortical, owing to its rapid decomposition. The numerous arteries w^hich enter the suprarenal bodies, from the sources mentioned below% penetrate the cortical part of the gland, where they break up into capillaries in the fibrous septa, and these converge to the very numerous veins of the medullary portion, which are collected together into the suprarenal vein, which usually emerges as a single vessel from the centre of the gland. The arteries supplying the suprarenal capsules are numerous and of large size ; they are derived from the aorta, the phrenic, and the renal; they subdivide into numerous minute branches previous to entering the substance of the gland. The suprarenal vein returns the blood from the meduUary venous plexus, and receives several branches from the cortical substance ; it opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, on the left side into the renal vein. The lymphatics terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are exceedingly numerous : they are found chiefly, if not entirely, in the medulla, and are derived from the solar and renal plexuses, and, according to Bergmann, from the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves. They have numerous smaU ganglia developed upon them, from which circumstance the organ has been conjectured to have some function in connection with the sympathetic nervous system.THE BLADDER 1007 THE PELVIS The cavity of the pelvis is that part of the general abdominal cavity which is below the level of the linea ilio-pectinea and the promontory of the sacrum. Boundaries.—It is bounded, behind, by the sacrum, the coccyx, the Pyriformis muscle, and the great sacro-sciatic ligaments ; in front and at the sides, by the ossa pubis and ischia, covered by the Obturator muscles ; above, it communicates with the cavity of the abdomen ; and below, the outlet is closed by the triangular ligament, the Levatores ani and Coccygei muscles, and the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which is reflected from the wall of the pelvis on to the viscera. Contents.—The viscera contained in this cavity are the urinary bladder, the rectum, and some of the generative organs peculiar to each sex, and some convo- lutions of the small intestines : they are partially covered by the peritoneum, and supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The Bladdek The bladder is the reservoir for the urine. It is a musculo-membranous sac, situated in the pelvis, behind the pubes, and in front of the rectum in the male, Fig. 599.—Vertical section of bladder, penis, and urethra. the uterus and vagina intervening between it and that intestine in the female. The shape, position, and relations of the bladder are greatly influenced by age, sex, and the degree of distension of the organ. During infancy it is conical in shape, and projects above the upper border of the os pubis into the hypogastric region. In the adult, when quite empty and contracted, it is a small triangular sac, placed deeply in the pelvis, flattened from before backwards, its apex reachingTHE URINARY ORGANS ioo8 as high as the upper border of the symphysis pubis. When sUghtly distended, it has a rounded form, and is still contained within the pelvic cavity ; and when greatly distended it is ovoid in shape, rising into the abdominal cavity, and often extending nearly as high as the umbilicus. It is larger in its vertical diameter than from side to side, and its long axis is directed from above obliquely downwards and backwards, in a line directed from some point between the os pubis and umbilicus (according to its distension) to the end of the coccyx. The bladder, when distended, is slightly curved forwards towards the anterior wall of the abdomen, so as to be more convex behind than in front. In the female it is larger in the transverse than in the vertical diameter, and its capacity is said to be greater than in the male.* ^Yhen moderately distended, it measures about five inches in length, and three inches across, and the ordinary amount which it contains is about a pint.

External iliac Anterior crural External oblique Vermiform appendix artery nerve muscle Profunda vessels Levator ani Corpora TJretlira cavernosa The bladder is divided into a summit, body, base, and neck. The summit, or apex, of the bladder is rounded and directed forwards and upwards ; it is connected to the umbilicus by a fibro-muscular cord, the urachus. The summit of the bladder behind the urachus is covered by peritoneum, whilst the portion in front of the urachus has no peritoneal covering, but rests against the abdominal wall. The urachus is the obliterated remains of a tubular canal which exists in the embryo, and connects the cavity of the bladder with a membranous sac placed external to the abdomen, opposite the umbilicus, called the allantois. It passes upwards, from the apex of the bladder between the transversalis fascia and peri- * Accordmg to Henle, the bladder is considerably smaller in the female than in the male.THE BLADDEE 009 toneum, becoming thinner as it ascends. On each side of it is placed a fibrous cord, the obliterated portion of the hypogastric artery, which, passing upwards from the side of the bladder, approaches the urachus above its summit. In the infant, at birth, it is occasionally found pervious, so that the urine escapes at the umbilicus, and calculi have been found in its canal. The body of the bladder is not covered in front by peritoneum, but is in relation with the triangular ligament, the posterior surface of the symphysis pubis, the Internal obturator muscles, and, when distended, with the abdominal parietes. The posterior surface is covered by peritoneum. It corresponds, in the male, with the rectum; in the female, with the uterus, some convolutions of the small intestine being interposed. Fig. 601.—Vertical median section of the male pelvis. (Henle.) \rsal )tum The side of the bladder is crossed obliquely from below, upwards and forwards, by the obliterated hypogastric artery: above and behind this cord the bladder is covered by peritoneum ; but below and in front of it the serous covering is wanting, and it is connected to the pelvic fascia. The vas deferens passes, in an arched direction, from before backwards, along the side of the bladder, towards its base, crossing in its course the obliterated hypogastric artery, and passing along the inner side of the ureter. The base (fundus) of the bladder is directed downwards and backwards. It varies in extent according to the state of distension of the organ, being very broad when full, but much narrower when empty. In the male, it rests upon the second portion of the rectum, from which it is separated by a reflection of the recto-vesical 3TlOIO THE UEINARY ORGANS fascia. Ifc is covered posteriorly, for a slight extent, by the peritoneum, which is reflected from it upon the rectum, forming the recto-vesical fold. The portion of the bladder in relation with the rectum corresponds to a triangular space bounded, in front, by the prostate gland ; behind, by the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum ; and on each side, by the vesicula seminalis and vas deferens. It is separated from direct contact with the rectum by the recto-vesical fascia. When the bladder is very full, the peritoneal fold is raised with it, and the distance between its reflection and the anus is about four inches ; but this distance is much diminished when the bladder is empty and contracted. In tlie fetiiale, the base of the bladder lies in contact with the lower part of the cervix uteri, is adherent to the anterior wall of the vagina, and separated from the upper part of the anterior surface of the cervix uteri by a fold of the peritoneum. The, so-called, neck (cervix) of the bladder is the point of commencement of the urethra ; there is, however, no tapering part, which would constitute a true neck, but the bladder suddenly contracts to the opening of the urethra. In the male its direction is oblique in the erect posture, and it is surrounded by the prostate gland. In the female its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards. Ligaments.—The bladder is retained in its place by ligaments, which are divided into true and false. The true ligaments are five in number: two anterior, two Fig. 602,— Superficial layer of the epi- thelium of the bladder. Composed of polyhedral cells of A^arious sizes, each with one, two, or three miclei. (Klein and Noble Smith.) Fig. 603.—Deep layers of epithelium of bladder, showing large club-shaped cells above, and smaller, more spindle- shaped cells below—each with an oval nucleus. (Klein and Noble Smith.) lateral, and the urachus. The false ligaments, also five in number, are formed by folds of the peritoneum. The anterior ligaments ('puho-prostatic) extend from the back of the os pubis, one on each side of the symphysis, to the front of the neck of the bladder, over the upper surface of the prostate gland. These ligaments are formed by the recto- vesical fascia, and contain a few muscular fibres prolonged from the bladder. The lateral ligaments, also formed by the recto-vesical fascia, are broader and thinner than the preceding. They are attached to the lateral parts of the prostate, and to the sides of the base of the bladder. The urachus is the fibro-muscular cord already mentioned, extending between the summit of the bladder and the umbilicus. It is broad below, at its attachment to the bladder, and becomes narrower as it ascends. The/aZse ligaments of the bladder are two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The tiuo jjosterior pass forwards, in the male, from the sides of the rectum : in the female, from the sides of the uterus, to the posterior and lateral aspect of the bladder : they form the lateral boundaries of the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum, and contain the obliterated hypogastric arteries, and the ureters, together with vessels and nerves. The tiuo lateral ligaments are reflections of the peritoneum, from the iliac fossae to the sides of the bladder. The s%i]jerior ligament is the prominent fold of peritoneum extending from theSTEUGTUEE OF THE BLADDEE lOI 1 summit of the bladder to the nmbihcus. It covers the urachus and the obliterated hypogastric arteries. Structure.—The bladder is composed of four coats—serous, muscular, sub- mucous, and mucous. The serous coat is partial, and derived from the peritoneum. It invests the posterior surface, from opposite the termination of the two ureters to its summit, and is reflected from this point and from the sides, on to the abdominal and pelvic walls. The muscular coat consists of three layers of unstriped muscular fibre : an external layer, composed of fibres having for the most part a longitudinal arrange- ment ; a middle layer, in which the fibres are arranged, more or less, in a circular manner; and an internal layer, in which the fibres have a general longitudinal arrangement. The fibres of the external longitudinal layer arise from the posterior surface of the body of the os pubis in both sexes (musculi 'puho-vesicalis), and in the male from the adjacent part of the prostate gland and its capsule. They pass, in a more or less longitudinal manner, up the anterior surface of the bladder, over its apex, and then descend along its posterior surface to its base, where they become attached to the prostate in the male, and to the front of the vagina in the female. At the sides of the bladder the fibres are arranged obliquely and intersect one another. This layer has been named the detrusor urince muscle. The middle circular layers are very thinly and irregularly scattered on the body of the organ, and though to some extent placed transversely to the long axis of the bladder, are for the most part arranged obliquely. Towards the lower part of the bladder, round the cervix and commencement of the urethra, they are disposed in a thick circular layer,, forming the syliincter vesicce, which is continuous with the muscular fibres of the prostate gland. The internal longitudinal layer is thin, and its fasciculi have a reticular arrangement, but with a tendency to assume for the most part a longitudinal direction. Two bands of oblique fibres, originating behind the orifices of the ureters, converge to the back part of the prostate gland, and are inserted, by means of a fibrous process, into the middle lobe of that organ. They are the muscles of the ureters, described by Sir C. Bell, who supposed that during the contraction of the bladder they served to retain the oblique direction of the ureters, and so prevent the reflux of the urine into them. The submucous coat consists of a layer of areolar tissue, connecting together the muscular and mucous coats, and intimately united to the latter. The mucous coat is thin, smooth, and of a pale rose colour. It is continuous through the ureters with the lining membrane of the uriniferous tubes, and below with that of the urethra. It is connected loosely to the muscular coat by a layer of areolar tissue, excepting at the trigone, where its adhesion is more close. It is provided with a few mucous follicles; and numerous small racemose glands, lined with columnar epithelium, exist near the neck of the organ. The epithelium covering it is of the transitional variety, consisting of a superficial layer of poly- hedral, flattened cells, each with one, two, or three nuclei ; beneath these, a stratum of large club-shaped cells, with the narrow extremity directed downwards and wedged in between smaller spindle-shaped cells, containing an oval nucleus (figs. 602, 603). Objects seen o?i the inner surface.—-Upon the inner surface of the bladder are seen the orifices of the ureters, the trigone, and the commencement of the urethra. The orifices of the ureters.—These are situated at the base of the trigone, being- distant from each other by about two inches ; they are about an inch and a half from the base of the prostate and the commencement of the urethra. The trigonum vesicce, or trigo7ie vesical, is a triangular smooth surface with the apex directed forwards, situated at the base of the bladder immediately behind the urethral orifice. It is paler in colour than the rest of the mucous membrane, and 3 T 2THE URINARY ORGANS IOI2 Fig. 604.—The bladder and urethra laid open. Seen from above. Coivper's cjland never presents any rugae, even in the collapsed condition of the organ, owing to its intimate adhesion to the subjacent tissue. It is bounded at each posterior angle by the orifices of the ureters, which are placed nearly two inches from each other, and about an inch and a half behind the orifice of the urethra. The trigone corresponds with the interval at the base of the bladder, bounded by the prostate in front, and the vesiculae seminales and vasa deferentia on the sides. Projecting from the lower and anterior part of the bladder into the orifice of the urethra, is a slight elevation of mucous membrane, called the uvula vesiccB. It is formed by a thickening of the submucous tissue. The arteries supplying the bladder are the superior, middle, and inferior vesical in the male, with additional branches from the uterine and vaginal in the female. They are all derived from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac. The obturator and sciatic arteries also supply small visceral branches to the bladder. The veins form a complicated plexus round the neck, sides, and base of the bladder, and terminate in the internal iliac vein. The lymphatics accompany the blood-vessels, passing through the glands surrounding them. The nerves are derived from the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic and from the third and the fourth sacral nerves ; the former supplying the upper part of the organ, the latter its base and neck. According to F. Darwin the sympathetic fibres have ganglia connected with them, which send branches to the vessels and muscular coat. Surface Form.—The surface form of the bladder varies with its degree of disten- sion and under other circumstances. In the young child it is represented by a conical figure, the apex of which, even when the viscus is empty, is situated in the hypogastric region, about an inch above the level of the symphysis pubis. In the adult, when the bladder is empt}^ its apex does not reach above the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the whole organ is situated in the pelvis ; the neck, in the male, correspond- Mentus ing to a line drawn horizontally backwards, through the symphysis a little below its middle. As the bladder becomes distended it gradually rises out of the pelvis into the abdomen and forms a swelling in the hypogastric region, which is perceptible to the hand, as well as to percussion. In extreme distension it reaches into the umbilical region. Under these circumstances it is closely applied to the abdominal wall, without the intervention of peritoneum, so that it can be tapped by an opening in the middle line just above the pubes, without any fear of wounding the serous membrane. "When the rectum is distended, the prostatic portion of the urethra is elongated and the bladder lifted out of the pelvis and the peritoneum pushed upwards. Advantage is taken of this in performing the operation of suprapubic cystotomy. The rectum is distended by an indiarubber bag, which is introduced into this cavity empty, and then filled with ten or twelve ounces of water. If now the bladder is injected with about half a pint of some antiseptic fluid, it will appear above the pubes plainly perceptible to the sight and touch. The peritoneum Orifices of ducts'of Cowper''s glands1013 THE MALE URETHEA will be pushed out of the way, and an incision three inches long may be made in the linea alba from the symphysis pubis upwards without any great risk of wounding the peritoneum. When distended the bladder can be felt in the male, from the rectum, behind the prostate, and fluctuation can be perceived by a bimanual examination, one finger being introduced into the rectum and the distended bladder tapped on the front of the abdomen with the finger of the other hand. This portion of the bladder, that is, the portion felt in the rectum by the finger, is also uncovered by peritoneum, and the bladder may here be punctured from the rectum, in the middle line, without risk of wounding the serous membrane. 8u7'gical Anatomy.—A defect of development, in which the bladder is implicated, is known under the name of extroversion of tJie bladder. In this condition the lower part of the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the bladder are wanting, so that the posterior surface of the bladder presents on the abdominal surface, and is pushed forwards by the pressure of the viscera within the abdomen, formmg a red vascular tumour, on which the openings of the ureters are visible. The penis, except the glans, is rudimentary and is cleft on its dorsal surface, exposing the floor of the urethra, a condition known as ejnspadias. The pelvic bones are also arrested in development (see page 256). The bladder may be ruptured by violence applied to the abdominal wall, when the viscus is distended, without any injury to the bony pelvis, or it may be torn in cases of fracture of the pelvis. The rupture may be either intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal, that is, may implicate the posterior surface of the bladder in the former case, or the anterior surface in the latter. Kupture of the anterior surface alone is, however, very rare. Until recently intraperitoneal rupture was uniformly fatal, but now abdominal section and suturing the rent with Lembert's suture is resorted to, with a very considerable amount of success. The sutures are inserted only through the peritoneal and muscular coats in such a way as to bring the serous surfaces at the margins of the wound into apposition, and one is inserted just beyond each end of the wound. The bladder should be tested as to whether it is water-tight, before closing the external wound. The muscular coat of the bladder undergoes hypertrophy in cases in which there is any obstruction to the flow of mnne. Under these circmnstances the bundles of which the muscular coat consists become much increased in size, and, interlacing in all directions, give rise to what is known as the fasciculated bladder. Between these bundles of muscular fibres the mucous membrane may bulge out, forming sacculi, constituting the sacculated bladder, and in these little pouches phosphatic secretions may collect, forming encysted calculi. The mucous membrane is very loose and lax, except over the trigone, to allow of the distension of the viscus. Various forms of tumour have been found springing from the wall of the bladder. The innocent tumours are the papilloma and the mucous polypus arising from the mucous membrane; the fibrous, from the submucous tissue; and the myoma, originating in the muscular tissue ; and, very rarely, dermoid tumours, the exact origin of which it is difficult to explain. Of the malignant tumours, epithelioma is the most common, but sarcomata are occasionally found in the bladder of children. Puncture of the bladder may be performed either above the pubes or through the rectum, in both cases without wounding the peritoneum. The former plan is generally to be preferred, since in puncture by the rectum a permanent fistula may be left from abscess forming between the rectum and the bladder ; or pelvic cellulitis may be set up ; moreover, it is exceedingly inconvenient to keep a cannula in the rectum. In some cases, in performing this operation the recto-vesical pouch of peritoneum has been wounded, inducing fatal peritonitis. The operation, therefore, has been almost completely abandoned. The Male Uii:^ithea The urethra in the male extends from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It presents a double curve in the flaccid state of the penis, but in the erect state it forms only a single curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards (fig. 599). Its length varies from eight to nine inches ; and it is divided into three portions, the prostatic, membranous, and spongy, the structure and relations of which are essentially different. Except during the passage of the urine or semen, the urethra is a mere transverse cleft or slit, with its upper and under surfaces in contact. At the orifice of the urethra at the end of the penis, the slit is vertical, and in the prostatic portion somewhat arched. The Prostatic portion is the widest and most dilatable part of the canal. It passes through the prostate gland, from its base to its apex, lying nearer its upper than its lower surface. It is about an inch and a quarter in length ; the form of the canal is spindle-shaped, being wider in the middle than at either extremity, and narrowest in front, where it joins the membranous portion. A transverse section ofTHE UEIXAEY ORGANS I014 the canal as it lies in the prostate is horseshoe in shape, the convexity being directed upwards (fig. 605). Upon the floor of the canal is a narro"^ longitudinal ridge, the verumontaiium, or caput gaUinaginis, formed by an elevation of the mucous membrane and its subjacent tissue. It is eight or nine Lines in length, and a line and a half in height ; and contains, according to Kobelt, muscular and erectUe tissues. When distended, it may serve to prevent the passage of the semen backwards into the bladder. On each side of the verumontanum is a slightly depressed fossa, the prostatic sinus, the floor of which is perforated by numerous apertm-es, the orifices of the prostatic ducts : the ducts of the middle lobe opening behind the verumon- tanum. At the fore part of the verumontanum, in the middle line, is a depression, the sinus pocuJaris {lesicuJa prostatica); and upon or within its margins are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts. The sinus pocularis forms a cul-de-sac about a quarter of an inch in length, which runs upwards and backwards in the substance of the prostate beneath the middle lobe ; its prominent upper wall partly forms the verumontanum. Its waUs are composed of fibrous tissue, muscular fibres, and mucous membrane ; and numerous small glands open on its inner siu'face. It has been called by V\'eber, who discovered it, the uterus mcisculinus, from its being developed from the united ends of the rudimentary Miillei-ian ducts, and therefore homolcgous with the uterus in the female. The Membranotis portion of the ui'etkra extends between the apex of the prostate and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. It is the naiTOwest part of the canal (excepting the orifice), and measures three-quarters of an inch along its upper, and half an inch along its lower sui'face, in consequence of the bulb projecting backwards beneath it. Its upper concave sm'face is placed about an inch beneath the pubic arch, from which it is separated by the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis, and some muscular fibres. Its lower convex sm'face is separated from the rectmn by a triangular space, which constitutes the perin^eum. The membranous portion of the urethra perforates both the anterior and posterior layers of the deep peiineal fascia, and receives an investment from them. As it pierces the posterior layer, the fibres around the opening are prolonged backwards over the posterior part of the membranous portion of the m-ethra, and as it pierces the anterior layer a similar prolongation takes place in the opposite direction, investing the anterior part of the membranous portion. It is also surrounded by the Compressor lu'ethrte muscle. The Spongy portion is the longest pan of the m^ethra, and is contained in the corpus spongiostun. It is about six inches in length, and extends from the tennination of the membranous portion to the meatus urinarius. Commencing below the symphysis pubis, it ascends for a short distance, and then curves down- wards. It is narrow, and of uniform size in the body of the penis, measuring about a quarter of an inch in diameter; being dilated behind, within the bulb ; a'^d f _ _:eriorly within the glans j)enis, where it forms the fossa navicular is. Ti- - - -us portion is a nam'e given, in some descriptions of the urethra, to the posterior part of the spongy portion contained within the bulb. The meatus urinarius is the most contracted part of the urethra ; it is a vertical slit, about three hues in length, bounded on each side by two small labia. The inner sm-face of the lining membrane of the urethra, especially on the floor 01 the spong}- portion, presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and f olhcles situated in the submucous tissue, and named the glands of Littre. They vary in size, and then* orifices are directed forwards, so that they may easily intercei)t the point of a catheter in its passage along the canal. One of these lacuns, larger than the rest, is situated on the upper sm-face of the fossa naviculaids, about an inch and a haK from the orifice ; it is called the lacuna magna. Into the bulbous portion are found opening the ducts of Cowper's glands. StrnctTire.—The urethra is composed of a continuous mucous membrane, sup]ooil:ed by a submucous tissue which connects it with the various structures through which it passes.THE MALE URETHRA The mucous coat forms part of the genito-urinary mucous membrane. It is continuous ^^ith the mucous membrane of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys ; externally, with the integument covering the glans penis ; and is prolonged into the ducts of the glands which open into the urethra, viz. Cowper's glands and the prostate gland; and into the vasa deferentia and vesiculge seminales, through the ejaculatory ducts. In the spongy and membranous portions the mucous membrane is arranged in longitudinal folds when the organ is contracted. Small papillae are found upon it, near the orifice ; and its epithelial lining is of the columnar variety, excepting near the meatus, where it is squamous. The submucous tissue consists of a vascular erectile layer ; outside which is a layer of unstriped muscular fibres, arranged in a circular direction, which sepa- rates the mucous membrane and submucous tissue from the tissue of the corpus spongiosum. Surgical Anafvinij.—The urethra may be ruptured by the patient falling astride of any hard substance and striking his perinseum, so that the urethra is crushed agamst the pubic arch. Bleeding will at once take place from the urethra, and this, together with the bruising in the perinaeum and the history of the accident, will at once point to the nature of the injury. The sm'gical anatomy of the urethra is of considerable importance, in connection with the passage of instruments into the bladder. Otis was the first to point out that the urethra is capable of great dilatability, so that, excepting through the external meatus, an instrument corresponding to i8 English gauge (29 French) can usually be passed without damage. The orifice of the m-ethra is not so dilatable and therefore frequently requires slitting. A recognition of this dilatabiHty caused Bigelow to very considerably modify the operation of lithotrity and introduce that of litholapaxy. In passing catheters, especially fine ones, the point of the instrument should be kept as far as possible along the upper wall of the canal, as the j)oint is otherwise very liable to enter one of the lacunae. Stricture of the urethra is a disease of very common occm-rence, and is generally situated in the spongy portion of the urethra, most commonly in the bulbous portion, just in front of the membranous urethra, but in a veiw considerable number of cases in the penile or ante-scrotal part of the canal.MALE OEGANS OF GENERATION The Prostate Gland THE Prostate Gland {irpoto-TrjfXL, to stand before) is a pale, firm, glandular body, which is placed immediately in front of the neck of the bladder and around the commencement of the urethra. It is placed in the pelvic cavity, behind and below the symphysis pubis, posterior to the deep perineal fascia, and rests upon the Fig. 605."—Transverse section of the prostate gland; showing the urethra, with the eminence of the caput gallinaginis; beneath it the sinus pocularis and ejaculatory ducts. rectum, through which it may be distinctly felt, especially when enlarged. In shape and size it resembles a chestnut. Its base is directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder. Its apex is directed forwards to the deep perineal fascia, which it touches. Its under surface is smooth, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and rests on the rectum, to which it is connected by dense areolar tissue. Its upper surface is flattened, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and placed about three-quarters of an inch below the pubic symphysis. It measures about an inch and a half in its transverse diameter at the base, an inch in its antero-posterior diameter, and three-quarters of an inch in depth. Its weight is about six drachms. It is held in its position by the anterior hgaments of1017 THE PROSTATE GLAND the bladder {piobo-prostatic); by the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, which invests the commencement of the membranous portion of the m^ethra and prostate gland; and by the anterior portion of the Levator ani muscle (levator prostatcB), which passes down on each side from the symphysis pubis and anterior ligament of the bladder to the sides of the prostate. The prostate consists of two lateral lobes and a middle lobe. The huo lateral lobes are of equal size, separated by a deep notch behind, and by a shght furrow upon their upper and lower surfaces, which indicates the bilobed condition of the organ in some animals. The third, or middle lobe, is a small transverse band, occasionally a rounded or triangular prominence, placed between the two lateral lobes, at the posterior part of the organ. It lies immediately beneath the neck of the bladder, behind the commencement of the urethra, and above and between the ejaculatory ducts. Its existence is not constant; but it is occasionally found at an early period of life, as well as in adults, and in old age. The prostate gland is perforated by the urethra and the ejaculatory ducts. The urethra usually lies about one-third nearer its upper than its lower surface; occasionally, the prostate surrounds only the lower three-fourths of this tube, and more rarely the urethra runs through the lower instead of the upper part of the gland. The ejaculatory ducts pass forwards obliquely through the lower part of the prostate, and open into the prostatic portion of the urethra. Structure.—The prostate is enclosed in a thin but firm fibrous capsule, distinct from that derived from the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, and separated from it by a plexus of veins. Its substance is of a pale reddish-grey colour, of great density, and not easily torn. It consists of glandular substance and muscular tissue. The muscular tissue, according to Kolliker, constitutes the proper stroma of the prostate : the connective tissue being very scanty, and simply forming thin trabeculae between the muscular fibres, in which the vessels and nerves of the gland ramify. The muscular tissue is arranged as follows : immediately beneath the fibrous ca.psule is a dense layer, which forms an investing sheath for the gland ; secondly, around the urethra, as it lies in the prostate, is another dense layer of circular fibres, continuous behind with the internal layer of the muscular coat of the bladder, and in front blending with the fibres surrounding the membranous portion of the urethra. Between these two layers, strong bands of muscular tissue, which decussate freely, form meshes in which the glandular structure of the organ is embedded. In that part of the gland which is situated above the urethra the muscular tissue is especially dense, and there is here little or no gland-tissue ; while in that part which is below the urethra the muscular tissue presents a wide- meshed structure, which is densest at the upper part of the gland—that is, near the bladder—becoming looser and more sponge-like towards the apex of the organ. The glandular substance is composed of numerous follicular pouches, opening into elongated canals, which join to form from twelve to twenty small excretory ducts. The follicles are connected together by areolar tissue, supported by prolongations from the fibrous capsule and muscular stroma, and enclosed in a delicate capillary plexus. The epithelium lining of both the canals and the terminal vesicles is of the columnar variety. The prostatic ducts open into the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra. *^ Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the prostate are derived from the internal pudic, vesical, and haemorrhoidal. Its ve^7^s form a plexus around the sides and base of the gland ; they receive in front the dorsal vein of the penis, and terminate in the internal iliac vein. The nerves are derived from the pelvic plexus. Surgical Anatomy.—The relation of the prostate to the rectum should be noted: by means of the finger introduced into the gut, the surgeon detects enlargement or other disease of this organ; he can feel the apex of the gland, which is the guide to Cock'sMALE OEGANS OF GENEKATION joiS. operation for stricture; he is enabled also by the same means to direct the point of a catheter, when its introduction is attended with difficulty either from injury or disease of the membranous or prostatic portions of the m^ethra. When the finger is introduced into the bowel, the surgeon may, in some cases, especially in boys, learn the position, as well as the size and weight, of a calculus in the bladder; and in the operation for its removal, if, as is not unfrequently the case, it should be lodged behind an enlarged prostate, it ma^' be displaced fi'om its position by pressing upwards the base of the bladder from the rectum. The prostate gland is occasionally the seat of suppuration, either due to injury, gonorrhoea, or tuberculous disease. The gland being enveloped in a dense unyielding capsule determines the course of the abscess and also explains the great pain which is present in the acute form of the disease. The abscess most frequently bursts into the urethra, the direction in which there is least resistance, but may occasionally burst into the rectum, or more rarely in the perinseum. In advanced life the prostate becomes considerably enlarged and projects into the bladder so as to impede the passage of the urine. According to Dr. Messer's researches, conducted at Greenwich Hospital, it would seem that such obstruction exists in 20 per cent, of all men over sixty years of age. In some cases the enlargement affects principally the lateral lobes, which may undergo considerable enlargement without causing much inconvenience. In other cases it would seem that the middle lobe enlarges most, and even a small enlargement of this lobe may act injuriously^, by forming a sort of valve over the urethral orifice, preventing the passage of the urine, and blocking more completely the orifice the more the patient strains. In consequence of the enlargement of the x^rostate, a pouch is formed at the base of the bladder behind the projection, in which water collects, and cannot be entirely expelled. It becomes decomposed and ammoniacal, and leads to cystitis. For this condition 'prostatectomy' is sometimes done. The bladder is opened by an incision above the symphysis pubis, the mucous membrane incised, and the enlarged and projecting middle lobe enucleated. Cowpee's Glands Cowper's Glands are tw^o small rounded and somewhat lobulated bodies, of a yellow colom% about the size of peas, placed beneath the fore part of the membranous portion of the urethra, between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia. They lie close behind the bulb, and are enclosed by the transverse fibres of the Compressor urethraB muscle. Their existence is said to be constant : they gradually diminish in size as age advances. Structure.—Each gland consists of several lobules, held together by a fibrous investment. Each lobule consists of a number of acini, lined by columnar epithelial cells, opening into one duct, which, joining with the ducts of other lobules outside the gland, form a single excretory duct. The excretory duct of each gland, nearly an inch in length, passes obliquely forwards beneath the mucous membrane, and opens by'a minute orifice on the floor of the bulbous portion of the urethra. Their existence is said to be constant ; they gradually diminish in size as age advances. The Penis The Penis is the organ of copulation. It consists of a root, body, and extremity or glans penis. The root is firmly connected to the rami of the os pubis and ischium by two strong tapering fibrous processes, the crura ; and to the front of the symphysis pubis by the suspensory ligament, a strong band of fibrous tissue which passes downwards from the front of the symphysis pubis to the upper surface of the root of the penis, where it blends with the fascial sheath of the organ. The extremity, or glans penis, presents the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downwards. At its summit is a vertical fissure, the orifice of the urethra {^neattis iirinarius). The base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis ; and behind the corona is a deep constriction, the cervix. Upon both of these parts, numerous small sebaceous glands are found, the glandules, Tysonii odorifercd. They secrete a sebaceous matter of very peculiar odour, which probably contains caseine, and becomes easily decomposed. The body of the penis is the part between the root and extremity. In the flaccid condition of the organ it is cylindrical, but when erect has a triangular prismatic form wdth rounded angles, the broadest side being turned upwards, and1019 THE PENIS called the dorsum. The body is covered by integument, and contains in its interior a large portion of the urethra. The integument covering the penis is remarkable for its thinness, its dark colour, its looseness of connection with the deeper parts of the organ, and its containing no adipose tissue. At the root of the penis, the integument is continuous with that upon the pubes and scrotum ; and at the neck of the gians it leaves the surface, and becomes folded upon itself to form i\iQiwepuce. The internal layer of the prepuce is attached behind to the cervix, and approaches in character to a mucous membrane; from the cervix it is reflected over the glans penis, and at the meatus urinarius is continuous with the mucous lining of the urethra. The mucous membrane covering the gians penis contains no sebaceous glands; but projecting from its free surface are a number of small, highly sensitive papillae. At the back part of the meatus urinarius a fold of mucous membrane passes backwards to the bottom of a depressed raphe, where it is continuous with the prepuce ; this fold is termed the frceimm pr^Bputii. Structure of the Penis.—The penis is composed of a mass of erectile tissue, enclosed in three cylindrical fibrous compartments. Of these, two, the corpora cavernosa, are placed side by side along the upper part of the organ ; the third, or corpus spongiosum, encloses the urethra, and is placed below. The Corpora Cavernosa form the chief part of the body of the penis. They consist of two fibrous cylindrical tubes, placed side by side, and intimately connected along the median line for their anterior three-fourths, whilst at their back part they separate from each other to form the crura, which are two strong tapering fibrous processes firmly connected to the rami of the os pubis and ischium. Each crus commences by a blunt pointed process in front of the tuberosity of the ischium ; and, before its junction with its fellow to form the body of the penis, it presents a slight enlargement, named by Kobelt, the hulh of the corpns cavernosum. Just beyond this point they become constricted, and retain an equal diameter to their anterior extremity, where they form a single rounded end, which is received into a fossa in the base of the glans penis. A median groove on the upper surface lodges the dorsal vein of the penis, and the groove on the under surface receives the corpus spongiosum. The root of the penis is connected to the symphysis pubis by the suspensory ligame*nt. Structure.—The corpora cavernosa are surrounded by a strong fibrous envelope, consisting of two sets of fibres: the one, longitudinal in direction, being common to the two corpora cavernosa, and investing them in a common covering ; the other, internal, being circular in direction, and being proper to each corpus cavernosum. The internal circular fibres by their junction at one part form an incomplete partition or septum between the two bodies. The sephmi between the two corpora cavernosa forms an imperfect partition; it is thick and complete behind, but in front it is incomplete, and consists of a number of vertical bands, which are arranged hke the teeth of a comb, whence the name which it has received, septum pectiniforme. These bands extend between the dorsal and the urethral surface of the corpora cavernosa. This fibrous investment is extremely dense, of considerable thickness, and consists of bundles of shining white fibres, with an admixture of well-developed elastic fibres, so that it is possessed of great elasticity. From the internal surface of the fibrous envelope, as well as from the sides of the septum, are given off a number of bands or cords, which cross the interior of the corpora cavernosa in all directions, subdividing them into a number of separate compartments, and giving the entire structure a spongy appearance. These bands and cords are called traheculce, and consist of white fibrous tissue, elastic fibres, and plain muscular fibres. In them are contained numerous arteries and nerves. The component fibres of which the trabeculaa are composed are larger and stronger round the circumference than at the centre of the corpora cavernosa ; they are also thicker behind than m front. The interspaces, on the contrary, are larger at the centre than at the circumference, their long diameter being directedMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION I020 transversely; they are largest anteriorly. They are occupied by venous blood, and are lined by a layer of flattened cells similar to the endothelial lining of veins. The whole of the structure of the corpora cavernosa, contained within the fibrous sheath, consists therefore of a sponge-like tissue of areolar spaces, freely communicating with each other and filled with venous blood. The spaces may therefore be regarded as large cavernous veins. The arteries, bringing the blood to these spaces are the arteries of the corpora cavernosa and branches from the dorsal artery of the penis, which perforate the fibrous capsule, along the upper surface, especially near the fore part of the organ. These arteries on entering the cavernous structure divide into branches, which are supported and enclosed by the trabeculae. Some of these terminate in a capillary network, the branches of which open directly into the cavernous spaces ; others assume a tendril-like appearance, and form convoluted and somewhat dilated vessels which were named by Miiller, helicim arteries. They project into the spaces, and from them are given off small capillary branches to supply the trabecular structure. They are bound down in the spaces by fine fibrous processes, and are more abundant in the back part of the corpora cavernosa (fig. 606). The blood from the cavernous spaces is returned by a series of vessels, some of which emerge in considerable numbers from the base of the gians penis and FiGr. 606.—From the peripheral portion of the corpus cavemosiim penis under a low magnifying power.

Connection of the arterial twigs (rt) with the cavernous spaces. converge on the dorsum of the organ to form the dorsal vein; others pass out on the upper surface of the corpora cavernosa and join the dorsal vein ; some emerge from the under surface of the corpora cavernosa and, receiving branches from the corpus spongiosum, wind round the sides of the penis to terminate in the dorsal vein ; but the greater number pass out at the root of the penis, and join the prostatic plexus. The Corpus Spongiosum encloses the urethra, and is situated in the groove on the under surface of the corpora cavernosa. It commences posteriorly in front of the deep perineal fascia, between the diverging crura of the corpora cavernosa, where it forms a rounded enlargement, the hulh ; and terminates, anteriorly, in another expansion, the glans penis, which overlaps the anterior rounded extremity of the corpora cavernosa. The central portion, or body of the corpus spongiosum, is cylindrical, and tapers slightly from behind forwards. The hulh varies in size in different subjects; it receives a fibrous investment from the anterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, and is surrounded by the Accelerator urinag muscle. The urethra enters the bulb nearer its upper than its lower surface, being surrounded by a layer of erectile tissue, a thin prolongation of which is continued backwards round the membranous and prostatic portions of the canal to the neck of the bladder, lying between the two layers of muscular tissue. The portion of the bulb below the urethra presents a partial division intoTHE SCROTUM I02I two lobes, being marked externally by a linear raphe, whilst internally there projects inwards, for a short distance, a thin fibrous septum, more distinct in early life. Structure.—The corpus spongiosum consists of a strong fibrous envelope, enclosing a trabecular structure, which contains in its meshes erectile tissue. The fibrous envelope is thinner, whiter in colour, and more elastic than that of the corpora cavernosa. The trabeculse are dehcate, uniform in size, and the meshes between them small; their long diameter, for the most part, corresponding with that of the penis. The external envelope or outer coat of the corpus spongiosum is formed partly of unstriped muscular fibre, and a layer of the same tissue immediately surrounds the canal of the urethra. The kjmphatics of the penis consist of a superficial and deep set; the former are derived from a dense network on the skin of the glans and prepuce and from the mucous membrane of the urethra, and terminate in the superficial inguinal glands ; the latter emerge from the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, and, passing beneath the pubic arch, join the deep lymphatics of the pelvis. The nerves are derived from the internal pudic nerve and the pelvic plexus. On the glans and bulb some filaments of the cutaneous nerves have Pacinian bodies connected with them, and, according to Krause, many of them terminate in a peculiar form of end-bulb. Surgical Anatomy.—The penis occasionally requires removal for malignant disease. Usually, removal of the ante-scrotal portion is all that is necessary, but sometimes it is re- quisite to remove the whole organ from its attachment to the rami of the os pubis and ischium. The former operation is performed either b.y cutting off the whole of the anterior part of the penis with one sweep of the knife ; or, what is better, cutting through the corpora cavernosa from the dorsum, and then separating the corpus spongiosum from them, dividing it at a level nearer the glans penis. The mucous membrane of the urethra is then slit up, and the edges of the flap attached to the external skin, in order to prevent contraction of the orifice, which would otherwise take place. The vessels which require ligature are the two dorsal arteries of the penis, the arteries of the corpora cavernosa, and the artery of the septum. When the entire organ requires removal, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position, and an incision is made round the root of the penis, and carried down the median line of the scrotum as far as the perinaeum. The two halves of the scrotum sire then separated from each other, and a catheter having been introduced into the bladder as a guide, the membranous portion of the urethra in front of the triangular ligament is separated from the corpora cavernosa and divided, the ca.theter having been withdrawn, just behind the bulb. The suspensory ligament is now severed, and the crura separated from the bone with a periosteum scraper, and the whole penis removed. The membranous portion of the urethra, which has not been removed, is now to be attached to the skin at the posterior extremity of the incision in the perinteum. The remainder of the wound is to be brought together, free drainage being provided for. The Testes and their Coverings (fig. 607) The Testes are two small glandular organs, which secrete the semen; they are situated in the scrotum, being suspended by the spermatic cords. At an early period of foetal life the testes are contained in the abdominal cavity, behind the peritoneum. Before birth they descend to the inguinal canal, along which they pass with the spermatic cord, and, emerging at the external abdominal ring, they descend into the scrotum, becoming invested in their course by numerous coverings derived from the serous, muscular, and fibrous layers of the abdominal parietes, as well as by the scrotum. The coverings of the testis are—the 1 Scrotum. JJartos 1 Intercolumnar, or External spermatic fascia. Cremasteric fascia. Infundibuliform, or Fascia propria (Internal spermatic fascia). Tunica vaginalis. The Scrotum is a cutaneous pouch which contains the testes and part of the spermatic cords. It is divided into two lateral halves by a median line, or m2)lie,MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION I022 which is continued forwards to the under surface of the penis, and backwards along the middle line of the perinaeum to the anus. Of these two lateral portions the left is longer than the right, and corresponds with the greater length of the spermatic cord on the left side. Its external aspect varies under different circumstances : thus under the influence of warmth, and in old and debilitated persons, it becomes elongated and flaccid; but, under the influence of cold, and in the young and robust, it is short, corrugated, and closely applied to the testes. The scrotum consists of two layers, the integument and the dartos. The integument is very thin, of a brownish colour, and generally thrown into folds or rugae. It is provided with sebaceous follicles, the secretion of which has a peculiar odour, and is beset with thinly scattered, crisp hairs, the roots of which are seen through the skin. The dartos is a thin layer of loose reddish tissue, endowed with contractility : it forms the proper tunic of the scrotum, is continuous, around the base of the scrotum, with the two layers of the superficial fascia of the groin and perineum.

The dartos is closely united to the skin externally, but connected with the subjacent parts by delicate areolar tissue, upon which it glides with the greatest facility. The dartos is very vascular, and consists of a loose areolar tissue, con- taining unstriped muscular fibre, but no fat. Its contractility is slow, and excited by cold and mechanical stimuli, but not by electricity. The intercolumnar fascia is a thin membrane, derived from the margin of the pillars of the external abdominal ring, during the descent of the testis in the foetus, which is prolonged downwards around the surface of the cord and testis. It is separated from the dartos by loose areolar tissue, which allows of considerable movement of the latter upon it, but is intimately connected with the succeeding layers. The cremasteric fascia consists of scattered bundles of muscular fibres (Cremaster muscle), connected together into a continuous covering by intermediateTHE SPERMATIC CORD 1023 areolar tissue. The muscular fibres are derived from the lower border of the Internal oblique muscle, during the descent of the testis. The fascia propria is a thin membranous layer, which loosely invests the surface of the cord. It is a continuation downwards of the infundibuliform process of the fascia transversalis, and the subperitoneal areolar tissue, and is also acquired during- the descent of the testis in the foetus. The tunica vaginalis is described with the proper covering of the testis. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the coverings of the testis are : the superficial and deep external pudic, from the femoral; the superficial perineal branch of the internal pudic ; and the cremasteric branch from the epigastric. The veins follow the course of the corresponding arteries. The lymphatics terminate in the inguinal glands. The nerves are : the ilio-inguinal branch of the lumbar plexus, the two superficial perineal branches of the internal pudic nerve, the inferior pudendal branch of the small sciatic nerve, and the genital branch of the genito- crural nerve. The Spermatic Cord extends from the internal abdominal ring, where the structures of which it is composed converge, to the back part of the testicle. In the abdominal wall the cord passes obliquely along the inguinal canal, lying at first beneath the Internal oblique, and upon the fascia transversalis; but nearer the pubes, it rests upon Poapart's ligament, having the aponeurosis of the External oblique in front of it, and the conjoined tendon behind it. It then escapes at the external ring, and descends nearly vertically into the scrotum. The left cord is rather longer than the right, consequently the left testis hangs somewhat lower than its fellow. Structure of the Spermatic Cord.—The spermatic cord is composed of arteries, veins, lymphatics, nerves, and the excretory duct of the testicle. These structures are connected together by areolar tissue, and invested by the fasciae brought down by the testicle in its descent. The arteries of the cord are : the spermatic, from the aorta ; the artery of the vas deferens, from the superior vesical; and the cremasteric, from the deep epigastric. The spermatic artery, a branch of the abdominal aorta, escapes from the abdomen at the internal or deep abdominal ring, and accompanies the other con- stituents of the spermatic cord along the inguinal canal and through the external abdominal ring into the scrotum. It then descends to the testicle, and, becoming- tortuous, divides into several branches, two or three of which accompany the vas deferens and supply the epididymis, anastomosing with the artery of the vas deferens ; others pierce the back of the tunica albuginea and supply the substance of the testis. The cremasteric artery is a branch of the deep epigastric artery. It accom- panies the spermatic cord and supplies the Cremaster muscle and other coverings of the cord, anastomosing with the spermatic artery. The artery of the vas deferens, a branch of the superior vesical, is a long slender vessel, which accompanies the vas deferens, ramifying upon the coats of that duct, and anastomosing with the spermatic artery near the testis. The spermatic veins emerge from the back of the testis, and receive tributaries from the epididymis ; they unite and form a convoluted plexus {plexus pampini- formis), which forms the chief mass of the cord : the vessels composing this plexus are very numerous, and ascend along the cord in front of the vas deferens ; below the external or superficial abdominal ring they unite to form three or four veins, which pass along the spermatic canal, and, entering the abdomen through the internal or deep abdominal ring, coalesce to form two veins. These again unite to form a single vein, which opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle, and on the left side into the renal vein at a right angle. The lymphatic vessels terminate in the lumbar glands. The nerves are the spermatic plexus from the sympathetic, joined by filaments from the pelvic plexus which accompany the artery of the vas deferens.I024 MALE OEGANS OF GENEEATION • Surgical Anatomy.—The scrotum forms an admirable covering for the protection of the testicle. This body, lying suspended and loose in the cavity of the scrotmri and surrounded by a serous membrane, is capable of great mobility, and can therefore easily slip about within the scrotum, and thus avoid injuries from blows or squeezes. The skin of the scrotum is very elastic and capable of great distension, and on account of the looseness and amount of subcutaneous tissue, the scrotum becomes greatly enlarged in cases of oedema, to which this part is especially liable on account of its dependent position. The scrotum is frequently the seat of epithelioma ; this is no doubt due to the rugae on its surface, which favour the lodgment of dirt, and this, causing irritation, is the exciting cause of the disease, which is especially common in chimney-sw^eeps from the lodgment of soot. The scrotum is also the part most frequently affected by elephantiasis. On account of the looseness of the subcutaneous tissue, considerable extravasations of blood may take place from very slight injuries. It is therefore generally recommended never to apply leeches to the scrotum, since they may lead to considerable ecchymosis, but rather to puncture one or more of the superficial veins of the scrotum in cases where local blood-letting from this part is judged to be desirable. The muscular fibre in the dartos causes contraction and considerable diminution in the size of a wound of the scrotum, as after the operation of castration, and is of assistance in keeping the edges together, and covering the exposed parts. The Testes The Testes are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords. As the left spermatic cord is rather longer than the right one, the left testicle hangs somewhat lower than its fellow. Each gland is of an oval form, compressed laterally, and having an oblique position in the scrotum; the upper extremity being directed forwards and a little outwards ; the lower, backwards and a little inwards; the anterior convex border looks forwards and downwards; the posterior or straight border, to which the cord is attached, backwards and upwards. The anterior and lateral surfaces, as well as both extremities of the organ, are convex, free, smooth, and invested by the tunica vaginalis. The posterior border, to which the cord is attached, receives only a partial investment from that mem- brane. Lying upon the outer edge of this posterior border is a long, narrow, flattened body, named, from its relation to the testis, the epididymis (StSu/xos, testis). It consists of a central portion, or body, an upper enlarged extremity, the globus major, or head; and a lower pointed extremity, the tail, or globus minor. The globus major is intimately connected with the upper end of the testicle by means of its efferent ducts ; and the globus minor is connected with its lower end by cellular tissue, and a reflection of the tunica vaginalis. The outer surface and upper and lower ends of the epididymis are free and covered by serous membrane ; the body is also completely invested by it, excepting along its posterior border. The epididymis is connected to the back of the testis by a fold of the serous mem- brane. Attached to the upper end of the testis, or to the epididymis, are one or more small pedunculated bodies. One of them is pretty constantly found between the globus major of the epididymis and the testicle, and is believed to be the remains of the upper extremity of the Miillerian duct (page 107). It is termed the hydatid of Morgagni. When the testicle is removed from the body, the position of the vas deferens, on the posterior surface of the testicle and inner side of the epididymis, marks the side to which the gland has belonged. Size and weight.—The average dimensions of this gland are from one and a half to two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and an inch and a quarter in the antero-posterior diameter; and the weight varies from six to eight drachms, the left testicle being a little the larger. The testis is invested by three tunics, the tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa. The Tunica Vaginalis is the serous covering of the testis. It is a pouch of serous membrane, derived from the peritoneum during the descent of the testis in the foetus, from the abdomen into the scrotum. After its descent, that portion of the pouch which extends from the internal ring to near the upper part of the gland becomes obliterated, the lower portion remaining as a shut sac, which invests the outer surface of the testis, and is reflected on to the internal surface of the1025 COVERINGS OF THE TESTIS scrotum; hence it may be described as consisting of a visceral and parietal portion. The visceral portion {tunica vaginalis propria) covers the outer surface of the testis, as well as the epididymis, connecting the latter to the testis by means of a distinct fold. From the posterior border of the gland, it is reflected on to the internal surface of the scrotum. The parietal portion of the serous membrane {tunica vagifialis reflexa) is far more extensive than the visceral portion, extending upwards for some distance in front, and on the inner side of the cord, and reaching below the testis. The inner surface of the tunica vaginalis is free, smooth, and covered by a layer of endothelial cells. The interval between the visceral and parietal layers of this membrane constitutes the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. The obliterated portion of the pouch may generally be seen as a fibro-cellular thread lying in the loose areolar tissue around the spermatic cord; sometimes this may be traced as a distinct band from the upper end of the inguinal canal, where it is connected with the peritoneum, down to the tunica vaginalis.; sometimes it gradually becomes lost on the spermatic cord. Occasionally no trace of it can be detected. In some cases it happens that Fig. 608.—The testis in situ, the tunica the pouch of peritoneum does not become vaginahs having been laid open, obliterated, but the sac of the peritoneum communicates with the tunica vaginalis. This may give rise to one of the varieties of oblique inguinal hernia (page 1055). Or in other cases the pouch may contract, but not become entirely obliterated; it then forms a minute canal leading from the peritoneum to the tunica vaginalis.* The Tunica Albuginea is the fibrous ^'^'^^^^^^"^-^^''^ covering of the testis. It is a dense fibrous ^^'^^^ membrane, of a bluish-white colour, com- posed of bundles of white fibrous tissue, which interlace in every direction. Its outer surface is covered by the tunica vaginalis, except along its posterior bor- der, at the points of attachment of the epididymis ; hence the tunica albuginea is usually considered as a fibro-serous mem- brane, like the pericardium. This mem- brane surrounds the glandular structure of the testicle, and, at its posterior border, is reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum, called the 7nediastinum testis {corpus High- morianum). The mediastinum testis extends from the upper, nearly to the lower border of the gland, and is wider above than below. From the front and sides of this septum numerous slender fibrous cords and imperfect septa {trabeculce) are given off, which radiate towards the surface of the organ, and are attached to the inner surface of the tunica albuginea. They therefore divide the interior of the organ into a number of incomplete spaces, which are somewhat cone-shaped, being broad at their bases at the surface of the gland, and becoming narrower as they converge to the mediastinum. The mediastinum supports the vessels and ducts of the testis in their passage to and from the substance of the gland. * It is recorded that in the post-mortem exanimation of Sir Astley Cooper, this minute canal was found on both sides of the body. Sir Astley Cooper states that when a student he suffered from inguinal hernia ; probably this was of the congenital variety, and the canal found after death was the remains of the one down which the hernia travelled.— Lancet, vol. ii. 1824, p. 116. 3UT026 MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION The Tunica Vasculosa (jj/a mater testis) is the vascular layer of the testis, consisting of a plexus of blood-vessels, held together by a delicate areolar tissue. It covers the inner surface of the tunica albuginea and the different septa in the interior of the gland, and therefore forms an internal investment to all the spaces of which the gland is composed. Structure.—The glandular structure of the testis consists of numerous lobules (lohiill testis). Their number, in a single testis, is estimated by Berres at 250, and by Krause at 400. They differ in size according to their position, those in the middle of the gland being larger and longer. The lobules are conical in shape, the base being directed towards the circumference of the organ, the apex towards the mediastinum. Each lobule is contained in one of the intervals between the fibrous cords and vascular processes w^hich extend between the mediastinum testis and the tunica albuginea, and consists of from one to three, or more, minute convoluted tubes, the tuhuli seminiferi. The tubes may be separately unravelled, by careful dissection under water, and may be seen to commence either by free c^cal ends, or by anastomotic loops. The total number of tubes is considered by Munro to be about 300, and the length of each about sixteen feet; by Lauth, their number is estimated at 840, and their average length two feet and a quarter. Their diameter varies from oott to of an inch. The tubuli are pale in colour in early life, but in old age they acquire a deep yellow tinge, from containing much fatty matter. They consist of a membrana propria, inside which are several layers of epithelial cells, the seminal cells. The membrana propria is a hyaline structure, consisting of several membranous layers, containing oval flattened nuclei, at regular intervals, super- imposed on one another. The seminal cells or lining epithelium differ in different tubules. In some tubes they may be seen to consist of an outer layer, next the membrana propria, and two or more layers of inner cells. The former cells are more or less polyhedral in shape, uniform in size, and contain an oval or spherical nucleus; the latter cells, those comprising the inner layers, are spherical and more loosely connected together. The nucleus of most or all of them is in the process of indirect division (karyokinesis, page 8), and in consequence of this numerous small spherical daughter-cells are to be seen, lying nearest to the lumen and closely connected together. These small daughter-cells are named syermatohlasts, and by a series of changes become converted into spermatozoa. In other tubes the gradual transition of the spermatoblasts into spermatozoa may be traced. In some tubes or parts of tubes the daughter-cells may be seen to have assumed a pear shape^ with the pointed end, in which the nucleus is to be found, directed towards the inner seminal cells, while the broad part is directed into the lumen of the tube. In other parts of a tube the broad end may be seen to have become elongated into a rod-shaped body, which constitutes the middle piece of the spermatozoon, while the nucleus forms the head. Again, in other parts of the tubes these young spermatozoa may be seen collected together into fan-shaped groups, and from their distal end—that is to say, the end projecting into the lumen of the tube—a thin long filament, called the tail, is growing out. In the young subject the seminal cells present somewhat the appearance of an epithelial lining, and do not almost fill the tube, as in the adult testis. The tubules are enclosed in a delicate plexus of capillary vessels, and are held together by an intertubular connective tissue, which presents large interstitial spaces lined by endothelium, which are believed to be the rootlets of the lymphatic vessels of the testis. In the apices of the lobules, the tubuli become less convoluted, assume a nearly straight course, and unite together to form from twenty to thirty larger ducts, of about -V^ti of an inch in diameter, and these, from their straight course, are called vasa recta. The vasa recta enter the fibrous tissue of the mediastinum, and pass upwards and backwards, forming, in their ascent, a close network of anastomosing tubes which are merely channels in the fibrous stroma, having no proper walls ; this constitutes the rete testis. At the upper end of the mediastinum, the vessels of1027 THE VAS DEFERENS the rete testis terminate in from twelve to fifteen or twenty ducts, the vasa efferentia : they perforate the tunica albuginea, and carry the seminal fluid from the testis to the epididymis. Their course is at first straight, they then become enlarged, and exceedingly convoluted, and form a series of conical masses, the coni vasculosi, which, together, constitute the globus major of the epididymis. Each cone consists of a single convoluted duct, from six to eight inches in length, the diameter of which gradually decreases from the testis to the epididymis. Op- posite the bases of the cones, the efferent vessels open at narrow intervals into a single duct, which constitutes, by its complex convolutions, the body and globus minor of the epididymis. When the convolutions of this tube are un- ravelled, it measures upwards of twenty feet in length, and increases in breadth and thickness as it approaches the vas deferens. The convolutions are held together by fine areolar tissue, and by bands of fibrous tissue. The vasa recta are of smaller diameter than the seminal tubes, and have very thin parietes. They, as well as the channels of the rete testis, are lined by a single layer of flattened epithelium. The vasa eft'erentia and the tube of the epi- didymis have walls of considerable thick- ness, on account of the presence in them of muscular tissue, which is principally arranged in a circular manner. These tubes are lined by columnar ciliated epi- thelium. The Vas Deferens, the excretory duct of the testis, is the continuation of the epididymis. Commencing at the lower part of the globus minor, it ascends along the posterior surface of the testis and inner side of the epididymis, and along the back part of the spermatic cord, through the spermatic canal to the internal or deep abdominal ring. From the ring it curves round the outer side of the epigastric artery, crosses the external iliac vessels, and descends into the pelvis at the side of the bladder; it arches backwards and downwards to its base, crossing over the obliterated hypogastric artery, and to the inner side of the ureter. At the base of the bladder it lies between that viscus and the rectum, running along the inner border of the vesicula seminalis. In this situation it becomes enlarged and sacculated, forming the amjndla ; and then, becoming narrowed at the base of the prostate, unites with the duct of the vesicula seminalis to form the ejaculatory duct. The vas deferens presents a hard and cord-like sensation to the fingers ; it is about two feet in length, of cylindrical form, and about a line and a quarter in diameter. Its walls are dense, measuring one-third of a line ; and its canal is extremely small, measuring about half a line. Structure.—The vas deferens consists of three coats : i. An external, or cellular coat. 2. A muscular coat, which in the greater part of the tube consists of two layers of unstriped muscular fibre : an outer, longitudinal in direction, and an inner, circular ; but in addition to these, at the commencement of the vas deferens, there is a third layer, consisting of longitudinal fibres, placed internal to the circular stratum, between it and the mucous membrane. 3. An internal, or mucous coat, which is pale, and arranged in longitudinal folds ; its epithelial covering is of the columnar variety. A long narrow tube, the vas aherrans of Haller, is occasionally found connected 3 u 2 Fig. 60Q.—Vertical section of the testicle, to show the arrangement of the ducts.I028 MALE OEGANS OF GENERATION with the lower part of the canal of the epididymis, or with the commencement of the vas deferens. It extends up into the cord for about two or three inches, where it terminates by a blind extremity, which is occasionally bifurcated. Its length varies from an inch and a half to fourteen inches, and sometimes it becomes dilated towards its extremity; more commonly it retains the same diameter throughout. Its structure is similar to that of the vas deferens. Occasionally it is found unconnected with the epididymis. Surgical Anatomy.—The testicle frequently requires removal for malignant disease ; in tuberculous disease, to prevent systemic infection ; in cystic disease ; in cases of large hernia testis, and in some instances of incompletely descended or misplaced testicle. The operation is a comparatively simple one. An incision is made from the external ring to the bottom of the scrotum, into the tunica vaginalis. The coverings are shelled off the organ, and the mesorchium, stretching between the back of the testicle and the scrotum, divided. The cord is then isolated, and an aneurism needle, armed with a double ligatiu^e, passed under it, as high as is thought necessary, and the cord tied in two places, and divided between the ligatures. Sometimes, in cases of malignant disease, it is desirable to open the inguinal canal and tie the cord as near the internal abdominal ring as possible. Vesicul^ Seminales The Seminal Vesicles are two lobulated membranous pouches, placed between the base of the bladder and the rectum, serving as reservoirs for the semen, and secreting a fluid to be added to the secretion of the testicles. Each sac is somewhat pyramidal in form, the broad end being directed backwards, and the narrow end forwards towards the prostate. They measure about two and a half inches in length, about five lines in breadth, and two or three lines in thickness. They vary, however, in size, not only in different individuals, but also in the same individual on the two sides. Their u^jper surface is in contact with the base of the bladder, extending from near the termination of the ureters to the base of the prostate gland. Their under surface rests upon the rectum, from which they are separated by the recto-vesical fascia. Their ^os^er/or extremities diverge from each other. Theiv anterior extremities are pointed, and converge towards the base of the prostate gland, where each joins with the corresponding vas deferens to form the ejaculatory duct. Along the inner margin of each vesicula runs the enlarged and convoluted vas deferens. The inner border of the vesiculae, and the corresponding vas deferens, form the lateral boundaries of a triangular space, limited behind by the recto-vesical peritoneal Fig. 6io.—Base of the bladder, with the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales. Bight ejaculatory duct-DESCENT OF THE TESTES 1029 fold; the portion of the bladder included in this space rests on the rectum, and corresponds with the trigonum vesicae in its interior. Each vesicula consists of a single tube, coiled upon itself, and giving off several irregular csecal diverticula: the separate coils, as well as the diverticula, being connected together by fibrous tissue. When uncoiled, this tube is about the diameter of a quill, and varies in length from four to six inches; it terminates posteriorly in a cul-de-sac ; its anterior extremity becomes constricted into a narrow straight duct, which joins on its inner side with the corresponding vas deferens, and forms the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts, two in number, one on each side, are formed by the junction of the ducts of the vesicula seminales with the vasa deferentia. Each duct is about three.-quarters of an inch in length ; it commences at the base of the prostate, and runs forwards and upwards in a canal in its substance, and along the side of the sinus pocularis, to terminate by a separate slit-like orifice close to or just within the margins of the sinus. The ducts diminish in size, and converge towards their termination. Structure.—The vesiculge seminales are composed of three coats : an external or fihro-cellular ; a middle or muscular coat, which is thinner than in the vas deferens : the muscular fibres are arranged in three layers, consisting of an inner and outer longitudinal stratum and an intermediate layer of circular fibres ; and an internal or mucous coat, which is pale, of a whitish-brown colour, and presents a delicate reticular structure, like that seen in the gall-bladder, but the meshes are finer. The epithelium is columnar. The coats of the ejaculatory ducts are extremely thin. They are : an outer fibrous layer, which is almost entirely lost after their entrance into the prostate ; a layer of muscular fibres, consisting of an outer thin circular and an inner longi- tudinal layer, and the mucous membrane forming the only constituents of the tubes. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the vesiculae seminales are derived from the middle and inferior vesical and middle haemorrhoidal. The veins and lymphatics accompany the arteries. The nerves are derived from the pelvic plexus. Surgical Anatomy.—The vesiculae seminales are often the seat of an extension of the disease in cases of tuberculous disease of the testicle, and should always be examined from the rectum before coming to a decision with regard to castration in this affection. Descent of the Testes I The testes, at an early period of foetal life, are placed at the back part of the abdominal cavity, behind the peritoneum ; in front, and a little below the kidneys. The anterior surface and sides are invested by peritoneum. At about the third month of intra-uterine life a peculiar structure, the gubernaculum testis, makes its appearance. This structure is at first a slender band which extends from the situation of the internal ring, to the epididymis and body of the testicle, and is then continued upwards in front of the kidney towards the Diaphragm. As development advances, the peritoneum covering the testicle encloses it and forms a mesentery, the mesorchium, which also encloses the gubernaculum and forms two folds, one above the testicle, and the other below it. The one above the testicle is the plica vascularis, and contains ultimately the spermatic vessels ; the one below, the plica gubernatrix, contains the lower part of the gubernaculum, which has now grown into a thick cord ; it terminates below at the internal ring in a sort of tube, the processus vaginalis, which protrudes itself down the inguinal canal. The lower part of the gubernaculum by the fifth month has become a thick cord, whilst the upper part has disappeared. The lower part can now be seen to consist of a central core of unstriped muscle-fibre, and outside this of a firm layer of striped elements connected, behind the peritoneum, with the abdominal wall. Later on, about the sixth month, the lower end of the gubernaculum can be traced into the inguinal canal, extending to the pubes, and, at a later period, to the bottom of the scrotum.lOtO MALE OKGANS OF GENERATION The fold of peritoneum, constituting the processus vaginalis, projects itself downwards into the inguinal canal, forming a gradually elongating depression or cul-de-sac, which eventually reaches the bottom of the scrotum, and into this the testicle is drawn by the growth of the body of the foetus, for the gubernaculum does not grow commensurately with the growth of other parts, and therefore the testicle, being attached by the gubernaculum to the bottom of the scrotum, is prevented from rising as the body grows, and is drawn first into the inguinal canal and eventually into the scrotum. By the eighth month, the testicle has reached the scrotum, preceded by the lengthened pouch of peritoneum, the processus vaginalis, which communicates by its upper extremity with the peritoneal cavity. Just before birth the upper part of the pouch usually becomes closed, and this obliteration extends gradually downwards to within a short distance of the testis. The process of peritoneum surrounding the testis which is now entirely cut off from the general peritoneal cavit}" constitutes the tunica vaginalis.* In the female, a small cord, corresponding to the gubernaculum in the male, descends to the inguinal region, and ultimately forms the round ligament of the uterus. A pouch of peritoneum accompanies it along the inguinal canal, analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male : it is called the canal of Nuck. SiLvgical Anatomy.—Abnormalities in the formation and in the descent of the testicle may occur. The testicle may fail to be developed; or the testicle may be fully developed, and the vas deferens may be undeveloped in whole or part; or again, both testicle and vas deferens may be fully develoj^ed, but the duct may not become connected to the gland. The testicle may fail in its descent, or it may descend into some abnormal position. Thus it may be retained in the position where it was primarily developed, below the kidney; or it may descend to the internal abdominal ring, but fail to pass through this opening; it may be retained in the inguinal canal, which is perhaps the most common position ; or it may pass through the external abdominal ring and remain just outside it, failing to pass to the bottom of the scrotum. On the other hand, it may get into some abnormal position: it may pass the scrotum and reach the perinseum, or it may fail to enter the inguinal canal, and may find its way through the femoral ring into the crural canal, and present itself on the thigh at the saphenous opening. There is still a third class of cases of abnormality of the testicle, where the organ has descended in due course into the scrotum, but is malplaced. The most common form of this is where the testicle is inverted ; that is to say, the organ is rotated so that the epididymis is connected to the front of the scrotum, and the body, surrounded by the tunica vaginalis, is directed backwards. In these cases the vas deferens is to be felt in the front of the cord. The condition is of importance in connection with hydrocele and h«matocele, and the position of the testicle should always be carefully ascertained before performing any operation for these affections. Again, more rarely, the testicle may be reversed. This is a condition in which the top of the testicle, indicated by the globus major of the epididymis, is at the bottom of the scrotum, and the vas deferens comes off from the summit of the organ. * The obliteration of the process of peritoneum which accompanies the cord, and is hence called the funicular j^rocess, is often incomplete. See section on Inguinal Hernia.FEMALE ORGANS OE GENERATION EXTERNAL ORGANS fT'^HE External Organs of Generation in the Female are : tjie mons Veneris ; the JL labia majora and minora, the clitoris, the meatus urinarius, and the orifice of the vagina. The term ' vulva ' or ' pudendum,' as generally applied, includes all these parts. Fig. 611.—The vulva. External female organs of generation. The Mons Veneris is the rounded eminence in front of the pubic symphysis, formed by a collection of fatty tissue beneath the integument. It surmounts the vulva, and becomes covered with hair at the time of puberty. The Labia Majora are two prominent longitudinal cutaneous folds, extendmgFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION I032 downwards from the mons Veneris to the anterior boundary of the perinasum, and enclosing the common mdno-sexual opening. Each labium is formed, externally, of integument covered with hair ; internally, of mucous membrane,* which is continuous with the genito-urinary mucous tract; and between the two, of a considerable quantity of areolar tissue, fat, and a tissue resembling the dartos of the scrotum, besides vessels, nerves, and glands. The labia are thicker in front, where they form by their meeting the anterior commissure. Posteriorly they are not really joined, but appear to become lost in the neighbouring integument, terminating close to, and nearly parallel with each other. Together with the connectiug skin between them, they form the posterior commissure, or posterior boundary of the vulval orifice. The interval between the posterior commissure and the anus, about an inch to an inch and a quarter in length, constitutes the perinfeum. The fourchette is the anterior edge of the perineum, and between it Fig. 612.—Vertical median section of the female pelvis. 1 and the hymen is a depression, the fossa navicularis. The labia correspond to the scrotum in the male. The Labia Minora, or Nymphse, are two small cutaneous folds, situated within the labia majora, and extending from the clitoris obliquely downwards, outwards, and backwards for about an inch and a half on each side of the orifice of the vagina, between which and the labia majora they are lost. Anteriorly, the two labia minora meet, and form the frcBimm of the clitoris. The prepuce of the clitoris, passing backwards on each side, is inserted, as it were, into the labia, but is not actually a part of them. The nymphse are really modified skin. Their internal surfaces have numerous sebaceous follicles. * The term mucous membrane is used here in its broad sense to denote an internal surface kept continuously moist by secretion, and communicating directly or indirectly with the external air.1033 THE BLADDER The Clitoris is an erectile structure, analogous to the corpora cavernosa of the penis. It is situated beneath the anterior commissure, partially hidden between the anterior extremities of the labia minora. It is connected to the rami of the os pubis and ischium on each side by a crus ; the body is short and concealed beneath the labia ; the free extremity, or glans cUtoridis, is a small rounded tubercle, consisting of spongy erectile tissue, and highly sensitive. It is provided, like the penis, with a suspensory ligament, and with two small muscles, the Erectores clitoridis, which are inserted into the crura of the clitoris. The clitoris consists of two corpora cavernosa, composed of erectile tissue enclosed in a dense layer of fibrous membrane, united together along their inner surfaces by an incomplete fibrous pectiniform septum. Between the clitoris and the entrance of the vagina is a triangular smooth surface, bounded on each side by the nymphse ; this is the vestibule. The orifice of the urethra (meatus urinarius) is situated at the back part of the vestibule, about an inch below the clitoris, and near the margin of the vagina, surrounded by a prominent elevation of the mucous membrane. Below the meatus urinarius is the orifice of the vagina, more or less closed in the virgin by a membranous fold, the hymen. The Hymen is a membranous fold which closes to a greater or less extent the opening of the vagina. It varies much in shape. Its commonest form is that of a ring, generally broadest posteriorly : sometimes it is represented by a semilunar fold, with its concave margin turned towards the pubes. A complete septum stretched across the lower part of the vaginal orifice is called ' imperforate hymen.' Occasionally it is cribriform, or its free margin forms a membranous fringe, or it may be entirely absent. It may persist after copulation, so that it cannot be considered as a test of virginity. After parturition, the small rounded elevations known as the carunculcB myrtiformes are found as the remains of the hymen. Grlands of Bartholin.—On each side of the commencement of the vagina, and behind the hymen, is a round or oblong body, of a reddish-yellow colour, and of the size of a horse-bean, analogous to Cowper's gland in the male. It is called the gland of Bartholin. Each gland opens by means of a long single duct, on each side, external to the hymen. Bulbi vestibnli.—Extending from the clitoris, along either side of the vestibule, and lying a little behind the nymphse, are two large oblong masses, about an inch in length, consisting of a plexus of veins, enclosed in a thin layer of fibrous membrane. These bodies are narrow in front, rounded below, and are connected with the crura of the clitoris and rami of the pubes : they are termed by Kobelt the hulhi vestibuli ; and he considers them analogous to the bulb of the corpus spongiosum in the male. Immediately in front of these bodies is a smaller venous plexus, continuous with the bulbi vestibuli behind and the glans clitoridis in front: it is called by Kobelt the _p<xrs intermedia, and is considered by him as analogous to that part of the body of the corpus spongiosum which immediately succeeds the bulb. Relations of the Bladder The Bladder is situated at the anterior part of the pelvis. It is in relation, in front, with the symphysis pubis ; behind, with the utero-vesical pouch of peritoneum which separates it from the body of the uterus ; its base lies in contact w4th the connective tissue in front of the cervix and upper part of the vagina. Laterally, is the recto-vesical fascia. The bladder is said by some anatomists to be larger in the female than in the male. At any rate it does not rise above the symphysis pubis till more distended than in the male, but this is perhaps owing to the more capacious pelvis rather than to its being of actually larger size.FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION I034 The Ueethea The Urethra is a narrow membranous canal, about an inch and a half in length, extending- from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It is placed beneath the symphysis pubis, embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina ; and its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards, its course being slightly curved, the concavity directed forwards and upwards. Its diameter when undilated is about a quarter of an inch. The urethra perforates the triangular ligament, precisely as in the male. Structure.—The urethra consists of three coats : muscular, erectile, and mucous. The muscular coat is continuous with that of the bladder ; it extends the whole length of the tube, and consists of a circular stratum of muscular fibres. In addition to this, between the two layers of the triangular ligament, the female urethra is surrounded by the Compressor urethrae, as in the male. A thin layer of spongy erectile tissue, containing a plexus of large veins, inter- mixed with bundles of unstriped muscular fibre, lies immediately beneath the mucous coat. The 7nucous coat is pale, continuous externally with that of the vulva, and internally with that of the bladder. It is thrown into longitudinal folds, one of which, placed along the floor of the canal, resembles the verumontanum in the male urethra. It is lined by laminated epithelium, which becomes transitional near the bladder. Its external orifice is surrounded by a few mucous follicles. The urethra, from not being surrounded by dense resisting structures, as in the male, admits of considerable dilatation, which enables the surgeon to remove with considerable facility calculi, or other foreign bodies, from the cavity of the bladder. The Rectum The Rectum is more capacious and less curved in the female than in the male. The first portion extends from the left sacro-iliac symphysis to the middle of the sacrum.- Its connections are similar to those in the male. The second portion extends to the tip of the coccyx. It is covered in front by the peritoneum for a short distance, at its upper part: it is in relation with the posterior wall of the vagina. The third portion curves backwards from the vagina to the anus, leaving a space which corresponds on the surface of the body to the perinseum. Its extremity is surrounded by the Sphincter muscles, and its sides are supported by the Levatores ani. INTERNAL ORGANS The Internal Organs of Generation are : the vagina, the uterus and its append- ages, the Fallopian tubes, the ovaries and their ligaments, and the round ligaments. The Vagina extends from the vulva to the uterus. It is situated in the cavity of the pelvis, behind the bladder, and in front of the rectum. Its direction is curved upwards and backwards, at first in the line of the outlet, and afterwards in that of the axis of the cavity of the pelvis. Its walls are ordinarily in contact, and its usual shape on transverse section is that of an H, the transverse limb being slightly curved forwards or backwards, whilst the lateral limbs are somewhat convex towards the median, line. Its length is about two inches along its anterior wall, and two and three-quarter inches along its posterior wall. It is constricted at its commencement, and becomes dilated medially, and narrowed near its uterine extremity ; it surrounds the vaginal portion of the cervix uteri, a short distance from the os, its attachment extending higher up on the posterior than on the anterior wall of the uterus. Relations.—Its anterior surface is in relation with the base of the bladder, and with the urethra. Its posterior surface is connected for the lower three-fourths of its extent to the anterior wall of the rectum, the upper fifth being separated fromTHE UTEEUS 1035 that tube by the recto-vaginal fold of peritoneum, which forms a cul-de-sac between the vagina and rectum. Its sides give attachment superiorly to the broad ligaments, and inferiorly to the Levatores ani muscles and recto-vesical fascia. Structure.—The vagina consists of an internal mucous lining, of a muscular coat, and between the two of a layer of erectile tissue. The mucous memhrane * is continuous above with that lining the uterus. Its inner surface presents, along the anterior and posterior walls, a longitudinal ridge or raphe, called the columns of the vagina, and numerous transverse ridges or rugse, extending outwards from the raphe on either side. These rugae are divided by furrows of variable depth, giving to the mucous membrane the appearance of being studded over with conical projections or papillae ; they are most numerous near the orifice of the vagina, especially in females before parturition. The epithelium covering the mucous membrane is of the squamous variety. The submucous tissue is very loose, and contains numerous large veins, which by their anastomoses form a plexus, together with smooth muscular fibres derived from the muscular coat; it is regarded by Gussenbauer as an erectile tissue. It contains a number of mucous crypts, but no true glands. The muscular coat consists of two layers : an external longitudinal, which is far the stronger, and an internal circular layer. The longitudinal fibres are continuous with the superficial muscular fibres of the uterus. The strongest fasciculi are those attached to the recto-vesical fascia on each side. The two layers are not distinctly separable from each other, but are connected by oblique decus- sating fasciculi, which pass from the one layer to the other. In addition to this, the vagina at its lower end is surrounded by a band of striped muscular fibres, the sphincter vagince (see page 442). External to the muscular coat is a layer of connective tissue, containing a large plexus of blood-vessels. The erectile tissue consists of a layer of loose connective tissue, situated between the mucous membrane and the muscular coat; embedded in it is a plexus of large veins, and numerous bundles of unstriped muscular fibres, derived from the circular muscular layer. The arrangement of the veins is similar to that found in other erectile tissues. The Uterus The Uterus is the organ of gestation, receiving the fecundated ovum in its cavity, retaining and supporting it during the development of the foetus, and becoming the principal agent in its expulsion at the time of parturition. In the virgin state it is pear-sha,ped, flattened from before backwards, and situated in the cavity of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum ; it is retained in its position by the round and broad ligaments on each side, and projects into the upper end of the vagina below. Its upper end, or base, is directed upwards and forwards ; its lower end, or apex, downwards and backwards, in the line of the axis of the inlet of the pelvis. It therefore forms an angle with the vagina, since the direction of the vagina corresponds to the axis of the cavity and outlet of the pelvis. The uterus measures about three inches in length, two in breadth at its upper part, and nearly an inch in thickness, and it weighs from an ounce to an ounce and a half. It consists of two parts : (i) the body, with its upper broad extremity, the f undus ; and (2) the cervix, or neck, which is partly above the vagina, and partly in the vagina. The fundus is placed on a line below the level of the brim of the pelvis, being directed forwards behind the upper portion of the anterior pelvic wall. The division between the body and cervix is indicated externally by a slight con- striction, and by the reflection of the peritoneum from the anterior surface of the uterus on to the bladder, and internally by a narrowing of the canal, called the internal os. The body gradually narrows from the fundus to the neck. Its anterior surface is flattened, covered by peritoneum in the upper three-fourths of its extent, and separated * See foot-note page 1032.1036 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION from the bladder by the utero-vesical pouch. Its posterior surface is convex transversely, covered by peritoneum throughout, and separated from the rectum by some convolutions of the intestine. Its lateral ma,rgins are concave, and give attachment to the Fallopian tube above, the round ligament below and in front of this, and the ligament of the ovary behind and between both of these structures. The cervix is the lower constricted segment of the uterus ; around its circum- ference is attached the upper end of the vagina, which extends upwards a greater distance behind than in front. The supravaginal portion is not covered by peritoneum in front; a pad of cellular tissue is interposed between it and the bladder. Behind, the peritoneum is extended over it. The vaginal portion is the rounded lower end projecting into the vagina. On its surface is a small aperture, the os uteri, generally circular in Fig. 613.—Douglas's pouch. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Royal Colle<ife of Surgeons.) £xt. duzc art. shape, but sometimes oval, or almost linear. The margin of the opening is, in the absence of past parturition or disease, quite smooth. Ligaments.—The ligaments of the uterus are eight in number : one anterior; one posterior ; two lateral or broad; two sacro-uterine—all these being formed of peritoneum ; and, lastly, two round ligaments. The anterior ligament (vesico-uterine) is reflected on to the bladder from the front of the uterus, at the junction of the supravaginal cervix and body. The posterior ligament (recto-uterine) passes from the posterior wall of the uterus over the upper fifth of the vagina, and thence on to the rectum and sacrum. It thus forms a pouch called Douglas's pouch (fig. 613), the boundaries of which are, in front, the posterior wall of the uterus, the supravaginal cervix, and the upper fifth of the vagina ; behind, the rectum and sacrum ; above, the small intestine ; and, laterally, the sacro-uterine ligaments.1037 THE UTEEUS The tioo lateral or hroacl ligaments pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis, forming a septum across the pelvis, which divides that cavity into two portions. In the anterior part are contained the bladder, urethra, and vagina ; in the posterior part, the rectum. Between the two layers of each broad ligament are contained : (i) the Fallopian tubes superiorly ; (2) the round ligament; (3) the ovary and its ligament; (4) the parovarium, or organ of Eosenmiiller ; (5) connective tissue; and (6) unstriped muscular fibre. Between the fimbriated extremity of the tube and the lower attachment of the broad ligament is a concave rounded margin called the infunclihulo-pelvic ligament (fig. 616). The sacro-uterine ligaments pass from the second and third bones of the sacrum, downwards and forwards, to be attached one on each side of the uterus at the junction of the supravaginal cervix and the body, this point corresponding internally to the position of the os internum. The cavity of the uterus is small in comparison with the size of the organ : Fig. 614.—Side view of the female pelvic organs. (From a preparation in the Museum of the lioyal College of Snri^eons.) that portion of the cavity which corresponds to the body is triangular, flattened from before backwards, so that its walls are closely approximated, and having its base directed upwards towards the fundus. At each superior angle is a funnel- shaped cavity, which constitutes the remains of the division of the body of the uterus into two cornua ; and at the bottom of each cavity is the minute orifice of the Fallopian tube. At the inferior angle of the uterine cavity is a small constricted opening, the internal orifice (ostium internum), which leads into the cavity of the cervix. The cavity of the cervix is somewhat fusiform, flattened from before backwards, broader at the middle than at either extremity, and communicates, below, with the vagina. The wall of the canal presents, anteriorly and posteriorly, a longitudinal column, from which proceed a number of small oblique columns, giving the appearance of branches from the stem of a tree ; and hence the name arhor vitcBFEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION uterina applied to it. These folds usually become very indistinct after the first labour. Structure.—The uterus is composed of three coats : an external serous coat, a middle or muscular, and an internal mucous coat. The serous coat is derived from the peritoneum ; it invests the fundus and the whole of the posterior surface of the body of the uterus; but only the upper three- fourths of its anterior surface. In the lower fourth of the posterior surface the peritoneum, though covering the uterus, is not closely connected with it, being separated from it by a layer of loose cellular tissue and some large veins. The ynuscular coat forms the chief bulk of the substance of the uterus. In the unimpregnated state it is dense, firm, of a greyish colour, and cuts almost like cartilage. It is thick opposite the middle of the body and fundus, and thin at the orifices of the Fallopian tubes. It consists of bundles of unstriped muscular fibres, disposed in layers, intermixed with areolar tissue, blood-vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. In the impregnated state the muscular tissue becomes more prominently developed, and is disposed in three layers—external, middle, and internal. The external layer is placed beneath the peritoneum, disposed as a thin plane on the anterior and posterior surfaces. It consists of fibres, which pass transversely across the fundus, and, converging at each superior angle of the uterus, are continued on the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, the ligament of the ovary : some passing at each side into the broad ligament, and others running backwards from the cervix into the recto-uterine hgaments. The middle layer of fibres, which is thickest, presents no regularity in its arrangement, being disposed longitudinally, obliquely, and transversely. It contains most blood-vessels. The internal or deep layer consists of circular fibres arranged in the form of two hollow cones, the apices of which surround the orifices of the Fallopian tubes, their bases intermingling with one another on the middle of the body of the uterus. At the internal os these circular fibres form a distinct sphincter. The mucous membrane is thin, smooth, and closely adherent to the subjacent tissue. It is continuous, through the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes, with the peritoneum ; and, through the os uteri, with the lining of the vagina. In the body of the uterus it is smooth, soft, of a pale red colour, lined by columnar ciliated epithelium, and presents, when \dewed with a lens, the orifices of numerous tubular follicles arranged perpendicularly to the surface. It is unprovided with any submucosa, but is intimately connected with the innermost layer of the muscular coat, which by some anatomists is regarded as the muscularis mucosae. In structure it differs from ordinary mucous membrane, consisting of an embryonic nucleated and highly cellular form of connective tissue in which run numerous large lymphatics. In it are the tube-like uterine glands, which are of small size in the unimpregnated uterus, but shortly after impregnation become enlarged, elongated, presenting a contorted or waved appearance towards their closed extremities, which reaches into the muscularis, and may be single or bifid. They consist of a delicate membrane, lined by an epithelium, which becomes ciliated towards the orifices. In the impregnated uterus the epithelium loses its ciliated character, is thicker and tougher, and is provided with a submucous layer of areolar tissue. In the cervix the mucous membrane is sharply differentiated from that of the uterine cavity. It is thrown into numerous transverse folds, which are arranged along an anterior and posterior longitudinal raphe, presenting an appearance which has received the name of arbor vitce. In the upper two-thirds of the canal, the mucous membrane is provided with numerous, deep glandular follicles, which secrete a clear viscid alkaline mucus ; and in addition, extending through the whole length of the canal, are a variable number of little cysts, presumably follicles, which have become occluded and distended with retained secretion. They are called the ovula Nabothi. The mucous membrane covering the lower half of the cervical canal presents numerous papillae. The epithelium ofTHE UTERUS 1039 the upper two-thirds is cyHndrical and ciliated, but below this it loses its cilia, and gradually changes to squamous epithelium close to the external os. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the uterus are the uterine, from the internal iliac; and the ovarian, from the aorta. They are remarkable for their tortuous course in the substance of the organ, and for their frequent anastomoses. The termination of the ovarian artery meets the termination of the uterine artery, and forms an anastomotic trunk from which branches are given off to supply the uterus, their disposition being, as shown by John Wilhams, circular. The veins are of large size, and correspond with the arteries. In the impregnated uterus these vessels are termed the uterine sinuses, consisting of the Hning membrane of the veins adhering to the walls of the canal channelled through the substance of the uterus. They terminate in the uterine plexuses. The lymjjhatics of the body terminate in the lumbar glands, those of the cervix in the pelvic glands. The nerves^ are derived from the inferior hypogastric and ovarian plexuses, and from the third and fourth sacral nerves. Fig. 615.—The arteries of the internal organs of o^eneration of the female, seen from behind. (After Hyrtl.) The form, size, and situation of the uterus vary at different periods of life and under different circumstances. In the foetus the uterus is contained in the abdominal cavity, projecting bej'ond the brim of the pelvis. The cervix is considerably larger than the body. At puberty the uterus is pyriform in shape, and weighs from eight to ten drachms, it has descended into the pelvis, the fundus being just below the level of the brim of this cavity. The arbor vitae is distinct, and extends to the upper part of the cavity of the origan. During menstruation the organ is enlarged, and more vascular, its surfaces rounder; the OS externum is rounded, its labia swollen, a,nd the lining membrane of the body thickened, softer, and of a darker colour. According to J. Williams, at each recurrence of menstruation, a molecular disintegration of the mucous membrane takes place, which leads to its complete removal, only the bases of the glands embedded in the muscle being left. At the cessation of menstruation, by a proliferation of the remaining structures a fresh mucous membrane is formed. During preg^iancy the uterus becomes enormously enlarged, and in the ninth month reaches the epigastric region. The increase in size is partly due to growth of pre-existing muscle, and partly to development of new fibres. After parturition the uterus nearly regains its usual size, weighing about an ounceFEMALE OKGANS OF GENERATION 1040 and a half; but its cavity is larger than in the virgin state; the external orifice is more marked ; its edges present a fissured surface; its vessels are tortuous ; and its muscular layers are more defined. In old age the uterus becomes atrophied, and paler and denser in texture; a more distinct constriction separates the body and cervix. The ostium internum and, occasionally, the vaginal orifice often become obliterated, and its labia almost entirely disappear. Appendages of the Uterus The appendages of the uterus are the Fallopian tubes, the ovaries and their ligaments, and the round ligaments. They are placed in the following order : in front is the round ligament ; the Fallopian tube occupies the upper margin of the broad ligament ; the ovary and its ligament are behind and below both. The Fallopian Tubes, or Oviducts, convey the ova from the ovaries to the cavity of the uterus. They are two in number, one on each side, situated in the upper margin of the broad ligament, extending from each superior angle of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis. Each tube is about four inches in length ; and is described as consisting of three portions : (i) the isthmus, or inner constricted half; (2) the ampulla, or outer dilated portion, which curves over the ovary ; and (3) the Fig. 616.—Uterine appendages, seen from behind. (Henle.) Fimlria ovarica - infundihulum with its ostium abdominals, surrounded by fimbri^e, one of which is attached to the ovary, the fimbria ovarica. The general direction of the Fallopian tube is outwards, backwards, and downwards. The uterine opening is minute, and will only admit a fine bristle ; the abdominal opening is comparatively much larger. In connection with the fimbriae of the Fallopian tube, or with the broad ligament close to them, there is frequently one or more small vesicles, floating on a long stalk of peritoneum. These are termed the hydatids of Morgagni, and are probably the remains of the terminal sacs of the Miillerian ducts. Structure.—The Fallopian tube consists of three coats : serous, muscular, and mucous. The external or serous coat is peritoneal. The middle or muscular coat consists of an external longitudinal and an internal circular layer of muscular fibres continuous with those of the uterus. The internal or mucous coat is continuous with the mucous lining of the uterus, and, at the free extremity of the tube, with the peritoneum. It is thrown into longitudinal folds, which in the outer, larger part of the tube, or ampulla, are much more extensive than in the narrow canal of the isthmus. The lining epithelium is cohnnnar cihated. This form of epithelium is also found on the inner surface of the fimbria ; while on the outer or serous surfaces of these processes the epithelium gradually merges into the endothelium of the peritoneum.THE OVARIES 1041 The Ovaries {testes miiUebres, Galen) are analogous to the testes in the male. They are oval-shaped bodies, of an elongated form, flattened from above down- wards, situated one on each side of the uterus, in the posterior part of the broad ligament behind and below the Fallopian tubes. Each ovary is connected, by its anterior straight margin, to the broad ligaments; by its inner extremity, to the uterus by a proper ligament, the ligament of the ovary ; and by its outer end, to the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube by the ovarian fimbria; its superior and inferior surfaces and posterior convex border are free. The ovaries are- of a greyish-pink colour, and present either a smooth or puckered uneven surface. They are each about an inch and a half in length, three-quarters of an inch in width, and about a third of an inch thick ; and weigh from one to two drachms. The exact position of the ovary has been the subject of considerable difference of opinion, and writers differ much as to what is to be regarded as the normal posi- tion. The fact appears to be that it is differently placed in different individuals. Hasse has described it as being situated with its long axis transverse, or almost Fig. 617.—The uterus and its appendages. Posterior view. The parts have been some- what displaced from their proper position in the preparation of the specimen; thus the right ovary has been raised above the Fallopian tube, and the fimbriated extremities of the tubes have been turned upwards and outwards. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) transverse, to the pelvic cavity. Schultze, on the other hand, believes that its long axis is antero-posterior. Kolliker asserts that the truth lies between these two views, and that the ovary is placed obliquely in the pelvis, its long axis lying parallel to the external iliac vessels, with its surface directed inwards and outwards, and its convex free border upwards. His has made some important observations on this subject, and his views are largely accepted. He teaches that the uterus rarely lies symmetrically in the middle of the pelvic cavity, but is generally inclined to one or other side, most frequently to the left, in the proportion of three to two. The position of the two ovaries varies according to the inclination of the uterus. When the uterus is inclined to the left, the ovary of this side lies with its long axis vertical and with one side closely applied to the outer wall of the pelvis ; while the ovary of the opposite side, being dragged upon by the inclination of the uterus, lies obliquely, its outer extremity being retained in close apposition to the side of the pelvis by the infundibulo-pelvic ligament (page 1037). When, on the other hand, the uterus is inclined to the right, the position of the two ovaries is exactly reversed, the right being vertical and the left oblique. In whichever position the ovary is placed, the Fallopian tube forms a loop around it, the uterine half ascending obliquely over it, and the outer half, including the dilated extremity, descending and bulging freely behind it. From this extremity the fimbriae pass upwards on to the ovary and closely embrace it. Structure.—The ovary consists of a number of Graafian vesicles, embedded in 3X1042 FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION the meshes of a stroma or framework, and invested by a serous covering derived from the peritoneum. Serous Covering.—Though the investing membrane of the ovary is derived from the peritoneum, it differs essentially from that structure, inasmuch as its epithelium consists of a single layer of columnar cells, instead of the flattened endothelial cells, of other parts of the membrane ; this has been termed the germinal epWielium of Waldeyer, and gives to the surface of the ovary a dull grey aspect instead of the shining smoothness of serous membranes generally. Stroma.—The stroma is a peculiar soft tissue, abundantly supplied with blood- vessels, consisting for the most part of spindle-shaped cells, with a small amount of ordinary connective tissue. These cells have been regarded by some anatomists as unstriped muscle cells, which, indeed, they most resemble (His); by others as connective-tissue cells (Waldeyer, Henle, and Kolliker). On the surface of the organ this tissue is much condensed, and forms a layer composed of short connective-tissue fibres, with fusiform cells between them. This was formerly regarded as a distinct fibrous covering, and was termed the tunica alhuginea, but is nothing more than a condensed layer of the stroma of the ovary. Graafian Vesicles.—Upon making a section of an ovary, numerous round transparent vesicles of various sizes are to be seen ; they are the Graafian vesicles, the ovisacs containing the ova. Immediately beneath the superficial covering is a layer of stroma, in which are a large number of minute vesicles, of uniform size, about yJ^7j of an inch in diameter. These are the Graafian vesicles in their earliest condition, and the layer where they are found has been termed the cortical layer. They are especially numerous in the ovary of the young child. After puberty, and during the whole Fig. 618.—Section of the ovary. (After Scliron.) of the child-bearing period, 5 large and mature, or almost mature, Graafian vesicles are also found in the cortical layer in small numbers, and also ' corpora lutea,' the remains of Fig. 619.—Section of the Graafian vesicle.

Beneath this superficial stratum, other large and more mature Graafian vesicles are found embedded in the ovarian stroma. These increase in size as they recede from the surface towards a highly vascular stroma in the centre of the organ, termed the medullary substance {zona vasculosa, Waldeyer). This stroma forms the tissue of the hilum by which the ovary is attached, and through which the blood-vessels enter; it does not contain any Graafian vesicles. The Graafian vesicles consist of an external fibro-vascular coat, connected with the surrounding stroma of the ovary by a network of blood-vessels ; and an internal coat, named ovicajjsule, which is lined by a layer of nucleated cells, called the membrana granulosa. The fluid contained in the interior of the vesicles is transparent and albuminous, and in it is suspended the ovum. In that part of the mature Graafian vesicle which is nearest the surface of the ovary, the cells of the membrana granulosa are collected into a mass which projects into the cavityTHE ROUND LIGAMENTS 1043 of the vesicle. This is termed the clisnis proligerus, and in this the ovum is embedded.* The ova are formed from the germ-epithehum on the surface of the ovary: the cells become enlarged and involuted, forming Httle depressions on the surface of the ovary. As they sink deeper into the tissue they become enclosed by the out- growth of processes from the stroma of the ovary, and, becoming surrounded, their connection with the surface is cut off, and the germ-epitheUum forming the involution is contained in a cavity, the future Graafian folhcle. The germ-cell or cells now form the ovum ; the cell-wall forms the vitelline membrane ; the nucleus, the germinal area ; and a nucleolus, which soon appears, the germinal spot. A clear homogeneous protoplasm is formed Avithin the cell, constituting the yelk, and thus the primordial ovum is developed. According to Dr. Foulis, the cells of the membrana granulosa are formed out of the nuclei of the fibro-cellular stroma of the ovary .t The development and maturation of the Graafian vesicles and ova continue uninterruptedly from puberty to the end of the fruitful period of woman's life, while their formation commences before birth. Before puberty the ovaries are small, the Graafian vesicles contained in them are disposed in a comparatively bhick layer in the cortical substance ; here they present the appearance of a large number of minute closed vesicles, constituting the early condition of the Graafian vesicle ; many, however, never attain full development, but shrink and disappear, their ova being incapable of impregnation. At puberty the ovaries enlarge, are more vascular, the Graafian vesicles are developed in greater abundance, and their ova are capable of fecundation. Discharge of the Ovum.—The Graafian vesicles, after gradually approaching the surface of the ovary, burst: the ovum and fluid contents of the vesicles are liberated, and escape on the exterior of the ovary, passing thence into the Fallopian tube.+ In the foetus, the ovaries are situated, like the testes, in the lumbar region, near the kidneys. They may be distinguished from those bodies at an early period by their elongated and flattened form, and by their position, which is at first oblique and then nearly transverse. They gradually descend into the pelvis. Lying above the ovary in the broad ligament between it and the Fallopian tube is the organ of BosenmilUer, called also the parovarium or epoophoron. This is the remnant of a foetal structure, the development of which has been described at a former page (page 108). In the adult it consists of a few closed convoluted tubes, lined with epithelium, some of them atrophied, and one, usually distinguishable from the rest, ends in a bulbous or hydatid swelling. The parovarium is con- nected at its uterine extremity with the remains of the Wolffian duct—the duct of Gartner. The Ligament of the ovary is a rounded cord, which extends from each superior angle of the uterus to the inner extremity of the ovary ; it consists of fibrous tissue and a few muscular fibres derived from the uterus. The Round Ligaments are two rounded cords between four and five inches in length, situated between the layers of the broad ligament in front of and below the Fallopian tube. Commencing on each side at the superior angle of the uterus, this ligament passes forwards, upwards, and outwards through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal to the labia majora, in which it becomes lost. The round ligament consists principally of muscular tissue, prolonged from the uterus ; also of some fibrous and areolar tissue, besides blood-vessels and nerves, enclosed in a duplicature of peritoneum, which, in the foetus, is prolonged in the form of a tubular process for a short distance into the inguinal canal. This process is called the canal of Nuch. It is generally obliterated in the adult, but sometimes remains * For a description of the ovum, see page 68. + Proceedings of the Boyal Society of Edinburgh, April 1875. X This is effected either by apphcation of the tube to the ovary, or by a curling upwards of the fimbriated extremity, so that the ovum is caught as it falls. 3x2FEMALE OEGANS OF GENEEATION I044 pervious even in advanced life. It is analogous to the peritoneal pouch which accompanies the descent of the testis. Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes are the ovarian from the aorta. They enter the attached border, or hilum, of the ovary. The veins follow the course of the arteries ; they form a plexus near the ovary, the ya.mimiiform plexus. The nerves are derived from the inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexus, and from the ovarian plexus, the Fallopian tube receiving a branch from one of the uterine nerves. Mammaey Glands The mammae, or breasts, are accessory glands of the generative system, which secrete the milk. They exist in the male as well as in the female; but in the former only in the rudimentary state, unless their growth is excited by peculiar circumstances. In the female they are two large hemispherical eminences situated Fig. 620.—Dissection of the lower half of the female breast during the period of lactation. (From Luschka.) towards the lateral aspect of the pectoral region, corresponding to the intervals between the third and sixth or seventh ribs, and extending from the side of the sternum to the axilla. Their weight and dimensions differ at different periods of life, and in different individuals. Before puberty they are of small size, but enlarge as the generative organs become more completely developed. They increase during pregnancy, and especially after delivery, and become atrophied in old age. The left mamma is generally a little larger than the right. Their base is nearly circular, flattened, or slightly concave, and has its long diameter directed upwards and outwards towards the axilla; they are separated from the Pectoral muscles by a thin layer of superficial fascia. The outer surface of the mamma is convex, and presents, just below the centre, a small conical prominence, the nipple [mammilla). The surface of the nipple is dark-coloured, and surrounded by an areola having a coloured tint. In the virgin the areola is of a delicate rosy hue ; about the second month after impregnation it enlarges and acquires a darker tinge, which increases as pregnancy advances, becoming in some cases of a dark brown,THE MAMMARY GLAND T045 or even black colour. This colour diminishes as soon as lactation is over, but is never entirely lost throughout life. These changes in the colour of the areola are of importance in forming a conclusion in a case of suspected first pregnancy. The nipple is a cylindrical or conical eminence, capable of undergoing a sort of erection from mechanical excitement, a change mainly due to the contraction of its muscular fibres. It is of a pink or brownish hue, its surface wrinkled and provided with papillae; and it is perforated by numerous orifices, the apertures of the lactiferous ducts. Near the base of the nipple, and upon the surface of the areola, are numerous sebaceous glands, which become much enlarged during lactation, and present the appearance of small tubercles beneath the skin. These glands secrete a peculiar fatty substance, which serves as a protection to the integument of the nipple during the act of sucking. The nipple consists of numerous vessels, intermixed with plain muscular fibres which are principally arranged in a circular manner around the base : some few^ fibres radiating from base to apex. Structure.—The mamma consists of gland-tissue; of fibrous tissue, connecting its lobes ; and of fatty tissue in the intervals between the lobes. The gland-ti.ssue, when freed from fibrous tissue and fat, is of a pale reddish colour, firm in texture, circular in form, flattened from before backwards, thicker in the centre than at the circumference, and presenting several inequalities on its surface, especially in front. It consists of numerous lobes, and these are composed of lobules, connected together by areolar tissue, blood-vessels, and ducts. The smallest lobules consist of a cluster of rounded vesicles, which open into the smallest branches of the lactiferous ducts ; these ducts uniting form larger ducts, which terminate in a single canal, correspond- ing with one of the chief subdivisions of the gland. The number of excretory ducts varies from fifteen to twenty : they are termed the tuhuli lactiferi, or galactophori. They converge towards the areola, beneath which they form dilatations, or ampuUcBy which serve as reservoirs for the milk, and, at the base of the nipple, become contracted, and pursue a straight course to its summit, perforating it by separate orifices considerably narrower than the ducts themselves. The ducts are composed of areolar tissue, with longitudinal and transverse elastic fibres, and longitudinal muscular fibres : their mucous lining is continuous, at the point of the nipple, with the integument. The epithelium of the mammary gland differs according to the state of activity of the organ. In the gland of a woman who is not pregnant or suckling, the alveoli are very small and solid, being filled with a mass of granular polyhedral cells. During pregnancy the alveoli enlarge, and the cells undergo rapid multiplication. At the commencement of lactation, the cells in the centre of the alveolus undergo fatty degeneration, and are eliminated in the first milk, as colostrum corpuscles. The peripheral cells of the alveolus remain, and form a single layer of granular, short columnar cells, with a spherical nucleus, lining the limiting membrana propria. These cells, during the state of activity of the gland, are capable of forming, in their interior, oil-globules, which are then ejected into the lumen of the alveolus, and constitute the milk-globules. The fibrous tissue invests the entire surface of the breast, and sends down septa between its lobes, connecting them together. The fatty tissue surrounds the surface of the gland, and occupies the interval between its lobes. It usually exists in considerable abundance, and determines the form and size of the gland. There is no fat immediately beneath the areola and nipple. Vessels and Nerves,—The arteries supplying the mamm« are derived from the thoracic branches of the axillary, the intercostals, and internal mammary. The veins describe an anastomotic circle round the base of the nipple, called by Haller the circulus venosus. From this, large branches transmit the blood to the circumference of the gland, and end in the axillary and internal mammary veins. The lymphatics, for the most part, run along the lower border of the Pectoralis major to the axillary glands ; some few, from the inner side of the breast, perforate the intercostal spaces and empty themselves into the anterior mediastinal glands. The nerves are derived from the anterior and lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax.THE SUEGICAL AXATOMY OP INGUIXAL HERNIA Dissection (fig. 621 ).—For dissection of the parts concerned in inguinal hernia, a male snbject, free fi'om fat, should always be selected. The body should be placed in the supine position, the abdomen and pelvis raised by means of blocks placed beneath them, and the lower extremities rotated outwards, so as to make the parts as tense as possible. If the abdominal walls are flaccid, the ca\'ity of the abdomen should be inflated by an aperture through the umbihcus. An incision should be made along the middle line, from the mnbilicus to the symphj-sis pubis, and continued along the fr'ont of the scrotum; and a second incision, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to just below the umbilicus. These incisions should divide the integument; and the triangular-shaped flap included between them should be reflected dowTiwards and outwards, when the superficial fascia will be exposed. The Superficial Fascia of the Abdomen.—This, over the greater part of the abdominal wall, consists of a single layer of fascia, which contains a variable amoimt of fat; but as it approaches the groin it is easily di^^sible into two layers, between which are foimd the superficial vessels and nerves and the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands. The superficial layer is thick, areolar in texture, containing adipose tissue in its meshes, the quantity of which varies in different subjects. Below, it passes over Poupart's ligament, and is continuous with the outer layer of the superficial fascia of the thigh. In the male, this fascia is continued over the penis and over the outer surface of the cord to the scrotum, where it helps to form the dartos. As it passes to the penis and over the cord to the scrotum it changes its character, becoming thin, destitute of adipose tissue, and of a pale, reddish colour ; and in the scrotiun it acquires some involuntary muscular fibres. From the scrotum it may be traced backwards, to be continuous with the superficial fascia of the perinjeum. In the female this fascia is continued into the labia majora. The hypogastric branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve perforates the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle about an inch above and a little to the outer side of the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the iutegument of the hypogastric region. The ilio-iiiguinal nerve escapes at the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the upper and inner part of the thigh, to the scrotum in the male ; and to the labium in the female. The superficial epigastric artery arises from the femoral about half an inch below Poupart's ligament, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, ascends on to the abdomen, in the superficial fascia covering the External oblique muscle, nearly as high as the umbilicus. It distributes branches to the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the superficial fascia, and the integument, anastomosing with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary arteries. The superficial circumflex iliac artery, the smallest of the cutaneous branches, arises close to the preceding, and, piercing the fascia lata, runs outwards, parallel with Poupart's ligament, as far as the crest of the ihum, dividing into branches which supply the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the superficial fascia and the integiunent, anastomosing T\-ith the deep circumflex ihac and with the gluteal and external circumflex arteries.SUPERFICIAL FASCIA 1047 The superficial external pudic (suj^erior) artery arises from the inner side of the femoral artery, close to the preceding vessels, and, after passing through the saphenous opening, courses inwards, across the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudic. The superficial veins.—The veins accompanying these superficial vessels are usually much larger than the arteries: they terminate in the internal saphenous vein. The superficial inguinal lymphatic glands are placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups : an upper, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament. Fig. 621.—Inguinal hernia. Superficial dissection. which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietes of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions, and the mucous membrane of the urethra; and an inferior group, which surround the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, a few being sometimes continued along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. This latter group receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The deep layer of the superficial fascia ( fascia of Scarpa) is thinner and more membranous in character than the superficial layer. In the middle hne it is intimately adherent to the linea alba ; above, it is continuous with the superficial fascia over the rest of the trunk ; below, it blends with the fascia lata of the thigh, a little below Poupart's ligament; below and internally, in the male, it is continued over the penis and over the outer surface of the cord to the scrotum, where it helpsSURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA to form the dartos. From the scrotmii it may be traced backwards to be continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinseum. In the female it is continuous with the labia majora. The scrotum is a cutaneous pouch, which contains the testes and part of the spermatic cords, and mto which an inguinal hernia frequently descends (see page 1021). The Aponeurosis of the External Oblique Muscle.—This is a thin, but strong membranous aponeurosis, the fibres of which are directed obliquely downwards and inwards. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends bet^v^een the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the os pubis is a broad band, folded inwards and continuous below vdth. the fascia lata ; it is called Pouparfs ligament. The portion which is reflected from Poupart's ligament at the spine of the os pubis, along the pectineal line, is called GimhernaVs ligament. From the point of attach- ment of the latter to the pectineal line, a few fibres pass upwards and inwards, behind the inner pillar of the rmg to the linea alba. They diverge as they ascend and form a thin, triangular, fibrous band, which is called the triangular ligament of the abdomen. In the aponeurosis of the External oblique, immediately above the crest of the os pubis, is a triangular opening, the external or superficial abdominal ring, formed by the separation of the fibres of the aponeurosis in this situation. The external or superficial abdominal ring.—Just above and to the outer side of the crest of the os pubis, an interval is seen in the aponeurosis of the External oblique, called the external abdominal ring. This aperture is oblique in direction, somewhat triangular in form, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It usually measures from base to apex about an inch, and transversely about half an inch. It is bounded below by the crest of the os pubis ; above by a series of curved fibres, the intercolumnar, which pass across the upper angle of the ring, so as to increase its strength ; and on either side, by the margins of the opening in the aponeurosis, which are called the columns or pillars of the ring. The external pillar, which, at the same time, is inferior from the obliquity of its direction, is the stronger; it is formed by that portion of Poupart's ligament which is inserted into the spine of the os pubis; it is curved, so as to form a kind of groove, upon which the spermatic cord rests. The internal or superior pillar is a broad, thin, flat band, which is attached to the front of the body of the os pubis, interlacing with its fellow of the opposite side, in front of the symphysis pubis, that of the right side being superficial. The external abdominal ring gives passage to the spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female ; it is much larger in men than in women, on account of the large size of the spermatic cord, and hence the great frequency of inguinal hernia in men. The intercolumnar fibres are a series of curved tendinous fibres, which arch across the lower part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique. They have received their name from stretching across between the two pillars of the external ring; they increase the strength of the lower part of the aponeurosis, and prevent the divergence of the pillars from one another. They are thickest below, where they are connected to the outer third of Poupart's ligament ; and are inserted into the linea alba, describing a curve, with the convexity downwards. They are m.uch thicker and stronger at the outer angle of the external ring than internally, and are more strongly developed in the male than in the female. These intercolumnar fibres, as they pass across the external abdominal ring, are themselves connected together by delicate fibrous tissue, thus forming a fascia which, as it is attached to the pillars of the ring, covers it in, and is called the intercolumnar fascia. This intercolumnar fascia is continued downwards as a tubular prolongation around the outer surface of the cord and testis, and encloses them in a distinct sheath, hence it is also called the external spermatic fascia. The sac of an inguinal hernia, in passing through the external abdominal ring, receives an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. If the finger is introduced a short distance into the external ring, and then, ifGIMBERNAT'S LIGAMENT 1049 the limb is extended and rotated outwards, the aponeurosis of the External oblique, together with the iliac portion of the fascia lata, will be felt to become tense, and the external ring much contracted; if the limb is, on the contrary, flexed upon the pelvis and rotated inwards, this aponeurosis will become lax, and the external ring sufficiently enlarged to admit the finger with comparative ease ; hence the patient should always be put in the latter position when the taxis is applied for the reduc- tion of an inguinal hernia, in order that the abdominal walls may be relaxed^ as much as possible. The aponeurosis of the External oblique should be removed by dividing it across in the same direction as the external incisions, and reflecting it downwards and outwards; ^reat care is requisite in separating it from the aponeurosis of the muscle beneath. The lower part of the Internal oblique and the Cremaster are then exposed, together with the inguinal canal, which contains the spermatic cord (fig. 622). The mode of insertion of Poupart's and Gimbernat's hgaments into the os pubis should also be examined. Fig. 622.—Inguinal hernia, showing the Internal oblique, Cremaster, and spermatic canal. Poupart's ligament, or the crural arch, is the lower border of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which extends from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the os pubis. From this latter point it is reflected outwards to be attached to the pectineal line for about half an inch, forming Gimbernat's ligament. Its general direction is curved downwards towards the thigh, where it is continuous with the fascia lata. Its outer half is rounded and oblique in direction ; its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the os pubis, is more horizontal in direction, and lies beneath the spermatic cord. Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 629) is that portion of the External oblique muscle which is reflected downwards and outwards from the spine of the os pubis to be inserted into the pectineal Une. It is about half an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form, with the base directed outwards. Its base or outer margin is concave, thin, and sharp, and lies in contact with the crural sheath, forming theSUEGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HEENIA I050 inner boundary of the crural ring (see fig. 630). Its apex corresponds to the spine of the os pubis. Its posterior margin is attached to the pectineal line, and is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its anterior margin is continuous with Poupart's ligament. The triangular ligament of the abdomen is a band of tendinous fibres, of a triangular shape, which is attached by its apex to the pectineal line, where it is continuous with Gimbernat's ligament. It passes inwards beneath the spermatic cord, and expands into a somewhat fan-shaped fascia, lying behind the inner pillar of the external abdominal ring, and in front of the conjoined tendon, and interlaces with the ligament of the other side at the linea alba. The Internal oblique muscle has been previously described (page 428). The part which is now exposed is partly muscular and partly tendinous in structure. Those fibres which arise from Poupart's ligament, few in number, and paler in colour than the rest, arch downwards and inwards across the spermatic cord, and, becoming tendinous, are inserted conjointly with those of the Transversalis into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis. This tendon is inserted imme- diately behind the external abdominal ring, serving to protect what would other- wise be a weak point in the abdominal wall. Sometimes this tendon is insafficient to resist the pressure from within, and is carried forwards in front of the protrusion through the external ring, forming one of the coverings of direct inguinal hernia ; or the hernia forces its way through the fibres of the conjoined tendon. The Cremaster is a thin muscular layer, composed of a number of fasciculi which arise from the middle of Poupart's ligament at the inner side of the Internal obhque, being connected with that muscle, and also occasionally with the Transversalis. It passes along the outer side of the spermatic cord, descends with it through the external ring upon the front and sides of the cord, and forms a series of loops, which differ in thickness and length in different subjects. Those at the upper part of the cord are exceedingly short, but they become in succession longer and longer, the longest reaching down as low as the testicle, where a few are inserted into the tunica vaginalis. These loops are united together by areolar tissue, and form a thin covering over the cord and testis, ihe^ fascia cremasterica. The fibres ascend along the inner side of the cord, and are inserted by a small pointed tendon into the crest of the os pubis, and front of the sheath of the Rectus muscle. It will be observed that the origin and insertion of the Cremaster is precisely similar to that of the lower fibres of the Internal oblique. This fact affords an easy explanation of the manner in which the testicle and cord are invested by this muscle. At an early period of foetal life the testis is placed at the lower and back part of the abdominal cavity, but during its descent towards the scrotum, which takes place before birth, it passes beneath the arched border of the Internal oblique. In its passage beneath this muscle some fibres are derived from its lower part, which accompany the testicle and cord into the scrotum. It occasionally happens that the loops of the Cremaster surround the cord, some lying behind as well as in front. It is probable that, under these circumstances, the testis, in its descent, passes through, instead of beneath, the fibres of the Internal oblique. In the descent of an oblique inguinal hernia, w^hich takes the same course as the spermatic cord, the Cremaster muscle forms one of its coverings. This muscle becomes largely developed in cases of hydrocele and large old scrotal hernise. No such muscle exists in the female, but an analogous structure is developed in those cases where an oblique inguinal hernia descends beneath the margin of the Internal oblique. The Internal oblique should be detached from Poupart's ligament, separated from the Transversalis to the same extent as in the previous incisions, and reflected inwards on to the sheath of the Eectus (fig. 623). The circumflex iliac vessels, which lie between these two muscles, form a valuable guide to their separation.THE FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS 1051 The Transversalis muscle has been previously described (page 430). The part which is now exposed is partly muscular and partly tendinous in structure ; this portion arises from the outer third of Poupart's Hgament, its fibres curve down- wards and inwards, and are inserted together with those of the Internal oblique into the lower part of the linea alba, into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, forming what is known as the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis. Between the lower border of this muscle and Poupart's ligament, a space is left in which is seen the fascia transversalis. The inguinal or spermatic canal contains the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. It is an obHque canal, about an inch and a half in length, directed downwards and inwards, and placed parallel with, and a little above, Poupart's Hgament. It commences, above, at the internal abdominal ring, which is the point where the cord enters the spermatic canal; and terminates, below, at the external ring. It is bounded, in front, by the integument and Fig. 623.—Inguinal hernia, showing the Transversahs muscle, the transversahs fascia, and the internal abdominal ring. superficial fascia, by the aponeurosis of the External oblique throughout its whole length, and by the Internal oblique for its outer third ; behind, by the triangular ligament, the conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis, trans- versalis fascia, and the subperitoneal fat and peritoneum ; above, by the arched fibres of the Internal oblique and Transversalis ; beloiv, by the union of the fascia transversalis with Poupart's ligament. That form of protrusion in which the intestine follows the course of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal is called oblique inguinal hernia. The fascia transversalis is a thin aponeurotic membrane, which lies between the inner surface of the Transversalis muscle and the peritoneum. It forms part of the general layer of fascia which lines the interior of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, and is directly continuous with the iliac and pelvic fasciae. In the inguinal region, the transversalis fascia is thick and dense in structure, and joined by fibres from the aponeurosis of the Transversalis muscle; but itI052 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA becomes thin and cellular as it ascends to the Diaphragm. Below, it has the following attachments: external to the femoral vessels it is connected to the posterior margin of Poupart's ligament, and is there continuous with the iliac fascia. Internal to the vessels it is thin, and attached to the os pubis and pectineal line behind the conjoined tendon, with which it is united ; and, corresponding to the points where the femoral vessels pass into the thigh, this fascia descends in front of them, forming the anterior wall of the crural sheath. The spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female, pass through this fascia; the point where they pass through is called the internal or deep abdominal ring. This opening is not visible externally owing to a prolongation of the transversalis fascia on these structures, forming the infundibuliform process. The internal or deep abdominal ring is situated in the transversalis fascia, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, and about half an inch above Poupart's ligament. It is of an oval form, the extremities of the oval directed upwards and downwards ; it varies in size in dif- ferent subjects, and is much larger in the male than in the female. It is bounded, above and externally, by the arched fibres of the Transversalis muscle, below and internally by the deep epigastric vessels. It transmits the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. From its circumference a thin, funnel-shaped membrane, the infundibuliform fascia, is continued round the cord and testis, enclosing them in a distinct pouch. When the sac of an oblique inguinal hernia passes through the internal or deep abdominal ring, the infundi- buliform process of the transversalis fascia forms one of its coverings. The subperitoneal areolar tissue.—Between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum is a quantity of loose areolar tissue. In some subjects it is of con- siderable thickness, and loaded with adipose tissue. Opposite the internal ring it is continued round the surface of the cord, forming a loose sheath for it. The deep epigastric artery arises from the external iliac artery a few lines above Poupart's ligament. It at first descends to reach this ligament, and then ascends obliquely along the inner margin of the internal or deep abdominal ring, lying between the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum, and passing upwards pierces the transversalis fascia and enters the sheath of the Rectus muscle just below the semilunar fold of Douglas. Consequently the deep epigastric artery bears a very important relation to the internal abdominal ring, as it passes obliquely upwards and inwards, from its origin from the external iliac. In this part of its course it lies along the lower and inner margin of the internal ring, and beneath the commencement of the spermatic cord. As it winds round the internal abdominal ring it is crossed by the vas deferens in the male, and by the round ligament in the female. The peritoneum, corresponding to the inner surface of the internal ring, presents a well-marked depression, the depth of which varies in different subjects. A thin fibrous band is continued from it along the front of the cord for a variable distance, and becomes ultimately lost. This is the remains of the pouch of peritoneum which, in the foetus, accompanies the cord and testis into the scrotum; the obliteration of which commences soon after birth. In some cases the fibrous band can only be traced a short distance ; but occasionally it may be followed, as a fine cord, as far as the upper end of the tunica vaginalis. Sometimes the tube of peritoneum is only closed at intervals, and presents a sacculated appearance; or a single pouch may extend along the whole length of the cord, which may be closed above ; or the pouch may be directly continuous with the peritoneum by an opening at its upper part. In the female (in the foetus) the peritoneum is also prolonged in the form of a tubular process for a short distance into the inguinal canal. This process is called the canal of Nuck. It is generally obliterated in the adult, but sometimes it remains pervious even in advanced life. It is analogous to the peritoneal pouch which accompanies the descent of the testis.OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA 1053 Inguinal Heenia Inguinal hernia is that form of protrusion which makes its way through the abdomen in the inguinal region. There are two principal varieties of inguinal hernia—external or oblique, and internal or direct. External or oblique inguinal hernia, the more frequent of the two, takes the same course as the spermatic cord. It is called external, from the neck of the sac being on the outer or iliac side of the deep epigastric artery. Internal or direct inguinal hernia does not follow the same course as the cord, but protrudes through the abdominal wall on the inner or pubic side of the deep epigastric artery. Fig. 624.— Oblique inguinal hernia, showing its various coverings. (From a preparation in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) Oblique Inguinal Heenia In oblique inguinal hernia the intestine escapes from the abdominal cavity at the internal ring, pushing before it a pouch of peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac (fig. 625, a)^. As it enters the inguinal canal it receives an investment from the subserous areolar tissue, and is enclosed in the infundibuliform process of the transversahs fascia. In passing along the inguinal canal it displaces upwards he arched fibres of the Transversahs and Internal obhque muscles, and is surrounded by the fibres of the Cremaster. It then passes along the front of the cord and escapes from the inguinal canal at the external ring, receiving an investment fromSURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA I054 the intercolnmnar fascia. Lastly, it descends into the scrotum, receiving covenngs from the superficial fascia and the mtegument. Fig. 625.—Varieties of oblique inguinal hernia. Sac of hernia Z. —Sac of hernia ginalis Tunica vagina 1 is.--L of hernia E. Hernia into the fuuiciilar process. The coverings of this form of hernia, after it has passed through the external ring, are, from without inwards, the integument, superficial fascia, mtercolumnarOBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA 1055 fascia, Cremaster muscle, infimdibuliform fascia, subserous areolar tissue, and peritoneum. This form of hernia lies in front of the vessels of the spermatic cord, and seldom extends below the testis, on account of the intimate adhesion of the coverings of the cord to the tunica vaginalis. The seat of stricture in oblique inguinal hernia is either at the external ring ; in the inguinal canal, caused by the fibres of the Internal oblique or Transversalis ; or at the internal ring ; most frequently in the latter situation. If it is situated at the external ring, the division of a few fibres at one point of its circumference is all that is necessary for the replacement of the hernia. If in the inguinal canal, or at the internal ring, it may be necessary to divide the aponeurosis of the External oblique so as to lay open the inguinal canal. In dividing the stricture, the direction of the incision should be upwards. When the intestine passes along the spermatic canal, and escapes from the external ring into the scrotum, it is called complete oblique inguinal, or scrotal hernia. If the intestine does not escape from the external ring, but is retained in the inguinal canal, it is called incomplete inguinal hernia, or bubonocele. In each of these cases, the coverings which invest it will depend upon the extent to which it descends in the inguinal canal. There are some other varieties of oblique inguinal hernia depending upon congenital defects in the processus vaginalis. The testicle in its descent from the abdomen into the scrotum is accompanied by a pouch of peritoneum, which about the period of birth becomes shut off from the general peritoneal cavity by a closure of that portion of the pouch which extends from the internal abdominal ring to near the upper part of the testicle ; the lower portion of the pouch remaining per- sistent as the tunica vaginalis. It would appear that this closure commences at two points, viz. at the internal abdominal ring, and at the top of the epididymis, and gradually extends until, in the normal condition, the whole of the intervening portion is converted into a fibrous cord. From failure in the completion of this process, variations in the relation of the hernial protrusion to the testicle and tunica vaginalis are produced, which constitute distinct varieties of inguinal hernia, and which have received separate names, and are of surgical importance. These are congenital, infantile, encysted, and hernia of the funicular process. Congenital hernia (fig. 625, b).—Where the pouch of peritoneum which accompanies the cord and testis in its descent remains patent throughout, and is unclosed at any point, the cavity of the tunica vaginalis communicates directly with the peritoneum. The intestine descends along this pouch into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, which constitutes the sac of the hernia, and the gut lies in contact with the testicle. Infantile and encysted hernia.—Where the poach of peritoneum is occluded at the internal ring only, and remains patent throughout the rest of its extent, two varieties of oblique inguinal hernia may be produced, which have received the names of infantile and encysted hernia. In the infantile form (fig. 625, c) the bowel pressing upon the septum and the peritoneum in its immediate neighbourhood causes it to yield and form a sac, which descends behind the tunica vaginalis ; so that, in front of the bowel, there are three layers of peritoneum, the two layers of the tunica vaginalis and its own sac. In the encysted form (fig. 625, d) pressure in the same position—namely, at the occluded spot in the pouch—causes the septum to yield and form a sac which projects into and not behind the tunica vaginalis, as in the infantile form, and thus it constitutes a sac within a sac. so that in front of the bowel there are two layers of peritoneum, one layer of the tunica vaginalis and its own sac. Hernia into the funicular process (fig. 625, e).—Where the pouch of peritoneum is occluded at the lower point only, that is, just above the testicle, the intestine descends into the pouch of peritoneum as far as the testicle, but is prevented from entering the sac of the tunica vaginalis by the septum which has formed between it and the pouch, so that it resembles the congenital form in all respects,1056 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA except that, instead of enveloping the testicle, that body can be felt below the rupture. Direct Inguinal Heenia In direct inguinal hernia the protrusion makes its way through some part of the abdominal wall internal to the epigastric artery. At the lower part of the abdominal wall is a triangular space (Hesselbach's triangle), bounded, externally, by the deep epigastric artery ; internally, by the margin of the Rectus muscle ; below, by Poupart's ligament. The conjoined tendon is stretched across the inner two-thirds of this space, the remaining portion of the space having only the subperitoneal areolar tissue, and the transversalis fascia between the peritoneum and the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle. In some cases the hernial protrusion escapes from the abdomen on the outer side of the conjoined tendon, pushing before it the peritoneum, the subserous areolar tissue, and the transversalis fascia. It then enters the inguinal canal, passing along nearly its whole length, and finally emerges from the external ring, receiving an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. The coverings of this form of hernia are precisely similar to those investing the oblique form, with the insignificant difference that the infundibuliform fascia is replaced by a portion derived from the general layer of the fascia transversalis. In other cases, and this is the more frequent variety, the hernia is either forced through the fibres of the conjoined tendon, or the tendon is gradually distended in front of it, so as to form a complete investment for it. The intestine then enters the lower end of the inguinal canal, escapes at the external ring, lying on the inner side of the cord, and receives additional coverings from the superficial fascia and the integument. This form of hernia has the same coverings as the oblique variety, excepting that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the Cremaster, and the infundibuliform fascia is replaced by a portion derived from the general layer of the fascia transversalis. The difference between the position of the neck of the sac in these two forms of direct inguinal hernia has been referred, with some probability, to a difference in the relative positions of the obliterated hypogastric artery and the deep epigastric artery. "When the course of the obliterated hypogastric artery corresponds pretty nearly with that of the deep epigastric, Avhich is regarded as the normal arrange- ment, the projection of these arteries towards the cavity of the abdomen produces two fossae in the peritoneum. The bottom of the external fossa of the peritoneum corresponds to the position of the internal abdominal ring, and a hernia which distends and pushes out the peritoneum lining this fossa is an oblique hernia. When, on the other hand, the obliterated hypogastric artery lies considerably to the inner side of the deep epigastric artery, corresponding to the outer margin of the conjoined tendon, it divides the triangle of Hesselbach into two parts, so that three depressions will be seen on the inner surface of the lower part of the abdominal wall: viz. an external one, on the outer side of the deep epigastric artery ; a middle one, between the deep epigastric and the obliterated hypogastric arteries; and an internal one, on the inner side of the obliterated hypogastric artery. In such a case a hernia may distend and push out the peritoneum forming the bottom of either fossa. When the hernia distends and pushes out the peritoneum forming the bottom of the external fossa, it is an oblique or external inguinal hernia. When the hernia distends and pushes out the peritoneum forming the bottom of either the middle or the internal fossa, it is a direct or internal hernia. The anatomical difference between these two forms of direct or internal inguinal hernia is that, when the hernia protrudes through the middle fossa—that is, the fossa between the deep epigastric and the obliterated hypogastric arteries—it will enter the upper part of the inguinal canal; consequently its coverings will be the same as those of an oblique hernia, with the insignificant difference that the infundibuliform fascia is replaced by a portion derived from the general layer ofDIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA the fascia transversalis, whereas when the hernia protrudes through the internal fossa it is either forced through the fibres of the conjoined tendon, or the tendon is gradually distended in front of it, so as to form a com]3lete investment for it. The intestine then enters the lower part of the inguinal canal, and escapes from the external abdominal ring lying on the inner side of the cord. This form of hernia has the same coverings as the oblique variety, excepting that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the Cremaster, and the infundibuli- form fascia is replaced by a portion derived from the general layer of the fascia transversalis. The seat of stricture in both varieties of direct hernia is most frequently at the neck of the sac, or at the external ring. In that form of hernia which perforates the conjoined tendon, it not unfrequently occurs at the edges of the fissure through which the gut passes. In dividing the stricture, the incision should in all cases be directed upwards.* If the hernial protrusion passes into the inguinal canal, but does not escape from the external abdominal ring, it forms what is called incoiiqjlete direct hernia. This form of hernia is usually of small size, and in corpulent persons very difficult of detection. Direct inguinal hernia is of much less frequent occurrence than the oblique, their comparative frequency being, according to Cloquet, as one to five. It occurs far more frequently in men than in women, on account of the larger size of the external ring in the former sex. It differs from the oblique in its smaller size and globular form, dependent most probably on the resistance offered to its progress by the transversalis fascia and conjoined tendon. It differs also in its position, being placed over the os pubis, and not in the course of the inguinal canal. The deep epigastric artery runs on the outer or iliac side of the neck of the sac, and the spermatic cord along its external and posterior side, not directly behind it, as in oblique inguinal hernia. * In all cases of inguinal hernia, whether oblique or direct, it is proper to divide the stricture directly upwards ; the reason of this is obvious, for by cutting in this direction the incision is made parallel to the deep epigastric artery—either external to it, in the oblique variety ; or internal to it, in the direct form of hernia; and thus all chance of wounding the vessel is avoided. If the incision was made outwards, the artery might be divided if the hernia was direct ; and if made inwards it would stand an equal chance of injury if the case was one of oblique inguinal hernia.SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMOEAL HEENIA The dissection of the parts comprised in tlie anatomy of femoral hernia should be performed, if possible, upon a female subject free from fat. The subject should lie upon its back ; a block is first placed under the pelvis, the thigh everted, and the knee slightly bent, and retained in this position. An incision should then be made from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium along Poupart's ligament to the symphysis pubis ; a second incision should be carried transversely across the thigh about six inches beneath the preceding; and these are to be connected together by a vertical one carried along the inner side of the thigh. These several incisions should divide merely the integument ; this is to be reflected outwards, when the superficial fascia will be exposed. The superficial fascia forms a continuous layer over the whole of the thigh, consisting of areolar tissue, containing in its meshes much fat, and capable of being separated into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves. It varies in thickness in different parts of the limb. In the groin it is thick, and the two layers are separated from one another by the super- ficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the internal saphenous vein, and several smaller vessels. One of these layers, the superficial, is continuous with the superficial fascia of the abdomen. The superficial layer should be detached by dividing it across in the same direction as the external incisions ; its removal will be facilitated by commencing at the lower and inner angle of the space, detaching it at first from the front of the internal saphenous vein, and dissecting it off from the anterior sm'face of that vessel and its tributaries; it should then be reflected outwards, in the same manner as the integument. The cutaneous vessels and nerves, and superficial inguinal glands, are then exposed, lying upon the deep layer of the superficial fascia. These are the internal saphenous vein, and the superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac, and superficial external pudic vessels, as well as numerous lymphatics ascending with the saphenous vein to the inguinal glands. The internal or long saphenous vein ascends along the inner side of the thigh, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, terminates in the femoral vein about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. This vein receives, at the saphenous opening, the superficial epigastric, the superficial circumflex iliac, and the superficial external pudic veins. The superficial external pudic artery (superior) arises from the inner side of the femoral artery, and, after passing through the saphenous opening, courses inwards, across the spermatic cord, to be distributed to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen, the penis and scrotum in the male, and the labium in the female, anastomosing with branches of the internal pudic. The superficial epigastric artery arises from the femoral, about half an inch below Poupart's ligament, and, passing through the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, ascends on to the abdomen, in the superficial fascia covering the External oblique muscle, nearly as high as the umbilicus. It distributes branches to the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the superficial fascia, and the integument, anastomosing with branches of the deep epigastric and internal mammary arteries. The superficial circmnfiex iliac artery, the smallest of the cutaneous branches, arises close to the preceding, and, piercing the fascia lata, runs outwards, parallel with Poupart's ligament, as far as the crest of the ilium, dividing into branches which supply the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the superficial fascia, and1059 FEMORAL HERNIA the integument of the groin, anastomosing with the deep circmiiflex ihac, and with the ghiteal and external circumflex arteries. The siq^erficial veins.—The veins accompanying these superficial arteries are usually much larger than the arteries : they terminate in the internal or long saphenous vein at the saphenous opening. The superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, placed immediately beneath the integument, are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are divisible into two groups : an upper, disposed irregularly along Poupart's ligament, which receive the lymphatic vessels from the integument of the scrotum, penis, parietes of the abdomen, perineal and gluteal regions, and the mucous membrane of the urethra; and an inferior group, which surround the saphenous opening in Fig. 626.—-Femoral hernia. Superficial dissection. the fascia lata, a few being sometimes continued along the saphenous vein to a variable extent. This latter group receive the superficial lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The ilio-inguinal nerve arises from the first lumbar nerve. It escapes at the external abdominal ring, and is distributed to the integument of the upper and inner part of the thigh : to the scrotum in the male, and to the labium in the female. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the ilio-hypo- gastric. Occasionally it is very small, and ends by joining the ilio-hypogastric : in such cases a branch of the ilio-hypogastric takes the place of the ilio-inguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent. The crural branch of the genito- crural nerve passes along the inner margin of the Psoas muscle, beneath Poupart's ligament, into the thigh, entering the sheath of the femoral vessels, and lying 3 Y 2io6o SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA superficial and a little external to the femoral artery. It pierces the anterior layer of the sheath of the vessels, and, becoming superficial by passing through the fascia lata, it supplies the skin of the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the pelvis and knee. On the front of the thigh it communicates with the outer branch of the middle cutaneous nerve, derived from the anterior crural. The dee;p layer of the superficial.fascia is a very thin fibrous layer, best marked on the inner side of the long saphenous vein and below Poupart's ligament. It is placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the fascia lata, to which it is intimately adherent at the lower margin of Poupart's ligament. It covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata, is closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels corre- FiG. 627.—Femoral hernia, showing fascia lata and saphenous opening. sponding to its under surface. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vein, and by numerous blood and lymphatic vessels ; hence it has been termed the cribriform fascia, the openings for these vessels having been likened to the holes in a sieve. The cribriform fascia adheres closely both to the superficial fascia and to the fascia lata, so that it is described by some anatomists as a part of the fascia lata, but it is usually considered (as in this work) as belonging to the superficial fascia. It is not till the cribriform fascia has been cleared away that the saphenous opening is seen, so that this opening does not in ordinary cases exist naturally, but is the result of dissection. A femoral hernia, in passing through the saphenous opening, receives the cribriform fascia as one of its coverings. The deep layer of superficial fascia, together with the cribriform fascia, having been removed, the fascia lata is exposed.1061 POUPART'S LIGAMENT The Fascia Lata has been ah-eady described with the muscles of the front of the thigh (page 485). At the upper and inner part of the thigh, a httle below Poupart's ligament, a large oval-shaped aperture is observed after the superficial fascia has been cleared away ; it transmits the internal saphenous vein and other smaller vessels, and is called the saphenoiis openmg. In order the more correctly to consider the mode of formation of this aperture, the fascia lata in this part of the thigh is described as consisting of two portions, an iliac portion and a pubic portion. The iliac jjortion is all that part of the fascia lata on the outer side of the saphenous opening. It is attached externally to the crest of the ilium and its anterior superior spine ; to the whole length of Poupart's ligament as far internally as the spine of the os pubis; and to the pectineal line in conjunction with Gimbernat's ligament. From the spine of the os pubis it is reflected downwards and outwards, forming an arched margin, the outer boundary, or falciform process or superior cornu of the saphenous opening. This margin overlies and is adherent to the anterior layer of the sheath of the femoral vessels; to its edge is attached the cribriform fascia, and, below, it is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The imhic 'portion of the fascia lata is situated at the inner side of the saphenous opening : at the lower margin of this aperture it is continuous with the iliac portion : traced upwards, it covers the surface of the Pectineus, Adductor longus, and Gracilis muscles ; and, passing behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, to which it is closely united, is continuous with the sheath of the Psoas and Iliacus muscles, and is attached above to the ilio-pectineal line, where it becomes continuous with the fascia covering the Iliacus muscle. From this description it may be observed that the iliac portion of the fascia lata passes in front of the femoral vessels and the pubic portion behind them, so that an apparent aperture consequently exists between the two, through which the internal saphenous joins the femoral vein. The Saphenous Opening is an oval-shaped aperture, measuring about an inch and a half in length, and half an inch in width. It is situated at the upper and inner part of the front of the thigh, below Poupart's ligament, and is directed obliquely downwards and outwards. Its outer margin is of a semilunar form, thin, strong, sharply defined, and lies on a plane considerably anterior to the inner margin. If this edge is traced upwards, it will be seen to form a curved elongated process, the falciform process, or superior cornu, which ascends in front of the femoral vessels, and, curving inwards, is attached to Poupart's ligament and to the spine of the os pubis and pectineal line, where it is continuous with the pubic portion. If traced down- wards, it' is found continuous with another curved margin, the concavity of which is directed upwards and inwards : this is the inferior cornu of the saphenous opening, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the Pectineus muscle. The inner boundary of the opening is on a plane posterior to the outer margin and behind the level of the femoral vessels ; it is much less prominent and defined than the outer, from being stretched over the subjacent Pectineus muscle. It is through the saphenous opening that a femoral hernia passes after descending along the crural canal. If the finger is introduced into the saphenous opening while the limb is moved in different directions, the aperture will be found to be greatly constricted on extending the limb or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexing the limb and inverting it : hence the necessity for placing the limb in the latter position in employing the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. The iliac portion of tlie fascia lata, but not its falciform process, should now be removed by detaching it from the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, carefully dissecting it from the subjacent structures, and turning it inwards, when the sheath of the femoral vessels is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (hg. 628). Poupart's Ligament, or the Crural Arch, is the lower border of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which extends from the anterior superior spine ofio62 SUKGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMOEAL HERNIA the ilium to the spine of the os pubis. From this latter point it is reflected outwards, to be attached to the pectineal line for about half an inch, forming Gimbernat's ligament. Its general direction is curved downwards towards the thigh, where it is continuous with the fascia lata. Its outer half is rounded and oblique in direction. Its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the os pubis, is more horizontal in direction, and lies beneath the spermatic cord. Nearly the whole of the space included between the crural arch and innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdomen into the thigh. The outer half of the space is occupied by the Iliacus and Psoas muscles, together with the external cutaneous and anterior crural nerves. The pubic half of the space is Fig. 628.—Femoral hernia. Iliac portion of fascia lata removed, and sheath of femoral vessels and femoral canal exposed. occupied by the femoral vessels included in their sheath ; a small oval-shaped interval existing between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the sheath, which is occupied merely by a little loose areolar tissue, a few lymphatic vessels, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland : this is the crural ring, through which the gut descends in femoral hernia. Grimbernat's Ligament (fig. 630) is that part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle which is reflected downwards and outwards, from the spine of the OS pubis, to be inserted into the pectineal line. It is about half an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form, with the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin, and sharp, and lies in contact with the crural sheath. Its ai^ex corresponds to the spine of the os pubis. Its posterior margin attached to the pectineal line, and is continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its anterior margin is continuous with Poupart's ligament.1063 DEEP CEUEAL ARCH Crural Sheath.—The femoral or crural sheath is a continuation downwards of the fasciae that line the abdomen, the transversalis fascia passing down in front of the femoral vessels, and the iliac fascia descending behind them : these fasciae are directly continuous on the iliac side of the femoral artery, but a small space exists between the femoral vein and the point where they are continuous on the pubic side of that vessel, which constitutes the femoral or crural canal. The femoral sheath is closely adherent to the contained vessels about an inch below the saphenous opening, being blended with the areolar sheath of the vessels, but opposite Poupart's ligament it is much larger than is required to contain them; hence the funnel-shaped form which it presents. The outer border of the sheath is perforated by the genito-crural nerve. Its inner border is pierced by the internal Fig. 629.—Structures which pass beneath the crural arch. External Femoral artertj saphenous vein and numerous lymphatic vessels. In front, it is covered by the iliac portion of the fascia lata ; and behind it is the pubic portion of the same fascia. If the anterior wall of the sheath is removed, the femoral artery and vein are seen lying side by side, a thin septum separating the two vessels, while another septum may be seen lying just internal to the vein, and cutting off a small space between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath. The septar are stretched between the anterior and posterior walls of the sheath, so that each vessel is enclosed in a separate compartment. The interval left between the vein and the inner wall of the sheath is not filled up by any structure, excepting a little loose areolar tissue, a few lymphatic vessels, and occasionally by a small lymphatic gland : this is the femoral or crural canal, through which the intestine descends in femoral hernia. Deep Crural Arch.—Passing across the front of the crural sheath on the1064 SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA abdominal side of Ponpart's ligament, and closely connected with it, is a thickened band of fibres, called the dee]j crural arch. It is apparently a thickening of the fascia transversalis, joining externally to the centre of Ponpart's ligament, and arching across the front of the crural sheath, to be inserted by a broad attachment into the pectineal line, behind the conjoined tendon. In some subjects this structure is not very prominently marked, and not unfrequently it is altogether wanting. The crural canal is the narrow interval between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the crural sheath. It exists as a distinct canal only when the sheath has been separated from the vein by dissection, or by the pressure of a hernia or tumour. Its length is from a quarter to half an inch, and it extends from Gimbernat's ligament to the upper part of the saphenous opening. Its anterior wall is very narrow, and formed by a continuation downwards of the fascia transversalis, under Poupart's ligament, covered by the falciform process of the fascia lata. Fig. 630.—Hernia. The relations of the femoral and internal abdominal rings seen from within the abdomen. Eight side. Its iwsterior ivall is formed by a continuation downwards of the iliac fascia covering the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its outer icall is formed by the fibrous septum separating it from the inner side of the femoral vein. Its inner wall is formed by the junction of the processes of the transversalis and iliac fasciae, which form the inner side of the femoral sheath, and lies in contact, at its commencement, with the outer edge of Gimbernat's ligament. This canal has two orifices—an upper one, the femoral or crural ring, closed by the septum crurale ; and a lower one, the saijhenous opening, closed by the cribriform fascia. The femoral or crural ring (fig. 630) is the upper opening of the femoral canal, and leads into the cavity of the abdomen. It is bounded, in front, by Poupart's ligament and the deep crural arch ; behind, by the os pubis, covered by the Pectineus muscle, and the pubic portion of the fascia lata ; internally, by the base of Gimbernat's ligament, the conjoined tendon, the transversalis fascia, and the deep crural arch ; externally, by the fibrous septum lying on the inner side of the femoral vein. The femoral ring is of an oval form ; its long diameter, directedSEPTUM CRURALE transversely, measures about half an inch, and it is larger in the female than in the male, which is one of the reasons of the greater frequency of femoral hernia in the former sex. Position o f parts around the ring.—The spermatic cord in the male, and round ligament in the female, lie immediately above the anterior margin of the femoral ring, and may be divided in an operation for femoral hernia if the incision for the relief of the stricture is not of limited extent. In the female this is of little importance, but in the male the spermatic artery and vas deferens may be divided. The femoral rem lies on the outer side of the ring. The deep epigastric artery, in its passage upwards and inwards from the external ♦iliac artery, passes across the upper and outer angle of the crural ring, and is consequently in danger of being wounded if the stricture is divided in a direction upwards and outwards. The coinmunicating branch between the deep epigastric and obturator lies in front of the ring. The circumference of the ring is thus seen to be bounded by vessels in every part, excepting internally and behind. It is in the former position that the stricture is divided in cases of strangulated femoral hernia. The obturator artery, when it arises by a common trunk with the deep epigastric, which occurs once in every three subjects and a half, bears a very important relation to the crural ring. In some cases it descends on the inner side of the external iliac vein to the obturator foramen, and will consequently lie on the outer side of the crural ring, where there is no danger of its being wounded in the operation for dividing the stricture in femoral hernia (see fig. 373, page 605, fig. A). Occasionally, however, the obturator artery curves along the free margin of Gimbernat's ligament in its passage to the obturator foramen ; it would, conse- quently, skirt along the greater part of the circumference of the crural ring, and could hardly avoid being wounded in the operation (see fig. 373, page 605, fig. B). Septum Crurale.—The femoral ring is closed by a layer of condensed areolar tissue, called, by J. Cloquet, tlie septum crurale. This serves as a barrier to the protrusion of a hernia through this part. Its upper surface is slightly concave, and supports a small lymphatic gland, by which it is separated from the subserous areolar tissue and peritoneum. Its under surface is turned towards the femoral canal. The septum crurale is perforated by numerous apertures for the passage of lymphatic vessels, connecting the deep inguinal lymphatic glands with those surrounding the external iliac artery. The size of the femoral canal, the degree of tension of its orifices, and, consequently, the degree of constriction of a hernia, vary according to the position of the limb. If the leg and thigh are extended, abducted, or everted, the femoral canal and its orifices are rendered tense, from the traction on these parts by Poupart's ligament and the fascia lata, as may be ascertained by passing the finger along the canal. If, on the contrary, the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis, and at the same time adducted and rotated inwards, the femoral canal and its orifices become considerably relaxed ; for this reason the limb should always be placed in the latter position when the application of the taxis is made in attempting the reduction of a femoral hernia. The subperitoneol areolar tissue is continuous with the subserous areolar tissue of surrounding parts. It is usually thickest and most fibrous where the iliac vessels leave the abdominal cavity. It covers over the small interval (crm^al ring) on the inner side of the femoral vein. In some subjects it contains a considerable amount of adipose tissue. In such cases, where it is protruded forwards in front of the sac of a femoral hernia, it may be mistaken for a portion of omentum. The peritoneum lining the portion of the abdominal wall between Poupart's ligament and the brim of the pelvis is similar to that lining any other portion of the abdominal wall, being very thin. It has here no natural aperture for the escape of intestine.io66 SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA Descent of the Hernia.—From the preceding description it follows that the femoral ring must be a weak point in the abdominal wall: hence it is that, when violent or long-continued pressm'e is made upon the abdominal viscera, a portion of intestine may be forced into it, constituting a femoral hernia; and the changes in the tissues of the abdomen which are produced by pregnancy, together with the larger size of this aperture in the female, serve to explain the frequency of this form of hernia in women. When a portion of the intestine is forced through the femoral ring, it carries before it a pouch of peritoneum, which forms what is called the hernial sac; it receives an investment from the subserous areolar tissue, and from the septum crurale, and descends vertically along the crural canal in the inner compartment of the sheath of the femoral vessels as far as the saphenous opening; at this point it changes its course, being prevented from extending farther down the sheath, on account of the narrowing of the sheath and its close contact with the vessels, and also from the close attachment of the superficial fascia and crural sheath to the lower part of the circumference of the saphenous opening; the tumour is, conse- quently, directed forwards, pushing before it the cribriform fascia, and then curves upwards on to the falciform process of the fascia lata and lower part of the tendon of the External oblique, being covered by the superficial fascia and integument. While the hernia is contained in the femoral canal, it is usually of small size, owing to the resisting nature of the surrounding parts ; but when it has escaped from the saphenous opening into the loose areolar tissue of the groin, it becomes considerably enlarged. The direction taken by a femoral hernia in its descent is at first downwards, then forwards and upwards; this should be borne in mind, as in the application of the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia pressure should be directed in the reverse order. Coverings of the Hernia.—The coverings of a femoral hernia, from within outwards, are : peritoneum, subserous areolar tissue, the septum crurale, crural sheath, cribriform fascia, superficial fascia, and integument.* Varieties of Femoral Hernia.—If the intestine descends along the femoral canal only as far as the saphenous opening, and does not escape from this aperture, it is called incomplete femoral hernia. The small size of the protrusion m this form of hernia, on account of the firm and resisting nature of the canal in which it is contained, renders it an exceedingly dangerous variety of the disease, from the extreme difficulty of detecting the existence of the swelling, especially in corpulent subjects. The coverings of an incomplete femoral hernia would be, from without inwards : integument, superficial fascia, falciform process of fascia lata, crural sheath, septum crurale, subserous areolar tissue, and peritoneum. When, however, the hernial tumour protrudes through the saphenous opening, and directs itself forwards and upwards, it forms a complete femoral hernia. Occasionally the hernial sac descends on the iliac side of the femoral vessels, or in front of these vessels, or even sometimes behind them. The seat of stricture of a femoral hernia varies : it may be in the peritoneum at the neck of the hernial sac; in the greater number of cases it would appear to be at the point of junction of the falciform process of the fascia lata with the lunated edge of Gimbernat's ligament; or at the margin of the saphenous opening in the thigh. The stricture should in every case be divided in a direction upwards and inwards ; and the extent necessary in the majority of cases is about two or three lines. By these means, aU vessels or other structures of importance, in relation with the neck of the hernial sac, will be avoided. * Sir Astley Cooper has described an investment for femoral hernia, under the name of ' fascia propria,' lying immediately' external to the peritoneal sac. but frequently separated from it by more or less adipose tissue. Sm-gically, it is important to remember the existence (at any rate, the occasional existence) of this layer, on account of the ease with which an inexperienced operator may mistake the fascia for the peritoneal sac, and the contained fat for omentum. Anatomically, this fascia appears identical with what is called in the text ' subserous areolar tissue,' the areolar tissue being thickened and caused to assume a membranous appearance by the pressure of the hernia.SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF THE ISCHIO-EEGTAL REGION AND PEEINGUM Dissection.—The student should select a well-developed muscular subject, free from fat, and the dissection shoidd be commenced early, in order that the parts may be examined in as recent a state as possible. A staff having been introduced into the bladder, and the subject placed in the position shown in fig. 631, the scrotum should be raised upwards, and retained in that position, and the rectum moderately distended with tow. The space which is now to be examined corresponds to the inferior aperture or outlet of the pelvis. Its deep boundaries are, in front, the pubic arch and subpubic ligament; behind, the tip of the coccyx ; and on each side, the rami of the pubes and ischium, the tuberosities of the ischium, and great sacro-sciatic ligaments. The space included by these boundaries is somewhat lozenge-shaped, and is limited on the surface of the body by the scrotum in front, by the buttocks behind, and on each side by the inner side of the thighs. A line drawn transversely between the anterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium, on each side, in front of the anus, divides this space into two portions. The anterior portion contains the penis and urethra, and is called the perinczum. The posterior portion contains the termination of the rectum, and is called the iscliio-rectal region. TSCHIO-RECTAL ReGION The ischio-rectal region corresponds to the portion of the outlet of the pelvis situated immediately behind the perineum : it contains the termination of the rectum and a deep fossa, filled with fat, on each side of the intestine, between it and the tuberosity of the ischium: this is called the ischio-rectal fossa. The ischio-rectal region presents in the middle line the aperture of the anus ; around this orifice, the integument is thrown into numerous folds, which are obliterated on distension of the intestine. The integument is of a dark colour, continuous with the mucous membrane of the rectum, and provided with numerous follicles, which occasionally inflame and suppurate, and may be mistaken for fistulas. The veins around the margin of the anus are occasionally much dilated, forming a number of hard pendent masses, of a dark bluish colour, covered partly by mucous membrane and partly by the integument. These tumours constitute the disease called external piles. Dissection (fig. 631).—Make an incision through the integument, along the median line, from the base of the scrotum to the anterior extremity of the anus : carry it round the margins of this aperture to its posterior extremity, and continue it backwards to about an inch behind the tip of the coccyx. K. transverse incision should now be carried across the base of the scrotum, joining the anterior extremity of the preceding; a second, carried in the same direction, should be made in front of the anus ; and a third at the posterior extremity of the first incision. These incisions should be sufficiently extensive to enable the dissector to raise the integument from the inner side of the thighs. The flaps of skin corresponding to the ischio-rectal region should now be removed. In dissecting the integument from this region great care is required, otherwise the Corrugator cutis aui and External sphincter will be removed, as they are intimately adherent to the skin.io68 SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM The superficial fascia is exposed on the removal of the skin : it is very thick, areolar in texture, and contains much fat in its meshes. In it are found ramifying two or three cutaneous branches of the small sciatic nerve ; these turn round the inferior border of the Gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the integument around the anus. In this region, and connected Avith the lower end of the rectum, are four muscles : the Gorrugator cutis ani; the two Sphincters, External and Internal; and the Levator ani. These muscles have been already described (see page 436). The ischio-reetal fossa is situated between the end of the rectum and the tuberosity of the ischium on each side. It is triangular in shape ; its base, directed to the surface of the body, is formed by the integument of the ischio-rectal region ; its aioex, directed upwards, corresponds to the point of division of the obturator fascia, and the thin membrane given off from it, which covers the outer surface of the Levator ani (ischio-rectal or anal fascia). Its dimensions are about an inch in breadth at the base, and about two inches in depth, being deeper behind than in front. It is bounded, internally, by the Sphincter ani. Levator ani, and Coccygeus Fig. 631.—Dissection of perinaeum and ischio-rectal region. muscles ; externally, by the tuberosity of the ischium and the obturator fascia, which covers the inner surface of the Obturator internus muscle; in front, it is limited by the line of junction of the superficial and deep perineal fasciae ; and behind, by the margin of the Gluteus maximus, and the great sacro-sciatic ligament. This space is filled w4th a large mass of adipose tissue, which explains the frequency with which abscesses in the neighbourhood of the rectum burrow to a considerable depth. If the subject has been injected, on placing the finger on the outer wall of this fossa, the internal pudic artery, with its accompanying veins and nerve, will be felt about an inch and a half above the margin of the ischiatic tuberosity, but approaching nearer the surface as they pass forwards along the inner margin of the pubic arch. These structures are enclosed in a sheath (canal of Alcock) formed by the obturator fascia, the pudic nerve lying below the artery (fig. 374). Crossing the space transversely, about its centre, are the j nferior hsemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, branches of the internal pudic ; they are distributed to the integument of the anus, and to the muscles of the lower end of the rectum. These vessels are occasionally of large size, and may give rise to troublesome haemorrhage when divided in the operation of lithotomy, or of fistula in ano. At the back part of this space may be seen a branch of the fourth sacral nerve ; and, at the fore part of the space, the superficial perineal vessels and neyves can be seen for a short distance.THE PERINiEUM T069 The Perineum in the Male The perineal s^Dace is of a triangular form ; its deep boundaries are limited, laterally, by the rami of the pubic bones and ischia, meeting, in front, at the pubic arch ; behind, by an imaginary transverse line, extending between the tuberosities of the ischia. The lateral boundaries are, in the adult, from three inches to three inches and a half in length ; and the base from two to three inches and a half in breadth ; the average extent of the space being two inches and three-quarters. The variations in the diameter of this space are of extreme interest in connection with the operation of lithotomy, and the extraction of a stone from the cavity of the bladder. In those cases where the tuberosities of the ischia are near together it would be necessary to make the incisions in the lateral operation of lithotomy less oblicxue than if the tube- rosities were widely separated, and the perineal space, consequently, wider. The peringeum is subdivided by the median raphe into two equal parts. Of these, the left is the one in which the operation of lithotomy is performed. In the middle line the perinaeum is convex, and corresponds to the bulb of the urethra. The skin covering it is of a dark colour, thin, freely movable upon the subjacent parts, and covered with sharp crisp hairs, which should be removed before the dissection of the part is commenced. In front of the anus a prominent line commences, the raphe, continuous in front with the raphe of the scrotum. Upon removing the skin and superficial structures from this region, in the manner shown in fig. 631, a plane of fascia will be exposed, covering in the triangular space and stretching across from one ischio-pubic ramus to the other. This is the deep layer of the superficial fascia oy fascia of Golles. It has already been described (page 438). It is a layer of considerable strength, and encloses and covers a space in which are contained muscles, vessels, and nerves. It is continuous, in front, with the dartos of the scrotum ; on each side, it is firmly attached to the margin of the ischio-pubic ramus and to the tuberosity of the ischium ; and posteriorly it curves down behind the Trans versus perinaei muscles to join the lower margin of the deep perineal fascia. It is between this layer of fascia and the next layer, the superficial layer of the deep perineal fascia, that extravasation of urine most frequently takes place in cases of rupture of the urethra. The superficial layer of the deep perineal fascia (see page 441) is also attached to the ischio-pubic rami, and in front to the subpubic ligament. It is clear, therefore, that when extravasation of fluid takes place between these two layers, it cannot pass backwards, because the two layers are continuous with each other around the Transversus perinaei muscles ; it cannot extend laterally, on account of the connection of both these layers to the rami of the os pubis and ischium ; it cannot find its way into the pelvis, because the opening into this cavity is closed by the deep perineal fascia, and, therefore, so long as these two layers remain intact, the only direction in which the fluid can make its way is forwards into the areolar tissue of the scrotum and penis, and from thence on to the anterior wall of the abdomen. When the deep layer of the superficial fascia is removed, a space is exposed, between this fascia and the deep perineal fascia, in which are contained most of the branches of the internal pudic artery, with their accompanying veins; the terminal branches of the internal pudic nerve; some of the muscles connected with the penis and urethra ;-r—in the middle line, the Accelerator urin£e ; on each side, the Erector penis; and behind, the Transversus perinaei;—the crura of the corpora cavernosa; and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum. Here also is seen the central tendinous 'point of the perincBum. This is a fibrous point in the middle line of the perinaeum between the urethra and the rectum, being about half an inch in front of the anus. At this point five muscles converge and are attached : viz. the External sphincter ani, the Acceleratores urinae, and the two Transversi perin^i muscles ; so that by the contraction of these muscles, which extend in opposite directions, it serves as a fixed point of support. The Accelerator urinae, the Erector penis, and the Transversus perinEei muscles have been already described (page 439). They form a triangular space, bounded, internally, by the Accelerator urinae ; externally, by the Erector penis; and behind, by the Transversus perinaei. The floor of this space is formed by the triangularSUEGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM loyo ligament of the urethra (deep X3erineal fascia) ; and running from behind forwards in it are the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, and the transverse perineal artery coursing along the posterior boundary of the space, on the Transversus perinaei muscle. The two terminal branches of the internal pudic artery are also to be seen in this space : the dorsal artery of the penis ascending between the crus and the pubic arch, and the artery to the corpus cavernosum entering the crus immedi- ately after the division of the parent trunk. The perineal nerve and dorsal nerve of the penis, the two terminal branches of the pudic nerve, are also contained in this space : the perineal dividing into muscular and cutaneous branches, and the dorsal nerve accompanying the dorsal artery along the ischio-pubic ramus, and with it piercing the suspensory ligament to be distributed to the penis. The Accelerator urinae and Erector penis should now be removed, when the deep perineal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb ; and on each side is the crus penis, connecting- the corpus cavernosum with the rami of the ischium and os pubis. Fig. 632.—The superficial muscles and vessels of the perinaeum. The deep perineal fascia (triangular ligament), which has already been described (see page 441), consists of two layers, the inferior or superficial layer of which, sometimes called the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, is now exposed. It is united to the superior or deep layer behind, but is separated in front by a subfascial space in which are contained certain structures. The superficial layer of the deep perineal fascia consists of a strong fibrous membrane, the fibres of which are disposed transversely, which stretches across from one ischio-pubic ramus to the other, and completely fills in the pubic arch ; it is attached in front to the subpubic ligament, except just in the centre, where a small interspace is left for the dorsal vein of the penis. In the erect position of the body it is almost horizontal. It is perforated by the urethra in the middle line, and on each side by the ducts of Cowper's glands. It is pierced also by several branches of the internal pudic artery, the dorsal artery of the penis near the apex of the ligament; the artery to the corpus cavernosum more posteriorly, close to the lateral margin of the ligament and the artery to the bulb in front of the opening for Cowper's duct. The dorsal nerve of the penis also passes through the ligament.COMPRESSOE URETHRA loyr in company with the artery of the same name. The crura penis are exposed, lying- superficial to this ligament. They will be seen to be attached by blunt pointed processes to the rami of the os pubis and ischium, in front of the tuberosities, and passing forwards and inwards joining to form the body of the penis. In the middle line is the bulb and corpus spongiosum exposed by the removal of the Accelerator urinse muscle. If the superficial layer of the deep perineal fascia is detached on either side, the deep perineal interspace will be exposed and the following parts will be seen, between it and the deep layer of the fascia : the subpubic ligament in front, close to the symphysis pubis ; the dorsal vein of the penis ; the membranous portion of the urethra and the Compressor urethrse muscle ; Cowper's glands and their ducts ; the pudic vessels and the dorsal nerve of the penis ; the artery and nerve of the bulb, and a plexus of veins. The stiperior^ or deep layer of the deep perineal fascia is derived from the obturator fascia, or is continuous with it along the pubic arch. Behind, it joins with the Fig. 633.—Deep perineal fascia. On the left side the anterior layer has been removed. superficial layer of the deep perineal fascia, and is continuous with the anal fascia. Above it is the recto-vesical fascia, separated from it on each side by the anterior fibres of the Levator ani, but in the median line these two layers of fascia are continuous and form a median septum, in consequence of the recto-vesical fascia dipping down to join the deep layer of the deep perineal fascia. Thus on each side of the middle line, beneath this fascia, is a little interspace in which is contained the anterior fibres of the Levator ani (Levator prostatae). It is bounded, below, by the deep layer of the deep perineal fascia; above, by the recto-vesical fascia, a.nd is separated internally from the space on the other side by the median septum. The deep layer of the deep perineal fascia is pierced by the urethra, and is continued backwards around the posterior part of the membranous portion of the urethra and the outer surface of the prostate gland. The Compressor urethrse has already been described (page 442 ). In addition to this muscle and immediately beneath it, circular muscular fibres surround the mem- branous portion of the urethra from the bulb in front to the prostate behind, and are continuous with the muscular fibres of the bladder. These fibres are involuntary.SUEGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM 1072 Cowper's glands are situated immediately below the membranous portion of the urethra, close behind the bulb and below the artery of the bulb. The pudic vessels and dorsal nerve of the penis are placed along the inner margin of the pudic arch (pages 606 and 803). The artery of the bulb passes transversely inwards, from the internal pudic along the base of the triangular ligament, between the two layers of fascia, accompanied by a branch of the pudic nerve (page 805). If the posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia is removed and the crus penis of one side detached from the bone, the under or perineal surface of the Levator ani is brought fully into view. This muscle, with the triangular ligament in front and the Coccygeus and Pyriformis behind, closes the outlet of the pelvis. The Levator ani and Coccygeus muscles have already been described (page 436).

The Prostate Gland is a pale, firm, glandular body which is placed immediately in front of the neck of the bladder, around the commencement of the urethra. It is placed in the pelvic cavity, behind and below the symphysis pubis, posterior to the deep ]perineal fascia, and rests upon the rectum, through which it may be distinctly felt, especially when enlarged. In shape and size it resembles a chestnut. Its base is directed backwards towards the neck of the bladder. Its apex is directed forwards to the deep perineal fascia, which it touches. Its under surface is smooth, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and rests on the rectum, to which it is connected by areolar tissue. Its upper surface is flattened, marked by a slight longitudinal furrow, and placed about three-quarters of an inch below the pubic symphysis. It measures about an inch and a half in its transverse diameter at the base, an inch in its antero-posterior diameter, and three-quarters of an inch in depth. Hence the greatest extent of incision that canSURGICAL ANATOMY 1073 be made in it without dividing its substance completely across, is obliquely back- wards and outwards. This is the direction in which the incision is made in it in the lateral operation of lithotomy. Behind the prostate is the posterior surface of the neck and base of the bladder : a small triangular portion of the bladder being seen, bounded, in front, by the prostate gland ; behind, by the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum ; on each side, by the vesicula seminalis and the vas deferens. It is separated from direct contact with the rectum by the recto-vesical fascia. The relation of this portion of the bladder to the rectum is of extreme interest to the surgeon. In cases of retention of urine this portion of the organ is found projecting into the rectum, between three and four inches from the margin of the anus, and may be easily perforated, without injury to any important parts ; this portion of the bladder is, consequently, occasionally selected for the performance of the operation of tapping the bladder. Surgical Anatomy.—The student should consider the position of the various parts in reference to the lateral operation of lithotomy. This operation is performed on the left side of the perinaeum, as it is most convenient for the right hand of the operation. A Fig. 635.—A transverse section of the pelvis, showing the pelvic fascia from behind. ischium staff having been introduced into the bladder, the first incision is commenced midway between the anus and the back of the scrotum (i.e. in an ordinary adult perinaeum, about an inch and a half in front of the. anus), a little on the left side of the raphe, and carried obliquely backwards and outwards to midway between the anus and tuberosity of the ischium. The incision divides the integument and superficial fascia, the inferior hsemor- rhoidal vessels and nerves, and the superficial and transverse perineal vessels. If the forefinger of the left hand is thrust upwards and forwards into the wound, pressing at the same time the rectum inwards and backwards, the staff may be felt in the membranous portion of the urethra. The finger is fixed upon the staff, and the structures covering it are divided with the point of the knife, which must be directed along the groove towards the bladder, the edge of the knife being turned outwards and backwards, dividing in its course the membranous portion of the urethra, and part of the left lobe of the prostate gland, to the extent of about an inch. The knife is then withdrawn, and the forefinger of the left hand passed alon^ the staff into the bladder. The position of the stone having been ascertained, the staff is to be withdrawn, and the forceps is introduced over the finger into the bladder. If the stone is very large, the opposite side of the prostate may be notched before the forceps is introduced: the linger is now withdrawn, and the blades of the forceps opened and made to grasp the stone, which must be extracted by slow and cautious undulating movements. 3ZI074 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERIX.EUM Parts divided in the Oj^eration.—The various structures divided in this operation are as follows :—the integument, superficial fascia, inferior haemorrhoidal vessels and nerves and probably the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, the posterior fibres of the Accele- rator urinte. the Transversus perintei muscle and artery, the deep permeal fascia, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani, part of the Compressor urethrse, the membranous and prostatic portions of the lu'ethra, and part of the prostate gland. Parts to he avoided in the Operation.—In making the necessary incisions in ihe peringeum for the extraction of a calculus, the following parts should be avoided. The primary incision should not be made too near the middle line, for fear of wounding the bulb of the corpus spongiosimi or the rectum : nor too far externally, otherwise the pudic artery may be imphcated as it ascends along the imier border of the pubic arch. If the incisions are carried too far forwards, the artery of the bulb may be divided ; if carried too far backwards, the entire breadth of the prostate and neck of the bladder may be cut through, which allows the urine to become infiltrated behind the pelvic fascia into the loose areolar tissue between the bladder and rectum, instead of escaping externally; diffuse inflammation is consequently set up, and peritonitis, fi'om the close proximity of the recto- vesical peritoneal fold, is the result. If, on the contrary, the prostate is divided in front of the base of the gland, the urine makes its way externally, and there is less danger of infiltration takmg place. Dui-ing the operation it is of great importance that the finger should be passed into the bladder hefore the staff is removed; if this is neglected, and if the incision made in the prostate and neck of the bladder is too smaU, great difiiculty may be experienced in introducing the finger afterwards ; and in the child, where the connections of the bladder to the sm-rounding parts are very loose, the force made in the attempt is sufficient to displace the bladder upwards into the abdomen, out of the reach of the operator. Such a proceeding has not imfrequently occurred, producing the most embarrassing results, and total failm^e of the operation. It is necessary to bear in mind that the arteries in the perinaeum occasionally take an abnormal course. Thus the artery of the biffb, when it arises, as sometimes happens, from the pudic opposite the tuber ischii, is liable to be wounded m the operation for lithotomy, in its passage forwards to the bulb. The accessory pudic may be divided near the posterior border of the prostate gland, if this is completely cut across ; and the prostatic veins, especially in people advanced in life, are of large size, and give rise, when divided, to troublesome haemorrhage. The Female Peeinjeum The female perinaeum presents certain differences from that of the male, in consequence of the whole of the structm'es which constitute it being perforated in the middle line by the vulvo-vaginal passage. The superficial fascia, as in the male, consists of two layers : of which the superficial one is continuous with the superficial fascia over the rest of the body ; and the deep layer, corresponding to the fascia of Colles in the male, is like it attached to the ischio-pubic ramus, and in front is continued forwards through the labia majora to the inguinal region. It is of less extent than the male, in consequence of being perforated by the aperture of the vulva. On remo\dng this fascia the muscles of the female perinaeum, which have already been described (page 442), are exposed. The Sphincter vaginae, corre- sponding to the Accelerator urin^e in the male, consists of an attenuated plane of fibres, forming an orbicular muscle around the orifice of the vagina, instead of being united in a median raphe, as in the male. The Erector clitoridis is propor- tionately reduced in size, bub differs in no other respect; and the Transversus perinsi is similar to the muscle of the same name in the male. The deep perineal fascia is not so strongly marked as in the male. It transmits the urethra, and is wide, separated in the median line by the aperture of the vagina. The Compressor ^JxQ^^nid^ {Transversus perincei profundus) is the analogue of the Compressor urethrae in the male. It arises from the ischio-pubic ramus, and, passing inw^ards, its anterior fibres blend with the muscle of the opposite side in front of the urethra ; its middle fibres, the most numerous, are inserted into the side of the vagina, and the posterior fibres join the central point of the perinaeum. The distribution of the internal pudic artery is the same as in the male (see page 607), and the pudic nerve has also a similar arrangement, the dorsal nerve being, however, very small and supplying the clitoris.PELVIC FASCIA 1075 The corpus spongiosum is divided into two lateral halves, which are represented by the hulhi vestihuli ^ndi partes intermediales (see jpage 1033). The perineal body fills up the interval between the lower part of the vagina and the rectum. Its base is covered by the skin lying between the anus and vagiiia on what is called the ' perinaeum.' Its anterior surface hes behind the posterior vaginal wall, and its posterior surface lies in front of the anterior rectal wall and the anus. It measures about an inch and a quarter from before backwards, and laterally extends from one tuberosity of the ischium to the other. In it are situated the muscles belongmg to the external organs of generation. Through its centre runs the transverse perineal septum, which is of great strength in women, and forms on either side, behind the posterior commissure, a hard, ill-defined body, consisting of connective tissue, with much yellow elastic tissue and interlacing bundles of involuntary muscular fibres, in which the voluntary muscles of the perineum are inserted. Fig. 636.—Side view of the peMc viscera of the male subject, showing the pelvic and perineal fasciae. Pelvic Fascia The Pelvic fascia (fig. 635) is a thin membrane which lines the whole of the cavity of the pelvis, and is continuous with the transversahs and iliac fasciae. It is attached to the brim of the pelvis, for a short distance, at the side of the cavity, and to the inner surface of the bone round the attachment of the Obturator internus. At the posterior border of this muscle, it is continued backwards as a very thin membrane in front of the Pyriformis muscle and sacral nerves to the front of the sacrum. In front, it follows the attachment of the Obturator internus to the bone, arches beneath the obturator vessels, completing the orifice of the obturator canal, and at the front of the pelvis is attached to the lower part of the symphysis pubis. At the level of a hne extending from the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the spine of the ischium, is a thickened whitish band; this marks the attachment of the Levator ani muscle to the peMc fascia, and corresponds to its point of division into two layers, the obturator and recto-vesical.SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM 1076 The obturator fascia descends and covers the Obturator internus muscle. It is a direct continuation of the pelvic fascia below the white line above mentioned, and is attached to the pubic arch and to the margin of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. From its attachment to the rami of the os pubis and ischium a process is given off which is continuous with a similar process from the opposite side, so as to close the front part of the outlet of the pelvis, forming the posterior layer of the triangular ligament. This fascia forms a canal for the pudic vessels and nerve in their passage forwards to the perineum, and gives off a thin membrane which covers the perineal aspect of the Levator ani muscle, called the iscliio-rectal {anal) fascia. The recto-vesical fascia {visceral layer of the pelvic fascia) descends into the pelvis upon the upper surface of the Levator ani muscle, and invests the prostate, bladder, and rectum. From the inner surface of the symphysis pubis a short rounded band is continued to the upper surface of the prostate and neck of the bladder, forming the pubo-prostatic or anterior true ligaments of the bladder. At the side, this fascia is connected to the side of the prostate, enclosing this gland and the vesico-prostatic plexus of veins, and is continued upwards on the side of the bladder, forming the lateral true ligaments of the organ. Another prolongation invests the vesiculae seminales, and passes across between the bladder and rectum, being continuous with the same fascia of the opposite side. Another thin prolongation is reflected round the surface of the lower end of the rectum. The Levator ani muscle arises from the point of division of the pelvic fascia; the visceral layer of the fascia descending upon and being intimately adherent to the upper surface of the muscle, while the under surface of the muscle is covered by a thin layer derived from the obturator fascia, called the ischio-rectal or anal fascia. In the female, the vagina perforates the recto-vesical fascia, and receives a prolongation from it.INDEX Abdomen, 896; apertures found in, 896; boundaries of, 896; lymphatics of, 670 ; muscles of, 425 ; regions of, 896 ; viscera of, 869 Abdominal aorta, 590; branches of, 591; surgical anatomy of, 591 ; surface marking of, 591 ; muscles, 425 ; ring ex- ternal, 427, 1048 ; internal, 1052 ; viscera, position of, 898 Abdomino-thoracic arch, 209 Abducent nerve, 753 ; surgical anatomy of, 754 Abductor indicis muscle, 474 Abductor minimi digiti muscle, (hand) 473, (foot) 511 Abductor pollicis muscle, 470 ; hallucis, 510 Aberrant duct of testis, 1027 Absorbent glands, 661 Absorbents, 661 Accelerator urinae muscle, 439 Accessorii orbicularis oris, 378 Accessorius ad ilio-costalem muscle, 413 Accessorius pedis, 511 Accessory ligament of shoulder, 321 ; obtu- rator nerve, 798; olivary nuclei, 694; descending palatine canals, 170; pudic artery, 606; processes, 122 Acervulus cerebri, 722 Acetabulum, 251 Acromatin, 7 Acromial end of clavicle, fracture of, 478 Acromial region, muscles of, 449 ; thoracic artery, 573 _ Acromio-clavicular joint, 317; surface form of, 319 ; surgical anatomy of, 319 Acromion process, 216; fracture of, 478 Actions of Muscles.

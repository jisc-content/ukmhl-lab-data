58 I THE HYOID BONE. Horse-shoe shaped, and suspended by stylo-hyoid ligaments from tips of styloid processes > of temporal bones. Consists in youth of five parts, the body and the greater & lesser ; cornua, which parts are joined together by four arthrodiae; the cornua usually join with i the body, the greater ones towards the middle period of life, the lesser ones in advanced age. BODY — Quadrilateral. Presents: Anterior Surface - Convex, looks upwards & forwards, and is marked by a crucial ridge. The part above the ridge gives attachment to the hyo-glossus, genio-hyo-glossus & genio-hyoid; the part below the ridge gives attachment to the mylo-hyoid, the stylo-hyoid & the aponeurosis of the digastric. Posterior Surface - Smooth, concave; looks backwards & downwards, and is sepa- rated from the epiglottis & the thyro-hyoid membrane by a quantity of loose : areolar tissue, in which a bursa is usually found. ( Upper Border - Thick & rounded; gives attachment to genio-hyo-glossus by its an- terior lip, to thyro-hyoid membrane by its posterior lip. Lower Border - Thinner; gives attachment to sterno-, omo-, & thyro-hyoid. GREATER CORNU — Projects backwards & slightly upwards, giving attachment super- iorly to the hyo-glossus, internally to the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and externally to the thyro-hyoid. It diminishes in size from before backwards, jj and is flattened from above downwards. Its slightly enlarged extremity gives jj attachment to the lateral thyro-hyoid ligament, jj LESSER CORNU — Small, conical; projects upwards & backwards from point of junctioit | of body & greater cornu, and gives attachment to the stylo-hyoid ligament. *

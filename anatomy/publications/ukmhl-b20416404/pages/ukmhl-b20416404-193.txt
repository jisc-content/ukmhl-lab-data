179 THEIR TRIBUTARY BRANCHES. Vertebral - Commences in deep mnscles of upper & back part of neck, and then accompanies vertebral artery through foramina in transverse processes of the vertobrsB from the atlas to the 6th, and opens into back part of innominate close to its origin, crossing, on the right side, the first part of the subclavian artery; its opening is guarded by a pair of valves. Sometimes double inferiorljg one of its trunks passing through small foramen in transverse process of 7th cervical vertebra. Receives Tkibutary Branches : - Dorsi-Spinal^ Meningo-Rachidianj Ascending Deep Cervical, Internal Mammary - Two to each artery. Accompany artery receiving corres- ponding branches, unite into one trunk at upper pare of thorax, and open into front of innominate. Inferior Thyroid - OnÂ© on each side, sometimes more. Commence in venous plexus upon thyroid gland, communicating with middle & superior thyroid; descend in front of trachea, communicating with each other by numerous transverse branches, and, inclining outwards beneath sterno-thyroid, open, the left one into middle of left innominate, the right one into termination of right innominate, their opening being guarded by a valve. Receive Teibutary Bkanches : - Tracheal 6^ Inferior Laryngeal, Superior Intercostal - The right one is smaller than the left, and closely corres. ponds to its artery. The left one, in addition to corresponding to its artery^g receives the intercostal veins from the two, three, or four first spaces, varying" in size in correspondence with the increased or diminished size of the le'ft superior azygos J it also receives the left bronchial vein. - These veins are occasionally seen to take a descending course, and to open into the vena azygos major. Vena Azygos Major - V. Spinal veins, 2ad Tablet. Thymic - \ Pericardiac > Small, irregular; open, most of them into left innominate or X superior cava, some into internal mammary. Mediastinal-;

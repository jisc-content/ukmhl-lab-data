202 LYMPHATICS of the LOWER LIMB. VESSELS — Are superficial & deep. Superficial - Arise from skin of foot, chiefly on dorsal aspect, and ascend npon leg dividing intotj Inner Set - The larger & more numerous. Ascend some in front of & some behinc internal malleolus, accompany internal saphenous vein along innei side of leg, behind inner condyle, & along inner aspect of thio:h, and opei: into the inferior or femoral group of inguinal lymphatic glands OuTEE Set - Smaller & less numerous. Some of them pass upwards & inwardi over front of leg, and, crossing the tibia, open into the inner set. Other ascend behind external malleolus with external or short saphenous vein accompany that vein along back of leg, and open into the popliteal glands Deep - Accompany the anterior & posterior tibial & peroneal vessels, and open into th( popliteal glands, the efferent vessels of which glands accompany the femora vessels and open into the deep inguinal glands. - The deep lymphatics of th( gluteal & ischiatic regions accompany the gluteal & sciatic vessels, and opei into the gluteal & sciatic glaudf • ;| GLANDS —Are superficial & deep. Superficial Inguinal Glands — Nine or ten in number, and divided into two groflptjjj Superior OR Abdominal Group - The smaller, placed transversely near Poupart'i ligament; receive the superficial lymphatics of the penis, scrotum (o labia), perinseum, lower part of the abdomen, & butfcocli Inferior or Femoral Group - The larger, vertically disposed round upper parte saphenous vein; receive the superficial lymphatics of the lower liml Their efferent vessels join the deep inguinal glands & the small glam which is found in the femoral canal Deep Glands - Are the: I Anterior Tibial - Not constant; frequently one or two in front of upper part c- interosseous membrane by side of anterior tibial artery; receive the an terior tibial lymphatic; Popliteal - Four or five, imbedded in cellular tissue of popliteal space; receiv posterior tibial & peroneal lymphatics, and the lymphatics which accom pany the external saphenous veil Deep Inguinal - A few small glands accompany the femoral vessels, and coffl municate with the superficial inguinal glands through the saphenon opening of the fascia lati Gluteal & Sciatic - Lie opposite great sacro-sciatic foramen, the former above, tb latter below the pyriformis muscle; they receive the correspondin lymphatic vessels, and their efferent vessels open into the internal ili« gland

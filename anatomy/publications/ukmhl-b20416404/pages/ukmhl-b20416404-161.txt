147 COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. Eight common carotid arises from innominate artery behind steno-clavicular articulation. Left common carotid arises from highest part of arch of Aorta, is longer, and has a thora- cic portion deeply situated within the thorax. THORACIC PORTION OP THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ART. Upwards & outwards to root of neck. — RELATIONS : In Front — Sternum, sterno-hyoid & -thyroid, left innominate v., re- mains of thymus gland. Behind — Trachea, CESophagus, thoracic duct. On Inner Side — Innominate artery. On Outer Side — Left pneumogastric & phrenic ns. & left subclavian art., left lung & pleura. CERVICAL PORTION OF THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. Upwards & outwards from behind sterno-clavicular articulation to upper border of thyroid cartilage, where divides into external & internal carotid arta. Direction from sternal end of clavicle to midway between angle of jaw & mastoid pr. In same sheath of deep cervical fascia as int. jugular v. & pneumogastric n. Deeply situated at origin; superficial at termination. — EELATIONS: In Front, Lower part — Skin, superf f., platysma, ant. jugular v., deep f; Sterno-mastoid, -hyoid, -thyroid, omo-hyoid, middle thyr. v. Upper part — Skin, superf. f. platysma, deep f, inner border of sterno-mastoid. Sterno-mastoid art., facial, lingual & sup, thyroid veins, descendens noni n. Behind — Cervical vertebra, longus colli, rectus capitis anticus major, inf thyroid artery, sympathetic & recurrent laryngeal ns. On Inner Side — Trachea, thyroid gland, larynx, pharynx; iuferior thy- roid art., recurrent laryngeal n. On Outer Side — Internal jugular vein, pneumogastric n. — At lower part of neck int. jugular v. diverges from artery on right side, approaches and crosses it on left side. External carotid artery From upper border of thyroid cartilage to interval between neck of condyle & external audi- tory meatus, where divides into temporal & internal maxillary. At its origin it is more superficial & nearer middle line than int. carotid. — RELA- TIONS : Covered by — Skin, superficial f, platysma, deep f., ant. border of sterno-mastoid; Lingual & facial veins, hypoglossal n., digastric & stylo-hyoid ms. Parotid gl., facial n., junction of temporal & internal maxillary vs. On Inner Side — Wall of pharynx, portion of parotid gland, sup. laryngeal n. Behind —Sup. laryngeal n., stylo-glossus & -pharyngeus, glosso-pharyngeal n., in- ternal carotid art. BRANCHES: Superior Thyroid, Lingual, Facial; Occipital, Post. Auricular; — Ascending Pharyngeal; Temporal, Int. Maxillary.

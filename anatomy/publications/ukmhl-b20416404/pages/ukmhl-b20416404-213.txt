199 LiYMPHATICS of the UPPER LIMB- VESSELS. Superficial - Arise from skin of hand. Eun along sides of fingers, chiefly on dorsal aspect, and ascend along forearm dividing into: Inner Set - The more numerous. Accompany ulnar veins, and, at bend of elbow receive greater part of following set and open into superficial glandSj when such glands exist j they then accompany basilic vein and open into axillary glands. Outer Set - The less numerous. Accompany radial vein to bend of elbow, where greater part join foregoing ; the rest accompany cephalic vein, some crossing biceps obliquely to end in axillary glands, others continuing between pectoralis major & deltoid to end in subclavian glands. Deep - Accompany radial, ulnar, & interosseous arteries, passing through glands occa- sionally found along these arteries, and communicating at intervals with super- ficial lymphatics. They then pass through glands on inner side of brachial artery, and through axillary & subclavian glands, and open, on left side into thoracic duct, on right side into right lymphatic duct. GLANDS. Superficial - Not constant} occasionally two or three small ones at bend of elbow, and one or two just above inner condyle. Deep - May be divided into: Eadial I _ -^^^ constant. Occasionally two or three small ones along corresponding Ulnar ) arteries. Brachial - Form a chain of small glands-along inner side of artery. Axillary - Ten or twelve, much larger. Lie : - /. Round axillary vessels^ - receive lymphatics of upper limb; 2. Along lower border of pectoralis majors - receive lymphatics from front of chest & mamma; 3. Along lower border of teres major <2rÂ» latissimus dorsi, - receive lymphatics from integument of back. Subclavian - Two or three, beneath clavicle; connect axillary glands to deep glands of neck.

122 SHORT POSTERIOR CRANIO-VERTEBRAL MUSCLES. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major - Spinous process of axis. Into and beneath outer part of inferior curved line of occipital bone. Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor - Tubercle on posterior arch of atlas. Into and beneath inner part of inferior curved line of occipital bone. Obliquus Capitis Inferior - Spinous process of axis. Extremity of transverse process of atlas. Oblquus Capitis Superior - Extremity of transverse process of atlas. Occipital bone between the two curved lines externally to the complexusA rectus capitis posticus major. These muscles are supplied by the posterior branch of the subocoipita! nerve; the inferior oblique is also supplied by the great occipital SMALL MUSCLES of the SPINOUS & TRANSVERSE! PROCESSES. I Supraspinales - Small fleshy fasciculi which lie on the cervical spinous processes. j Interspinales - Short fleshy fasciculi placed in pairs between the spinous processes of | the adjoinng vertebrae. - There are six pretty distinct pairs corresponding to tlie j} six lower cervical vertebras; four pairs corresponding to the lumbar vertebrasj sometimes two or three rather indistinct pairs corresponding to the upper and lower dorsal vertebrae. Intransversales - Short fleshy fasciculi which lie between the transverse processes of the adjoining vertebrae. - Are most developed in the cervical region, where they form seven pairs; they are tendinous in the upper part of the dorsal region; muscular, but single in lumbar region & in lower part of dorsal. These muscles are supplied, the two former by the internal, the latter by the external branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical dorsal & lumbar nerves.

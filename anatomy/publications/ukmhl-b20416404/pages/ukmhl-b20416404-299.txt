281 HE TEETHâ€”1st Tablet. Temporary Set - Twenty: Four incisors^ two canines, four molars, in each jaw. Permanent Set - Thirty-lwo: Four incisors, two canines, four bicuspids, six molars, in each jaw. The upper dental arch describes a wider curve than the lower one. This is due partly to the somewhat wider curve of the superior alveolar arch, and partly to the implanta- tion of the teeth: The teeth of the upper jaw are inclined forwards in front and outwards behind; those of the lower jaw are vertical in front, and inclined slightly inwards behind. Owing to the greater breadth of the two upper central incisors, the teeth of the upper jaw are somewhat external or posterior to those of the lower jaw : They come in contact partly with the corresponding tooth below, and partly with the one next following; the cusps of the upper molars lie a little behind the corresponding cusps of the lower molars. Since, however, the upper molars, especially the wisdom teeth, are smaller than those below, the dental arches terminate behind nearly at the same point in both jaws. A tooth presents: - Crown - Projecting above the gum. - The crowns diminish slightly in height from the incisors to the last molar, - those of the canines, which project beyond the level of all the other teeth, being excepted. Hoot or FaXlg - implanted into the alveoli. The alveolus is lined with a periosteum, the periodental membrane, which is continuous above with the fibrous structures of the gum. Neck - Constricted portion between the crown and the fang.

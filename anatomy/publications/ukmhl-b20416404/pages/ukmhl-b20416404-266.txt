248 TABLEAU of the CRANIAL NERVES. First or Olfactory - Arises by three roots \ ^ ^ ^ . ^ _ ^1 Ext. or Long Root - From posterior border of fissure of Sylvius. . - Jnt. or Short Root - From posterior & inner part of anterior lobe. Middle or Grey Root - From caruncula mammillaris. - Presents olfactory process, olfactory bulb, terminal branches. Second or Optic - From anterior &>posterior quadrigeniinal and internal &^ external geniculate bodies J and optic thalamus. - Presents optic tract, optic commissure or chiasma, & optic nerve proper. Third or Motor Oculi-From inner border of crus cerebri just in front of Pons Varolii,- Supplies all the muscles of the orbit except superior oblique & external rectus, and gives off motor root to lenticular ganglion. Fourth, Trochlearis or PatheticUS - From upper part of valve of Vieussens. - Supplies superior oblique. Fifth, Trigeminal or Trifacial-Vide next Tableau* Sixth or AbducenS - From constricted part of corpus pyramidale close to pons Varolii or from lower border of ports itself. - Supplies external rectus* Facial or Portio dura of the 7th - From upper part of lateral tract of medulla Oblongata Itl groove between olivai-y & restiform bodies* Anastomoses - With atiditory, glosso-pharyngeal, piteumogastric, auriculo-temporal,great aurictdar; - also large, small, & external petrosal nerves join Meckel's d» Arnold's ganglia 6^ sympathetic^ Branches - Large, small, ^ external petrosal, tympanic, chorda tympanic posterior aurictdari muscular (to stylo-hyoid & posterior belly of digastric), temporo^ dr* cei-vico-faciaU Auditory or Portio Mollis of the 7th -■ From foor of 4<th ventricle, its fibres of origin forming the liiiece transversce, and also from the restiform body & perhaps from pons "Varolii. - Divides into vestibular & cochlear nerves. GlOSSO'pharyngeal - From lateral tract of medulla oblongata above pneumogastric. Presents two ganglia in anterior or inner part of jugular foramen, the superior or jugular, and the inferior or petrous. Anastomoses - "With pneumogastric & facial, and through Jacobson's nerve with carotid plexus and great small petrosal neives. Branches - Tympanic^ ca7'otid,pharyngeal, muscular (to stylo-pharyngeus & constric- tors), tonsillar, lingual. Pneumogastric - From lateral tract of medulla oblongata below glosso-pharyngeal ^ above spinal accessory. - Presents two ganglia,- superior or jugular, small, rounded, situated in jugular foramen,- inferior or petrosal, large, cylindrical, situated below the foramen. Anastomoses - "With facial, the two other branches of the Sth, hypoglossal, sympathetic, loop between the two first cervical nerves. BLANCHES Auricular,pharyngeal, superior laryngeal, inferior or recurrent laryngeal, cardiac, pubjionary, oesophageal gastric* Spinal Accessory - ACCESSORY PORTION - J'rom lateral tract of medulla oblongata below pneumogastric. Joins ptieilmogastric, and assists in forming the pharyngeal, superior & ,^ inferior laryngeal branches of the latter. ^ SPINAL PORTION - From lateral column of the cord as low as Bth or 6th cervical nei'ves.'* Enters skull through foramen magnumj leaves it through jugular fora* men in same sheath as pneumogastric, and supplies under surface of trapezius. Hypoglossal - Froni groove between anterior pyramid & olivary body by teti or twelve filaments, which form two bundles. Leaves skull through anterior condyloid foramen. Anastomoses ^ Witk pmcumogastric, sympathetic, two first cervical nerves & gustatory.

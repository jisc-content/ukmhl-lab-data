IS THE PARIETAL BONE Articulates with its fellow, the occipital, temporal, Gphenoid & frontal. - Presents: OUTER SURFACE — Convex, and presents: Parietalforamen at npper & back part j Parietal eminence; Temporal ridge^ below which it forms part of temporal fossa. INNER SURFACE — Concave, and presents: Cerebral eminences & depressions ; Furrows^ for ramifications of middle meningeal artery; Half-g7vove for superior longitudinal sinus & falx cerebri; Depressions for Pacchionian bodies. BORDERS - Four: Superior - Form sagittal suture by articulating with each other j Inferior - Are: In Front - Bevelled externally & overlapped by great wing of sphenoid & squamous portion of temporal;. Behind - Serrated for articulation with mastoid portion of temporal. Anterior - Serrated, and form coronal suture by articulating with frontal. Posterior - Serrated, and form lambdoid suture by articulating with occipital. ANGLES — Four: Anterior Superior & Posterior Superior - Correspond to anterior & ( posterior fontanelles, and form part of foregoing sutures. Anterior Inferior - Received between frontal & great wing of sphenoid, an inch above and behind superior external angle of orbit. - Is grooved internally and sometimes chanelled for anterior branch j of middle meningeal artery. ( Posterior Inferior - Articulates with mastoid portion of temporal, and pre- sents part of groove for lateral siuus.

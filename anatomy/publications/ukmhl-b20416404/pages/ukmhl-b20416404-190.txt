176 THE PLANTAR ARTERIES Brandies of bifurcation of posterior tibial beneath internal annular ligament & origin of al duotor pollicii INTERNAL PLANTAR - The smaller. Forwards between abductor pollicis & flexor brevis digitorum, and ends at extremity < first metatarsal bone in a small branch which runs along inner border of gre? toe, and joins with the corresponding plantar digital artery from communicatiiii branch of dorsalis pediii EXTERNAL PLANTAR - The larger. Outwards between flexor brevis digitorum & flexor accessorius, and then forwards h'\ tween former muscle & abductor minimi digiti as far as base of 5th metatarsi] bonl Bound outer border of flexor accessorius, and inwards upon interossei & bases of tt'' metatarsal bones,-beneath adductor pollicis, flexor tendons & lumbricales,-■ back of first interosseous space, where inosculates with communicating branc .i of dorsalis pedis, thus completing plantar araij branches: Posterior perforating —Three -Through back part of three outer intercj seous spaces, and inosculate with dorsal interosseous branches fro metatarsf Plantar interosseous (Digital) -—Four. Forwards upon interosseous spac (outermost crossing under surface of 5th metatarsal bone und cover of abductor & flexor brevis minimi digiti), and supply plant digital branches to 3^ toes on outer side of foot. The three innenno give off tl Akt. Pbejoeating arteries - Three. Through anterior part of thre outer interosseous spaces, and inosculate with the dorsal interc seous branches from metatarsal just before they bifurcate.

178 DESCENDING TRUNKS of FIRST ORDER. INNOMINATE VEINS — Two large trunks formed by junction of internal jugular A ]1 subclavian behind corresponding sterno-clavicular articulation. |1 RIGHT INNOMINATE — An inch & a half long, somewhat smaller than the left, and nearly vertical. Lies superficial & external to innominate artery, and is separated externally from right lung by right phrenic nerve & pleura. Joins with left innominate just below cartilage of 1st rib to form superior cava. Receives; Right Lympliatic Duct - At its origin, in angle of junction between right subclavian vein & right internal jugular. Tributary Cranclies: - Right Vertebral^ internal Ma?nmary^ Inferior Thy' roidi &^ Superior Intercostal. LEFT INNOMINATE — Three inches long, & somewhat larger than the right. Descends obliquely from behind left sterno-clavicular articulation to ! just below 1st costal cartilage of right side, lying in front of innominate, left common carotid & subclavian arteries, and behind sterno-hyoid & -thyroid muscles, remains of thymus gland, & sternum. Receives ^ Tributary Branches : Irft Vertebral, internal Mammary^ Inferior Thyroid^ | Superior Intercostali and sometimes some small Thymic Pericardiac ' Veins. - The innominate veins have no valves, i SUPERIOR VENA CAVA — short thick trunk (2^ to 3 inches long), slightly curved, & convex to the right. Descends vertically along right side of ascending portion of arch of aorta & in front of root of right lung from just below 1st costal cartilage of right side, enters fibrous bag of pericardium about an inch and a half above the heart, becomes invested anteriorly by serous layer on the same bag, and opens into upper & front part of right auricle; is separated externally from right Inng by right phrenic nerve & pleura, and its anterior relations are the same as those of the innominate. - Receives Tributary Branches ; - Vena Azygos Ma/orj &nd some svasdl Pericardiac & Mediastinal Veins* - Has no valves.

98 ARTICULATIONS of the FOOT Are tarsal^ tarso-metatarsal, metatarso-metatarsal, metafarsO'phalangeal ^phalangeal. TARSAL ARTICULATIONS — Form three sets: - Articulations of Bones of First Row. Astragalus & Os Calcis are joined by two arthrodial articulations, of which the ligament ir Interosseous Calcaneo-Astragaloid - Broad thick band of vertical & oblique fibres passing from th .e grooye on one bone to the deep groove on the other. It is the principal bond of ic External Calcaneo-Astragaloid - Short thick band from outer surface of astragalus below its t< nal articular facet to outer surface of os Ic Posterior Calcaneo-Astragaloid-^\amx.^x\>^Vi^^vQxn. posterior surface of astragalus to contiguoi] 3a of upper surface of os lie Articulations of Bones of Second Row. Scaphoid, Cuboid & the Three Cuneiform Bones are joined by arthrodial articulatr j, Dorsal _ ;^urnerous, irregular; the dorsal are the thickest & strongest. "^^'^^ ^^^^ j*' Plantar j ' » ' » \ Interosseous - Four, strong; connect adjacent non-articular portions of the three cuneiform on & the cuboid, and of the scaphoid & «)o Articulations of the First Row of Bones with the Second Row of Bones. The Astragalus & the Scaphoid, on the one hand, and the Os Calcis & the Cuboid, t other, are joined by two arthrodial articulations, of which the ligamei ,ai Sup. Astragalo-Scaphoid-Broa.d^ thin; from upper surf, of neck of astragalus to upper surf, of sc; loi Siip- CVz/f^zwif^^-Cwi^c/a'-Thin & narrow band joining os calcis & cuboid on their superior external jei Long Calcaneo-Cuboid - Long broad & strong band from under surf, of os calcis between t ai & the two post, tubercles, to ridge on under surface of cuboid & to base of 2ud 3r % 4 metatarsal bones. - It transforms the groove for peroneus longus into a complete im Short Calcaneo-Cuboid - Short broad & strong band, which underlies foregoing, and which < en from anterior tubercle & groove on under surface of os calcis to under surface of bo behind peroneal 30i Int. or Interosseous Calcaneo-Cuboid-Short thick band from upper & inner part of greater proct of calcis to inner side of cuboid. Blends posteriorly with the sup. calcaneo-scaph( li; To the foregoing ligaments must be added the two following, which may i co sidered, especially the latter one, as belonging to the astragalo-scaphoid artic ,tic Superior Calcaneo-ScapJioid - Short thick band blended posteriorly with foregoing, and m\ forwards anteriorly to outer side of sc hoi Inferior Calcaneo-Scaphoid - Very thick, strong, broad, and somewhat triangular band ex idii from anterior border of lesser process of os calcis to under surface of scaph( . supports the head of the astragalus, and forms part of the articular cavity inti rhii the latter is received; it is lined superiorly by the synovial membrane which coi mon to the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid & astragalo-scaphoid artici tioi TARSO-METATARSAL ARTICULATIONS — Are arthrodial joints between : First Metatarsal Bone and Internal Cuneiform; Second Metatarsal Bone „ All Three Cuneiform Bones, which bones form t eth a deep recess into which the second metatarsal bone is re ive( Third Metatarsal Bone and External Cuneiform ; Fourth Metatarsal Bone „ External Cuneiform (usually) & Cuboid; Fifth Metatarsal Bone „ Cuboid. - The ligaments are: Z>i7r^a/- Thick; join each metatarsal bone to corr esponding tarsal bone, the second me iars bone having three dorsal ligaments, one from each cui forr P/aw^ar - Thinner & less regular, especially those belonging to the 4th & 5th metatarsa lone Those belonging to the 1st & 2nd are much stronger ; those belonging to the 2d '& 3i are strengthened by oblique bands passing forwards from the internal cu ifon Interosseotis - Three, strong; between internal cuneiform & 2nd metatarsal bone, and 5we( external cuneiform & 2nd & 3rd metatars£ )one METATARSO-METATARSAL ARTICULATIONS — The metatarsal bones are conn led each other, both at their tarsal & at their digital exti aitie Taesal Extremities - Are connected by arthrodial a' ticulations, except in the case of )lst Dorsal 2nd metatarsal bs., between which there is no direct contact. Tdelig are Palmar C - Of which the interosseous are the strongest & most important, and th dors Interosseous } the least in )rtaii Digital Extremities - Are all joined together by the Transverse Metatarsal Ligament - Transverse band which crosses whole width of metatar J,_ar blends anteriorly with the glenoid ligaments of the metatarso-phalangeal artic ition METATARSO-PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS—Are condyloid articulations simi totl Anterior or Glenoid ( Cruveilhier) \ . metacarpo-phalangeal. The ligts. are also sin:i|ar,vii Lateral - Two for each. \ - Vide Metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. | PHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS — Are ginglymoid articulations similar to those of th |.nger The ligaments are the same as those of the foregoing artic itw^ For Synovial Membranes of the Tarsus, Vide next Tablet. 1

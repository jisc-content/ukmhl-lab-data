9 THE COCCYX Consists of four, sometimes of five, occasionally only of three vertebrae, which vertebree are both incomplete and more or less rudimentary: - incomplete^ for they are all deficient in pedicles, laminae & spinous processes, and consequently also in spinal canal & inter- vertebral foramina: - more or less rudimentary^ for the transverse & articular processes are distinguishable only in the first two or three vertebrae; the one or two last verte- brae are therefore reduced to mere nodules of bone. The First Coccygeal Vertebra is the largest & broadest. It articulates above with the last sacral vertebra by means of the oval & concave upper surface of its body. Its transverse processes project outwards, deepening the notch for the anterior division of the 5th sacral nerve, somtimes even transforming that notch into a complete foramen by curving upwards and articulating with the lateral margin of the sacrum. Its supenor articular processes are prolonged upwards into the cornua, which cornua articulate with the cornua of the sacrum. The Three Lower Coccygeal Vertebra diminish in size from above down- wards. They are usually joined to each other in the adult, the primitive lines of separation between them being marked by slight transverse furrows; but up to the middle period of life the second coccygeal vertebra is frequently found separated from the first one. At a more advanced age all the four bones become fused into one, which, at a still later period, especially in the male, is frequently joined to the sacrum. The coccyx gives attachment to the coccygeus, gluteus maximus, levator ani & external sphincter muscles, and to the greater & lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments.

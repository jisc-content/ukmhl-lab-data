THE THORACIC & RIGHT LYMPHATIC DUCTS. THORACIC DUCT — Commences in receptaculum chyli, passes throngh aortic opening o diaphraofm, and then ascends in front of spine as high as 4th dorsal vertebra^Myiu; behind oesophagus, between aorta & vena azygos major. It then inclines to the left and ascends first behind arch of aorta and then behind first portion of subclaviat artery of left side; and finally, opposite upper border of 7th cervical vertebra, it arche; forwards above pleura & in front of scalenus anticus, and opens into angle of junotior between left internal jugular & subclavian veins, its opening being guarded by a paii of valves. It is somewhat tortuous in its course, constricted at intervals on accoun of the valves it contains; of the size of a goose-quill at its commencement, somewha narrower in the thorax, again enlarged at the root of the neck. Sometime it bifurcates, its left division taking the usual course, its right division joinini the right lymphatic duct. - It is the common trunk of all the lymphatics of the bodj except those of the right side of the head, neck, & thorax, right upper lirab. righ lung, right side of the heart, & part of the convex surface of the liver Receptaculuni Chyli - is a dilatation of the commencement of the thoracic duct which liea in front of the 2nd lumbar vertebra, behind & to right side of th aorta, and between it and the vena azygos major & the right crus of th diaphragm. It receives the trunks of the lacteal vessels, and four or fiv large trunks from the lumbar lymphatic glandi KIGHT LYMPHATIC DUCT — is a short thick trunk from half an inch to an inon ii length and of about a line or a line & a half in diameter, which collects the lympl from the right side of the head, neck, & thorax, right upper limb, right lung, righ side of the heart, & part of the convex surface of the liver. It opens into the angli of junction between the right internal jugular & right subclavian veins, its opeainj being guarded by a pair of valves

290 STRUCTUKE of the TEETH,â€”6th Tablet. THE PULP Soft, vascular, sensitive. fl Consists of jelly-like connective tissue with fine fibres of white fibrous tissue, caudal anastomosing nucleated cells, blood-vessels, & nerves. The superficial cells are termed odontoblasts. They are elongated perpendicular to the surface of the pulp, and their superficial processes, of which several may arii from one cell, are prolonged into the dentinal tubules. They are joined to eati other by lateral processes, and to the deeper cells by radical processes. - Throug;! being more or less adherent to the dentine, they are sometimes described as f ormiBj the me77ibrana eboris. i The arteries are from the inferior dental, and from the alveolar & infraorl branches of the internal maxillary. The nerves are from the inferior dental branch of the inferior maxillary division and from the anterior & posterior dental branches of the superior maxillary divisi<ill of the fifth. Towards the surface of the pulp, they are said to end in fine nol* modulated fibres which enter the dentinal tubules with the processes of wj odontoblasts.

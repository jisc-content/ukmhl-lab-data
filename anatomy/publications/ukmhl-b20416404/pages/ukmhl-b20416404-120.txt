Inserted into this muscle and into the integument covering it from the middle of the upper lip to the middle of the lower lip, are the following muscles (the last excepted), which all blend more or less with each other : - Levator Labii Superioris Alseque Nasi - Upper part of nasal process of superioi maxilla.

Risorius - Fascia over parotid gland & masseter. - Is often described a3 the upper par|' of platysma myoides. Depressor Anguli Oris or Triangularis Oris - External oblique line of lower jaTji externally to mental foramen. Depressor Labii Inferioris or Quadra tus Menti - External oblique line of loweii jaw between symphysis & mental foramen.

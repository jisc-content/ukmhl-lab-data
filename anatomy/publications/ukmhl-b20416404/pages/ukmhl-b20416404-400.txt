10 371-^ Tenon^s Capsule, or Tunica Vaginalis Oculi, The old description of Tenon's capsule has recently been revived in a modified form by Schwalbe and by the Editors of the 8th Edition of " Quain'a Anatomy" : - This capsule would con- sist of two membranous layers lined with flattened epithelioid cells; and these layers would enclose a lymph-space which would communicate with the lymph.space between the sclerotic & choroid. This capsule separates the eyeball from the fat of the orbit, and enables it to glide freely on the surrounding structures. The tendons of the recti & obliqui muscles perforate the capsule in front, to reach-the sclerotic.

'86 THE ELBOW-JOINT Is a ginglymoid articulation between the trochlea & the radial tuberosity or capitellum of the humerus, on the one hand, and, on the other, the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna & the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius. - The articular surfaces of the radius & ulna are continuous with those of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. LIGAMENTS -Are: Anterior - Broad & pretty thick layer of superficial oblique & deeper vertical fibres extending from Inner condyle 6^ front ofJiiwierus just above coronoid fossa to Orbicular ligamentof radiiis ^ under surface of coronoid process ofulna^ - to which vertical & oblique fibres a few transverse ones are added. Posterior - Thin & membranous j consists of a few irregular fibres mainly trans- verse, which connect Apex 6^ sides of olecranon process to Margin of olecranon fossa. External Lateral - Thick, strong, triangular, shorter & narrower than the internal; from External condyle to Orbicular ligament of radius 6^ outer border of ulna. Internal Lateral - Thick, strong, triangular; longer «fe broader than foregoing, and divided into anterior & posterior portions extending respectively from Front, and from lower 6^ back part of inner condyle^ respectively to Inner border of coronoid process, and inner border of olecranon. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE — Lines the coronoid & olecranon fossee, and dips down be- tween the articular surfaces of the superior radio-ulnar articulation. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY - From the superior & inferior profunda, & the radial, ulnar & interosseous recurrent arteries, and from the ulnar & musculo-cutaneous ^ nerves. MOVEMENTS — T'lexion & extension only, which are limited by the locking of the coronoid & olecranon processes in their respective fossae. - The inner border of the trochlea descending lower than the outer one, the axis of rotation is oblique downwards & inwards; the path of motion lieSj therefore, in a plane, oblique downwards & out- wards, which circumstance, as is remarked by Cruveilhier, brings the hand during flexion naturally and without efibrt towards the mouth.

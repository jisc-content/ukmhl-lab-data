343 rHE SPERMATIC CORD Conaista of the portion of the vas deferens which extends from the testicle to the internal ab- dominal ring, and of the accompanying arteries, veins, lymphatics, & nerves and contains the vas aberrans & the organ of Giraldes. These structures are bound together by delicate areolar tissue, and are invested from within outwards by: Tunica vaginalis^ below j Fascia propria^ along the whole Cramasteric fascia^ along nearly the whole of the course of the cord; Intercolumnar fascia^ dartos & skin of the scrotum^ below the external abdominal ring. Vas deferens - Lies at the back. Arteries - Are the spermatic^ the artery of the vas deferens from the superior vesical, and the cremasteric branch of the epigastric. Veins - Are the spermatic veins, which pass up in front of the vas deferens, forming the pampiniform plexus^ and then unite in a single trunk, which accompanies the abdomi- nal portion of the spermatic artery and terminates in the left renal vein, on the left side, in the inferior vena cava, on the right. Lymphatics - Terminate in the lumbar glands. Nerves - Are the ilio'inguinoly the genital branch of the genito-crural, frequently a branch of the ilio-hypogastric, and the spermatic plexus of the sympathetic, which latter is derived from the renal, aortic & hypogastric plexuses. Vas Aberrans (Haller) -a narrow tortuous tube from \\ to 14 inches long, connected with the commencement of the vas deferens or with the lower part of the canal of the epididymis, and passing upwards for 1 or 2 inches among the other vessels ot the spermatic cord. It ends in a blind extremity, and is sometimes unconnected with the seminal ducts. It was probably connected in the foetus with the Wolffian body. Organ of Giraldes - a collection of minute convoluted tubules, probably a remnant ot the WolflBlan body, found in the lower & front part of the cord close to the head of the epididymifc

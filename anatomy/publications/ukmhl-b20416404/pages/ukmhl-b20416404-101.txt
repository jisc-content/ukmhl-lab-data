87 PHE WBIST-JOINT Is a condyloid articulation. ARTICULAR SURFACES: The Condyle - Is formed by three bones, the scaphoid, semilunar, & cuneiform. The Receiving Cavity - Is formed by the under surface of the radius & by the trian- gular fibro-cartilage of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. - The under sur- face of the radius is divided by a linear elevation into two portions, the outer * triangular, the inner quadrilateral, which portions correspond respectively to the scaphoid and the semilunar; the cuneiform articulates with the under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage. LIGAMENTS: External Lateral - Short strong band, from A/>ex of styloid process of radms to Outer side of scaphoid trapezium, ^ anterior annular li^mnent of carpus. Internal Lateral - Round cord, from Apex of styloid process of ulna to Cuneiform dr* pisiform bones, dr' anterior annular ligament. Anterior -Strong & broad membrane, from Front of head of ulna, anterior margin of radius (2r» its styloid process to Scaphoid, semilunar, cuneiform, slightly to os magnum. Posterior - Thinner, from Posterior margin of radius to Scaphoid, semilunar cuneiform. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — Anterior & posterior carpal branches of radial & ulnar, anterior & posterior interosseous arteries, ascending branches of deep palmar arch. - Ulnar nerve. MOVEMENTS — All but rotation.

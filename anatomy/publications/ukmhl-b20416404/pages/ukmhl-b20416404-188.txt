ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY Anterior & smaller branch of bifurcation of popliteal opposite lower border of poplitem i mnscle Forwards between the two heads of tibialis posticus, and between tibia & fibula througl; opening in upper part of interosseous ligament' Downwards in front of interosseous ligament, shaft of tibia & ankle joint ( where becomei dorsalis pedis), passing between tibialis anticus & extensor longus digitortun between tibialis anticus & extensor proprius pollicis, between tendon of extensor pro ' prius pollicis, which crosses it, and innermost tendon of extensor longus digitormn >- lying in a line from inner side of head of fibula to midway between malleoli, anc being deeply situated, above, between muscles on either side & beneath tendon o. extensor proprius pollicis, and superficially, below, beneath skin, anterior annnla ligament & fascia Has two venae comites. Anterior tibial nerve is first external, then anterior then again external to it BRANCHES : Recurrent tibial — Arises in upper part of leg. Upwards through tibialis anticn to front of knee, and anastomoses with inf. articular branches of poplitea Muscular — Numerous small branches to muscles on either side. Malleolar — Two; rather variable in size. Arise near ankle, and pass, the Internal, - To inner ankle beneath tendons of extensor proprius pollicis & tibia lis anticus External, - To outer ankle beneath extensor longus digitorum, and anastomose respectively with posterior tibial & internal planta and with tarsal & peronea DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY From bend of ankle to back of first interosseous space, resting upon bones of tarsus b( tween tendon of extensor proprius pollicis & innermost tendon of extensor brer digitorum, which crosses it near termination, and having anterior tibial nerve on i outer sid , BRANCHES: | Tarsal — Arches outwards beneath extensor brevis digitorum, and anastomoses wit metatarsal, external malleolar & external planta ; Metatarsal — More or less obliquely forwards in front of preceding. Gives off t^: Three outer Dorsal Interosseous Arteries - Along corresponding interosseoii; spaces. Are joined by anterior & posterior perforating branches, ai; supply dorsal digital branches to 3^ toes on outer side of foolj Dorsal Art, of Great Toe — is the first dorsal interosseous artery, and suppli«j| dorsal digital branches to 1^ toes on inner side of focj, CominUllicating — Between the two heads of first dorsal interosseous muscle, arji inosculates with external plantar, completing plantar arch. Gives ( plantar digital branches to 1^ toes on inner side of foot

Is a broad triangular depression Situated at upper, inner, & front part of thigh; Botmded by Poupart's ligament, sartorius & adductor longus; Continued downwards inwards into a superficial furrow, which marks position of temoral artery in {5'.n^?r-!f i^*""" without inwards by iliacus, psoas, pectineus, & small part of adductor bre^l"*^'''^ "^"^ It contams femoral vessels & anterior crural nerve, and the «uui,uui: uiovib. PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA - These parts are:- SKIN — Thin, freely movable, more or less studded with hairs at upper & inner part. SUPERFICIAL FASCIA — Divided into two layers by superficial vessels & nerves & inguinal SUPERFICIAL LAYER - Thick, areolar, contains a large amount of fat, and il^c^Kunuol^with subcutaneous tissue of surrounding regions; is rather thinner & less loaded with fat DEEP LAYER - Thin & membranous. Adherent superiorly to P^^rt'''stSes over saphenous openmg under the name of " cridri/orm fascia," which fascia is per- forated by internal saplienous vein & by numerous smaller blood & lymphatic vessels, and IS attached firmly to outer margin of the opening, & slightly to the inner margin. Superficial Vessels & Nerves and Lymphatic Glands - Are the: Internal saphenous vein ; Superficial epigastric, siiperficial circuntjiex iliac, superficial external pndic arteries Vfiih the correspondmg veins, which latter op4 into internal sShenous neaMts Ilio-ing,unal crural Wanch of genito-crural, <S- external cutaneous nerves. ' I^ymphatic glands - Form two groups. Those of the "^^^ smaller, and are placed transversely near Poupart s ligament; - they receive lymphatics of penis, scrotum, perina;um ,,f . r y , lower part of abdomen & buttock;-those of the ■^Z'Z^^'' ■^T'T^ C""'^ ~ the larger, and are vertically disposed round upper part of saphenous vein ; - they receive the lymphatics of lower limb. DEEP FASCIA or FASCIA LATA .- Dense, fibrous. Presents the saphenous opening for easier descnptiou of which it is usually divided into two portions, the iliac & the pubic ILIAO PORTION - The thicker. Attached to crest of iiium, Poupart's ligament & spine of pubes in'?P n/*^ downwards & outwards from this latter point, first bounding the superior angle, or sTiperw?-cor7m of the opening, then forming its outer margin This outer margin is the Jalctform process of Burns; its upper part is often called Hey's femoral (^v ;7f Superiorly this margin overlies the sheath of the femoral vessels.

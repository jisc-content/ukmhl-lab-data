136 STEUCTURE of the HEART-lst Tablet. Presents for examination the fibrous rings of the arterial & anricalo.ventricular openingr and the musoalar fibret FIBHOUS RINGS — The aortic & the two auriculo-ventricular rings lie close together behinc the centre of the sternum on a level with the 3rd costal cartilages, and are bounc together by a fibro-cartilagiaous mass which becomes ossified in some of the large animals. - The aortic ring lies in front of the left auriculo-ventricular; the rigli auriculo-ventricular ring lies between, & to the right of, the two others. - The fibrou ring of the pulmonary artery is situated at the apex of the infundibulam opposite th upper border of the 3rd costal cartilage of the left side close to the sternum. These rings give attachment to the mitral .tricuspid & semilunar valves, to th muscular fibres of the auricles, and to some of the most superficial fibres of the ven tricles. The margin of the arterial rings which is turned towards the auricles,] scalloped into three semilunar notches filled up by corresponding projections of th middle coat of the artery, the attachment of the arteries to the rings being strength ened externally by the pericardium and internally by the endocardiaa MUSCULAR FIBRES — -A-re striated, but are about ^ smaller than those of striated ram cles generally, and their striation is not so distinct. They divide and anastomos with each other, and they often contain fat cells. Their perimysium is but scantj Fibres of the Auricles - Are mostly transverse, superficial, & common to hot auricles; some however He deeper, and are proper to each aurioh SuPEEFicjAL, Transverse, or Common Fibres - Surround mainly the base of th sinuses, and are most marked anteriorly. Some dip into the intei auricular septuti Deep or Proper Fibres - May be divided into: Looped Fibres - Arch over each auricle from before backwards, and are a tached to the auriculo-ventricular rings both in front & behinc Annular Fibres - Encircle the appendi'ies auriculae, and the vense cavse, pu ; monary & coronary veins, extending for some distance upon the veins Fibres of the Ventricles - Vide aexb Tablet. j

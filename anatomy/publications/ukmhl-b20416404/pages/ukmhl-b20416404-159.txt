145 â€¢:he mediastinum Is the antero.posterior septum comprised between the two lungs & pleurae. It is divided into three parts by the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. Anterior Mediastinum - is the part in front of the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. It is narrow above, where it contains the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid, the upper part of the left internal mammary vessels, a large quantity of loose areolar tissue, & a few lymphatic glands. It is narrower still behind the middle piece of the sternum, where the two pleurae come in direct contact as low down as the 4th costal cartilage. Quite inferiorly, in consequence of the notch in the lower part of the anterior border of the left lung, it expands to the left behind the 4th & 5th intercostal spaces of the left side; here it contains the lower part of the left internal mammary vessels, & that part of the triangularis sterni muscle, which overlies the apex of the heart. Middle Mediastinum - Isthepart which contains the pericardium, heart & large vessels (ascending aorta, pulmonary vessels, superior vena cava; - the inferior vena cava enters pericardium through opening in cordiform tendon of diaphragm), and also the phrenic nerves. It is the widest part of the mediastinum. Posterior Mediastinum - Is the part behind the pericardium, heart, & large vessels. It contains the descending aorta, trachea, oesophagus; the venae azygos major & minor & the left superior intercostal; the pneumogastrio & splanchnic nerves; the thoracic duct; fat & lymphatic glaad.<j.

244 GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. The smallest of the three divisions of the 8fch pair. Arises from lateral tract of medulla oblongata abovepneujnogastric. — Its deep origin is from a grey nucleus on floor of 4th ventricle, jj Through anterior & inner part of jugular foramen in front of pneumogastric & spinal accessory and in a separate sheath, grooving lower border of petrous portion of temporal hone and presenting two ganglia! Sup. or Jugular G. or G. of the Root — Small, and involves only the outer fibresj Inf. of Petrous G. or G. of Andersch — Larger, and involves whole of fibres. Gives oflffrom petrous ganglion: Tympanic branch or JacobsofUs nerve^ described below; Anastomotic br. to ganglion of the root dr^ to auricular br, of the pneumogastiic J and from a little below the ganglion: Anastomotic br. to facial nerve. — This branch pierces post, belly of digastrio, Downwards & forwards in front of pneumogastric & between int. carotid & int. jugular rein. Beneath styloid process & muscles connected with it to lower border of stylo-pharyngeus, Curves inwards upon stylo-pharyngeus & middle constrictor. Beneath hyo-glossus to mucous membrane of fauces & base of tongne. BRANCHES: Tympanic Br. or JaCObSOn's N. — Arises from petrous ganglion. Ascends through small canal in petrous bone to tympanum, where divides into i|l i Bks. op Communication — To carotid plexus and great ^ small petromll \ branches of fackL ^ \ Brs. or Distribution — To fenestra rotunday fenestra ovalis 6^ mucous brane of Eustachian tube.' Carotid Brs, —Descend on internal carotid artery, and join pharyngeal bra. of , pneumogastric, sup. laryngeal & sympathetic. || Pharyngeal Brs. — Three or four,* form pharyngeal plexus by joining opposite |j middle constrictor with pharyngeal brs. of pneumogastric, sup. laryngeal & i sympathetic. Muscular Brs. — To stylo-pharyngeus ^ constrictors of pharynx. )i ij Tonsillar Brs. — To tonsil, forming tonsillar plexus, branches of which are distri- buted to soft palate & fauces. Lingual Brs. — To mucous membrane of base & side of tongue.

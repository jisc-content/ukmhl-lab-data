307 TEUOTURE of the LARGE INTESTINE. Four coats t SEROUS — Thrown, especially on transverse colon, into numerous small pouches filled with fat, the appendices epiploicte* MUSCULAR — Consists of fibres External Longitudinal - Are most of them grouped, orer (cascum & colon, into three longitudinal bands about half an inch wide, though a few spread out in a thin continuous layer over remainder of circumference of gut; - to these bands, as they are shorter than the intervening parts of the tube, is due the eacculation of the large intestine. These bands are situated as follows s Posterior - Along attached border of intestine j Anterior = In front j on transverse colon it lies along attached margin of great omentum. Lateral ~ On inner surface of ascending & descending colon, on under sur- face of transverse. Internal Circular - Are accumulated in large numbers between the sacouli, CELLULAR — A nidus for the division of the vessels before they enter the mucous coat. MUCOUS — Pale, destitute of villi & valvulse conniventes, thrown into crescentic folds in intervals between the sacculi. Presents a few solitary lenticular glands or closed folli- cles ; its tubular glands are larger & more numerous than those of small intestine; its epithelium is columnar. VESSELS & NERVES — Arteries, from superior & inferior mesenteric; are distri- buted in same way as over small intestine. - Veins open into corresponding veins, which form part of portal system. - Lymphatics form a plexus in the mucous & submucous layers j those of caecum & of ascending & transverse colon enter into mesenteric glands, those of descending colon & rectum, into lumbar glands. - Nebves from superior & inferior mesenteric plexuses j form same gangliated plexuses as in small gut

288 STRUCTURE of the TEETH-4th Tablet. ENAMEL. Thickest on cutting edge or grinding surface 5 becomes gradually thinner near neck. Consists of dense hard hexagonal fibres disposed perpendicularly to the surface of the cro\( and of about -g^^Q of an inch in diameter. Their inner ends are implanted into mimi hexagonal depressions in the dentine. Their outer ends, somewhat larger, & free, g:, a tesselated appearance to the surface of the tooth. They are striated transversely. Their course is somewhat wavy, especially near the dentine, where they are grouji in strata or ranges, which cross each other in direction, so as to give rise to the appe i ance, on a longitudinal section, of lines, alternately dark & pale, radiating from theinii to the outer surface of the enamel. Numerous fine dark concentric lines termed the coloured UneSi are also seen crossi the enamel fibres; they are of a brownish colour, but whether they are due to a depc! of pigment or not is not known. Small fissures are usually seen in the deeper parts of the enamel between the strf ! or ranges of fibres as they pass down to the dentine; these fissures communicate w:i the dentinal tubules. ; Enamel contains but 3-5 per cent, of animal matter, the remainder, or 96-5 per oefj consisting of phosphate of lime with a little carbonate of lime, phosphate of magnes! fluoride of calcium, & other salts. When submitted to the prolonged action of dili, acids, the enamel is therefore almost entirely dissolved. A delicate membrane, the cuticle of the enamel or NasmytKs membrane^ is said to co^jj the enamel of unworn teeth, the surface of which teeeh is always crossed by more or 1(' marked concentric ridges easily distinguishable with a common lens. This membra 11 is of an epithelial or horny nature; it therefore withstands the action of acids

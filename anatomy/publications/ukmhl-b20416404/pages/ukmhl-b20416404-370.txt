342 COVERINGS of the TESTICLE Are the: - Scrotum - Consists of two layers f Integument - Thin & brownish j presents a few sebaceous follicles & thinly scatter® crisp hairs, and is divided into two lateral halves by a median raph6, whic raph6 is continued forwards on under surface of penis and backwards alon middle line of perinasum to anus. Is closely applied to the testes and is com. gated transversely when the dartos is contracted, that is to say, usually in young & robust, and in all under the influence of cold, and is elongated flaccid when the dartos is relaxed, that is to say, usually in the debilitated aged, and in all under the influence of warmt: Daetos - Is a thick stratum of loose reddish tissue, a modification of the superficii fascia of the surrounding regions, consisting of areolar tissue with numeroi i superadded muscular fibres and without any fat; it sends inwards betwee j the two testicles a septum, the septum scroti^ which divides its cavity into two. It is contractile, but its contractility is slow in its action, and especially excite I by cold, not by electricit | Intercolumnar or External Spermatic Fascia - Thin cellular layer derived fro the margins of the external abdominal ring during the descent of the testis, ar continuous above with the intercolumnar fibres, which bound that ring superior! Cremasteric Fascia - Consists of the scattered bundles of fibres of the cremaster & iuterni, oblique muscles united by a little areolar tissil Fascia Propria - Relatively thick layer, the continuation of the infundibuliform process d the fascia transversalis, which layer supports both the cremasteric fascia & til tunica vaginalis reflexj Tunica Vaginalis - is derived from the peritoneum, of which it is at first a continnatio j but from which it is subsequently cut oflTby the closure of that part of the peritonei pouch, which extends from the internal abdominal ring to a short distance from tl: | testicle. - Is divided ink j ViscEBAL Portion ok Tunica Vaginalis Pkopria - Surrounds the testicle, and corei j both the upper or outer surface of the epididymis and also the under surface • ^ its central part or body, penetrating, along its outer border, between it&tl ; testicle, and thus forming the digitalfosi Paeietal Portion, or Tunica Vaginalis Reflexa - Is reflected from the posterior bo | der of the testicle upon the inner surface of the fascia propria, extendin; however, a short distance up the cord upon its anterior & inner aspeotj

287 TEUOTURE of the TEETH-3rd Tablet,, DENTINE (Continued). Though the matrix be homogeneous in structure (Sharpey), its calcification in super- imposed strata and by means of globular or spheroidal deposits (Vide Development of the Teeth) gives rise to A Tendency to split into Lamellsa - This tendency becomes evident after decalcifi- cation by the prolonged action of weak acids, or after prolonged boiling with caustic potash: The softened dentine is then easily torn into cribriform lamellse parallel, or nearly so, to the surface of the pulp; a thin transverse section similarly treated breaks up into concentric rings like the year-rings of wood (Salter). - These lamellfe & rings mark the size & shape of the pulp-cavity during the successive stages of calcification. Incremental Lines, Interglobular Spaces - These are dark lines of imperfect calcification separating the above lamellae. They vary greatly in number & breadth, but are always more or less apparent in a fine longitudinal section of a fully formed tooth. Under a high power they are seen to consist of small cavities bounded by, and therefore receiving their shape from, the minute nodules or globules of dentinal deposit (Salter). Granular Layer of Purkinje - is a layer of small interglobular spaces which usually surrounds the fang just beneath the cement, and sometimes the crown just beneath the enamel. The more superficial of the incremental lines are con- tinued into this layer.

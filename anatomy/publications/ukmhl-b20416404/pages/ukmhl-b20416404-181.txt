167 BRANCHES of the AXILLABY ARTEEY Vary considerably in mode o£ origin, size & number. Ai-e still usually described after Haller as being given ofi" as follows, from FIRST PART: Sup. Thoracic — Small, inwards along upper border of pectoralis minor, and then between latter muscle & pectoralis major j anastomoses with iutercostales &, internal mammary. Acromio-tlioracic — Short, thick, from fore part of artery. Forwards to upper border of pectoralis minor, and divides int-o branches: AcKOiiiAL - Join with suprascapular & with both circumflex. Thokacic - Two or three. To pectorales & serratus maguus, and join with iutercostales & internal mammary. Humeral - One, rather large. Downwards with cephalic vein between pec- toralis major & deltoid. SECOND PART: Long Thoracic or Ext. Mammary — Large branch. Along lower border of pectoralis minor to mamma, pectorales &, serratus, and to axillary glands & subscapularis. Joins with the other thoracic & with subscapular. Alar Thoracic — Small & often wanting. To axillary glands & cellular tissue. THIRD PART: Subscapular — The largest" branch. Along [lower border of subscapularis to lower angle of scapula, where joins with posterior scapular. Gives off twigs to surrounding muscles, and DoRSALis ScAPUL.E - Arises an inch & a half from origin of subscapular. Eound outer border of scapula between teres major, teres minor & long head of triceps, and then between teres minor & the bone. Gives off: Branches to subscapular fossa between subscapularis & bone; join with posterior- & suprascapular. Descending br. between teres major & minor. Branches to infraspinous fossa ; join with posterior- & suprascapular. Ant. Circumflex — The smaller. Outwards beneath coraco-brachialis, short head of biceps & deltoid, giving off twig to shoulder joint; joins with following & with acromial branch of acromio-thoracic. Post. Circumflex — The larger. Through quadrangular space between teres major, teres minor, long head of triceps & humerus, and round neck of humerus beneath deltoid. Gives twigs to shoulder joint, and joins with preceding & with acromial branch of acromio-thoracic.

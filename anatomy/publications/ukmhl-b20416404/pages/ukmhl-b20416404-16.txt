4 THE THREE GROUPS of VERTEBRAE. CERVICAL VERTEBRiE — The smallest. Present: - BODY — Small, broad from side to side. Presents: - Upper Surface - Concave from side to side, and rounded off anteriorly. Under Surface - Convex from side to side, and prolonged downwards anteriorly. T5T7TMn?^f.^'®^ Surface - Situated therefore on a lower level than the posterior. Fi^Dli^LiLts —Arise from lower part of body, and of the two — The superior ones are the deepest, and somewhat the narrowest. LAMINA — Long and narrow. FORAMEN — Large and triangular. SPINOUS PROCESS — Projects horizontally backwards, and is short, bifid, & grooved TRANSVERSE PROCESSES - Short, bifid, grooved superiorly, perforated iT'thlS base tor passage of vertebral artery & vein, and situated on the outer side of the mi, „ pedicles^in front of the articular processes* ine existence of the foramen at the base of the cervical transverse pro- cesses, and the situation of these processes on the outer side of the pedicles are owing to tlieir being formed of two roots, which roots correspond, the posterior one to the transverse processes properly so-called, the anterior ARTICULAR PROCESSES _ Form a small vertical column. The superio^ ones look upwards & backwards, the inferior ones look downwards & forwards. DORSAL VERTEBR.ffiS — Intermediate in size. Present; - BODY — Heart-shaped, thicker behind than in front, and has two demi-facets on each side, which demi-facets articulate with the heads of the ribs. ^ A^7^rpJ!^Jl f^om upper part of body, and of the two | T A JrVSlir — The inferior ones are the deepest and broadest. i LAMIJ^^ — Short & broad. ^ FORAMEN — Small & round. ?RiTsVERS^E^PROr^^S^^^^^ triangular oblique, and ends in a single tubercle. | iJiAi^cvii.RbE PROCESSES — Long, thick, obliquely directed outwards & backwards, ana situated behind the articular processes the pedicles. Their extremity is! enlarged, and presents m front an articular facet for tubercle of correspond.) From the back of the extremity of the few lower dorsal transverse proces-'^ ses arise three tubercles, termed external, inferior, & superior, which tubercles correspond respectively to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebree, and to the accessory & mammillary tubercles found, the former on the back ot the transverse processes, the latter on the back of the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae. ARTICULAR PROCESSES - Nearly vertical. The superior ones look backwards & outwards, the inferior ones look forwards & inwards. LUMBAR VERTEBRA — The largest. Present- ^SSJn™^^^®' broadest from side to side, rather thicker in front than behind, r J^jDibLEb — Thick; arise fvom upper part of body, and of the two NOTCHES — The inferior ones are the deepest & broadest. LAMINA — Short, broad & thick. ~ quadrilateral, and ends in a rough vertical border TRANSVERSE PROCESSES - Long, slender, directed transversely outWs and situated m front of the articular processes, but behind the pedicles, and in a line with the external tubercles of the lower dorsal transverse processes, to which ^ , , , „ , J correspond. _ Un the back of each, near its base, is a small tubercle the accessory tubercle^ which points downwards & inwards, and which corresponds to the inferior ^■^r^,^ , tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse nrocpsaoq ' ARTICULAR PROCESSES - Thick, strong & vertical. The superior ones are Concave look backwards & lawards, and are farther apart than the inferior ones, which they embrace. The inferior ones are convex, look forwards & outwards, and are nearer to each other than are the superior ones. On the back of each superior articular process is a small tubercle, the mammillary tubercle^ which corresponds to the superior tubercles on the lower dorsal transverse processes.

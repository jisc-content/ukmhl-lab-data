Its arraogment is as follows: - (Vide Quain's diagram). 1st Lumbar Nerve - Gives off: Jlio-hypogastric, Ilio-inguinal, Small part of Genito-crural, Conwmnicatmg branch to 2nd Lumbar* 2nd Lumbar Nerve - Completes Genito-crural, - and gives off Greater part of External Ctctaneoiis, and Conimunicating branch to 3rd Lumbar, from which communicating branch the Anterior Crural, Obturator, Accessory Obturator nerves (when tha latter exists) are partly derivedj 3rd Lumbar Nerve - Completes External Cutaneous, and pives off Greater part of Anterior Crural, Obturator ^ Accessory Obturator Nerves (when the latter exists), and a Communicating branch to 4th Lumbar. 4th Lumbar Nerve - Completes Anterior Crural, Obticrator, &^ Accessory Obturator Nerves, (when the latter exists), and gives off a Large branch to^t^ Lumbar, Yihioh. large branch forms with the latter nervo the Lumbo-Sacral Nerve or Cord,

33 LATERAL REGION of the SKULL Presents from behind forwards the: Mastoid process ; Ext. auditory meatus ; Zygomatic arch & 7'a7nus of the jaw^ which two latter arch over the temporal, zygomatic & spheno-maxillary fossae. TEMPORAL FOSSA Is formed by the temporal, frontal, & malar bones, the great wing of the sphenoid, & the anterior inferior angle of the parietal, and is deeply excavated below & in front. Is bounded above by the temporal ridge, and opens widely below into the zygomatic fossa, the boundary line between the two being the zygomatic arch & the pterygoid ridge. ZYGOMATIC FOSSA Is an irregular and imperfectly enclosed space, the incomplete walls of which are formed on the anterior, inner, upper & outer aspects respectively by thf Ttibcrosity of the sup. maxillary bone^ Ext. pterygoid plate, Under surface of great wing oj sphenoid as far as pterygoid ridge, and squamous portion of temporal bone. Zygomatic arch & ramus of lower jaw. Communicates with temporal fossa beneath the zygoma, and with the orbit & spheno- maxillary fossae through the spheno-maxillary & pterygo-maxillary fissures. Spheno-Maxillary Fissure - is bounded by superior maxiUary, great wing of sphenoid, malar & palate bones, aud joins internally at right angles with pterygo- maxillary fissure. Opens up communications between the orbit and the temporal, zygomatic & spheno-maxillary fossae. Transmits infraorbital artery, superior maxillary nerve & ascending or orbital branches of Meckel's ganglion. PterygO-Maxillary Fissure - is comprised between pterygoid process & tuberosity of superior maxillary bone. Joins superiorly at right angles with spheno-maxillary fissure. Transmits internal maxillary artery from zygomatic to spheno-maxillary fossa. SPHENO-MAXILLARY FOSSA — is the narrow & vertically elongated space comprised between the pterygoid process & the maxillary tuberosity, and bounded above & internally by the body of the sphenoid & the vertical plate of the palate bone. Its upper part is the point of meeting of the sphenoidal, spheno-maxillary & pterygo- J"* ■ maxillary fissures. It communicates with the cranium, orbit, zygomatic & nasal fossae by the foramen rotun- dum & spheno- & pterygo-maxillary fissures & the spheno-palatine foramen, and has, opening into it, the vidian, pterygo-palatine, posterior palatine & accessory posterior palatine canals.

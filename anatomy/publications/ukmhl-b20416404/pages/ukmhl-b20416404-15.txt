3 THE VERTEBBiE Present for examination t - JBody - Forms a short column, which presents: Ant. Surface - Convex from side to side, concave from above downwards; presents numerous small vascular foramina. Post. Surface - Concave from side to side, flat from above downwards; presents one or more irregular apertures for exit of venae basis vertebrse- Upper & Under Surfaces - Eough & slightly concave, and surrounded by a pro- minent rim. Pedicles - Join tlie body to the laminee. They are constricted, and their constriction gives rise to the Notches - Which latter, by the superposition of the vertebrae, form the intervertebral fora* viina. Laminae - Broad & flat, rough above below for the ligamenta subflava; bound posteriorly the Poramen - Which, by the superposition of the vertebrae, forms the spinal canal. Spinous process - Projects backwards from the point of junction of the laminas. Transverse processes - Two. Project outwards from th"^ sides of the arch. Articular processes - Pour. Projec t upwards & downwards from the point of junction o£ the pedicles with the laminae. The superior ones look backwards, the inferior ones look forwards. N. — But little, which would be applicable to each of the three groups of vertebrae, can, it is believed, be added to this description.

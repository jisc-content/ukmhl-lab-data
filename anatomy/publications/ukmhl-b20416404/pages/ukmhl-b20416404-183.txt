169 RADIAL ARTERY The smaller branch of bifurcation of brachial half an inch below bend of elbow or opporti© neck of radius* Down front of outer side of forearm to a little to inner side of styloid process of radius. Round outer side of carpus beneath extensor tendons of thumb. Through upper part of first interosseous space between the two heads of abductor indicis. Over bases of metacarpal bones & interossei, and beneath flexor tendons, lumbricales & nerves to base of 5th metacarpal bone, where inosculates with communicating branch of ulnar, forming deep palmar arch. Lies a finger's breadth above level of superficial palmat arch. RELATIONS in FOREARM: In Front - Skin, superficial fascia, deep fascia, supinator longua. Behind - Tendon of biceps, supinator brevis, pronator radii teres, flexor sublimifi digitorum, flexor longus pollicis, pronator quadratus, lower end of radiu3. On Outer Side - Supinator longus, radial nerve in middle third. On Inner Side - Pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis. BRANCHES: IN FOREAEM: Radial recurrent — From upper part. Between brachialis anticus & supinator Ion. gus, and anastomoses with interosseous recurrent & superior profunda. Muscular — Numerous, to muscles on either side. Ant. carpal — From lower part. Joins with anterior carpal branch of ulnar beneath deep flexor tendons; gives twigs to articulations of carpus. Superficialis V0I39 — From termination of artery in forearm. Small, and ends in m&scles of thumb; or of more considerable size, and joins with & com- pletes superficial palmar arch, ON BACK OP WRIST : Post, carpal — Over back of carpus beneath extensor tendons. Joins with posterior carpal branch of ulnar to form posterior carpal arch, which anastomoses with termination of anterior interosseous artery of forearm, and gives ofl'; Dorsal Interosseous Arteries of Third & Fourth Spaces - Anastomose at upper part of interosseous spaces with perforating branches of deep palmar arch. - Are usually exhausted in sheaths of tendons, interossei & integument over back of first phalanges, but are sometimes larger than usual, and are then prolonged upon dorsum of fingers in the shape of dorsal digital branches similar to those of thumb & outer side oi index, and of toes. Metacarpal, or Dorsal Interosseous Art. of Second Space — Arises be. neath extensor tendons of thumb, sometimes in common with posterior car- pal, and is similar to, but larger than, the foregoing interosseous arteries. Correspond together to a first dorsal interosseous artery. Dorsales pollicis / The former supplies dorsal digital branches to both sides of back licis f licis j T . ,. .

Perforating — Three. Through upper part of three inner interosseous spaces, and anastomose with corresponding dorsal interosseous arteries. Deep palmar interosseous — Usually three or four, but very variable in size & number. Descend in front of interosseous spaces, join with superficial pal- mar interosseous branches from superficial palmar arch, and then bifurcate to form palmar digital branches to 3^ fingers on inner side of hand.

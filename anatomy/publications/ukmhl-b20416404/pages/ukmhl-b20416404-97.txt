83 ICKOMIO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION Is an arthrodial articulation. ABTICUL AR SURFACES — small, flat, elongated from before backwards, and oblique downwards & inwards. LIGAMENTS: Sup. Acromio-ClaviCUlar - strong broad band, from Upper part of outer end of clavicle to Adjoining part of upper surface of acromion. Inf. Acromio-Clavicular - Similar to, but thinner than, preceding, from Under part of outer end of clavicle to Adjoining part of under surface of acro7nio7i. CoraCO-Clavicular - Does not properly form part of tbe articulation but is usually described with it, as it powerfully assists in retaining the clavicle in its normal position. Consists of two fasciculi, the Tkapezoid Ligament - The most anterior & external, quadrilateral, from Upper surface of coracoidprocess to Oblique line on under surface of clavicle - Is joined to the following by its posterior border; Conoid Ligament - Posterior & internal to foregoing, and conical with base upwards, from Base of coracoid process to Conoid tubercle on under surface of clavicle. INTERARTICULAR FIBRO-CARTILAGE — Wedge-shaped with base turned up. wards and attached to superior acromio-olavicular ligament. Is fre- quently absent, and rarely divides the articulation into two cavities, so that there is generally but one synovial membrane. PROPER LIGAMENTS of the SCAPULA Are two in number. Anterior^ or Coraco-Acromial - Broad, thick, triangular; from Apex of acromion to Whole length of outer border of coracoid process. - It completes the vault formed by the coracoid & acromion processes above the head of the humerus, and prevents dislocation of the humerus upwards. - A bursa is interposed between it and the humerus. Posterior, Transverse, or Suprascapular - Narrow band from Base of coracoid process to Inner margin of suprascapular notchj which it converts into a foramen for supra- scapular nerve.

218 STRUCTURE of the MESOOEPHALON Presents for examination transverse, longitudinal & antero-posterlor fibres, and gi matt TRANSVERSE FIBRES — Connect from side to side the laminae of the lateral p tions of the cerebellum, forming two set • Superficial Set - Constitute the pons Varolii properly so-called, and are separai by the superficial set of longitudinal fibres from t Deep Set - Which-lie between, and are more or less intermingled with, the supe cial & middle sets of longitudinal fibres, and are also largely intermingled w grey matt LONGITUDINAL FIBRES - Form three sets Inferior or Superficial Set - Lie between the superficial & deep sets of the tra verse fibres being, however, posteriorly, more or less intermixed with the latl They are derived from the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata; tl form superiorly the inferior or fasciculated porcion of the crus cere Lliddle Set - Lie behind the deep set of transverse fibres with which however they ' more or less intermingled anteriorly. They are derived from the fascici » gracilis, from the middle set of fibres of the lateral tract of the medulla & fr . the antero-internal division of the olivary fasciculus or fillet (the fibres fi the two former sources being joined together under the name of fascict i teres. They ascend beneath the gray matter of the floor of the 4th ventri , and go to form the upper portion or tegmentum of the crus cere . Deep or Supeierior Set - Are derived on the one hand from the laminae of 3 inferior verrailorra process & from the interior of the corpus dentatum of 3 cerebellum, and on the other hand from the postero-external division of 3 olivary fasciculus or fillet, the former set of fibres forming the superior pedui 3 of the cerebellum. They join the upper part or tegmentum of the crus cere . ANTERO-POSTERIOR FIBRES — Are derived partly from the floor of the i ventricle, and partly from some of the transversa fibres, whicb bend backwards f >> shrrb distance before they cross to the opposite 6 . GREY MATTER — Is largely intermixed with the deep transverse & middle longitud I fibres, and forms the locus niger of the crus cerebri & the greater part of the tnl • cula quadrigemina & pineal gla >

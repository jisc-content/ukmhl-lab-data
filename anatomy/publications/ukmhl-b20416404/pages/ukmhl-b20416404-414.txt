The subject is still in embryi. and should be gone into very thoroughly, or it will not be understood. In the Author's opinioi * the best advice to be given to those who wish to master it, is first to study carefully the admii i' able rt'siime given in the Eighth Edition of "Quain's Anatomy," and then to supplement this stud by that of Waldeyer's Article on the Auditory Nerve & Cochlea in Strieker's Handbook of Hii tology, the translation of which by Mr. Henry Power (for the New Sydenham Society), will t â€¢ found in every public library.

' % It would appear that the membrane of Corti, or membrana tectoria, ends in a thin fre edge above the outer set of hair-cells, or cells of Corti; the so-called scala inedia is therefore li part of the canalis cochlece. Hence the spiral canal is divided into three parts only, the scala vestibuli above, the scali tympani below, & the canalis cochlese in the middle. The scalse vestibuli and tympani ari continuous with the cavity of the osseous labyrinth, and are filled with perilymph. The canali jj cochlesc is joined to the saccule by the canalis reunions of Henle, and is filled with endolymph For a General View of the subject, see page 370. I

250 NOTES on the DEEP ORIGINS. The 2nd Nerve appears to derive deep origins, not from both Tabercula Quadrigemina, but fr the anterior one only. >. The points of origin of the %rd ^th Nerves on the floor oE the Aqueduct of Sylvius are so closely connected, that a nnckzcs co'iiimon to both nerves is sometimes described. - h. similar remark may be made respecting the origins of the Qth 6^ facial Nerves on the upper part of the floor of the Fourth Ventricle. A few of the fibres of the 2,rd nerve are said to run downwards with the longitudinal fibres (A the mesocephalon. â–  The 4//z Nerve^ in addition to the fibres arising from the two nuclei described in the text (the Olid on floor of Aqueduct of Sylvius & the one on upper part of floor of Fourth Ventricle), has some fibres which decussate with their fellows in the middle line of the valve of Vieussens. The two roots ofthe ^th Nerve appear to arise mainly from two tiuclei near the outer angle of the floor oftlu 4:ih ventricle. If traced from the nerve, the sensory fibres are seen to turn outwards, and to end ina nucleua which is continuous below with the Grey Tubercle of Rolando; while the motor fibres are seen to turn inwards, and to end in a group of large cells on the inner side of the foregoing nucleus. - A few of thel sensory fibres appear, however, to run, some of them inwards towards the middle line, some down* wards towards the lower part of the meddulla (Lockhart Clarke). v. Some of the fibres of the Facial Nerve decussate with their fellows in the middle line of the floof of the Fourth Ventricle.

222 INTERNAL STRUCTURE of the HEMISPHERES. ■ I PARTS SEEN BEFORE OPENING THE VENTRICLES: ! Centrum Ovale Minus - With the puncta vasculosa & the convoluted margin ol the divided grey matter ! Ventricle of the Corpus CalloSUm - Comprised between the corpus callosum I the gyrus fornicatus Centrum Ovale IVEajus - I^ito which the fibres of the corpus callosum are continueci! on either side j Corpus Callosum - Thick stratum of transverse & radiating white fibres which cod] nect the two hemispheres; arched from before backwards, thickest V broadest behind, thinnest towards centre. It presents Upper Sueface - Convex from before backwards, striated transversely, marked by a median depressed raphe which is bounded by two slightly elevate( bauds termed the nei-ves of Lancisi. More externally, beneath the gyru fornicatus, are other similar bands, the strice longitudinales lateralesx Under Surface - Blended behind with the fornix. In front, where it forms tb roof of the lateral ventricles, it is connected with the fornix by the septun lucidun Anterior Extremity or Genu - Curves downwards & backwards, presenting a narrowing reflected portion, the beaJz or rostrum. This latter is connected i with the lamina cinerea, and gives off two small white bands or pedimdesl which cross the anterior perforated space to the entrance of the fissure o i Sylvius^ Posterior Extremity or Splenium - Thick «fe rounded. Forms upper boundarj of middle portion of transverse fissure, and is joined in front with the fornia

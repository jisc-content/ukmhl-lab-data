ADVICE TO STUDENTS. The principal rules of the art of learning are to classify, to condense, and to proportion, according to their relative importance, the attention to be given to the facts that are to be retained. Classify.—Group things that are alike; thus, in learning one, several will be acquired. Condense,—The more concise the wording is, the more facts can be gone over in a given time, and the better they can be remembered. A firm grasp of the facts is what is wanted first; erudition may be courted afterwards. Propoi tion according to their relative impot'tance the attention to be given to the facts that are to be retained. The headings & subheads should be mastered first; then, in succession, the divisions, the sub-divisions, the principal points, the minor points, the noteworthy details, the minutiae. The Tablets are intended to assist the Student in carrying out these rules: The grouping and the condensing are done for him to a considerable extent. The arrangement adopted will further induce him, it is hoped, to proportion his attention rightly: - The Tablets, especially those on Anatomy, show at a glance the general outline of the subject they treat of j this outline should be studied first, and thoroughly understood and mastered before the Student goes any farther. This is of primary iinportance for the successful use of the TabletSy which, the Author would remind the Student, are intended simply to assist him in read- i]ig the standard Authors with greater profit and case, not to take the place of any other work.

119 )EEP MUSCLES of the BACK-Classification. May be divided into j LONG EXTENSOR MUSCLES of the BACK - Lie beneath the trapezius, the latissimns dorsi & the superficial layer of the lumbar fascia, and beneath the splenius & a special layer of fascia in the neck, & the serrati muscles & the vertebral aponeurosis in the back. They form a large elongated muscular and tendinous mass, narrow & principally tendinous and comprised in the sacral groove, below; enlarged & fleshy in the lumbar region,, where it is only partly contained in the vertebral groove, and is tightly sheathed be-- tween the spines, laminaa, & transverse processes of the vertebrae and the posterior &■ middle layers of the lumbar fascia; expanded and complexly subdivided into almost in- numerable muscular and tendinous fasciculi in the back; and, in the cervical region,, partly exhausted, but continued upwards towards the head by numerous superadded^ fibres, & also strengthened by an additional muscle, the complexus. The muscular & tendinous slips of which this mass is composed may be correctly and con- veniently arranged into three main groups forming respectively the ilio-costalis or sacro-lumbalis, the longissinms dorsi^ & the multifidus spines i the two former of which, joined together below, and increased by a few additional fibres, the spinalis dorsi, form the erector spines of the sacral & lumbar regions. (The term erector spines** would be much better applied to the whole of the long extensor muscles of the back than to any one part thereof). Each of these three groups has additional fasciculi superadded to it, by which fasciculi it is continued to the head or to near the head, and by which it is increased in bulk & strengths Thus to the- " ILIO-COSTALIS OR SACRO-LUMBALIS are superadded the I Muscidus accessorius ad ilio-costalem (or ad sacro-lumbalem) «& the cervicalis ascendensi I - to th©^ LONGISSIMUS DORSI are superadded the Transversalis colli the trachelo-mastoid; - to the MULTIFIDUS SPIN^ are superadded the Semispinales dorsi ^ colli & the rotatores spinez. To these groups are also added a few accessory fasciculi, the spinalis dorsi^ the spinalis collie & the biventer cervicis. SMALL MUSCLES of the SPINOUS & TRANSVERSE PROCESSES - Are the SupraspinaleSf interspinales, intertransversales, & extensor coccygis. SHORT POSTERIOR CRANIO-VERTEBRAL MUSCLES -Arotho Recti capitis postici major ^ minor^ & the Ohliqui superior ^ inferior.

232 SECOND or OPTIC NERVE Presents for exainination the optic tract, the optic commissure & the optic nerve proper. OPTIC TRACT Beg ins in the anterior & posterior quadrigejninal bodies by two distinct bundles of fibres, which pass between the corpora geniculata internum et externum^ become respectively connected with and receive fibres from the latter, unite, and receive additional fibres from the optic tJialavms. Ii Winds obliquely forwards across under surface of crus cerebri, being flattened in shape and slightly attached to the crus by its anterior margin. Leaves the crus as a round bundle and becomes connected v>\ih. the lamina cinerea & ike tuber cinereum, from both of which it is said to receive additional fibres. Joins its fellow to form optic commissure. OPTIC COMMISSURE or CHIASMA Is formed as follows: A few of the outer fibres of each optic tract pass into the optic nerve of the sa^ sid The mass of the fibres decussate, and pass into the optic nerve of the opposite side. A few of the innermost fibres, termed the inter-cerebral fibres, pass back to the cere- brum, forming the posterior fibres of the commissure and the innermost fibres of the optic tract of the opposite side. A few similar fibres, termed the inter-retinal fibres, pass along the anterior border of the commissure fi'om one optic nerve to the other. OPTIC NERVE Through optic foramen, being surrounded by a tubular process of the dura mater, which, as the nerve enters the orbit, subdivides, and both continues the sheath of the optio nerve, and forms the periosteum of the orbit. Pierces sclerotic and choroid about one tenth of an inch to the isner side of the axis of the eye, and expands into the retina. - The arteria centralis retinae pierces the optic nerve, and runs forwards in its substance to the retina.

VARIATIONS of the UTERUS ACCORDING to Age In infant the neck is larger than the body, and the organ lies above the brim of, , the pelvis. At puberty the uterus is pyriform in shape; it has descended into the | pelvis, and the arbor vitse is well marked. In old age, the uterus becomes pale, dense, ' & atrophied; the body & the cervix become less distinct; both the os internum & the - 05 externum diminish in size and sometimes close; the labia of the os externum almost entirely disappear, | ]y[eiistrusiti011 ■• -A-t each, period, especially when menstruation is first established, the uterus becomes enlarged, & more vascular; the os externum, more rounded, & its labia turgid & swollen; the mucous membrane of the cavity, thicker, softer & darker in colour. { | Pregnancy - During pregnancy the mucous membrane of the uter*us becomes thick, soft, 6 vascular, and is soon diflferentiated into decidua reflexa, decidua serotina, & de. j cidua vera. The muscular structure increases both by new formation and by the li hypertrophy of its pre-existing elements until about the sixth month, the weight of j the uterus increasing from about an ounce to from 1| to 3 lbs.; the subsequent en- largement of the uterus is due to distention. In shape the body becomes more | rounded and more directly continuous with the cervix, and towards the close of ges- 1 tation the cervix itself becomes distended, and its cavity becomes continuous with | that of the body. While thus increasing in bulk, the uterus makes its way betweea the layers of its broad ligaments, and, after first sinking somewhat within the cavity of the pelvis, it subsequently rises into the hypogastric region & into the lower part of the umbilical.; Parturition - Brings about the partial return to the virgin state. The weight of the j uterus usually remains, however, from two to three ounces; its cavity, larger; its OS externum, wider and more transverse with its margins puckered & fissured, i;

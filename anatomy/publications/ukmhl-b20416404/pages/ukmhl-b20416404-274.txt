256 CERVICAL PLEXUS. Formed by anterior branches of ibur upper cervical nerves & loops connecting them, and lies beneath sterno-mastoid, in front of levator anguli scapuIaD & scalenus medius & the four upper vertebrae. Communicates through loop between 4th & 5th nerves with brachial plexus, and, through its deep communicating branches, with pneumogastrio, spinal accessory, hypoglossal & superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. - Its superficial branches communicate with facial & great occipital. Its branches are superficial & deep. SUPERFICIAL BRANCHES — wind round posterior border of sterno-mastoid ono above the other in the following order, which is also the order in which they arise. Sm3<ll Occipital - From 2nd cervical; variable in size & sometimes double. i Ascends boh.nd sterno-mastoid to attollens aurem & posterior belly of occipito. I frontalis, and perforates deep fascia to integument of back of side of head & j upper part of back of pinna; its auricular branches being sometimes supplied ' by great occipital. Joins with great occipital, great auricular, & posterior i auricular branch of facial. - The second small occipital, or smallest occipital, ! when it exists, arises from 3rd nerve, and sends twigs to back of neck. , Great Auricular - From 2nd & 3rd cervical nerves. I Ascends upon sterno-mastoid & beneath platysma to near lobule of ear, where it | divides into branches: Auricular - Several, large; to integument of back of pinna, joining with pos. i terior auricular branches of facial & pneumogastrio. Some twigs supply, outer surface of lobule, and one reaches outer surface of pinna through a fissure between antihelix & concha, i Mastoid - To integument behind ear, joining with post, auricular branch of facial,il Facial - To integument of face, and to parotid gland joining with facial. Superficial Cervical - The largest; from 2nd & 3rd. Crosses sterno-mastoid beneath platysma & external jugular vein, and divides into brs.; Ascending - Gives off an ascending twig to external jugular vein, joins with cervico-facial branch of facial, and, supplying platysma, pierces it to integument of upper & front part of nect. i Descending - Pierces platysma to integument of lower & front part of neck, j Superficial Descending - Several large branches from 3rd & 4th. Descend between sterno-mastoid & trapezius, and divide into branches: Sternal - Cross origin of sterno-mastoid to integument of front of chest as far as middle line. Clavicular - Cross clavicle (sometimes one of them perforates the bone) to integument over pectoralis major & deltoid, communicating with cuta. neous branches of the superior intercostal nerveti. Acromial - Over acromion & clavicular origin of trapezius to integument of outer & back part of shoulder. DEEP BRANCHES — Divided into internal & external. INTERNAL - Are- Communicating - From loop between 1st & 2nd cervical to pneumogastrio, hypoglossal & superior cervical ganglion of sympathetic; and also from 3rd & 4th to cord of sympathetic below the ganglion.; Muscular - From 1st & 2nd, to recti capitis antici major & minor, and rectus lateralis, Communicans Noni - From 2nd & 3rd. Downwards & forwards across sheath of carotid vessels (sometimes within the sheath, and then either in front of or behind internal jugular vein), and, near middle of neck, forms a loop with descendens noni; from convexity of which loop branches are given off to the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid and omo-hyoid. Phrenic or Int. Respiratory of Sir C. Bell - From 3rd, 4th, and usually also from 5th. Downwards & inwards in front of scalenus anticus. Between subclavian vein & 1st part of subclavian artery crossing internal mammary,: and receiving a filament from sympathetic, sometimes another from 5th & 6th ^ i cervical nerves, and occasionally on the left side, one from the ansa hypoglossi. | ^ Crosses arch of Aorta & pulmonary artery, on the left side. ^sscends, on the right side, on outer side of right innominate vein & sup. vena cava. In front of root of lung & along side of pericardium to diaphragm, and divides in I T, t, *° branches which perforate the diaphragm and supplv it by its under surface. Both nerves give off twigs to the pericardium & pleura, and join with the phrenic plexus of the sympathetic, the right nerve sending also a few filaments to the EXTERNAL - Are: diaphragmatic gangta Communicating - Join spinal accessory in substance of sterno-mastoid, in occipitali triangle, & beneath trapezius.; Muscular - To sterno-mastoid (from 2nd nerve), levator anguli scapulse (from 3rd), scale. nus medius & trapezius (from 3rd & 4th) ! mm

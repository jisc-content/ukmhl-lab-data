310 PERITONEUM-2nd Tablet. The two Sacs traced together in Vertical Direction. From transverse fissure of liver: - To lesser curvature of stomach, forming lesser or gastro-hepatic omentum; Separate to surround stomach; Descend iu front of intestine, forming the two anterior layers of great omentum â€¢ Ascend to transverse colon, forming the two posterior layers of great omentum ; Separate to surround transverse colon; Backwards to spine, forming transverse meso-colon; rate: One descends and forms in succession the mesentery, meso-rectum, recto-ves ,1 pouch (or recto-vaginal & utero-vesical pouches),}. The other ascends in front of pancreas and passes over back part of under sur e of liver to foramen of Wins k (In the foetus, also occasionally in the child, and even, though very ra; |r, in the adult, the two posterior layers of the great omentum ascend in froi j)f the transverse colon without adhering to it, or adhering to it but slightly, id then pass backwards together to the spine above the transverse meso-colon. '. !'e they separate: - One layer descends, and forms in succession the tram Isi meso-colon, the mesentery, meso-reotum, &c.; the other layer ascends, as a e stated, over the pancreas & liver. The pouch between the transverse n > colon & the great omentum subsequently disappears by degrees, adhei is amounting finally to complete fusion of the two layers into one, being ei p- lished between the two walls of the pouch before adult age is reached.

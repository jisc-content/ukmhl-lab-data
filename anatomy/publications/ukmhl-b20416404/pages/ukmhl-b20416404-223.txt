209 STRUCTURE of the SPINAL C0RD-2nd Tablet. WHITE FIBRES Are the fibres of the roots of the nerves and the proper fibres of the white columns, which latter are to a great extent the continuation of the former after they have entered into and again emerged from the grey matter. FIBRES OP THE ROOTS OP THE NERVES. Fibres of Anterior Roots - Cross antero-lateral columns horizontally & in distinct bundles to anterior cornu of grey matter, and divide into three sets Ikner Set - Through large cells of inner group, and then through anterior or white commissure to anterior & lateral columns of opposite side. Middle Set - Radiate through the grey substance, and become ascending, descending & antero-posterior, the antero-posterior fibres either ending in the cells of the lateral intermediate tract or joining the fibres of the posterior roots of the nerves. Outer Sei -Through large cells of outer group into anterior & lateral columns of same side. Fibres of Posterior Roots - Biverge in the substantia gelatinosa, and then divide into three sets. Oblique Set - Run upwards &dcwnwards for a variable distance with proper fibres of posterior columns before they enter the grey matter. Some of the ascending fibres pass up directly to the ganglia of the base of the brain without entering into any connection whatever with the vesicular substance. Inner Set - Through posterior or grey commissure to lateral & posterior columns of opposite side. Outer Set - Through grey substance to anterior & lateral columns of same side, some becoming continuous with fibres of anterior roots. - Many of the fibres of the two latter sets are more or less oblique upwards or downwards. PROPER FIBRES OF THE COLUMNS â€” Pass upwards & downwards for a variable distance connecting the cells of the different segments of the grey matter. Some are believed to pass up uninterruptedly to the ganglia of the base of the brain.

THE THORAX in GENERAL. Conical with convex walls and axis oblique downwards & forwards; broadest below & from side to side J bounded by dorsal portion of spine, ribs, costal cartilages & sternum. Presents for examination: - OUTER SURFACE — Convex. Presents: - Anterior Aspect - Oblique downwards & forwards, 8| inches in height. Presents i sternum, costal cartilages, & front part of ribs, which latter present their anteriori|| angles disposed in a line oblique downwards & outwardaj Posterior Aspect-Twelve inches in height, depressed centrally, convex on either side.i Presents : - f In Middle Line - Spines, vertebral grooves, transverse processes, costo-transverse articulations; - Laterally - Prominent convexity of posterior part of ribs, which convexity in- j creases in breadth from above downwards, and is bounded externally by the posterior angles of the ribs disposed in a line oblique downwards & outwards , XiSlterStl Aspect - oblique, rounded, thirteen inches in height, most convex posteriorly,;. In length the ribs & the costal cartilages increase from the 1st to the 7th,i and decrease from the 8th to the 12th; the intercostal spaces increase froiri the 1st to tbe 5th only, and then decrease from the 6th to the 11th. The width of the ribs & intercostal spaces decreases from the Ist to the last, the width oil the latter being greatest in front. The degree of obliquity of the ribs increasesi from the 1st to the 9th, and decreases from the 9th to the 12th; it is mosij marked behind i SUPERIOR APERTURE or APEX — Narrow, heart-shaped, oblique downwards & fori wards, bounded by the sternum, first dorsal vertebra, first rib & first costal cartilagej INFERIOR APERTURE or BASE — Expanded from side to side, widest toward middle, and, from before backwards, diminished behind by prominence of body of las dorsal vertebra, and greatly increased in front by being prolonged upwards & fori wards between the asternal ribs & their cartilages as far as the ensiform appendisi INTERNAL CAVITY — Broadest from side to side, narrowed from before backwards iif middle line, and partly divided posteriorly into two, by the incomplete septum formei' by bodies of vertebrae, on either side of which bodies it is prolonged backwards so as t form two deep grooves widest belov

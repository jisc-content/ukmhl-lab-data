SEPABATE DESCRIPTION of the EIGHT LAYERS, Layer of Herve-Fibreg. Is the direct continuation of tlie optic nerve. At its point of entrance into tlie eye, the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic & choroid, and all the layers of the retina, except this layer of nerve-fibres, which it forms by its expansion. Its fibres then radiate from the colliculus to .the ora serrata, forming delicate inter-communicating bundles supported by a few flattened connective tissue corpuscles. These fibres consist of axis-cylinders only, without either primitive or medullary sheaths; they vary a good deal in size, and are wanting at the yellow spot. Ganglionic Layer, or Layer of Nerve-Cells, Consists, over the greater part of its extent, of a single stratum of nerve-cells, bipolar or multipolar. Over the yellow spot (the fovea excepted), & in its neighbourhood, the cells are more thickly set (sometimes they are eight or ten deep), but they are smaller. Towards the ora serrata, they form but an incomplete layer. These cells present one delicate unbranched internal process, and one or more external processes, a good deal thicker, and branched. The internal process arises from the inner ex- tremity of the cell, which is always more or less rounded, and it passes obliquely into the layer of the nerve-fibres, with one of the fibres of which it probably becomes continuous. The origin of the external branched process, or processes, is from the outer and usually tapering end of the cell; these processes pass up into the inner molecular layer.

9 370^ APPENDIX TO THE ORGANS OF THE SENSES. The Olfactory Cells of Schultze, Two kinds of epithelial striactures are found in tlie olfactory region, columnar cells & gpindle-sliaped cells. The latter consist of a large clear nucleus surrounded by only a small amount of granular protoplasm, and they are by far the more numerous. The deep ends of the columnar cells taper to a point, and are prolonged into processes, which branch, anastomose with each other, and form a plexus in the deeper strata of the epithelium. The spindle-shaped cells are grouped round the tapering ends of the columnar cells, an^ amongst their anastomosing processes. They give ofE two processes, a superficial one & a dee^ one. The superficial processes are cylindrical or very slightly tapering ; they pass up to the free surface between the columnar cells, and are now stated to terminate abruptly, in man & mammals, at the same level as these.* The deep processes are less regular, more delicate, & varicose. Statements diflEer with respect to the connexions with nerves of the deep processes of the structures just described. According to Exner, the deep processes of both structures join in one & the same plexus, the fibres of which are continuous with nerve-fibrils. According to Schultze, it is the deep processes of the spindle-shaped cells only that are continued into nerve-fibres. Mr. Newell Martin npholds the views of Schultze. "* In birds, amphibia & reptiles, the superficial processes of the spiudle-shaped cells are prolonged into fine bristles.

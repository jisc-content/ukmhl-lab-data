358 THE FASCIAE. THE FASCI-aE OF THE BACK. The Vertebral Fascia. The vertebral fascia is an extension downward of the back part of the outer layer of the cervical fascia. It stretches from the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae to tlie angles of the ribs, covering in the deep vertical muscles of the Fig. 417.—Synovial membranes of tendons in tlie dorsum of tlie forearm and hand, artificially distended. (Testut.) back, passing in front of the serratus posterior su2:»erior, and becoming continuous below with the lumbar fascia. The Lumhar Fascia. The lumhar fascia (Fig. 418) is, in reality, rather a combination of tendons than a true fascia of investment, although it serves also in the latter capacity. The latissimus, serratus posterior inferior, obliquus internus abdominis, and trans- versalis abdominis all participate in its formation. Regarded as a fascia, it springs from the vertebral column in three layers, the outer or po.sterior, the middle, and the inner or anterior. The outer layer begins at the tips of the spinous processes of the lumbar and sacral vertebrte, forming a direct downward continuation of the vertebral fascia. It is attached above to the last rib, and below to the hind third of the outer lip of the iliac crest and the ilio-lumbar ligament. The middle laijer stai'ts from the free ends of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae; and the inner letyer arises from the front of tlie bases of the same processes. The outer and middle unite at the outer edge of the erector spina?, which occupies the space between them ; and this double layer is joined by the inner a little farther away from the middle line, the enclosure thus bounded being filled by the qnadratus lumborum. The fascia resulting from the combination of the three layers gives

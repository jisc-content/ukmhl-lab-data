Then, tlie oecu])ation by the muscle of each successive ])ortion of the great triangular space included by it and the two bones when in Hexion would be an intolerable interference with the usefulness of the limb, practically reducing the carrying power of the front of the forearm to Fig. 260.—Diagram showing the mechanical Fig. 201.—Diagram showing the effect of attaching a disadvantage of tlie points of attachment of limb-muscle at points of the greatest mechanical advau- many muscles. (F. H. G.) tage. (F. H. G.) nothing. There would also be a loss of a great deal of the important liga- mentous work of the muscles by their removal from close contact with the joints during their most pronounced activity. Thus it will be seen that the condition which exists, while extremely costly in the matter of muscular expenditure, is attended with advantages which are more than comjjensatory. Change in Direction of Muscular Force.—Tendons are often made to pass around ])rominences and through loops, the force originating in the muscle, thus experiencing a change of direction, as in the case of a rope which runs from an engine through a pulley to an object which is to })e hoisted. The contractile force of such a muscle is applied in line with the portion of its tendon lying between the last angle which it makes and the point of its attachment to the object to be moved. On account of the lubrication of the tendon by synovia, which is always present in such cases, no appreciable loss of power is experienced by the change of direction.

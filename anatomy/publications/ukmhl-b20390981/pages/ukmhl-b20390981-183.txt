THE SPHENOID BONE. Ill of this groove is bounded on cither side by a bony projection, internally by the peffoml process, which springs from the side of the base of the dorsnm selke and fits against the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and externally by the lingida {" little tongue "), a thin lamella projecting backward between the body and the great wing. The posterior surface is united to the basilar process of the occipital by cartilage in early life, and by bony union in the adnlt. On PTERYGOID NOTCH. HAWIULAR PROCESS. Fig. 197.—The sphenoid bone, viewed from in front. (Testut.) I the anterior surface the vertical sphenoidal cresf projects in the middle line, below , the ethmoidal spine, and articulates with the vertical plate of the ethmoid. On either side, superiorly, are the rounded orifices of the two sphenoidal sinuses,\\\\\c\\ occupy much of the body of the bone. They are unequally divided by a vertical lamina, the sphenoidal septum, continued back from the crest. These openings and the surfaces beneath them are on the roof of the nasal fossae, and the rough surfaces on either side articulate with the lateral masses of the ethmoid above and with the orbital jjrocesses of the jialate bones below. Much of this surface on either side, between the articuhir areas and the crest and below the orifices, is formed by the sphenoidal tarbinaie (" top-shajied ") hones. These are triangular HAMULAFl PROC. Fig. 198.—The sphenoid bone, viewed from behind. (Testut.) ir conical in shape, with the apex directed downward and backward. They are brmed separately, often come away with the ethmoid or palate bones in disarticu- xting, and sometimes appear in the orbit. The iiferior surface presents in front i median ridge, the rostrum ("beak"), continuous with the crest and received etween the alse and the vomer. The surface ou either side forms part of the pof of the pharynx, and is partly covered by the vaginal processes of the inter- 12

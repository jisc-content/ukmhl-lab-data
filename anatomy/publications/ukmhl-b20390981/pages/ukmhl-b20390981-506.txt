The Superficial Cervical Nodes.—The superficial cervical nodes follow the line of the external jugular vein, occupying the posterior triangle of the neck. Their aflerents come from the suboccipital, mastoid, and sul)maxillary nodes, the integu- ment of the neck and that of the external ear. Their eft'erents run to the lower deep cervical. The Suboccipital Nodes lie just below the superior curved line of the occipital bone, taking lymph from the back part of the scalp, and passing it along to the mastoid and superficial cervical nodes. Fig. 518.—The lymph-nodes of the neck and upper p>art of the thorax. (Tcstut.) The Mastoid Nodes are located behind the ear, drain the scalp in that region, and receive efierents from the suboccijiital nodes. Their lymph goes to the sujier- ficial cervical. The Submaxillary Nodes form a chain below and about parallel with the under margin of the mandible. They gather the lymph from the submaxillary and sub- lingual salivary glands, the lips, the front part of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, the nose, the frontal region, and the nasal half of both eyelids. The hucc'ol nodes, which are situated upon the outer surface of the buccinator muscle, interrujit the flow in some of the vessels that bring lymph from the fore part of the fiice. The eiferents of the submaxillary nodes empty into the upjier deep cervical and the superficial cervical. The Suprahyoid Nodes, which lie between the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles, are sometimes counted as belonging to the submaxillary group. They collect lymph from the middle of the lower lip and from the chin, and pour it into the upper deep cervical.

572 THE NERVES. close to the middle line, and nearly corresponding in position to tlie sn]ierior quadrigeminal body. It is just dorsal to the posterior longitudinal fasciculus, which appears to connect it with the nuclei of the seventh and eighth, and with the sixth nucleus of the opposite side. From its nucleus the nerve issues in many small bundles, running ventrally through the posterior longitudinal bundle and red nucleus to the oculo-motor groove, on the inner side of the crus ccreliri just above the pons. The nuclei of both sides communicate freely. The nerve so formed passes between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, forward and a little outward, piercing the dura on the outer side of the poste- rior clinoid process, and so entering the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, in INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY AND SIXTH NERVE OCULO-MOTOR NERVE THOCH LEAR.

(W. Keiller.) which it is embedded (Fig. 634). Between layers of the dura it enters the sphenoidal fissure, having divided into a superior and inferior division. Thus it enters the orbit, passing between the two heads of the external rectus, the two divisions l)eing separated by the nasal nerve. The superior division is directed inward and forward over the optic nerve, and pierces the rectus superior to terminate in the levator palpebrte superioris, sup- plying these two muscles. The inferior division splits into three branches. Of these, one supplies the internal rectus, another the inferior rectus, and the third, larger than either of the

THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. By F. H. GERRISH. THE lymphatic system begins in the microscopic crevices between the cells and fibres of almost all tissues. These diminutive spaces are called " juice channels" or "juice canals," because they are the receptacles of the fluids which exude from the adjacent blood-vessels and tissues. They communicate very freely among themselves, and also with the Ijeginnings of the capillary tubes, which are the radicles of the lymph-vessels, and into the latter they discharge their contents. THE LYMPH-VESSELS. Tlie ]dan upon which the lymphatics are constructed is almost identical with that of the venous system. The small vessels unite and form larger, these in turn act as the radicles of others of still greater size, and after this manner the Fig. .513.—Epithelium lining lymph- Fig. 514.—Lymph-vessel laid open vessel.

There is constant increase in size and diminution in number from the periphery to the centre of the system. But the lymphatics are much smaller than the corresponding veins. Upon the surface of the body frequent plexuses of minute vessels ai'e found, which present an intricate and very delicate reticular ajipearance. All lymph-vessels contain lymph, and those of the small intestine at certain 4S4

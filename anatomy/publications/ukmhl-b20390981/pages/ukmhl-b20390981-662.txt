THE NERVES. 6.34 Between the internal malleolus and the inner tuberosity of the os calcis the posterior tibial divides into the internal and external plantar nerves. Branches.—{a) Muscular branches (5.1., 1. 2. s.) supply the tibialis posterior, flexor longus digitoruni, and tlcxor longus hallucis ; besides M hich there is a sup- plementary braneh to the soleus. (6) The fibular branch accompanies the peroneal artery, su])plying these vessels, the fibular periosteum and the medulla of that bone. GREAT SCIATIC NERVE Fig. 681.—Deep nerves of the back of the leg. (Testut.) (f) The calcaneo-plantar nerve (1. 2. s.), arising from the posterior tibial in the lower fourth of the leg, becomes cutaneous by ])iercing the internal annular liga- ment. It then divides into iidernal calcaneal branches to the skin of the heel, and p/antar cutaneous bi'anches to the inner side of the sole. (d) Articular filaments supply the ankle-joint. The Internal Plantar Nerve' (Figs. 682," 684, 686, 689, 690) (4. -5. 1., 1. s.) is slightly the larger of the two terminal divisions of the posterior tibial. It dis- tributes cutaneous nerves to the inner three and a half toes, and supjjlies the

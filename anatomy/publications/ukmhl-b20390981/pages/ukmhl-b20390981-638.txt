610 THE NER VES. Muscular Branches.—The branch to the pronator teres (6. c.) is given off just above the bend of the elbow, those for the pahiiaris longiis (7. 8. c., 1. th.), flexor carpi radialis (6. c), and flexor sublimis digitorum (7. 8. c., 1. th.) a little lower down. The anterior interosseous nerve (7. 8. e., 1. th.) (Figs. 660, 663) is the muscular Fig. 660 —Deep nerves of the frunt ul tlie right forearm. (Testut.) branch of the median to the deep muscles of the forearm. Commencing opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, it accompanies the anterior interosseous artery and lies on the interosseous membrane between the flexor ])ro- fundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. It supplies branches to both these muscles, that to the flexor ]irofundus communicating with the corresponding branch of the ulnar nerve. The nerve accompanies the artery under the jjronator quadratus ; but, instead of following the vessel through the interosseous mem-

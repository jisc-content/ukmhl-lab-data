THE EPENCEPHALON. 543 The deep fissures divide the entire upper j^ortion of the cerebellum into segments, which are seen most favorably in sagittal sections. For each segment of the ver- mis there is a corresponding and connected part of each hemisphere. These do not appear plainly in the picture (Fig. 600), but -will be understood by reference to the schematic arrangement, in which the segments are named in order from before backward, with the fissures which separate them. The segments of the vermis are the lingula (" little tongue "), the central lobe, the eulmcn (" summit "), the clivus ("slope"), and the cacumen ("top") ; and the parts of the hemisphere respectively corresponding are the frenulum ("little bi'idle"), the ala ("wing"), the anterior or ventral crescentic lobe, the posterior or dorsal crescentie lobe, and TROCHLEAR NERVE CENTRAL LOBE GREAT HORIZON- TAL FISSURE Fir,. 600.—Upper surface of cerebellum.

Here, as on the upper aspect of tlie cerebellum, the deep fissures cut so far into the substance as to mark oflF segments ; but the portions of the hemispheres are less easily seen to be related to correspondent parts of the vermis than in the former case. The fissures are not as regularly disposed, and the whole arrangement is complicated. Close ex- amination, however, reveals a more systematic relation than casual inspection promises, and this is shown diagrammatically in the schematic table, which would

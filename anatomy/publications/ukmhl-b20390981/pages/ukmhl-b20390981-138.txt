Thence it is continued forward and out- ward as the flat, quadrate acromion (" summit of the shoulder") process, over- hanging the shoulder-joint. The upper and lower smooth, concave surfaces of the spine form part of the supra- and infraspinous fossse respectively. Of the two Fig. 158.â€”The right scapula, dorsal view. (Testut.) unattached borders the short, smooth, and concave external border arises at the neck of the scapula, where it bounds the great scapular notch, and is continuous with the under surface of the acromion. The more prominent subcutaneous dorsal border, or erest, is rough, broad, and serpentine. Commencing at the above-men- tioned triangular surfoce, it passes outward to become continuous with the rough, subcutaneous upj)er surface of the acromion. The upper lip of the crest is con- tinuous with the inwr border of the acromion, and to them is attached the trape- zius muscle as far as the oval facet for the outer end of the clavicle, on the inner border of the acromion near its tip. The lower lip of the crest is continuous with the outer border of the acromion, with which it forms an angle, the acromial angle, and from them the deltoid takes origin. The apex of the acromion attaches the coraco-acromial ligament, and its under surface, continuous with the upper surface and outer border of the spine, is smooth and covered by a bursa. The internal or vertebral border (or base) is long and irregulai'ly convex. Opposite the commencement of the spine it bends more sharply, and here attaches the rhomboideus minor muscle, while below this area the rhomboidcus major is attached by a fibrous arch, and above it the levator scapulte is inserted. The sujmior horeler, short, sharp, and concave, extends from the superior angle to the base of the coracoid process, where it presents the suprascapular notch, converted into a foramen by the transvor.se ligament (sometimes by a spicula of bone). The foramen transmits the suprascapular nerve, and from the ligament and the adjacent border the omo-hyoid muscle arises. The external or axillary border is quite thin, and just below the glenoid fossa presents a rough impression, from which the long head of the tricejjs arises. A little below this is a groove for the dorsal artery of the scapula. The long, rounded, thick inferior angle is often called the angle of the scapula.

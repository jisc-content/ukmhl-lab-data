The nerves, derived from a plexus around the uterine and ovarian arteries, are numerous ; but their course and mode of termination are not well known. THE UTERUS. The uterus ov icomb (Figs. 890, 891, 893), a holluw organ with thick, muscular, contractile walls, is situated in the pelvis between the bladder and the rectum. Fig. 893.—Sagittal section of the lower part of a female trunk, right segment. (Testut.) In its cavity the ovum is received, retained, and developed ; and the foetus, after reaching maturity, is (>xpelled chiefly by the contractions of its muscular fibres. External Conformation.—The uterus, in form, resembles a truncated cone, whose base, turned upward, reaches to or a little above the level of the pelvic brim ; and whose summit, directed downward, projects into the upper extremitv of the vagina. It is flattened from before backward, and divided into two parts by a slight circular constriction, called the isfhiiiKs, which corresponds externallv and in front with the point at which the peritoneum is reflected from the uterus to the bladder, while internally it coincides with a narrowing of the uterine canal, known as the internal os. In virgins the isthmus is a little below the middle of

439 THE ARTERIES. The pubic winds around the inner margin of the femoral ring, and anastomoses with a similar branch from the obturator. Muscular branches are distributed to the muscles of the abdominal wall. The Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery arises from the outer surface of the external iliac just above Poupart's ligament. It runs upward and outward, covered by the transversalis fascia, to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. It then runs along the crest of the ilium to about its centre, pierces the abdominal muscles, and breaks \\]) into branches supplying them. Fig. 477.â€”Femoral artery. iTestut.) The Femoral Artery (Fig. 477). The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac opposite the inguinal ligament, about midway between the superior anterior spine and the symphysis pubis. It passes down the anterior and inner side of the thigh and terminates at the opening in the adductor magnus muscle by becoming the pop- liteal. In about the upper half of its course it lies in a surgical region called

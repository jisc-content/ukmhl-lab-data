THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 450 the second and tliird, the thh'd and fourth, the fourth and fifth. The contiguous sides of the great toe and second toe will be found, in the description of the dorsalis pedis, to be supplied by its deep plantar branch. Opposite the web of the toes each digital branch gives olf a perforating artery, which anastomoses with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The Anterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 486). The antmor tibial a^iery begins at the bifurcation of the popliteal, at the lower border of the popliteus muscle. It passes between the heads of origin of the tibialis posterior muscle, above the upper border of the interosseous membrane, to the anterior surface of the leg, runs downward on the ante- rior surface of the interosseous mem- brane, accompanied by the anterior tibial nerve and venae comites, and in a position external to the til)ialis anterior muscle, to the bend of the ankle. Here the vessel becomes the dorsalis pedis. ANTERIOR TIBIAL RECURRENT ANTERIOR TIBH NERVE ANTERIOR PERONEAL EXTERNAL MALLEOLAR Relations of the Anterior Tibial Artery. In front.

Fig. i8G.—Anterior tilnal artery, (lestut Variations.—The anterior tibial may be very small, or absent, its place being taken by branches from the posterior tibial or peroneal. It has been seen to accompany the mus- culo-cutaneous nerve, winding around the fibula to reach the front of the leg. Surgical Anatomy (Fig. 487).—In amputations of the leg the anterior tibial is ligated. It should be noted that it lies in front of the interosseous membrane, and external to the tibialis anterior, and that it is accompanied by venje comites and the anterior tibial nerve. The anterior tibial can be ligated at any part of its course through an incision along the line of the outer border of the tibialis anterior muscle. This incision should divide the skin, superficial and deep fasciie. The outer border of the tibialis anterior is found ; this muscle is then separated from the two other muscles on the front of the leg : the extensor longus digitorum and

705 THE MOUTH. Method of Displacement of Temporary Teeth.—The temporary teeth are replaced by the permanent in the following; manner : the tooth which is to succeed the deciduous tooth is j)ushed ujiward by the continual growth of the dentine of its fang. Its enamel is crowded against the root of the milk-tooth, cuts otf its nutri- tion, and, by tlie incessant pressure of its dense substance upon the less hard materials composing the root of the tooth above, causes the latter to dwindle away, particle by particle, the molecules disa]i]icaring by aljsorption, until all of UPPER MOLARS OF RIGHT SIDE FRONT SURFACE FIRST SECOND THIRD FRONT SURFACE LOWER MOLARS OF RIGHT SIDE Fig. 753.—The mular tL'ctU—tlieir front and grinding surfacus. (Testut.) the root has vanished, and the only support of the crown is that afforded by the adhesion of the gum to the neck. Then the crown is knocked off by some slight force, and in its place appears that of its permanent successor. A\nien the ]ier- manent tooth is not aimed accurately at the root of the temporary, l)ut shoots by it, the latter remains undisturbed.

A j portion of the alveolar process grows around its base, and furnishes a snug .socket for it ; but, in spite of its density and the solidity of its implantation, it is com- parable with otiier jjapilke, such as that of a hair-follicle. The changes in the epithelium of the hair-papilla are unlike those which take place in that of the tooth-])apilla, and, consequently, the result is very diiferent, although in both cases the modification is in the direction of hardening; but, philosophically con- 45

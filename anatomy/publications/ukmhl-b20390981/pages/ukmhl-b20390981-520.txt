It is iter a fctiio ad (piaiium vcnfricuilinn (" the passage from the third to the fourth ventricle"), a name with the merit of descriptiveness, but with the fault of tiresome length.

The carifi/ of tlie mydon or spinal cord retains its original, cylindrical shape, and is called the central canal of the sjnnal cord. It is continuous at its cephalic end with the f)urtli ventricle. The preceding diagrams have been drawn as if all of the vesick'S were upon the same plane, for the sake of simplicity ; but, during their synchronous development, a marked FIFTH VESICLE Cavity of spinal cord Fir.. 544.—Diagram of changes in fifth vesicle—view from left side. curve with a ventral concavity takes place at about the junction of the third ventricle and the aqueduct, and thus the long axis of the spinal cord is brought nearly to a right angle with the plane of the lateral ventricles. Tlie description of the encephalic vesicles here given is not designed for a portrayal of the process which is discovered by em- bryological research, but is intended merely to present in a diagrammatic manner the main features of tiie results which are brofp"na?axis^?iewVom''ato^^ reached by the developmental process. The shape and relative size of these different cavities, wlien fully formed, can be seen in Fig. 546, which represents a cast, made by filling them with a liquid material, which solidified on standing. The surrounding solid tissue being I'emoved, we obtain a perfect cast of the general t^cnti-ieidar cavity, as the combined chambers and tubes of the encephalou are called. V

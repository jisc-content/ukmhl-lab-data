THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 378 The veins are more numerous tlian the arteries, and the capacity of the venous system is considerably greater than that of the arterial. The veins have a structure, which in the main, is like that of the arteries ; hut there are such variations of detail that, in some resjjects, the two sets of vessels l)ehave very diiferently. The inner coat is essentially like the arterial intima, with the addition of numerous transverse folds, which, strengthened by plates of white tiln'ous tissue, form valves (Fig. 438). The middle funic is thinner than that of the arteries of comparable size, contains less muscle, more white fibrous, and only a little yellow fibrous tissue. The external coat is very like that of the arteries. This combination results in vessels which are very strong, capable of sustaining more strain than arteries without giving way, but so flabby that they collapse when emptied of PLEXUS Fig. 437.—Diagram, showing the formation of large veins bv convergence of small, and the branching of veins.

(Testut.) blood ; whereas arteries, stiffened as they are with elastic and a large amount of muscular tissue, stand ojien in similar circumstances. The valves are not found in all veins. They generally have two flaps each, which are directed toward the heart, when open. At the base of each valve the vein bulges, forming a sinus, into which the blood enters as soon as any obstruc- tion to its flow occurs, and causes instant closure of the valve. A few exceptions are found to the rule that capillaries intervene between arterioles and venules. In the interior of erectile organs small arteries may open directly into venous cavities ; and in the spleen the arteries discharge into the interstices of the organ.

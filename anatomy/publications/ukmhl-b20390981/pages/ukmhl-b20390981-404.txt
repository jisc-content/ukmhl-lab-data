An incision fonr inches in length is made on the inner border of the sterno-cleido- mastoid, extending to the sterno-clavicular ai'ticulation. A second incision of the same length is made over the clavicle parallel with it, meeting the first incision. These incisions divide the skin, superficial fascia, and platysma myoid ^SUBMAXILLARY GLAND STYLO-HYOIDEUS AND DIGASTRICUS -DESCENOENS HYPO- GLOSSI NERVE 'OMOHYOIDEUS STERNO-THYROIDEUS STERNO-HYOIDEUS TRANSVERSE JUGULAR VEIN AXILLARY VEIN ANTERIOR THORACIC NERVES SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY PECTOHALIS MINOR DELTOIDCUS INTERCOSTALIS INTERNUS PLEURA STERNUM PECTORALIS MAJOR INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY I Fig. 442.â€”Surgical ix-laiimis tiT tln' lingual, external carotid, Common carotid, brachio-cephalic, subclavian, and internal mammary arteries.

This should be divided completely across at a point one and a half inches above the sternum, and the lower part turned downward and held out of the way. The sterno-thyroid and sterno-hyoid muscles come now into view, and are divided in the same wa3^ This usually exposes the inferior thyroid veins, which are either carefully pushed out of the way, or are ligated at two ]ioints, and divided. The common carotid is now exposed, and followed downward until the brachio-cephalic is reached. The left brachio-cephalic vein crosses the artery in the lower half of its course, the

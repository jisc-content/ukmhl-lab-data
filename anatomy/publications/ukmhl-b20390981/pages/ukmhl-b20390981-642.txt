THE NERVES. 614 10. The Musculo-spiral Nerve. The musculo-spiral ucrve (6. 7. <S. c.) (Figs. 664, 659, 662, 666, 667) is the ter- minal and largest branch of the posterior cord. Placed at first behind the third part of the axillary artery and upper part of the brachial, it soon leaves the latter vessel, and, accompanied by the superior profunda artery, pierces the internal ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS Fig. 663.â€”Deep palmar nerves. (Testut.) intermuscular septum, winds obliquely round the humerus in the spiral groove between the triceps and the bone, and reaching tlie external intermuscular septum, pierces it to gain the interval between the brachialis anterior and brachio-radialis, where it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves. Before its final division it gives oif an internal and an external cutaneous, and muscular branches to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anterior (6. c), brachio-radialis (6. c), and extensor carpi radialis longus (6. 7. c). Of the muscular branches those to the last three muscles are given otf between the brachio-radialis and brachialis

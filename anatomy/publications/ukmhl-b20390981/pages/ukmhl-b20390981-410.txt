THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTE3L 394 nal carotid below the hyoid l)one. Course and termination : it runs at first ujnvard and inward, and then cnrves downward and inward beneath the onio-hyoid, sterno-liyoid, and sterno-thyroid mnscles to the npj^er portion of the lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, to which it is distributed. Relations.-—The superior thyroid at its origin is superficially situated and covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia ; before it reaches Fig. 446.—Surgical relations of the external carotid, lingual, facial, occipital, subclavian, and transversalis colli arteries. (Kocher.) the thyroid gland it becomes more deeply situated by passing beneath the omo- hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid vessels. Varieties.—The superior thyroid is sometimes given off as a branch of the common carotid, and sometimes is a branch of a trunk from the external carotid, common to it and the lingual or facial. Surgical Anatomy.—The superior thj^roid can be ligated close to its origin from the external carotid through the same incision described in Hgating the external carotid in the lower part of its course. This operation is sometimes done to limit the blood-supply of an enlarged thyroid gland, or in cases of exophthalmic goitre. The artery is ligated in the operation of extirpation of the thyroid.

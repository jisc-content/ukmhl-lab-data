653 THE SKIN. (wliich includes the four deep layers to be described) and a superficial, horny layer. Next to the trUe skin is a single layer of co/vvinar ('(//s', the parent cells of the rest; then come polyhedral cell>< to a considerable depth, each communicating with its neighbors by strands of protoplasm, giving them a prickly appearance (hence the term " prickle cells "). This stratum is covered by two thin strata, which ex- hibit changes antecedent to their assuming the characters of the horny layer, namely the stratum (/ranulosuia and the strat'iim lucklum. Their peculiar ap]iear- ance is due to a progressive accumulation in droplets of a substance called eleidin. Superimposed on these is the horny layer {stj-atmn corneum), the cells of which become gradually more flattened toward the surface, lose their nuclei, and have their substance converted into keratin. During life the superficial cells of this layer are being constantly shed and renewed from those beneath. The pigment in the skin of the negro, as well as that of the nipple and elsewhere in white races, is found in the deepest cells of the Malpighian layer. The True Skin {eutis vera, derma, corium) consists of a fibrous matrix with vessels, lymphatics, and nerves embedded therein. It blends gradually with the superficial fascia, in which, with the exception of that on the ])enis, scrotum, labia minora, and eyelids, clusters of fat cells are accumulated. This loose areolar sul)cutaneous layer enables the skin to move freely on the deep fascia. The true skin is formed of interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue with numerous elastic fibres and connective-tissue corpuscles. In connection with the hairs, and in the cutis vera of the sei'otum, penis, pei'ineum, areola of the nipple, and the nipple itself, smooth muscular fibres are found in fasciculi. The free surface of the corium is raised to form the ridges already described as seen on the surface of the skin, and on their summits simple and cdmpound j>flpy7/(r are developed, which are received into i)its on the deep surface of the cuticle (Fig. 697). These papillas are most numerous where sensation is most acute, as on the Fig. 697.â€”Papillae of the skin.

Some of these papillre have vascular loops prolonged into them, some have touch-corpuscles (Fig. 61>8). The bloodvessels of the skin are found in the cutis vera only. They form a capillary network from which branches pass to the hairs, glands, and fat, and capillary loops project into the papillae. The lymphatics form a deep and super-

A con- striction now begins to form in the inner wall of the sac (Fig. 129), dividing it into an upper and a lower portion ; and from the upper portion two flat hollow disc- like outgrowths develop, one of which lies in a horizontal plane, while the other is directed vertically, but is bent so that the anterior half of it lies al- most at right angles with the posterior. These are the anlagen of the semicir- cular canals (Fig. 130), which are finally formed from the edges of the discs, the central ptn-tion of the horizontal disc and of each half of the vertical one disap- pearing, so that three canals are formed, each opening at both extremities into the upper portion of the auditory sac. At one end of each canal a widening occurs, and, from the mode of devel- opment just outlined, it will be seen that the two vertical canals will be united together at one end to form a common canal before opening into the sac (Fig. 131). The constriction of the wall of the sac deepens gradually, until finally the up]ier portion, or ufriculus, communicates witji the lower portion, or sacciiliis, only b_y a slender canal, which represents that portion of the original sac with which the ductus endolymphaticus communicates. While these processes have been going on, a second constriction has formed between tlie cochlear anlage and the sacculus, whereby the connection of these two parts is also reduced to a slender canal, the canalis reuniens. In correspondence with this division of the original sac a division of the auditory ganglion also occurs, one portion of it, the vestibular Fig. 128.—Section through the auditory vesicle of a sheep embryo.

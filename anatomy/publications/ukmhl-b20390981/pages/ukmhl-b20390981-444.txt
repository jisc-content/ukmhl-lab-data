THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 428 Surgical Anatomy.—The position of the hepatic artery and its relation to the common bile-duct and the portal vein nuist be carefully studied in operations on the common duct. These structures all lie in the free edge of the small omentum, which bounds the foramen of Winslow in front. The common duct is in front, the hepatic artery is to the left, and the ])ortal vein is behind. Branches.—The branches of the hepatic are the pyloric, the gastro-duodenalis, and the cystic arteries. The jji/lo/-ic branch passes to the pyloric end of the stomach, anastomosing with the pyloric branches from the gastric artery. The gadro-duodcnalis is a short, large vessel which passes downward and to the right Fig. 471.—Arteries of the stomach, liver, and great omentum. (Testut.) between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, and divides into the gastro- epiploica dextra and the superior ])ancreatico-duodenalis. The gastro-epiploica dcxira, a vessel of large size, winds from right to left along the great curvature of the stomach between the folds of the great omentum, sujiplies the stomach and anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica sinistra of the splenic. The mpcrior pan- crcnfico-diiodenalis, a small vessel, winds downward between the head of the pan- creas and the duodenum, supplying these structures and anastomosing Avith the ptuicreatico-duodenalis inferior of the superior mesenteric. The cystic artery or arteries are usually branches of the right he])atic ; they supply the gall-bladder. The Splenic Artery is the largest branch of the ca?liac axis ; it runs from right

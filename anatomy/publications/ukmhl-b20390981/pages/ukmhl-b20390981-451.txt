THE ARTERIES. 435 in close contact with the iliac vein, and, therefore, would be external to a femoral hernia. In a small proportion of cases it winds along the inner border of the femoral ring and would be internal to a femoral hernia. In operations for the relief of strangulated femoral hernia this possibility must be borne in mind. The Internal Pudic Artery (Figs. 474—476) is one of the terminal branches into which the anterior trunk of the internal iliac divides, the other being the sciatic. The internal pudic supplies the perineum and the external genitals. It is larger in the male than in the female. The internal pudic leaves the pelvis Fig. 475—Arteries of the back ot the iiip and thigh. (Testut.) through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis muscle, winds over the spine of the ischium, enters the pelvis again through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, runs in a groove along the ascending ramus of the ischium, entex's the perineum, and breaks up into branches, which supply the perineum and the exter- nal genital organs. Variations.—The most frequent variation is the occurrence of an accessory pudic branch, which runs to the anterior angle of the outlet of the pelvis below the symphysis pubis, perforates the triangular ligament, and supplies branches to the external genitals.

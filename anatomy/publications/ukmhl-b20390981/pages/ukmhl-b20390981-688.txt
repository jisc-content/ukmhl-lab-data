THE TONGUE. By F. H. GERRISH. EPIGLOTTIS I CIRCUIM- VALLATE PAPILL/E THE tongue has various functions. It is necessary for articulate speech, per- forms valuable service in the pi'ocesses of mastication and deglutition, possesses tactile sensibility to a high degree, and is the principal organ of taste. It is only in its sensory relations that it will be considered in this place. Its other features will be de- "^"'â– * scribed in connection Avith the other parts of the mouth and pharynx. The mucoaa of tJie dor- sum (Fig. 706) is the only part of the tongue having gustatory capacity. The anterior two-thirds of this surface presents in the mouth, the posterior third in the pharynx, the bound- ary between the two being marked by a line of large projections, the circumvul- late papi/ke, arranged like an inverted V, with widely spread branches. The oral imrt of the dorsum is besprinkled with smaller jjrocesses, the fiinf/iform papillae, and elsewhere this surface is completely covered with closely set ranks of a third variety, the f Iiform papilkp, marshalled for the most part, especially behind, in lines nearly parallel on each side with the circum- vallate. The pharyngeal j>arf of the dorsum is occupied by mucous glands, and small lymphoid masses, struct- urally similar to the tonsils, and arranged in lines parallel with the circumvallate papillte. The Circumvallate (" walled-around ") Papillas (Fig. 707) vary in number from seven to twelve. The base of each is broad, its summit wider still. Its core is a prolongation of the corium of the mucous membrane, and many secondary (IfiO Dorsal surface of the tongue. (Testut.)

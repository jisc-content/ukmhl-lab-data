THE MUSCLES. 290 The flexors of the thigh arise partly from the luinhar vertebrae, partly from the inner surface of the false pelvis, and are inserted u])on the small trochanter. The great exfen.sor arises from the back part of the hip-bone, sacrum, and coccyx, and is inserted into the small trochanter and the fascia lata. The abductors, which are also internal rotators, arise from the outer aspect of the hiji-bone, and are inserted into the great trochanter and the neighboring fascia lata. The adductors arise from the hip-bone near the middle line of the body, and four of the five pass outward and d(.)wnward with vaiying degrees of oljliquity to their insertion into the back part of the shaft of the femur, the fifth one going below the knee-joint to the upper part of the tibial shaft. They are to a con- siderable extent external rotators. The external rotators arise jiartly from the inside and partly from the outside of the bony pelvis, and are all inserted about the upper end of the femur.

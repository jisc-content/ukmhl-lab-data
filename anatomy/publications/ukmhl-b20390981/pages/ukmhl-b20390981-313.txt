MUSCLES 310 VING THE LEG. 303 tibia. Action, flexion and inward rotation of the leg. Nerve, the internal popliteal. Quadriceps Extensor Cruris.—" The four-headed extensor of the leg." Syno- nym, quadriceps extensor fenioris, " the four-headed extensor of the thigh"—a misleading name considered from the phys- iological point of view, because this muscle does not extend the thigh. Genered Descriptiem.—Three of the four heads arise from the femur, one from the ilium. Each segment is described as a separate muscle, but all unite in a common tendon of insertion, which is attached to the tubercle of the tibia. The lowest part of this tendon is usually called the Uga- mentimi patelleB ; but, philosophically con- sidered, it is tendon rather than ligament, and the patella is only a sesamoid bone developed in it, exactly as such osseous formations appear in the short flexor ten- dons of the great toe. The iliac part of the quadriceps is distinct from the rest nearly to the patella ; but the others are more or less blended, and enclose the shaft Fig. 351.—Semitendinosus of right side: outline and attachment-areas.

THE BONES. 122 ments, and ends in a projection, the inferior lateral angle, below which there is a notch, converted into a foramen by ligaments from the coccyx. Through this foramen passes the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. The sacral fipinal canal curves and narrows with the bone. It is triangular above on trans- verse section, flattened or semilunar below, and lodges the lower end of the cauda equina and filum terminale with tlie spinal dura. Peculiarities and Varieties.—The second and third sacral vertebrje represent the sacrum of mammals—the fourth and fifth the first two caudal vertebra^ while the first represents the sixth lumbar of most quadrupeds. This explains the occasional partial or complete separation, and the transitional and partly lumbar character of the first sacral, not rarely present. The large number of sacral vertebrae in man is associated with his upright position. The sacrum some- times consists of six segments, more rarely of only four. In the former instance the first coccygeal is usually included. The breadth of the sacrum as compared with its length is re- markably great in man as compared with mammals, and especially so in the European specimens.

These consist of little else than bodies tapering in size from above downward, so as to give the bone a triangular outline. They are ankylosed together, and oftentimes with the sacrum, in advanced life ; but in middle life, especially in the female, the first is movable on the succeeding thi'ee and on the fifth sacral, with which it is united by fibro-cartilage.

524 THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. occasionally referred to as the extraventricular portion of the corpus striatum. The claustrum is a plate of gray substance, embedded between the lenticular nucleus and the insula. The amygdaloid nucleus is a collection of gray matter near the apex of the temporal lobe. The Caudate Nucleus. The caudate (" tailed ") nucleus protrudes into the cavity of the lateral ven- tricle at the fore part of the i\oor, the anterior horn curving forward and outward around its most prominent ])ortion (Fig. 57(3). The front end is rounded, and faces upward, forward, and inward. From this large beginning the nucleus diminishes in size as it is traced backward, and hence the most conspicuous part of it is pear- shaped. But the stem of the pear—the tail or cauda, which gives its name to Fig. 576.—Lateral and third ventricles from above. The fornix and velum interpositnm have been removed. EPI., epiphysis. M. C, middle commissure. P. C, posterior commissure. (Testut.) the nucleus—stretches backward and outward as a slender prolongation through the l)ody of the ventricle to the rear end, and thence in a swee])ing curve into the middle horn and even to its extremity, clinging to the roof of the cornu (Fig. 575). It thus describes almost a circle, the tip of it reaching a jioint nearly underneath the blunt beginning. As it embraces in its loop a considerable mass of brain-tissue, it has been named the surcingle. It is not of regular outline, but is alternately and unevenly constricted and enlarged (Fig. 578). The caudate nucleus ends in the amygdala at the front end of the temjjoral lobe. Along the inner border of the caudate nucleus is a band of fibres, which may fairly be regarded as its projier edge. It is called the frenia semicircularis (" the half-circle ribbon ") (Figs. 576, 550). It accompanies the tail of the nucleus in the I'oof of the middle horn even to the amygdala. In the body of the ventricle it is covered by the vein of the corpus striatinn.

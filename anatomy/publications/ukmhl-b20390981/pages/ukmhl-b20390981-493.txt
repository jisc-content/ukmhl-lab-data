THE VEINS. 477 The External Iliac Vein (Fig. 506). This is the continuation of the femoral vein, and extends from the level of the inguinal (Poupart's) ligament to the sacro-iliac articulation, where it joins tlio internal iliac vein. "While it is internal to the artery on Ijoth sides below, on the Fig. 506.â€”ExternaT iliac vein of right side. (Testut.) right side above it inclines beliind it. It contains one or two valves, and just above the inguinal ligament it receives the deep epigastric and the deep circumflex ihac veins, which accompany the corresponding arteries. A pubic vein, cor- responding to the pubic branch of the obturator artery, ascends from the obturator vein to join the external iliac vein, and sometimes forms the main outlet of the obturator vein. The Portal System of Veins (Fig. 507). Tlie.se are distinguished from other veins by beginning and ending in capil- laries. The portal vein collects the blood from the chylopoietic viscera (the stomach, intestines, and pancreas), as Avell as from the spleen and the gall-bladder, and conveys it to the liver, to the capillaries of which it is distributed to be collected, together with the blood from the he])atic arterv, by the hepatic veins, and so carried to the vena cava. The veins of this system have no valves. The Portal Vein {vena portai) (Fig. 508) is formed by the union of the splenic and the superior mesenteric veins, behind the upper end of the head of the pancreas, in front of the vena cava, and opposite the right side of the body of the first lumbar vertebra. From this point it runs upward and somewhat to the right for about three inches, to near the right end of the transverse fissure of the liver. Here it is somewhat enlarged (sinus of the portal vein), and divides into right and left branches, which enter their respective lobes and divide into

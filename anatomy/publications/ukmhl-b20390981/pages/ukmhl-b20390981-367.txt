THE CERVICAL FASCIA. 351 THE CERVICAL FASCIA. Tlie deep fascia of the neck is conveniently divided for description into three portions : the outer or superficial, the middle, and the inner or deep, all of which, however, are continuous (Fig. 408). The Outer Cervical Fascia. The outei^ portion forms a firm investment for the organs of the neck, its shape being suggestive of a hollow cylinder. Its upper limit extends from the MYLO-HYOID external occipital ^protuberance to the lower part of the symphysis of the mandible, attaching itself to the series of skeletal prominences most nearly coinciding with a line drawn around the head and inter- secting these points. Below it is fastened to the sternum, clavicle, acromion, and scapular spine, beyond the last named losing itself in the fascia of the back. Thus it includes, especially in its lower parts, somewhat more than the strict anatomical neck. It is at- tached" behind to the ligamentum nuchse, and in front it is continuous across the middle line. In its course around the side of the neck it splits twice, first embracing the trapezius, and then the sterno-mastoid, form- ing strong sheaths for these muscles. Traced from below upward in the region in front of the sterno-mastoid, it is found to be attached to the hyoid, from which it runs to its upper limit on the lower border of the mandible (Fig. 409). From the hyoid insertion it sends to the internal oblique line of the mandible u lamella, which lines the "MANDIBLE Fig. -109.â€”The outer cervical fascia between the hyuid and mandible. (Testut.)

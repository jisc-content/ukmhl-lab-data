372 THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. the right auricle ; below by the antero-inferior border, which separates it from the inferior surface, and is so sharp that it is called margo acutus ; on the left by the left border, on the marked convexity of the left ventricle ; and above by the line of junction of the pulmonary artery with the heart, and by the upper margin of the appendixes. The Dorsal Surface (Fig. 431) is irregularly convex, looks backward, and pi'e- sents the greater part of the left auricle. Above are the horizontallv directed primary divisions of tlie pulmonary artery, the right and left pulmonary arteries ; at the right the posterior interauricular groove ; below, the auriculo-ventricular Fig. 4:30.â€”Front view of the heart. The auriculo-ventricular and anterior interventricular grooves and the vessels in them are not labelled, but cannot be mistaken. (From the His cast. F. H. G.) groove ; at the left a line leading downward from the left pulmonary veins, commonly marked by the oblique vein (of Marshall), which ends below in the coronary sinus. The Right Surface is convex, quadrilateral, and exhibits nearly all of the right auricle which is not included in the ventral surface. At the postero-inferior angle the vena cava inferior enters, and the vena cava superior is seen above. Behind is tbe posterior interauricular groove ; below, the auriculo-ventricular groove ; and in front is the right border, already mentioned. The Left Surface is unevenly convex and somewhat triangular. It presents above and bclu'nd a part of the left auricle, and in front, of this a portion of its appendix ; below, the left ventricle, tapering to the apex, and showing in the

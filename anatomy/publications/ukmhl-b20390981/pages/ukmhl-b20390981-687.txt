THE SKIN. 659 The Sweat-Glands (Fig. 695). Except in the depths of the external auditory meatus and on the tympanic membrane, sweat-glands are found over the whole integument. They are most numerous on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, 2800 to the square inch ; on the back of the neck and trunk there are only 400 to 600 in the same urea. They vary much in size, being largest in the axilla and groin. Krause estimates their total number as about two millions. A swvat-glund is an invaginated, epithelial tube, which sinks through the cor- ium into the subcutaneous fatty tissue, and there coils up into a ball. Thus it is a simple tubular gland, the coiled-up extremity being the secreting portion, the straight tube its excretory duct. In the epidermis the chid is a simple channel with no detinite walls, and where the horny layer is thick it twists in cork-screw fashion. As it passes througii the corium, the duct derives from it a richly vascular fibrous coat, within which is a basement membrane. The duct, much smaller tlian the coiled, secreting portion of the tube, is lined by small poly- hedral cells, two deep, whose free surface is condensed into an appearance sug- gesting a delicate cuticle. In the secreting segment a layer of smooth muscular fibres, longitudinally arranged, is placed next the basement membrane, and on this a single layer of columnar cells with nuclei near their attached extremities. The ceruminous glands of the ear and the glands of Moll in the eyelid are modi- fied sweat-glands. Tlie sweat-glands in the axilla and round the anus and, of course, the ceruminous glands have an oily secretion; the rest secrete a colorless, slightly tui'bid, aqueous fluid, the perspii'ation.

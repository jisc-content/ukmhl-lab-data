616 THE NERVES. The posterior interosseous nerve (6. 7. c.) (Fig. 665), which is the terminal muscular hrandi of tlie nuiseiilo-spiral, is destined for the ])ostenor group of forearm niiiscles. It descends l)et\veen the braehialis anterior and extensor carpi radialis k>ngus, where it gives branches to the extensor carpi radialis brevis and supinator (6. 7. c), and tlien enters the substance of the latter muscle, in which it winds round the radius to gain the interval between the superficial and deep Fig. 665.â€”Posterior interosseous nerve. (Testut.) muscles on the back of the forearm. Here it distributes twigs to all the sur- rounding extensors (7. c.) and passes to the interosseous membi'ane in the lower third of the forearm, where it joins the anterior interosseous artery. It descends beneath the posterior annular ligament under the extensor communis, and expands into a gangliform enlargement, from which branches are supplied to the carpal joints. The radial nerve (6. c.) (Figs. 660, 661, 662, 666, 667) is the other terminal division of the rausculo-spiral, and is pui'ely cutaneous in its distribution. It

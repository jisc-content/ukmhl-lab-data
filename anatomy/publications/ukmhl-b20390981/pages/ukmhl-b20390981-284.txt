The separated halves become united behind the tendon of the deep flexor, opposite the base of the second phalanx, but almost immediately sepai'ate again, and are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx. The tendons are bound down to the phalanges by a ligamentous sheath. Action, primary, flexion of the second phalanges; secondary, flexion of first phalanges. Nerve, the median.

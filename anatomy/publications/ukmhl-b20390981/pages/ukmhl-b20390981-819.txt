THE URETHRA. 79] Structure of the Urethra.â€”The inner coat of the uretlira is mucous membrane, continuous above with that of the bladder, below with the skin. It is unusually rich in elastic fibres. It has, most markedly in the spongy portion, fine longi- tudinal folds, which are effiiced during urination. The tube does not stand open, like the trachea or a severed artery, but opposite surfixces (generally the front and rear) of mucosa are in contact. The epithelium of the prostatic portion is similar to the vesical; in most other parts it is a simple columnar, but for a quarter inch back from the meatus it is of the flattened variety and stratified. Tiie corium is plentifully studded with small jiapillfe. Mucous follicles and race- mose glands are practically everywhere proximal to the navicular fossa. There are also many openings which were formerly thought to belong to glandular structures, but have been ascertained to be blind depressions obliquely set in the I mucosa, their mouths always directed toward the external meatus (Fig. 863). They are lacunce, "little lakes," and are found in the free spongy portion, proxi- mal to the fossa navicularis, in two sets, large and small. The large are one- third inch deep and occur in a single, median row in the anterior (upper) wall ; the small are located principally in the anterior surface and at the sides in

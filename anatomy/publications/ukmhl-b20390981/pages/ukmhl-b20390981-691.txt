THE NOSE. Bv W. KEILLER. THE nofie is the organ of the sense of smell. It forms on the face a prominence partly honv, partly cartilaginous. Its root springs from the naso-frontal groove, except in the Grecian type, where the dorsum of the nose is in a straight line with the forehead. The mesial ridge is called the dorswin, of which the upper bony segment forms the bridge. It ends below in the tip, which is continuous with the horizontal free edge of the septum, called the colnmna nasi. The sides of the nose form an angle with the face, which increases as it descends (the naso- facial angle). The rounded, lateral boundary of the nostril is called the aJa. The Nasal Cavity consists of two fossa', separated from each other by a mesial septinn. They open anteriorly by the two nostrils or anterior nares, and posteriorly by the posterior nares or ehoana: (" funnels") into the u])per part of the pharynx. The anterior nares are guarded l)y hairs, vibrissce, which spring from their inner surface. Each expands into a smooth-walled, front chamber called the vestibule, the rest of the nasal cavity being divisilde into three channels called meatuses. The width of the nostrils bears in different races a very varying relation to its length measured vertically. The skin of the nose is fine and movable over the bony part, thick, adherent, and closely studded with large sebaceous glands over the tip and alte.

(Testut.) are derived from the ophthalmic and focial, and, being terminal, readily indicate the state of circulation. The lymphatics drain into the sulimaxillarv nodes. The sensor}/ nerves are derived from the infratrochlear, nasal, and infraorbital branches of the fifth ; the motor nerves from the seventh. The muscles have been described among the muscles of the face.

THE VEIXS. 473 are consti'icted, and send lateral branches through the intervertebral foramina to join the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, or sacral veins according to the region. They communicate with the basilar plexus above, and with the posterior spinal veins throughout the spinal canal. Together with the jjosterior spinal veins and the marginal part of the occipital sinus they form a venous ring around the foramen magnum. The Posterior Longitudinal Spinal Veins, smaller than the foregoing, are situated one on each side at the back of the spinal canal, and extend throughout Fig. 502.—Veins of the spine, seen in a transverse horizontal section of a thoracic vertebra. (Testut.) its entire length. They communicate with one another, by frequent transverse branches in front of the vertebral arches, with the dorsal spinal veins through the ligamenta subflava, with the anterior spinal veins by lateral branches, and above with the occipital sinus. Lateral branches also pass out through the interverte- bral foramina to join those from the anterior spinal veins. Fig. 503.—Veins of the spine, seen in a sagittal section of two thoracic vertebra. (Testut.) (B) The Veins of the Spinal Cord, of small size, run tortuously in the pia of the cord, and are disposed in longitudinal trunks over the median fissures and laterally, with plexiform communications between. Branches accompany the nerve-roots to the intervei'tebral foramina, where they join the lateral branches from the veins of the spinal canal. Above they join the veins of the pons and cerebellum. The principal blood-current througli tlie veins of the spine is probably in a horizontal direction in the venous rinirs, formed bv the communications between

556 THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. tiiiuoiis around the head of the ventral horn, except for the interrnpti<jn occa- sioned by the passage of the ventral roots from the surface to the ventral horn. They are often called the fundamental tracts, or ground tracts of their respective columns ; but a simpler and more instructive name is the ventro-lateral associa- tion tract—an aiijwllation which indicates at once the location and the service of the structure, wliosc function is to connect parts of the cord situated at different levels. The association tracts are found in the whole length of the cord, and are subject to but slight variations of size. In the dorsal column are two tracts, separated from each other by a line run- ning from the dorso-intermediate fissure to u point near the junction of the neurogliar septum and the gray commissure. Tiiese tracts, then, correspond exactly to the dorso-mesial and the dorso-lateral cohunns, and are called respec- FiG. fil7.—Diagram to show the crossing of the pyramids Fa;, tils.—Transverse seetions of (red) and of the lemniscus (blue).

The Goll tract increases in size as it ascends; the Burdach tract varies but little from its average at different levels. Finally, at the dorso-lateral fissure is a small irregidar area, the ivarf/inal hniuUe, called also by the names of the men who simultaneously described it, the i^p ifzka-L i.^sa iter tract.

The nomenclature emjjloyed is that in general use among English-s])eaking anatomists. A few words, sanctioned by the approval of the Association of American Anatomists, or the Anatomische Gesellschaft, or both, have been used in preference to the customary, though less desii-able, terms ; but, in every such case, the synonym is given, so that no confusion can arise. When a term, which has not been employed previous]}' in the text, is intro- duced, its etymologic meaning is given parenthetically, unless its signification is manifest without such assistance. By this means a new and helpful aspect of the topic is often presented to the mind. The articles on the bones, the joints, and the veins have been written Ijy Dr. Woolsey, those on the peripheral nervous system, the eye, the nose, and the skin by Dr. Keiller, that on embryology by Dr. McMurrich, that on the arteries by Dr. Bevan, that on the reproductive organs by Dr. Stewart, and the remainder by Dr. Gerrish.

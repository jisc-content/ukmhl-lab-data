THE ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. 625 perforate the deep fascia half way down tlie thigh, and supply the skin in front as far down as the knee-joint, joining the plexus patellar. {e) The internal cutaneous nerve (Figs. 675, 685, 686, 688, 690) crosses ob- liquely over the superficial femoral artery in Scarpa's triangle, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, which follow the anterior and posterior borders of the sartorius respectively. They pierce the fascia lata in the lower third of the thigh and supply the skin on its inner aspect as low as the knee. The ante- rior branch joins the plexus patelloe, and the posterior branch the subsartorial plexus. Fig. 673.â€”Superficial nerves of the antenur surlUee of the thigh. (Testut.) (/) The internal or long saphenous nerve (Figs. 674, 675, 680, 683, 684, 685, 686, 688, 690) accompanies the nerve to the vastus internus to the apex of Scarpa's triangle. Here it enters Hunter's canal, in which it descends in front of the fenioral artery. At the lower end of the canal it seeks the surface, by passing with the superticial branch of the anastomotica magna artery between the sartorius and gracilis, and piercing the deep fascia just below the knee. It then joins the long saphenous vein, distributes branches to the skin all down the 40

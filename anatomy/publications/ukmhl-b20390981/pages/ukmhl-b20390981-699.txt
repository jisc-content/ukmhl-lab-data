THE EAR. 671 located the structures which give the canal of the cochlea its peculiar intex'est. In the main these are especially nifiditied epithelial cells, to which the principal part of the nerve of hearing is distril)uted. The greater portion of these cells Fig. 719.—Organ of Corti. Diagrammatic view of a small portion. (Testut.) constitute the organ of Corti (Fig. 719), and the parts of this around which the other elements are grouped are the rods of Corti. They are called inner rods and outer rods, according as they are nearer to or farther from the acute angle of the Fig. 7ju.—Distribution of the auditory nerve. Semidiagrammatic. (Testut.) tube. The bases of these cells are broad, and .securely f:i.stened to the basilar membrane; their shafts are slender, and their upper ends enlarged, that of the inner suggesting the proximal extremity of the ulna, that of the outer looking considerably like the head of a swan. The rods of each set constitute a continu- ous row from end to end of the canal. The two sets incline toward each other

THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTE3L 452 the leg. It winds upward in the sul)stance of tlie tibialis anterior to the patella, and anastomoses with the arteries forming the patellar anastomosis. Muscular branches are given off to the muscles on the antei'ior surface of the leg. The malleolar arteries are small branches given off from the lower portion of the ante- rior tibial. The external malleolar supplies the tissues over the outer ankle, the internal malleolar those over the inner ankle. The Dorsalis Pedis (Fig. 489).—The dorsalis pedis is the continuation of the anterior til>ial. It begins at the bend of the ankle, and continues downward and forward to the base of the lirst interosseous space, where it divides into the dor- FiG. 488.—Horizontal section at middk' of riglit leg—upper surface of lower segment. (After Braune.) sails hallucis and the communicating or plantar digital branch. The vessel is superficial in position ; it is accompanied by the anterior tibial nei've and venae comites ; it is external to the tendon of the extensor proprins hallucis. Variations.—The dorsalis pedis varies in size greatly; when large, it assists materially the plantar arteries in supplying the sole of the foot; when small, the plantar arteries may furnish a large part of the supply for the dorsum. Surgical Anatomy.—The dorsalis pedis can be exjiosed by an incision along the outer side of the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis. It is accompanied by the anterior til>ial nerve and by vena3 comites. The Branches of the dorsalis pedis are the tarsal, metatarsal, dorsalis hallucis, and communicating or plantar digital. The tarsal artery winds outward over the

681 THE EYE. ball is not strictly a sphere, but is composed of segments of two unequal spheres, an anterior, smaller segment (of a smaller sphere), forming about one-sixth of the whole, superposed upon a posterior, larger segment (of a larger sphere), forming the remaining five-sixths. For descriptive purposes certain points and lines in relation to the eyeball must be defined. The anterior pole is the centre of the front surface of the cornea ; the posterior pole is the centre of the back surface of the sclerotic ; a straight, line joining these poles is the sagittal axis. The equator of the eyeball is a line around its surface equally distant at all points from the two poles ; its plane divides the globe into anterior and posterior hemispheres. The inner side of the eye is appropriately termed the nasal side; the outer, the temporal. To prevent misconception, it is necessary to say here that, even if its seg- mented formation be disregarded, the eyeball is still not a perfect s])here. The transverse diameter (about one inch) is the greatest, the antero-posterior slightly less, and the vertical the least. It may be added that, in an antero-posterior, vertical section of the eyeball, passing through the sagittal axis, the inner or nasal division will be slightly smaller than the outer or temporal. Anatomically considered, the eye may be regarded as a hollow sphere (Fig. 731), whose wall is composed of three tunics and whose cavity is filled by three refracting media. The three tunics are (1) an outer, _^6roMS tunic, consisting of Fig. 731.â€”The right eye in horizontal section, showing the upper surface of the lower segment. Dia- grammatic. (Testut.) sclerotic and cornea ; (2) a middle, rascnlar tunic, comprising choroid, ciliary zone, and iris ; (3) an inner, nervous tunic, the retina. The three refracting media are the aqueous humor in front, the vitreous humor behind, and the lens between the two others. Each of these will be considered in turn.

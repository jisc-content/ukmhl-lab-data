Tlui.s, we may speak of the mesen- tery of the gall-bladder, seen in cases where this reservoir, instead of being held close to the liver, as is usually the fiict, hangs away from it at some little distance, depending from a doul)le, serous fold, which encloses its vessels and nerves. The mesenteries of portions of the large intestine are called by specific names, as transverse mesocolon, sigmoid mesocolon ; and exce})tionally we find an (tscending mesocolon, or a descending mesocoh)i. The mesentery of the vermiform appendix is called the mesenteriolum (" the little mesentery"). The Mesentery proper extends from the left side of the second lumbar verte- bra obliquely downward to the right iliac fossa. The transverse mesocolon crosses the abdomen horizontally at the level of the third portion of the duodenum. The sigmoid mesocolon begins in the left iliac fossa, passes downward and to the right until it reaches the middle line of the sacrum, in which it then goes down- ward a short distance. The occasional ascending mesocolon lies behind the portion of intestine to which it belongs, and the same is true of the rare descending mesocolon.

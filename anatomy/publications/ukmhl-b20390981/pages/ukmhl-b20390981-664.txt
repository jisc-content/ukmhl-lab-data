THE 2^EB VES. 636 TELLAR BRANCH OF INTERNAL SAPHE- NOUS NERVE EXTERNAL POP- LITEAL NERVE MUSCULO-CUTA-, NEOUS NERVE .INTERNAL SAPHE NOUS NERVE ANTERIOR "tibial NERVE brancli supplies a twig to the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and occasionally sup- plies the interosseous muscles of the fourth space. The deep branch of the external plantar nerve continues to accomjiany the external plantar artery beneath the long flexor tendons. It supplies branches to all the interosseous muscles (except occasionally those of the fourth space), the outer three lumbricals, and the adductor obliquus and adductor transversus hal- lucis ; as well as articular filaments to the tarso-metatarsal and metatarso-phal- angeal joints. External Popliteal or Pero- neal Nerve (4. 5.1; 1. 2. s.). This nerve (Figs. 674, 679, 680, 681, 683, 686, 688) de- scends (il)liquely along the outer boundai'v of the pop- liteal space following closely the inner border of the biceps muscle and its tendon as far as the fibula, thus crossing the outer head of the gastrocne- mius. Beneath the head of the fibula it winds round the outer side of that bone, piercing the peroneus longns, and in its substance dividing into the musculocutaneous and anterior tibial nerves. Shortly after its formation it gives off, fre- quently by one common trunk, two external articular branches, which accompany the superior and inferior external articular arteries to the knee-joint. A recurrent articular branch is given off just before the nerve bifurcates. It passes under the peroneus longus and extensor longus digitorum to join the anterior tibial recurrent artery. Many of its fibres end in the upper end of the tibialis an- terior, but some pass to the superior tibio-fibular joint, the periosteum over the outer tu- berosity of the tibia and the knee joint. Of the two cutaneous branches (5. 1., 1. 2. s.) the ramus communicans jjeronei or fibular communicating branch joins the tibial, communicating below the middle of the leg to form the short saphenous nerve. Sometimes they do not join, and then this nerve usually ends on the heel or outer side of the foot. The lateral cutaneous branch of the pero- neal nerve supplies the skin along the outer side of the upper two thirds of the leg.

THE LARYNX. 775 glottis, tilt' (lownwai'd-sloping sides by the aryteiio-epiglottic folds of mucous membrane, wliieh run from the sides of the epiglottis to the tojis of the arytenoid cartilages, and are nodulated by the cuneiform and corniculate cartilages. Througli this wide aperture are seen in front the backward projection from the surface of tlie epiglottis called its cushion ; on the siiles, diverging backward and outward, the upper or false vocal cords ; farther down in the cavity and nearer the median line the true vocal cords, and, on a level with them, the inner margins of the bases of the arj'tenoid cartilages ; and finally, occupying the middle line and a little s])ace on each side of it, the rima glottidis. This chink of the glottis is about an inch in its fore-and-aft measurement, the front two-thirds of this being bounded laterally by the true vocal cords, the hind third by the arytenoid cartilages. The portion between the vocal cords is called the vocal ]mrt, from its function in the |)r<iduetion of voice ; the portion between the arytenoids is known as the respiratory part, on account of its use in the process of breathing.

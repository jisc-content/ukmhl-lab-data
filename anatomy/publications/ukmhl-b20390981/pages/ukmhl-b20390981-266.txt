Action : it draws the shoulder forward, as in pushing; the lower segment rotates the apex of the scapula upward. Ner'-c, the posterior thoracic. The lower five points of origin interlock with similar slips of the obliquus externus abdominis. Pectoralis Minor (Fig. 260, 270).—"The smaller breast-muscle." Situation, m the front of the chest.

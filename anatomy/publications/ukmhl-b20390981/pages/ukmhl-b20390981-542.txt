The adherent tissues Wine dissected away, it is seen to be of trianguhir shajie. with its apex above : and its base, which is its thickest part, is found to reach to the surface of the brain at the anterior perforated space, where it is uniteil to the lenticular nucleus.

The Amygdaloid Nucleus i Figs. 581, 586, 575). This ganglion, . r-Ki w ise called • ,. .^^ /'z/a. is a mass at the tip of the temiwral lobe, due to a thickening of the cortex of this region. It is of sufficient size to cause a protrusion into the rexif of the middle horn of the lateral ventricle, at whose distal end it receives the extremity of the surcingle. It is continuous in front and above with the lenticular nucleus. The Velum Interpositum. Although it is a part of the parietes of the third ventricle, the rehtm inter- posttttm interposed veil "» requires description here because its fringed edges, the choroid pfexust-s. appear in the floor of the lateral ventricles, and c:tnnot be understood except in connection with the velum. It ^Nnll be recalled (^Figs. 549, 552) that the pia of the nnder side of the developing first brain-vesicle is brought by the backwanl and downward gre>^vth of that segment directly in contact with the pia of the upper surtace of the second brain-vesicle. The combination of the two layers of pia constitutes the velum interpositum—^the veil placed between the prosencephalon and the thalamencephalon. It lies just beneath the part of the fornix which appears in the bodies of the lateral ventricles, and just above the cavity of the third ventricle, resting at the sides upon the upper surfaces of the thalami. In the floor of each lateral ventricle, between the fimbria, which makes the edge of the fornix, and the ttenia semicireularis. which margins the caudate nucleus, is a narrow strip of the parietes of the first encephalic vesicle in which there is an entire absence of nervous tissue, and. consequently, the wall of the vesicle in this area consists merely of endyma and pia. The fimbria and tcvnia are prolonged from the body of the lateral ventricle into its middle horn : and the wall Ijetween them here is like that between them in the body of the ventricle—merely pia and endyma in close contact, the nervous tissue which once existed in this narrow area having

503 THE CA VITY OF THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. is usually called the third ventricle, the first and second ventricles being the lateral, which are never designated in a numerical way, but always as right lateral ventricle and left lateral ventricle. It will now be seen that the third ventricle communicates with each lateral ventricle by a separate porta. Next we study the cavity of the third encephcdic vesicle—the mesencephalon. This assumes a shape as if it were stretched between its neighbor in front and the one behind : it is drawn out into a small tube, and thus constitutes a long and narrow channel from the vesicle before to that behind (Fig. 640). It is named the aqueduct (aqueductus Sylvii—from Sylvius, a celebrated anatomist), and also by another name, which will be better understood ^,„^^ ; a little later.

A little of the constriction between it and the fifth vesicle is still observable, even in the developed condition. The cavitv of the JiJ'th encephalic vesicle—the metencephalon—undergoes changes in its fore part almost identical with those ; -r-.^.-r. i experienced by that of the fourth; but the triangle \ ,:^^:rL~ 1 which it forms has its base forward, applied to the base of the triangle of the fourth vesicle, and its apex backward, and the obliquity of the surfaces is oppo- site to that of those of the fourth (Figs. 543, 544). Thus, the two vesicles form a single shallow cavity FOURTH VESICLE Fi'i- 541.—Diagram of changes Fig. 542.—Diagram of changes in fourth vesicle—view from left side, in fourth vesicle—view from above. of rhomboidal form, when viewed from above. The hind part of this fifth vesi- cle is drawn out into a tube, and is continuous with the cavity of the myelon. The combined cavities of the fourth and fifth vesicles form what is commonly known as the fourth ventricle. We note that this fourth ventricle is connected with the third ventricle by the aqueduct, the other name of which, promised

179 THE ETHMOID BONE. The external pterygoid plate, l)road and thin, lies in a plane directed back- ward. The internal surface alifbrds origin to the internal ])terygoid muscle, the external surface to the external pterygoid muscle. This plate forms the inner boundary of the zygomatic fossa, and the outer boundary of the jjterygoid fossa, Avhich lies between and behind the two jilates. The internal pterygoid plate, longer and narrower than the external, forms the outer boundary of the posterior naris, where it is partly covered by the sphenoidal process of the palate-bone. From the up]>er end of the internal surface on each side a thin plate, the vaginal process, projects inward to articulate with the ala of the vomer, and in front with the sphenoidal process of the palate, the latter converting a groove beneath the base of the vaginal process into the jAerygo-palatine caned. Posteriorly at the base of the internal plate is the small pterygoid tubercle, between which and the lingula is the Vi<1ian canal, and below which is the shallow scaphoid, fo.'isa, I in which the tensor palati muscle arises. The posterior border is prolonged below into the slender, Jianiular {" hook-like ") process, grooved externally above for the passage of the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. It is often to be felt behind and I within the last upper molar tooth. In front the two plates are joined above, and form a smooth triangular surface, which makes the back wall of the spheno-maxil- lary fossa, and presents superiorly the anterior orifice of the Vidian canal. Below, the two jilates are separated in front by the pterygoid, notch, which is occupied by the pyramidal process of the palate-bone. The cartilage of the Eustachian tube is attached and supjjorted along the hind, inner, and ujiper part (tf the internal plate. Articuhdions.—The sphenoid articulates with all the other bones of the cra- nium, which it binds firmly together, and with five of the facial bones—viz., two I malar, two palate, and the vomer, and sometimes one or both superior maxillae. Varieties.—The ligaments normally connecting the clinoid processes may become ossified. The fejramcn of J^esalius, for an emissary vein, is sometimes I present internal to the foramen ovale. Ossification occurs in cartilage from twelve centres in two divisions, a pre- and a post-sphenoid, which join at the olivary eminence, and are distinct in many animals. The sphenoidal sinuses begin to hollow out the body in the sixth year, before which they are confined to the sphenoidal turbinate bones, which develop separately in cartilage. THE ETHMOID BONE. CRIBRIFORM PLATE The ethmoid or .s?V?'e-io?ir (Figs. 199-201) is I'oughly cuboidal, and projects downward from the ethmoidal notch of the frontal bone between the orbits to form part of the orbits, nasal fossse, and base of the ci'a- nium. It is very light, being largely composed of. , cavities bounded by thin walls. It consists of a ver- tical and a horizontal plate, and of two lateral masses, the last suspended from the margins of the horizontal plate. The vertical plate forms the ujijjer third of the median (though often deflected) se])tum of the nose, and is grooved for the olfactory nerves. It projects into the cranial cavity above the horizontal plate as i the median triangular crista gedli (" crest of the cock "). 1 This is most prominent in front, and along its thin I posterior border it attaches the falx cerebri. In front I it divides into two lateral alse, which articulate with i the frontal, and usually complete the foramen caecum, j The vertical plate articulates in front with the nasal spine of the frontal and the crest of the nasal bones, below and in front with the triangular se]>tal cartilage, below and behind with the vomer, and behind with the crest of the sphenoid.

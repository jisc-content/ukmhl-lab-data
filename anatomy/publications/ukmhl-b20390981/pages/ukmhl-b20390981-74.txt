ELEMENTARY TISSUES. 70 Synovial niembraues are divided iuto the following groups : 1. Articular. 2. Vaginal. 3. Bursal. 1. Articular Synovial Membranes. These occur in those articulations of the bony skeleton wherein two surfaces move upon each other. The bones concerned in such a joint are covered on the surfaces, which enter into the composition of the articulation, with a crust of cartilage, whose free surface is very smooth and hard. The bones are held together by strong bands of white fibrous tissue—the ligaments—which encapsu- late the ex])anded ends of the bones, forming hollow cylinders, wliich bound the joint. The inner surface of a capsular ligament is covered with a synovial membrane, which is reflected from it a little way upon the margin of each of the cartilages. Thus, the synovial membrane is a short tube with its edges turned inward. The arrangement of the parts will be seen in Fig. 73. If, as sometimes occurs, a ligament or a tendon passes across or through the joint-cav- ity, the synovial membrane ensheaths it. (jc- casionally the membrane exhibits folds, which Fig. 73.-Diagram of articular synovial cross the cavity or hang iuto it like fringes, f:^iSZ\^k\T^f.^rof'^IZn^t '-^nd perhaps contain some adipose tissue.

These are so named from vagina, "a sheath," and are also known as synovial sheaths. They are found in situations where the tendons of muscles run over bones, to which they are bound down by strong, fibrous bands. The ])one in these cases is grooved, and the fibrous tissue bridges over the gutter, thus making a FIBROUS ROOF OF THE CHANNEL CAVITY OF SYNOVIAL SHEATH TENDON CAVITY OF SYNOVIAL SHEATH ^BONY BED CTF THE CHANNEL 2 Fir;. 74.—Diagram of a vaginal synovial membrane in cross-section.

The synovial membrane is arranged in the form of a tubular sheath, one portion lining the canal, the other investing the enclosed tendon, as will be seen in Figs. 74 and 75.

THE THORACIC NERVES. 619 THE THORACIC XERVES. The thoracic nerves differ from all tlie other spinal nerv'es in that they enter into the formation of no plexus; but each is distributed to a transverse segment of the trunk, corresponding to the vertebrfe from between whicli it emerges. Tlie first thoracic nerve sends a small branch to the interval between the first and second ribs, the main trunk, ascending in front of the first rib to join the brachial plexus. Its intercostal branch behaves like the others about to Ije descriljed, but with rare exceptions has no lateral cutaneoas branch. Tile upper six thoracic nerves run round the chest wall in the spaces between the verteliro-sternal ribs ; the remaining six pursue a transverse course through the aVxlominal wall wliere the ribs are deficient in front. A typical intercostal nerve (Fig. 668), after receiving two rami comraunicantes from the corresponding ganglion of the sympathetic, passes outward between the ANTERIOR CUTANEOUS Fig. 668—Plan of a typical intercostal nerve.

It enters the interval between the internal and external intercostal muscles, and runs in it till the external intercostal mu.scle becomes deficient in front. It then dips under the internal intercostal muscle, and, between it and the internal mam- mary artery and triangularis sterni, reaches the side of the sternum, where it pierces the chest wall to become cutaneous. The lovjer intercostals, from the seventh to the eleventh inclusive, enter the interval between the transver.-alis and internal oblique muscles, where the ribs are deficient in front. They run forward in the abdominal wall, enter the sheath of the rectus abdominis, and pierce that muscle near the middle line to supply the skin. Lateral Cutaneous Branch&f (Figs. 669, 670).—The first intercostal nerve has no lateral cutaneous branch.

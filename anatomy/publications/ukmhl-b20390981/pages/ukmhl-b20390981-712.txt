684 THE ORGANS OF THE SPECIAL SENSES. muscle to the sclerotic, the adhesion between them is very loose, a lympli-sjiace, as already stated, being left between them. The iris, attached only at its circum- ference, hangs vertically in the aqueous humor about yV i'^*^'^^ behind the cornea, its pupillary margin resting lightly against the lens. The choroid is pierced behind by the optic nerve. On its outer surface the ciliary nerves, about fifteen in number, and the two long posterior ciliary arteries, after piercing the sclerotic, run forward to the iris. The Choroid. The choroid is a dark brown structure, whose stroma consists of blood-vessels, held together by delicate connective tissue, containing pigmented cells. The stroma is limited on both surfaces by non-vascular membranes, the pigmented memhrana suprachoroidea on the outside, and the unpigmented vitreous lamina on the inside. The vessels of the stroma exhibit two well-marked layers, a super- ficial venous layer foi'med of the vasa vorticosa, and a deep, closely-packed, capil- lary layer, the chorio-capillaris. Between these layers the short ciliary arteries run forward, giving off as they go the vessels of the chorio-capillaris and terminating in tliose of the ciliary processes. The Ciliary Zone. The ciliary zone or eiliarij body differs from the choroid, not so much in the composition of its vascular stroma, as in the fact that it contains a deposit of muscle-tissue, the ciliary muscle (Fig. 733), and presents on its deep surface a Fig. 733.â€”Meridian section of tne eye m the region of the ciliary muscle.

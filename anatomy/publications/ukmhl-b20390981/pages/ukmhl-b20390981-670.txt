THE NERVES. 642 These connections will be better nnderstood by examining tlie plan drawn out in Fig. 691. There a represents a medullated nerve-fibre from a ventral nerve- root, passing by a white ramus communicans through the ganglion directly con- nected with that spinal nerve to a ganglion higher up, where it will form an arliorization round a nerve-cell, like e ; 6, a niedvdlated nerve-fibre forming an arlxtrization round a cell of the ganglion of its own segment; c, a fibre jjassing through the ganglion without interruption ant! leaving it by one of its efferent branches to a prevertebral plexus or directly to some viscus ; <}, a fibre passing through the ganglion to some lower ganglion, there to end round some nerve-cell, or jiass out through an efferent ramus ; c, a medullated nerve from a lower gan- glion, behaving as a. The dotted lines are non-mcdullated nerves. Tlie fibre, arises as the axis- cylinder process of a ganglion cell, and passes by a gray ramus c(»mmunicans along the sheath of the posterior nerve-root to the spinal meninges ; fj passes by the posterior division to supply sympathetic fibres to its area of distribution ; h enters the anterior division and is similarly distributed ; h joins the spinal recur- rent branch to supply the interior of the vertebral canal, and I passes for a little way along the gray ramus communicans, but leaves it to be distributed to the sides of the vertebrae and intercostal or lumbar vessels. Gray fibres to the pre- vertebral plexuses, vessels, or viscera, are represented by m, m ; and n, n are non- mcdullated fibres joining neigh- boring ganglia. In addition to these, sensory fibres from the ganglia of the posterior spinal nerve-roots pass through the sympathetic ganglia to vis- cera without interruption.

MIDDLE CERVICAL ,£ GANGLION In the neck there are only three ganglia (Fig. 692). The upper one, however, is an inch or more in length, and is fre- quently constricted at intervals. It is connected with the four ujjper cervical nerves and ap- pears to consist of four ganglia fused together. The second ganglion is small, but is connected with two nerves ; and the third ganglion, intermediate in size, is connected with the lower two ceiwieal nerves. These ganglia and their intervening cord lie in front of the trans- verse processes of the cervical vertebrae, being separated from them by the rectus capitis an- terior major above and longus colli below with the preverte- bral fascia. The common and internal cai'otid arteries and the carotid sheath lie in front of them, and the vagus nerve lies to the outer side.

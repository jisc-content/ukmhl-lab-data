THE LARGE INTESTINE. Til The mucous membrane is paler, somewhat firmei*, and much simpler than that of the small intestine : there are no connivent valves, no villi, no glands of Brun- ner, no patches of Peyer. But there are many so-called solitary glands, though they are less numerous than in the upper bowel; and the thickness of the mucosa is occupied by simple, tubular glands, lai'ger than those met with previously, and containing a much greater proportion of goblet cells. In- deed, in not infrequent cases, it is found that the majority of the epithelial cells are of this variety. THE C^CUM. The cfficura {ccecns, " blind") (Figs. 783, 785) is thus named because it is a pouch, a no- thoroughfare. Its blind end points downward, its open end upward, passing directly into the colon, of which this gut seems to be the begin- ning, justifying its old name, caput coli, " the head of the colon." The line of separation between them is at the level of the opening from the small intestine, on the left side and behind, about two and a half inches from the lower end. Here is the Ueo-ccecal or ileo-coUc valve, which protects the ileum against the back- ward flow of faeces from the large intestine. If the extremity of the ileum was simply attached to the margin of a circular hole of its own diameter in the side of the large intestine, there would be a frequent reflux from the latter, and the Fig. 783.—Cavity of the csecum, its front waU having been cut away. The ileo-ca'Cnl valve and the opening of'the appendix are shown.

But, at the junction of the two guts, the ileum is flattened from above downward, and the serous coat and the outer layer of the muscular coat are so shortened that the otljer tunics are thrust into the cavity of the large intestine, forming two lips, an upper and a lower, with;

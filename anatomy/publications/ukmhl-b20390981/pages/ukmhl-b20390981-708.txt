THE eyeball, which is the essential organ of the sense of sight, is a somewhat spherical body, occupying the cavity of the orbit, where it lies embedded in a mass of fat and loose connective tissue. From the j^osterior two-thirds of the surface of the eye this bed is walled oil' by a membrane known as the capsule of Tenon (Fig. 730) between which and the globe of the eye there is a lymph-space Fig. 7S0.â€”The right eye in sagittal section, showing the capsule of Tenon.

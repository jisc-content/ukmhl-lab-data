641 THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES. the visceral branches of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves may be classed in the same category, though most of these join the subsidiary plexuses and not the gangliated cords.

The non-meduUatcd nerves commence as axis-cylinder processes of the gan- glion cells. Some are distributed in gray rami communicantes to spinal nerves, and in them reach the vessels, fascite, bones, etc., for which they are destined \ ACCOMPANYING DORSAL ROOT TO DURA ^DORSAL SPINAL NERVE ROOT SOMATIC VASOMOTOR, PILOMOTOR, SECRETORY k ,.iC'*__ TO VERTESR/E LIGAMENTS, %^ HECURREKL=^^^fc' SPINAL VESSELS & DUJiA TO HIGHER GANGLIA iSYMPATHETIC TRUNK RAMI EFFERENTES SYMPATHETIC GANGLION FROM RAMUS COMMUN.

A variable portion of the fourth lumbar nerve joins the fifth liunbar to f irm the lumbo-sacral cord. This trunk crosses the brim of the pelvis, j)ierces the pelvic fascia, and under cover of this foscia joins the sacral nerves on the ventral FOURTH LUMBAR GREAT SCIATIC Fig. 676.â€”Plan of sacral plexus. surface of the pyrifoi-mis muscle. AVith the first and second and greater part of the third sacral nerves the lumbo-sacral cord forms a great compound nervous trunk called the great sciatic nerve. A small band from the second sacral unites with the remainder of the third sacral and \\\{\\ the fourth sacral nerves to firm the internal pudic nerve. Thus the two main or terminal trunks are formed ; but, in addition to these, numerous collateral branches are given off: the superior gluteal, the inferior gluteal, the small sciatic, the perforating cutaneous, and nerves to the pyriformis, obturator intcrnus, gemelli and quadratus feraoris. The In-anches of this plexus are divisible into a dorsal and a ventral set. In the diagram the dorsal set are shaded. They spring from the back of tlie plexus and supply the extensor aspect of the linil) ; the ventral set spring from the anterior surface of the plexus and supply the flexor muscles. COLLATERAL BRANCHES. Tlu' twigs to tJte pyi-iforhiis are derived from the first and second sacral nerves. The nerve to the quadratus fcmoris lies on the ventral surface of the plexus, its fibres springing from the lumbo-sacral cord and first sacral nerve. On the hip it is seen descending under the obturator intcrnus and gemelli to reach the ventral surfiice of the quadratus, distributing on its way branches to the inferior gemellus and hip-joint.

615 THE 3IUSCUL0-SPIRAL NERVE. anterior, branches to the inner and outer heads of the triceps and anconeus arise while the nerve is in the spiral groove, and important branches are contributed to the middle and inner heads of the triceps, while the parent nerve lies behind the brachial arterv. One of these last, called by Kraiise the ulnar collateral, accom- panies the ulnar nerve for some distance. The internal cutaneous branch (8. c.) arises within the axilla, and supplies a Fig. 664.â€”Musculo-spiral aud circumflex nerves of right side. (Testut.) strip of skin down the inner side of the arm, between the iutercosto-humeral and circumflex areas. The external cutaneous 'branches are two in number, the upper (6. c.) being the smaller. It pierces the deep fascia in the line of the intermu.scular septum, and supplies the skin over the lower and outer part of the biceps. The lon-er branch (6. 7. 8. c), becoming superficial a little below the last, descends behind the external condyle, and supplies the skin of the posterior radial region from elbow to wrist.

THE BLOOB-YASCULAE SYSTEJtf. 432 gives olf a spinal branch, ^hich furnishes branches to the spinal cor»^ and mem- branes and TO the lumbar vertebree. The abdominal branch passes either in front of or behind the quadratus lumborum muscle to the muscles of the abdominal walls, winds forward, and anastomoses witli tlie intercostal arteries and branches from the external iliac, which supply the walls of tlie abdomen. Variations of the lumlvir arteries are not common. Two or more of the arteries are at times found to arise bv a common trunk. Sirrgical Anatomy.—In the operations to expose the kidney by lumbar incision, the position of tlie lumbar arteries should be remembered. The Sacra Media (middle sacral) artery arises from the lower end of tlie abdominal aorta, passes down the middle line of the last lumbar vertebra and sacrum, and to the tip of the coccyx, where it terminates in the structure known as Luschka's gland. It anastomoses freely in front of the sacrum with the lateral sacral arteries, and gives some branches to the rectum. Variations.—The middle sacral is sometimes a brancb from a lumbar artery, sometimes from the common iliac. Surgical Anatomy.—In the operation known as Kraske's operation, where the lower portion of the sacrum is removed, this ariery is to be regarded. THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES (Figs. 470, 474V The common iliac arteries take their origin from the aorta where it bifurc-ates opposite tlie fourth lumbar vertebra.

The Relations of the common iliac arteries differ on the two sides, owing to the fact that the common iliac veins both pass to the ascending vena cava, which is to the riirht of the aorta.

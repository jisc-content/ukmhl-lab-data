EMBRYOLOGY. 80 number of distinctly granular cells. At first no cavity exists in the centre of the morula, but soon the outer cells become in large jiart forced away from the inner ones by the imbibition of a fluid supplied by the walls of the uterus, and what is SEG M E NTA- TION CAVITY. ZONA PELLUCIDA. ECTODERM. Fig. 89.—Sectional views of ovum, after sogmeiitatioii, (After van Beneden.) termed a segmentation cavitj/ is formed (Fig. 89, B). The morula is thus converted into a hollow vesicle, termed the blastodermic vesicle, whose wall is formed by a single layer of cells, except at one region, where what were the inner cells of the morula form a lenticular thickening (Fig. 90). Later, this thickening flattens out, its cells becoming arranged in two layei-s, the innermost of which is composed of thin flat- tened cells, and forms what is termed the endoderm layer, while the outer one, consisting of cylin- drical cells, is known as the ecto- derm. External to these two layers, again, is a third one of flattened cells, termed the covering cells, which is continuous with the wall of the vesicle, but which eventually disappears so as to expose the ectoderm cells upon the surface. Still later, the endoderm layer, increasing in size, extends outAvard in all directions, and the vesicle presents a ditferentiation into three regions. One Fig. 90.—Blastodermic vesicle.

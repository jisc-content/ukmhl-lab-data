THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 396 and deep fascia are divided, and the submaxillary gland is exposed and drawn upward. Beneath the suliraaxillary gland the digastric tendon is exposed,running upward in each direction to its anterior and posterior belly respectively. Above this tendon is seen the hypoglossal nerve; between the nerve and tendon the hyoglossus muscle is exposed. The fibres of this muscle are separated, and; running parallel with the nerve but beneath it, the lingual artery conies into view. The ranine artery may be ligated by dividing the mucous membrane of the lower surface of the tongue parallel with and external to the raphe. Branches of the lingual are the hyoid, dorsal lingual, sul)]ingual, and ranine. Tlie Jii/oid runs along the up2:»er border of the liyoid bone. The dormJ lingual runs upward to the mucous membrane of the dorsum of the tongfue, which it supplies. The sublingual supplies the sublingual gland. The ranine gives off branches to the muscles of the tongue, and runs in a toi'tuous course to its tip, being in the last part of its course superficial, covered only by the mucous mem- brane. The Facial Artery (Fig. 448).—Origin : from the anterior surface of the exter- nal carotid al)ove the hyoid bone. Course and termination : the vessel passes upward and forward to the inferior border of the lower jaw. In its course it is SUPRAORBITAU OCCIPITAL Fig. 448.—Superficial arteries of the head. (Testut.) covered l)y the submaxillary gland and partly surrounded l)y the gland, so that the vessel occupies a groove on its deep surface. The vessel winds over the body of the lower jaw in front of the masseter muscle, marking the bone in this ])osi- tion by a shallow groove. It then passes upward and forward on the face to the side of the nose, and from the side of the nose upward to the angle of the eye, where it terminates as the angular artery.

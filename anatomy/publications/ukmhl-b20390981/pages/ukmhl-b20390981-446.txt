THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTE3L 430 Surgical Anatomy.—The position of the mesenteric branches in the mesentery shonld be carefully noted in operations for the removal of sections of the intes- tines. Although the branches anastomose freely in the mesentery, when they reach the intestine and are distributed to it, they wind between its walls at right angles to its long axis, and do not anastomose freely with each other; and, as a result of this fact, a separation of the mesentery for any considerable extent from the intestine cuts off the blood supply of the gut, nnd gangrene results. The Branches of the superior mesenteric are the inferior pancreatico-duo- denalis, the intestinal and the colic arteries. The inferior pancrcatico-duodenalis runs between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, supplying those struct- ures, and anastomosing with the ]:)ancreatico-duodenalis superior. The intestinal branches supply all of the small intestines exccjit the duodenum. The colic branches are divided into the ileo-colic, the colica dextra or right colic, and the colica media or middle colic. The ileo-colic su])plies the caecum, the ileum adjoin- ing it, and the appendix. The rir/ht colic supplies the ascending colon ; the mid- dle colic, the transverse colon, and anastomoses with the left colic. Fig. 473.—Inferior mesenteric artery. (Testut.) The Inferior Mesenteric (Fig. 473).—The inferior mesenteric arises about an inch and a half above the termination of the aorta. It passes between the layers of the meso-colon and supplies the left portion of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. Variations.—The inferior mesenteric is occasionally absent, its place being supplied by branches from the superior mesenteric.

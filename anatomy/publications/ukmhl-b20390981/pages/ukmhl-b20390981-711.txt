683 THE EYE. by the breaking up of the membrane of Descemet, contains a numljer of minute spaces, the, spaces of Fontanel, which communicate with the aqueous chamber on the one hand, and, on the other, with a minute venous sinus contained in a canal in the sclerotic, which encircles the margin of the cornea. This is the canal of JSchlemm. The subsfeintiei propria of the cornea is composed of many su])erposcd layers of connective tissue, tlie fibres of contiguous layers having ditferent directions, and all being insejiaraljly held together, as in the sclerotic, by many interclianges of fibres. Between the layers, and even between the bundles and fibrils of which they are composed, there is an interstitial cement substance, in which are found lymph-spaces, occupied, but not filled, by the corneal corpuscles, and all directly or indirectly communicating so as to provide for a very complete lymph-vascular circulation. Unlike the sclerotic, tlie cornea is richly supplied with nerves, which are derived from the ciliary. They first form a ])lexus around its margin; then, losing their medullary sheath, they form another plexus in the laminated struct- ure ; from this bi'anches proceed to form a third plexus on the corneal surface beneath the conjunctival epithelium ; finally, fibrils pass in among the epithelial cells, and reach their terminal distribution almost at the free surface of the con- junctiva. THE MIDDLE OR VASCULAR TUNIC. In the vascular tunic, or uveal tract, of the eye (Fig. 732) three parts may be distinguished : the choroid behind, the iris in front, and the ciliary zone, or body, ¥ORTICOSA POSTERIOR CILIARY ARTERY CILIARY ARTERIES Fig. 732.—Vessels and nerves of the choroid and iris, seen from above.

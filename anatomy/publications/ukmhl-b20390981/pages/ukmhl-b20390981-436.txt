THB BLOOD-VASCULAB SYSTEM. 420 anastomose with the profunda aneries and the ana?tomotica magna of the brachial: the main portion of the posterior interosseous passes downward to the wrist l>etween the superficial and deep layers of muscles of the forearm. In the wrist the ulnar gives ofi" anterior and po<ferior carpal branches : these branches anastomose with similar branches of the radial and supplv the carpus; tlie posterior carpal of the ulnar with the posterior carpal branch of the radial form on the back of the carpus the posterior carpal arch, which sends branches to the interosseous spaces and the fingers. In the hand the ulnar divides into the deep palniar and tlie superficial palmar, which latter forms with the superficialis vol* of the radial, the superficial palmar arch (Fig. 4641. deep pa/jjior branch passes between the flexor brevis and the abductor minimi digiti to reach the radial, which it assists in forming the deep Fi'5. ir-i.â€”Sup-erScial palmar arcli and its branehe;.

The branches of the arch are the jour digital arteries, of which the inner one sup- plies the iimer side of the little finger, the second the contiguous sides of the little and ring fingers, the third the contiguous sides of the ring and middle fingers, and

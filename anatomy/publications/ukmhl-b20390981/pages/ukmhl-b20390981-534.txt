THE CEBEBBO-SPIXAL AXIS. 518 line of the cerebrum all of these fibres are compressed vertically and, to a less degree, antero-posteriorly into a solid mass. Consequently the fibres seem to radiate from each side of this condensed body—going out, up, down, forward, backward—to terminate in the gray matter at the perijihery of the hemisphere (Figs. 566, 567). The mass (with a slight addition, presently to be described) is the corpus cdUosum (" the hard body "), called, also, merely eallosuia. The middle of it can be seen by drawing the upper portions of the hemispheres ajiart, so as to widen the great longitudinal fissure, and looking directly downward into this enlarged cleft Fig. 566.—Diagram of coronal sec- tion of cerebrum to show course of fibres of callosum.

It presents a free surface on top, in front, and l)ehind ; but its shape and size are not appreciated until sections of the cerebrum are made in various directions. A vertical median divi.sion of the cerebrum shows a cut surface of the callosum, which reveals its form and extent from before backward (Fig. 568). It is seen to be a long, thick, irregularly flattened arch. Its front end is curled back underneath, and is called the f/enu (" knee"). This thins out rapidly to an edge, the rostnviii ("beak"), which is connected with the front part of the wall of the third ventricle by a delicate plate, the basal irhitr coiiimissurc, or cojiula. The hind end, also, is rounded, its lower part being folded sharply forward, and is named the splenimn ("bandage"). The portion between the genu and splenium is the body. If the cerebral tissues which ovei'lie the callosum at the sides are cut away, it is found to be depressed along the middle line, and to

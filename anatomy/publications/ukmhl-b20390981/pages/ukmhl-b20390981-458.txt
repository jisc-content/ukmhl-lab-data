THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 442 circular amputations of the tliigli. The femoral can be ligated at anv part of its course. To ligate the common fenjoral make an incision in a line which bisects Scarpa's triangle, passing from the middle of the base to the apex. Beginning at the inguinal (Poupart's) ligament and passing downward three inches, divide skin, su])ertieial and deep fascia. The common femoral will be exposed, with the vein situated internally and in close contact, and with the anterior crural nerve exter- nally, and separated from it by a distance of a half inch. The femoral can be ligated at the apex of Scarpa's triangle by an incision along the inner border of the sartorius muscle in this position.

The femoral can be ligated in Hunter's canal by an incision along the outer Ijorder of the sartorius in this position ; the sartorius is drawn inward, the tibrous covering of the canal divided, and the artery exposed, with the vein behind or external, and the internal sa])henous nerve superficial and external.

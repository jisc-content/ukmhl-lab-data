THE SUrERIOIi MAXILLARY BONE. 181 THE BONES OF THE FACE. THE MAXILLA, OR SUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The maxilla or upper jaw-bone (Figs. 202-204) forms the largest part of the facial skeleton, including part of the floor and outer wall of the nasal fossa, the roof of the mouth, and the Hoor of the orbits, and in it are lodged the upper teeth. It comprises a central hollow body and four processes. Its shape is characteristic of man and of his food and the mode of employing it. Surgically, it is important from its many diseases. The Body.—The facial snrj'ave looks forward and outward, and presents a prominent ridge, due to the fang of the canine tooth, which separates two shallow depressions, the incisive fossa in front and the canine fossa behind. Above the Fig. 202.—The right maxilla, outer surface. (Te.stut.) latter and just below the orbital margin is the infraorbital foramen, where the infraorbital nerve and artery emerge. The inner margin presents the deep nasal notch, attaching the soft parts of the nose. The lower edge of the notch is pro- longed forward internally into the anterior nasal spine. The convex posterior or a 0) Fig. 203.—The right maxilla, inner surface. (Testut.) '.ygomatic surface is separated from the facial surface by a ridge ascending from :he socket of the first molar tooth to the malar process. This surface forms the mterior boundary of the zygomatic fossa, and above and internally it bounds the ^pheno-maxillary fossa in front. Near its centre are the ajjertures of the two or nore posterior dental canals for nerves and vessels of that name. The prominent

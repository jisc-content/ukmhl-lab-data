It passes down the fibular side of the leg close to the fibula, either lying on or contained in the fibres of the flexor longus hallucis muscle. At the lower border of the interosseous membrane it gives off an anterior peroneal branch, which runs forward to the anterior and outer surfaces of the ankle. The rest of the vessel is continued dowuAvard, to the posterior surface of the outer ankle and the os calcis. In its course the peroneal gives oft' muscular branches to the contiguous muscles, a nutrient branch to the fibula, a communicatinf/ branch to anastomose back of the ankle with the communicating branch from the posterior tibial. The vessel is accompanied by venag comites, but not by a nerve-trunk. Variations (see posterior tibial artery). Surgical Anatomy (Fig. 484).—The peroneal is ligated in amputations of the Fig. 484.—Surgical relations of the peroneal artery. (Kocher.) leg. The ]-)Osition of the vessel on the fibular side of the leg between the deep and superficial muscles, or in the substance of the flexor longus hallucis, should be noted. The peroneal artery can be ligated in the middle portion of its course through an incision a finger's breadth behind and parallel to the fibula. The

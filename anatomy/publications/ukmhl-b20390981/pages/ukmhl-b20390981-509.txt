NODES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 493 The pectoral nodes drain the greater part of the mammary gland, the integu- ments of the side and front of the chest, and those of the abdomen above the level of the navel. The subscapular nodes receive lymph from the superficies of the back of the neck, the shoulder, and most of the trunk a])ove the crest of the ilium. The subclavian nodes derive their lymph from the skin of the deltoid region and the outer aspect of the arm. They connect with the deep cervical.

H. G.) The Epicondylar Node, situated above the internal condyle of the humerus, gets its lymph from the inner portion of the surface of the hand and forearm, and its efferents carry it to the proper axillary nodes. THE NODES OF THE LOWER LIMB and their Tributary Vessels. The nodes of the lower limb (Figs. 522, 523) are the superficial and deep inguinal, the popliteal, and the gluteal. The Superfcial Inguinal Nodes are arranged in two series—a superior or oblique, and an inferior or vertical. The supjerior set is situated close to the inguinal ligament, and is subdivided into three groups—the external, the middle, and the internal—each comprising about three nodes. Their lymph comes from the integuments of the buttock and the skin around the anus, the lower and outer part of the back above the buttock, the belly below the level of the navel, and the penis (Fig. 524); also from the distal portion of the ui'ethra in both sexes, and from the vulva and the lower third of the vagina in the female.

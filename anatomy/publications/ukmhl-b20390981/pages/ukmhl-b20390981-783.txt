755 THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. By F. H. GERRISH. PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY. RESPIRATION is a dual function, consisting of the simultaneous expulsion of certain waste matters and appropriation of a nourishing material. The substance which is introduced in this process is gaseous, and the thing:s which are eliminated are either gaseous or vaporized. The double performance is popu- larly called breathing. The apparatus necessary for respiration consists of a thin, moist membrane, exposed on one side to air, and on the other to a moving stream of blood (Fig. 813). Each of these fluids gains sometliing from, and loses something to, the AIR THIN MUCOSA | - | - | - |_|— |_ |_ | ~ CAPILLARY BLOOD VESSEL (3I)QQ Q(3(DQ(5 Q (330 ©(30 QQQO ©<S0" Fig. 813—Diagram of the essentials of a respiratory apparatus.

In^different classes of animals the necessary structural conditions are_ afforded in various ways. In some aquatic creatures the respiratory membrane is spread over the surface of a plume-like organ that projects from the body and waves about in the water, which always contains air (Fig. 814). A more common device is that of gills, in which the mucous mem- brane is disposed in layers, between which the air-laden water is drawn, being taken in at the mouth and ejected at the sides of the head. In the tadpole, which lives en- tirely in the water, the l)reathing organs are gills ; but the frog, into which tlie tadpole develops, has a very dilferent apparatus.

It is a sac, wholly contained in the trunk, and into it, at brief intervals, a quantitv of air is drawn, permitted to remain a short time, and then expelled by the channel of entrance. This sac is lined with a delicate

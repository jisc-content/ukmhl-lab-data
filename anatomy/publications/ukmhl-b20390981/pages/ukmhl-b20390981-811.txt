The papillaj project into it, and it encloses the divisions of the renal vessels, the Ijeginiiings of the excretory apparatus, lymphatic vessels and nodes, nerves, and a quantity of adipose tissue, which fills the spaces left unoccupied by these structures, and affords an elastic bed upon which they rest. The outer tunic extends into the sinus through the hilum, becomes continuous with the sheaths of the vessels, and is reflected onto the calices. The kidney is about 4| inches long, 2] inches vide, and 1} inch thick. It toeifjhs from 4 to 4^ ounces. Its surface is smooth, no traces of the foetal separa- tion of the lobes remaining. It is of a reddish-brown color. It has a firmer consistence than either liver or spleen, but is lacerated by moderate force. The artery of the kidney is the renal, and is large relatively to the size of the organ it sup])lies (Fig. 851). It divides into four branches, which pass into the sinus, and then break up into vessels, which enter the columns of Bertin, and pursue a course, which has already been described. The surface of the kid- ney receives small branches from the suprarenal, spermatic, and limibar arteries. The veins course side by side with the arteries.

The renal nerves come from the renal plexus and small splanchnic. They accompany the arteries, but have not been traced beyond the interlobular. Some fibres from the

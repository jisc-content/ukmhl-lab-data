THE ANKLE-JOINT. 239 4. The Ankle-joint (Figs. 256, 257). Tlie ankle is a hinge-joint, in which the articular surfaces of the lower end and internal malleolus of the tibia and of the external malleolus of the fibula form a mortice, into which the upper and lateral facets of the astragalus fit as a tenon. The transverse ligament helps to complete the tiljio-fibular socket behind. The capsule, strengthened and protected by the strong tendons passing over it, is divided, for description, into the following ligaments : The internal lateral or deltoid Uc/atnent is a strong, flat, triangular band m IucIi radiates from the lower and ventral borders of the internal nuilleolus downward and backward to the rough inner surface of the astragalus, downward to the sustentacu- lum tali of the os calcis, and downward and forward to the navicular and the margin of the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. A so-called deej) portion descends from the notch on the lower border of the malleolus to the depression on the inner surface of the astragalus. The external lateral ligament presents three separate diverging bands : 1. The Fig. 257.—Tibio-tarsal artic\ilation, outer side. The cavity is artificially distended.

581 THE FIFTH OR TRIFACIAL NERVE. otliers, and is formed by the third segment of the sensory root with the entire motor root, the two leaving the cranium through the foramen ovale, and uniting almost immediately afterward to form a single mixed nerve-trunk. About one- fourth of an inch below the base of the skull this short trunk divides under cover of the external pterygoid muscle into a smaller or anterior, and a larger or posterior, division. Befoi'e it divides, the trunk gives off a recurrent nerve, and the nerve to the internal pterygoid. The recurrent branch enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum, and sends a twig to the lining membrane of the mastoid cells, and another to the sub- stance of the petrous bone. The nerve to the internal pterygoid passes under the posterior border of that muscle supplying it on its deep surface. Near the origin of the nerve and lying on it is the otic ganglion, to which it contributes its sensory root. The smaller or anterior division of the mandibular trunk is mainly motor in function. Its branches are as follow : (rt) The deep temporal nerves, anterior and posterior. Of these the posterior frequently springs from one common trunk with the masseteric nerve. They run upward over the upper border of the external pterygoid muscle and between the tem])oral muscle and the bone, supplying the latter"muscle on its deep surface. (b) The masseteric nerve, frequently starting in common with the posterior deep temporal nerve, passes over the upper border of the external pterygoid, and through the sigmoid notch of the mandible behind the insertion of the tem- poral muscle, accompanied by the masseteric vessels. It enters the deep surface of the masseter muscle. It supplies a filament to the temporomaxillary articula- tion.

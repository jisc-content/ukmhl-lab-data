MUSCLE CIRCULAR MUSCLE a little forward, curving with the concavity in front. It is about one inch and a half long, and its lumen is about a quarter inch across. It is situated directly in front of, and is closely associated with, the lower part of the anterior wall of the vagina, through which it can be easily felt. Its external orifice is the narrowest part, and is located between the clitoris and the opening of the vagina. The front and rear surfoces of the tube are in contact. The lining is a pale mucous meml)rane, and it is gathered into small, longi- tudinal folds (Fig. 858). Its epithelium is flattened and stratified, excejit at the uppermost part, where it is transi- tional ; its corium is beset with small papilla?, which are most nu- merous near the lower end. Mu- cous glands are abundant. The subnuicous coat is areolar, and contains an unusual proportion of yellow fibrous tissue. Outside of this is the muscular tunic in two layers, an internal longitudinal, and an external circular. At the vesical end of the tube the circular fasciculi are particularly numer- ous, and form a ring, which is erroneously called the sphincter of the bladder, but is properly named the internal sphhicter of the urethra. Between the muscular layers are scattered many elastic fibres. In both layers, and es- pecially in the longitudinal, is a great quantity of blood-vessels, the veins being far more conspicuous by their number and size, and in their arrangement highly suggestive of erectile tissue, Fig. 8.58.

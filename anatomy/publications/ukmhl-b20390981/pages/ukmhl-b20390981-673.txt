645 THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES. side of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, between it and the diaphragm, and from it the cord descends into the abdomen through the crus <jf the diaphragm to unite the last thoracic to the first lumbar ganglion. Rami Communicanfes.—Two rami communicantes, sometimes called the exter- nal branches, unite each ganglion to its corresponding spinal nerve. Of these one is usually white, the other gray. 1 RENAL PLEXUS Fig. 693.—Plan of right sympathetic cord and splanchnic nerves. (Testut.) The rami ejferentes, called the internal branches, are divisible into an upper and a lower series. The icpper series proceeds from the upper four or five ganglia to the aorta, forming with branches from the splanchnic the thoracic aortic plexus. Other slender filaments supply the vertebrae and ligaments, and the second, third, and fourth ganglia send branches to the posterior pulmonary plexus. The lotoer series includes the internal branches of the lower six or seven ganglia. They form the great, small, and least splanchnic nerves. The great splanchnic (visceral) nerve is formed by the convergence on the sides of the vertebrae of the internal branches of the fifth or sixth to the ninth or tenth ganglia inclusive. These branches and the resulting trunk distribute fila-

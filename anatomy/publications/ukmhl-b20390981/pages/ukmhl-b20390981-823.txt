795 THE SPLEEN. are occupied by the spleen-pulp, which is substantially blooil, thickened Ijy tlu' addition of great numbers of leucocytes, among which are certain large cor- puscles, called splenic cells. The arrangement of the blood-vessels is extraordinary, and altogether jjeculiar to this organ. The splenic artery, whicli, judged by the standard of the arteries of other organs, is relativ-ely very large, runs in the lieno-renal ligament, and divides into five or six l)ranches before entering the organ. Rapidly breaking up into smaller vessels, when the minute arteriole stage is reached, which is generally succeeded by the stage of capillaries, the vessels abruptly terminate, and the blood is poured into the wall-less spaces of the spleen-]>ulp, from whicli it is collected by venules. The Malpighian corpuscles are factories for leucocytes, and the arterial blood courses among the latter, its flow being impeded by their great number and l)y the filamentous framework of the pulp-spaces. The blood in the splenic vein is remarkably rich in leucocytes. It is thought that one fimc- tion of the spleen is the disintegration of worn-out colored (iorpuscles of the blood, as the pulp contains many fragments of these cells. The li/inpliatics run in the tunica projiria, the trabecuhe, and the walls and sheaths of the vessels. They discharge into the splenic nodes, from which the lymph passes to the coeliac nodes. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The structure of the spleen is in some respects very similar to that of the lymph-nodes. The adenoid reticular tissue, the accumulations of lymph-cells, the great i-elative size in children, the atrophy which occurs in old ageâ€”all suggest an immense community of lymph-nodes, especially modified l)y a peculiar blood-supply. Not very infrequently accessori/ spleens (lienculi) are found. They are globular and small, but otherwise look like the principal spleen, near which they are situated.

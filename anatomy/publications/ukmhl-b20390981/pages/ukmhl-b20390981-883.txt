PLANE SECTIOm. 855 mated ; and, finally, it is almost impossible to carry the saw with absolute pre- cision through all parts of the plane intended. The subjects from Avhich these sections were taken were particularly muscular young men, and the appearances differ considerably from those observed in poorly developed or emaciatecl people. This is very marked in the case of the shoulders, whose high appearance is at least partly due to the very pronounced muscularity. In all of these drawings conventionalized shading is employed for the sake of clearness, and thus a somewhat diagrammatic etfect is produced. But the pose is to show relations, and not composition. The serous and synovial (virtual) cavities are represented by heavy black lines. Only by some such exaggerated method can they be made distinct in plane sections. Vessels and other tubes, when cut obliquely, present peculiar outlines ; and these are more marked the more nearly the section is in. line with the long axis of the cylinder. In the cut surfaces of many muscles will be seen tendons embedded in their substance. This fact is referred to in the general considerations concerning myology, but was purposely omitted from the description of the individual muscles. In some of the pictures which have substantially bilateral symmetry the parts are labelled on one side only. The important jKirts are, as a rule, labelled ; but in some cases this method was impracticable, and in these the legend will direct attention to the unlabelled objects.

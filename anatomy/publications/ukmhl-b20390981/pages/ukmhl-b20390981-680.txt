652 THE ORGANS OF THE SPECIAL SENSES. Examined on the snrface the skin varies ranch in textnre, being rongh and thick on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, even of the newborn child ; of medinm thickness on the scalp and dorsal surface of the trnnk, and thinnest on the ventral snrface of the trunk and inner sur- faces of the limbs. It is marked, throughout by furrows which differ in character. Over most of the body the furrows are like those on the back of the hand, shallow and intersecting each other so as to enclose angular areas, the bail's usually springing from intersecting points. On the palm and sole the furrows run in parallel lines, forming definite patterns (Fig. 696), which, while they correspond in the main, are peculiar to each individual, and never change throughout life in spite of the passage of the soft palm of babyhood into the horny hand of age and toil. Hence the value of the hand im- pression in wax as a means of identification. These ridges and gi'ooves are formed in the true skin on which the cuticle is accurately moulded. Deep and long grooves subtend the joints. The true skin blends with the loose subcutaneous tissue, and by its agency is made freely movable on the deep fascia. On the palms, soles, scalp, and pinna, however, the skin is closely bound to the deeper aponeurotic structures. The hairs and nails are modified epidermis, the sweat and sebaceous glands epi- thelial invaginations. The Epidermis (cuticle, scarfskin) is foi-med of stratified epithelium in many layers. It varies from to of an inch in thickness, being thickest on the palms and soles. It is roughly divisible into two strata, the Malpighian layer Fig. 696.â€”Arrangement of the papillary folds on the palmar surface of the distal segment of the thumb. (Testut.)

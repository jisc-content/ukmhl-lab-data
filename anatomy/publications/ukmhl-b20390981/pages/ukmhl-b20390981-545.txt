The bulging of the mesial wall corresponds to the depression in the cortex, which is named hippocampal fissure, and itself is called the Jilpjjocamjms ("sea-horse")—sometimes major {" the greater") being added. This peculiar elevation widens as it extends toward the apex of the horn, and terminates in a blunt indented end, called the pes hippocampi {" the foot of the hippocampus ") from its resemblance to the paw Fig. 582.—Semidiagrammatic coronal section through the middle horn of the right lateral ventricle. We look upon the hind surface of the front segment, and forward into the cavity. (F. H. G.) of some animal. The convexity of the tloor results from the bending inward of this part of the-parietes of the cavity caused by the collateral fissure, anterior to the part which causes the prominence in the floor of the posterior horn. Attached to the roof, which is made by the tapetuni, are the tail of the caudate nudeus and the tcenia semicircv.laris, side by side, as they were in the body of the ventricle from which they are traced, and ending in front in the amygdala.

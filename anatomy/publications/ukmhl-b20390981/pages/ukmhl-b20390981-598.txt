It is mixed in I'uuction. closely resembling a sjiinal nerve in that the motor and sensory roots arise se}x\r-atcly from the eneephalon. the sensory root [Xissessing a giuiglion similar in etmstitution and development to that of a posterior spinal nerve-root, while the motor root joins the nerve on the distal side of the ganglion. The uioiar root arises from a group of cells lying deeply in the floor of the fourth ventricle at a point corresponding to the lateritl ivcess. It is joined by the (h'sceuding root which appears to arise from cells in the aqtieduct and by a c/ tw<"</ motor root of doubtful connections. Most of the tibves of the sensory portion are traceable into the so-called a.-icemllng roof which appears as a crescentic baud of tibivs oiu>ide the gxdatiuous substance of Kolando. The libivs appear to arise as axis-i^ylinder processes of the cells of the Gasserian gtiuglion and to terminate as minutely bratiching pro- cesses round the cells of the gidatinous substance and funiculi gracilis and cuneatus (eompire sensory spinal nerve-ivotV Matiy sensory fibivs end in the superior stnson/ jiMc/t «,■>', which lies just outside the motor nucleus.

The Gasserian or Semilimar Ganglion.—This body lies on a special depression on the anterior surlace of the petivus bone; it is ereseent-sha|>ed, the ei^>nvexity being directtxl forwaiil. Its surfaces are adherent to the dura, flattened, and much striattxl; and it is rich in gtinglionie cells. It is joined by filaments f rom the carotid plex:us of the sympithetic, and semis recurrent fibres to the dura.

Its name, which means " straight," is Fig. 791.â€”Sagittal sectiim of the lnwer part of a male trunk, the right segment. (Testut.) made less absurd by the adoption of our present plan of delimitation of the intes- tines in this region, than it was when this segment was made to start at the sacro- iliac joint; for then it was crooked from every point of view, while now, wlien looked at from in front, it comes near deserving its title.

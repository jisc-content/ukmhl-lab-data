THE EXTERIOR OF THE SKULL. 193 vertically-placed structures : Mcsially are the podcrior narcfi, se])arated by the vomer, and bounded below by the horizontal plates of the palate-bones, laterally by the internal pterygoid plates, and above by the body of the sphenoid and the TCETH Fig. 221.â€”Base of the skull, viewed from below. (Testut.) alse of the vomer. On each side is seen the pteryc/oid fossa, conijileted by tlie tuberosity of the ])alate-bone below, and lodging the internal pterygoid and tensor palati mu.scles. The latter muscle arises from the scaphoid fossa, a subdivision at the upper part of the pterygoid fossa. External to the pterygoid fossa is the zygomatic fossa, whose roof forms part of the base of the skull. The basilar process of the occipital bone and a small part of tlie body of the sphenoid occupy the median portion of the middle division, while latendly are the petrosals and a small portion of the gi'eat wings of the sj)henoid, of the squamosals, and of the occipital bone. In the median line we notice the pjliaryn- f/eal tubercle and the front margin of the foramen tnagnum, termed the hasion. Laterally, in a nearly sagittal line, we notice from before backward the foramen ovale, the foramen spinosum, the opening of the bony and the groove for the cartilaginous Eustachian canal, the entrance of the carotid canal, and the jugular fossa and foramen. Internal to the latter is the anterior condylar foramen, and externally the stylo-niastoid, foramen. Between the extremities of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and of the basilar process of the occipital and the sphenoid we notice the foramen lacerum medium, filled by fibro-cartilage in 13

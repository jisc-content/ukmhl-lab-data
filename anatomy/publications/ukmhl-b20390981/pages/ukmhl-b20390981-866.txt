838 THE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The Mons Veneris. The mons Veneris is an elevation situated in front of the upper part of the pubic symphysis. Anteriorly and above, it merges into the integument covering the lower part of the abdomen, posteriorly it is continuous with tlie labia majora, laterally it is limited by the right and left inguinal folds. In structure the mons consists of modified skin, deeply pigmented, and covered with hair, beneath which is a collection of areolar and adipose tissue, intersected by a serie^s of MONS VENERIS Fig. 899.â€”Vulva of a virgin. Tlie labia liave been widely separated. (Testut.) elastic laminje. The latter take origin deeply from the linea alba and abdominal aponeurosis, and end by becoming attached to the deep surface of the skin. The Labia Majora. The labia majora ("greater lips"), two longitudinal folds of modified integu- ment, are continuous with the mons Veneris in front, and extend to within an inch of the anus behind. Each fold is about three inches in length, and presents for description two extremities, two surfaces, and two borders. The anterior extremities by their junction with the mons and with each other make up the anterior commissure; the posterior, having become very thin, are united by the posterior commissure or fourchetfe {" fork "), which constitutes the thin, anterior edge of the perineum. The outer surface, separated from the corresponding thigh by the genito-crural fold, is deeply ]iigmented, covered with hair, and abundantly supplied with sudoriparous and sebaceous glands ; the iimer is in con- tact, when closed, in part with its fellow, in part with the labium minus of the same side. The skin, which lines this surface in the vicinity of the free border, resembles that on the outer surface; more deeply it is rosy, moist, studded with

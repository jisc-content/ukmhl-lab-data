568 THE NERVES. PALATINE Fig. 629.â€”Outer wall of nose, showing olfactory nerves and nerves of common sensation. (Testut.) The Second or Optic Nerve. Traced backward from the eyeball the optic (" seeing ") nerves (Fig. 630) are seen to meet on the under surface of the brain in the optic commissure or chiasma, where they partially decussate, and whence two flattened bands, the optic tracts, pass backward round the crura cerebri to the thalami and quadrigeminal bodies. The optic tract (Fig. 630) arises by two roots from the pulvinar of the optic thalamus, the corpora geniculata, and the superior quadrigeminal body. Thence it bends round the iip])er end of the crus cerebri to which it is attached as a flat- tened, white band, and becoming more rounded, passes between the anterior per- forated space and the interpeduncular space to end in the chiasma. The optic commissure or chiasma (" like X ") is oblong, the longest diameter being transverse. It rests on a groove aliove the olivary eminence of the sphe- noid and has the internal carotid artery on either side of it. From its extrem- ities in front spring the optic nerves. The optic nerve enters the oi'bit by the optic foramen, accom])anied by the ophthalmic artery, which lies below and external to it. In the orbit it runs forward, outward, and a little downward to the back of the eyeball,

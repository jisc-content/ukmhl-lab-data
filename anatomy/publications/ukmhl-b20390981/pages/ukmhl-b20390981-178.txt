THE BONES. 172 It forms part of the temporal fossa, and is delimited from the mastoid surface behind by the curved mpramadoid crest. This crest is continued forward, just above the external auditory meatus, to the zygoma ("yoke"), a process of bone which projects, shelf-like, from the lower part of this surface outward, and then, twisted on itself, continues forward. In its forward projection the smooth inner surface and loAver border give origin to the masseter, the sharp upper border attaches the temporal fascia, and the serrated and bevelled anterior extremity articulates with the malar. Two ridges, or roots, extend from its base, the ])0S- terior backward and the anterior inward, enclosing between them a transversely oval, smooth depression, the glenoid fossa, divided into two parts by the nearly Fig. 193.â€”The right temporal bnne, viewed from tlie mesial plane.

For articulation with the lower jaw the front half ] of the fossa is coated with cartilage, together with the convex nearly transverse 1 ridge, the emimntia articularis, wliich limits it in front and forms the anterior root of the zygoma. At the outer end of the latter root is a tubercle (pregleuoid)'

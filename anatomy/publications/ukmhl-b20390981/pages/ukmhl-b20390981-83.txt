79 THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. It would seem from these plienomeua that the essential feature of fertilization is the union of the nuclei of two cells, the small amount of protoplasm present in the head of the spermatozoon seeming to play little part in the process. Since both paternal and maternal characteristics may be inherited, it has been supposed DEE Fig. 87.—Diagram illustrating the plieiiomena of maturation. (Testut.) that the nuclei must be the material bearers of hei'edity; and, since the charac- teristic substance of a nucleus is the chromatin, this has been regarded l)y many authors as the actual substance concerned in transmitting inherited peculiarities from the parent to the offspring. The Early Stages of Development. By segmentation is meant the conversion of the unicellular ovum into a mass of cells, a process which results from a series of divisions. The ovum first divides (Fig. 88) into two cells (a), each of these again dividing, so that four cells are Fig. 88.—Segmentation of the ovum. (After van Beneden.) formed (6), and, the divisions continuing (c, (T), a solid ma.ss of cells, termed a morula, is produced (e). A section through such a mass (Fig. 89, ^1) will show that it is composed of an outer layer of somewhat flattened cells enclosing a

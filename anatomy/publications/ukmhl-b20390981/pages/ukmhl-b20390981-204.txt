198 THE BONES. and backward on the gi-eat wing of the sphenoid, tlie squamous portion of tlie temporal, and the parietal bone. The posterior fomi, the deejjest and largest, lodges the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and pons, and is formed by the occipital bone, the petrous and mastoid portions of the temporal, the postero-inferior angle of the parietal, and the body of the sphenoid. Its anterior limits are the posterior limits of the middle fossa, and its posterior limits the grooves for the lateral sinuses, whose limiting ridges Fig. 225.â€”Base of the cranium, inner surface. (Testut.) attach the tentorium cerebelli. Tlie foramen, mergnani occupies the centre, and external to it from within outward are seen the anterior condylar foramen, the jugular foramen, and the internal auditory meatus. Behind the jugular foramen is the opening of the posterior condylar foramen when present, and more exter- nally, in the sigmoid sulcus, is the more constant mastoid foramen. The grooves for the lateral sinuses pass outward from the internal occijjital protuberance, usually cross the })osterior inferior angle of the jiarietal bone, and thence bend sinuously down and in on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and onto the occipital l)one, where they curve forward and end at the ])osterior division of the jugular foramina. The grooves for the inferior petrosal sinuses lie along the suture between the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the occipital, and end in the anterior division of the jugular foramina. The jugular foramen (foramen lacerum posterius) is usually unsymraetrical and of a somewhat pyriform shape. It is often divided into three com[)artments by two more or less marked con-

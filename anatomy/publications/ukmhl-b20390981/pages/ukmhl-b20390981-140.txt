THE BONES. 136 twisted inward in descending. It presents external, internal, and dorsal surfaces separated by external, internal, and ventral borders. The external and internal borders, slightly marked above, become jirominent below as the external and internal supracondylar ridges, which descend to the condyles. From each of Fig. 159.—The right humerus, front view. (Testut.) Fig. 160.—The right humerus, rear view. (Testut.) these an intermnscular septum arises, and from the upper two-thirds of the external ridg'. arises the brachio-radialis muscle, and from its lower third the extensor carpi radialis longus. The external border extends down from the back of the great tul T.jsity, and Is int3rrupted near the middle of the shaft by the musculo-spiral groove. Th ■ internal border commences above just below the head,* and near its centre presents a rough impression, extending on to the adja- cent inner surface, for the lorac o-brachialis muscle. The ventral border starts above from the front of the grec.t tuberosity as the outer lip of the bicipital groove, and ends below in the riuge separating the trochlea and capitellum. The internal surface in its upper third presents the vertical bicipital groove, which lodges the long tendon of the biceps. Its two rough lips give insertion, the outer to the pectoralis major, the inner to the teres major below, and to the latissimus dorsi above, which is also attached to the floor of the groove. A little below the centre is seen the nutrient foramen, directed downward. The external surface pre- ' It is usually described as coutinuing the inner lip of the bicipital groove.

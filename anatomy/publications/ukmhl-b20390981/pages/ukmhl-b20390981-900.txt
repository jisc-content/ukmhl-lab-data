RELATIONAL ANATOMY. 870 Fig. 939. (Extru-seriul.)â€”The relations of the principal fissures and of the lower borders of the cerebral liemisphere to the surface of the skull. The fissures and borders are not labelled, as the Sylvian, central, and parieto-occipital fissures cannot be mistaken. The inferior line does not show the lowest level reached by the temporal and occipital lobes, but the lowest parts of them that come close to the skull.

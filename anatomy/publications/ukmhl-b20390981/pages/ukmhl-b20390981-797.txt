THE LARYNX. 769 CORPUS TRITICEUM LATERAL THYRO- HYOID LIGAMENT two in number, are located upon the upper and Iiack part of the cricoid, and are irregularly pyramidal in shape. UjJon the summit of each is a comicidum laryngis (" little horn of the lar- ynx"), somewhat cone-shaped, and bent backward and downward. (The cuneiform cartilages will be mentioned later.) The epiglottic cartilage (Fig. 832), situated, as its name implies, upon (or over) the glottis, is shaped like an oval leaf, its stem Ijcing received in the notch between the two wings of the thyroid. Its hind surface is concave above, and is convex below this, the pi'ominence in the centre being called the cushion. The cricoid, the thyroid, and the arytenoids (except the ajjices of the last) are composed of pure cartilage ; the rest of the cartilages are of the yellow variety. The true cartilages are liable to ossify at any time after maturity is at- tained. At puberty the lary n x under- goes great changes of growth, which are especially marked in the male, and are prevented by castration. The position and relations of each of the cartilages are shown in Fig. 832. The Ligaments of the Larynx. The cartilages of the larynx are movably articulated \\\{\\ one another at various jjoints.

In all of these cases the movement is gliding, or rotary, or both, the car- tilages concerned in a joint ai"e united by a capsular ligament, and the artic- ulation has a true synovial membrane. In addition to these there are numerous ligamentous bands, the most of them largely composed of yellow fibrous tissue, which serve to close in the gaps between nearly related cartilages, and by their elasticity to i^estore the connected parts when they have been displaced by the action of muscles. The names which these ligaments bear are suggestive of situation and action, as they are mostly composed of the names of the cartilages which they connect, and usuallyalso containsome indication of their relative position. 49 the arytenoids are jointed with the surfaces LATERAL THYRO- HYOID LIGAMENT front. i. »i3.~ Laryngeal cartilages and ligaments from in (Testut.)

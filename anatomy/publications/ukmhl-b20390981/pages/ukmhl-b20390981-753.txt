It begins in the right and lower portion of the abdomen, passes upward and backward to the under surface of the liver, thence across the belly to the spleen, Fig. 779.—The stomach and intestines, front view, the great omentum having been removed, and the liver turned up and to the right. The dotted line shows the normal position of the anterior border of the liver. The dart points to the foramen of Winslow. (Testut.) from this point downward and forward to the left and lower ])art of the abdomen, here makes a number of curves, and finally plunges into the pelvis at its back part, and ends close to the perineum, near the inner opening of the anal canal.

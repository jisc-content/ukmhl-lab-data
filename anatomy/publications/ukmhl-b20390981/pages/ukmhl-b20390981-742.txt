For generations it has been customary to divide the abdomen into nine regions for convenience of description : one near the centre, called umbilical, with a tnni- FiG. 763.â€”Regions of the abdomen, delimited by the author's method. (F. H. G.) bar on each side; above the umbilical, the epigastric ("upon the stomach"), with a hypochondriac (" under the cartilage") on each side ; and below the umbilical, the hypogadric (" under the stomach"), with an iliac on each side. The delimitation of these regions is not uniformly made by authors. The writer called attention to this fact and to the need of agreement among anatomists some years ago, and embodied his suggestions in a paper read to the Association of American Anatomists in 1892. Having seen no proposition which appears more reasonable and useful in the premises, he presents his plan here. A line is drawn around the body at the level of the anterior superior sj^inous processes of the ilium, and another at the lowest /joint of the tenth costal cartilages. These lines stand for the peripheries of horizontal planes, which completely divide the abdomen into three sections. Each section is cut into three by a ver- tical plane running ventro-dorsally through the middle of each inguinal (Poupart's) liganicnf. These are superficially indicated on the front of tlie abdomen in Fig. 763. The advantages of this method are that it brings the umbilicus wliolly into the umbilical region, which is rather rarely the case, when the lower horizontal is drawn at the level of the iliac crests ; that the guide to the ujiper horizontal is a prominence easily found through the integuments, and that this plane divides the part of the abdomen above the lower horizontal more equally than does that

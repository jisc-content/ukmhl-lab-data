532 THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. The Thalami (Figs. 587, 588). The thalami, often called thalami optici (" oi^tic couches "), are large masses of gray substance of irregular shape, presenting mesial, upper, and back surfaces, Fig. 587.—Median section through the third and fourth ventricles. Left half. M. C, middle commissure. (Testut.) whicli are free, and under and outer surfaces, which are attached, being blended with contiguous parts of the brain. The free surtaces are covered with a tliin layer of white nervous tissue. Tlie mesial surface of each is flattened, and forms Fig. 588.—Third vuutrirle frmn above. The upper surface of the thalami, the epiphysis, and the corpora quadrigemina are seen. (Testut.) a side wall of the third ventricle from floor to roof. The boundary between the mesial and upper sui-faces is marked by a white band, the stalk of the epiphysis, extending from the anterior pillar of the fornix in front to the epiphysis behind.

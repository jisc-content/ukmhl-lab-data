404 THE BLOOD-VASCULAIi SYSTEM. ganglia and other structures in the floor of the lateral ventricle. One of these vessels is of special interest, the Icnticulo-striate artery, called also Charcot's artery of cerebral hemorrhage, because it is a very common site of arterial rup- ture in cases of apoplexy. This vessel is situated between the external capsule and the corpus striatum. The cortical brain substance of the motor area is also supplied by the middle meningeal (Sylvian) artery, and here arterial lesions are common and often produce localizing symptoms. After discussing the vertebral artery, which with the internal carotid supplies the encephalon, the arterial sup- ply of the brain will be given more in detail. ARTERIES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITIES. THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The subclavian arferi/ (Fig. 452) takes its origin on the left side from the arch of the aorta, on the right side from the brachio-cephalic artery. Each vessel passes upward and outward into the neck, and then arches downward and out- ward to terniinate at the lower border of the first rib in the axillary. Each ves- VERTEBRAL Fig. 452.â€”Subclavian and axillary arteries. (Testut.) sel is divided into three portions, according to its situation with reference to the scalenus anterior mu.scle. The first portions of the subclavian arteries differ, and must be described separately. A single description will answer for the second and third jiortions of both arteries. The first portion of the left subclavian arises from the arch of the aorta, and extends to the inner border of the scalenus anterior muscle. The vessel is deeply situated and in the lower part of its course somewhat resembles the brachio- cephalic artery.

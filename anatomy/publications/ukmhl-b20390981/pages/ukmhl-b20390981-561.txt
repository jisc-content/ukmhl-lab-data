545 THE OBLONGATA. Fig. 602.—Cerebellum in nearly horizontal section—the i .-urfuee of the lower section. (Testut.) THE OBLONGATA. The oblongata, also called medulla oblongata (" the oblong marrow"), and the spinal bulb, extends from the lower margin of the pons to a plane passing trans- versely just below the decussation of the pyramids, at which level the spinal cord begins. It is shaped somewliat like an inverted truncated cone, flattened ventro- FiG. 603.—Semidiagram of the three cerebellar Fig. 604.—The pons and oblongata, ventral peduncles. (Testut.) view. (Testut.) On the ventral surface is a longitudinal cleft, the rentro-median fissure, which begins above in a little pit, the foramen ccecum (" blind hole "), and is interrupted below by a criss-cross of nerve-bundles. On each side of the ventro-median fissure is a white body, gradually dwindling from above downward, and seeming to be directly continuous with the ventral column of the cord. These are the ventral pyramids, and the interlocking of the bundles at their lower part across the ventro-median fissure (constituting the above-mentioned cris.s-cross) is called the decussation of the jji/ramids. At the outer side of each pyramid is a cleft, the ventro-lcderal fissure, which is in line with the series of origins of the ventral roots of the spinal nerves. On each side the oblongata presents a vertical mass, the lateral column, or lateral tract, which is apparently continuous below with the lateral column of the cord, and above is encroached upon at the front part by a large ovoid mass, 35

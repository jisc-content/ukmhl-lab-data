THE VEINS. 483 crosses obliquely behind the artery, so as to be internal to it in the upper part of Scar2)a's triangle. It is joined by tributaries corresponding to the branches of the artery, including the iDeep Femoral Vehi (which ascends in fi'ont of its artery), and also, near its upper end, by the internal saphenous vein. It contains three or four valves, one of which is just above the opening of the profunda vein, and another just below the inguinal ligament. At its upper end it is separated inter- nally from the crural canal by a thin septum of fascia, passing between the front and rear walls of the femoral sheath.

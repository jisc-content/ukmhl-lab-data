THE NERVES. 570 and the ascending vago-glossopharyngeal and fifth roots extending still lower down. In Fig. 632 the motor nuclei are represented (in red), in Fig. 633 the Fig. 631—Diagram of the course of the optic fibres. (W. Keiller, after Testut.) sensory nuclei (in blue). The motor nvdei are arranged in two interrupted columns, the third, fourth, sixth, and twelfth motor nuclei forming one column close to the middle line, and very near the floor of the aqueduct, fourth ventricle or central canal; while the motor nuclei of the fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh form another column, more deeply and more laterally situated than the first and deviating somewhat toward the side above, where the ventricle is widest. The fifth nerve has a well-marked ascending root, which is probably motor, as well as a crossed motor root. The spinal portion of the spinal accessory arises from the cells of the ventral horn of gray matter as low as the sixth or seventh cervical nerve. Coming now to the scvsm'y midei, each sensory nerve has an ascending root. Thus the fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and accessory portion of the eleventh have each an ascending root which ajipears to bring it into relation with the nucleus of the funiculus cuneatus and gelatinous substance of Rolando (compare the con- nection of the sensory roots of the sjiinal nerves with the same nuclei). Each nerve has in addition a special sensory nucleus—the eighth nucleus is divisible into three groups—near the level of its point of exit and dorso-lateral to the motor nuclei. In lonf/itudinal extent the nucleus of the third nerve occupies the floor of the aqueduct from the posterior commissure to the groove between the superior and inferior quadrigeminal bodies, the nucleus of the fourth lies ventrally to tlie testis, the fifth nucleus nearly corresponds to the lateral recess, the sixth lies under the eminentia teres, the eighth nuclei are on a level with the striae acusticas, and the

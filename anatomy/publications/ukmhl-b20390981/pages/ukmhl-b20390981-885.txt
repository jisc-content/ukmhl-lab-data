SURFACE ANATOMY. The subject of tlie pliotoijraph.-, of wliicli the series of picture* in thi.« section are reproductions, wa.s a younp;- athlete of well-lialanced doveloj^nient. It would be easy to procure representations of a man with much larger muscle.*, but they would be less useful in the illustration of normal anatomy. The main purpose of these engravings is to show the relations of structures, especially muscles, to the surface. The most of them are accompanied by keys, which more than sup- ply the place of verbal description ; in the remainder the principal features are sufficiently apparent Mithout explanation other than occurs in the legend. Every student is earnestly advised to study surface anatomy upon the living model. Each can use his chum for this juirpose, if he will reeijiroeate such favors as he receives ; and many things he can learn from his own person. ])articularly M'ell in front of a large mirror. He should carry his studies in this direction much further than is attempted in this series of pictures, and in this effort he will derive all the help that he needs from the numerous cuts which embelli:-h the pages devoted to descriptive anatomy.

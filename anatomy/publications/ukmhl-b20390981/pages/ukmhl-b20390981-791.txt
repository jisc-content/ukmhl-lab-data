GHOSS ANATOMY OF THE LUNGS. 763 vessels, and other structures iu the mediastinal space. Each lung presents an outer surface, which is convex, and adapted to the inner surface of the chest-wall of one side ; an internal or mesial surface, which is irregularly concave and occu- pied by mediastinal organs; an under surface or base, very concave and fitting to the upper surface of the diaphragm ; a summit or apex, which rises an inch above the level of the first rib ; a hind border, rounded, vertical, and adjusted to the Fig. 821.—Right lung, outer surfuoe. (Testut.) Fig. 822.—Left lung, outer surface. (Testut.) long hollow made by the bodies of the thoracic vertcljrse and the proximal portion of corresponding ribs ; a front border, thin, irregular, and sloping from above downward and outward to the level of the fifth or sixth rib ; and a louer bordci-, bevelled sliarjily at the expense of the lower surface, and marking the under limit of the outer surface. On the inner surface, three quarters way back from the front line, and about Fig. 823.—Lungs, dorsal view. (Testut.) equally distant from apex and base, is a vertical notch, the IrUum, two inches long and an inch or more broad, which gives passage to the air-ducts, pulmonary artery and veins, bronchial artery and veins, lymph-vessels, and nerves, and affords lodgment to a considerable number of lym])h-nodes. These different organs in the hilum are united into one large fagot, called the root of the lung. The inner surface of the left lung is much more deeply concaved than that of the right, on account of the greater encroachment of the heart upon the space at

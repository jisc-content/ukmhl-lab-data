77 EMBRYOLOGY. By J. p. McMURRICH. AT one period of its existence every vertebrate animal is represented by a single J\. cell, from which the adult individual develops by its repeated division and by the functional and histological differentiation of the aggregate of cells so formed. The cell, however, which has the power of undergoing this development is one which results from the complete fusion of two distinct elements, likewise cells, one of which is termed the ovum, and represents the female element of reproduction, the other being the spermatozoon, the male element. Spermatogenesis. The male cell is formed in the testis, and, if a section of a seminiferous tubule be examined, an arrangement will be seen which is re2>resented diagramatically in Fig. 85. The cells lining each tubule are arranged in several layers, the outermost Fig. 85.â€”Development, of spermatozoa. layer being formed principally by a number of cells known as ftpennaiogoncs. Each of these from time to time divides, one of the cells so produced persisting as a spermatogone, while the other becomes what is termed a primary spermato- cyte. This cell later divides into two cells, each of which is a secondary sperma- tocyte, and these, undergoing a further division, give rise to cells termed spermntkls. Thus, from each jirimary spermatocyte, by two divisions, four spermatids are developed, and each of these last becomes a spermatozoon. In addition to these various cells, others are to be found resting upon the basement membrane of the tubule, and extending through the various layers of the developing cells, the spermatozoa being grouped upon their inner ends. These are the Sertoli cells, or supporting cells, and they do not take any part in the formation of the spermato-

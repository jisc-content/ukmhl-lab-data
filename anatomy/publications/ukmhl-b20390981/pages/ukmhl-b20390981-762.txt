The anal canal (Figs.791-793) is the channel l)y which the rectum is placed in con- nection with the external surface of the body. It is an inch long, and runs down- ward and backward. It is lined with a membrane, wliich is mucous at the upper end, cutaneous at the lower, and a cross between the two elsewhere. Outside of this lining is an embracing muscle, the inicrnal .sphincter, composed of bundles of smooth fibres, arranged circularly. The lateral walls of the tube are in con- tact, and the lining membrane is disposed in small, longitudinal folds. The distal aperture is the anus, and around it the skin is dark brown, and puckered in radiating lines. GLANDS ACCESSOEY TO THE ALIMENTARY TUBE. In the development of the digestive canal bud-like processes grow out from it at several points, and ultimately become glands, furni.shing abundant secretions, which are discharged into the tube through ducts. These glands are the sali- vary, the pancreas, and the liver, and they will now be considered in the order given. THE SALIVARY GLANDS. The saliva, is a compound fluid, resulting from the mixture of the secretions of a number of glands, wliich discharge their products into the mouth. There are many vtneo)is glauds, two collections of which on each side require mention. One is at the hind part of the oral jiortion of the tongue, at the side and below, and is called the gland of Wchcr (Fig. 794, gl. w.). The other is beneath the lateral border of the tongue near the tip, and is known as the gland of Blandin (Fig. 794, GL. B. and Fig. 758). The so-called salivary corpuscles are derived from the tonsils. But the great volume of the saliva is furnished by three pairs of glands—the parotid, the submaxillary, and the sublingual. Of these the first

655 THE HKIN. a fibrous c;ipsiile sending septa into the interior. One or more mediillated fibres either at once enter the corpuscle, or first wind round it several times. On entering, the nerve loses its medullary sheath^ and its axis cylinder breaks up into fil)rils, which ramify minutely through the corpuscle, oval swellings forming on the branches. End bulbs of spheroidal form are found in the papilke of the skin of the lips, of the glans penis and glans clitoridis, in the conjunctiva, in the mucous mem- brane of the cheeks, soft palate, tongue, epiglottis, and rectum. Similar organs are found in the sheaths of nerve trunks. These bodies consist of a connective- tissue capsule containing nucleated cells, among which the axis cylinder of the nerve terminates. Pacinian Corpuscles (Fig. 700) are small, seed-like bodies, to -^^ of an inch l(»ng, and -^-^ to .^V of an inch thick, found in clusters on the digital nerves of the hand and foot, and in many other situations. A Pacinian cor])uscle is lamel- lated like an onion, having in some cases 40 to 60 coats, the inner Inminas thinner and more closely packed than the outer. The laraellaj are fibrous in character. Fig. 700.—Pacinian corpuscle in vertical section. (Testut.) continuous with the layers of the perineurium, and have lymph-spaces between them. In the centre of the body is an elongated, homogeneous core, into which the nerve penetrates. It courses along the middle of the core till it approaches the opposite end of the coi'puscle, and then divides into processes, which end in bulbous extremities. Each corpuscle is supplied with a small capillary vessel, and has a distinct fibrous capsule. • NAILS AND HAIRS. The nails and hairs are formed of modified epithelium on a special dermal substratum.

THORACIC FASCIA. 353 gradually thins out and merger into the areolar tissue of the posterior medias- tinum. In front of it are the pharynx and oesophagus, behind it the prevertebral muscles. Peculiar interest attaches to these different portions of the cervical fascia on account of their influence upim the direction which accumulations of fluid will take when occurring in this region (Fig. 412). Fluid in front of the outer layer Fig. 412.â€”The cervical fascia as seen in sagittal sectiou. (Testut.) is confined to the subcutaneous region; between th,e outer and middle layers is kept from descending by the sternum ; between the middle and inner or pre- vertebral is guided into the pharynx and oesophagus, or possibly into the larynx; and behind the last layer may be steered into the mediastinum. THORACIC FASCIA. This name, though often limited to the fascia of the pectoralis major, is much more fittingly applied to the entire series of fasciae of the antero-lateral region of the chest, and is here employed in this sense. The Pectoral Fascia. The pectoral fascia (Fig. 413), thin and weak, covers the pectoralis major, and its attachments coincide with the margins of origin of this muscle. It turns around the lower border of the muscle and spreads upward over the hind surface. At the line where it makes the bend it is continuous with the true axillary fascia, a thick, strong membrane, which crosses the base of the armpit, describing an arch in its course, unites with the foscia which encases the latissimus, and through 23

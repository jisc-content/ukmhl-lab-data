454 THE VEINS. By G. WOOLSEY. THE veins are the vessels through whicli tlie blood is returned from the capil- laries to the heart. Like the arteries, they may be divided into the pul- monary and the systemic. THE PULMONARY VEINS. These consist of two large, short trunks on either side, in the root of the corresponding king (Fig. 490). They extend nearly horizontally inward and for- ward from the hilum of the lung to the upper part of the back of the left auricle. They lie in front of and below the corresponding pulmonary arteries, and on ]iiercing the pericardium they are invested on their ventral aspect only by the Fig, 490â€”Pulmonary veins, seen in a dorsal view of the heart and lungs. (Testut.) I i serous layer of that membrane. The two rir/hf pulmonary veins pass behind the superior vena cava, the ascending portion of the aorta, and the right auricle. The two left pulmonary veins pass in front of the descending portion of the aorta. They convey arterial blood, and have no valves.

602 THE NERVES. The dorsal divisions of the sixth, seventh, and eighth cei'vical nerves divide like the others into internal and external branches ; but both these branches are distributed to muscles only. The Dorsal Primary Division of the First Cervical or Suboccipital Nerve (Fig. 655).—The first cervical or suboccipital nerve leaves the cranio-vertebral canal by passing between the occipital bone and the dorsal arch of the atlas. The dorsal division, slightly larger than the ventral, passes backward under tlie ver- tebral artery, and enters the suboccipital triangle. Tliis space is bounded by the rectus capitis posterior major internally, the obliquus inferior infero-externally, and the obliquus superior supero-externally. Here the nerve divides into the Fig. C54.—Dorsal primary divisions of the spinal nerves. (Tcstut.) following four branches : {a) a branch to the obliquus inferior which furnishes an | anastomotic filament to the great occipital nerve ; (6) a bi'anch running upward j to the recti capitis posteriores major and minor; (c) a third branch enters the | obliquus superior; {(1) and a fourth Ijranch supplies the coniplexus on its deep j surface. j The Great Occipital Nerve (Figs. 654, 655).—The dor.sal primary division of I the second cervical verve is thi'ee or four times as large as the ventral division. Its ! exfernetl branch is small and is distributed to the inferior oblique, complexus, and I trachelomastoid; but the internal branch is large, and from its size and distribu- ' tion is called the Great Occipital Nerve.

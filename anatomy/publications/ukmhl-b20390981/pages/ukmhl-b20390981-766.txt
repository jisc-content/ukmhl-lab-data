738 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. The arteries of the pancreas are branches of the splenic and hepatic, and the inferior pancreatico-duodenalis from the superior mesenteric. Its nerves come from the solar plexus. Fig. 798.â€”Ducts of the pancreas. Part of the front wall of the duodenum is cut away. (Testut.) THE LIVER. The largest and most complex of the appendao^es of the alimentary tube is the liver {hepar). Starting as a bud from the duodenum in the second week of embryonic life, it grows with such rapidity that by the second month its weight is one-third of that of the entire b(xly. Though not retaining this relative magni- tude, it remains as the greatest gland of the body, and the most intricate. PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. Physiologically considered it is a community of minute livers, all substantially alike ; and thus a comprehension of one of them is sufficient to ])ut us in posse.'^- sion of the anatomical facts requisite for understanding the functions of the entire system. We are assisted in our study of the liver by comparing it to a great manu- facturing town, made up of a vast number of establishments, each of which is identical with every other in its organization, size, facilities for work, and the quality and quantity of its products. Formerly it was supposed that the only service of the liver was the formation of bile ; and although it is now known that the secretion of this fluid is only one of several offices performed by this organ, it is convenient for our present purpose to take bile-making as the tyj^e and representative of the entire group of functions. A Typical Lobule. We will begin by studying a single factory, that is, a separate lobule of the liver. It is an irregular, polyliedral body, a twelfth of an inch or less in diameter. As in every other true gland, the secreting cells are the essential part of the

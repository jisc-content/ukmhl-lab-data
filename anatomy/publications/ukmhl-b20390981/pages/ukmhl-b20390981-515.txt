THE CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. By F. H. GERRISH. THE great nervous mass which occupies the main cavity of the cranium is known as the encephalon ("in the head") or brain ; and the prolongation of this, Avhich is lodged in the canal made by the vertebrae and the cartilaginous plates between them, is called the myelon (" marrow") or .yjinal cord. Radiating from these structures are many cords, called nerves; and this fact suggested the name axis for these combined central organs, the distinguishing ^ y (o) Fig. 528.—Diagram of the conversion of the dorsal groove into a canal. adjective cerebrospinal, which is usually asso- ciated with the noun, deriving its first part from "cerebrum," which is the most conspicuous portion of the encephalon, and its last part from the column of bones in which the myelon is located (Fig. 527). The cerebro-spinal axis is first observed in the embryo as a longi- tudinal groove on its dor- sal asjject. Its edges Fig. 527.—Semidiagrammatic view of „f +lip c,V1p« the cerebro-spinal axis, left side. (Testut.) g' OW Up ai ine SlUes, curve toward the mid- line, meet there, and fuse together (Fig. 528). The result is that the gutter is changed into a tube. One end of the tube enlarges into a sac, and this develojis into the enceph- alon (Fig. 529). The remainder of the tube becomes the spinal cord. The cavity of the encephalon is always con- tinuous with that of the spinal cord. Great changes take place in both parts, especially in the encephalon ; but throughout these modifications, cer- tain things are almost invariable. In nearly all of the amazing complications of encephalic growth, three things I'emain as in the simplest form of encephalon in the embryo : (1) a cavity-wall of nervous tissue; (2) a 499 V Fig. .=)29.—Diagram of first stage of axial cavity.

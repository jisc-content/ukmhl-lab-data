845 THE MAMMARY GLANDS. is but slightly developed (even tlmufrli the breast may be plump and firm), and the nipple and areola are pink. But as early as the second month of pregnancy the color of these parts deepens, and may become dark brown, and the secreting structure begins to develop. A seconfJary areola, much fainter than the primary, may be observed encircling it. The breasts become very large and heavy during the period of nursing, but shrink when lactation is completed, and simultaneously the added pigment mostly disaj^jDears from the areola and nipple ; but the delicate rosv hue of the virgin state is never restored. After the menopause the gland shrivels into a thin disc, incapable of function ; but this diminution may not be outwardly manifest in the corpulent on account of the great accumulation of fat. During menstruation the breasts may swell, owing to sympathetic congestion. In some women the nipple does not project beyond the surface of the breast, and in certain cases it is even retracted, a dimple marking its situation. //; tlte male the mammary gland is rudimentary and minute. The nipple is small, and the areola presents a growth of rather strong hairs. Verv rarely women have supernumerarii mamina^, thus imitating many of the lower animals. One case is recorded in which a woman had eight supplementary breasts, in addition to the usual pair. On the other hand there may be entire failure of development beyond the rudimentary condition. Very phenomenally the male breast ceases to be a mere rudiment, and becomes capable of furnishing milk. Vessels and Nerves.â€”The arteries of the mamma are branches of the axillary, internal mammary, and intercostals. The veins correspond. The lyrnjjha.tics run to the axillary nodes (primarily to the pectoral group, secondarily to the others) and to the sternal. The nerves are chieHy intercostal.

The axillary artery begins where the subclavian ends, at the lower border of the first rib, passes downward and outward through the axillary space to its lower margin—/. e., the outer edge of the latissinuis, and there terminates by becoming the brachial. The artery is crossed by the pectoralis minor muscle, which divides it into three portions. The first portion is between the lower border of the first rib and the inner margin of the pectoralis minor ; the second portion is behind the pectoralis minor ; and the third portion is between the outer border of the pectoralis minor and the lower border of the axillaiy space. The relations of these three portions ditiTer, and it is well to study them separately. Relations of the First Poetiox of the Axillary Artery. In front. Skin, superficial and deep fasciae.

Xow that the student has reviewed the arteries of the leg, it is advised tliat sketches be made of transverse sections at several levels showing the position of the vessels and their relation to other structures. Fig. 487.â€”Surgical relations of the anterior tibial artery of the right leg. (Kocher.)

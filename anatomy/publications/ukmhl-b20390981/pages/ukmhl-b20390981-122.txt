THE BONES. 118 heart-shaped, only sliglitly wider transversely than from before backward, and deeper behind tlian in front. Where the body joins tlie arch two derai-facets are fonnd (Ml either side, one at tlie npper and one at the hjwer border. Eacli laeet with the contignous one on the adjacent vertebra completes a cavity for the head of a rib. The lower voiebral notches are deeper than the npper. Each broatl, flat pair of the lamince is imbricated, or sloped, over the pair below, like the tiles Fig. 137.—a thoracic vertebra, upper surface. (Tcstut.) of a roof. The spinous process is long and three-sided, and projects considerably downward, especially in the middle of the series. The trdnsverxe processes project ontward and slightly backward. The oval facets on the front of their tips are for articnlation with the tnbercles of the ribs. The rib in sitn forms with this process a costo-transverse foramen. Of the two pairs of articular processes, the articnlar Fio. 138.—Thoracic vertebra, seen from the left side. Fig. 139.—Thoracic vertebra, viewed from (Testut.) behind. (Testut.) surfaces of the upper pair look backwai'd and slightly ontward and upward, those of the lower pair forward and slightly inward and downward. The/o/'amen is round, and not as large as in the cervical or lumbar region. Peculiar Thoracic Vertebrae.—These are the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first is a transitional vertebra, resembling the lower cervical vertebrae, especially on its npper surface. The body is elongated transversely, and lipped laterally above. There are entire facets above for the first pair of ribs, and demi- facets below for the second pair. The su])erior articular processes have largely an upward direction. The spinous ])rocess is long, nearly horizontal, and even more prominent than that of the vertebra jirominens. The ninth has demi-fiicets above, but frequently none below. If the lower ones are present, it is a typical vertebra.

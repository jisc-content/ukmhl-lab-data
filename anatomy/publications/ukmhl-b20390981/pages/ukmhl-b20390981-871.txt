THE 3IAMMARY GLANDS. 843 oi the urethra. The larger, posterior portion is lost mesially in the muscular wall of the vagina. THE MAMMARY GLANDS. The two mammary glands, manuiur, or breads, are accessory organs of genera- tion, their secretion, the milk, serving to sustain the infant until it is capable of deriving its nourishment from other sources. Philosophically considered, each mamma is a collection of sebaceous glands, greatly enlarged, and extending far Fig. 903.â€”Right breast in sagittal section, inner surface of outer segment. (Testut.) into the subcutaneous region, which here is vastly deeper than elsewhere. The j secretion of the sebaceous glands is oily, and that of their prodigious congeners is I of the same character, though in the one case the fluid is devoted to purposes of lubrication, in the other to nutritive n.ses. Each breast is approximately hemispherical, and a little below the centre of its convexity presents a mammilla (nipple, teat, dug), usually shaped like a trun- cated cone, half an inch long, pointing forward, upward, and outward, and set in the middle of a circular area of darker skin, the areola. The breast covers a nearly circular space, mostly in front of the pectoralis major, extending from the second to the sixth rib, and from the sternum to the border of the armpit. The location of the nipple is usually given as at the level of the fourth rib ; but its position is dependent upon various circumstances, such j as age, pregnancy, lactation, corpulence, firmness of tissues, race, attitude of body, I (not to mention numerous diseases), so that it becomes one of the least trust- worthy of landmarks.

THE AUDITORY ORGAN. Ill which rests in one of the tliree unossitied spots of the osseous capsule of the inter- nal ear, the foramen ovale, seems to be really the portion of the wall of the cap- sule which should fill tliis foramen, the mesenchyme immediately around it having remained membranous, wliile its arch is the ossified upper end of tlie cartihige of the second branchial arch. These bones are at first imbedded in the gelatinous tissue of the wall of the tympanic cavity. After birth, air is taken into this cavity through the Eustachian tube, and the cavity enlarges, pressing aside the gelati- nous tissue and surrounding bones, which thus form a chain extending from tlie tympanic membrane to the foramen ovale, and apparently passing through the middle of the tympanic cavity, though in reality they are enclosed by the mucous membrane which lines the cavity. Two of the three unossified spaces in the wall of the osseous capsule of the inner ear have been accounted for in the ductus perilymphaticns and the foramen ovale ; the third opening is the foramen rofimdiun, which is closed by a membrane on which the scala tympani abuts. The outer wall of the tympanic cavity is formed by the tympanic membrane, and is at first thick with the gelatinous tissue which encloses the auditory ossicles, it being only after birth that it is reduced to the thin membrane found in the adult. It is formed partly by the partition between the external and internal grooves of the first branchial cleft, and partly by the upper ends of the first and second l)ranchial arches. Just as the inner groove of the first branchial cleft forms the Eustachian tube and tympanum, so the upper end of the outer groove of the same cleft forms the outer ear, the pinna developing from elevations ap]iearing on the first and second visceral arches in the vicinity of the persistent part of the groove.

(n.s. vol. ii.), and was illustrated by numerous histological specimens and micro-photos of specimens. Dr Alex. Hill was surprised at the measurements of the cells of Clarke’s column given by Dr Mott, and in speaking of their develop- ment, said they appeared after those of the anterior column. Professor Charles Stewart asked what fibres proceeded from th<\ cells which Dr Mott had drawn. Dr Mott replied that his method was calculated to show the exact size of the cells, and that they all had fibres. Professor Bertram Windle then read a paper on the Arteries at the Base of the Brain, which paper is printed in extenso in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxii. (n.s. vol. ii.), p. 289. Mr Black spoke of a case in which the internal carotid made a complete spiral before entering the skull. Professor Alex.

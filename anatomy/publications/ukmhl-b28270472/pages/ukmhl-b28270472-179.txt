MUSCULAK SYSTEM OP PISHES. 163 LECTURE VII. MUSCULAR SYSTEM OF FISHES. The modification of the muscles, or active organs of motion, and their deviation from the fundamental veiâ€™tehrate type, proceed conco- mitantly with the metamorphosis of the passive organs of motion, as the Myelencephala rise in the scale and gain higher and more varied endowments : therefore, as the segments of the skeleton preserve the greatest amount of uniformity in the lowest class, so does the principle of vegetative repetition most prevail in the corresponding- segments of the muscular system. The chief masses of this system in ordinary Osseous Fishes are disposed on each side of the trunk, in a series of vertical flakes or segments, corresponding in number with the vertebrae. Each lateral flake {Myocomma, fig. 44. a, b, c) is attached by its inner border to Muscular system, Perea fluviatilis. the osseous and aponeurotic parts of the corresponding vertically extended segment of the endo-skeleton, by its outer border to the skin, and by its fore and hind surfaces to an aponeurotic septum common to it and the contiguous myocommata. The gelatinous tissue of these septa is dissolved by boiling, and the muscular seg- vor.. II. *jj 2

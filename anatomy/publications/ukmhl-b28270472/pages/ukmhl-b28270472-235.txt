DENTAL SYSTEM OF FISHES. 219 a branch of the anterior division of the fifth nerve enters each fol- licle, makes a coil there, and quits it to join another filament, or to return to its own stem.* LECTURE IX. DIGESTIYE SYSTEM OF FISHES. Dentition. The teeth of fishes, whether we study them in regard to their num- ber, form, substance, structure, situation, or mode of attachment, ofirer a greater and more striking series of varieties than do those of any other class of animals. As to number, they range from zero to countless quantities. The Lancelet, the Ammocete, the Sturgeon, the Paddle-fish 61. a. h.), and the whole order of Lophobranchii, are edentulous. The Myxinoids have a single pointed tooth on the roof of the mouth, and two serrated dental plates on the tongue. The Carp has a single grinding tooth on the occiput, opposed to two dentigerous pharyngeal jaws below. In the Lepidosiren a single maxillary dental plate is opposed to a single mandibular one, and there are two small denticles on the nasal bone. In the extinct Sharks with crushing teeth, called Ceratodus and Ctenodus, the jaws were armed with four teeth, two above and two below. In the Chimaerae two mandibular teeth are opposed to four maxillary teeth. From this low point the number in different fishes is progressively multiplied until, in the Pike, the Silurus, and many other fishes, the mouth becomes crowded with innumerable teeth. With respect to form, I may first observe, that as organised beings withdraw themselves more and more, in their ascent in the scale of life, from the infiuence of common physical agents, so their parts pro- gressively deviate from geometrical figures: it is only, therefore, in the lowest vertebrated class that we find teeth in the form of perfect cubes, and of prisms or plates with three {Myletes), four (Scarus), * Lxxvi. p. 332. pi. iii. figs. 10. 12.

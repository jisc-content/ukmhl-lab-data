25 THE SICELETON. osseous : the exo- and splanchno-skeletons may offer also another, or fourth condition, viz. the albuminous, or epidermal. The most common tissue of the endo-skeleton of the Vertebrata is that called “ bone,” and it is peculiar to this primary division of the Animal Kingdom. Bone consists of animal, chiefly gelatinous, matter, hardened by a general but regulated diffusion of earthy molecules ; the proportion of organic to inorganic matter varies in different classes. Fishes have the least. Birds the largest proportion of earthy matter; and of the two, in this respect, intermediate classes, the Mammalia, espe- cially the active predatory species, have more earth, or harder bones, than Reptiles. This difference depends chiefly upon the quantity of fluid, or evaporable matter, in the cells and tubes of the animal basis, but not wholly, as some have supposed; at least the apparently exact, certainly most carefully and scientiflcally conducted experi- ments of M. Bibra (rv.) on thoroughly di’ied portions of bone, show the following differences: — PKOPORTIONS OF EARTHY AND ANIMAL MATTER IN THE BONES OP VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. FISHES. Salmon. Carp. Cod.

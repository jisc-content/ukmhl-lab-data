The Batrachian Reptile has more animal matter in its bones than the Ophidian or Saurian, and thus more resembles the Fish. Serpents almost approach Birds in the great proportion of the earthy salts, and hence the density and ivory-like whiteness of their bones. The typical bones of Birds are the whitest and most compact of all bones, by reason of their large proportion of earthy matter, and also of the absence of marrow from their capacious pneumatic cavities, on which their lightness depends : in those bones of Birds from which air is excluded, the oily marrow deadens the whiteness of the tissue, and it is often difiicult to get rid of the greasy surface in skeletons. The nature of the inorganic or hardening particles, and of the organic basis, according to the analysis by Bibra of completely dried portions of bone, is exemplified in the subjoined table, including a species of each of the four classes of Vertebrata.

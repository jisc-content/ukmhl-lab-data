It has the advantage, now-a-days somewhat rare, of being equally instructive to the student and practitioner; and we know- of no better manual on the chemical analysis of the blood and urine to place in the hands of those who are joining themselves as pupils to the newly-founded schools of practical chemistry in this metropolis.”—Medical Gazette.

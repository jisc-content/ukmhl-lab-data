The vertebrae of the head are usually enumerated in a direction contrary to those of the trunk, because, like the vertebras of the tail, they lose their typical character as they recede from the com- mon centre.* The names of the cranial vertebrse are taken from those applied in Anthropotomy to the bones composing their neural spines, and the names of the neural arches from the significant terms lately given (xxn. t. i. p. 145.), to the primaiy segments of the brain, which they respectively protect. Each cranial vertebra, or natural segment of the skull, is divided into a neural arch, with which the centrum and parapophyses are always more immediately connected, and a hcemal arch with its appendages. The neural arches are: — Nos. of component bones in the Cuts. I. Epencephalic arch (1, 2, 3, 4); II. Mesencephalic arch (5 to 8); III. Prosencephalic arch (9—12); IV. Rhinencephalic arch (13—15), The hasmal arches are: — i. Scapular, or scapulo-coracoid (50 to 52) ; ii. Hyoid, or stylo-hyoid (25, 38 to 43); iii. Mandibular, or tympano-mandibular (25—32) ; iv. Maxillary, or palato-maxillary (20—22). The appendages of the hasmal arches are : — 1. The Pectoral (54 to 57) ; 2. The Branchiostegal (44) ; 3. The Opercular (34—37) ; 4. The Pterygoid (23, 24). B. The bones of the splanchno-skeleton constitute : — The ear-capsule or petrosal, and otolite (16, 16"); The eye-capsule or sclerotic, and pedicle (17) ; The nose-capsule or aethmoid, and turbinal (18, 19) ; The branchial arches (45—49). ♦ We find the leading condition of these terminal modifications of the vertebral column in the fact, that the contained nervous axis shrinks and recedes centripctally at both ends.

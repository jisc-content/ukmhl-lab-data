Fcp. 8vo. illustrated by woodcuts, 7s. Cd. cloth. “ The whole of Miss Acton’s recipes, ‘ with a few trifling exceptions, which are scrupulously specified, are confined to such as may be perfectly depended on from having been proved be- neath our own roof, and under our own personal inspection.’ We add, moreover, that the recipes arc alt reasonable, and never in any instance extravagant. Tliey do not bid us sacrifice ten pounds of excellent meat, that we may get a couple of quarts of gravy from it; nor do they deal with butter and ejrgs as if they cost nothing. Miss Acton’s bonk is a gond book in every way; there is right-mindedness in every page of it, as well as thorough knowledge and e.x- ' perience of the subjects she handles.”—jMedica l Gazette. iMtatfal anti ^urgtfal 81lorttiS.

NERVOUS SYSTEM Oi' FISHES. ^ ^ nation with the retractores pubis, tend to compress the abdomen, to constrict the anus, and to depress the tail. The muscles of the pectoral fins, though, compared with those of the homologous members in higher vertebrates, they are very small, few, and simple, yet suffice for all the requisite movements of the fins; elevating, depressing, advancing, and again laying them prone and flat, by an oblique stroke, upon the sides of the body. The rays or digits of both pectorals and ventrals, as well as those of the median fins, can be divaricated and approximated, the intervening webs spread out or folded up, and the extent of surface required to react upon the ambient medium in each change and degiee of motion, can be duly regulated at pleasure. LECTURE VIII. NEKVOUS SYSTEM OF FISHES. The neural axis is a simple continuous chord in the Lancelet {Branchiostoma, Jig.4:6, md.), of opaline sub-transparency, ductile Diagram of Anatomy of the Lancelet, Brarichwstoma. and elastic, flattened, composed entirely of nucleated cells * showing a feeble indication of a median linear arrangement, which becomes more general and distinct at the anterior end, where the axis becomes cylindrical and terminates obtusely: the nerves, trigeminal {ob), and optic (op), in connection with this slightly modified part of the axis, indicate it to be the brain. This is the most simple persistent con- dition of the central organs of the nervous system known in the vertebrate sub-kingdom: it is typified by that of the Entozoa in the articulate sub-kingdom. In all other Fishes the fore part of the neural axis receives the vagal, trigeminal, and special-sense nerves. • I’rof. Goodsir, Ixxxix.

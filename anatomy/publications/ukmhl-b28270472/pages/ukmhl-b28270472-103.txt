87 THE SKULL OF OSSEOUS FISHES. formation of the cranial cavity of man and most Mammals, has no share in its formation in the lower Vertebrata. The two classes of cranial and facial bones, having been originally founded upon the exclusive study of the most peculiarly and ex- tremely modified skull in the whole Vertebrate series — that of Man, —their characters, as might be expected, are artificial, and applicable to the same bones in only a small proportion of the Vertebrata; the unity of the plan pervading the oi’ganisation of which it is the business of the Anatomist, properly so called, to demonstrate. The bones of the skull of Fishes are primarily divisible into those of A. Neuro-skeleton ; B. Splanchno-skeleton ; c. Dermo-skeleton. A. The bones of the neuro- or proper endo-skeleton are arranged here, as in the rest of the body, in a series of horizontally succeeding segments ; each segment consisting of an upper (neural) and a lower (haemal) arch, with a common centre, and with diverging appendages. As the bones, respectively entering into the formation of these seg- ments, are the same in relative position, and nearly the same in number, as in the typical vertebrm of the trunk—the excess arising from subdivision of peripheral elements—the same term ought to be extended to those cranial segments which has been usually restricted Uis.irticulatcd bones of the cranial vertebra: and sense-capsules, [the ha:mal arches (n, n) and appendages in diagrammatic outline,] Cod-fisli, Gadtis Morr/ma.

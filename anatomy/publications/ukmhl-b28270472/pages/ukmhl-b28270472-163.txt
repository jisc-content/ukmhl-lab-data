147 TELEOLOGY OF THE SKELETON OF FISHES. The predaceous Sharks are the most active and vigorous of fishes ; like the birds of prey they soar, as it were, in the upper regions of their atmosphere, and, without any aid from a modified respiiatoiy apparatus, devoid of an air-bladder, they habitually maintain them- selves near the surface of the sea, by the actions of their large and muscular fins. The gristly skeleton is in prospective harmony with this mode and sphere of life, and we shall subsequently find as well marked modifications of the digestive and other systems of the shark, by which the body is rendered as light, and the space which encroaches on the muscular system as small, as might be compatible with those actions. Besides, lightness, toughness and elasticity are the qualities of the skeleton most essential to the shark : to yield to the contraction of the lateral inflectors, and aid in the recoil, are the functions which the spine is mainly required to fulfil in the act of locomotion, and to which its alteimating elastic balls of fluid, and semi-ossified bi-concave vertebras, so admirably adapt it. To have had their entire skeleton consolidated and loaded with earthy matter would have been an encumbrance altogether at variance Avith the offices which the sharks are appointed to fulfil in the economy of the great deep. Yet there are some who would shut out by easily comprehended but quite gratuitous systems of progressive transmutation and self- creative foi’ces, the soul-expanding appreciations of the final pur- poses of the feeund varieties of the animal structures by which Ave are drawn nearer to the great First Cause. They see nothing more in this modification of the skeleton, Avhich is so beautifully adapted to the exigencies of the highest organised of fishes, than a foreshowing of the cartilaginous condition of the reptilian embryo in an enormous tadpole, arrested at an incomplete stage of typical development. But they have been deceived by the common name given to the Plagio- stomous fishes: the animal basis of the shark’s skeleton is not cartilage ; it is not that consolidated jelly Avhich forms the basis of the bones of higher Vertebrates : it has more resemblance to mucus; it requires 1000 times its Aveight of boiling water for its solution, and is neither precipitated by infusion of galls, nor yields any gelatine upon evaporation. In like manner the modifications of the dermal skeleton of fishes have been viewed too exclusively in a retrospective relation Avith the prevalent character of the skeleton of the Invertebrate animals. Doubtless it is in the lowest class of Vertebi’ata that the examples of great and exclusive development of the exo-skeleton are most nume- rous ; but some anatomists, in their zeal to trace the serial progression of animal forms, seem to have lost sight of all the vertebrate instances

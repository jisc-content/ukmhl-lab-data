TELEOLOGY OF THE SKELETON OF FISHES. 155 may live. You may wituess the tactile action of the pectoral fins when gold fish are transferred to a strange vessel: their eyes are so placed as to prevent their seeing what is below them; so they compress their air-bladder, and allow themselves to sink near the bottom, which they sweep as it were, by rapid and delicate vibrations of the pectoral fins, apparently ascertaining that no sharp stone or stick projects up- wards, wliich might injure them in their rapid movements round their prison. If the pectorals are to perform a special office of exploration certain digits are liberated from the web, and are specially endowed with nervous power for a finer sense of touch, as we see in the gur- nards, where they compensate for the loss of the tactile property con- sequent on the hard covering of the exterior of the mouth in these mailed-cheeked fishes (Joues cuirassees, Cuv.) Certain Lophioids living on sand-banks that are left dry at low water, are enabled to hoji after the retreating tide by a special prolongation of the carpal joint of the pectoral fin, which fin in these ‘frog-fishes’ projects like the limb of a terrestrial quadruped and presents two distinct segments clear of the trunk. The sharks, whose form of body and strength of tail enable them to swim near the surface of the ocean, are further adapted for this sphere of activity and compehsated for the absence of an air-bladder by the large proportional size and strength of their pectoral fins, which take a greater share in their active and varied evolutions than they can do in ordinary fishes. The flat-bodied Rays, equally devoid of an air-bladder, and with a long and slender tail, deprived of its ordinary propelling powers, grovel at the bottom ; hut have a still greater development of the hands, which surpass in breadth the whole trunk, and react with greater force upon it in raising it from the bottom, by virtue of a special modification of the scapular ai’ch, which is dii’ectly attached to the dorsal vertebne. Nor is the pectoral member restricted in length where its office, in subserviency to the special exigencies of the fish, demands a develop- ment in that direction ; the fingers of the Exoccetus or Dactylopterus, are as long, and the web which they sustain as broad, as in the ex- panded wing of the flying mammal. Everywhere, whatever re- semblance or analogy we may perceive in the ichtliyic modifications of the Vertebrate skeleton to the lower forms or the embryos of the higher classes, we shall find such analogies to ho the result of special adaptations for the 2>urpose or function for whicli that part of the fish is designed. The ventral fins or homologues of the hind-legs are still more rudimental — still more embryonic, having in view the compari-

The Diverging Appendage of the palato-maxillary arch consists,, in Fishes, of the pterygoid-and entopterygoid bones,..which, as they, are the least important parts of the arch, so are theyfthe least constant: they are wanting, for example, iu the Synodon, Platystac.us, Hydro- cydn, andLophius'; are connate with, or,indistinguishable from, the palatine in most Salmonoidsmnd Eels ; whilst in the Muroena a single bone, the pterygoid, exists, hut is disconnected with the maxillary arch.' Most Fishes, howevorj present, as.in,the,God, the two bones above named. ento-pterygoid (Jig. 30. 23) is an oblong, thin, scale-like bone, attached to the inner border of the co-adapted halves of the palatine and tvuq q)tcrygo,id^, and.friyreasing

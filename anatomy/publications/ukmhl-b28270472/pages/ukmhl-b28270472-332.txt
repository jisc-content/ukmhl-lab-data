Hughes, M.D. Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Assistant-Physician to Guy’s Hospital, &c. Fcp. 8vo. 6s. cloth. “ Dr. Hughes has given in this volume the most complete and practical exposition with which we are acquainted of the means of diagnosis derivable from auscultation and percussion. His aim ivas to present to the student a concise, intelligible, and correct account of the various means by which the several forms of thoracic disease are at present diagnosticated. And this design we conceive Dr. Hughes has carried out with great success; his descriptions are conveyed in plain, forcible, and intelligible language, and the characters and modifications of all the thoracic sounds usually encountered in practice are faithfully expressed. We therefore confidently recommend Dr. Hughes’s work to the student as an inseparable com- panion to the stethoscope, throughout the whole period of his hospital studies.” MEDICO-ChIRURGICAL REVIEW^ “ A very excellent work, which cannot fail to be of great use to the attentive student. In it he will find every information requisite to direct his proceedings in the clinical study of auscultation. Every page shows that the author has learnt what he teaches from the book of nature as well as from the writings of his predecessors.” British and Foreign Medical Review. “That a really practical manual of auscultation for students has been long required cannot be doubted. Dr. Hughes has, we conceive, been perfectly successful in supplying the desideratum. AVe recommend this volume to the student as an inseparable companion to the stethoscope throughout the whole period of his hospital studies.”—Medical Gazette.

But the single concave surface presented by the basi-occipital to the vertebrte of the trunk, the lower transverse pro- cesses {parapoj)hyses) of the abdominal vertebr®, and the articulation of the scapulo-coracoid arch to its proper cranial vertebra, afford unequivocal evidence that the Lepidosiren is a true Fish. LECTURE V. THE SKULL OF OSSEOUS FISHES. Having noticed the principal facts in the development of the skull in the embryo of an Osseous Fish, and the several stages at which that development is arrested, or diverted to acquire special modifications, in the Cartilaginous Fishes ; and having dwelt more particularly on the instructive semiosseous, semicartilaginous skull of the Lepi- dosiren, I proceed, in the present Lecture, to the demonstration of the complex skull of the Osseous Fishes, which constitute the great bulk and the typical members of the class ; and, for that purpose, I shall take one of our largest and most common species — the Cod-fish (^Gadus Morrhua)—in which you may easily repeat the observations and test the conclusions about to be submitted to you. In describing the general form and composition of this skull, according to my views of the homologies of its constituent bones, I shall also indicate the most instructive and remarkable modifications of the skull in other Osseous Fishes, and notice those which, stopping short of the acqui- sition of the most characteristic features of the fish’s skull, lead more directly to the cranial type of higher Vertebrata. The head is larger in proportion to the trunk in Fishes than in any other class of animals; it forms a cone ivhose base is vertical, directed backwards and joined to the trunk without an intervening neck, and the sides three in number, one superior and two lateral and converging downwards : the cone is shorter or longer, more or less compressed, more or less depressed, with a sharper or blunter apex, in different species. The base of the skull is perforated by the foramen

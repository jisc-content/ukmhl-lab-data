LECTURE III, 58 members of the elass. So far as the observations of M. Agassiz have extended, not one of the fossil fishes hitherto discovered in the Silurian and Devonian rocks, the most ancient in which remains of that class have been found, manifest a vertebral centrum ; and not many have shown neural and ha3mal arches and spines,* As a rule we find that the existing bony fishes have well ossified vertebrae, but retain a greater proportion, than in higher classes, of the primitive gelatinous basis, which fills up the deep concavity of each articular end of the centrum 14, c). Only in the sala- mandroid Lepidosteus, with its lung-like air-bladder, does ossification encroach upon these cavities, so as to render the anterior end of the centrum convex, the posterior end concave {Jtg. 15.), and thus unite the vei’tebras together by ball and socket joints, (xxvi. p. 59.) In the rest of the class, the vertebral bodies are connected together by a strong elastic capsule, attached to the border of the base of each terminal hollow cone, and enclosing the gelatinous fiuid, which tense y fills the biconcave space and renders the entire column light an elastic. , The vertebra of a bony fish consists essentially o a icon cave body, of two neurapophyses {fig- 16. n) completing the canal of the spinal chord, and usually supporting a spinous process {ns) ; of two parapophyses {p) usually projecting from the lower pait o t le sides of the body, or bent down to form the canal for the aorta {fig. -) ■ * Agassiz, Poissons Fossilcs dii Systeine Dcvonieii, 4to. p. xxvi

The information amassed in these volumes is literally enormous, and contemplated simply as an accumulation, it must excite astonishment as the production of an individual; but when it is further considered, that the whole of the materials have been most carefully selected from all existing sources, most patiently studied, valued, winnowed, digested, elaborated, and arranared into compact and simple forms, easily accessible, and readily available in practice, it is not easy to point out, in the whole range of medical literature, any work by a single hand so much calculated to excite admiration of the industry and talents of the author. On every article contained in the volumes, the reader cannot fail to be struck with the writer’s most extensive learning, which has enabled him to collect knowledge from all authorities, ancient and modern, foreign and domestic ; and he will, at the same time, be no less surprised than gratified at the singular power which has arranged the whole so lucidly and in such systematic order.”—British and Foreign Medical Review. CURLING.-A PRACTICAL TREATISE ON THE DISEASES of the TESTIS, and of the Spermatic Cord and Scrotum. By T. B. Cgrling, Lecturer on Surgery, and Assistant-Surgeon to the London Hospital. Surgeon to the Jews’ Hospital, &c. Author of “ A Treatise on Tetauus.” 8vo. with Illustrations oy Bagg, 18s. cloth. “Tlie author has not only been happy in the selection of his subject, as a treatise embracing within a moderate compass all the diseases of the testis, and of the scrotum, was very much Manting, but he has executed his undertaking with praiseworthy industry and zeal, aided by a sound practical judgment. In his book he has moreover thrown much new light on the nature and treatment of the disorders of the testicle, and produced a work on those diseases, not only superior to any yet published, but which, we imagine, is not likely to be soon super- seded by a better. The volume is elegantly printed, and the woodcuts, by Bagg, are beautiful.”-British and Foreign Medical Review. DONOVAN.-A TREATISE ON CHEMISTRY. By Michael Donov.-vn, M.R.I.A. 4th Edition, fcp. 8vo.

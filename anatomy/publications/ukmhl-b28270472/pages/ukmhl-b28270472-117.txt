It is blended with that persistent cartilaginous part of the skull in the Lepidosiren; but, in the better ossified Fishes, when the osseous centres of the neura- pophyses of the cranial vertebrae begin to be established in that car- tilaginous basis, a distinct bone is likewise, in most cases, developed for the more express defence of the labyi’ihtli.' Since, however, • Itiis is regarded by some hoinologists as the body of a fifth cranial vertebra; l)iit from its relations to the nasal bone it would have better claims to be considered the s])ine of such, if there were sullicient grounds for admitting vertebral segments beyond the nasal one : and the cephalic region of the skeleton might well dider, like the cervical and other regions, in the number of its vertebral segments; but I have not found good evidence of such variation.

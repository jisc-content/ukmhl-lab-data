128 LECTURE V. There are neither pectoral nor ventral fins in the Cyclostomous Fishes. In the Plagiostomes there are both: but the scapular arch is detached from the occiput, the condition of its displacement being the more posterior position of the heart in these fishes. In the Sharks and Chim£er£e it is loosely suspended by ligaments from the vertebral column : in the Rays the point of resistance of their enormous pectoral fins has a firmer, but somewhat anomalous attachment, by the medium of the coalesced upper ends of the supra-scapular pieces to the summits of the spines of the confluent anterior portion of the thoracic abdominal vertebras. In the Sharks the scapular arch con- sists chiefly of the coracoid portions 42. 5q), which are confluent together beneath the pericardium which they support and defend; the scapular ends of the arch, connected to the coracoids by ligament, project freely upwards, backwards, and outwards. To a posterior prominence of the coracoid cartilage corresponding with the anchy- losed radius and ulna {ih. 54, 55) in the Lophius, there are attached, in the Dog-fish and most other Sharks, three sub-compressed, sub- elongated carpal cartilages, the uppermost {ih. 56) the smallest, and styliform ; it supports the upper or outer phalangeal ray. The next bone {ih. 56') is the largest and triangular, attached by its apex to the arch, and supporting by its base the majority of the phalanges. Cartilages of the pectoral fin and arch of the Dog-fish (Spinax acanlhias). The third carpal {ih. 56") is a smaller but triangular cartilage, and supports six of the lower or radial phalanges. Three joints (meta- carpal and digital) complete each cartilaginous ray or representative of the finger {ih. 57) ; and into the outer surface of the last are in- serted the fine horny rays or filaments {ih. 57"), the homologues of

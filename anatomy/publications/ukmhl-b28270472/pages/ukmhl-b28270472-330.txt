Its merits are too well acknowledged for it to be necessary to say anything further in its behalf. Wlierever toxicology is known as a science. Professor Christison’s treatise is received as ati authority of the greatest weight. Dr. Christison has himself revised the present edition; and having taken advantage, he states, of the numerous investigations which have been carried on during the last eight years in the several departments oftoxicology in the leading countries of Europe, he has found it necessary materially to change the size of the work. He has not, however, been obliged, he adds, in order to embody recent additions to our knowledge, to alter in any important degree, either the general principles formerly laid down in previous editions, or what he had previously stated as well ascertained general facts.”—Lancet.

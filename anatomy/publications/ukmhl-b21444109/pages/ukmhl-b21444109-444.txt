GENERAL ANATOMY. 422 of loss of consciousness, sensation, and motion, is not followed by loss of voluntary motion, these, I have ah'eady attempted to show, depend on that capillary injection which is removeable by the use of remedies. When the capillary injection pro- ceeds to destruction either by hemorrhage, by sof- tening, or by ulceration, i. e. by superficial pulpy destruction of cerebral substance, consequent on hemorrhage, it almost invariably leaves after it more or less loss of voluntary motion, generally on the side of the body opposite to that of the brain which has sustained the lesion. (K.) One of the most frequent effects of cerebral hemorrhage and its consequences, indeed, is palsy of the hemiplegic form ; and in the brains of such persons as have laboured under this disease, either a broken down and softened spot, or one or more hemorrhagic cavities or cysts are found after death. (Wepfer, WiUis, Morgagni, John Hunter, Baillie, Wilson, Abernethy, Rochoux, Serres, Lerminier, Tacheron, Abercrombie.) The general accuracy of these conclusions is confirmed not only by the necro- scopic appearances of the brains of those who die of coma succeeding to palsy, but of those who die of the effects of injuries of the head, of abscess of the brain and cerebellum, and of tumours and other organic changeg taking place either in the brain or in its membranes. The situation of these destroyed spots and he- morrhagic cavities, when inducing palsy, corre- sponds much with that of the cerebral injection

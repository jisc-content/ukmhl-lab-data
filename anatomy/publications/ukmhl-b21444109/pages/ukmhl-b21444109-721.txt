MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 697 spreading in general,notalways or necessarily, with ulceration, but advancing to this process when not suitably or promptly opposed, and occasionally ending in death of portions of the mucous iTiembrane. Of this inflammation the chief peculia- rities are, 1st, that it is confined with considerable accuracy to the colon or large intestine, and the ileum being but rare- ly affected, and only at its lower or colic extremity ; 2d, that this inflammatory action spreads continuously from the ileo- coecal valve along the mucous membrane of the cacum, right branch of the colon, transverse arch and sigmoid flexure, at various rates, and with various effects, but at all times with that of producing frequent copious discharges of mucous, muco-purulent, and blood-coloured stools; 3</, that this pro- cess may continue for some time without producing ulcera- tion of the mucous corion, or inflammation of the sub-mu- cous tissue; that these phenomena may take place, never- theless, in certain circumstances, at an early period; and that in others they occur towards the conclusion of the disease; and Mh, that though this inflammatory process in general commences with disoi'der of the circulation, and increased number of the cardiac pulse, it may commence without this, and almost always goes on when once established, without the pulse being much quickened, till the inflammatory process either affects the sub-mucous tissue, or, which is nearly the same thing, begins to effect mortification of the mucous tissue. The formation of numerous ulcers in the tract of the co- lon may be said to indicate the chronic form of the disorder. This, from the statements of Ballingall, Bampfield, and An- nesley, appears to be more common in the tropical variety of the disorder than in that observed in more temperate cli- mates. The same change, however, was seen by Morgagni, Lieutaud, Baillie, Cooke, and others, in the dysenteric affec- tions of the latter description. In one instance of a man of 65, who had for several weeks laboured under chronic purging, and whose body I inspected for my friend Mr Caird, I found the colic mucous membrane occupied by numerous ulcers, irregular in shape, and varying in size from the area of a split pea to that of a sixpence, and even of

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 139 branch from which the minute artery derives its blood, but is gradually acquiring the dark hue which belongs to the blood of the venous branches and trunks. By some, again, this direct communication of minute arteries and veins is denied. Thus, ac- cording to Doellinger, the arteries at their last ra- mifications are devoid of proper membranous walls; the blood moves in immediate contact with the solid matter of the body, which is in truth the fundamental or penetrating filamentous tissue; and from this it passes into the venous tubes and lymphatics, which also arise from this substance. According to Wilbrand, again, who equally de- nies this direct communication of arteries and veins, all the blood is converted into organic fibres and secretions ; and these organic fibres becoming gradually fluid are converted into blood and lymph, which continue the circulation. These notions are too fanciful and too incapa- ble of demonstration to become the object of seri- ous attention to the anatomist. It is of little mo- ment whether the vessels in the ultimate ramifi- cations possess tunics or not. When they cease to possess tunics they cease to be vessels ; and to carry observation beyond this point is either im- practicable or useless. In other respects the in- vestigation of this point belongs to the subject of the exhalant vessels. Bichat has described two great capillary sys- tems in the human body. 1*/, The general one.

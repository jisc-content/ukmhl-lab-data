254> DISTINCTION BETWEEN of the former, especially in the substance of the several textures, essentially constitutes what is termed the organization of these textures. Many anatomists have imagined that each texture has a proper matter, or parenchyma, by which it was supposed to be particularly distinguished, and which was conceived to consist of minute inorga- nic solid atoms. Whether this opinion be well founded or not, it is perhaps of little moment to inquire. At present it is certain that it is not sus- ceptible of demonstration. The phenomena of injections, in which he was eminently successful, led Ruysch to entertain the opinion, that every substance of the animal frame consisted of nothing but vessels. This idea, though opposed by Albinus * on the same grounds on which it was advanced, was nevertheless revived by William Hunter, who believed that the inorganic parts of animal bodies are too minute for sensible, or even microscopical examination. In every part, however minute, always excepting nails, hair, tooth enamel, &c. vessels could be traced ; and even a cicatrix he demonstrated is vascular to its centre.t By the aid of the microscope the researches of Lieberkuhn tended still more powerfully to fa- vour this opinion. X But repeated observation of the effects of injection in every part and tex- ture almost of the body by Barth and Prochaska has led the latter to conclude, that this opinion, understood in the ordinary mode, is not tenable. * Annotationum Academicarum, Lib. iii. + Medical Observations and Inquiries, Vol. II. t De Villis Intestinorum. t

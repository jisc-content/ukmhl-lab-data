288 GENERAL ANATOMY. or exhalation of nervous substance in the new mat- ter. * Is this, which is said to be the last stage of the process, not co-existent and simultaneous with the effusion of new matter in general ? What are the proofs which show that the proper nervous matter is last deposited ? When a nerve has been divided under circum- stances which prevent it from uniting in any man- ner with its detached segment, as in amputation, the extremity enlarges and becomes vascular, from theneurilematic vessels assuming the inflammatory action ; blood and lymph are effused both from the cut extremity and into the interstices of the neu- rilematic canals ; more or less adhesion is con- tracted with the contiguous textures ; and when the active state of this process has subsided, a hard knotty tubercle is left in the site of the cut extremity. This tubercle is at first rendered vas- cular, afterwards grayish, solid, and so firm that the knife may be blunted in dividing it. (Arne- mann.) The changes now mentioned I have often traced in the surface of stumps during healing. The size and shape of the tubercle vary according to circumstances not well ascertained. When si- tuate not exactly at the extremity, as observed by Van Horne, f it merely shows that the inflamma- tory process had spread farther up the nerve than usual. â€¢ Anat. Gen. Tom. I.

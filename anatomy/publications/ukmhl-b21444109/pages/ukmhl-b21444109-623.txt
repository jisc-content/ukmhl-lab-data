599 SKIN. the papillae either continue unchanged, or shrink less proportionally, and give rise to the appearance described under the name goose skin; (cutis anse- rina.) This surface was said by the older anato- mists to present numerous openings, orifices, or pores ; but according to Gordon, if we trust to mere observation, no openings of this kind can be recognized, either by the eye or the microscope, except those of the sebaceous follicles. The hairs, indeed, are found to issue from holes in the corion, but they fiU them up completely. In certain situations, for instance at the en- trance of the external auditory hole, at the tip of the nose, on the margins of the eyelids, in the arm-pits, at the nipple, at the skin of the pubes, round the anus, and the female pudendum, are placed minute orifices, from which exudes an olea- ginous fluid, which is quickly indurated. These openings lead into small sacs or cavities called follicles, (folliculi), or sebaceous glands, (glan- dulce sebaceae.) Of these sacs the structure is simple. They appear to consist simply of hoUow surfaces secreting an oleaginous fluid, which is pro- gressively propelled to the orifice, where it soon undergoes that partial inspissation which gives it the sebaceous or suet-like aspect and consistence. The corion is liberally supplied with blood- vessels, nerves, and absorbents. After a success- ful injection, its outer surface appears to consist of a uniform net-work of minute vessels, subdivided to an infinite degree of delicacy, and containing during life blood coloured and colourless. It can

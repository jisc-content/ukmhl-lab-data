GENEKAL ANATOMY. 600 scarcely be doubted that this vascular net-work (rete vasmilosum) is the only texture correspond- ing to the reticular body of the older anatomists. It is well known that this membrane when boiled sufficiently long is converted into a viscid glutinous liquor, which consists chiefly of gela- tin, (Chaptal, Seguin, Hatchett, Vauquelin, &c.) and that glue is obtained in great quantity from it for the purposes of art. As, however, in these operations a portion of matter is left undissolved, and as glue is completely soluble in water, while skin resists it for an indefinite time, it may be concluded, that though the chief constituent of the corion is gelatin, it is under some peculiar modi- fication not perfectly understood. The union of this organized gelatin with the vegetable principle denominated tannin forms leather, which is quite insoluble in water. Cuticle or scarf-skin (epidermis, cuticula), is a semitransparent, or rather translucent layer of thin light-coloured matter, extended continuously over the outer surface of the corion. Its thick- ness varies, being thinnest on those parts least ex- posed to pressure and friction, but thickest in the palms and soles. It is destitute of blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents ; and there is reason to believe, from observing the phenomena and pro- cess of its reproduction, that it is originally se- creted in the form of a semifluid viscid matter by the outer surface of the corion ; and that, as it is successively worn or removed by attrition, it is in like manner repaired by a constant process of

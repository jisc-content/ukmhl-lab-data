LYMPHATIC GLAND OR GANGLION. 251 invich changed as not to be distinguished from vas- cular sarcoma. A tumour of this kind, when di- vided, presents a firm homogeneous substance of a bhiish-gray colour, somewhat elastic and com- pressible, traversed with more or fewer vessels, which may be injected from the neighbouring ar- teries, and consisting in its intimate structure of amorphous gi-anular masses united by dense fila- mentous tissue. The great hardness, and the ma- lignant tendency of this growth, have procured for it from most authors the ominous names of scirr- hus and cancer. Though correct enough for all practical purposes, these epithets are not justified by the anatomical characters. Sarcomatous enlargement may occur in any of the lymphatic glands. It is frequent in those of the neck, and may often be traced to strumous in- flammation, or to the irritation of spoilt teeth. Cruickshank mentions an instance in which the tracheo-bronchial lymphatic glands were affected with this morbid change to such extent as to cause fatal suffocation. * In the internal iliac glands it is not uncommon, so as to form large indurated masses ; and in the female may operate as a cause of difficult parturition equally fatal to the mother and the infant. (Hunter apud Cruickshank.) f The same disease occurs in the mesentery either primarily, or in consequence of ulceration of the intestines. 5. Ossification, Calcareous Deposition.

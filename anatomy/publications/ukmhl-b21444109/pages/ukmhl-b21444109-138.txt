116 GENERAL ANATOMY. liver, kidneys, spleen, &c. but is also very remark- ably observed with regard to the venous canals of the brain. I have already noticed the absence of the cellular and proper tissues in these tubes ; and I have now to remark, that the cerebral veins con- sist solely of the inner membrane, while in the brain or membranes, and when in the sinuses of this inner membrane, placed between folds of the dura mater. When the jugular vein reaches the temporo-occipital sinuosity, it loses its proper membrane, while its common or inner membrane passes into the hollow of the dura mater, call- ed sinus, and thus forms the venous canal. This fact is readily demonstrated by slitting open either the lateral or the superior longitudinal sinus, when a thin delicate membrane, quite distinct from the fibrous appearance of the dura mater, will be found to line the interior of these canals. The inner surface of many veins presents mem- branous folds projecting obhquely into the cavity of the vessel. These folds, which, from their me- chanical office, have been named valves, {valvulte,) are parabolic in shape, have two margins,â€”an at- tached and free, and two surfaces, a concave turn- ed to the cardiac end of the vein, and a convex turned in the opposite direction. The attached margin is not straight, as may be imagined, but circular, and adheres to the inner surface of the vessel. The free margin resembles in shape an oblong parabola ; and the direction of the valve is such, that a force applied to its convex surface would urge it more closely to the vein, whereas

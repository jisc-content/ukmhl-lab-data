99 ARTEllY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. stance which seems to have led Scarpa to con- sider these depositions as the same, is, that some- times in the centre of a steatomatous patch is found a broad scale of hard substance, not so firm as bone, and not so crystalline or gritty as the genuine calcareous deposition. It is generally so soft as to be flexible, and resembles rather a firm piece of cartilage than true bone. Scarpa represents the steatomatous state as pro- ceeding invariably to ulceration. This, however, is not a uniform result. A large portion of an artery may be affected with it without suffering the smallest breach of continuity or destruction of tissue. It simply distends the vessel mechani- cally ; and if unaccompanied with calcareous de- position, this distension may be considerable with- out any ulceration or laceration. In this manner probably are produced those simple dilatations of arteries which by many of the French authors are regarded as aneurism. In other instances, more especially when the steatomatous is combined with the calcareous deposition, or when the arterial tunics have been long and much distended, ulcera- tion may take place and terminate in partial or entire destruction and rupture of the arterial tu- nics. In general, this destruction takes place in the transverse direction, (Hodgson,) and the la- ceration or fissure is therefore across the tube. In such circumstances, if the aperture is not large enough to cause fatal hemorrhage, aneurism first by dilatation, and ultimately by rupture, is the consequence.

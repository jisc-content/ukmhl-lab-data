This cavity, which is larger in young or newly formed teeth, and small in those which are old, contains a delicate vascular membrane, which has been named the pulp of the tooth. It is best seen by breaking a recent tooth by a smart blow with a hammer, when the soft pulpy membrane may be picked out of the fragments by the forceps. It then appears to be a membranous web with two surfaces, an exterior adhering to the bony surface of the dental cavity by minute vessels ; the other interior, free, and, so far as can be determined of a body so minute, resembling a closed sac. The developement and growth of the teeth is a process of much interest. At what time the first rudiments of teeth ap- pear seems not to be determined with accuracy. In a fcetus before me, between the seventh and eighth month, I can merely distinguish in the centre of the vascular membrane of the alveolar cavity a minute firm body like a seed. I have, however, seen the crowns of teeth formed in foe- tuses, which I have reason to believe had not at- tained the seventh month. But whatever may be the exact period, the process is nearly as follows. As the bones of the upper and lower jaw are in the process of formation between the third and fifth months, * cavities at their lower and upper margins are gradually formed by the growth of the osseous plates, which afterwards form the * Fourth and Fifth, Bichat, p. 93, Tome iii.

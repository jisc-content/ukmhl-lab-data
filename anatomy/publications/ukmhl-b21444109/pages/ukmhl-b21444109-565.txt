543 BONE. while still cartilaginous, as penetrated by canals or tubes, which gradually disappear as ossification proceeds. The carpal and tarsal bones appear to observe the same course in the process of ossifi- cation. In the bones of the skull, however, a different law is observed. The osseous matter is originally deposited in linear tracts or fibres, radiating or diverging from certain points termed points of os- sification. Each bone is completed in one shell without diploe or distinguishable table. After- wards, when they are completed laterally, or in the radiating direction, the cancellated arrange- ment of the diploe begins to take place apparently in the same manner in which the medullary cavity and compact parts of the long bones are formed. It has been generally supposed that the forma- tion of cartilage is a preliminary step to that of bone. This, however, seems to be a mistake, arising from the circumstance that cartilage is often observed to be converted in the living body into bone. Neither in the long nor in the flat bones is any thing like cartilage at any time ob- served. The epiphyses, indeed, present something of the consistence of cartilage, but it has neither the firmness nor the elasticity of that substance. It is a concrete jelly, afterwards to be penetrated by calcareous matter. The flat bones are from the first osseous; and though their margins are soft and flexible, in consequence of their recent formation and moist state, they have still a dis-

232 GENERAL ANATOMY. a vein. According to Cruickshank there is con- siderable variety in the distribution of valves ; but in general a pair of valves will be found at every one-twentieth of an inch in lymphatics of middling size. In the larger lymphatics they are less numerous than in the small. The structure of these valvular folds is as little known as that of the inner membrane, of which they appear to be prolongations. According to Mascagni they sometimes contain a small portion of fine adipose substance. The tissue which forms the lymphatic tubes is strong, dense, and resisting; and from the weight of mercury which they bear without rupture, it has been generally concluded that they are strong- er in proportion to their size than veins. This tissue also possesses considerable elasticity. The opposite states of lymphatics during di- gestion and after long fasting, and the phenomena of mercurial injections, prove that the tissue of which they consist is distensible and contractile. Though it does not exhibit appearances of mus- cular structure, it has been long supposed to be endowed with a property analogous to irritability. Such is the inference which Hunter, Hewson, Cruickshank, and others have derived from vari- ous phenomena in the living and recently dead tissue. Though Bichat doubted what he termed organic sensible contractility, yet he admitted the insen- sible contractility as necessary to the functions

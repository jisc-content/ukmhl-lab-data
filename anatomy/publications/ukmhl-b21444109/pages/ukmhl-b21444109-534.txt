GENERAL ANATOMY. 512 a. Desmodia.â€”Inflammation of ligament may be spontaneous or the result of injury. In the for- mer case it is generally chronic, and is attended with much thickening of the desmoid tissue. The morbid action spreads to the synovial membrane on the one side., causing it to thicken and effuse morbid fluid, and on the other, to the peridesmoid cellular tissue, which is then infiltrated with jelly- like fluid, and becomes separated and somewhat indurated and granular. These changes take place in those forms of articular disease commonly known under the vague name of wJiite swelling; {tumor albus; fungus articuli; der Gliedschwamm.) Af- ter some time this morbid state of the extra-articu- lar cellular tissue may proceed to suppuration, but without necessarily opening the cavity of the joint. The capsular ligament, however, and even the fu- nicular ones, may be so much changed in struc- ture as to become unfit for their functions. Though the progress now described is that which takes place in inflammation of ligament when primary, it is necessary to mention, never- theless, that inflammation in these tissues is much more frequently the consequence of previous dis- ease in the synovial membrane or the articular cartilages. This is particularly the case in the knee-joint and elbow. |3. Ulceration of ligament is the result either of traumatic inflammation proceeding to suppuration, or of suppuration within the articular cavity. Even in the latter case the desmoid tissue itself is rarely destroyed ; and the opening takes place be-

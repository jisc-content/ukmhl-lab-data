SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 179 of venous congestion, however, unless as an effect of that in the capillary vessels, there is neither proof nor probability. It is not a primary but a secondary, or rather remote consequence. (Marsh.) 7. Hemorrhage. In all cases of hemorrhage, whether by rupture or by exhalation, the capil- laries are unusually loaded with blood. This is established by the appearance of the brain in apoplexy, of the lungs in hemoptysis, (pulmonary apoplexy of Laennec, pneumonorrhagia of Frank and Latour,) of the prostate gland in chronic en- largement, (Home,) and the state of the mucous surfaces in general. In the two first cases, espe- cially in that of the lungs, the pulmonic capillaries are large, numerous, and distended with blood, the pulmonic tissue more or less injected and firm, and blood is found oozing from the surface of the bronchial membrane. (Stark and Laennec.) 8. Excess of Nutrition. (Hypertrophia.) Hy- pertrophic augmentation. That every unusual increase in the size of parts is to be ascribed to the agency of the capillaries is well established by the phenomena of morbid enlargements and preternatural growths. Every instance of un- usual or anormal size is of three kinds. a. A texture or organ becomes enlarged in con- sequence of a uniform increase of its proper organic substance. Thus the heart becomes thicker, firmer, and larger in all its dimensions. Its muscular substance, and perhaps the intermuscular filamen- tous tissue, are actually augmented. They are redder, firmer, and contain more blood than na-

184 GENERAL ANATOMY. mellar tissues, still little known in their structure, in which the blood appears often to stagnate in- stead of moving. As this peculiar structiu'e was known in the cavernous body to be the seat of a motion long knoM^n by the name of erecfiofi, MM. Dupuytren and Richerand distinguished this ar- rangement of arteries and veins as a peculiar tis- sue, under the name of erectile,â€”a distinction which, though partly understood before, has only now been admitted as well-founded in the writings of anatomical authors. According to the recent arrangements of M. Beclard this tissue compre- hends not only the structure of the cavernous bo- dy, but that of the spongy substance, (corpus spoti- giosum,) which encloses the urethra, and forms its two extremities, the bulb and gland, the clitoris, the nymphce, and the nipple of the female, the structure of the spleen in both sexes, and even that of the lips. * It is somewhat unfortimate that the researches of anatomists on this erectile tissue have been re- stricted chiefly to the spongy body of the m-ethra and the cavernous body of the penis ; and it is ra- ther by analogy than very direct proof, that simi- larity of structure between them and the other parts referred to the same head is maintained. I shall state here what is most satisfactorily known on the subject. * Additions a rAnatoniie Generale de Xav. Bichat, par P. A. Beclard, p. 118.

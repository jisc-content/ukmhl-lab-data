GENERAL ANATOMY. 488 muscular filament appears to consist of a series of globular or oblong spheriodal atoms, disposed in a linear direction, and connected by a transparent elastic jelly-like matter. * The primary muscular fibres are placed close and parallel to each other, and are united in every species of muscle into bundles (fasciculi, lacerti,) of different, but determinate size ; and, according as these bundles are large or small, the appear- ance of the muscle is coarse or delicate. In the deltoid the bundles are the largest. In the vasti glutaei and large pectoral muscles the bundles are greatly larger than in the jisoce. In the muscles of the face, of the ball of the eye, of the hyoid bone, and especially in those of the peri- nseum, these bundles are very minute, and almost incapable of being distinguished. The number of ultimate filaments which compose a bundle varies in different muscles, and probably in different animals. In a muscular fibre of moderate size in the human subject, Prochaska estimates them to vary from 100 to 2100 ; and in animals with larger fibres at double, triple, or even four times that number, f There is reason to conclude, from correct microscopic observation, that the largest * The Croonian Lecture.

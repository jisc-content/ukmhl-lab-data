GENERAL ANATOMY, 128 a%ygos between the superior and inferior cavce. The azygos itself is connected at its upper or bron- chial extremity with the superior cava, and at its lower extremity it is in some subjects connected directly with the inferior cava, in others by means of the right renal vein, and in most by the first lumbar veins. By means of the demianygos, again, it is connected with the left renal vein, or the lumbars of the same side, and in some instan- ces directly with the inferior cava. To the azy- gos and demiazygos, therefore, belongs the re- markable property of connecting not only the ve- nous canals of the upper and lower divisions, but those of the right and left halves of the body. Section II. Venous tissue is liable to inflammation, adhe- sive or circumscribed, and spreading,â€”generally suppurative, to varix, to osseous deposition, and to the formation of concretions. 1. Inflammation. {Phlebitis.) Of circumscribed or adhesive inflammation of veins, a good example is found in the ordinary union after incised wounds as in venesection. In this case the lips of the wound, if accurately applied to each other, adhere sometimes directly by inosculation, in other in- stances by effusion of lymph, which becomes or- ganized. 2. Spreading inflammation of venous tissue is a

289 NEEVOUS TISSUE. It was at one time supposed that the morbid growth called hlood-like fungus (fungus hcemato- des) was peculiar to the nervous tissue. This idea is now known to be incorrect; and it appears that there is no process of disorganization peculiar to nerve, and not occurring in other textures. Nervous texture is sometimes unnaturally soft; as in dropsy, fatal hemorrhages, and diseases of long wasting. (Autenrieth.) Is it ever unusually soft primarily, and without being the result of another disease ? It undergoes raoUescence (m- moUissement) in consequence of mechanical in- jury ; but it is exceedingly doubtful if this takes place spontaneously. 4. Local forms of palsy, that is, loss of mobility in an order of muscles, or in a limb, is a common result of injury done to a nerve or nerves. The effect of such injury is in general to produce in- flammation or extravasation, and subsequent de- struction of the proper nervous matter. It be- <3omes soft, pulpy, and disorganized. In this state the nerve is no longer fit to perform its usual functions, and it loses the influence which it pos- sessed over the muscles to which it is distributed. In the course of this process irregular motions, or what are termed spasms, not imfrequently occur. Tetanus. Punctured or lacerated wounds of nervous tissue may be followed by tonic spasms, {tetanus,) or by convulsive motions in general. It is imcertain in this case whether the irregular mo- T

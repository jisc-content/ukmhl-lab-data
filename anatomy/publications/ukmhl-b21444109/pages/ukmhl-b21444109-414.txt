392 GENERAL ANATOMY. part.) * For example, several weeks or months after a blow on the upper or fore part of the head, from which the patient never perfectly re- covers, but is more or less paralytic, perhaps oc- casionally lethargic, deaf, blind, or fatuous, death takes place, and an abscess is found in the sub- stance of the hemispheres, in the corpus striatum^ or even in one of the lobes of the cerebellum. 3d, In some instances of suppuration after injuryj the collection does not take place at the part at which the blow struck the skull, but either in the line of the force passing through the brain, or in some of the lines into which this force may be re- solved. 4tth, It is chiefly when the force has been directly expended on the part, i. e. when the bone has been immediately broken, and its mem- branes injured, that suppuration takes place on the surface of the brain. This suppuration is then the result rather of the affection of the mem- branes, especially of the pia mater, than of the cerebral substance itself. Suppuration may take place in any part of the brain; but it is most frequent in the hemispheres. The effects which it produces vary according to the situation and the extent of the purulent col- lection. They are much the same as from the presence of blood, tumours, or other unusual sub- stances. * Memoire sur les contre coups dans les lesions de la tete. Par M. Chopart.

VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 113 tainly filaments or fibres may be recognized. But, instead of being longitudinal, they may be made to assume any direction, according to the manner in which the filamentous tissue is removed. For this reason probably these fibres are to be viewed as part of the filamentous sheath. In the saphe- na vein of the leg oblique fibres may be seen de- cussating each other ; but it is doubtful whether these belong to the proper venous tissue, or to the filamentous covering. The nature of this proper membrane or venous fibre, as it is sometimes named, (Bichat,) is not at all known. Its great extensibility, its softness, its want of elasticity in the circular direction, or fra- gility, its colour and general aspect, distinguish it from the arterial tunic. It possesses some elasti- city in the longitudinal direction, and is retracted vigorously when stretched. It possesses consider- able resistance, or in common language is tough. The experiments of Clifton Wintringham show that it sustains a considerable weight without breaking, and that this toughness is greater in early life, or in the veins of the young subject, than at a later period. * In short, it may be stated as a general fact, that venous tissue, though thin- ner, possesses greater elasticity and tenacity than arterial tissue. According to the experiments of the same inquirer this property depends on that of the superior density of the venous tissue, the * Experimental Inquiry on some parts of the Animal Struc- ture.

305 BRAIN. from the curvilinear hollow to the posterior tip of the hemisphere, it affords no mark, line, or boun- dary, on which to establish this popular and much used division ; and the whole presents a uniform region of convolutions, which resemble in every respect those found on other parts of this surface. The whole region, therefore, ought in truth to be viewed as a single division of the convoluted sur- face ; but as its posterior part rests not on the cranium, but on the horizontal portion of the hard membrane which covers the small brain, while the division of lobes must be discarded as artificial, it may be expedient to subdivide the surface into two, the medio-inferior and postero-inferior re- gions of the convoluted surface, according as they correspond to different containing parts. The first, which near the curvilinear hollow is slightly convex or rounded, is lodged in a considerable cavity of the cranium, formed by the sphenoid and temporal bones, bounded before by the spheno-frontal arch, and behind by the pyra- mid or petrous portion of the temporal bone. This part of the convoluted surface, which may be also named the spheno-temporal, is one of con- siderable importance, and should be accurately known by the anatomical student. The posterior division of this region, which is plane, corresponds to the horizontal or cerebellic part of the hard membrane, and, though not to be distinguished by any minute or organic limit, may, u

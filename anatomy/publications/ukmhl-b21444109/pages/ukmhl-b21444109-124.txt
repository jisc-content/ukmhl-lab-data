GENERAL AN ATOM VT. 104 mon in the temporal artery when that vessel has been opened to discharge blood for affections of the head. It may, however, succeed punctured wounds, especially sword-thrusts in any part of the body. In short, every cause which partially wounds or injures the side of an artery, as a sharp spicula of bone, may be follov/ed by false aneu- rism. At the bend of the arm it is to be distin- guished from aneurismal varix and varicose aneu- rism. When an artery is entirely divided across, the result varies according to the size of the vessel. The moment the division is completed, a copious gush of blood issues from the vessel, the divided portions mutually recede with more or less force, and the waUs of the vessel collapse so as to con- tract its area uniformly from the circumference to the centre. Of the two latter actions the former is limited by the attachment of the proper arterial tissue to the filamentous sheath. But notwith- standing this limitation, so forcible is the retrac- tion, as it is termed, that the connecting fibres of the filamentous sheath are always rent for some small space from the cut ends of the tube. The annular contraction, or central diminution of the area, is also counteracted by the longitudinal im- pulse of the blood ; and in large vessels this resist- ance to the central contraction is so great, that the latter has little or no sensible influence in suppres- sing hemorrhage. In such circumstances the chief agents of this process are the pressure of coagu-

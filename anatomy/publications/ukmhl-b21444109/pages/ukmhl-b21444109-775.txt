751 SEROUS MEMBRANE. Gordon, who could not recognize such tissue. The difference, however, consists merely in name. The pia mater, indeed, possesses no cellular tis- sue like the subcutaneous, the submucous, or the subserous. If, however, a portion of the arachnoid be peeled from it by careful management of the forceps and blowpipe, there is found a quantity of loose filamentous or flocculent matter, which evi- dently unites, this tissue to the finer web of the former. It is further remarkable that Dr Gordon himself admits that the inner surface (he should have said the outer or attached,) of the arachnoid membrane is more or less thready orflocculerit, ac- cording to its connection with thejom mater, with- out seeming to be aware that this thready ap- pearance is occasioned by filamentous tissue. Last- ly, the existence of this tissue between the pia mater and arachnoid is unequivocally demonstrat- ed by the phenomena of serous infiltration. The distribution and configuration of the pia mater is peculiar ; and correct knowledge of these is requisite in order to understand its pathological relations. The pia mater, or proper membrane of the brain, consists of two parts, an outer, co- vering the convoluted surface of the brain, and an inner or central, entering the cavities formed by the inner, central, or figurate surface, and spread over this surface in the form of what has been termed the vascular or choroid web; (plexus choroides; tela choroidea.)

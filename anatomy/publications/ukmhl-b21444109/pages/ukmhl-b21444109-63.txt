FILAMENTOUS Oil CELLULAR TISSUE. 43 brain and its functions are conspicuous characters. Death generally takes place before any of the tis- sues are mortified, in consequence of the violence of the constitutional symptoms, chiefly the affec- tion of the brain. 3. hiflammation of a chronic nature is not un- common in the filamentous tissue. In the ordi- nary acute form, the process is attended with more or less pain and swelling, and proceeds quickly to suppuration. In other circumstances, however, little or no pain is felt; swelling is not perceived till late ; and the first intimation of the existence of the disease is a collection of purulent matter, which, when discharged, is not homogeneous, but consists of flaky or curd-like shreds floating in a thinnish watery fluid. This constitutes the cold abscess {apostema fr 'igidum) of the surgeons of the Saracen school, and is the chronic abscess of mo- dern surgeons. (Boyer.) The cold abscess may be formed in any part of filamentous tissue ; but it is most frequent where this tissue is loose and abimdant. Seldom seen in the head, it is frequent in the neck, in the chest, in the back, especially in the lumbar region, and in the extremities. I have seen this tumour most generally in the loins, where it is liable to be con- founded with lumbar abscess; in the cellular tissue of the glutcBi muscles ; and in the thigh and leg, especially the posterior and internal region. In these situations it is not unfrequently the cause of sinuous cavities, which are difficult to be healed.

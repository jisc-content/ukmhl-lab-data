GENERAL ANATOMY, 470 tinguished from the surrounding cerebral sub- stance by its firmness, sometimes a lobulated structure, by its interior substance consisting of a proportion more or less considerable of yellow- ish matter as hard as cartilage, arranged sometim,es in streaks or bands, in other cases in round no- dules, constitutes the principal characters of this morbid growth in its crude or early stage. At a more advanced period cavities begin to be form- ed, in which is contained a fluid or semifluid mat- ter sometimes jelly-like, at other times thinner, and occasionally tinged with blood. Before this process of softening has advanced far death takes place in general by suspension of the functions of the organ. The cartilaginous tumour may be deposited in a tubercular form, and perhaps consisting partly of tubercular or albuminous matter. Of this a good instance is given by Bayle in his Treatise on Pulmonary Consumption. A printer of 58, with complete paraplegy, and obliteration of the intel- lect almost to idiocy, followed by weakness of the arms and sudden loss of speech, died with lethargy and paralytic dyspnoea. In the anterior part of the right hemisphere was a tubercular and can- cerous mass the size of a turkey's egg, nearly spherical, and of considerable consistence and spe- cific gravity. With a reddish-gray surface irre- gularly knobbed, traversed by blood-vessels, it consisted internally of a canary-yellow, thick, gra- nular, pasty matter, void of vessel or trace of or-

GENERAL ANATOMY. 736 examples are now recorded; the fistula which result from the ulceration caused by the discharge of gall-stones ; arti- ficial anus so frequent after intestinal inflammation, and especially that which attends strangulated hernia; urinary fistulae, whether taking place from the bladder in the hypo- gastrium or rectum, or from the urethra; and destruction of the recto-vaginal septum in females, either by laceration or ulceration. These fistulae are covered by a smooth callous membrane so similar in its properties to mucous texture that John Hunter, Meckel, and some other authors think it not an extravagant or gratuitous hypothesis to regard them as examples of the anormal developement of mucous texture. CHAPTER XXIII. Section I. Serous Membrane, Transparent Mem- brane ;—Memhrana pellucida,—M. serosa; —Tissu Sereux. The pleura and peritonaeum are the best ex- amples of the tissue, which has been named se- rous, from the fluid with which it is moistened, and which may be termed transparent or diapha- nous as its distinctive character. The distribution or mechanical arrangement of these membranes is peculiar, and though not well understood by anatomists till Douglas, by his description of the peritonaeum, rendered it clear- er, may now be said by the labours of Hunter, Carmichael Smyth, and Bichat, to be quite intel- ligible. In this, nevertheless, there are certain pe- culiarities which may perplex the beginner, and prevent hira from obtaining at first a clear idea

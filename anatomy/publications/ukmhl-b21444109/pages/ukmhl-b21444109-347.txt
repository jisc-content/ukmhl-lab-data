BRAIN. 325 each side of the hollow will be found to be very deep, and the eminences proportionally high from the more solid part of the encephalic organ; and the hollow itself will appear almost like the fur- row of a convolution on a large scale. Its pecu- liarity indeed is, that the bottom of the hollow is not convoluted, but presents an extensive uniform space of grayish cerebral matter, on each side of which, but especially behind, the convolutions are very large and distinct. This convoluted part begins insensibly at the outer or lateral edge of the hemisphere, where it is narrow; becomes broader as it advances forwards and inwards; and about one inch from the mesial plane, is par- ticularly distinct, broader, and more spacious than at any other part of its course. It here presents an infinity of holes or orifices of various size in the cerebral substance, not ar- ranged in any regular order, but uniformly found in this situation. Some of these orifices are suf- ficiently large to admit the point of a small silver probe ; but the greater number are more minute, and do not exceed the calibre of a common-sized bristle. The space over which they extend is various, and its figure cannot be accurately de- fined ; it is generally equivalent to the half of a square inch. In numerous dissections, I have found it uniformly at this part, and of this size, as nearly as it is possible to estimate, in measure- ment of objects so variable as those of the organs of the animal body. I have not been able to re-

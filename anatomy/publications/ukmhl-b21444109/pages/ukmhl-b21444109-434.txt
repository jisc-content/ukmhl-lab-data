GENERAL ANATOMY. 412 degrees of lethargic or comatose affection. The inquiry is beset by this difficulty, that not the extravasation, but the injection, is the essential cause of death. Scarcely a part of the brain has been found unaffected in fatal cases. It is certain that effusion into the white matter of the hemi- spheres, and into the striated nucleus, is not es- sentially and invariably fatal; for from cases of this kind temporary recovery has taken place. Neither is the inference of Bichat, that effusion into the protuberance is invariably fatal, well- founded. Tacheron records a case in which tem- porary recovery was effected. It must be admit- ted, nevertheless, that effusion into this part is more likely to be fatal than into any other. The cases of Serres afford the explanation of this fact, by showing, that injury done to the protuberance causes a severe and permanent lesion of the func- tion of the lungs, the vessels of which become dis- tended with unrespired blood, while the air-vesicles are ruptured, and death is effected by asphyxia. The state of the cerebral vessels which termi- nates in hemorrhage may occur, perhaps, at any period of adult life. But these blood-vessels are liable to a peculiar state which predisposes to ex- travasation. This consists in deposition of earthy matter between the coats of the internal carotid ar- teries, and of the basilar artery and their branches. In consequence of this deposition, they lose part of their contractile and distensile powers, and some of their tenacity; and whenever blood is acciimu-

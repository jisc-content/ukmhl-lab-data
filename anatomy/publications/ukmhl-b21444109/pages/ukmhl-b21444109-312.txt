290 GENERAL ANATOMY. tions depend on injury of the nerve, or its neuri- lematic sheath. 5. Tumours, {Neuroma of Odier.) Tumours of various size and structure have been found in ner- vous trunks. These may be either common to nerve with other tissues, or proper. * Of the for- mer an example is given in the encysted tumour {hygroma) which Cheselden | found in the centre of the cubital {ulnar) nerve. Of that met with by Gooch in the axillary nerve, the account is not so distinct. X Sir Everard Home mentions a tu- mour removed from the middle of the right arm by John Hunter, and in which the musculo-cu- taneous nerve was found imbedded, divided into two portions, each much flattened. ^ This tu- • It is singular to remark with how little precision patho- logical writers speak of these tumours. Odier compares the one mentioned by Cheselden to a firm one noticed by Gooch, and to the yellow-whitish tumour which he met in the radial nerve of a relative. Meckel also refers to Cheselden's case in speaking of tumours, considerably hard, roundish, yellow- whitish, of fibrous structure, and approaching to fibro-carti- lage. The case of Cheselden should have been carefully dis- tinguished from the tumours intended to exemplify this de- scription. For that surgeon states specifically, that " it was of the cistic kind, but contained a transparent jelly." It was in truth an instance of hygroma, and, as I have stated in the text, it was common to the nervous and other tissues. •{■ The Anatomy of the Human Body, p. 256. London, 1778.

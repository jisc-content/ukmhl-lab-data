6;^ GENERAL ANATOMY. and perfect form. (A.) In conclusion, all that can be affirmed regarding the formation of this substance is, that it is deposited by the blood-vessels, but by what particular process, or in what form, is en- tirely unknown. The process by which the arte- ries of the adipose membrane secrete fat appears to be equally mysterious as that by which the ves- sels of muscle deposit fibrine, those of bone de- posit osseous matter, and those of cartilage form that animal substance. Section II. The pathological relations of the adipose tis- sue have not been distinctly indicated. 1. Is it subject to inflammation ? I have already said that certain facts would lead to the inference, that the peculiar phenomena of diffuse inflammation may depend on the influence of the adipose mem- brane. At present, however, this is little more than conjectural. Meanwhile, it may be remarked, that the adipose cushion with which the blood-vessels are surrounded is sometimes the seat of a bad in- flammatory action, terminating in fetid and sloughy suppuration. I have seen also an example of in- flammation of the adipose cushion of the kidney, in which the whole of this substance was convert- ed into an ash-coloured, fetid, semifluid pulp, mix- ed with shreddy filaments, and in which the sloughing process had opened a passage from the fat of the left kidney into the interior of the arch of the colon.

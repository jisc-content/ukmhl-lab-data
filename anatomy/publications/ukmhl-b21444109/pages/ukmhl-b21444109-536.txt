514 GENE 11AI, ANATOMY. periosteal inflammation in these bones.* The ap- pearances produced in the bones by this process belong to another head. Though any part of the periosteum may be attacked by inflammation, certain regions seem more liable to it than others. Node, whether from strumous, syphilitic, or mer- curial origin, generally takes place in parts of the periosteum where that membrane approaches the surface. Thus the anterior surface of the tibia, the posterior internal surface of the ulna, the outer surface of the radius, and the anterior surface of the clavicle and sternum, are usual situations for periosteal inflammation. Strumous periosteal in- flammation in the phalanges of the fingers I have seen only in young children. The phalanges are then rough and denuded ; and the discharge of fetid sanious matter gives rise to sinuous ulcers not easily healed. These effects are to be attri- buted to the suspension of the nutritious powers of the periosteal vessels. (See p. 535.) In some instances inflammation of the perios- teum terminates in a bony swelling, or a deposi- tion of hard osseous matter on the surface of the bone. (Exostosis.) The exact nature of the process is not well understood. But there is rea- son to believe, that what is originally a deposit of lymph, as in node, becomes eventually penetrated by calcareous matter, (Med.-Ch.Tr.

NERVOUS TISSUE. 259 ture of the nerves ; that the works of Reil, * Bi- chat, and Gordon, contain the most accurate in- formation on the nervous chords in general; and that the treatises of Scarpa f and Wutzer ^ con- tain the most satisfactory information on the ar- rangement of those parts named ganglions and plexus. Each nerve forms connections in three different ways; 1st, A nerve must be connected to some part of the central mass by one of its extremities, —the cerebral or spinal end ; 2d, It must be con- nected to some texture or organ, or part of an organ by the other extremity,—the organic end; and, 3d, It may be connected to other nerves by a species of junction called anastomosis, (ansa)— anastomosing or uniting point. By means of the two first connections, it is supposed to maintain a communication between the central mass and the several organs ; and by the latter it is understood to be subservient to a more general and extensive intercourse, which is believed to be necessary in various functions and actions of the animal system. Every nerve consists essentially of two parts ; one exterior, protecting, and containing; the * J. C. Reil, Exercitationes Anatomlcae de Structura Ner- vorum.

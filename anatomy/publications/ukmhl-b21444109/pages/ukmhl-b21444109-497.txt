475 BRAIN. covered here by part of the choroid web, is placed invariably an irregular-shaped mass, varying in size from that of a small pin-head to a grain of hemp-seed. When seized by the forceps this is found to grate like sand or grains of stone; and when examined it actually consists of minute gra- nules aggregated together by membranous fila- ments of animal matter. This irregular-shaped sandy mass is what is termed by Soemmering acer- vulus conarii. The granules in the centre are gene- rally larger than those at the surface; and its irre- gular shape depends on the number and size of the small superficial granules. They are generally yel- low or citron-coloured, hard, rough, semitranspa- rent, and distinctly grating on a steel instrument. Besides the situation now mentioned,—the union of the peduncles,—sandy particles are occasionally found anterior to the peduncles close on the basis of the gland, or disseminated in its substance. In infants before the 7th year, it is never found in the substance of the conarium, but generally in the plate which connects it to the thalami. The most ordinary place for it in adults is the pit between the conarium and its penduncles ; and in aged sub- jects it may be found in all the three situations. It has been found in natives of every European nation almost, and in Africans. According to the analysis of MviUer these stones contain calcareous earth; and from some experi- ments of Munch it appears that the lime is united with oxalic acid. Whatever be the quantity of this deposition, it

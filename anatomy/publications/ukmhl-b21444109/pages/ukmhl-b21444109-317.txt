295 NERVOUS TISSUE. The proofs, in short, which may be adduced in favour of this idea are the following. 1. In many- instances of subcutaneous tubercle the lenticular body has been formed in the substance or coat of a nerve. (Camper, Bisset, A. Petit, Tissot, Lassus, Jacopi, &c.) 2. In the majority of cases the tu- bercle can be traced distinctly to the branch, twig, or filament of a subcutaneous nerve. 3. The pain- ful sensation of which it is the seat, though se- vere and constant, is always aggravated by hand- ling or pressing the tumour, and may be always traced along nervous branches. In the cases in which the neuromatic tubercle has been dissected, it has been found hard, carti- laginous, and slightly vascular. It seems in ge- neral to consist in morbid change of the neurilema, by deposition of albuminous matter in the neuri- lematic interstices. (Jacopi.) It is much more frequent in women than in men, in the proportion nearly of from seven to one, and from ten to one. Monteggia states that he found the entire nervous system occupied with numerous (centinaia) neu- romatic tubercles, which would indicate, as he ob- serves, in some instances a neuromatic diathesis. * The cause of their formation is not known ; but from the effects of ligature, division, and other injury, it may be in some manner conceived. 7. Considerable wasting and shrinking were seen in the optic nerves by Spigelius, Riolan, Rolfinck, * Istituzione Chirurgiche, Vol. II. p. lg7.

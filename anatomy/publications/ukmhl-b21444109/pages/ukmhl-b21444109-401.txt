Its occurrence in the spinal chord, in which the same series of changes takes place, has been described by M. Pinel the younger, * M. Olivier, f and M. Velpeau. \ What is the intimate nature of this disease, and wherein does it differ from suppuration of the or- gan ? This question must be determined by con- sidering the anatomical characters of the lesion, and the circumstances under which it takes place. In the part affected, the portion of brain is never entirely removed. The cerebral substance is se- parated, broken down, and mixed either with se- rous, with bloody, or with purulent fluid. It may succeed at least four morbid states of the organ. 1. It may be the consequence of the blood-stroke, {cowp de sang,) or injection of the vessels of a given region of the organ. The soft- ened part is then reddish, rose-coloured, ama- ranth, crimson, or brown. 2. It may follow the effusion of red blood, which nearly in the same manner separates and breaks down the delicate * Sur rinflammation de la Moelle Epiniere. By M. Pinel Fils.

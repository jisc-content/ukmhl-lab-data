319 BllAlN. row, is the nodule or knot, (Das Knotchen) of Reil. The second surface of the brain is very different from the first. In situation it is interior or central; and its configuration is such, that it may be named the Jigurate or symmetrical surface of the brain. Instead of presenting the uniform eminences and hollows which distinguish the convoluted surface, it is disposed or moulded into definite shapes, which correspond with each other, as they are situate on opposite sides of the middle plane,—or the parts of which, when situate on this plane, are exactly symmetrical. The surface formed by these variously figured objects, bounds what are termed in the common descriptions the ventricles or cavities of the brain. I shall show that they cannot justly be termed cavities any more than the hollows between the convolutions, but ought to be viewed as continuations of the exterior or convoluted surface. As the several objects of the figurate surface are well known, I shall at pre- sent, avoiding minute description, notice those cir- cumstances only which have not been sufficiently studied, or correctly represented, or which are ne- cessary to establish the general principle,—that the convoluted surface of the brain and the lami- nated surface of the cerebellum communicate di- rectly with the inner, central, or figurate surface of these organs. The commutual or dichotomous region of the convoluted surface is terminated below by a si-

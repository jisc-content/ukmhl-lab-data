In the case of Scultetus, a cyst as large as a hen's egg, not unlike a hyda^ tid, was found in the left hemisphere. * In that of Panaroli, several whitish round bladders, con- taining pituitous fluid {Jiygroma P) were found in the mesolobe.f In that of Paw, a bladder contain- ing half-a-pound of limpid fluid was situate over the commissure of the optic nerves.| The case of P. Borelli was a cyst containing watery fluid, at- tached to the nates and infundibulum.^ That of Lancisi is styled a hydatid as large as a pi- geon's egg, thin, yellowish, jelly-like lymph, in the posterior part of the right hemisphere. || The ease of Wepfer, which was a cyst as large as a hen's egg, containing a turbid brownish liquor, ap- pears to belong rather to the head of hygroma.^ Those of Home, f f Rostan, X\ Headington, ^ and Morrah, || || though more recent, are not more un- equivocal, since their authors give no descrip- tion of the physical characters by which their claim to the title of hydatids might be determined. * Armamentarium, Obs. 10 and II. f Pentecoste i.

It is not easily cut, but rather gives way before the knife; and a portion of such a brain is easily lacerated, and falls down quickly in water. This diminished consistence, Avhich, though greatest at the centre, extends through the whole organ, depends partly on the deposition of the proper cerebral matter being interrupted, and partly on the admixture of serous fluid with its minute atoms. The texture or atomic constitu- tion of the organ is not altered. In diabetes a similar change takes place, chiefly from the former cause. In pulmonary consumption, whether depending on chronic bronchial inflammation, chronic pleu- risy, or on tubercular disorganization, the brain is invariably found softer than natiu-al. When the disease which induces death has continued long, this softness is very considerable, and amounts almost to semifluidity. It may then constitute a true cause of adventitious disease. This state of the brain, combined with a languid and retarded motion of the blood through the cerebral capil- laries, may be the pathological cause of the deli- rium, which, either alone or alternating with coma, not unfrequently precedes the death of phthisical patients. The cerebral capillaries in such subjects I have found large and numerous. Is the density of the brain diminished ? Meckel states that he found a cube of six lines of the brain of a man

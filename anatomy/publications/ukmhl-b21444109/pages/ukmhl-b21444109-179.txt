SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C, 157 Cullen imagined, into purulent matter. But the same vessels which, at an early stage of the pro- cess, secrete serous fluid containing lymph, at a more advanced period secrete purulent matter. This is easily proved by tracing the progressive changes in a large wound ; for instance an ampu- tated stump, an incision made into an inflamed swelling, or an incision made on purpose into the soft parts of an animal. The same general con- clusion results also from observing the progressive steps in the human body after a seton has been inserted, or an issue established. In the case of part of the surface being destroyed by caustic, ac- tual or potential, the process may be less distinct- ly observed ; but it is still nearly the same. Upon the whole, the natural course of pheno- mena in inflammation may be stated in the follow- ing order. First, vessels dilated and distended with blood, which moves more slowly than natu- ral. Secondly, the secretion or effusion from these vessels, or their exhalant terminations, of a fluid consisting of serum and coagulable matter, some- times with extravasation of blood. Thirdly, the secretion of purulent fluid from the same vessels. The intimate nature of the process by which purulent matter is formed is by no means well known. The notion of Grashuys, * that it arose from a liquefaction or melting of the adipose tis- sue, though adopted by Haller, f is too ridiculous to merit the slightest attention. It is sufficient to * De Suppuvatione. f Elementa, Lib. i. sect, 4.

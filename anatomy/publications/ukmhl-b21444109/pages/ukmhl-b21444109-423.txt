BRAIN. 401 mere general injection of the cerebral vessels. The same phenomenon appears to have been witnessed by Cheselden. (Book iii. chap. 14, p. 224.) If, on this point, my own observation be entitled to any weight, I may add, that in 1817 I had occa- sion to examine the body of a young woman who died with all the symptoms of well-marked apo- plexy ; and though every part of the brain was cut into minute portions with the utmost care, no effusion of red blood could be recognized. The only anormal appearance was some injection of the vessels going to the annular protuberance and medulla oblongata. * Mh, Though in several cases of persons cut off with well-marked apo- plectic symptoms, I have found extravasated blood, it bore no proportion to the severity of the dis- ease. Instead of being in the shape of clots in distinct cavities, it consisted simply of long linear streaks of blood stretching through parts of the brain, sometimes in the neighbourhood of blood- vessels. In such cases, however, the blood-ves- sels were much injected, especially in the vicinity of the membranes. Upon the whole, I conceive it legitimate to in- fer, that the essential anatomical character of apo- plexy is injection of the vessels of the brain more or less general. This may terminate in one of two modes, both of which are accidental and ac- cessory. The first is effusion of serous fluid; the second is effusion of red blood. Case of Ann Dinwiddie.

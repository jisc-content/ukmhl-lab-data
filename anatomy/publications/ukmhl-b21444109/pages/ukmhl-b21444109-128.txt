106 GENEllAI, ANATOMY. The principle now laid down Dr L. Koch of Munich has attempted to carry to a much greater length. Denying that hemorrhage, from arteries entirely divided, is suppressed in the manner now mentioned, denying especially the formation of the double clot as a uniform result of transverse divi- sion, he has recourse to the supposition of a pecu- liar force and action to account for the cessation of hemorrhage. He denies the necessity of liga- ture in any case, and proposes to leave large as well as small vessels untied. His arguments are manifestly derived from the phenomena of the di- vision of small arteries only, and cannot there- fore be justly applied to large ones. I have al- ready shown, that in the case of the former the annular contraction is the main agent of the ces- sation of hemorrhage ; and to this, I conceive, corresponds the peculiar force to which Dr Koch ascribes that process. * When an artery is lacerated or forcibly rent asunder, the same process of injection, coagulation, retraction, and annular constriction take place, but more powerfully and more speedily than in the case of the same artery divided transversely by a cut- ting instrument. The external clot especially is formed very rapidly; the internal one is large and extensive ; and the annular contraction of the la- cerated vessel is much more considerable. (Guthrie and others.)

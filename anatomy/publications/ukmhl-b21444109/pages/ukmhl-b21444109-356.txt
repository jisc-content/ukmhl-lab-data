334 GENElliVI, ANATOMY. qiient examination, with a little attention, will enable the student to overcome all the difficulties with which they may be attended. The parts contained in the mass of brain removed, as we de- scribed in the last section, will contribute also very much to render the knowledge of this border easy and intelligible. I have already said (p. 322,) that at the posterior end of the middle band the inner or lower border is formed by the four eminences (c. quadrigemina) situate on the upper surface of the thick mass named protuberance. On each side of these the inner border is formed by suc- cessive portions of the optic chamber, until it has reached the inferior region of this body, where the outer and lower margin of the limb of the brain becomes the border of the opening. To render this arrangement more intelligible, I shall here state some circumstances of the figurate sur- face, which are either omitted in the ordinary de- scriptions, or are mentioned indistinctly. Its principal objects are familiarly known; and there are certainly none who can be ignorant of the situation of the striated bodies, the optic chamber, the semicircular chord between them, and other similar objects. The posterior eminences, or the optic chambers, hold the most important place; and their connec- tion and relative situation render them much more interesting than they are usually made in works of descriptive anatomy.

VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 131 deposition of lymph and union of its free surfaces producing obliteration of the canal of the vessel. Dr Baillie mentions an instance of obliteration of the lower cava, from the emulgent veins to the entrance of the vence cavcB liejjiaticce, which he as- cribes to effusion of lymph and consequent adhe- sion ; * and Mr Wilson records a similar case in which about four ounces of well-formed puru- lent fluid were found in the vena cava immediate- ly below the liver, and a considerable quantity of coagulated lymph below the entrance of the three large hepatic veins, {vence cava; hepaticce,) which at once united the opposite sides of the vessel, and prevented this fluid from proceeding to the heart, f Similar examples of obliteration are recorded by Haller, Morgagni, and by Hodgson, \. and Breschet. It is easy to perceive how the pressure of tumours may cause obliteration of these vessels. When any venous tube, under such circumstances, be- comes impervious, the collateral communications afford channels for continuing the motion of the blood. 4. Varix. This consists in permanent dilatation of the venous coats beyond their natural capacity. It is in general, if excessive, confined to one spot; but sometimes a whole vein becomes more or less dilated through its entire course.

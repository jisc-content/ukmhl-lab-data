FILAMENTOUS Oil CELLULAR TISSUE. 25 place in insufflation or separation by forceps, cavi- ties appear to be formed, these, it will be found, are artificial, and result from the separation of an infinity of the slender filaments of which the part is composed. These interlinear spaces necessarily communicate on every side with each other; and indeed the most distinct way of forming a true idea of the structure of the cellular tissue is to suppose a certain space of the animal body which is divid- ed and intersected into an infinite multitude of mi- nute spaces, {areola,) by slender thready lines cros- sing each other. This description, originally derived from per- sonal observation, led me to apply to this tissue the name offilamentous as more appropriate than that of cellular, by which it is generally known. I find, however, that in this I am anticipated by Charles Augustus de Bergen, the most accurate observer who has treated of its anatomical struc- ture. His description is so faithful that it should be known to the student of general anatomy. " Alteram vero non adeo distincte saltern paucissi- mis, ut mihi videtur, observatam." He alludes here to the filamentous as distinct from the adi- pose tissue. " Ubi sic dicta cellulosa ex innumera atque intricatissima congerie staminum aut fila- mentorum, nullatenus cellulas pinguedinem conti- nentes efFormantium, componitur; quae tenerrima mirific^ obliqu^ disposita, inexplicabili adeo con- tentu viscerum omnium et musculorum substan- tiam internam perreptant, ut nihil certi vel mi-

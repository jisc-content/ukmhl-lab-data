654 GENERAL ANATOMY Some of these discordant statements Hedwig attempts with equal ingenuity and industry to re- concile. The difference in shape he refers to dif- ferences in the animals examined ; and in one class finds them cylindrical, {e.g. in man and the horse;) in another conical, (the dog;) in a third club-shaped, (the pheasant;) and in a fourth point- ed or pyramidal, {e. g. the mouse.) The interior structure he also represents as spongy in all the animals which he examined ; and invariably also he found at the apex the orifice of the duct, which, after the example of Lieberkuhn, he conceives constitutes the ampuUula.^ These conclusions are not exactly confirmed by the researches of Rudolphi, who examined the V)illi in man and a considerable number of animals. This anatomist never found the orifice seen by Hedwig, notwithstanding every care taken to per- ceive it. He maintains that the villi are not alike in all parts of the intestinal canal of the same ani- mal, as represented by Hedwig, but may be cylin- drical in one part, club-shaped in another, and acuminated in a third. Admitting their vascular structure, which he thinks may be demonstrated, he regards the ampullular expansion as doubtful, and denies its cellular arrangement.f * Disquisitio Ampullularum Lieberkuhnii Physico-Mi- croscopica.

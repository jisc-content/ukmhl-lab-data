MUSCULAR TISSUE 489 do not exceed the i of an inch, and that the smal- lest are not less than ib- By cutting a muscle across, these bundles are observed to differ not only in size but in shape. Some are oblong and rhomboidal; others present a triangular or quadrangular section ; and in some even the irregular pentagon or polygon may be recognized. These bundles are united by filamentous tissue of various degrees of delicacy, as may be shown by the effects of boiling ; and the muscle thus formed is penetrated by arteries, veins, and ner- vous twigs, and is enclosed by filamentous tissue, which often contains fat. This fascicular arrangement appears to be con- fined to the muscles of voluntary motion. It is not very distinct in the heart or diaphragm; and in the urinary bladder and intestinal canal I have not recognized it. Nor is the parallel arrange- ment of the ultimate filaments always strictly ob- served in the involuntary muscles. The compo- nent fibres of this order of muscles are often ob- served to change direction, and unite at angles with each other. This fact, which was observed by Lewenhoeck, has been verified by Prochaska. The colour of muscle varies. In man and the mammiferous animals, at least adult, it is more or less red; in many birds and fishes it is known to be whitish ; in young animals it is grayish or cream-coloured; and the slender fibres which form the middle coat of the intestines in all animals are

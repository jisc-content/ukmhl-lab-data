GENERAL ANATOMY. 458 spherical or spheroidal bodies separate from each other. «. One or two homogeneous masses of consider- able size. Mangetus is among the first who notices near the corpora qnaclrigemina a body like a seba- ceous gland, hard and friabJe, which there is reason to believe was one solitary tubercular mass. The two similar which he found in the same brain be- tween the convolutions, if not belonging to the membranes, were examples of the same growth in the convoluted substance. I have already mentioned under another head the case of Huber, which is probably an example of the same nature. The second one of Merat, if really tubercular, is also an instance of this form of the tubercular deposit. Many others are recorded by different authors. Thus Rochoux gives an in- stance of a tubercular tumour in the cerebellum, in all respects similar to those of the lungs.* Dr Powell's seventh case is an instance of large tu- bercular masses in the white matter of the right hemisphere, f To the same head also belong the cheese-like tumour described by Sir Gilbert Blane;:]^ the white tubercle represented by Baillie, (Plate VII. Fascic. 10;) and the instance given by Coindet in the annular protuberance; § the instance of an albuminous mass as large as an egg in the ante- * Recherches sur I'Apoplexie, Obs. xxxix. p. 151. t Transactions of the College of Physicians, Vol. v. p. 222. % Transactions of a Society, Vol. ii. § Memoire sur I'Hydrencephale, p.^106 and 107-

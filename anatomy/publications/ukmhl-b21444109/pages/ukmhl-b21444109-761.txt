737 SEROUS MEMBRANE. of the distribution and configuration of the pellu- cid membranes. Thus they have neither begin- ning nor termination ; they have neither orifice nor egredient canal; and they are not continuous with any other membrane or texture. Every serous membrane consists of a hollow sac everywhere closed, and to the cavity or inte- rior surface of which there is no natural entrance ; a circumstance from which they have been deno- minated shut sacs, (sacci occlusi; sacs sans ouver- ture.) In every serous membrane one part is in- verted or inflected, or reflected, as is commonly said, within the other, so that the inner surface of the former part is applied with more or less accu- racy to the inner or like surface of the latter. This mode of disposition has suggested to anato- mists the homely and trite, but not inappropri- ate comparison of a serous membrane to a night- cap, one-half of which is folded or doubled with- in the other, so that while one-half of the inner surface is applied to the remaining half, no com- munication exists between the inner and the outer surface. Every serous membrane, in short, is a single sac, one-half of which is doubled within the other. In every serous membrane the outer surface of the unreflected portion is applied over the walls of the region which the serous membrane lines, while the outer surface of the inflected portion is applied over the organ or organs contained in that region. From this arrangement it results that each organ 3 A

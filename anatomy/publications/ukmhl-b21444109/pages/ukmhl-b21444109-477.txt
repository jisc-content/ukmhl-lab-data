BRAIN. 455 Did this originate in the pia maler, in which it appears to have been enclosed ? Joannes Rhodius, Centuria i. Observat. 55—In the ven- tricle of the brain of a noble Bolognian a fleshy tumour gave rise to epileptic fits. Miscellanea Curiosa. In the substance of the brain a tu- mour like a strumous gland. Johan. Jac. Wagner, Miscellan. Curios. Dec. ii. Ann. lO A boy of 14 ,suffering pain in the forehead and occipital region near the junction with the vertebrse, coming on in paroxysms, relieved by vomiting; epileptic symptoms and death. In the white matter of the posterior part of the brain (occipital,) a preternatural hard sebaceous gland, friable; in the convolutions of the anterior lobe two glands ; in the end . of the cerebellum, near the calamus scriptoriiis, one as large as a walnut. Memoires de I'Academie Royale.—In the right corpus stri- atum a glandular substance the size of a bean. Joh. Gottfr. Zinn. apud Comment. Soc. Reg. Scientiarum Gottingensis, Tom. ii. 1752—In an infant affected with en- larged lymphatic glands a hard substance as large as a wal- nut. Of this, however, he neglected to preserve an accurate account. In another infant, part of the left hemisphere of the cere- bellum, to the extent at least of two inches, was converted into five hardish bodies of different sizes, yellow, like hard- ened lymphatic glands, mutually adhering. In some parts the traces of the circular leaflets of the cerebellic plates was left; in others they had disappeared, and left a uniform in- organic mass. The pia maler was readily detached, except at the middle of the hard mass, where it adhered so firmly that it could not be removed without laceration. The con- tiguous vessels were injected. In an adult female, he observed beneath the parietal bone in the convoluted part of the brain three similar hard bodies, each as large as a nutmeg. They adhered to the dura maler ; and, in all probability, they originated in that membrane.

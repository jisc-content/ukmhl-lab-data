MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 1555 About the same time Bleuland, who had pre- viously examined the intestinal mucous mem- brane, after successful injection of its capillaries, undertook to revive the leading circumstances of the description of Lieberkuhn. By examining microscopically well-injected portions of intestine, he shows that the villi are composed of a system of very minute arterial and venous capillaries, en- closing a lacteal which constitutes the ampulla, and in the interior of which a certain order of these capillaries terminates. He also revives the statement of the absorbing orifice at the extremity of each villus. * The rest of the observations of this author pertain rather to the distribution of the minute vessels, and shall be more particularly noticed under that head. The observations of Beclard on these bodies are most perspicuous. Accoi-ding to this anato- mist the intestinal villi appear neither conical, nor cylindrical, nor tubular, nor expanded at top, as described by several authors, but in the shape of leaflets or minute plates so closely set that they form an abundant tufted pile. Their shape varies according to the manner in which they are ex- amined, and according to the part. Those of the pyloric half of the stomach and duodenum are broader than long, and form minute plates ; those of the jejunum are long and narrow, constituting * Jani Bleuland, M.D. &c.

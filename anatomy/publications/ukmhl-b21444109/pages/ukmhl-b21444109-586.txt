GENEKAI, ANATOMY. 562 Houstet,* Herissantjf Flajani,:]; and Monteggia, has been verified by Howship. Sometimes it occurs in one point of the bone in the form of a sphe- roidal tumour, in which the osseous matter is ar- ranged in the form of long needle-like fibres, ra- diating from one or more points, not unlike ra- diated zeolite. In other instances it occurs in the form of amorphous masses of bone, much like pieces of calcareous sinter. (Houstet.) In others again, a central granular mass is surrounded by -acicular bony fibres. Of these growths the interior structure varies. They are never masses of solid bone; but the bony matter is so arranged that it leaves spaces or intervals filled in some instances with soft flesh-coloured spongy matter, (the fungous exos- tosis of Sir A. Cooper;) in others Avith cartilage, (J. Bell, A. Cooper,) (the cartilaginous exostosis ;J in others with colloid or jelly-like matter, (J. Bell;) in others with semifluid blood-like matter, (Hous- tet ;) and in some instances they have been known to contain hydatids. (Keate,&c.) In all cases the pe- riosteum is thickened; the tumour is penetrated by numerous large vessels; and the bone in which the exostosis is formed is more or less thinned and destroyed by absorption.

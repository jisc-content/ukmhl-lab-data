602 GENERAL ANATOMY. its nature and structure we find many conjectures, but few or no facts in the writings of anatomists ; and almost all that has been written is the result of analogical inference, rather than of direct ob- servation. It is known that they di-op off with the scarf-skin in the dead body; that they are destroyed or diseased by causes which act on the outer surface of the corion, and produce disease of the cuticle; and that, if forcibly torn out, the sur- face of the corion to which they were attached bleeds profusely and inflames. In other respects they ai'e quite inorganic; but these facts appear to warrant the conclusion, that the root of the nail is connected with the organic substance of the corion, and that the whole substance is the result of a process of secretion quite similar to that by which the cuticle is formed. According to the experiments of Hatchett, they consist of a svibstance which possesses the proper- ties of coagulated albumen, with a very small trace of phosphate of lime. The root of a hair is not only that part which is contained in the bulb, but the portion which is lodged in the skin. The middle part and the point are those which project beyond the surface of the skin. The bulb is a small sac fixed in the inner surface of the corion, in the contiguous fila- mentous tissue, and receiving the extremity or root of the hair implanted in it. Every hair is cylindrical, tapering regularly from the root to the point, and solid, but contain- ing its proper colouring matter in its substance.

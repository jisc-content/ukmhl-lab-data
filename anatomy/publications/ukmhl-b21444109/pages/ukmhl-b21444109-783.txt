759 SEROUS MEMBRANE. lucid layer outside, without intermediate filamen- tous tissue,—a peculiarity in which it resembles the female ovary. Section II. The serous membranes are the seat of a considerable num- ber of morbid processes^ which, according as they take place in one membrane or another, give rise to several of those diseases which it is the province of nosology to distinguish and of medicine to treat. Most of these processes may be referred to inflammation or its effects, dropsy, hemorrhage, new growths, and morbid deposits. 1. Inflammation occurs in serous membrane under at least two forms, acute and chronic. The anatomical characters of the process vary according to its acute or chronic character, and according to the physiological peculiarities of the affec- ted membrane. These characters it is perhaps most conve- nient to examine as they appear in the pleura, pericardium^ and peritonfEum, in which they assume their most perfect form. When inflammation commences in a serous or diaphanous membrane, the first change which is observed to take place in it, is diminution or loss of its transparent and glistening appearance. * It becomes opaque, dull, and in some instances dry. This change is very well seen, not only in the pleura, pericardium, and peritonaeum, but in the arachnoid mem- brane, in which it is distinct when other traces of the pro- cess cannot be recognized. It is from this circumstance that dulness of the arachnoid denotes, with great certainty, serous effusion in the cerebral cavities. » " When inflammation," says Hunter, " takes place in parts that have a degree of transparency, that transparency is lessened. This is probably best seen in membranes, such as those membranes which line cavities or cover bodies in those cavities, such as the pia mater, where in a natural state we may observe the blood-vessels to be very distinct."--4to.

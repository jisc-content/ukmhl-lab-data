660 GENERAL ANATOMY. two mucous surfaces never in the healthy state secrete any modification of this animal matter ; and in others the membrane is almost always moistened by a different fluid. The mucous or villous membrane of the eyelids is never in the healthy state occupied with mucus, but is uni- formly moistened with the tears ; the membrane of the mouth and throat is moistened with saliva only ; the urethra presents a peculiar viscid fluid, which seems to exude from many minute vessels opening along its surface, as in the lacunee, but which is widely different from mucus. All those parts, in short, which are not in perpetual, but only occasional, contact with foreign or secreted substances, seem to present no mucus in the healthy state; whereas the surfaces of the sto- mach, intestines, gall-bladder, and urinary blad- der, are constantly covered with a quantity, more or less considerable, of this animal secretion. The chemical properties of mucous membranes are completely unknown. The analysis of the fluid secreted by them has been executed by Four- croy, Berzelius, and others, but is foreign to the subject of this work. The mucous membranes are most liberally sup- plied with blood by vessels which are both large and numerous. This is proved not only by the phenomena of injections, but by the red colour of which many of their divisions are the seat. This coloration, as weU as the injectibility, is not in- deed uniform ; for in certain regions mucous sur- faces are pale or light blue; in others their red- ness is considerable.

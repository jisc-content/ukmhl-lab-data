MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 657 health these bodies are so minute that it is very- difficult to recognize them. I have seen them, nevertheless, in the tracheo-bronchial membrane by the eye and by a lens. When the membranes are inflamed they become larger and more distinct. In the bladder, the womb, the gall-bladder, and the seminal vesicles, they are not distinctly seen, and cannot be satisfactorily demonstrated. It is unnecessary, however, to follow the example of Bichat in trusting to analogy to prove their ex- istence ; for they are not necessary to the secre- tion of mucous fluid as he seems to imagine. Those in the urethra, first well described by William Cowper, are distinct examples of fol- licles in the genito-urinary surface. The sinuo- sities (lacunce), first accurately described, if not discovered by Morgagni, * though not exactly the same in conformation and structure, seem to be very slightly different. In certain regions of the mucous membranes, more especially at their connections with the skin, are found minute conical eminences denominated papUlcB. They are distinctly seen in the mucous membrane of the tongue, where they vary in size and shape, and in the body named clitoris. They are elevations belonging to the mucous corion, and they are liberally supplied by blood-vessels, the veins of which present an erectile arrangement, and with minute nervous filaments. Of the in- timate structure of these bodies, however, little * Adversaria Anatomica, iv. 8, 9, &c. T t

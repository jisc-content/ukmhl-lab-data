AVHITE FIBROUS SYSTEM. 517 their migrations may be traced from one extre- mity to another of an aponeurotic membrane, and along- the course of its principal divisions. 3. The kind of pain which attends rheumatism re- sembles that of the fibrous tissues in general when inflamed in undergoing aggravation under the in- fluence of external heat and during the night. 4. This view of the seat of rheumatic disorder affords the most probable explanation of the effusion which takes place in the tendinous sheaths (bursce mu- cosee;) for since each sheath is partly enveloped in aponeurotic membrane, the inflammatory process which takes place in the latter soon gives rise, as in analogous cases, to effusion, critical or non-cri- tical, from the contiguous synovial membrane. 5. This view also affords the most rational explana- tion of the fact remarked by all authors, that rheu- matism almost never terminates in suppuration. To suppose that muscle does not suppurate, is perhaps erroneous from what has been above adduced. That fascia and fibrous tissue in gene- ral is little disposed to suppurate, unless when mechanically injured, is manifest from a number of circumstances; and this may perhaps be re- garded as the true explanation of the fact now noticed. 6. It must further be remarked, that in- flammation in this tissue renders it thick, hard, and rigid, and occasionally causes between its fibres effusion of lymph, which increases this thickening, induration, and rigidity. On these changes depend the immobility of rheumatic parts,

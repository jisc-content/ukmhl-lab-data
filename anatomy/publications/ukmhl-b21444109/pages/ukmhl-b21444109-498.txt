From its situation I have often been inclined to think that it is a secretion from the vessels of the choroid web. Petrifaction, or osseous induration of the whole brain, has not been seen in the human subject. Instances, however, of this in the lower animals have been recorded by Duverney, Simson, Pitchell, and Renauld. 7). Encysted Tumours.â€”Of these any of the forms may probably be found in the brain. Hither- to, however, those actually said to occur may be referred to one or other of the following heads. a. Hydatoid or vesicular tumours. It may be justly doubted whether the genuine animal hyda- tid {Cysticercus cellulosus, Rudolphi), has ever been found in the brain. Though stated gene- rally by Bremser, he mentions no authority;* it is never noticed by Rudolphi ;f and seems to be denied entirely by Blainville. None of the social hydatids {Coenuri and Echinococci) were found in that situation, till M. C. RendtorfF discovered in 1811 a cluster of the latter sort in the right ven- tricle of a girl of 8, who, after remaining hemiple- gic for some months, died lethargic. | Notwithstanding this, instances of bodies de- scribed as hydatids occurring in the brain have * Traite Zoologique, &c.

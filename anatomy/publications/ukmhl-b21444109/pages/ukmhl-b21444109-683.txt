659 MUCOUS MEMBRANE. denum, and for a considerable space towards the liver, the interior appearance is that of a fine mu- cous surface provided with lacunce and villosi- ties ; but it is impossible to say at what point of the hepatic duct, or of the smaller canals of which it is formed, the mucous membrane terminates. The tracheal membrane, when traced to the bronchial divisions, presents no arrangement, either of papillce, piles, or villosities ; and no- thing is perceived except a smooth uniform sur- face, of a colour between gray, dun, and red or purple, which is moistened with a viscid semi- transparent fluid, and which is as like the perito- naeum as the intestinal mucous membrane. Lastly, the situation where the existence of the mucous system, though believed, is most uncertain, is in the interior of the vasa deferentia, and where they take their origin from the vasa efferentia of the testis. Regarding the organization of these tubes, no sensible evidence can be obtained, and whatever is stated concerning it is the result of analogical inference. Though these membranes have been designat- ed by the general name of mucous, it is not to be understood that the action of their surface is in every situation the same. It is not easy to limit the signification of the term mucus; for it ap- pears that this fluid varies in the nasal passages, in the trachea and bronchial membrane, in the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, and in the urinary bladder and ureters. But it may be stated as a certain fact, that many parts of the

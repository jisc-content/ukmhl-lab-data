Lastly^ M. Bouillaud records a case in which a man of 68, who, after cerebral disease regarded as chronic softening, had impaired memory, headach, and difficulty of expressing ideas, terminating in muscular weakness, and fatal convulsions. In this, with injection of the cerebral substance, was induration passing from the striated body of the left hemisphere through the nucleus, at the upper region of which it formed a cavity with hard yel- low walls, and a similar hardened portion in the posterior lobe, f From these and similar facts no doubt can be entertained of the tendency of the process of in- flammation to indurate the brain under certain circumstances. The difficulty consists in ascer- taining what are the conditions under which a process usually terminating in softening should give rise to an opposite change. It is probably premature to attempt any explanation of a process so contradictory in appearance. I shall merely say, that induration seems in general to be occa- * Recherches Anatomico-Patliologiques sur I'Encephale et ses dependances, par F. Lallemand.

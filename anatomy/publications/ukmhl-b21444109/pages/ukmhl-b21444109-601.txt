The inter- stitial cells are filled with brownish jelly-like sub- stance, * which appears to be a secretion from the medullary arteries. The bone is soft, of the con- sistence of cartilage, and is easily cut by the knife. Its colour is some shade of red, but varies from light pink or brown to an orange or fawn- coloured tint. This it derives from its vessels, which are numerous, large, and loaded with dark- coloured blood deficient in fibrin. The periosteum is generally thickened, and occasionally detached. (Cheselden, Bichat, Bonn.) In short, the rachitic bone is the foetal bone in internal structure, but destitute of its proportion of calcareous matter. One of the peculiarities of the rachitic condition of the osseous system is, that though the bones present the characters now enumerated during its continuance, they afterwards acquire equal or even greater firmness and density than sound bones, by the deposition of calcareous matter. While this takes place, the distinction between the cancellated and compact structure begins to be established, and the formation of medullary canal is also begun. When this process once commences, it proceeds much as in healthy bone. In one respect, however, its completion is pecu- liar. Instead of the compact matter of the bone being equally distributed on each side of the me- * Morel in Jour, de Med.

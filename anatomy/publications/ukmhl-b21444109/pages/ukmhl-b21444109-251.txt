LYMPHATIC SYSTEMs &C. 229 which at present requires further verification. (I.) The statements of Lippi of Florence, that every lymphatic almost communicates freely with ve- nous tubes, is still more improbable, and has been rendered exceedingly doubtful by the recent re- searches of Rossi. * The connections of the ends of lymphatics with the organs and tissues from which they arise, termed their origins, are completely un- known. In some favourable instances the lym- phatics of the intestinal canal are so filled with a reddish or whitish fluid after the process of di- gestion has continued for some time, that not only are their larger branches easily seen, but by the aid of the microscope some of the smaller may be traced to their commencement. This, which was ascertained by Cruickshank, (p. 55 and 58,) and confirmed by Hewson, Bleuland, and Hed- wig, has been contradicted by the observations of Rudolphi and Albert Meckel. In all other parts, however, though a successful injection may show the course and distribution of many of the smallest lymphatics, yet no orifices are perceptible at the point at which they seem to stop, and we are un- certain whether these points are their origins.

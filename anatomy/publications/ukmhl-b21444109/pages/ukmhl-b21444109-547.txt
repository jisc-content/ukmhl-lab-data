YELLOW FIBROUS SYSTEM. 5S5 order of fibrous tissues, to which he applied the denomination of yellow or tawny fibrous system. Under this he includes also the proper membrane of the arteries ; that of the veins and of the lym- phatic vessels ; the membranes which form excre- tory ducts ; that of the air-passages ; the fibrous covering of the cavernous body of the urethra, and perhaps that of the spleen. The actions and occa- sional distensions of which these parts are the seat require, it is said, a tissue, the resistance and elas- ticity of which may at once counteract any extra- ordinary effort, and cause them to resume their original state, when the distending cause ceases to operate. In the lower animals this purpose is more conspicuous than in the human subject. The posterior cervical ligament {J,\gamentum nu- clicB, Arab.; cervicis, Lat.) counteracts the tenden- cy to inclination of the head ; and a similar mem- brane strengthens the abdominal parietes, and re- sists the weight and distending power of the vis- cera. In the feline tribe, an elastic ligament in- serted into the unguinal phalanges retains them ex- tended so long as the muscles do not alter their direction. The shells of the bivalve moUuscous animals, as oysters, mussels, &c. are opened by a similar fibrous tissue as soon as the muscles which close them are relaxed. The disposition of the component fibres is the same in the elastic as in the common white fibrous system. Their colour, which is yellow or tawny, is generally more distinct in the dead subject. They are said to be less tenacious, but more elas-

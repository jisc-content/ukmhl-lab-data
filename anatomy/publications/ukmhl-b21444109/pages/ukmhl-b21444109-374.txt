352 GENERAL ANATOMY. face of the bridge, this combination of long and cross bands is less distinct. Part, if not the whole of the transverse fibres, sink into the pe- duncles or crura of the cerebellum; and they evidently predominate here over the longitudinal. The posterior-upper part of the medulla oblon- gata consists of two longitudinal bodies separated on the median line by a deep furrow. These, which are the restiform or rope-like processes, cliordalprocesses of Ridley, (corpora restiformia,) (processus restiformes, Morgagni,) are described in most works as the pyramidal eminences. (Hal- ler, Malacarne, Reil.) As there is no doubt that this part of the spinal chord presents six eminences, three on each side, as above stated, with the view of avoiding the confusion with which anatomists speak on these bodies, I adhere to the plan origi- nally 'adopted by WiUis, Ridley, Ruysch, and Morgagni, of distinguishing the anterior eminen- ces as pyramidal, and the posterior as the resti- form processes. * â€¢ " The third descends from this part (the cerebellum) back- wards upon the upper side of the medulla oblongata, like two longish thick chords on each side, making the medidla look somewhat thicker and broader in that place, and not unfitly styled the chordal process." The Anatomy of the Brain, &c. By H. Ridley, Coll. Med. Lond. Soc. London, \6q5, chap, xiv. p. 136. The terra processus restiformis is a literal trans- lation of this, given by his Latin translator, and in the col- lection of Mangetus. It is remarkable, that, though thus early noticed by Ridley, and afterwards distinguished as l>osterior pyramidal eminences by Ruysch, the restiform pro-

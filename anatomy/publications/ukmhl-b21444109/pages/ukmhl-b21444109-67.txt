F1I,AMENT0US OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 47 nules, which give the brawny aspect and sensa- tion already mentioned. (Leger.) The greatest firmness and induration are generally remarked in the outer region of the legs, and in the dorsal re- gion of the foot and hand, and this gives the mem- bers the air of a peculiar twist or distortion. The adipose membrane appears to be not much less the seat of this disease than the filamentous tissue. The bodies of infants cut off by this disease are small, being of the medium height of seventeen inches ; and all the organs are imperfectly deve- loped. Thus the lungs are hard, marbled, un- crepitating, and sink in water; the windpipe is small, and the alimentary canal is shorter than usual in healthy infants of the same age. The heart, however, is large, and generally contains blood in clots. The foramen ovale is often open, and the arterial duct is never closed. The peri- cardium, and frequently the cavities of the serous membranes, contain more or less serous fluid. The nature of this morbid change is unknown. The old notion of Uzembezius revived by Andry and Auvity, that it was occasioned by coagulation of the fluids frozen by extreme cold, is completely contradicted by the fact recorded by Leger, that among forty-four infants dead during the month of June 1823 in the Foundling Hospital of Paris, twenty-one were cut off" by induration of the cel- lular tissue. The notion of Alard, that it is al- lied with the glandular disease of Barbadoes, scarcely deserves mention. On the contrary, its early occurrence after birth, the imperfect deve-

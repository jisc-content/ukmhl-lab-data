VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 127 system, {anastomoses, inosculatioues,) are more nu- merous and frequent than those of the arterial. 1. The minute veins communicate so freely as to form a perfect net-work. 2. In the twigs, though more rare, these communications are still frequent. 3. In the branches, though less numerous, they are never- theless observed ; and in this respect alone the venous must be greatly more numerous than the arterial inosculations, which are confined chiefly to the smaller and more remote parts of the system. These inosculations, indeed, between the venous branches constitute one of the most peculiar and im- portant characters of their arrangement, in so far as by their means the communication is maintained between the superficial and deep-seated vessels of the system. Thus the emissary veins are the channel of communication between the cerebral sinuses and the temporal, occipital, and other ex- ternal veins. The external and internal jugulars communicate by one or two considerable vessels. And the free communication between the basilic and cephalic by the median veins, that between them and the deep brachial vessel, and that between the saphena and its branches and the femoral vein, are sufficiently well known. The applica- tion of these anatomical facts to the ready motion of the venous blood is obvious. But of all the communications between the branches or large vessels of the venous system the most important, both anatomically and physiolo- gically, is that maintained by means of the vetia

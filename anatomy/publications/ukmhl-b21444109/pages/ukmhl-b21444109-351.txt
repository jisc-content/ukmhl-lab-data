329 BRAIN. band, which shows not only the relative connection of the several parts, but serves also to demonstrate a curious fact in the configuration of the parts forming the outer border of the communication. This is the hippocampus through its entire course, or the body which its figure has led Professor Chaussier to name the cylindroidprocess. This body consists essentially of two parts. The first is an inner or central portion, gray in colour, notched or indented in appearance, and though free at the indented edge, adhering to the cerebral substance by its opposite margin. This is the gray mdented hand. (Gordon;â€”le corps godron7iee, Vicq-D'Azyr.) It is as thick as a large crow-quill. This is covered by the outer or second part, which is a broad thin plate of white cerebral matter rolled or folded over the gray in- dented band, precisely as a map is rolled over a cylinder of wood, and covering it unless removed by art. This last part of the cylindroid process is what is well known, and always described under the name of the tape or fillet of the hippocampus. Its arrangement with regard to the gray indented band is less generally understood, and is indeed never noticed in the ordinary descriptions. A correct idea of it may be formed in the following manner. Divide, by successive transverse sections, the hippocampus from the part named the foot up- wards, as far as it can be traced. It will be found that each section presents a central portion of gray

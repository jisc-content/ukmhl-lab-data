ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 105 lated blood effused into the sheath, (coagulum ex- ternum,) and a conical or cylindrical plug of the same material (coagulum internum,) within the mouth of the divided vessel. * When by the for- mation of this double clot a temporary check to the transit of blood is given, inflammation and lymphy exudation from the divided edges tend to supply the means of permanent suppression. When this fails false aneurism is the consequence. In the case of small vessels the annular con- traction bears a larger proportion cceteris paribus to the size of the vessel; and it exercises a great- er influence in arresting the current of blood through the divided orifice. With the pressure of the external and internal clots, and the recession of the divided portions, this annular contraction is in general amply sufficient to stop permanently the effusion of blood fi*om small vessels. Hence in partial wounds of such vessels as the radial, the ulnar, and the temporal arteries, the entire divi- sion of the vessel is often the most effectual means of checking the flow of blood from them. In am- putation also, in which the arteries are divided transversely, the smaller vessels may be left un- tied without danger. * " The mouth of the artery being no longer pervious, nor a collateral branch very near it, the blood just within it is at rest, coagulates, and forms in general a slender conical coagulum, which neither fills up the canal of the arteryj nor adheres to its sides, except by a small portion of the circumference of its base, which lies neai* the extremity of the vessel."â€”Jones on Hemorrhage, Chap. I. sect. iii. p. 53.

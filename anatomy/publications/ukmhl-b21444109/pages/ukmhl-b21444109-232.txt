210 GENERAL ANATOMY. cardium, and in the peritoneum, it is not unusual to find bloody fluids of various tints, evidently the result of exhalation. The fluid effused may be simply bloody serum if little blood is exhaled, very red if more is poured forth, or even, as I shall show afterwards, it may be pure blood. In seve- ral of the cases in which blood is found in the ventricles of the brain it cannot be traced to any other source save the exhalants of the choroid plexus ; and blood may be shown to be effused occasionally from the outer division of the arach- noid membrane, and also from that which covers the spinal chord. In each of these cases, whether the fluid is merely sanguinolent or is pure blood, it issues from the same vessels which, in the healthy state of the membrane, prepare its proper secretions. No rup- ture or breach can be recognized by the most ac- curate scrutiny. Bichat is disposed to view the sanguinolent effusions as the effect of inflamma- tion, acute or chronic, or like dropsy, as the con- sequence of organic disease. The few cases hi- therto accurately recorded show, that, whatever be the remote cause, the state of the capillaries of the serous membranes is much the same as those of mucous surfaces under similar circumstances. I formerly spoke of hemorrhage occurring in cellular membrane. The blood is in this case de- rived from the exhalants of that tissue exactly as it issues from those of the serous membranes. As an active hemorrhage, it is not unfrequent in se- vere phlegmon, and in the bloody abscess, as it is

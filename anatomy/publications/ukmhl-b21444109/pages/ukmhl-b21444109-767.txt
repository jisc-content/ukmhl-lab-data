SEROUS MEMBRANE. 743 stipata;) * and this view is adopted and main- tained by Bordeu, f Bichat, | Meckel, ^ and Be- clard, II the last of whom, however, thinks they partake of ligamentous characters. Macerated they become soft, thick, and pulpy ; and are final- ly resolved into flocculent filamentous matter. In the course of decomposition in the dead subject they first lose their glistening aspect, then be- come covered by a foul dirty coating of viscid matter, which appears to exude from their sur- face ; and eventually they are dissolved into shreds. Immersion in boiling water renders them thick, firm, and somewhat crisp. When dried they be- come thin, clear, and transparent, and, if pre- served from humidity or the attacks of animals, may remain long unchanged. The experiments of Hatchett, Fourcroy, and Vauquelin, show that they contain gelatin and a little albumen ; but no precise information on their chemical composition has yet been given. The principal character of the serous mem- branes is that of isolating the organs which they cover, and to the structure of which they are fo- reign or adventitious, and forming shut cavities, in which there is an incessant process of exhala- tion and absorption. In some instances they evi- dently contribute to facilitate the mutual motions * Elem. Physiolog. Lib. iv. sect. i. ยง i. xvi. Lib. xxii. t Recherches sur le Tissu Muqueux, sect. i. ยง i. X Anat.

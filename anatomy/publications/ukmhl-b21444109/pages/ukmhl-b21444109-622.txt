GENERAL ANATOMY. 598 ance of whom he ascribes to the absence of the mucous net of the skin. The corion of the human skin (pellis, corium, derma, cutis vera) seems to consist chiefly of very small dense fibres, not unlike those of the proper arterial coat, closely interwoven with each other, and more firmly compacted the nearer they are to its outer or cuticular surface. The inner surface of the corion is of a gray colour ; and in almost all parts of the body presents a number of depres- sions varying in size from i^th to i^oth of an inch, and consequently forming spaces or intervals between them. These depressions, which corre- spond to eminences in the subjacent adipose tissue, have been termed areolce. They are wanting in the corion of the back of the hand and foot only. The outer or cuticular surface of the corion is quite smooth, of a pale or flesh-red tinge, and is much more vascular than its inner surface. It presents, further, a number of minute conical eminences (jjapillce,) which, according to the re- cent observations of Gaultier* and Dutrochetf, are liberally supplied with blood-vessels (bourgeons sanguins,) and are the most vascular part of this membrane. In the ordinary state of circulation and temperature during life these eminences are on a level with the surrounding corion; but when the surface is chilled this membrane shrinks, while * Recherches sur I'org.de lapeau, &c.

LYMrHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 225 his pupils, Hewson,*"Sheldon,! and Cruickshank^ in this country, and to those of Maseagni ยง in Italy, that the anatomical world are indebted for the complete examination and history of this system of vessels. The lymphatic vessels consist, in the members, of two layers, a superficial and a deep-seated one. The first is situate in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, between the skin and the aponeurotic sheaths, and accompanies the subcutaneous veins, or creeps in the intervals between them. A suc- cessful injection of these superficial lymphatics will show an extensive network of mercurial tubes surrounding the whole limb. The deep-seated layer of lymphatics is found chiefly in the interspaces between the muscles, and along the course of the arterial and venous trunks. In tracing both layers of lymphatics to the upper, fixed, or attached end of the members, we find they increase in volume, and diminish in number. At the connection of the members with the trunk, they are observed to pass through certain spheroi- dal or spherical bodies, termed lymphatic glands * Experimental Inquiries, Part the Second.

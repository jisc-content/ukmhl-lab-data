GENERAL ANATOMY. 420 gans is an accessory remote cause, which may ope- rate on the meningeal and cerebral circulation. Sd, The instances adduced as examples of this disease are at least ambiguous. The fourth case of Kirkland cannot be admitted. The case of Stark iv. p. 73,) I have already mentioned as one of injection either of the spinal chord or its membranes. The first case of Dr Powell might have been similar, for the spinal chord was not examined. * In other instances, as in that re- corded by Morgagni, (Epist. v. 17 and 19,) air in the meningeal vessels, and in the vascular sys- tem in general, might have been the cause of death. Mh, It has been shown by M. Serres, that many of the cases of supposed nervous apoplexy must have been examples of what he terms me- ningeal apoplexy, i. e. injection of the meningeal vessels, with or without effusion or extravasation. The first and fourth cases of Dr Abercrombie I am unable to explain. 5th, In other instances a very slight and incipient degree of the state which is to proceed to pulpy destruction may cause death. When it affects a whole hemisphere, which it may sometimes do, (Morgagni, Epist. v. 15, 16; h. 7, 11,) it may alter the appearance so little as readily to escape observation. For the reasons now assigned, it may be justly questioned whether there is ground for admitting such a state of the brain as the nervous apoplexy * Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. III. p. 102.

70 GENERAL ANATOMY. circumstances show that the melanose disease con- sists not in a degeneration or conversion into another substance, but in the deposition of a new form of matter in the manner of a secretion. In what form the melanose substance is first de- posited we have few accurate facts to enable us to form a judgment. Laennec is of opinion that it is first deposited in a solid form, and afterwards be- comes fluid. The former he considers the stage of crudity, the latter that of softening, {ramollisse- ment.) Several facts, however, would lead to the conclusion, that when first deposited it was fluid, and afterwards acquired consistency. Thus, in several dissections performed by Dr Cullen and Mr Carse- well, the matter of the small tumours, which are supposed to be of short duration, were found to be softest, and sometimes as fluid as cream. * In like manner, in a case recorded by M. Chomel, in which the disease was found in the liver in the shape of large cysts, the melanose matter was more fluid in the centre than in the circumference of the cysts, f Upon the whole, if the melanose deposite be as is supposed an inorganic secretion, the idea of its being poured forth from the vessels at first in a fluid or semifluid state is most probable, and most consistent with the usual phenomena and laws of animal processes. * Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edin- burgh, Vol. I. p. 264. f Noiivean Journal de Medecine, Tome III. p. 41.

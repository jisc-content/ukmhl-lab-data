Thus the lateral divisions called ventricles communicate freely and directly with each other below the vault or twain-band, (fornix^ Die Zwillingsbinde); the surface of which lies free over the top of the tJia- lami. These again communicate with the inter- mediate space called the third ventricle, from which it is well known there is a passage to the space between the medulla oblongata and the cere- bellum. The communication with the posterior and inferior divisions {cornua) is well known. The whole of this surface is covered by a vas- cular membrane, which is a continuation of that {pia mater) of the convoluted surface. One part of this which lies over the objects in the lateral ventricles has been long known under the name of choroid plexus; and an intermediate portion by which those of the two sides are united, has been distinguished by the term velum interpositum. Not only are each of these parts of the same mem- brane, and connected with the pia mater; but in- dividual portions of vascular membrane or choroid plexus, all continuous, are found in every division of the figurate surface of the brain. This mem- brane sustains the vessels going to and issuing from the cerebral substance. Between the two surfaces now described is placed the proper matter of the brain, which in different regions of the organ is arranged differ- ently. The intimate arrangement peculiar to in- dividual parts, and the manner in which the ar-

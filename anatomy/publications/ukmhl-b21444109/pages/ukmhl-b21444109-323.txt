301 BIIAIN. the microscopical observations of Sir Everard Home, * who has confirmed many of the facts ob- served by Delia Torre, are entitled to the utmost attention. The brain may be considered as a continuous organ consisting of three divisions ;—the convolu- ted, the laminated, and the smooth or uniform por- tions. Of these divisions, which are framed ac- cording to the peculiar external configuration of each, the first part corresponds to what is called the brain proper, {cerebrum;) the second to the small brain, (cerebellmn;) and the third to the oblong body contained in the vertebral column, and known under the name of spinal chord. The convoluted portion presents two surfaces, an outer or convoluted, and an inner or figurate. The laminated portion in like manner presents two surfaces, an outer or laminated, and an inner or » central. The third has only one exterior sur- face. The exterior surface of the convoluted division of the organ is formed into eminences longitudinal and rounded, but directed in various ways, and separated from each other by deep hollows. These eminences have been named convolutions or cir- cumvolutions, (gyri, Soemmering, Wenzel,) and the depressions sulci or furrows. This surface of the organ is most properly termed the convoluted surface. To see it distinctly, the vascular mem- brane termed pia mater, (meninx tenuis,) (Das * Phil.

280 GENERAL ANATOMY. the process of secretion; but what is the exact nature of this influence, or in what degree it takes place, is quite uncertain. This may be said to comprehend all that is accurately known regard- ing the uses of the nerves. Every other doctrine relating to sensibility, sympathy, irritability, &c. is either unfounded, not proved, or altogether ima- ginary and hypothetical. In the foetus the nerves are developed with re- markable perfection. I cannot speak from per- sonal observation much earlier than the sixth month, when I have found the nerves of the ex- tremities and voluntary muscles large and distinct. At the eighth month they are still more conspi- cuous. The anterior crural nerves are in the form of flat white cords one and a half line broad, and their branches like good sized threads. The scia- tic is still more distinct. In the form of a thick cylindrical cord, fully a line in diameter, and not unlike a piece of whip-cord, it is tough, stringy, and resists tension ; and its constituent threads are well-marked. I immersed a portion of this nerve three and a half inches long in aqua jpotas- scB, when it first became much firmer and denser than before, assumed in two days the satin fibrous appearance first described by Fontana, and at length by solution of the nervous matter was separated into chords and neurilematic canals. In this state, preserved in spirit of turpentine, it conveys a to- lerably correct idea of the arrangement of the neu- rilematic canals.

In a more chronic form I have seen it cut through both nasal bones by insensible ulcerative absorption. This process corresponds with the insensible ex- foliation or decomposition of Tenon ; the absorp- tion produced by tumoiirs, aneurisms, and other compressing agents ; (Louis, Wilmer ;) and the peculiar absorption described by Mr Russell. (Ed. Med. Chirurg. Tr. Vol. i. p. 74.) ^. A similar process, by causing suppurative destruction or even death of the periosteum, may kill the subjacent bone {necrosis,) which then be- comes white, yellow, or black, and presents a de- nuded but uniform surface, bounded at certain points by an irregular rough line, (crena.) This line, which denotes the establishment of ulceration on the confines of the living bone, becomes more com- plete and deeper, till the dead portion is loosened and removed. This process is denominated exfoliation, and the part so removed is said to be exfoliated. * By Weidmann,who justlyremarks that these terms are too limited, the process is designated by the general name of separation ; while the part sepa- rated is distinguished by the epithet ramentum. Though it takes place chiefly in the bones of the skull and in the front of the tibia, it may occur in the low- * Memoires sur I'Exfoliation des Os, par M.

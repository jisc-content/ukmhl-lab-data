And, Sd, In organs in which it contains no blood, the instances of which are, tendon, cartilage, liga- ment, hair, &c. Now, it is of little consequence to say that the tissues of the two last divisions contain other fluids than blood, when we are also told that the phe- nomena of injections, which prove that their ca- pillaries communicate directly with arteries con- veying red blood, the effect of irritating applica- tions mechanical or chemical, and the phenomena of acute or chronic inflammation, show that they may convey or receive red blood. The conclusion of this in common language is, that the capillary arteries and veins of the second order of tissues do not all contain red blood, but that many of them contain a colourless part of that fluid; and that all the capillary arteries and veins of the third order of tissues convey in the natural state co- lourless blood only. What then is the precise idea which ought to be formed of the intermediate system which Bichat conceived to exist between the minute arteries and veins, or what have been termed the venous radiculce P It appears that the present state of facts will admit of nothing more to constitute this capillary system than those minute vessels, whether con-

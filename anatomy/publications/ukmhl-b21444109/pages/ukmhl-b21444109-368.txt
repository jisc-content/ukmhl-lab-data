346 GENEllAL ANATOMY. belong to the convoluted surface. It is situate on the outside of the perforated spot, and corresponds with a short smooth convolution, which passes be- tween the middle and the anterior lobes. The un- ciform bundle, in short, unites these lobes, and is intimately connected* with the internal arrange- ment of the nucleus and its capsule, parts imme- diately to be noticed. The white cerebral matter is arranged in va- rious parts of the organ, in the form of incon- ceivably minute parallel lines, lying in juxtapo- sition. It is unnecessary to enumerate all the parts in which this arrangement may be ob- served ; and greater advantage will result from a short view of the mutual relation and connection of the fibrous parts of the organ, so far as they are weU ascertained. In tracing this part of the intimate structure of the brain, several anatomists have imbibed the no- tion that one part of the brain gives rise to or ge- nerates another. From this assumption even Reil, whose name I have occasion so often to mention with respect in this inquiry, is not wholly exempt. Without entering on the subject of organo-genesy, or the question of which part of the brain in the foetal existence is first, and which subsequently formed,—which will be considered in its own place—I begin with stating, that in the adult every part of the organ is supposed to be coeval; * Archiv. fiir die Physiologie, 9 ter Band, pp. IS*, 197, and 201.

322 GENERAL ANATOMY. lous body and vault are applied in the ordinary works, as if they were denominations of different objects, or rather of different bodies. If they are still to be retained, it ought to be stated, that they are names applied to opposite surfaces only of the same object. The relations of the round or posterior end of the middle band are worthy of examination. The handle of a scalpel inserted beneath it will be found to be in the middle ventricle, with the vault above, the conarium or pineal body, and four eminences of the upper surface of the protu- berance (corpora quadrigemma) below, and a part of each optic chamber on each side. I find it convenient to remove the posterior part of the hemispheres by a transverse section following the plane or level of the hinder end of the central band. A distinct view is thus given of this com- munication of the convoluted with the figurate surface ; and it may be observed, not only in the middle, but on each side. The middle one is bounded above by the posterior end of the middle band and the back part of the vault; below, by the pineal body and the four eminences ; before, it is continuous with the middle ventricle ; be- hind, it looks to that space between the convo- luted surface of the brain and the laminated sur- face of the cerebellum, which is occupied by the horizontal part (tentorium cerehelli) of the hard membrane. On the sides,â€”that is beyond the margin of

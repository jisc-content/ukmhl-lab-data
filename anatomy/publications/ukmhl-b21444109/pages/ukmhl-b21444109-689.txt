These mucous membranes pos- sess intrinsically certain vital properties independ- ently of the nervous filaments with which they are supplied ; and the principal use of these fila- ments appears to be to regulate these properties, especially that of secretion. The progressive developement of mucous mem- brane, and especially of its villi, has been studied by Meckel in the intestinal tube. This anatomist states, that in the beginning of the third month he first recognized them distinctly in the form of long plaits (Langenfalten) thickly set on the inner surface of the intestine, and scarcely indented on their free edge. The number and depth of these folds, and their indentations, are gradually increas- ed, till in the end of the fourth month, some- times sooner, in place of the simple long plaits, the observer may distinguish an irregular multi- tude of minute elevations, which become propor- tionally larger at a later period of foetal existence. He therefore infers that the villi are formed by the gradual indentation and decomposition (Zer- fallung) of simple longitudinal plaits. * The connection between the mucous membranes and the skin, I have elsewhere stated, was first well demonstrated by Bonn, who traces their mu- tual approximation and reciprocal transition into each other, and represents the former as an in- terior production of the latter enveloping the in- * Deiitches Archiv fiir die Physiologic von J.

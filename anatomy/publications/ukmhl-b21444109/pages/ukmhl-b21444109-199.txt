SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 177 muscles, of the cellular tissue, and of the skin, are affected nearly in the same degree. (Macartney, Cooke, &c.) An important question is to ascertain the pre- cise nature of this affection. The dissections of Pringle, Home, Ploucquet, Mills, &c, as to the brain, those of Schenck, Morgagni, Lieutaud, Sar- coni, and others, as to the thoracic organs, and those of Lieutaud, Petit and Serres, and Brous- sais, as to the intestinal canal, might favour the supposition that the morbid process of fe- ver consists in inflammation. Against this con- clusion, however, various facts and arguments may be adduced. 1*^, In fatal cases of fever unequivocal traces of inflammation are not uni- formly or invariably found. The proportion in which these marks, as albuminous effusion, sup- puration, ulceration, &c. are observed, is small compared with the number in which accumulation of blood in the capillaries, and more or less disor- ganization of these vessels are observed. 2c?, In cases of pure, genuine, and unmixed inflammation of the internal organs, whether spontaneous or from injury, the concomitant symptoms, though febrile, are totally different from those which dis- tinguish either intermittent or continued fever. 3c?, The marks or effects of inflammation which are found in the bodies of persons cut off by fever are accidental complications, and may almost invaria- bly be traced to inflammatory reaction supervening on the febrile process, in consequence either of the physical peculiarities of the individual, the local M

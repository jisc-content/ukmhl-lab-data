ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 91 miilated in the cellular tissue connecting the inner to the proper coat. It is perhaps of no great mo- ment to dispute this point; but I shall mention three facts, which show that the statement of MM. Jourdan and Breschet must be admitted with caution. 1*/, There is no cellular tissue be- tween the two membranes,* and the inner ad- heres simply to the proper coat. This is esta- blished, notwithstanding the authority of Haller, by dissection, and by observing the effects of ma- ceration and boiling. 9,dly, Calcareous deposi- tion is observed to take place at the semihmar valves, which consist of two folds of inner mem- brane, when it is found in no other part of the aorta, ^dhj^ Admitting, for the sake of argu- ment, that cellular tissue is placed between the inner coat and the proper arterial tissue, if cal- careous matter be deposited in it, it is not analo- gous to what is observed in this tissue elsewhere. Without relying much, however, on these facts, I shall state the ordinary mode in which the de- position appears, independent of any opinion as to its precise source. The calcareous incrustation commences invaria- bly at the outer surface of the inner membrane in the form of minute gritty points, or of small iso- lated patches. In the former state they appear to be hard and crystalline, and render the inside of * " La surface externe, foiblement unie a I'autre mem- brane, comme nous I'avons vu, n'a point un interraediare cellulaire."—.Bichat, Tome I. p. 29!■

308 GENERAL ANATOMY. furrows. It is scarcely requisite to say, that this definition is not meant to imply, that the direction of all these objects is the same throughout the whole organ,—but merely that the cerebellic plates, of which certain groups consist, observe the same direction ;—and that any one or two plates or leaves have several of the contiguous ones parallel or concentric with them, while those of the next group, though disposed differently, observe the same direction in relation to each other. By this peculiarity the various regions of the laminated or foliated surface of the small brain may be distinguished. The plates of the hemispheres are curvilinear and concentric, and pursue in various regions of the organ certain de- finite directions; those in the middle between the hemispheres are straight, transverse, and pa- rallel ; and at one spot they are oblique and pa- rallel. By means of these invariable characters of the cerebellic plates, the surface of the organ may be conveniently distributed into several divi- sions. To the cerebellic plates or their peculiarities, little attention was given before the time of Vin- cenzio Malacarne, professor of surgery in the city of Acqui, in the duchy of Montferrat. This learned person, the most diligent descriptive ana- tomist of his time, published in the year 1780 three Treatises on the Anatomy of the Brain ;* * Encefalotoraia Nuova Universale di Vincenzo Mala- carne, Saluzzese.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 142 and to minister to the various tissues and organs those supplies of blood which the several process- es of nutrition, secretion, &c. require ? The effects which the application of mechanical irritants, or chemical substances, as alcohol, acids, and alkaHs, produced in the experiments of Hun- ter, Wilson Philip, Thomson, and Hastings, have been supposed to demonstrate the irritable nature of the capillary vessels. The conclusion is illegi- timate, in so far as the results of these experiments are open to several sources of fallacy. In some instances these effects are to be ascribed to inci- pient inflammation, in others to shrivelling of the capillary structure, or crispation by chemical action, in others to actual coagulation of the blood of the capillaries ; but none of them prove satisfactorily or precisely any peculiar properties in the vessels of which the capillary system is composed. Section II. The morbid deviations incident to the system of capillary vessels are of the utmost importance. As they are the main agents of most of the healthy processes of the animal body, so there are few mor- bid states in which their operation is not primary, or in which they do not more or less partake. To enumerate these would form a long nosological list, since the diseases of ev^ry tissue depend chiefly, if not entirely, on its capillary system. It will be

The posterior end of the middle band penetrates into the substance of the hemispheres ; but the gray chords which we have already noticed, in pursuing their lateral course, are immediately enveloped in white plates, de- rived, as we shall see, from the sides of the vault, assuming thus a cylindrical appearance. Thus is formed exactly opposite to the cerebral limbs a body with a free rounded surface, which bends in a curvilinear direction laterally and downwards, and is found to be the great hippocampus or cylindroid process. (Chaussier.) In observing this curvili- near course, it rests on, and corresponds to, the upper margin of the cerebral limb, as it issues from the optic chamber. It must not, however, be imagined that it adheres to this body. The surfaces both of the beginning or upper end of hippocampus, and of the cerebral limb, are free and unconnected. They are indeed covered with vascular membrane, (pia mater) which keeps them in apposition; but if this be removed, as it ought always to be, the two surfaces will be found quite distinct, and in no manner connected, unless in corresponding with each other. The whole of this communication may be seen, and is best ex- amined by keeping the organ in its natural posi- tion, and viewing it from behind, after the poste- rior parts of the cerebral hemispheres have been removed. It forms what was described by Bi- chat under the name of the great cerebral fis-

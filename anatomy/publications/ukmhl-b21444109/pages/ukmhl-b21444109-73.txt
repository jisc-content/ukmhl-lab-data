FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 53 For these reasons he infers that cysts begin at first to be developed, and to grow in the midst of the filamentous tissue, according to laws analogous to those of the growth of parts in general, and which appear to be unknown aberrations, or un- natural applications of these laws.

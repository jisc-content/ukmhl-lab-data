567 BONE. rected the attention of surgeons to the process of regeneration; and about the same time the latter and Troja, and afterwards Blumenbach, Koeler, Macdonald, and Desault, investigated the manner in which this is effected. Two circumstances in the history of necrosis merit attention; first, the cause of the death of the bone; and, second, the agent of its reproduc- tion. 1 have already stated inflammation of the medullary web to be the cause of the former; and this I conceive to be proved not only by the phe- nomena of the disease, but more directly by the experiments of Troja, David, and others, who have performed experiments of the same descrip- tion. From these experiments it may be inferred, that suppurative destruction or death of the me- dullary web is necessarily followed by death of the surrounding bone. The same experiments, with the relative situ- ation of the new bone, unequivocally prove that the periosteum and its vessels are the agents of reproduction. Whether by accident or spontane- ously the medullary web is destroyed, if the peri- osteum be uninjured, it becomes thick, swollen, and highly vascular; bony matter is then depo- sited with more or less regularity from its interior surface; and after this has acquired a due degree of thickness, the vascularity and swelling of the peri- osteum gradually diminish, till the membrane is restored to its natural state. When, on the con- trary, the periosteum is injured or destroyed, re-

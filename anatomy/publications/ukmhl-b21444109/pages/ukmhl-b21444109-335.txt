BRAIN. 313 will be found to coincide about I2 inch, sometimes more, from the purse-like notch, with a consider- able furrow (the horizontal,) which turns round at the purse-like notch to meet the great furrow already mentioned. The curved outline thus con- tinued is the outer boundary of the posterior lobe; and it is easy to perceive, that, in consequence of the direction which this line observes, and its meeting with the great furrow, the lobe is con- tained between the horizontal and great furrow, or between two curved lines. This lobe is subdi- vided by Malacarne more minutely than the for- mer. It is found, however, that the number of lobules is not the same in both,â€”those of the left being most uniformly about eight, while those of the right are more numerous, but in general less distinctly marked. These with the central lobe, the general situa- tion of which has been already noticed, form the several divisions of the upper region of the cere- bellic laminated surface. The inferior region pre- sents divisions more numerous, more complicated, and more interesting. The first of these, the posterior-lower, is conti- guous, at its outer or greater boundary, with the posterior-upper lobe, where a small segment of it is seen when the cerebellum is examined from above. Its anterior or inner boundary is marked by a curvilinear furrow of moderate depth, by which it is separated from the slender lobe, and the posterior end of which terminates, not in the

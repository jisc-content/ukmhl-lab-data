LYMPHATIC GI.AND OR GANGIJON. 243 dient vessel corresponded. When the entrant lymphatic reaches the gland it splits into many- radiated branches, which immediately sink into its substance. The egredient lymphatics are ge- nerally larger than the entrants. The arrangement of these vessels in the inte- rior of the glands is best described by Mascagni, whose observations are confirmed by Gordon. To see this well, it is requisite to inject the entrant lymphatics of two glands in two different modes ; one with mercury, the other with wax, glue, or gypsum. After a successful mercurial injection, the entrants are seen, before sinking in the gland, to divide into two orders of branches. One of them, which belongs chiefly to the surface or circumfe- rence of the gland, consists of large vessels, bent, convoluted, and interwoven in every direction, communicating with each other, and swelHng out into dilated cells at certain parts, and of smaller vessels, which form a minute network on the sur- face, and which seem to terminate in the cells or distended parts of the larger vessels. From these distended parts or cells, again, arise many minute vessels, which, after winding about on the surface of the gland, unite gradually, and form the egredient vessels of the gland. The wax, glue, or gypsum injection is employ- ed to show the deep-seated or central vessels of the gland. The distribution of these is found to be quite the same as that of the superficial vessels. The cells delineated by Cruickshank, I am dis- posed to regard as mere dilated parts of the lyra-

791 SEROUS MEMBRANE. or converted into inarticulate muttering, but the patient is unable to maintain himself erect; and whenever he wills to make any motion, neither ai-ms nor legs are obedient to his desires. This morbid action of the cerebral membranes, in short, impairs, but does not annihilate the motions of all the voluntary muscles. It induces a general but incomplete loss of power. The senses are at the same time impaired but not oblite- rated. The paralytic madman distinguishes light from dark- ness ; he hears a loud sound made at the ears ; and he is sen- sible of pungent odours. But if the skin be touched with two bodies, the one hot and the other cold, he distinguishes no difference. Taste and general sensation are equally ob- tuse. In this state death is not remote. The duration of the aifection varies according to the slowness or rapidity of the meningo-encephalic disorder, from which the palsy arises. Some paralytic maniacs live eight months, a year, eighteen months, and others continue two or three years, rarely longer. The average duration of life, after the com- mencement of paralytic symptoms indicates affection of the cerebral surface, is about thirteen months. 2. Hemorrhage—Discharges of blood from the serous mem- branes have not attracted so much attention as those of the mucous surfaces. They are nevertheless not uncommon; and though the inaccessible situation of the serous surfaces has made their hemorrhages be overlooked or confounded with other diseases, they constitute a form of morbid action too important to be omitted. They occur in all the serous membranes, are preceded by injection, and take place by ex- halation, and may be arranged in the following order. Cerebral membi'anes, Menmgcemia. Pleura, Pleiircemia, Hcemathorax. Pericardium, Hcemacardia. Peritonaeum, Hcemenleria. Perididymis, Hcematorchis. Mcmngcemia.—The nature of the subject compels me re- 4

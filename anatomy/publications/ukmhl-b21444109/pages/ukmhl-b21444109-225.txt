SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 203 of this morbid accumulation belongs to the chapter on the serous membranes. That the capillary distension which takes place in fever is a frequent cause of anormal exhalation, is shown by the collections of limpid serum often found in the brain and spinal chord, by that some- times seen in the pericardium, and by the brownish watery fluid often found in the pleura in the bo- dies of persons cut off by any of the varieties of that disease. |8. The influence of impediment to the return of the venous blood in the production of extraordi- nary effusion has been known from the earliest periods of medicine. In proof of this I shall not adduce the experiment of Lower, who, by tying the vena cava in a dog, produced dropsy in a few hours ; for the injury in such a case may produce inflammation of the peritoneum, and consequent effusion ; and Hewson has justly objected to its competency, that the ligature might have included lymphatics along with the venous trunk. * Nor is it requisite to notice the experiments of Peyer, Bontekoe, and others. It is sufficient to say, that the fact is established by the effects of deranged circulation, as they take place, j^/**/, in veins ; se- condly, in arteries ; and, thirdly, in both sets of vessels jointly, or in the capillary system. To the first head are to be referred tumours in the vicinity, or affecting the substance of veins; * Experimental Inquiries, Part ii. by William Hev/son, F. R. S. London, 1774, p. 142.

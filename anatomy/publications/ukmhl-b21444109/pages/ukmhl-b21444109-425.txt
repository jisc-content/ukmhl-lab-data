The latter process, if we admit the testi- mony of Cheselden, * Morgagni, f and Willan, ^ takes place in the slow and gradual drowsiness and stupefaction which distinguish the form of the disease termed lethargy. (vetertius.) ^ The cause of the symptoms, however, is not the effu- sion as Willan imagined, but the general vascular distension and injection from which the effusion arises. Hemorrhage, nevertheless, takes place in a con- siderable proportion of cases. Howship says in nine of ten ; but this is evidently a general asser- tion, founded on no accurate elements. From the distended vessels blood escapes, though whether by exhalation or by actual rupture is not agreed; and, forcing its way through the cerebral sub- stance, breaks it down, and forms a sort of hol- low or cavern, in which it coagulates. If the quantity be considerable ; if it be effused sudden- ly, and in certain parts of the brain ; (optic tha- lamus, annular protuberance, brain-limbs, and medulla oblongata;) if the cerebral injection con- tinues, notwithstanding the discharge and the use of remedies, complete coma very soon terminates in death ; and on dissection more or less blood is * The Anatomy of the Human Body.

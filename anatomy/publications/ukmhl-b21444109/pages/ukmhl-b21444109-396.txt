GENERAL ANATOMY. 374 denominated convolutions, and the cerebellum its laminated or foliated appearance. In the early weeks of existence the brain is fluid, soft, and homogeneous. The white matter and its fibrous structure is first seen; and the cross structure of the fibres of the pyramids are observ- able about the eighth week, according to M. Ser- res. About the sixth month the cerebral sub- stance appears, when microscopically examined, to consist of globules immediately beneath the pia mater, and of fibres at a greater depth. In the seventh month a section of the ventricles shows very distinct layers of radiating fibres. After these are seen new ones, which form convolutions, and which are termed converging fibres. At the ninth month the organization is complete. The gray substance appears a long time after the white. At the end of the sixth or seventh month this substance is formed in the olivary eminences, which then assume their proper ap- pearance ; about the end of gestation the spinal chord is also filled with gray matter, and about the ninth month this substance is distinctly seen in the convolutions, the plates of the cerebeUura, &c. These results are much like those of Serres, unless as to what regards the brain proper, in which, accoi'ding to this anatomist, the optic cham- bers and striated bodies consist originally of gray substance entirely, to which white cerebral matter is afterwards added. Of the process of growth, the principal, indeed

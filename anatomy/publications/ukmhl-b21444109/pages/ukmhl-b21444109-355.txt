BRAIN. 333 hemispheres. The portion thus separated will, however, still adhere by the sides to the substance of the hemispheres ; and other incisions must be made, following the direction of the outer or la- teral margin of the striated bodies (corpora stri- ata ) and the optic chambers (thalami optici,) un- til the whole be completely insulated. If these incisions be properly managed, the whole of the middle band, the vault, the cylindroid process, and the Avhite tape, will be left uninjured, and will present a large hollow surrounded by an ex- tensive border, the posterior part of which is made by the posterior end of the central band, while lateral divisions are formed by the cylin- droid process of either side. The observer will likewise form a very just idea of the situation and connections of the middle band, and will perceive that its inferior surface is the same as that named vaiilt or ceiling. He will further remark, that the thin white plates (tcenice) which are attached to the margins of this object, and between which is the space improperly named the lyi^e, extend in a circular and revolute direction outwards and downwards, so as to cover, in the mode described, the gray band of the cylinder, and give this ob- ject its cylindrical aspect. The correct understanding of the outer border of this communication should be followed by an equally just idea of those parts which form what we must name its inner border. These are more numerous and rather more complicated ; but fre-

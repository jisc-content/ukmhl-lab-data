GENERAL ANATOMY. 186 taught by Vesalius, Iiigrassias, and Mali)ighi, and more positively stated regarding these vessels by Hunter ; and modern researches have sho^vn it to be completely erroneous. Cuvier and Ribes in France, Mascagni, Paul Farnese, Moreschi in Italy, and Tiedemann in Germany, have shown that there are no cells or spongiform stnicture in the erectile tissue of the cavernous body. The first correct view of the structure of parts of this description in the human subject was given by Mascagni in his account of the arterial and venous communications in the Spongy Body of the Urethra. In 1787 he announced in his work on the Lymphatics, that the parts called ca- vernous bodies, both in the penis and in the clifo- ris, were simply fasciculi, or accumulations of ar- terial and venous vessels without interruption of canal; but that between the arteries and veins of the spongy bodies a dilated cavity or minute cell was interposed. In 1795 repeated minute injec- tions led him to doubt the existence of this sort of cell; and about the close of 1805 he publicly de- monstrated the fact, that many veins of consider- able calibre collected in the manner of a plexus, with corresponding arteries, but small and less numerous, really form the outer and inner mem- branes of the urethra, the whole of the gla?ispe?iis,- and the whole substance of the spongy body. In each of these parts, and also in the spongy struc- ture inclosing the orifice of the vagina, he ascer- tained by repeated injections that there are no

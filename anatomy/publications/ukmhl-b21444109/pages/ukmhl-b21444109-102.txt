82 GENERAL ANATOMY A branch issuing from a trunk generally forms with it a particular angle. Most generally, per- haps, these angles are acute ; but in particular si- tuations they approach nearly to a right angle. Thvisiheinnominata, left carotid and left subclavian issue from the arch of the aorta nearly at a right angle, at least to the tangent of the arch. The in- tercostals form a right angle with the thoracic aor- ta ; the renal and lumbar arteries form a large acute angle, approaching to right with the abdo- minal ; and the coeliac comes off nearly in the same manner from the anterior part of the vessel. The internal and external carotids, again, the ex- ternal and internal iliacs, the branches of the hu- meral, and those of the femoral, form angles more or less acute with each other. The angle which the spermatics make is, generally speaking, the most acute in the arterial system. I have already alluded to the structure of the arterial tissue at the divarications. These changes relate both to the inner and to the proper mem- brane. In the inside of the vessel the inner mem- brane is folded somewhat so as to form a promi- nent or elevated point, the disposition of which varies according to the angle of divarication. 1^^ When this is rectangular, the prominence of the inner membrane is circular, and is equally distinct all round. 2d, When the angle is obtuse, as in the mesenteric artery, the prominence is distinct, and resembles a semicircular ridge, between the continuation of the trunk and the branch given off,

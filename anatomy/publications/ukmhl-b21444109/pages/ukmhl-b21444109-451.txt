429 BRAIN. a. When it is seated in the upper or cranial portion of the chord, {medulla oblongata,) the ef- fects are more or less disorder of the senses, locked- jaw, gnashing of the teeth, impaired articulation and deglutition, respiration oppressed, disordered, and panting, palsy, and death by asphyxia. When it is seated in the cervical portion it gives rise to tetanic rigidity, convulsion, or palsy of the muscles of the neck, more or less palsy of the intercostals, and muscles of the trunk and extremities in general, paralytic weakness of the diaphragm, and eventually, as this advances, death by suspension of the mechanical agents of respira- tion. In the dorsal region it induces convulsive throes of the trunk, palsy of the intercostal muscles, with short, languid, diaphragmatic respiration, palpita- tion, and irregular throbbing of the heart, hiccup, squeamishness, vomiting, and eventually death, partly by impaired respiration, partly by failure of the action of the heart. In the lumbar region palsy of the lower extre- mities is always a prominent symptom ; but to this are added paralytic retention of urine at first, afterwards incontinence and involuntary voiding of the contents of the rectum. |3. The transverse diameter of the chord is so small, that in general the capillary injection and its consequences are not confined to one side only. When this happens, however, which is rare, it produces hemiparaplegia, or palsy of the lower

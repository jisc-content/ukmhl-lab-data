BRAIN. 369 still the atomic constitution of different parts of the brain and cerebellum has been investigated by- Sir Everard Home, aided by the powerful micro- scopes of M. Bauer. According to this observer, white cerebral mat- ter consists of innumerable globules, aggregated or connected in rows, so as to constitute fibres, by means of a transparent, colourless, jelly-like mat- ter, somewhat viscid, elastic, and readily soluble in water. The globules are whitish, semitranspa- rent, and vary from 25*00 to lo^oo of an inch in diameter, the average being 0. Upon different proportions of these two consti- tuent elements, and partly upon differences in size of the component globules, the chief peculi- arities of structure in the several sorts of cerebral substance depend. Thus the gray matter of the convoluted surface of the brain, and the laminated surface of the cerebellum, consists chiefly of glo- bules from 3 2^0 0 to 4 0^0 0 of an inch in diameter, the smaller globules being most numerous, of a large proportion of the gelatinous, elastic, viscid substance, and a yellowish fluid resembling the serum of the blood, probably albuminous. In the white matter, on the contrary, the large globules (40^00 of an inch) predominate ; the connecting jelly is more tenacious, but less abundant in pro- portion to the globules ; and the latter are more distinctly arranged in rows, so as to constitute fibres.

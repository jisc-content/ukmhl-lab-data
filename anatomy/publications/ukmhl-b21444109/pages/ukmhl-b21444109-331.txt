309 BRAIN. in the third of which he describes with much pre- cision and minuteness, the anatomical characters of the outer or laminated surface of the cerebel- lum. Some knowledge of his distinctions, which were adopted by Reil, is requisite to comprehend distinctly the configuration and structure of this part of the organ. Commencing with the well known division of the whole organ into two hemispheres, Malacarne remarks, that, if the whole upper surface of the organ be presented to the eye, the outline of each hemispherical surface is found to describe three- fourths of a circle ; and as these circular segments mutually meet towards the mesial plane, where they are respectively adapted to different parts, the mode of union varies according to the figure of these adjoining objects. 1st, As the hemi- spherical border approaches the anterior part of the organ, it is found to be suddenly interrupted, where the cerebellic branches or peduncles f crura cerebelli) are connected with the protuberance ; and, pursuing a retrograde direction on each side towards the mesial plane, forms a species of re- entrant curvature. The hollow thus formed, which corresponds to the lower of the four emi- nences on the upper surface of the protube- rance (corpora quadrigemina. Die Vierhugel,) is named by Malacarne the semilunar curvature, â€”(der halbmondformige asschnitt; Reil.) ^d. Again, as the hemispherical borders approach the posterior part of the small brain, advan-

NERVOUS TISSUE. 271 glion. But he was not enabled by any means, mechanical or chemical, to ascertain their exact nature. The ganglions are well supplied with blood- vessels, derived in general from the neighbouring arteries. The intimate distribution is represented by Wutzer to be the following. The artery pro- ceeding to a ganglion gives vessels to the fila- mentous tissue ; and, perforating the proper coat, is immediately ramified into innumerable minute canals, the first order of which forms vascular nets on the inner surface of the tunic ; while the residual twigs penetrate the flocculent texture, and the individual vesicles of the secondary or filamen- tous matter of the ganglion. * This short exposition of the structure of the ganglions shows the mistaken notions of John- stone, Unzer, Bichat, and others, on the struc- ture and uses of these bodies. 1*^, The idea first advanced by Johnstone,-f and Unzer, t adopted by Metzger, ยง Hufeland, || Prochaska, ^ * De Corporis Humani Gangliorum Fabrica, &c. cap. ii. ยง 41. f Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LIV.

BRAIN. 347 that the idea of one part generating or reinforcing another is an effort of fancy which must not be ad- mitted in strict scijence ; that when a bundle of fibres, or a fibrous arrangement, is seen proceed- ing from one part to another, it is imagination only which suggests that the former produces the latter, or conversely ; and that from this nothing more can be inferred than that the parts so ar- ranged are mutually and generally connected. The inner fibrous part of the brain proper is divided by Reil into the system of the brain-limbs {crura;â€”Das Hirnschenkel-system ;) the system of the beam or mesolobe, (Das-Balken system;) and the striated ganglion (das gestreifte Hirngan- glion ;) and to one or other of these he refers the arrangement of all the other parts of which the organ is composed. I do not adopt all his views, nor is it requisite to follow his distinctions mi- nutely. But I shall attempt to trace briefly what I conceive admits of demonstrable proof. The beam or mesolobe {corpus callosum, Der Balken) consists of white cerebral matter disposed in transverse fibres, which meet on the mesial plane, and thus give rise to the longitudinal lines seen on its upper surface {Raphe externa et inter- nay Reil.) They appear to change direction, and bend down at right angles, parallel with those of the opposite half. At the distance of from four to five lines on each side, these transverse fibres un- dergo a similar interruption or change of direc- tion, so as to form the covered bands (die bedeck-

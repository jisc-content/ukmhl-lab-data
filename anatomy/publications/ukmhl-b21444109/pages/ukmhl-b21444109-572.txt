550 GENERAL ANATOMY. process coramences, a new train of phenomena takes place with the primary teeth. The follicu- lar sacs of the new or permanent teeth are libe- rally supplied with vessels for the purpose of nu- trition ; and as these blood-vessels increase in size, those of the temporary teeth diminish ; and the supply of blood being thus cut off, the latter un- dergo a sort of natural death. The roots which, as being last formed, are not unfrequently incom- plete, now undergo a process of absorption; and the tooth drops out in consequence of the destruc- tion of its nutritious vessels. Some authors* have ascribed this expulsion to pressure, exercised by the new tooth. They forget, however, that be- fore the new tooth can exert any pressure, it must be in some degree formed; and to this a vasc^it- lar system is indispensable. -' The increased number of the teeth when per- manent, the enlargement of the jaws, and the con- sequent expansion of the face, though interesting, are foreign to the present inquiry. Another part of the osseous system requiring notice are the sesamoid bones. These derive their name, it is well known, from their minuteness, {ariaai^n, a grain,) most of them, excepting the knee-pan, being of the size of a grain or pea. They are confined to the extremities, and are si- tuate chiefly in positions in which they give points of support to the tendons of the flexor muscles.

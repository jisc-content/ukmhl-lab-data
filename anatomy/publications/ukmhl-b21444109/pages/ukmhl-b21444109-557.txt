535 BONE. bone. This view is only partially correct. The large vessels termed nutritious certainly proceed chiefly to the cavity of the bone, and are distri- buted in the medullary membrane. These, how- ever, are not the only vessels which proceed to this part of the bone. First, I have often traced several lai'ge vessels, entering not by the middle, but Ihe ends of the long bones, into the loose can- cellated texture, and actually distributed on the medulla in this part of the bone. In dried bones also the canals of these vessels may be demon- strated extending from the surface to the body of the bone. Secondly, the nutritious vessels are not constant; and when they are wanting, those of the ends of the bone, or of the cancelli, are much larger and more numerous than in ordinary circumstances. The communication between these and the branches of the nutritious vessels, which is admitted by Bichat, may be easily demonstrated. The third order of vessels are those which may be termed periosteal, in so far as they consist of an infinite number of minute capillaries, some red, some colourless, proceeding from the perios- teum to the bone, and contributing to maintain the connection between the two. The short bones and the flat bones, which are destitute of nutri- tious arteries, receive blood from the two latter orders, but principally from the periosteal vessels. In the skull these vessels are often highly in- jected in apoplectic subjects, and in persons killed by drowning or strangulation,

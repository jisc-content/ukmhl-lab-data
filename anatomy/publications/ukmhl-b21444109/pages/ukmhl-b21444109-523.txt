MUSCULAR TISSUE. 501 muscular organs, the most important example is that of rupture of the muscular substance of the heart. Instances of this have been collected by Morand,* Morgagni, f Haller, ^ Portal, ยง Brera, || Baillie, IJostan, ^ Blaud, Rochoux, ff and Adams. According- to the results obtained by these observers rupture of the heart is most frequent in the left ventricle, which gives way by a longitu- dinal fissure near the base and middle of the ven- tricle. In most of the cases, this rupture may be traced to previous ulceration, (Morgagni, Haller, Portal, Brera, &c.) and appears to be the result of the ulcerative process advancing from one sur- face of the ventricle to the other. Of rupture of the right ventricle too little is known to deter- mine whether it be also the result of ulceration or not. So far, therefore, as is hitherto known, la- ceration of the muscular substance of the heart is not so much the consequence of being violently or forcibly torn, as of its being previously wasted, extenuated, and weakened. Transverse laceration of muscular fibres, or forcible detachment from the tendons, may happen in consequence of external violence. This was * Mem. de I'Acad.

DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 7 to liim for many of the facts of which anatomy at the present day consists. The labours of these ingenious and indefatiga- ble inquirers added considerably to the stock of accurate knowledge, and tended to diffuse a taste for correct observation in the study of the minute structure of the parts of the animal body. Not much, however, had been done for the arrange- ment of the materials thus collected. Though many isolated facts had been established, and se- veral curious discoveries had been made, they were not yet digested in that systematic order which renders them useful to the purposes of pathology. It is in the great work of Haller that we re- 1757. cognize the first traces of a better spirit and more philosophical views. This accomplished scholar and indefatigable observer was the first who at- tempted to present, in a collected form, the most correct information on the intimate structure of the animal tissues. Assiduous in his cultivation of anatomy, and deeply impressed with the neces- sity of accuracy in research, Haller scrutinized with the eye of rigorous observation evezy jioint in anatomical structure advanced by his predeces- sors and contemporaries. In his description of the cellular web, of the adipose membrane, of ar- terial texture, of the veins, of the structure of the heart, of that of the brain and nerves, of the lungs, of the minute structure of the muscles, of the membranes, and of the organs in general, the read- er perceives, that, while Haller did not disdain to

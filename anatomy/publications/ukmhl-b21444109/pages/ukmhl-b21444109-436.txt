GENERAL ANATOMY. 414 second is the tendency which the arterial sys- tem more especially betrays to become diseased after the meridian of life. The proofs of the existence of venous plethora, and the theory of its operation, may be found in Cullen, who, per- haps, overrated its influence. There is little doubt that the circulation in the veins, either in consequence of diminished pressure, and tension of the skin and other coverings, does not go on with the same perfection and facility which it does in early life. But whether there is a greater venous plethora in the head at that period than before or not seems doubtful. There is reason to believe, that the fulness resides as much in the arteries as in the veins. Of the effect and reality of arterial disease I have spoken already. In point of fact, cases of apoplexy occur at all ages, but are most frequent between the 50th and the 65th, or 70th year. Willan informs us he has seen young persons from 12 to 18 years of age affected with apoplexy and hemiplegia. In Bone- tus and Morgagni, instances of apoplexy are found occurring in persons below the age of 30 ; but in general they were induced by external violence or organic diseases. I have seen an instance of cere- bral hemorrhage terminating in hemiplegy in a young man of 19, labouring under disease of the left auriculo-ventricular orifice. The young woman to whose case I have already alluded, was, I think, about 22. Of eighteen cases described by Bo- netus, five occurred in persons above 60, and

GENERAL ANATOMY. 72 from repeated examination of the arteries of the human subject, occasionally compared with those of the more familiar domestic animals. Every arterial tube greater than one line in diameter is visibly composed of one adventitious and two essential substances. The first, the sheath, reputed to consist of condensed filamentous tissue; the two last, the proper arterial and in- ternal tissues. (Ttmica propria et membrana intima.) 1. The inner surface of the arterial tube is formed by a very thin semitransparent polished membrane, which is said to extend not only in the one direction over the inner surface of the left ventricle, auricle, and pulmonary veins, but in the other to form the minute vascular terminations which are distributed through the substance of the different organs. This membrane is particu- larly described by Bichat under the name of com- mon membrane of the system of red hlood, because he believed it to exist wherever red blood was moving,â€”in the pulmonary veins, in the left side of the heart, and over the entire arterial system. The inner membrane may be demonstrated by cutting open or inverting any artery of moderate size, when it may be peeled off in the form of thin slips by the forceps. Or, if the tube be fitted on a glass rod, by removing the layers of the proper membrane in successive portions, the inner one at length comes into view in the form of a thin tran- slucent pellicle, of uniform, homogeneous aspect.

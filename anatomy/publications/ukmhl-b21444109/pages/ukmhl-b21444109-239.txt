SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 217 breast of a lady; * and Montini saw it in the thigh of a woman in childbed at Lodi. f From the united testimony of these observers, it appears that the blood-cyst (licematoma), is a tumour consisting of a membranous sac, the inner surface of which is liberally supplied with blood- vessels, from which blood, or a bloody fluid, is incessantly oozing or distilling by exhalation. In some instances this fluid contains a proportion of fibrin sufficient to effect coagulation ; and the interior of the cyst then resembles the spleen or a mass of clotted blood. From aneurism it may be distinguished by the following marks ; that it does not throb; that it contains a fluid ; that it is surrounded by bluish tortuous veins ; and that it is dark or purple-coloured, while the investing skin is transparent. When seated in the neck, however, near the carotid artery, it may derive from it, or from the subclavian, a pulsating mo- tion, which may give it the appearance of aneu- rism. Its ordinary locality is easily understood from what has been already said. It occurs most usual- ly in the filamentous tissue of the arm-pit and neck, in the substance of the thyroid gland, and at the knee. (Monteggia.) Zeller describes it as it appears in the brain of infants, under the name of cefJialcematoma. Dr Hooper has represented * Treatise on the Anatomy, &c. Appendix, p. 456.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 56 them. If the temperature of a portion of adipose membrane be raised by means of warm water to the liquefying point of the contents, they will re- main unmoved So long as the structure of the vesicles is not injured by the heat. If, again, an adipose i^eloton be exposed to a solar heat of + 40 centigr. though the fat be completely lique- fied, not a drop will escape, until the vesicles are divided or otherwise opened, when it appears in abundance. The adipose matter, therefore, though fluid or semifluid in the living body, does not, like dropsical infiltration, obey the impulse of gra- vity. The adipose vesicles do not form, like cellular tissue, a continuous whole, but are simply in mutual contiguity. This arrangement is demon- strated by actual inspection, but becomes more con- spicuous in the case of dropsical effusions, when the filamentous tissue interposed between the adipose molecules is completely infiltrated, while the latter are entirely unaffected, ^d. The ana- tomical situation of the adipose tissue is different from that of the filamentous tissue. The former is found, \st. In a considerable layer immediately beneath the skin; Between the peritoneal folds which form the omentum and mesentery; 36?, Between the serous and muscular tissues of the heart; and, 4^//, Round each kidney. In each of these situations it varies in quantity and in physical properties. In the least corpulent persons a portion of fat is deposited in the adi- pose membrane of the cheeks, orbits, palms of the

544 GENERAL ANATOMY. tinct osseous appearance and arrangement, and bear no resemblance to cartilage. In short, true bone seems never at any period of its growth to be cartilaginous. The period at which ossification may be said to be completed varies doubtless in different individuals. It may be said to be indicated by the completion of the medullary canal, by the os- sification of the epiphyses, and their perfect union with the osseous cylinder, (diaphysis.) The first circumstance is always indefinite. The two latter, though more fixed, are still liable to great variation. The epiphyses are rarely united be- fore the age of 14 or 15; and they may continue detached till the 20th or 211st year. I preserved the greater part of the skeleton of a man who stated himself to be about 28, and in whose bones the epiphyses are still imperfectly united, and many have dropped off". In general, however, they begin to unite, or to be knit, as is said, be- tween the 15th and 210th years. Little doubt can be entertained that the main agents of original ossification are the periosteum and the periosteal arteries. The proofs of this inference are manifest. The formation of bone has never been ascribed but to the vessels of two agents,â€”the periosteum and the medullary mem- brane. That the latter cannot be concerned in the production of bone in the foetus must be inferred from the fact, that at that period it cannot be said to have existence. To the periosteum, there- 3

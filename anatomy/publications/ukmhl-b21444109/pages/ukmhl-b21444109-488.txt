GENERAL ANATOMY. 466 tie hard, that no precise idea is communicated by it. In the brain especially all authors have comprehend- ed, under this general appellation, every change of texture which was harder than that of the sur- rounding organ, without much regard to the ana- tomical characters of the new substance. Hence we find aU the instances already adduced record- ed as examples of scirrhus, though in many of them no proof of this structure is given, and in none is there any other proof than the greater consistence of the part. Without attempting to define the character of scirrhus when occurring in the brain, I refer to the present head those instances of morbid struc- ture in which, with hardness approaching to that of cartilage, there is a fibrous arrangement, and more or less tendency to cancerous ulceration. Even with this limitation it may be doubted whe- ther this disease occurs primarily in the cerebral substance. Meanwhile, however, for want of more satisfactory elements in the arrangement of the organic changes incident to the brain, to this head may be referred the following examples:— M. Jean Cruveilhiei", Essai sur rAnatomie Pathologique^ Tome ii. p. 80. Paris, 1816.—A woman of 40 was brought to the Hotel-Dieu in a state of idiocy, in which she was stated to have been for six months after severe mental distress. She lived a month without much sign of intellect, became comatose and died. In the right hemisphere, beneath the mesolobe, corresponding to the striated body on the out- side, and projecting into both ventricles, was found a hard tumour of a triangular shape, the posterior angle elonga- ted, the right anterior angle advancing to the anterior ex- 3

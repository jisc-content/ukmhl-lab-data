GENERAL ANATOMY. 250 fest themselves first in the skin and cellular mem- brane ; and it may therefore be thought that the disease belongs properly to these tissues. Their affection, nevertheless, is, so far as can be deter- mined, the result of the previous state of the glands, which appear to be directly killed either by the syphilitic poison, or the mercurial action, and thus to give rise to the violent process of disorga- nization, which then takes place in the skin and cellular membrane. Enlargement of the mesenteric glands has been supposed by most authors to be the anatomical chai'acters of the disease termed mesenteric wast- ingâ€”Tabes mesenterica; Tabes glandularis. (Wharton, Bastivi, Richard, Kussell.) Without absolutely denying this, I shall afterwards show, that, in most instances of that disease, the enlarge- ment of the glands is secondary to some morbid state either of the intestinal villous membrane, or of some of the intestinal tissues. 4. Enlargement and Induratmi, (Vascular Sarcoma.) Either after repeated attacks of inflam- mation, alternating with resolution, or with a slow and indistinct form of the disease, a gland, or a cluster of glands gradually enlarges, and, resisting all means of resolution, becomes unusually hard. This continues, or is liable to slight occasional ag- gravations, with dull pain in the substance or in the neighbourhood of the gland. Though such enlargement may be termed strumous, and may have originated in what is termed strumous ac- tion, the structure of the gland or glands is so

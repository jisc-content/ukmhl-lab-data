This division, to which I have already adverted in speaking of encysted tumours in the cellular tissue, is nevertheless imperfect; and indeed no distinct and connected arrangement of all the va- rieties of encysted tumour has yet been given, un- less the seventh genus of the system of Plenck be entitled to this character. * Without attempting to specify the individual defects of the classifica- tion of this surgeon, I conceive I am justified in asserting, that one more strictly pathological may be given. Considered as examples of inordinate exhala- tion without corresponding absorption, the species of encysted tumour may be enumerated in the fol- lowing order. a. Hydatids are cysts secreting limpid watery fluid. They have been commonly believed to be living animals.

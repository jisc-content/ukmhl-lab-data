LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 227 brustrohre, canal thoracique) is situate on the left side of the dorsal vertebrae. It receives the lymphatics of the lower extremities, of the beUy, and the parts contained in it; those of great part of the chest, and those of the left side of the head, neck, and trunk, and left upper extremity. The other lymphatic trunk, which is situate on the right side of the upper dorsal vertebrae, is formed by the union of the lymphatics of the right side of the head, neck, right upper extremity, and some of those of the chest. Both of these trunks, it is well known, open into the subclavio-jugular vein of each side. That lymphatics terminate in branches of the venous system has been asserted on the authority of various observers. Steno, for instance, states that he traced the lymphatics from the right side of the head, the chest, and pectoral extremity in animals into the right axillary vein; and he gives delineations of anastomotic connections of several lymphatics with the axillary and jugular veins. Similar facts have been reported by Nuck, Richard Hale, Bartholin, and Hartmann. Ruysch traced the lymphatics of the lung into the sub- clavian and axillary veins; Drelincourt those of the thymus gland in animals into the subclavians ; and Hebenstreit saw those of the loins pass into the vena azygos. Haller, though unwiUing to deny the testimony of these observers, regards it liable to various sources of fallacy, and doubts the direct com-

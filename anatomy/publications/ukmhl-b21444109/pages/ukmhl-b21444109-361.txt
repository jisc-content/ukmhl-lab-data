339 BRAIN. admitting the point of a small probe, is found at the inner or mesial edge of the tracts; but be- yond this they adhere indissolubly. As they pur- sue their course backward and outward, they reach the limbs of the brain, the inferior surface of which they cross, still adhering by their outer edge, but more extensively. Here likewise they are sensibly broader than at their anterior end. When they have passed completely the limbs of the brain, at which they are about the breadth of three lines, they begin to present a linear fur- row or depression, which extends in their long direction about one-half or three-fourths of an inch, and thus divides the tract into an outer and an inner limb. This depression, however, does not divide the tract equally, but leaves the outer broader than the inner limb. It is insensibly ter- minated at the upper surface of the optic emi- nence or chamber; and its last part (about three or four lines,) contemplated with care, will be found to separate two spheroidal eminences which are respective terminations of the outer and inner limbs of the tract. The outer of these eminences i^ the largest and most prominent, and is the body mentioned by authors as the posterior tubercle of the optic chamber. It is the body which Santo- rini named the geniculate {corpus quiddam geni- culatum) ;â€”an epithet for which it is not easy to account, unless we suppose that his fancy had likened it to the appearance of a bent joint, espe- cially that of the knee, to which, if viewed late-

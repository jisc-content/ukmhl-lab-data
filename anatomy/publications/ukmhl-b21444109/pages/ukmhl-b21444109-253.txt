LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 2S1 the observations of Cruickshank, (Chap, xii.) which have been verified by Bichat, the thoracic duct presents, 1st, a layer of dense firm filamentous or cellular tissue, exactly similar to that found in- closing arterial and venous tubes, which the lat- ter regards as foreign to the vessel, but giving it a great degree of support and protection; 2d, a proper membrane, delicate, transparent, and mois- tened inside by an unctuous fluid, which he seems inclined to ascribe to transudation. Muscuh r fibres, of which Sheldon speaks positively, Cruick- shank represents, though seen in some instances, (Chap xii.) yet to be more generally not demon- strable. Their existence, though admitted by Schreger and Soemmering, is denied by Mascagni, Rudolphi, and J. F. Meckel, and, I may add, by Bichat and Beclard. This account differs not much from that of Dr Gordon, who could not re- cognize distinctly more than one coat, similar to the inner coat of veins. The filamentous layer noticed by Bichat, and considered by Mascagni as an external coat, is of course excluded. The knotted or jointed appearance of lymphatics is occasioned chiefly by short membranous folds in their cavity called valves. Tiiese folds are thinner than the venous valves; but they are equally strong, and have the same shape and mode of attachment to the inside of the vessel. They are generally found in pairs, but never three at the same point. A single valve is sometimes found at the junction of a large branch with a trunk, or of a trunk with Â«

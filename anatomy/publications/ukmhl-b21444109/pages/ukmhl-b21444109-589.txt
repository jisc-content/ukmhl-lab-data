BONE, 565 rather dilatation of the bone, takes place, while the bone, though its texture is softened, is still alive. This is the process which Scarpa distin- guishes under the name of expa7ision, and in which he imagines the reticular structure to be relaxed or unfolded. The fact is well established, but the explanation is gratuitous. It is doubtless the early stage of the process which terminates in necrosis. Suppuration in the cavity of the long bones, which was seen by Cheselden, (p. 40,) Gooch, (vol, ii. p. 357,) Hey, (p. 26 and 32,) and others, is ge- nerally a process so severe as to cause death by constitutional irritation. If it fails to effect this, it first distends and softens the bone, and then kills it from within outwards, inducing necrosis. This may affect either part or the whole of the diaphysis, which is then separated from the peri- osteum and epiphysis, which is rarely killed. In process of time the dead portion or portions {ra- menta,) become enclosed more or less completely by a thick shapeless cylinder of new bone, with or without openings in its sides, and which is placed between the epiphyses and covered by the peri- osteum, which is much thickened. If death take place at this period, the bone thus formed is found to contain the original shaft, loose and dead. If life be still prolonged, the old bone generally piecemeal is gradually brought to the surface through the openings in the new osseovis case and expelled. The fragments thus discharged, which are of a dirty yellow, drab, or black colour, and some-

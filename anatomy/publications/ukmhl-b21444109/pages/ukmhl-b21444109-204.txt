182 GENERAL ANATOMY. a bruise, for example, blood and lymph being- pour- ed forth, instead of being absorbed, become i)ene- trated with vessels, which conversely are stimu- lated by the presence of this substance to convey more blood, and thus enlarge in size. In others this local capillary developement commences with- out obvious cause. Upon the whole, the growth of tumours is to be viewed as the result of an aberra- tion or anormal action of the usual nutritive pro- cess to which the capillary vessels are subservient.* The theory of tumours or morbid growths de- pending on inordinate local developement of the ca- pillary system was understood by Valsalva, Mor- gagni, Pohl, and others, but has recently been much illustrated by John Bell and Mr Abernethy. f • " As wounded parts ax'e healed by adhesion, so are di- lated or strained parts by increased nutrition."—" Tumour and various modifications of disease follow from the same law of vascular action and nutrition which maintained health. If each individual vessel, whether artery or vein, have its coats thickened by dilatation or partial laceration, the same must be presumed of each minuter vessel in the distended womb, of each lesser vein and petty artery in a piece of dis- tended skin, or in a diseased gland. The enlargement, then, of each blood-vessel by deposition of nutritious matter along its sides makes not a mere distension of vessels, but a solid and permanent bulk. The more vessels are enlarged con- sistently with their healthy action, the more particles ai'e they able to secrete ; whence the increment of tumours is perpetually accelerating, unless ■when opposed by peculiar causes."—The Principles of Surgery, by John Bell, sur- geon.

Each flock con- sists of six or seven plates {lamince) starting di- rectly, as it were, from the beginning of the pe- duncle, and with the concave margins directed to- wards the protuberance. Ruysch has represented in their site objects to which he applies the name of vermiform promi- nences ; a circvimstance which is in some measure to be ascribed to the vague manner in which this term has been used. The valley {vallecula, Valletta, das Thai) or hollow between the two hemispheres, is occupied by a numerous series of plates, which lie trans- versely, are parallel to each other, and which form a sort of uniting medium of the cerebeUic plates of each side. The appearance of this region in the brain of the dog and monkey, the animals which the ancient anatomists chiefly dissected, might furnish them with some reason for apply- ing to it the name of worm, or worm-shaped body; {sKuhJi^, ZTnpvffig azoSk'ifiMnl'/ig.)

With a view to obviate all misconception on this point, Malacarne has recourse to distinctions

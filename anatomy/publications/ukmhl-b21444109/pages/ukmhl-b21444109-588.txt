564 GENERAL ANATOMY. by Severinus, Meiy, and Mr John Bell, I am in- clined to refer to the head of exostosis depending on disease of the medullary membrane. b. The medullary filamentous web is perhaps still more important in its morbid influence on bone than the periosteum. It is, in the first place, liable to inflammation; and, according as this takes place in the medullary web of the cylindrical bones, or in that of their epiphyses, or of the short irregular bones, different effects result. a. Necrosis.â€”That the medullary web of the cy- lindrical bones is liable to inflammation is a well established point. The tendency of this is not so well understood. It may proceed either to sup- puration, forming a collection of matter within the cavity of the bone; or by producing effusion within the interstices of the medullary web it may, by causing induration and swelling, induce ex- pansion of the walls of the diaphysis; or by de- stroying the medullary membrane, it may kill the bone from within outwards. That inflammation of the medullary web causes swelling and effusion into its interstices may be regarded as established by the phenomena of frac- tures, simple and compound, and especially by those experiments in which this texture is ex- pressly injured. When it proceeds without being resolved, it may cause a uniform expansion of the bone, which very often precedes the extinction of its vitality. Thus in most of the instances of the incipient stage of necrosis a local enlargement, or

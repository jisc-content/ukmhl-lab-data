20 GENERAL ANATOMY VII. Muscular. 1. Animal or voluntary. 2. Organic or involuntary. VIII. Nervous. This arrangement, which is undoubtedly very elaborate, and perhaps more comprehensive than either that of Bichat or any other author, is not, however, quite faultless. It may be doubted whe- ther the lens is an organic body at all, and it is certainly much less an organic substance than the cornea, with which it is arranged. Cellular and cutaneous tissue are certainly not so similar as to admit of being referred to the same rank ; and the organs destined to contain secreted fluids are so opposite and different in structure, that it appears rather violent to connect them in one group. The proper membrane of the intestinal tube, is, according to the result of my observations, nothing but the corion of the villous membrane ; at least I cannot conceive any other part to which the de- scription will apply; and surely the soft cerebral membrane (pia mater) cannot justly be associated with such substances as ligaments, tendons, or aponeurotic sheaths. The system termed glandularby Professor Mayer is still more awkwardly situate. For not only is it doubtful with what justice the lymphatic glands are associated with the proper secreting glands, but the latter are themselves much varied in struc- ture and anatomical characters ; and as to the old notion of glandular^ structure being merely an ex- pansion of vessels arranged in a peculiar manner, I fear that is not only too general to be true.

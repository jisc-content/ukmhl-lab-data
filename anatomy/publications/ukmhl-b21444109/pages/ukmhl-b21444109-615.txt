Cartilage is also liable to ossification, as is seen in those of the larynx, of the ribs, &c. In these the osseous matter is disseminated in irregular points and patches. In diseases of the hip-joint, the cartilages of the thigh-bone and acetabulum become not only bony, but may be converted into a substance similar to ivory. (Bichat.) A new formation of cartilage is frequently found in various tissues, but especially in the se- rous and synovial membranes, to which it is not uncommon to find cartilaginous bodies attached. Cartilaginous texture is also found in those sar- comatous tumours which eventually pass into in- sanable ulceration. CHAPTER XX.

Intermediate between the cartilaginous and the fibrovis tissues, Bichat ranks that of the [ibro-cartilages, which comprehends three subdi- nsions. The membranous fibro-cartilages, is those of the ears, nose, windpipe, eyelids, &c.; The inter-articular fibro-cartilages, as those bund in the temporo-maxillary and femoro-tibial

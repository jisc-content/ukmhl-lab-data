On each side of this other lines are remarked following the same direction. In gene- ral, they are situate about three or four lines from the median plane; but are in a few instances ob- served to be very regular in their disposition at the anterior end of the middle band. About its middle, however, a very distinct appearance of lines collected into a considerable bundle, may be observed proceeding backwards to its posterior end. As they advance they become more distinct, are about 1^ line broad, and of a grayish colour ; at the posterior end of the middle band, they di- verge somewhat, and, passing over this, proceed in a lateral direction downwards, till they are lost about the spot where the limbs of the brain {crura cerebri. Die Hirnschenkel) issue from the optic eminences. This forms the inner, central, or gray portion of the cylindroid eminence. The posterior extremity of this body is round- ed ; and when the membranes have been remov- ed, the surface which forms this rounded end is found to communicate directly with the chamber named third or middle ventricle. This surface is in truth continued forward, and forms the vault or ceiling, (fornix. Die Zwillingsbinde, the twain band, Reil,) a point which, though suffi- ciently obvious, is never noticed in description, or perspicuously demonstrated. The names of cal- X

528 GENERAL ANATOMY. ticular or cellular arrangement which Scarpa de- scribes as demonstrable in bone. It must, I con- ceive, be the result of the mode of preparation. Recently bone has been submitted to microscopic examination by Mr Howship, who has been led to revive the opinion of the existence of minute lon- gitudinal canals, as maintained by Lewenhoeck, Havers, and Reichel, but with Scarpa maintains the ultimate texture not to be laminated but reti- culated. * Lastly, the existence of fibres and plates, which is admitted by Blumenbach, Bichat, and Meckel, apparently on insufficient grounds, is to be viewed as an appearance produced by the physical, and perhaps the chemical qualities of the proper animal-organic matter of which bone consists. Though it does not demonstrate, it depends on, the intimate structure of this body. The minute structure or atomic constitution of bone is probably the same in all the pieces of the skeleton, and is varied only in mechanical arrange- ment. Wlien a cylindrical bone is broken, and its surfaces are examined with a good magnifying glass; or when minute splint^s are inspected in a powerful microscope, it appears to be a uniform substance without fibres, plates, or cells, penetrated everywhere by minute blood-vessels. Its fracture is uneven, passing to splintery. In the recent state its colour is bluish-white ; but in advanced age the blue tinge disappears. Delicate injection, * Experiments and Observations, &c.

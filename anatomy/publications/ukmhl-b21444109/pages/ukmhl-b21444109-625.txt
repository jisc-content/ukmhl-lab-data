SKIN. 601 secretion or deposition. This semifluid viscid matter, which, in point of fact, is found between the outer surface of the corion and the .firm cu- ticle, appears to be the substance mentioned by Malpighi, and so often spoken of as the mucous body or net (corpus mucosum.) It is certainly quite inorganic ; and it is impossible to explain its production otherwise than by ascribing it to the outer or vascular sui'face of the corion. Cuticle is rendered yellow, and finally dissolved by immersion in nitric acid. It is also dissolved by sulphuric acid, in the form of a deep brown pulp. These, and some other experiments per- foi'med by Hatchett, appear to show that it consists chiefly of albuminous matter somehow modified. This description shows, that, if strict observa- tion be trusted, the mucous net has no existence, at least in the European. In the Negro, Caffre, and Malay, however, a black membrane is said to be interposed between the corion and cuticle, and to be the cause of the dark complexion of these races. On this subject I refer to the description given by Cruickshank,* which is the best, the Essay of M. Gaultier already quoted, and the ob- servations of Beclard. What is found in the skin of the mixed or half cast races, i. e. the offspring of an African and an European, or of a mulatto and European ? and how is the transition be- tween this colouring layer and its insensible dimi- nution effected ? Nail is a substance very familiarly known. On * Experiments, &c. p. 31.

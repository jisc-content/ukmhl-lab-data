BRAIN. 469 Ibid A man of 66. Right hemiplegy twice, followed by raving, unintelligible speech, insensibility, coma, and death. In the central and posterior part of the left hemisphere a hard irregular mass, internally of a saffron-yellow colour in some parts, of a rust-yellow in others, jaspered, mai-ked by numerous small white bodies varying from the size of a len- tile and a pea to that of a filbert, furrowed in various direc- tions by minute filaments. The hardest of these bodies M. Bouillaud regards as scirrhous matter in the crude stage. Others resembling a white concentrated glue, he thinks might be the colloid or glue-like cancer of M. Laennec. While the greater part of this body was hard, its centre was reduced to a yellow diffluent pulp. Mr R. Wade, Medical and Physical Journal.—In the up- per part of the left lobe (hemisphere) of the brain, a hard body of the size of a small hen's egg, like medullary sarco- ma, but as firm as scirrhus of the female breast. The great- est part consisted of yellow-white striae, as hard as cartilage, the remainder dark gray and less firm, not very distinguish- able after maceration. Pulpy destruction around. Under his fifth head, Dr Monro has shortly no- ticed seven specimens of this change of structure preserved in the University Museum. Its hard- ness, irregular surface, and cartilaginous struc- ture, with a resemblance to a section of the kid- ney, are the circumstances principally remarked. From the above accounts, which I consider to be the most authentic on record, a general idea of the anatomical characters of what is meant by scirrhus of the brain (chondroma) may be obtain- ed. A mass generally of irregular shape, dis- other circumstances. A case of tumour called cancerous is also given in the " Observations" of M. Lerminier.— Annuaire Medico-Chirurg. p. 225.

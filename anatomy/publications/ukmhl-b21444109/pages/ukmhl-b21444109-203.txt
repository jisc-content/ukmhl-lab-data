SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 181 or cartilage; or of a nature entirely dissimilar, and never seen unless in the morbid state ; for instance, the several varieties of tubercular deposition, of scirrhous deposition, of fungoid deposition, and se- veral of the forms of sarcoma enumerated by Mr Abernethy. In whatever mode these new productions vary in intimate structure, all agree in being connected with more or less augmented developement of the capillary system. In many the growth, if not the origin, can be traced to the increased number, or at least enlarged size, of the capillary arteries. In most of these tumours the vessels are large, nu- merous, and well fiUed with blood ; and if divided in the living body they are the source of abun- dant hemorrhage. In some instances these ves- sels penetrate from the adjoining tissue all round the tumour in the form of numerous minute ar- teries, which afterwards are ramified in the tu- mour. In others, which are perhaps more nume- rous, they enter at one point in the shape of three or four large trunks, which are afterwards divid- ed in the substance of the growth. As these new or foreign growths, therefore, are known to abound in capillaries, it is inferred, that, if this abundance of vessels be not the direct cause, they furnish the materials of growth. The difficulty in the theory of their formation is to as- certain the circumstances which first determine this local developement of the capillary system. In some instances it can be distinctly traced to me- chanical injury, (John Bell and Abernethy.) After

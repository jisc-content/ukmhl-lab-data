NERVOUS TISSUE. 281 The nerves of the involuntary muscles are equally distinct in proportion. Those of the lung, heart, and splanchnic system are distinct and manifest at the eighth month. The neurilem is much more vascular in the foe- tus than in the adult. In the same foetus of about eight months I found the neurilem of the sciatic nerve, from the ischiatic notch to its divarication in the ham, covered with a thick net-work of mi- nute vessels, all injected with dark blood. Section II 1. Inflammation, spontaneous and from injury^ â€”Nerve-ach, Neuralgia (Neurilemmia). Ner- vous tissue is liable to inflammation. This may arise spontaneously, or in consequence of injury, as contusion, wound, laceration, ligature, &c. It is accompanied first with gnawing pain, which is of- tener periodical than constant, spreading along the course of the nerve, sometimes its branches, with a sense of heat often very disagreeable, and a pe- culiar tenderness of the surface. After some time the pain is less violent, but more constant; and more or less derangement in the functions of the parts to which the nerve goes takes place. The skin becomes numb, cold, and insensible. Of muscular parts the motions are variously disordered, be- coming irregular, spasmodic, and little under the influence of the will, so as to constitute convul-

GENERAL ANATOMY. 66 a degree, that we find the heart or mesentery of such subjects as free from fat as in the youngest children." This, however, is in some degree de- nied by Bichat, who contends that it is not un- common to find much subcutaneous fat in subjects greatly infiltrated, (Vol. I. p. 57.) It is obvious that much will depend on the stage of the disease. It cannot be expected, that the moment serous in- filtration appears in the filamentous tissue, all the fat should be at once removed from the adipose. The process of absorption is gradual as that of de- position ; and the inference of Hunter may be re- garded as nearly exact in reference to long-con- tinued, or what he terms inveterate dropsy. It is certain, that, while it is very difficult to deprive the bones of ordinary subjects of oil, those of drop- sical subjects are the only ones which it is possi- ble to obtain free from this substance. The removal of the fat from its containing membrane is effected by the process of absorption, the agents of which are supposed by William Hunter, Portal, Bichat, and Mascagni, to be the lymphatics. According to the results of the ex- periments of Magendie, Mayer, Tiedemann and Gmelin, Segalas, &c. it must, in some measure at least, be ascribed to the influence of minute veins. It is a point of some interest to know in what form it is absorbed, whether as oily matter, or after undergoing a process of decomposition. The ob- servation of Dr Traill, above quoted, would lead to the former view ; but it is not easy to conceive

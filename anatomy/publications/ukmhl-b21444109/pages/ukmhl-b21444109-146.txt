124 GENERAL ANATOMY. and area of the venous tubes are much larger than those of the corresponding arteries, and conse- quently that the capacity of the venous system is much greater than that of the arterial. I acknow- ledge that I know not on what exact evidence the former of these propositions, the only one with which the anatomist is concerned, is made to rest. If it be mere inspection in the dead subject, or the effects of injection, little doubt can be entertained that the alleged greater calibre depends chiefly on the laxity and distensible nature of the venous fibre. The arterial tubes appear small in conse- quence of the tendency which they have to col- lapse, or annular contraction, when the distending force has ceased to operate. The venous canals appear large by reason of their distension and dis- tensibility during life, from the tendency to ac- cumulation in their branches in most kinds of death, except that by hemorrhage, and from a smaller degree of the physical property of shrink- ing and annular contraction when empty. When a vascular sheath is exposed in the hu- man subject, as in the operation for aneurism, or in the lower animals in the way of experiment, the vein, it must be admitted, generally appears larger than the corresponding artery. This, how- ever, is never so considerable as it is represented by most authors, and certainly could by no means afford grounds for the high estimates which Keill, Jurin, and other mathematical physiologists have assigned to the relative capacity of the arteries and veins. It is also to be observed that something of

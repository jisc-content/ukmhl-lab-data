43d BRAIN. Notwithstanding the authority of these obser- vers, I think it doubtful whether this change can be supposed to take place in the short period as- signed for it. Is it not more reasonable to think that this change had pre-existed for some time, and that it terminated in a more acute disorder of the organ or its membranes, which proved fatal ? |3. The chronic induration of the brain has been long known. Originally observed by Littre, Geof- froy, Boerhaave, Lancisi, and Santorini, it was recognized by Morgagni as a morbid change which occasionally caused more or less mental derange- ment.* J. F. Meckel afterwards undertook to es- tablish this doctrine more fully, and to show that the organ is harder and more elastic than natural. With this change, however, he rather paradoxi- cally connects another, diminution of specific gra- vity, and finds that a cube of six lines of indurated brain is from 1^ to 2 grains lighter than a cube of the same size of sound brain. In six among fifteen cases given by this author, the brain was much firmer than natural; in some as hard as in- durated white of egg, and always elastic.j This result, though not entirely, is partly veri- la substance du Cerveau, consideree comme un efFet de I'en- cephalite generale aigue, par M.

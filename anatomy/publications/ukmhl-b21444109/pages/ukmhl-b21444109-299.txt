NERVOUS TISSUE. 277 and a plexus is an expanded or unfolded ganglion. The great anatomical purpose of both appears to be simply a new arrangement or disposition of nervous branches, previous to their ultimate dis- tribution in the tissues or organs to which they are destined. This is nothing but the expression of a fact,—the interpretation in intelligible terms of an arrangement of organized parts without re- ference to any supposed uses. I have already shown what is meant by the organic end or termination of a nerve. Although the nervous trunks are distributed in every direc- tion through the animal body, they do not ter- minate in all the tissues or organs indiscriminate- ly ; and have been observed to be lost in the fol- lowing only. 1st, the proper organs of sensation, the eye, ear, nose, palate, and tongue; 2d, the muscles, whether subservient to voluntary or to involuntary motion, as the heart, stomach, intes- tines, &c.; Sd, the mucous surfaces; 4^^, the skin ; 5th, glands, salivary, liver, kidneys, &c.; 6th, bones. Nerves, therefore, are not organs of general dis- tribution. According to Bichat, they have never been traced to the following tissues :—the carti- lages, both articular and of the cavities ; fibrous textures, viz. periosteum, dura meninx, capsular ligaments, aponeurotic sheaths, aponeurosis in ge- neral, tendon and ligament; fibro-cartilaginous textures; those of the external ear, nose, trachea, and eyelids, (cartilages of other authors); the se-

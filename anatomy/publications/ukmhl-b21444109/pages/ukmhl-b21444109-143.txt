VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 121 Baker, * Haller and Spallanzaiii, f did in their ob- servations on the transparent parts of animals in general cold-blooded. From the experiments of these observers, we know that a very small vessel, evidently tending and conveying blood towards a larger, connected with a venous branch, may be seen passing directly from a similar small vessel, as evidently conveying blood from a larger, Avhich is connected with the arterial system. All that we know from this, however, is, that a vein containing red blood may rise from an artery conveying red blood. This is matter of pure observation, and all beyond is little more than conjectural. Haller indeed admits origins of veins as mani- fold as the terminations of the arterial system, a view in which he has been followed by almost all subsequent authors ; and Bichat states it as a leading proposition, that the veins arise from the general capillary system. Neither conclusion is founded on strict observation ; and while that of the former physiologist is derived chiefly from un- certain facts and loose analogies, the statement of the latter is too hypothetical and general to be either entirely true or wholly false. Of one fact only are we certain. The blood which is conveyed into the small vessels and the substance of the tissues and organs is brought back by the veins. We have seen that the only * On Microscopes, and the discoveries made thereby. Two vols. 8vo. London, 1785. t Experiments on the Circulation of the Blood. By La- zaro Spallanzani. Translated by W.

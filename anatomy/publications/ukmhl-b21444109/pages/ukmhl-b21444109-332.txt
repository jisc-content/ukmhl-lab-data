310 GENERAL ANATOMY. cing nearer to the mesial plane, they proceed, by an acute circular turn, almost straight back- wards, so as to form, at the posterior edge of the organ, a deep rectangular notch, )_( not un- like the figure of the ancient lyre. This posterior hollow, in which is lodged the cerebellic vertical portion of the hard membrane (falx cerehelli,) is named by Malacarne the common perpendi- cular fissure (incavatura,) and by Reil, to whose fancy this epithet seems to have been deficient in expression, the purse-like fissure (Der beutelfor- mige Ausschnitt.) Between these two well-mark- ed boundaries the cerebellic plates, of which the hemispheres consist, are united in the middle by a confused interlacing junction {u7i intreccio confiuso ed irregolare di sostanza,) to which the Italian anatomist gives the name of suture {raffe, raphe) of the cerebellum. I find that the careful remo- val of the soft membrane {pia mater) renders this more distinct, and shows the mesial termination of the hemispherical plates. On the surface, a large hollow between the hemispheres, and ex- tending backwards from the semilunar to the purse-like fissure, previously called by HaUer {vallecula,) the little valley, received from Mala- carne the corresponding term (Valletta,) in his own language. The divisions of the cerebellic surface made by Malacarne, and adopted by Reil, are found- ed entirely on the groups of plates, and the com- parative depth of the furrows by which these

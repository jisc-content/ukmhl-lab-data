GENERAL ANATOMY. 464 structure. Though fovmd near the exterior or convoluted surface, they penetrated pretty deep in- to the substance of the organ. According to the cases given by M. Hebreart this change may occur either under the shape of a conversion or degeneration of the cerebral sub- stance into matter of a yellowish colour and lar- daceous consistence, or in the formation of a dis- tinct tumour in the substance of the organ. Though from his account it appears to be by no means so rare as might be expected from the observa- tions of the Austrian anatomists, he gives only two cases of its occurrence in the brain, and two in the cerebellum. In the first of the former, a distinct tumour, consisting of matter of a yellow- colour and lard-like consistence, the size of a nut, in the anterior part of the anterior lobe of the right hemisphere, gave rise to idiocy. In the se- cond, a square inch of the posterior lobe of the left hemisphere was converted into a yellowish pulpy substance, which was separated from the contiguous sound brain by hardened cerebral mat- ter. This in a man of 40 caused epileptic pa- roxysms once or twice a month, terminating in as- phyxia, which at length proved fatal. In the first of the cerebellic cases, in a young man, who had been idiotic for six years, the cerebral sub- stance forming the walls of the fourth ventricle had for the depth of more than a line, been converted into yellowish lardaceous matter. In the second, that of an incurable maniac, a space six lines in diameter of the lower part of the right hemi-

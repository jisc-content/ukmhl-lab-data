353 BRAIN. Stretching in the form of thick strong bands between the peduncles of the cerebellum above, and the spinal chord below, the restiform pro- cesses are mutually parted by a deep furrow, {ca- lamus scriptorius,) in the bottom of which, when slightly separated, white chords proceeding from the process of one side are observed to be plaited or crossed with those of the other. This arrange- ment was first observed by Dominico Mistichelli,* a ph3^sician at Rome, in 1709, and shortly after by Pourfour de Petit f at Namur. Though subse- quently verified by the observation of Santorini, X cesses have been completely neglected, and are scarcely known even by name. It is not uncommon both in books and in demonstration^ to see them pointed out as the corpora pyramidalia. By those who wish to avoid the confusion re- sulting from this oversight, they are termed posterior pyra- midal bodies ; and in support of this, the authority of Ruysch, Prochaska, and Soemmering * may be adduced. * Trattato dell' Apoplessia.

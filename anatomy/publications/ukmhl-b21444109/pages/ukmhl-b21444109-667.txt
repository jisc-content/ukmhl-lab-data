64S SKIN. When this was exposed to the temperature of the spirit-lamp, the greatest part of the volatile oil was evaporated, leaving a transparent, colourless, but viscid and semifluid substance, com- municating to paper a stain becoming less deep, but not wholly removable by exposure to a liigh temperature. These results favour the idea that the matter of these bodies is oleaginous ; but I was unable to observe any action of aqua potasses or aqua ammon'ue, after repeated trials, both at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere and when liquefied by a gentle heat. By the sulphuric acid it is hardened and blackened ; by the nitric acid its yellow colour is rendered more in- tense. * Whether the presence of these yellow adipocirous bodies is uniform in the molluscum I have had no subsequent means of ascertaining. If they are, it may be reasonably conjec- tured that their formation depends on some morbid or vitia- ted state of the sebaceous follicles. Wart and corn are believed to depend on morbid accumu- lation of cuticle. The former, however, is vascular at its basis; and it may therefore be inferred that its production depends on morbid action of the surface of the corion at the particular point at which it appears. 2. Dermalcemia. Dermatorrhagia.â€”Hemorrhage of the skin appears under two forms; either that of a bloody or blood- coloured fluid oozing from certain regions, or of blood ef- fused in the form of purple specks, spots, patches, or livid stripes on the surface of the corion below the scarf-skin. The former discharge is rare, and takes place chiefly as a supple- mentary evacuation to some natural one accidentally sup- pressed, as the menstrual discharge in females. The latter is of a different nature, and is both the effect and proof of a morbid state of the system. Restricted in this manner, hemorrhage from the corion * A good painting of the subject of this case was made by my late friend StafT-Surgeon Schetky, and by him deposited in the pathological collection of Chatham Hospital.

189 ERECTILE TISSUE. form very numerous inosculations or anastomoses, precisely as the capillary system of which they constitute a part. The effect of this arrangement is to give these vessels the appearance of being penetrated with sieve-like openings, which makes them resemble areolcB, or interlaminar spaces mu- tually communicating. As the whole difference, therefore, between the capillary vessels of this and other parts of the human frame consists in the minute veins {I'adiculcB venosat) being dilated or distended in a peculiar manner, M. Beclard con- cludes, that the erectile tissue of the cavernous body consists simply of minute arteries and dila- table veins interwoven in the manner of cajiiUary nets. These distended venous cavities are indeed so remote from being cells, that they are truly continuous with veins, the inner membrane of which may be easily recognized among them. * During erection the blood accumulates in this tissue ; but the cause and mechanism of this accu- mulation are completely unknown. The spleen, M. Beclard thinks, may be said to resemble the cavernous body both in structure and phenomena; and he considers it as at once consisting of erectile tissue, and to be the seat of a species of erection more or less similar to that of the cavernous body. This organ, he argues, be- comes the occasional seat of a motion of expansion and contraction ; and he adduces the three follow- ing conditions in which it takes place. 1*^, In ex- * Additions, p. 119.

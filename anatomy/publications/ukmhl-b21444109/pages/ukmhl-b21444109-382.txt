GENERAI, ANATOMY. 360 at once, and to have a correct conception of their assembled disposition, it is requisite to pare off from its outer surface the exterior white matter, or to excavate externally, so as to form a spheri- cal segment. The outer wall of the capsule is in short a spherical shell, consisting of fibres radiating from a point above the Jbssa Sylvii. So far as I have been able to observe, it has no connection with the limbs of the brain. The inner wall of the capsule is composed, on the contrary, of the stem of the limb, and the fore-part of the stafFwreath, which sends fibres under the round part of the inner portion of the nucleus. Joining the outer wall above by means of an arched margin, and at acute angles, it gives the capsule the shape of an inverted boat. In this capsule is lodged the outer part of the large striated nucleus of the brain ; the inner, usually named corpus striatum, being covered only by epithelion within the ventricle. Both are parts of one organ which should not be separated. Of the cerebellum, the internal arrangement is nearly the following. The restiform processes I have already men- tioned as connected partly with the protuberance, partly with the four eminences (corpora quadri- gemina) situate on its upper surface. The circu- lar transverse fibres of the protuberance, which enclose the longitudinal ones produced in a lateral- posterior direction, plunge into the cerebellic he-

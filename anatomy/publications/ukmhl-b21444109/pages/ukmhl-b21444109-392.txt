370 GENERAL ANATOMY. the small globules (s^oo of an inch ;) and the vis- cid jelly is said to be at least equal to the glo- bules in quantity. In the limbs of the brain and peduncles of the cerebellum, the jelly is said to be in greater proportion than the globules. The an- nular protuberance is chiefly composed of globules of the average size Uioot) with abundant viscid matter. In the restiform processes, the pyramidal bodies, and the olivary eminences, the fibrous structure consists chiefly of the large globules, with abundant viscid jelly, which is rapidly so- luble in water.* When the brain by immersion in alcohol is hardened, the elastic jelly is coagvilated and ren- dered opaque, and the appearance of globules is lost, t These observations partly verify those of Delia Torre, partly explain those of Prochaska. They show, that, so far as the microscope can be trust- ed, the globules of which cerebral matter consists vary in size and proportion in different parts ; and that the white cerebral matter generally con- sists of larger globules, or at least contains a larger proportion of these globules than the gray.

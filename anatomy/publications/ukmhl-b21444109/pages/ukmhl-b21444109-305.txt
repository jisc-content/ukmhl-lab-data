283 NERVOUS TISSUE. feet save that of thickening and stiffness by effu- sion of lymph. An idea has been advanced by Reil, that gene- ral inflammation of the neurilema takes place in typhus fever, and is the pathological cause of that disease. * That the vessels of this tissue may be gorged in common with those of every other is exceedingly probable, and may be often the case. But it is manifest that this is one only of many simultaneous effects ; and it is further evident, that neither observation nor anatomical inspec- tion can justify the conclusion, that inflammation of the neurilema is the pathological cause of fever. 2. Neurilemmia Chronica. Inflammation of nervous tissue may terminate, 1*^, in resolution ; 2d, in effusion of lymph ; Sd, in ulceration ; or, Mh, it may induce a low chronic action, accom- panied with enlargement of the nerve, or morbid growth by deposition of new matter. These phe- nomena are most distinctly seen in the changes which follow wounds of nerves. In this case effusion of lymph is common, and is not unfre- quently succeeded either by local palsy, or by a train of symptoms similar to nerve-ache. (Neural- gia.) Dr Denmark saw a contused wound of the ra- dial nerve produce neuralgic symptoms requiring amputation, f Charles Bell saw the same result succeed contusion without wound in the popliteal * Fieberlehre, Band, iv, p. 56. t Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. IV. p. 18.

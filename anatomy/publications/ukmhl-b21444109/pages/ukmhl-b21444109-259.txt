LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 237 In truth, scarcely an incision dividing the skin and ceUular membrane can fail to involve several lymphatics, and every deep incision divides many of them.* They appear to unite easily. Is the cavity obliterated ? The frequent anastomoses render this event of no consequence. Hewson observed, that in several instances lymphy coagu- lable fluid continued to ooze from the wounded vessel for days. 3. Cirsus (Ki^ffo?) or Varicose Dilatation. This name is applied by Meckel to denote a dilated state of lymphatics similar to varix in veins. Sclireger and Tilesius delineate what they conceive to be va- rix in the lymphatics of the conjunctiva; Mascag- ni represents the same condition in those of the lungs ; and Soemmering describes those of the in- testines as varicose in hernia. The same condi- tion was observed by Bichat in the lymphatics of serous membranes. In dropsical subjects they are always much distended with fluid; and hence the anatomist finds their demonstration much more easy in such circumstances. 4. Rupture of the lymphatics has been assumed as a probable cause of consumption by Morton, of scrofula in general by Ackerman, of Barbadoes leg by Hendy, of puerperal swelled leg by White, of dropsy by Van Swieten, Haase, f Assalini, X Â» Monro in Edin.

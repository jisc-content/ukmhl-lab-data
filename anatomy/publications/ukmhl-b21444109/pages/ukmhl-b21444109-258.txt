236 GENERAL ANATOM\^ Not less objectionable is the notion advanced by Charles White,*' that inflammation or obstruction of the lymphatics is the cause of the swelled leg, (pJdegmasia dolens,) of puerperal women. Obser- vation and dissection concur in showing that this malady also arises from inflammation terminating in albuminous or sero-albuminous exudation. Inflammation of lymphatic vessels may almost invariably be traced to irritation, or an irritating cause at their organic extremities. Thus a sore in the finger or hand, whitloe, or other inflamed states of the fingers, are often attended with pain- ful red streaks or lines, extending up the arm to the arm-pit. These red streaks indicate inflam- mation of the subcutaneous lymphatics. In like manner I have seen a blister applied to the sur- face of the belly cause inflammation of the lym- phatics leading to the inguinal glands. The inflammation when not violent terminates in resolution. In more severe cases it may cause effusion of lymph into the cavity of the vessel, so as to effect adhesion, and obliterate its canal. This was probably the cause of the obstruction which Mascagni states he found in the lymphatics of several subjects after the use of blisters. Sup- puration, as a consequence of inflammation of lym- phatics, is little known. 2.

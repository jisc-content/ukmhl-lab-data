485 BRAIN. 10. AnencepJialous monstrosity.—This should be noticed elsewhere. But it may perhaps render the history of the anormal states of the brain more complete, to introduce here a species of malforma- tion arising from interruption of the process of de- velopement. Instances of acephalous foetuses, as they have been named, are numerous from the first records of anatomy to the present time. They vary in degree from deficiency of the whole brain to that of more or fewer of its parts. All of them depend, so far as is hitherto ascertained, on the same general cause, a sudden check given to the process of growth in this organ, while the others continue to increase. The general accuracy of this conclusion is established by the researches of Meckel,* of Dun- can Junior,f of Breschet,! andof Serres.^ The mode in which this is effected may be understood from the history of the progressive developement of the organ, which I have stated above is formed by de- position from the vascular membrane, commencing near the centre of the hemispheres, and proceeding in both directions towards the convoluted and the * Handbuch der Pathologischen anatomic, von J.

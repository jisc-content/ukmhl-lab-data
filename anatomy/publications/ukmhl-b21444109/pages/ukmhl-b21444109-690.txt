GENERAL ANATOMY. 666 ternal as the skin incloses the external organs. * This view has been adopted by Meckel and Be- clard, to whom I refer for the proofs of its accu- racy. I cannot conclude the subject, however, without observing that one of the most conclusive arguments in its favour is derived from the cir- cumstances of the developement of the intestinal canal during the first months of uterine life. The history of this curious process, which has been so happily investigated by Wolff and Oken, f and so well traced by Meckel, shows that at this period the gastro-enteric mucous membrane, which is previ- ously formed by the vitellar membrane of the ovum, and the allantois or vesical membrane, which afterwards forms the genito-urinary mucous sur- face, are in direct communication on the median line, and afterwards at the navel with the skin or exterior integument. :j: The detailed history of this process belongs, however, rather to special than to general anatomy ; and I notice it here as the strongest proof which occurs to me of the connection between the skin and the mucous membranes, and as an anatomical fact which fur- nishes the solution of some curious congenital malformations, and of various morbid processes, which affect simultaneously, successively, or oc- casionally, both orders of membranes. * Specimen Anatomico-Medicum Inaug. &c.

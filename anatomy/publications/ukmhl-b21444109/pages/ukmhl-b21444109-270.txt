GENERAL ANATOMY. 248 more uneasiness than an ordinary abscess. Its duration varies according to the size and num- ber of the glands to be ejected. In the most dis- tinct cases which I have seen it occupied between three and four months. This disorder I regard as arising from a gland being suddenly smitten, as it were, with death in its intimate structure, from previous disease of its membranous capsule and proper vessels. I have seen it only in those at the bend of the arm ; and to Cruickshank it appears to have occurred in the same situation.* It may occur, however, and probably has been seen by others elsewhere. /3.

188 GENERAL ANATOMY. a very great number of minute veins, which pour their blood into the cutaneous dorsal vein ; Q.d, That the urethra, and especially its posterior part, may in like manner be shoAvn to consist of nume- rous minute veins, which terminate in a posterior branch of the dorsal vein, and communicate with the veins of the bulbous portion of the urethra ; and, Sd, That in the cavernous bodies, though al- so receiving blood-vessels, these are much less numerous, and are chiefly derived from the ure- thral vessels. * The same arrangement was recognized by Cu- vier in the penis of the elephant, and by Tiede- mann in that of the horse. Upon the whole, the facts collected by different anatomists on this subject furnish the following results. If the arteries, on the one hand, be injected, they are found to terminate in very fine ramifications, the disposition of which is exactly the same as in other parts. If, on the other, the veins be injected, it is easy to perceive the two following circum- stances. 1*^, That they are much dilated at their origin, that is, that the venous radicul<B are really more dilated than might be anticipated from the other characters of these vessels. 2^/, That the tubular dilatations to which they are accessory, * Commentarium de Urethras Corporis Glandisque Struc- tura Cto Idus Decembris 1810 detecta Alexandri Bloreschi, Eq.

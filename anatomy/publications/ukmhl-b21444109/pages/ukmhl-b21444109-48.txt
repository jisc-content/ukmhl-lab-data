GENERAL ANATOMY. 28 cohol into the filamentous tissue of an animal pre- viously rendered emphysematous, and found in various parts ivJdtishflocculi, which he regarded as coagulated albumen. He also obtained the same result by immersing a portion of the scrotum in weak nitric acid ; and when a considerable quan- tity of this tissue was boiled, it furnished much whitish foam, which Bichat regarded as albumi- nous. * These experiments, however, are liable to this objection, that the effects in question may have arisen from coagulation of part of the filamentous tissue itself, which contains a considerable propor- tion of albuminous matter. The best mode of de- termining the point is to obtain the fluid apart, and to try the effects of the usual tests on it when isolated from the tissue in which it is lodged. The description here given applies to the pro- per filamentous tissue. This substance was shown by Ruysch, and afterwards by William Hunter and Mascagni, to be penetrated by arteries and veins. Exhalants, absorbents, and nerves, it is also said to receive. The arteries certainly be- long in the healthy state to the order of colourless capillaries, which is nearly the same with exha- lants. It does not appear that the nervous twigs observed to pass through this tissue are lost in it, for in general they have been traced to some con- tiguous part. Such are the general properties of this tissue considered as an elementary organic substance Â» Anatomie General, Tome I. p. 50.

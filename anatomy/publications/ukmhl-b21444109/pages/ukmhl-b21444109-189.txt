SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 16? of action takes place. The vessels begin to de- posit lymph in rounded masses, which become vas- cular ; and all the phenomena of granulation suc- ceed. In svich circumstances, are we to suppose that the absorbing process has given way to that of deposition,â€”the action of veins and lymphatics to that of minute arteries ? In certain situations this process of deposition may be observed going on in one part of a sore, while that of removal, destruction, or absorption is proceeding in another. Thus in an eschar oc- casioned by a burn, or by cautery, actual or poten- tial, while the process of ulceration is detaching the margin of the slough, a crop of granulations may be observed rising with equal rapidity and steadiness, and pushing off, as it were, the dead substance. The phenomena of these and similar processes present objections to the theory of Hun- ter. e. Induration. This, which by the older patho- logists was thought to be scirrhus, {cKippog, in- duratio,) is occasioned by the effusion of lymph, which, as it coagulates, causes adhesion of the fila- mentous tissue either subcutaneous, or of any or- gan, e. g. a gland, the lungs, &c. It is not a ter- mination so much as an effect of inflammation. ^. Gangrene or Mortification. This is much less frequent than has been supposed. It may occur in the skin, in mucous membranes, in fibrous structures, especially tendons, in bone, in cartilage, and in the substance of the lungs. In dry gan-

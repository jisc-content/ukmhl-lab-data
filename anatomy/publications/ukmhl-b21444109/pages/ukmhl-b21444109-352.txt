330 GENERAL ANATOMY. matter, enveloped in a thin curled plate of white matter, which is free at one edge,—the concave one,—and hangs over the gray band like a veil, but adheres, by its opposite, to the cerebral substance. It will be perceived, also, that the white plate does not adhere to the gray band, unless at its fixed margin, and that a probe or scalpel handle may be introduced into the angular furrow between them. * As the sections approach the upper end of the cylindroid process a new arrangement is observed. The white plate becomes unusually broad, and is less bent or rolled over the gray band ; while the latter, thus less completely cover- ed, instead of following the same direction with the white plate which it does below, is much se- parated from it, and leaves a considerable angle between the plate and itself. This arrangement is most conspicuous where the process corresponds to the upper part of the optic chamber and the cerebral limb. The white plate of the hijipocam- pus traced further is found to coalesce with the margins of the vault, and tapering as it approaches the anterior end of that body, is finally identified with its substance. The upper termination or connection of the gray band is different. When it begins to recede from the white plate, which it does nearly opposite to the optic eminence, it proceeds directly to the rounded posterior end of the central * This last fact may also be demonstrated without trans- verse sections, by simple elevation of the white plate by the handle of the instrument.

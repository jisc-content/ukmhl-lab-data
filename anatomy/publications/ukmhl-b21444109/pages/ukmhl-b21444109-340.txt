GENERAL ANATOMY. 318 completely new. Beginning with the back end of the valley at the purse-shaped notch, where are seen the plates afterwards named by Reil the short exposed cross-hands, (Die kurzen und sichtbaren- Querbander;) and the long covered cross-hands, (Die langen verdeckten Querbander ;) and pro- ceeding forward, he distinguishes a group of pa- rallel plates, or laminated leaves, to which he ap- plies the name of 'pyramid. This body, which is bounded behind by the purse-shaped notch, and before by another cluster of plates called by Mala- carne the umda, consists of twenty parallel plates, of which six, he observes, are very short; and a triangular termination in the longer, forms the summit of the body. The uvula {ugola) (Der Zapfen,* Reil,) which is anterior, he found to con- sist of twelve laminated leaves, to have six lines of longitudinal extent, and four of breadth. It is smaller than the pyramid, and conical, with its base turned to that body, (Reil.) Lastly, ante- rior to the uvula, and separated from it by a fur- row, is the laminar tubercle, f {tuherculo laminoso,) consisting of about ten thin leaves or transverse plates. This body, which is the smallest in the * Mr Mayo, by translating this term spigot, makes it appear to be a different part from that meant by Malacarne, and understood by Reil. Though the word der Zapfen sig- nifies spigot, it is also used to denote the uvula, and in this sense it is employed by Reil. t Encefalotomia Nuova, &c. Parte iii. Articolo x. p. 6l.

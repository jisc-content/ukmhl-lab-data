GENERAL ANATOMY. 244 phatic vessels which constitute the intimate struc- ture of the gland. These minute tubes are connected by delicate filamentous tissue, which is more abundant in ear- ly life than afterwai'ds. Injections show the existence of blood-vessels, which accompany the convolutions of the lympha- tics in the glands. But no nerves have been found either in the glands or their capsules. The white matter described by Haller and Bi- chat is not contained in the cellular substance, but in the cells of the lymphatic vessels them- selves. Section II. 1. a. The lymphatic glands as organized bodies may be supposed to be liable to ordinary inflamma- tion. Yet on this subject no very precise facts are given. The swelling called buho, {^ovQav, Hippo- crates) appears to be in most cases inflammation of the capsule and surrounding cellular substance. j3. Strumous hijlammatioti. The glands, how- ever, appear to be liable to a slow chronic inflam- mation, which does not readily suppurate, and which, when it does suppurate, always forms a bad and tedious disease. They are believed to be often affected in scrofulous subjects; and the definition of the evil {struma, scrofula, les ecrouelles,^ has been taken directly from this phenomenon. In such af- fections these bodies undoubtedly become the seat of a slow inflammatory action, which is attended with 3

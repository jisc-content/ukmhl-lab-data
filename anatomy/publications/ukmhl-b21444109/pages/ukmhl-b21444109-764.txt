GENERAL ANATOMY. 740 be generally shown to consist of two folds of the single membrane produced beyond the inclosed organ, but still maintaining the unity of the mem- brane. Of these prolongations, the most distinct examples are the epiplooti and the appendices epiploicee of the peritonaeum. Less manifest in- stances are the adipose folds of the pleura near the mediastinum, and the bladder-like appearance at the base of the heart, within the pericardium. The synovial fringes in the interior of the synovial membranes, which belong to a subsequent head, are nevertheless of the same general character. Between the folds of these productions there is invariably more or less adipose substance, which indeed is observed in some quantity in various parts of the filamentous tissue on the outer sur- face of the serous membranes in general. Every serous membrane I have above repre- sented as a hollow sac everywhere continuous, and the outer surface of which has no communi- cation with the inner. To this character the only exception is the peritonaeum in the female, which is perforated at two points, cori'esponding to the upper extremity or orifice of the Fallopian or oviferous tubes. This has been already mention- ed as the only spot at which the mucous and serous surfaces communicate directly with each other. Every serous membrane may be described as consisting of a very thin, colourless, transparent web or pellicle, through which the tissue of the subjacent organ or parts may be easily recog- nized ; and every serous membrane presents two

After death much serous fluid flows from the theca; the ves- sels of the chord are distended and numerous ; in all instances serous fluid is effused ; and sometimes piu'e blood issues from its capillaries. |3, That the capillary system of the lungs is overloaded and oppressed in all fevers is one of the most certain points in pathology.

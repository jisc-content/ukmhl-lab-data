BEAIN. 355 nor even the whole of the restiform bodies partake of it. It is sufficient, however, to establish a com- munication between the right and left halves of this part of the spinal chord. It was seen by Tiedemann in the fourth and fifth weeks of uterine life. The interior fibres of these bodies are longitu- dinal, and proceed partly to the cerebellum, part- ly to the protuberance. The deep-seated layer is partly interwoven with the transverse circular fibres of this body, in the same manner in which those of the pyramidal eminences are, partly bends up to the peduncles of the cerebellum, with the bands of which they are then combined. The superficial layer is connected chiefly with the sub- stance of the corpora quadrigemina, (Die Vierhu- gel,) which constitute the upper sui'face of the protuberance. The structure of the olivary body is more com- plex. Though its surface consists of longitudinal fibres, which, like those of the other eminences, are lost in the protuberance, these form a sort of su- perficial covering to a capsule of gray matter ar- ranged in a serrated form, inclosing a nucleus of white. This arrangement constitutes a ciliary or moriform body, {corpns ciliare, c. dentatum, c. rhomhoideum,) precisely similar to that in the white trunks of the cerebellum, to which, therefore, the olivary eminence approaches in organization. The longitudinal fibres of these several parts passing through the protuberance are observed beyond this body to be in direct continuation with

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 151 been also improperly given the individual bodies. The simplest, and perhaps the most correct view of this process, shows that it consists of three dis- tinct stages, which it is important for the patho- logist to know. a. The first of these consists in effusion of lymph from capillary arteries in irregular glo- bules or masses. The extent to which this exu- dation takes place will depend on the extent of the surface and the degree of inflammation ; and the same principles will regulate the appearance of the globules or masses of lymph in the different points of the granulating surface. h. After these globules have been effused and coagulated they are soon penetrated with vessels which, according to Hunter, may be justly esteem- ed mere prolongations of the capillaries which originally secreted the lymph. This penetration of vessels constitutes what may be considered the se- cond stage of granulation. This process, which must have been observed by many practical surgeons, has been clearly and correctly described by Hun- ter. " I have often," says he, " been able to trace the growth and vascularity of this new sub- stance. I have seen on a sore a white substance exactly similar to coagulating lymph. I have not attempted to wipe it off, and the next day of dres- sing I have found this very substance vascular; for by wiping or touching it with a probe it has bled freely." And, again, " The vessels of granu- lations pass from the original parts, whatever

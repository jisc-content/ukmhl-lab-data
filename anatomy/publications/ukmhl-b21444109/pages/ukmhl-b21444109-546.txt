GENERAL ANATOMY. 524 pen to the ligaments of any joint, it is most fre- quently seen in those of temporo-maxillary and sca- pulo-humeral articulations. Distortions of the spine are ascribed by Dr Harrison to relaxation of the vertebral ligaments. But if this be the cavise, it is mex'ely as the effect of previous disease ; and it is quite inadequate to produce the extreme deformi- ty so frequently observed in the vertebral column of young persons. On the new or accidental production of the fi- brous system in other tissues, much has of late years been written by Bichat, Bayle, Laennec, and other foreign authors. Without positively deny- ing the principle, that the fibrous system may be accidentally developed, I think with Meckel, that in general these new products partake of the car- tilaginous character. The notice of them, there- fore, will more conveniently be introduced under that head, CFIAPTER XVIL Yellow Fibrous System. Ligamenta Flava; Ligamentum JVnchce. Tissu Fibreux jaune, Beclard. The yellow ligaments {ligamentaflava) which connect the spinous processes of the vertebrae to each other differ considerably from the articular ligaments and the periosteum, and suggested to Beclard the necessity of establishing a particular

BONE. 555 cient nutrition in the part broken off, which is then certainly less freely supplied by blood-ves- sels. (J. Bell, Sir A. Cooper.) Further, in fractures in which there is much contusion and comminution, and especially where it is complicated by a communicating wound of the soft parts, reunion is rarely complete. The suppurative inflammation which then succeeds precludes the adhesive and ossific, and generally renders the latter imperfect or entirely abortive. In such circumstances more or less of the bone dies, and is thrown off in dead splinters. In some in- stances even necrosis may be produced, as is exem- plified in compound fractures produced by gunshot. Even in simple fracture may occur a variety of incomplete union. In some subjects, in whom the fragments have been badly applied, in whom they have been often moved, or in whom the ves- sels are inadequate to assume the ossific action, though blood and lymph are effused from the periosteum and medullary vessels, and undergo coagulation, adhesion is only partial and imper- fect. It is not penetrated by vessels so as to be- come organized ; or those vessels are rent asunder by repeated motions. Under such circumstances, the intermediate substance, instead of acquiring solidity, and becoming penetrated by bone, is partly absorbed ; while the broken ends are con- verted into a secreting surface, which discharges serous, purulent or sero-purulent fluid in small quantity. This forms what is termed false joint. In the pregnant, or persons labouring under

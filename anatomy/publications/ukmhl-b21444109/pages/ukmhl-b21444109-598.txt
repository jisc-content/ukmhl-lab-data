GENERAL ANATOMY. 574 was extenuated, and in some parts broken. The interior structure consisted of irregular bony- masses, fibrous and cellular, or cavernous, con- taining reddish semifluid jelly. The contiguous articulations were ankylosed. These changes depend doubtless on morbid action of the medul- lary web. Any change in the structure of the bone and periosteum in such circumstances is secondary. A similar case is given by Scarpa, (Tab. 6.) c. The third source of disease in the osseous tex- ture is the articular synovial membranes and car- tilages. Inflammation of the first soon passes to the second, in which it causes erosion or ul- cerative absorption. From the cartilage this may proceed progressively to the epiphyses, the upper surface of which is sooner or later exca- vated into numerous holes or caverns of various size and shape. This process, which I refer to the vessels passing from the cartilage to the me- dullary web of the epiphyses, is accompanied with deep-seated aching pain, particularly distressing during the night. It is very common in that form of disease of the joints which ai'ises from inflammation of the synovial membrane and car- tilages ; and several instances are recorded by au- thors.* It occurs in the hip-joint and knee-joint especially, and is one of the preliminary steps to ankylosis. I have seen this take place in the knee- joint, and have ascertained the point by dissection. This also is one of the modes in which the * See Cheston, who delineates two examples of it, and is at some pains to distinguish it from spina ventosa.

404 GENERAL ANATOMY. found in some part of the substance of the brain, and the vessels are much, sometimes exceedingly injected with fluid blood. When the effusion is not copious, or dependent upon very general injection of the cerebral ves- sels, nor takes place suddenly, or in a vital part of the brain ; or if the injection is thereby, or by other means moderated; then further changes take place, and continue until the natural struc- ture of the organ is so much altered that life can no longer be continued. The effused blood, both when fluid, and especially after coagulation, acts as a foreign body,—breaks down, softens, and disorganizes the part with which it is in contact. After some time the clot begins to change, as- sumes a brown or brownish-black colour, and is separated into fragments floating in a wine-lee fluid. The further dissolution of these forms a homogeneous chocolate-coloured matter, which is eventually removed more or less perfectly; * while the part, which the extravasation convert- ed into a hollow, is filled with serous fluid, and softened or pulpy cerebral matter. In some cas- • " The appearance of the effused blood differs according to the duration of its effusion. When death ensues quickly, at the end of three or four days for example, it is in the form of soft blackish clots. After a month or six weeks it becomes firmer, assumes a deep-brown colour, and resembles the blood of aneurismal tumours. At a more remote period it becomes still more compact and of a pale red colour, bor- dering on ochreous yellow. Lastly, it is entirely absorbed." —Rochoux, p. 86.

538 GENEKAI> ANATOMY. The developement or progressive formation of the osseous system has given rise to many inte- resting researches by Kerckringius, Vater,* Bas- ter, f Duhamel, t Nesbitt, § Haller, || Dethleef, ^ Reichel, Albinus, ** Scarpa, John Hunter, f f Senff,tt Howship,^^ Meckel, nil Troja, Medici, Serres, Lebel, Schultze, Beclard, and Dutrochet; and it is perhaps a proof of the difficult and com- plicated nature of the subject, that it still con- tinues to give rise to fresh investigation. The inquiry naturally resolves itself into two parts,— the history of the process of ossification as it takes place originally in the foetus and infant, and the history of its progress as a process of repair when bones are divided, broken, or otherwise destroyed or removed. From the first formation of the embryo to the termination of foetal existence, and thenceforth to * De Osteogenia Natural! et Praeternaturali. Haller^ Disput. Anat., Vol. vi. p. 22?. t De Osteogenia.

There is little doubt that the fibro-cartilages are liable to inflammation, either originally com- mencing in their own substance, or communicat- ed to them from contiguous parts, especially syno- vial membrane, with which many of them are in- vested. Suppuration of that which forms the symphysis pubis was seen by a friend of Hunter, * and by Ludovici, in the person of a puerperal fe- male. This was the effect of excessive stretching during labour. In other instances they are torn asunder, so as to cause diastasis, without suppura- tion. In one instance separation of this kind ap- pears to have been congenital. Palletta and Bro- die have described a variety of vertebral disease which always commences with, and sometimes consists in erosion of the intervertebral cartilages ; and most surgeons have seen the semilunar car- tilages of the knee-joint inflamed and eroded. The intervertebral fibro-cartilages have been found softened, swollen, and distended with fluid. Ossification is not uncommon, and in those of the sacro-iliac and pubal junctions (symphyses), is re- marked in adults, or those advanced in life so fre- quently, that it cannot be regarded as disease. In the vertebrae it is also observed, though less frequently. It has been seen most generally in the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, which are thus indissolubly ankylosed.

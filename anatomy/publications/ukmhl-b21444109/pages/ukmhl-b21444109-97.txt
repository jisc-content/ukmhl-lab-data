ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 77 â€¢dense filamentous or cellular membrane, which is very firmly attached to it, and which was former- ly considered as part of the arterial tissue. It is adventitious ; a modification of filamentous or cel- lular texture which establishes a communication between the artery and the contiguous parts, and is necessary to the nutrition and healthy state of the vessel. It incloses and transmits the minute vessels anciently denominated vasa vasorum, (ar- terioles arteriarum, Haller ;) and if detached even through a trifling extent, the arterial portion thus divided is sure to become dead ; to be affected with inflammatory and sloughing action; and ul- timately to give way and discharge the contents of the vessel. M. Beclard considers it a fibro- cellular membrane, which may in the larger arte- ries be divided into two layers, one exterior, simi- lar to the general filamentous tissue ; the other inside between the outer layer and the proper tis- sue, yellowish and firm, but still sufficiently dis- tinct from the proper tunic. In the cerebral ar- teries it is wanting, and in most parts of the chest and belly its absence is supplied by a portion of pericardium, pleura, or peritonaeum. Yet even there a thin layer of fine cellular tissue appears to connect these membranes to the proper tunic. In the extremities the cellular sheath is removed in dissecting arterial preparations. At different periods several anatomists have maintained the existence of longitudinal fibres in arterial tissue ; and even at the present day this

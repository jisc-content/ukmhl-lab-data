Suppuration especially, is not a constant, or is rather an exceedingly rare occurrence, and is to be regarded as adventitious, or depending upon accidental peculiarities and idiosyncrasies, and not essential. The overloaded state of the capillaries, though taking place in those of the organ itself, is nevertheless more remarkable, according to my observation, in those of the proper cerebral mem- brane. 5. Ulceration; Erosion. From the various forms of pulpy destruction and abscess, the transi- tion to ulceration is easy. By this is understood destruction of part of either of the surfaces of the brain, so as to present a hollow or depressed sur- face, rough, irregular, and covered partially either with bloody or albuminous exudation. In the for- mer case its claim to the character of a genuine ulcer may be doubtful, since it may be viewed as the residue of a partial effusion of blood. It is possible that this may have been the origin of the case of erosion of the corpus sh iatum described by Morgagni, in which that body is said to have been entirely detached from the brain ; * and I think it is next to certain this was the cause of the ul- cerous cavity, f which he shortly after states was found in the base of the left ventricle of another case. This is almost admitted by Morgagni him- self, who regards these ulcers as ruptured cavities * Epist. xi. 2. r Ibid. 4.

150 GENERAL ANATOMY. whether occurring spontaneously, in consequence of bruise or laceration, or the introduction of foreign bodies. In each of these cases, though suppuration should also take place, still there is lymph effused, and this lymph is penetrated by newly formed capil- laries. This formation of new capillaries is termed by the French pathologists accidental detelopement of the capillar]) system. Is it lymph of a pecuhar kind that is effused from the capillaries of fractured bones in the first stage of the process of reunion ? The substance named callus is certainly not car- tilage, as was anciently supposed, and possesses qualities not unlike those of the lymph of soft tissues. Is lymph effused from the fragments of a broken cartilage, or a ruptured tendon ? In each of these cases of injury a soft homogeneous fluid, pale x*ed or blviish, is effused immediately or soon after the injury; and in each it seems to possess the same qualities, and only in the course of the process of reunion to be afterwards pene- trated by the peculiar matter of the tissue injured. A preliminary step to this penetration of proper substance is uniformly the formation of new ca- pillary arteries and veins. In those examples of spontaneous disease or in- jvuy in which suppuration takes place, the capil- laries in depositing lymph are concerned in another process, the formation of red eminences, hemi- spherical or hemispheroidal, of various size, and varying in firmness or consistence. This process has been termed gramdation, a name which has

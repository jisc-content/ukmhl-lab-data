GENERAL ANATOMY. 114 specific gravity of the matter of the vena cava being invariably greater than that of the aorta in the same subject, both in man and in brute ani- mals. From some experiments Magendie is disposed to consider it of a fibrinous character. But it ex- hibits in the living body no proof of muscular structure or irritable power. When punctured by a sharp instrument, or exposed to the electric or galvanic action, it undergoes no change or sensi- ble motion. This tunic is wanting in those divisions of the venous system termed sinuses, in which its place is supplied by portions of the hard membrane; {dura meninx.) 2, The inner surface of any vein which has been laid open and well washed is found to be smooth, highly polished, and of a bluish or blue-white co- lour. This is the inner or free surface of the in- ner venous membrane, imemhrana intima.) It is exceedingly thin, much more so than the cor- responding arterial membrane, much more disten- sible and less fragile. It bears a very tight liga- ture without giving way as the arterial does ; but it also sustains considerable weight, which shows that it is tough and resisting. This is the mem- brane termed by Bichat common membrane of dark or modena blood. According to the views of this anatomist it forms the inner or free surface not only of all the venous twigs, branches, and trunks composing this system of vessels, but it is extend-

GENERAL ANATOMY. 32 munication. Thus along the median line it is so firm, that air injected invariably stops, unless im- pelled by a force adequate to tear open its fila- ments, and water is rarely found effused in this situation. In the neighbourhood of some parts of the skeleton also, as at the crest of the ilium, over the great trochanter, and on the shin, the filamentous tissue is very dense and coherent. In chemical composition it consists principally of gelatin, but contains some albuminous matter. Section II. The filamentous tissue is liable to inflamma- tion, acute and chronic, circumscribed, and with exudation of lymph, or diffusive and spreading, generally without this exudation, and with the production of purulent matter; to induration ; to hemorrhage; to serous infiltration; to aerial distension ; and to new growths. 1. Inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue when circumscribed constitutes phlegmon, a name applied rather in reference to our observa- tion of it near the surface of the body, than with a view to the natural relation between an orga- nized texture and its pathological processes. In other situations, as it is seldom recognized before it has passed to the stage of suppuration, inflammation of ceUular tissue is generally implied in those abscesses or collections of purulent matter.

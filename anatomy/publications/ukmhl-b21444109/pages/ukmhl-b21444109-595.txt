Spina ventosa never occurs in a bone with distinct medullary canal, unless at the epiphyses, where the structure is cancellated. When it takes place in these situations, it first in- duces enlargement of the epiphyses, with extreme pain deep in the bone. Soon after the periosteum becomes thick and swelled ; and in no long time sanious matter is found beneath it issuing from the cancelli, which are then softened, partially de- stroyed, and excavated. If in this state such a bone be examined, the broken cancelli are filled with a reddish, soft, spongy vascular mass, producing flabby granulations passim, and secreting bloody sanious fluid. The compact shell is partly de- stroyed by irregular ulceration, and partly ex- truded by the distending force of the swelled me- dullary web. The diseased epiphysis then pre- sents a large irregular anfractuous cavern filled with soft spongy substance, which is either the web itself, or the new products which its inflam- mation has generated.* In this manner it is fre- quent in the upper end of the tibia or the lower end of the femur, or in the extremities of the ra- dius or ulna. With deference therefore to the observation and assiduity of Mr Howship, I cannot agree Avith this author, that spina ventosa is an enlarge- ment affecting the cylindrical bones, unless with * See Observations on the Morbid Appearances and Struc- ture of Bones, &c.

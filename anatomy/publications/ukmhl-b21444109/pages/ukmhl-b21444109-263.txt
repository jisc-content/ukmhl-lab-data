LYMPHATIC GLANn OR GANGLION. !i241 and usual situation of these bodies, are well known and described in the common treatises on anatomy. In general they are spheroidal, seldom quite glo- bular, and most commonly their shape is that of a flattened spheroid. In different subjects, and in subjects at different ages, they vary from two or three lines to an inch in diameter. The medium rate is about half an inch. Their surface is smooth; their colour grayish-pink, sometimes pale red, bluish, or of a peach-blossom tinge,—varieties which seem to depend on degrees of bloody tran- sudation; for when washed and slightly macerated, they assume the gray or whitish-blue colour. In a few instances they are jet black,—a peculiarity which seems to depend on a degree of black infil- tration, or on the incipient stage of that change ^vhich has been termed melanosis, or melanotic ieposition. The idea that it may be derived from the carbonaceous matter suspended in the atmo- sphere of great cities, has been shown by Cruick- shank to be absurd. Its anatomical possibility nay be justly questioned. They are always situate in the ceUuloso-adi- )ose tissue found in the flexures of the joints, rhey are found in small number at the bend of he ham, and that of the elbow; they are more nu- nerous in the arm-pit and groin; in considerable mmber in the cellular tissue of the lumbar re- gion, before the psoas and iliacus muscles; and hey are most abundant round the neck. The po- iterior mediastinum, and the cellular tissue be- ween the mesentery and vertebral column, a

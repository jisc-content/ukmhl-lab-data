GENERAL ANATOMY. 34>0 rally in connection with the tract, it bears some remote resemblance. It is broader, larger, and more convex than the inner eminence, and is evi- dently the chief origin of the optic tract. The eminence on the inside of the linear furrow is much smaller, and often less distinctly marked than the outer. In ordinary circumstances it may be described as an eminence of cerebral matter contained between two circular segments, in such manner that its longitudinal extent, which is near- ly vertical, is greater than its transverse. It is obviously connected with the smaller limb of the optic tract. Whether this body actually takes its origin from the four eminences {corpora quadri- gemina,) depends on evidence of a different de- scription. The inner or mesial side of the geniculate bo- dies is contiguous to the four eminences, and is separated from them by a linear furrow. These eminences occupy the upper surface of the protu- berance, and partly that of the limbs of the brain; and the linear furrow marks the point at which the limbs issue from the substance of the optic couches. The lower surface, indeed, of these bo- dies, presents the long thick cylinder of the limbs; and while they occupy this conspicuous situation, and a considerable proportion of the lower surface, it is impossible to assign them more cerebral space above, than that occupied by the upper two of the four eminences (nates,) and the adjoining part of the optic couch.

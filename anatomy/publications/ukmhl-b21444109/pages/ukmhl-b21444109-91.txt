The sti'ucture of the arteries lias been so much the subject of examination at all periods of the history of anatomy, that to mention the authors by whom it has been described would be much the same as to enumerate all the anatomists who have ever written. To omit Galen, and some of those who wrote shortly after the revival of litera- ture, descriptions of the structure of arteries have been given with different degrees of minuteness and accuracy by Willis, Vieussens, Verheyen, Lancisi, Bidloo, the first Monro, Morgagni, Lud- wig, Haller, De La Sone, Bichat, Gordon, Ma- gendie, and by Mondini.

The following account is derived principally

166 GENERAL ANATOMY. which in the sound state of that texture are in- visible. In the skin it is very M'ell established by incisions made in the treatment of boil and car- buncle. In both cases, if the incision be carried through either timiour, much more blood is dis- charged from the point where ulceration is esta- blished than at any other part. The same fact is demonstrated by the appearance of ulcerated patches of the intestinal mucous membrane. In the process of ulceration it is generally pos- sible to trace a final intention or definite purpose, after the accomplishment of which it ceases spon- taneously. It takes place imder circumstances in which it is requisite to remove some part of a texture which is either unsound, or has become foreign to the system, as in the case of dead bones, mortified sloughs; or to procure an outlet for some morbid fluid, as is seen in deep purulent collec- tions ; or to expel a foreign body from a situation in which its presence is injurious. Hence it has been justly remarked by Hunter, that every pro- cess of ulceration is preceded by adhesive inflam- mation at one or more points, sometimes round the whole line along which the ulcerating process takes place. The object of this is to prevent he- morrhage by the closure of vessels, and to prevent the diffiision of purident fluid in situations where its presence would be injurious. In several situa- tions, however, it fails to accomplish this purpose. When the ulcerative process has effected the object for which it was connnenced, a new mode

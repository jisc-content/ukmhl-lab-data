It will be seen that it consists of successive portions of that figurate surface, proceeding from the mesial plane, on each side to the lower and outer margin of the cerebral limbs. It will be seen, that, if we begin at the longitudinal furrow of the four eminences, we find first the upper eminence of one side ; then the contiguous part of the optic couch ; then the greater geniculate eminence ; after this, as the cylindroid process pursues its winding and revo- lute course, the outer part of the cerebral limb; and, lastly, the outer and lower angle of that limb. Not only, however, does the convoluted surface of the brain communicate with the figurate one, but the laminated surface of the cerebellum com- municates with the analogous surface of that or- gan, and thus with the great figurate surface. This communication takes place on the middle plane, below the transverse or middle plates which form the pyramid, uvula, and nodule, and between these bodies and the restiform processes. This is the fourth ventricle of anatomical writers; and as it has never been denied that it communi- cates with the outer surface of the cerebellum, it is lioticed here merely as an integrant part of those views which I apply to the organ at large. The central or figurate surface exposed in the

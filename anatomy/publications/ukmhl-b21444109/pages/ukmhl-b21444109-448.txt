The spinal chord is liable to the same species of vascular injection and hemorrhage which takes place in the brain. The capillaries, which, in the sound or normal state, are small, and convey al- most colourless fluid, become enlarged and pene- trated with red blood. In a stage of the process, which is to be regarded as further advanced, drops of blood, and occasionally clots of some magnitude, are found deposited in the substance of the chord. These undergo and give rise to the same changes which have been already described as taking place in the brain, and are a cause by no means unfrequent of pulpy disorganization of the chord. In the case given by Gaultier de Claubry, which is the most distinct on record, the chord opposite the seventh cervical vertebra was of a deep-red colour from vascular injection, but still unbroken in structure; from the seventh cervical vertebra to the third dorsal it was not only deep-red on the surface, but in the substance, and so soft as to sink under the knife or finger ; and from the third dorsal vertebra to the lower part of the sacrum, it was a red blood-coloured pulp destitute of organization.* The cases of Chevalier, which â€¢ Journal General de Medecine de Chirurgie et de Pharma- cie,&c. 12iemeannee,Tome XXXII.

BONE. 549 its original connection with the alveolar mem- brane, by the minute vascular production which enters the orifice or orifices of the root. Physiological authors have thought it import- ant to mark the period at which the teeth appear at the gums ; and in general this takes place about the sixth or seventh month after birth. This mode of viewing the process of dentition, however, gives rise to numberless mistakes on the period of teeth- ing. The process, as we see, commences in the early period of foetal existence; and the time at which they appear above the gums varies according to the progress made in the womb. In some the process is rapid ; in others it is tardy ; and even the fabulous stories of Richard III. and Louis XIV. may be understood physiologically, without the aid of the marvellous. Generally speaking, the crown is completed at the period of birth ; and, according as the foi-mation of the root advances with rapidity or slowly, dentition is early or late. What is here described is the process of the formation of the first or temporary set of teeth, which consist, it is well known, of twenty. In that of the second set the same course is observed. In the same manner is observed a row of follicu- lar sacs, though not exactly in the original alveoli; in the same manner deposition begins at the bot- tom of the free surface of the sac by the forma- tion of the crown; and in the same manner the crown is forcibly raised by the successive accre- tion of new matter to its base. The moment this.

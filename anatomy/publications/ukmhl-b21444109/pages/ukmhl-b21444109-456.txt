434 GENERAL ANATOMY. in the annular protuberance, and in the olivary eminences. It is impossible to say when the or- gan may be said to attain its maximum of firm- ness. Bvit after the 22d year I have not been able, in a very considerable number of human brains, to recognize much variation of consistence not connected with some morbid state, either of the system at large, or of the organ itself. In extreme old age, it has been said the brain generally becomes firmer, harder, and drier than in the meridian of life. This, I believe, is not al- together without foundation ; though it is doubt- ful how far this is to be regarded as a uniform change, independent of disease or morbid effects. It is further exceedingly difficult to define the time at which this change in the consistence of the brain commences, or is accomplished. In per- sons between 50 and 60, I have seen the brain as firm as in others between 70 and 80, or above that age. Conversely, the brain is found some- times soft, even in persons much advanced in life. The brain of the adult is liable to lose its nor- mal consistence, and become preternaturally soft in chronic diseases of emaciation, as dropsy, pul- monary consumption, and other pulmonary dis- orders, mesenteric wasting, marasmus, diabetes, and organic diseases in general. The diminish- ed consistence now remarked is most frequently observed in dropsy, diabetes, and pulmonary dis- orders. In the first the brain is almost invariably soft

GENERAL AN ATOM V. 500 and adipose below. The fat into which these muscles were changed is described as white, firm, contained in numerous minute cells ; the uniting cellular tissue whitish, looser, and more separable than usual; and the fat is not deposited between its filaments, but forms part of their substance. Examined by a good glass, it presents a mass of soft transparent fibres of various diameters, in different parts of their length. * Dumas saw the muscles of the fore part of the chest, and those of the po- sterior region of the shoulder and arm, reduced to an adipose mass, contained in condensed cellular membrane ; those of the abdomen and the triceps adductor much changed ; and the glutaeus maxi- mus and first adductor half changed into fatty matter.f Emmanuel, in the person of a woman of 38, dead of child-bed fever, found the abdominal muscles entirely changed into fat. :j: Lastly, it was seen by Laennec and Adams in the human heart. The changed portions assume a pale yellow colour, which is most distinct exter- nally, and approaches to the natural tint as it pro- ceeds inwards, at which the muscular fibres are less changed. According to an analysis by Cruveil- hier it consists of solid adipocerous fat, oily fluid, {elaine,) and a little gelatine. 5. Elongation and shortening of muscular fibres are mentioned among morbid changes. 6. Rupture or laceration.â€”Of this occurrence in * Journal General de Medecine, Tome xxiv. p. 11- f Ibid.

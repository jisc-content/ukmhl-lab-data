FILAMENTOUS OH CELI,UI,AK TISSUE. 35 Ian, and even later, every spreading inflammation was termed ei'ysipelatous, whether it existed in skin, mucous membrane, serous membrane, or cel- lular tissue; and the character of nomenclature was derived, not from the texture, but from the supposed nature of the morbid process. This prac- tice, if not positively wrong, was attended with confusion in arrangement and description ; and it is well that the general usage of correct patholo- gists has now restricted the term to inflammation of a particular tissue. The second source of con- fusion in the views of Hunter consisted in his re- garding the exudation of lymph as an invariable barrier against the diffusion of the morbid pro- cess. This exudation doubtless constitutes the character of the limited form of inflammation ; but Hunter appears to have forgotten that, in certain circumstances, as in the sort of inflammation now considered, this barrier does not exist, and the morbid process therefore spreads, or is diffused over the membrane. It is further evident from what he says, (p. 271, 272, and 367,) that he re- garded the spreading inflammation of the cellular membrane as erysipelas attacking that tissue, and that he considered its pathological peculiarity to consist in the absence of lymphy effusion, and the consequent want of limitation. Though it may be disputing about a name only, to question this, it is perhaps better to regard this form of inflamma- tion as entirely different from erysipelas, which must be referred to the outer surface of the co-

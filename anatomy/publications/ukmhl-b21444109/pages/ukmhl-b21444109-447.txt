BRAIN. 425 takes place, show, that it is not so much the destruc- tion of the cerebral substance as the capillary in- jection or inflammation with which it is attended, that produces the loss of power in the muscles of voluntary" motion. In some instances of para- lytic disorder lasting for a considerable time, in- stead of finding hemorrhagic cavities or destroyed spots in the brain, it is impossible to recognize any thing but some vascular injection and effu- sion of serous fluid, which doubtless proceeded from the overloaded vessels. This injection is not confined to one spot, but is diffused in different degrees through the brain, and is in some instan- ces strongly marked in the cerebellum, annular protuberance, and the meningeal vessels towards the base of the organ. The effects which this state of the brain produces vary somewhat from genuine apoplectic palsy. They constitute a dou- ble but unequal hemiplegy, approaching very gra- dually, and very often simulating paraplegia. From this, however, they differ, in the lower ex- tremities being seldom affected in the same de- gree and at an equal rate. It is often attended with some loss of memory, or sensation, and some slight degree of mental imbecillity. The anato- mical character of the disease may be represented as a chronic congested state of the cerebral capil- laries. It may terminate either in serous effusion from the meningeal vessels, in softening of the ce- rebral substance, or in induration. In the first instance, it belongs to the head of meningeal injec- tion, to be afterwards noticed. In the second case.

270 GENERAL ANATOMY. scarcely perceptible ; all are continuous with the nerve or nerves above and below the ganglion. It appears that the nervous chord, when it enters the one apex of the ganglion, begins to be sepa- rated into its component threads, which diverge and form intervals, between which the delicate cellular tissue is interposed ; and that these fila- ments are subsequently collected at the opposite extremity of the ganglion, where they are con- nected with the other nerve or nerves. Scarpa, to whom we are indebted for most of the know- ledge we possess on this subject, * compares the arrangement to a rope, the component cords of which are vintwisted and teased out at a certain part. Lastly, In the simple ganglions, the fila- ments of which they consist invariably follow the axis of the ganglion; but in the compound ones they ai*e found to rise towards the sides and emerge from them; and upon this variety in the direction and course of these filaments depends the variety of figure for which these two orders of ganglions are remarkable. These nervous threads (stamina s.Jila nervea) described by Scarpa, cor- respond to the medullary filaments (fila medul- laria) of Wutzer. According to this anatomist these filaments, when about to enter the ganglion, lay aside their neurilem ; yet they are sufficiently tough to resist a certain degree of tension. Wutzer mentions a cluster of vesicles or cells (cancelU) in the filamentous tissue of the gan- â€¢ Anatomicarum Annotationura Liber Primus de Ner- vorum Gangliis et Plexubus. Auct. Ant. Scarpa.

NERVOUS I'lSSUE. 287 rived nearly at the same general result, and assert that nervous filaments may be traced through the new matter of the cicatrix. According to Arnemann, who describes the pro- cess of reunion particularly, shortly after sec- tion, the end of the upper portion of cut nerve inflames and swells, forming a grayish, long, and hard knot; the end of the lower portion under- goes the same change, but in less degree ; the knotty parts unite; and the substance which thus connects the cut portions of nerve, though it con- tinues hard and large, is considered as either ner- vous matter, or as containing a considerable por- tion of that substance, for the sensations and mo- tions of the parts are in most cases restored short- ly after union. This process, according to Bichat, therefore, consists of four stages. 1*/, After incision the cut ends inflame, and its capillaries effuse coagulating or organizable lymph, which is penetrated with blood-vessels. This effusion, which takes place chiefly from the neurilema, forms a sort of cellu- lar tissue, in which nervous matter is afterwards deposited. This cellular tissvie, and the new mat- ter in general, is in quantity according to the spaces to be filled up. If it be large, the new matter is augmented by successive effusion and granula- tion ; and when small, the connection by deposi- tion appears to be very speedily effected. 3J, The adhesion of the individual granulating bodies and consolidation of the part.

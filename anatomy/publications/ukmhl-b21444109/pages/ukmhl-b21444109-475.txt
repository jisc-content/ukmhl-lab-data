Instead of the usual appearance of ramified ar- rangement, which had disappeared, was one of parallel white streaks, firm, {scirrhosa), of a uniform colour, ap- proaching to pale carnation ; and when minutely examined appearing to consist of roundish atoms, mutually aggregated^ without membrane or blood-vessel. This change, which af- fected the whole left hemisphere, encroached a little only on the right. La Peyronie, Memoires de I'Academie Royale des Sciences, 1741. P. 208, 4to, 283, 12mo.—A man of 30, who for ten years passed for a melancholy hypochondriac, complained during the three last months of life of weight and pains of the head towards the occipital region and neck; had convul- sions about half an hour in all the members; and two days after perished in a fresh attack, lasting only a quarter of an hour. Attached to the fourth ventricle was a hard tumour as large as a hen's egg, occupying the place of the cerebel- lum, which was reduced to a glairy membrane as thin as a line, investing the tumour. This tumour, which compressed the tubercula quadrigemina, appears to have been attached to the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle, and probably grew from it originally. Brisseau mentions a hard tumour, as large as a pigeon's egg, in the middle of the cerebellum, producing palsy—Obs. iii. p. 27- From this list, which contains, if not the whole, at least the most authentic cases of this form of ce- rebral tumour, it may be inferred, that it consists in a portion of brain becoming unusually hard, assuming a white or yellow white tint, and in losing much of its appearance of organization, es- pecially fibrous structure and vascular ramifica- tion. The hardness of these tumours varies from that of granular cheesy matter to firm indurated

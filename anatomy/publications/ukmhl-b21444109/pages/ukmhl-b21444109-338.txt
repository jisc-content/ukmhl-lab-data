316 GENERAL ANATOMY. gata) has been removed. It will then be perceiv- ed that each almond is bounded on the outside by a well-marked circular furrow, which separates it from the biventral lobe on the inside by a free surface directed to the corresponding surface of the opposite almond; and before, by a continua- tion of this directed outwards toward the biven- tral lobe. I have already said that the direction of the constituent plates of this body is peculiar. In general they observe a direction opposite to that of the biventral plates ; so that, if produced, they would cross. Its apex or most pointed cor- ner is contiguous to that of the biventral lobe; and altogether, each almond presents the appear- ance, on a cursory glance, of two similar bodies directed inversely to each other. The last body which I shall notice here is the Flock or Flocks. The description of its situation, as given by Malacarne, is by no means clear; but perusal of the context, with examination of the parts described, can leave no doubt on the cer- tainty of the object which he has in view. The flock {il Jioccho, il JioccM, Die Flocken,) is a mi- nute body, of a shape not easily defined, situate in the angular hollow between the biventral lobe, and the branch or peduncle {crus, gamha, hraccia. Die Arme) of the small brain. The lower or free surface of the latter object (the branch) possesses an anterior and posterior margin or corner. The latter is contiguous to the biventral lobe, from which it is separated by a small furrow, out of

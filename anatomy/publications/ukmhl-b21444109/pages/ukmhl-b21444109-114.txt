Calcareous deposition may take place at any period of life, but is supposed to be most common in advanced age. Portal, Scarpa, and Hodgson, mention instances of its occurrence in young sub- jects. According to Stevens, it is more common to find the arteries ossified than healthy after the 30th year. * But this statement is probably de- livered in too general terms, and from too limited a collection of cases. Baillie restricts its occur- rence as a general phenomenon to the period after the 60th year ; f and this corresponds with the inference of Bichat, who states, that in ten sub- jects seven at least present these incrustations after the 60th year. :j: Its influence on the circulation varies at different periods of life, and according to its extent and situation.

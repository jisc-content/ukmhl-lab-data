ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 83 but indistinct on the opposite side where the angle is obtuse. 3d, If the angle is acute, and that formed by the branch with the continuation of the trunk is obtuse, the beginning of the artery pre- sents an oblique circle, the elevated half of which is near the heart, the other more remote. The arrangement of the fibres of the proper tis- sue is described by Ludwig from the divarication of the iliac arteries, and may be seen in any part of the arterial system where the vessels are large. The circular fibres separating form on each side a half ring, from which is produced a complete ring which incloses the smaller rings formed by the cir- cular fibres of the vessel given off. These circu- lar fibres proceed to the prominence of the internal membrane already described, and are arranged round it much in the same manner in which those of the large vessel surround its inner membrane. In this, however, no continuity between the rings of the large vessel and those of the small one can be recognized. The latter are inserted as it were into the former, and they are connected by the continuity of the inner membrane only. In observing the course or transit of arterial tubes, the principal point deserving notice is the sheltered situation which they generally occupy, their tortuous course, and their mutual communi- cations. In the extremities they are always found towards the interior or least exposed part of the limb, generally deep between muscles, and some- times lying along bones. When they are minute-

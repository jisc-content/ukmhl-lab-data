This reflected portion is in truth the arachnoid membrane which lines the dura mater, passing from it along the nervous chords to form the free surface of the pia mater. In like manner, if the third pair or oculo-muscular, or fifth or tergeminal nerves, be examined at the openings at which they perforate the scull, the dura mater is found ad- hering firmly round their several margins to the bone by its outer or attached surface, while its in- ner free surface turns back on the nervous chords, and is thence continued over the pia mater. In short, the continuity of this thin transparent membrane from the dura mater to the pia mater may be traced at each of the nervous trunks as they issue from the brain through the cranial apertures. Another proof of a similar description is deriv- ed from examining the free or lower margins of the Jalx major and minor, and of the horizontal portion of the dura mater, (tentorium cerebelli). First, at the upper or convex margin of the great Jalx, where the veins pass from the pia mater to the longitudinal sinus, it is not difficult to trace the arachnoid membrane from the^^a mater along their coats, to that portion of the dura mater which forms the sinus, and conversely, from the falx along the veins to the free surface of the pia mater. In the second place, the lower, or concave margin of the falx, is connected at the bottom of the middle fissure between the hemispheres to the pia mater

BRAIN. 441 induration ; * and Lallemand f Bouillaud, :j: and Pinel, ^ have found portions of the brain indurat- ed in connection with chronic intlammation. But whether this is to be viewed as the result of ca- pillary injection or of some derangement in the process of nutrition, it is at present impossible to determine. It would be desirable to ascertain chemically the exact nature of the change which takes place, and in what respect the indurated ce- rebral matter differs from that of the normal state. It is possible that the albuminous substance may be either changed, or in greater proportion; but on this point no accurate observations have hither- to been made. Whatever be the agent or means of this change, nevertheless, enough is known to show that when it exists, it is in general accompanied with an in- jected state of the cerebral capillaries, and that it gives rise to loss of m.emory, confusion of thought, and derangement of the mental faculties. It ap- pears, indeed, to be a frequent cause of insanity, especially when permanent, without lucid inter- val ; and if long continued, it may cause that com- plete obliteration of the intellect which constitutes * Annuaire Medico-Chirurgicale. f Recherches Anatomico-Pathologiques, &c.

NERVOUS TISSUE. 279 and always without success; and I may say the same regarding the absence or non-appearance of nerves in the peritoneum and pleura. The nerves have different uses in the different organs and tissues to which they are distributed. 1. In the organs of sensation they receive the me- chanical impressions made on the mechanical part of the organ. In the eye, the retina receives the last image formed by the transmitting powers of the transparent parts. In the ear, the termina- tions of the auditory nerve are affected by the oscillations or minute changes in the fluid of the labyrinth, occasioned by the motions of the tym- panal bones. In the mucous membrane of the na- sal passages, the filaments of the olfactory nerve are affected by aromatic particles, dissolved or sus- pended in the air. In the palate, tongue, and throat, the gustatory nerves are affected by sapid bodies dissolved in the mouth, or applied in a fluid state to the mucous membrane of that cavity. 2. In the system of voluntary muscles the nerves retain the action of the muscular fibres in a state of uni- formity and equality, and keep them obedient to the will. In the involuntary muscles they ap- pear merely to keep their action equable, regular, and uniform ; and in both they maintain a com- munication, or consent, or harmony of action be- tween different parts of the same system of or- gans, or even between different organs concurring to the same function. 3. In the glandular organs the nerves certainly exercise some influence over

304 GENERAL ANATOM V commencing before with a curved outline,—the anterior end of the hemisphere, is bounded behind by the curvilinear hollow, which has been named the pit or fissure of Sylvius. It is slightly uneven, and is bounded at its inner or mesial margin by the great fissure which separates the hemispheres. This inner margin always presents one convolu- tion, which is quite uniform in direction, extent, and configuration. It consists of a longitudinal eminence, which extends in the adult brain about 1^ inch from the beginning or posterior end of the notch, towards its anterior extremity. The inner margin of the eminence, which is about four lines broad, forms the side of the fissure; and its outer margin or border is separated from the contiguous part of the convoluted surface, by a furrow or hollow equally uniform in direction and figure with the eminence,—about the same average length (1 inch 5 lines.) This furrow contains the cerebral portion of the first pair or olfacient nerves. The medio-inferior or spheno-temporal, is si- tuate immediately behind this region, from which it is separated by the curvilinear hollow. (Fossa Sylvii.) In the ordinary descriptions, this forms what has been named the middle lobe of the brain; while the posterior part of the convoluted surface, or that which corresponds to the cerebellum, though distinguished by no evident mark or limit, has been with equal impropriety named the joo*- terior lobe.

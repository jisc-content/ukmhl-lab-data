129 VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. much more serious disorder, and appears to belong essentially to the inner venous membrane. Rare- ly spontaneous, it takes place only after some vio- lence offered to the vein ; but the degrees of this may be so various, and even the kinds so different, that it is impossible to trace much analogy of ac- tion between them. Thus it may occur after a simple clean incision, as in blood-letting; after the application of a ligature, as occasionally happens in amputation, in the operation for varix, or in the umbilical chord after birth; or in consequence of pressure, as sometimes happens after the use of a tourniquet. In either case, the inflammatory ac- tion originating in a spot of the inner membrane spreads along its surface, generally towards the heart, more or less rapidly, and with much vio- lence. The pathological effects of this process vary ac- cording to its severity and extent. In general the tissue of the affected vein or veins is swelled, thickened, and indurated to such a degree as make the vessel resemble an artery. The interior is filled with purulent matter, or presents a series of abscesses along the tract of the canal; and the in- ner tunic is generally removed, the middle one not unfrequently injured by ulceration. This process is always attended with great commotion in the organs of circulation, much general fever, and more or less affection of the intellectual functions, and if considerable, generally proves fatal.

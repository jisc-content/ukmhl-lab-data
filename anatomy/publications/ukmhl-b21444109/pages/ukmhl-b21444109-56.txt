36 GENERAL ANATOMY. rion ; and to represent it as a process tending to spread without adequate effusion of coagulable lymph. Another point in the pathology of this disor- der may be here noticed. Certain facts would fa- vour the notion, that it consists in affection of the adipose membrane, as distinct from the filamen- tous tissue. Thus, diffuse inflammation occurs mostly in those parts in which the adipose mem- brane is abundant, e. g. in the neck, on the chest between the two pectoral muscles, in the arm- pits, in the extremities immediately beneath the skin, and on the buttock at the verge of the anus. In the following passage Hunter seems to have this in view, " The cellular membrane, free from the adipose, appears to be more susceptible of the adhesive inflammation than the adipose membrane, and much more readily passes into the suppurative. Thus we see that the cellular mem- brane connecting parts together as muscles, and the cellular membrane connecting the adipose to muscles, easily inflames, and runs readily into sup- puration, and, as it were, separates the muscles from their lateral connections, and even separates the adipose from the muscles, while the skin and adipose membrane shall only be highly inflamed." (P. 234.) Diffuse inflammation of the filamentous tissue has been described by Kirkland, (p. 282, Vol. II.) Willan, Thomson, and Copland Hutchinson, un- der the name of phlegmonoid erysipelas, noticed

It is not easy to apply accurate terras to denote the kind of colour; but, according to Gordon, this surface is of the wood-brown or lead-gray tinge ;* and the substance so coloured extends only one-eighth or one-tenth of an inch in depth, and is then succeeded by a tinge of orange-white substance. Of the correctness of this observation I am not assured; for if sections of the convoluted part be made, no difference can be observed in the recent brain ; and the cut sur- face appears to consist of homogeneous and uni- form gray matter, from the outer or free margin to that which adheres distinctly to the white sub- stance. The consistence of the convoluted cerebi'al sub- stance is considerable ; but it is less than those of the white matter. If we trust to the observations of Father Delia Torre, the gray and the white substance of the brain, cerebellum and spinal chord, consist of an accumulation of transparent globules, floating in a transparent crystalline, but somewhat viscid fluid, f These globules he imagined are largest in the brain, smaller in the cerebellum, and still smaller in the spinal chord. According to the observations of Prochaska, however different in colour the gray cerebral sub- â€¢ Syrae's Nomenclature of Colours. t Nuove Observazione Microscopiche. Napoli, 177G.

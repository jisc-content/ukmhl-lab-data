502 GENERAL ANATOMY. seen by WolfiUvS,* Wynandts,f Cheselden,! Portal,^ Derame,|| Bichat,^ and Wardrop. Rupture of the muscular coat of the stomach, which is not unfrequent, is in like manner the consequence of ulceration or erosion of its villous membrane, and shall be noticed under that head. '7. Bony induration or deposition.—This, though not very frequent, is not unknown. Morgagni mentions in his first case of ulcerative rupture a bony mass an inch thick, shaped like a half ring, being found in the muscular substance of the left ventricle, adhering, however, to the mitral valves, also ossified. A similar case is recorded by Hal- ler; and to such instances it may be justly ob- jected, that they are not so much examples of conversion of muscular fibre into bone as deposi- tion of bony matter in collateral tissues progres- sively encroaching on the muscular layer. One of the most distinct examples of seeming conver- sion of muscular fibre into calcareous matter is given by Renaudin in the person of a man of 33, subject to violent palpitation. The substance of the left ventricle was infiltrated with sabu- lous and crystalline grains. This calcareous deposition must not be confounded with ossified pericardium,—the usual example of ossified heart. * Haller Bibl. Chir. I. p. 223. t Verhand. von Haarlem. X Anatomy, p. 207- § Anat.

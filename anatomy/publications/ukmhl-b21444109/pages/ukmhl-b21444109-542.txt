GENERAL ANATOMY. 520 scarcely known. Ossification in ligament com- mences at the point connected with the periosteum; and it is uncommon to observe it extend over the whole ligament, unless in cases of anchylosis and stiff joint, in which it is rather a sort of cartilagi- nous rigidity and induration than actual conver- sion into bone. The former appears to be the origin of the bony nodules or sesamoid bones oc- casionally found in the substance of the funicular ligaments. In the irregular ligaments, especially the sacro-ischiatic, it is not unusual to find ossifi- cation in aged subjects. That the periosteum may be converted into bone is a point which has been alternately admitted and denied during eighty years. While the numerous experiments of Du Ham el* and Trojat tend to establish it in the affirmative, it is rendered very doubtful by the facts and arguments of Leveille and Richerand. From the experiments of the for- mer authors it results that the periosteum becomes thick, highly vascular, very firm, and eventually acquires a bony hardness in its inner layer under either of the following circumstances:â€”1st, when it is detached from the bone; 2d, after fractures during the process of reunion ; and Sdli/, when the marrow or its membrane is destroyed. That in the two former instances the inner layers of the peri- osteum truly undergo conversion into bone, may be regarded as established, not only by the experi- * Mem. de I'Acad. des Sciences, 1741, &c. t Mem. de la Societe Roy. de Med. 1776. 3

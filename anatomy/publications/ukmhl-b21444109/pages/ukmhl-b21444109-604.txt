GENERAL ANATOMY. 580 structure of the epiphysis entirely disappears, and in its place is found a soft homogeneous reddish mass. The situation of the marrow is occupied by a red, thick, semifluid matter like clotted blood, mixed with grease or suet. The flat bones of the scull are generally equally soft, flesh-like, and sectile. The cancellated structure of the diploe is equally destroyed, and its place is occupied by a uniform soft reddish substance, from sections of which bloody servim exudes. The periosteum is sometimes thickened, but is often unchanged. The cause of this change is quite unknown. The most ingenious and probable conjecture re- garding it is that by Howship, who, from the ne- croscopic appearances of a well described case, in- fers that it is the effect of a morbid action of the capillary arteries upon the medullary membrane within the bone; and that the disappearance of the latter is the effect of absorption exercised by the morbid secretion. * 6. Friability. Fragility. In the disease now de- scribed the bones may be broken by the weight of the person, or slight action of the muscles; and perhaps most cases of spontaneous fracture are referable either to incipient osteo-sarcosis, to ne- crosis, or to spina ventosa. One instance of this I certainly traced to incipient necrosis. Others, perhaps, are more equivocal. Is the animal mat- ter absorbed ? 7. Interstitial absorption.â€”Under this name Mr * Case of Mollities ossmm, &c. Med.-Chirurg. Tr. Edin. Vol. ii. p. 136.

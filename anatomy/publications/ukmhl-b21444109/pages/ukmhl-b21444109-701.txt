MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 677 is identified with albuminous exudation. According to the investigation of its chemical properties by Schwilgue, Mau- noir and Peschier, and Jurine, it appears to contain albumen in various proportions, and to owe its tenacity and firmness to this principle. Bretonneau, in particular, endeavoured to establish a distinction between the tracheo-bronchial exu- dation, the albuminous concretions of serous membranes, and the buffy coat, bvit without success. * It may be inferred, therefore, that this substance, without being either wholly coagulable lymph, or thickened mucus, or dried purulent matter, is a morbid product secreted from the tracheo-bron- chial mucous surface, in a semifluid form, and undergoing, in consequence of the presence of albuminous or albumino- gelatinous matter, coagulation, as it is more freely exposed to air. Death is produced in this disease chiefly by the albumi- nous fluid in the bronchial tubes and vesicles excluding the air from the pulmonary membrane. Bronchiasis ulbuminosa adultorum. Polypose injlamma- tion of the trachea. Not very dissimilar is that morbid state of the tracheo-bronchial membrane, in which a membranous concretion, moulded on the tube, is, from time to time, brought up by coughing either in fragments or entire.

In many instances they are the result of a mo- dification of the inflammatory process.

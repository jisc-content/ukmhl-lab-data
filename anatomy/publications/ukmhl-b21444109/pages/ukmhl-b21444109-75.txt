ADIPOSE TISSUE. 55 which are said to consist again of an assemblage of vesicles still more minute, and agglomerated together by very fine and delicate cellular tissue. The appearance of these ultimate vesicles is mi- nutely described by Wolff in the subcutaneous fat, and by Monro and Clopton Havers in the marrow of bones, in which the two last authors compared them to strings of minute pearls. If the fat with which these vesicles are generally distended should disappear, as happens in dropsy, the vesicles collapse, their cavity is obliterated, and they are confounded with the contiguous cellular tissue, without leaving any trace of their existence. Hunter, however, asserts, that in such circum- stances the cellular tissue differs from the tissue of adipose vesicles, in containing no similar cavi- ties ; and justly remarks that the latter is much more fleshy and ligamentous than the filamentous tissue, and contends, that though the adipose re- ceptacles are empty and collapsed, they still â‚¬xist. When the skin is dissected from the adipose mem- brane it is always possible to distinguish the lat- ter from the filamentous tissue, even if it contain no fat, by the toughness of its fibres, and the coarseness of the web which they make. The distinguishing characters between the cel- lular or filamentous and the adipose tissue may be stated in the following manner. Isf, The vesicles of the adipose membrane ax"e closed all round, and, unlike the cellular tissue, they cannot be general- ly penetrated by fluids which are made to enter

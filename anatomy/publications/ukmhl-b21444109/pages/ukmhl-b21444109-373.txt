BRAIN. 351 The pyramidal bodies, situate on the anterior part of the medulla oblongata, and mutually se- parated by the median furrow, consist entirely of bands or rods of whitish fibres, (Die Mark Stab- chen,) extending longitudinally through them. Becoming thicker, but not less compact at the upper end, where they are connected with the part named bridge, (pons Varolii; der Brucke ;) or annular protuberance, (nodus cerebri;) these longitudinal fibres undergo a new arrangement. First, They are covered with a firm layer of transverse fibres, which proceed, as it were, from the middle line on each side circularly round. These fibres are white, firm transversely, and abundantly distinct. When peeled off to the depth of about 1^ line or two, the longitudinal fibres of the pyramids begin to appear; but no longer collected in mass as below. Nuiherous transverse or circular-transverse fibres are inter- posed between them, so as to separate them into layers. Hence results the complex structure of the bridge, which externally appears to consist of circular-transverse matter, but internally presents many longitudinal bands. It is worthy of notice, that in transverse and longitudinal sections the part which appears gray on the transverse section is white on the longitudinal, and conversely. The closeness with which the circular fibres are com- pacted render the bridge decidedly the firmest part of the whole brain. Proceeding from the lower to the upper sur-

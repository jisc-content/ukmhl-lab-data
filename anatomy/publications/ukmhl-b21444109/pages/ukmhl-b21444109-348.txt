GENERAL ANATOMY. 326 cognize any difference in the colour of this and other parts of the convoluted surface. I suspect, therefore, that Vicq-D'Azyr, who in noticing this part has called it the white iierforated substance, {substance blanche perforee), applied the term of colour without examining the contiguous parts, when denuded of their membranous investments. The same name nearly {lamina perforata) has been given it by Reil. The orifices which charac- terize this part of the brain admit, from the Syl- vian or middle artery, an infinity of blood-vessels, which here penetrate the part denominated the hook-shaped cerebral band (Der Haaken-formige Mark-biindel) delineated by Reil. This circum- stance renders the adjoining part the most vascu- lar of the whole organ,â€”a fact which will be shown to be important in the pathology of the brain. Anterior to the perforated spot at the extreme verge of the unconvoluted substance, is situate a small pointed eminence, of gray colour, shaped like a triangular pyramid, most conspicuous when cleared of the membrane which covers it. Pro- ceeding backward from this, we remark two slen- der white lines of different lengths, and following different directions. The inner of these is short; and after a course seldom exceeding four or five lines in the adult brain suddenly ceases to be visi- ble. The outer one is much longer, follows a curved direction, with the concave part of its course directed anteriorly, and is of a more vivid

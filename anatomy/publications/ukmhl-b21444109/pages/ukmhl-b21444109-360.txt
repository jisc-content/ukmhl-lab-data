338 GENERAL ANATOMY. seem to have examined this part of the organ, the vague and unprecise terms in which they speak of it, as if its existence were apocryphal,â€”show the necessity of more correct researches. Soem- mering and Gordon describe in this situation two eminences, termed the outer and inner geniculate bodies. The description of the former author is brief and precise, but not quite so satisfactory as could be wished. That of the latter is more minute; but in some respects it is either not clear, or it does not apply generally. On this point, however, I speak with the deference which I feel to the memory of a diligent anatomist. The confusion and uncertainty which prevails on this piece of cerebral anatomy induced me to adopt a method which' I find to be more certain in unfolding the objects in question, and which may be safely recommended to the practical ana- tomist. Let the brain be examined from below, and let the examination commence with the optic tracts. That the acceptation of this term may be definite, I observe that the optic nerves should be in accuracy counted from the commissure only. The cerebral extremity or origin, as it is named, of a nerve, should be reckoned from that point only at which it is quite free in its whole circum- ference from the organ. This happens to the op- tic nerves at the anterior part of the commissure only ; for behind this body the longitudinal bands called tracts adhere by one side (the outer) to the cerebral substance.

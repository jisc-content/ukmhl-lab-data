The third case, that of injury of the marrow and its vessels, is perhaps more ambiguous. It appears, never- theless, from the experiments of M. Cruveilhier, that only when the medullary membrane is de- stroyed, with the permanent continuance of a fo- reign body in the canal, ossification at the sur- face of the bone takes place at the expence not only of the periosteum, but even of the muscles. The condition necessary for the ossification of the periosteum after injury appears to be that the con- comitant inflammation produces albuminous effu- sion only; for when the membrane is in contact with purulent matter, effusion of albuminous or co- agulable fluid is precluded ; and in this sense only, perhaps, are the inferences of Le veille to be admitted. In fascia, I have said, and I may add tendinous aponeurosis, ossification is almost unknown. To this head, however, may perhaps be referred the instance recorded by Hoernigk of alleged ossifica- tion of the tendinous centre of the diaphragm and part of the intercostal muscles ยง ; that of chondro- osteoid induration of the right half of the dia- phragm by Lieutaud from the Petersburg!!

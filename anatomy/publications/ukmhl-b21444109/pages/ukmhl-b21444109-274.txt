GENERAL ANATOMY. 252 be penetrated with deposition of calcareous matter. The diseased action commences at one or more points, and is progressively extended, till the gland is converted into a bony mass. * This change was observed by Cruickshank in the tra- cheo-bronchial glands, which he represents as in that state producing ulceration through the trachea, and being coughed up as osseous con- cretions, f Baillie, adopting the same view, re- gards the calcareous deposition as more common in these bodies than in any other of the same tex- ture. I Lastly, Rayer has observed this change not only in the tracheo-bronchial glands in sub- jects which he terms phthisical, but in the cervi- cal glands, in laryngeal consumption, and occa- sionally in persons cut off by mesenteric scrofula, (carreau,) and in the inguinal glands in persons who have had buboes. This change he considers the effect of inflammation. || To the same head are to be referred the earthy or calcareous deposi- tions {matiere platreuse, gypseuse) observed by Dupuy in these glands. The tubercular disorganization is represented by Laennec, Dupuy, and others, as exceedingly frequent in lymphatic glands. By some authors these bodies are regarded as constituting the ana- * A Practical Essay on the Diseases of the Vessels and Glands of the Absorbent System, &c. By William Goodlad, Surgeon, &c. p. 74.

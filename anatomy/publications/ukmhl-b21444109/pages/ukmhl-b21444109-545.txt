WHITE FIBROUS SYSTEM. 523 cancer (scirrho-carcinoma) ever originate in the periosteum ? The tumours to which this name has been applied are rather examples of osteo- sarcoma than of genuine scirrhus. Such at least is the character of most of the tumours of the maxillary sinus. 6. When the encephaloid degeneration (fungus hcBmatodes) appears in the periosteum, it may often be traced to the contiguous muscles, or to some of the adjoining articular tissues, or to the bone itself. In the latter case, however, it is almost impossible to determine whether the bone or periosteum were the original seat of the disease. 7. Punctured and contused wounds of the white fibrous system, especially of the ligaments and periosteum, are liable to be succeeded by tetanic motions, more or less general; and wounds with much laceration in subjects of all ages are too often followed by gangrenous inflammation ter- minating fatally. This I have seen several times, not only in compound dislocations of the larger joints, but in contused wounds of the feet, in which the white fibrous system is much injured. Partial laceration of the capsular ligaments occa- sionally takes place in dislocation. (A. Bonn, Desault, Howship, Sir A. Cooper.) 8. Desmectasis. Excessive relaxation is men- tioned as an anormal state occurring in ligaments. It is the result of repeated overdistension, as in luxation or subluxation, or in consequence of the weakness sometimes left after local inflammation, or long-continued disease. Though this may hap-

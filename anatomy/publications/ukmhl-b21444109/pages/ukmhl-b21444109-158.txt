GENERAL ANATOMY. 136 matter of strict observation, rests ou very hypo- thetical grounds. Of the different kinds of terminations assigned to arteries, and of origins assigned to veins, one only admits of sensible and satisfactory demon- stration. Arteries, when they have so much di- minished as to become capillary, are seen by the microscope, in some instances by the naked eye, to pass directly into corresponding capillary veins, or to end abruptly in some organ or membrane unconnected with any other vessel. * It is like- wise certain that the microscope shows eveiy ca- pillary vein to arise from a capillary artery ; and if there be any other mode of origin, it has not yet been demonstrated or established, f Only one other circumstance requires to be taken into ac- count in this inquiry. This is, that the capillary artery and vein may contain either red or colour- less blood ; for, according to the size of the vessels, and the nature of the organs or tissues in which they are distributed, the blood which flows tlirough them will be coloured or colourless. This view of the communication of minute arteries and veins, which is perfectly consistent with the known facts, will afford the only explanation which it is possible to give, of the singular division of the capillary system which Bichat has chosen. This author has considered the capillary system under three general heads. 1*/, In organs in which it contains blood only; for instance, in the mus- â€¢ Gordon, p. 56. t lb. p. 62.

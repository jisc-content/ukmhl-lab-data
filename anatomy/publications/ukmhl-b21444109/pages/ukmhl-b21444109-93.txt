AKTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 73 without fibres or other obvious traces of organiza- tion. This membrane is supposed to be prolonged to form those minute vessels in which the proper coat cannot be traced. It is very brittle, and is distinguished during life by a remarkable activity in forming the morbid states to which arteries are liable. In other respects it is deemed by Bichat peculiar, and, though similar to the proper mem- brane, is to be considered as unlike any other tis- sue. Its chemical composition is not known. 2. Exterior to this common or inner membrane is placed a dense strong tissue of considerable thickness, of a dun yellowish colour, which is found to consist of fibres disposed in concentric circles placed contiguous to each other round the axis of the artery. If this substance be examined either from without or in the opposite direction, it wiU be found that, by proper use of forceps, its fibres can be separated to an indefinite degree of minuteness, even to that of a hair, and that they uniformly separate in the same direction. Longi- tudinal fibres are visible neither in this nor in any other tissue of the arterial tube. This is the proper arterial tissue, (tunica -propria.) Its uni- form dun yellow colour is perceived through the semitransparent inner membrane, and is most con- spicuous either when this is removed, or when the outer cellular envelope is detached and the component threads separated from each other; and if it be less distinct in the smaller branches, it is because thÂ« tissue on which the colour depends is

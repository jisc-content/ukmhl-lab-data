204 GENEUAI. ANATOMY. various diseases of tlie rif^lit auricle and right ven- tricle of the heart; hard disorganization or tu- bercles of the liver; hepatization or tubercular dis- organization of the limgs; hard disorganization or scirrhus of the pancreas and spleen ; and compres- sion of the ascending cava by the gravid womb during the latter stage of pregnancy. Of a more local character are the tjedematous swellings which appear in the neighbovirhood of tumours and ab- scesses. Thus in abscess, aneurism, or tumour of the arm-pit, and in scirrhus or cancer of the female breast, the whole arm becomes oedematous from the top of the shoulder to the tip of the fingers. One of the earliest symptoms of lumbar abscess is in some instances an oedematous enlargement of the leg of the side on which the abscess takes j)lcU'e ; and al- most all deep-seated collections of matter give rise to considerable oedema of the superior cellular membrane and skin. The operation of the several circumstances now mentioned, though well miderstood by many pa- thologists, has been happily illustrated by Bouillaud, who has shown that in many instances tumours in the neighbourhood of venous trunks compress them so much as to produce obliteration of their canal. The interior of the vessel is then occupied with a clot of blood, sohd, fibrinous, and more^ or less friable, manifestly produced by the blood being stopped in its course along the vein. * â€¢ De 1'obliteration cles veines et de son influence sur la formation dcs hydropisies partielles, Par M.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 460 M. Bouillaud adduces various facts and argu- ments to show that they are the result or product of an inflammatory process ; and if the idea at- tached to this term be sufficiently comprehensive, the opinion may not be remote from the truth. The tendency of this process is to produce albumi- nous secretions or depositions in various forms; and it is not improbable, that, under certain cir- cumstances, it may be so modified as cause the de- position of this substance in an indivisable mass, in a limited sitviation, and from a proper cyst.* Whatever be the origin of these bodies, it is under- stood, that, sooner or later, they undergo a change in their interior, which sometimes at the centre, sometimes in several points, simultaneously be- gins to soften and become fluid. It is at least known that such bodies are found to have fluid or semifluid contents, consisting chiefly of serous liquor with albuminous flakes or curd-like masses in it. Of this description are the tumour of the protuberance represented by Dr Yelloly as in a state of imperfect suppuration; f the cerebral vomiccB described by Coindet as similar to tumours of mehceris; the seventy-fifth case of Dr Aber- crombie; that in the protuberance given by DrKel- lie, (Monro,p. 178,) and byDr MoncriefFin the same work, (pp. 50â€”53.) When the softening or lique- fying process is complete, the tubercular mass as- sumes the form of an encysted abscess.

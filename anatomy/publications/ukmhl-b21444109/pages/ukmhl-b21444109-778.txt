754 GENERAL ANATOMY. smooth, the other somewhat floceulent, and the substance of which appears with and without a glass to be traversed by numerous minute vessels. The transparent web, which forms the basis or ground-work of this membrane, possesses the characters of very close filamentous tissue ; and it may be regarded as a filamento-vascular web. Its smooth surface, which is also the free one, is manifestly a continuation of the arachnoid mem- brane. Like that it is smooth, polished, thin as the finest silver paper, and it may be raised from the more filamento-vascular basis of the mem- brane to which it adheres. I am now, by describing the characters and dis- tribution of this membrane, to show how far it resembles, and how far it is unlike, the perfect se- rous membrane. The fine inner lamina from which the cerebral surface of the dura mater derives its glistening aspect, I have already stated, is to be regarded as the outer or cranial division of the arachnoid mem- brane. This is to be proved, first, by its anato- mical characters, and, secondly, by its distribution and transit. The inner or free surface of the dura mater presents, it has been already said, all the charac- ters of the free surface of the pia mater, except one,â€”the facility with which the thin pellicle, which gives it these characters, can be detached. This, however, is derived from the want of fila- mentous tissue intermediate between the fibrous

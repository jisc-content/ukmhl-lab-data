536 GENERAL ANATOMY. The veins of bones are peculiar in their ar- rangement. The nutritious artery is accompa- nied by a social vein; the articular and periosteal vessels are said to be destitute of corresponding venous vessels. According to Dupuytren, how- ever, minute venous capillaries arise from the substance of the osseous tissue, precisely as in other tissues, and, uniting in the same manner, form twigs, branches, and trunks, which finally terminate in the neighbouring veins. Lymphatics are not found in the substance of bones. Bichat, however, thinks analogically, that nutrition implies exhalation and absorption ; but it is manifest that this does not demonstrate the existence of true lymphatics. Nerves in like man- ner have not been traced into this substance.* To complete the anatomical history of bone, it is requisite to examine shortly the marrow. The interior of the long bones contains a notable quan- tity of fat, oleaginous matter, which has been long known under the name of marrow ([jjvskog osiTfig, medulla;) and a similar substance, though in much smaller quantity, is found in the loose cancellated tissue of the flat and short bones. It is in the first situation only that it is possible to examine the anatomical characters of this sub- stance. It is sufficiently similar to fat or animal oil in other parts of the body to lead us to refer it at present to that head. In other respects, its * On these points see Scarpa, de Anatome el Patkologia Ossium Comment, p. 38, &c.; and Howship, Med. Chir. Tr, Vol. viii. p. 60.

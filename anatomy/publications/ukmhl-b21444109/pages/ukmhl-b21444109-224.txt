f 202 GENERAI, ANATOAiV. The conditions of the capillary system in which exhalation is preternaturally augmented are re- ferable to two general heads. The first of these is the state of distension which takes place during inflammation, fever, &c. The second is the dis- tension which results from any mechanical impe- diment to the free motion of the blood in a venous trunk or trunks, or in the arteries. a. That the distended or overloaded state of the capillaries which occurs during inflammation may cause a great and disproportionate increase in the fluid exhaled, is established by the phenomena of inflammation of the filamentovis tissue, and especial- ly of the serous membranes. In the former, oedema and anasarca are results by no means unfrequent. In the latter, one of the first effects of inflannna- tion, imder certain circumstances, is effiision of fluid more or less copious, and containing various proportions of coagulable matter. If the propor- tion of the latter be great, its coagulation forms organizable lymph, which is the medium of adhe- sion, while the serous part disappears, apparently by absorption. If it be small, its coagulation gives rise to mere loose flakes, which, with the constant increase of the quantity of fluid effused, are unable to maintain their attachment to any part of the membrane ; while the thin serous j)art is so copious, that, as it is not removed by the veins and lymphatics, it remains in the form of a serous, a sero-sanguine, or a sero-jnirulent fluid, consti- tuting genuine dropsy.

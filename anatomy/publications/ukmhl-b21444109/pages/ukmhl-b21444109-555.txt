BONE. 533 was found in the experiments of Hatchett, was shown by Berzelius to be formed during calcination. It is, however, pretty obvious that a little more than a third part of bone consists of animal mat- ter, which appears to be either entirely gelatine, or a modification of that principle; and that the re- mainder, nearly equal to two-thirds, consists of earthy matter, which is chiefly phosphoric acid combined with lime. Is the carbonic acid said to be united with lime also not a result of the de- composition of the animal matter? The other saline substances are not peculiar to bone, but, being common to it and the other animal tissues, and even the fluids, may be supposed, without much injustice, to be derived from the blood left in the bone at the moment of death. It is most difficult to say what is the nature of the animal matter of bones. At one time it was presumed to be cartilage; but this appears to be a mere assumption, derived from the superficial resemblance which it bears to this substance. It does not appear to be mere gelatine; for though this principle is obtained from bone in quantity, and bones are economically used in manufacturing glue, they do not furnish the same proportion of jelly as tendon, nor are they so useful in making soups, as was once paradoxically and absurdly enough maintained by some chemists. It is pro- bable that the gelatine, as we have already stated, is under a peculiar modification, or combined with some principle which is not well understood. Is

The channels or openings through which they are expelled, which are temporary deficien- cies in the new bone, are termed cloacce. % The above is a brief description of the process of necrosis with regeneration as it occurs in the cylindrical bones. Its effects were known long before its mechanism was understood. The fact of one bone being found within another was re- marked by Duverney, Ruysch, \ a Mekren, Chesel- den, and others of the older anatomists and sur- geons ; and even Portal speaks of the circum- stance of one bone rattling within another as a curi- ous and unexplained phenomenon.|| Amyand, Mac- kenzie, Hunter, Ludwig, Bromfield, Laing, and others, describe the disease with the process of re- generation under various names, as spina vento- sa, detachment of the epiphyses, caries, loss of a bone, or reproduction, according as any one part of the process was most prominent, without ap- pearing to be aware of its true nature.

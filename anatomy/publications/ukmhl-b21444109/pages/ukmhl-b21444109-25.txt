In these delicate and difficult inqui- ries, the observations of Malpighi are in gene- ral faithful to nature, and his descri})tions accu- rate. The information which he collected was new and curious, and it is communicated in per- spicuous language, and in an interesting manner. He may be justly regarded as the founder of that part of anatomical science which treats of struc- ture and organization ; and even in the present day his writings on this subject are by no means destitute either of interest or instruction. About the same time the researches of De I641. Graaf and Ruysch tended to throw some light on the intimate structure of several organs. De Graaf, who was young, while Malpighi was de- clining in years, studied particularly the structure 16C4. of the pancreas, and of the organs of generation ices, in both sexes, and at once removed many popular errors, and communicated a large proportion of accurate information. Had he not been cut off at the early age of thirty-two, it cannot be doubted 1073. that his zeal in prosecuting the true knowledge of minute structure would have greatly advanced this department of anatomy. Frederic Ruysch, professor of anatomy and ig30. surgery at Amsterdam, was more fortunate. As- siduously devoted, during a long life, to the cul-

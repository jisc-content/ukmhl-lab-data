ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 109 of producing ulceration of the middle coat, and laceration succeeded by hemorrhage more or less violent, according to the size of the vessel. This process, which depends on the destruction of the nutrient vessels (vasa vasorum) transmitted in the filamentous coat, may succeed any injuiy in- flicted on the neighbouring parts, as contused wounds, burns, phagedenic sores, especially those in lymphatic glands, the application of improper ligatures, especially broad tapes, and the use of foreign bodies as pads, presse-arteres and serve- arteres in the neighbourhood of an artery. Re- moval of the filamentous sheath, partly or entire- ly, is not unfrequently followed with the same eflfect. This, however, must be understood to apply chiefly to the human subject. In the lower animals the filamentous sheath may be removed without injuring the proper and inner membrane. (Hunter and Home.) * This shows that in these circumstances its inflammation is not attended with the bad effects which result in the human subject. Arteries may be involved in the diseases of muscles, bones, and other jjarts, and in the pro- gressive invasion of foreign or new productions. * Transactions of a Society for improving Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge, Vol. I. p. 144.

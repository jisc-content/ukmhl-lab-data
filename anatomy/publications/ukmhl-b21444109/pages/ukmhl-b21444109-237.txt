215 SYSTEM or EXHALANTS. an isolated animal existence, their connection with increased exhalation of serous membranes, their structure and intimate arrangement, and their contents, are circumstances more in favour of the opinion that they are pellucid serous cysts newly developed. By Plenck the hydatid is regarded as a variety of the next speciesâ€”the hygroma. Combined with atheromatous or steatomatous matter, hydatid-cysts are occasionally found in the subcutaneous cellular tissue. (Heunden apud Ty- son, sixty hydatids in a cyst in the neck.) |3. Hygroma. Cysts secreting serovis, sero- purulent, or even a sero-sanguine fluid. This epithet Plenck applies to a spherical tumour con- taining coagulable lymph, evidently meaning fluid; and regards it as differing from the hydatid in size only, and from lymphatic (serous) tumours, by the possession of a membranous covering, or proper cyst. 'It is more expedient to apply it to all encysted tumours not manifestly hydatoid, which contain serous, sero-purulent, or viscid glairy fluid, or even reddish senun, in whatever situation they are found. The best example of this tumour is the cyst or cysts often found in the female ovary, in which they vary in size, and in the colour and consistence of their contents, from mere serum, with more or less albumen, to reddish, bloody, or even tar-like fluid. They occur in the brain, e. g. its hemisphere, * and in the pineal gland. The * The Morbid Anatomy of the Human Brain. By Ro- bert Hooper, M. D. Plates XIII. XII. Fig. 8. and XIV.

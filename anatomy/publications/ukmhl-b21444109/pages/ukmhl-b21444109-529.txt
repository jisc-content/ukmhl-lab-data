507 TENDON. tendon and aponeurosis. The dura mater, the tunica albuginea, and the fibro-synovial sheaths, are to be regarded as compound membranes. Ligament and periosteum are easily shown to consist of strong whitish or gray fibres, as minute - as threads or hairs, interwoven together in various directions, and thus forming an animal substance which is not to be split or torn asunder as ten- don ; but when ruptured by extreme force pre- sents an irregular ragged surface or margin. Maceration in water or alkaline fluids separates the component fibres, and shows their irregular disposition more distinctly. They are crisped by affusion of boiling water, or immersion in acids ; and they become translucent by immersion in oil of turpentine. The properties of this tissue are chiefly physi- cal. Those which are vital are referable to its organization and nutrition. It is powerfully re- sisting, and is one of the toughest and strongest tissues in the animal body, as is shown by the numerous experiments recorded in the writings of the iatro-raathematical physiologists. It is supposed to possess the exhaling ends of arteries and colourless veins. No nerves have been re- cognized ; and Bichat expresses his ignorance of absorbents being traced into it. Ligament when boiled yields a small portion of gelatine, but obstinately resists the action of boil- ing water, and retains both its shape and tenacity or cohesion. The crispation which it undergoes in boiling water, alcohol, and diluted acids, seems

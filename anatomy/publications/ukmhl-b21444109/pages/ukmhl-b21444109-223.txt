SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 201 ries. While the process of exhalation is admitted and believed, we must avow, as Cruickshank did long ago, that we are unable to prove satisfac- torily the existence of any set of vessels, or any mechanism by which it might be accomplished. This difficulty, however, need not prevent us from observing, that this is the proper place for noticing those morbid changes which are referred to the process of exhalation. Section II. The exhalations, properly so called, may be mor- bidly augmented or diminished, or quite changed. 1. The best examples of morbid increase of ex- halation is conceived to be found in those of the serous membranes, giving rise to the disease term- ed dropsy. (Hydrops.) It is most frequent in the jeritoneum and in the general cellular membrane; ess so in the pleura and pericardium, and in the arachnoid membrane or its divisions. In a local form it is very frequent in the vaginal coatof thetes- ticle. Recent observations on this morbid change, and on the state of the system when under its in- fluence, would lead to the conclusion, that it is rarely a primary process, but is generally to be considered as the effect of another,â€”as the symp- tom of a peculiar condition of the system of capil- lary arteries going to the tissue which is the im- mediate seat of exhalation.

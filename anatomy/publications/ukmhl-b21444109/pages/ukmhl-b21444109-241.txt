According to this pathologist, the tumour may originate in slight adhesive inflammation of any definite jjor- tion of cellular tissue, in consequence of which one cell, being obstructed and prevented from communicating with others, is progressively dis- tended by deposition of matter, which, pressing on the surrounding tissue, gradually condenses it in- to a membrane as it extends. To this idea ob- jections have been already stated from Bichat; and it must be admitted that facts are still want- ing to explain this otherwise than by saying, that the cyst is formed, and secretes its proper con- tents. ^ Steatoma.

SYSTEM OF CAPILLAllY VESSELS, &C. 169 it is requisite merely to consider the phenomena of fever in the living body, and its traces and ef- fects in the dead. a, I presume that the affection of the capillary system of the brain, both cranial and vertebral, is too generally admitted to require being formally demonstrated. In point of fact, the pain of the head in the beginning of all fevers, the derange- ment of thought during their progress, and the tendency to stupor and absolute coma towards the conclusion, are sufficient alone to prove disorder of the cerebral capillaries. But when blood or se- rous fluid is found effused into the ventricles, when the vessels of the brain are found turgid, distend- ed with blood, and more numerous than natural, it is impossible to resist the inference as to the overloaded state of the cerebral capillaries during life. I am aware that cases of fever ai'e sometimes adduced in which neither pain of the head nor deranged thought are observed. I can only say, that among a very great number of cases which I have observed, though in a few the patient did not complain of headach, it was always possible to recognize more or less derangement of thought. In all cases pain is felt when the patient coughs or stoops, or when the head is slightly shaken ; and when no pain is said to be felt, it indicates that the stage of natural sensation is passed, and that he complains not, because he does not feel. In ague the oppression of the cerebral capilla- ries may be so great as to constitute inflammation

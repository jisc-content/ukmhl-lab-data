GENERAL ANATOMY. 272 Sue, and Harless, * and afterwards applied with so much ingenuity by Bichat, that the ganglions are so many nervous centi'es or minute brains, is disproved by strict anatomical observation. 2d, That they are connected with the order of in- voluntary actions, and influence these actions, is a gratuitous hypothesis, and may be true or false, without being necessarily the case. 3d, Lastly, we remark, as a circumstance of some importance, that the only difference between a ganglion, and any other part of a nervous chord, is, that in the former the minute nervous filaments appear to be uncovered with neurilema, and lodged in a mass of cellular tissue, which is then inclosed in the neurilematic capsule; while in the latter each nervous filament has its appropriate neurilema, and the cellular tissue, instead of being within, is on its exterior, and connects it to the contiguous filaments. In various situations two, three, or more ner- vous trunks or chords mutually unite by means of some of their component threads, and after proceeding in this manner for a short space, again separate, but not in the same number of original trunks, or preserving the same appearance. In general, the number of chords into which they finally separate is greater than that of which they consisted before union. Three or four nervous * J. J. Sue, Recherches PhysiologiqueSj &c.

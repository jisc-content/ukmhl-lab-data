The tracheo-bronchial glands become enlarged in in- flammation of the bronchial membrane, of the pul- monic tissue, and other diseases of the lungs ; and those of the mesentery increase in consequence of disease of the intestinal canal. In such instances it is obvious that irritation at the organic end of the lymphatics is the cause of morbid action in the glands, at the glandular end of these vessels. In other instances, for example, when a sore on the penis is followed by enlargement of the in- guinal glands, or a cancerous breast is attended with swelling and pain of the axillary glands, it has been concluded, that, as the primaiy diseases depend on a peculiar or specific action, as it was termed, peculiar matter is absorbed, and con- veyed to the gland, in which it gives rise to the morbid changes. We now know that it is unne- cessary, in the majority of cases, to suppose ab- sorption, which indeed is rendered very doubtful; and it is sufficient to ascribe the glandular enlarge- ment in such instances to mere irritation at the or- ganic ends of the lymphatics. 2. Enlargement from the Operation of Poison^ ous Matter. Pestilential Buho. In plague the glands of the arm-pit and of the groin generally be- come enlarged as the disease advances. The period at which this takes place is uncertain, but seems to vary from the first twenty-four hours to the se- venth or eighth day. (Russel, de Mertens, Orraeus, &c.) This enlargement, which soon proceeds to a bad open sore, accompanied with sloughing and

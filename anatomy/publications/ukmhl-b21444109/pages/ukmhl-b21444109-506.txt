484 GENERAL ANATOMY. 2. According to the observations of M. Serres * and MM. Foville and Pinel Grandcharnp, when the corpus striatum, that is, the anterior part of the striated nucleus, is injured, the motions of the legs are disordered and impaired; and when the optic thalamus^ or the postei'ior region of the striat- ed nucleus, is injured, the motions of the arms are impaired. 3. Though M. Serres has endeavoured to de- monstrate the position of M. Gall, that lesions of the middle lobe of the cerebellum have a particu- lar influence on the generative organs, this is ren- dered very doubtful by the researches of Rolando, Flourens, and especially Bouillaud. M. Flourens endeavours to show that the cerebellum regulates, influences, or co-ordinates the voluntary motions. BouiUaud shows that, though it cannot be said to regulate the Avhole of these motions, it co-ordinates those concerned in equilibrium, the state of rest, and the different forms of locomotion. It seems further to be the seat of a modification of memory, that of voluntary motion. When disordered, the memory is obliterated, the motions are impaired or disordered, and the patient exhibits all the pheno- mena of imbecility, in vrilling any regular or steady motion, or in preserving any sensible attitude of rest.f * Annuaire Medico-Chirurgical et Journal de Physiolo- gic, Tome iii. p. 123â€”128, et ensuite. f Recherches Experimentales, &c. par J.

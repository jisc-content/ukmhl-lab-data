Scarpa, especially in his recent work, main- tains that S2nna ventosa differs in degree only from exostosis and osteosarcoma. * The opinion of Bichat is not very distinct, f That of Mon- teggia and Palletta X is much more explicit. The former represents it as commencing in the mar- row, which inflames slowly, swells and wastes, or passes into a slow suppuration, distending the pa- ri etes of the bone all round, and then bursting its compact shell, giving vent to the medullary sanies, and causing the inflammation and suppuration of the soft parts, at the bottom of which the bone is found bare and carious, or covered with fungous granulations, but with one or more orifices pene- trating into the medullary cavity. || This view errs only in placing the disease in the marrow, which as an inorganic secretion is incapable of orgasm, healthy or morbid. The true agent of the process is the vascular medullary web, especially of the epiphyses, of such bones as the vertebrae, the carpal and tarsal bones, and the phalanges. The cancellated arrangement of the osseous matter and of its medullary web in these bones explains the progress and phenomena of the disorder. That this is the seat of its action is to be inferred first from the phenomena of the * De Anatome et Pathologia Ossium, p. 76 and 78. \ Anatomie Generale, Tome iii. p. 112 X Exercitaliones Patholog.

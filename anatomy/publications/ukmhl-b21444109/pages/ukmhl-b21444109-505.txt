483 BRAIN. their influence seems to be referable chiefly to the morbid changes in the capillary circulation now mentioned. In many instances no change in sen- sation, intellect, or locomotion is induced till with- in a few days before death, when the convulsions, palsy, and coma, which preceded this event, must be ascribed chiefly to vascular injection taking place a little before these external effects became manifest. S. The situation of the morbid substance and of the disordered action is certainly of some mo- ment in modifying the effects produced. To de- termine the influence of local situation in this re- spect, attempts, direct and indirect, have been made by La Peyronie, Zinn, Lorry, Haller, and Sauce- rotte, and more recently by Rolando, Flourens, Serres, Bouillaud, and others. Without attempt- ing to inquire into the merit of the experimental and argumentative investigations of these authors, I shall merely state some of the most important conclusions which they have thought their re- searches justified. 1. Injury done to the anterior lobes of the brain causes, according to M. Bouillaud, more or less loss of speech, depending either on disorder or abo- lition of memory, or on that of the muscular mo- tions of the organs of speech.* * Recherches Cliniques, &c. par M. J.

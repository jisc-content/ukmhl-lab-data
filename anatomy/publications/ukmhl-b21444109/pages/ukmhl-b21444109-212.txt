Sir Everard Home, with the assistance of the microscopic inspection of M. Bauer, has made many observations on the structure of this organ. But his purpose appears to have been more parti- cularly directed to ascertain the phenomena of its function and uses ; and I cannot discover that his ideas on its intimate structure, and the arrange- ment of its capillary system, are very precise or distinct. The most distinct examples, in short, of erec- tile tissvie are to be found, according to Beclard, in the spongy texture which surroimds the Jire- tlira, in the cavernous body of the clitoris, the vascular structure of the nymplice, and in the nipple of the female. The structure of the lips in both sexes is not unlike. The veins of these parts may be shown to be well-marked and large- ly dilated at their origin, so as to give the appear- ance of cellular net-work. The same disposition is observed in the pulp of the fingers. It has been attempted to explain the motions of the iris

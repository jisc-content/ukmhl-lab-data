GENERAL ANATOMY. 224 loured tubes, then first named lacteals, issuing from the intestines of the dog, observed also a cluster of vessels less opaque near the portal emi- nences of the liver,â€”an observation which he af- terwards repeated in the horse and other quadru- peds. The same vessels were also described and delineated by Highmore. Passing over the uncertain and obscure hints given by Walaeus and Van Horne, the first ex- act information after Asellius is that which re- lates to Olaus Rudbeck, who, in 1650, is said to have seen them in a calf, and to have demonstrat- ed the thoracic duct, and the dilated sac, after- wards termed receptaculum chyli. Glisson informs us that JolyfFe had, in 1652, iinparted to him the knowledge of a set of vessels different from arteries and veins ; and it appears from the testimony of Wharton, that JolyfFe had demonstrated these vessels in 1650. * In short, the discovery of lymphatics, and the correction of some errors of Asellius, is ascribed to the English anatomist, not only by Wharton and Glisson, but by Charleton, Plott, Wotton, and Boyle. The existence of these vessels, thus partially de- monstrated, was afterwards more fully established by the researches of Bartholin, Pecquet, Bilsius, Nuck, the second Monro, and Haller. It is chiefly to the exertions of William Hunter, and * Francisci Glissonii Anatomia Hepatis, Cap. xxxi. Thorns Wharton, Adenographia, Cap. ii. p. 98.

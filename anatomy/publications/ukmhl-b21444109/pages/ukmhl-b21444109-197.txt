SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 175 matter, so frequent in fatal cases of remittent or yellow fever. In the latter it forms the dark, tarry, or treacle-like stools mentioned by practical authors in the same disease. (Jackson, Hunter, Physic, Cathrall, Bancroft, &c.) The description now given is general, and ap- plies to this capillary disorganization, as it takes place both in bad agues and remittents, and in yellow fever. In the former it is less frequent, but nevertheless takes place sufficiently often. In the latter it is seen in its most exquisite form, and is almost invariable in fatal cases. Its origin and formation have been traced in the most satis- factory manner by repeated dissections. The idea of black vomit being morbid or vitiated bile deserves no attention. In some instances of severe yellow fever a dark-coloured fluid of the same physical characters as those found in the in- testinal tube, may be traced coming down the biliary and hepatic duct from the j)ori hiliarii. This, however, instead of being bile, is blood which has oozed from the hepatic capillaries in the same manner as that from the intestinal ones. h. The capillaries of the urinary system are much affected during fever. Both in intermittents and in continued fevers bloody urine has been dis- charged. 6. In the same manner the capillaries of the mus- cles, of the filamentous tissue, and of the skin are morbidly distended. One of the most common

57 ADIPOSE TISSUE. hand, soles of the feet, pulp of the fiijgers and toes, flexures of the joints, round the kidney, beneath the cardiac serous membrane, and between the layers of the mesentery and omentum. In the more cor- pulent, and chiefly in females, it is found not mere- ly in these situations, but extended in a layer of some thickness almost uniformly over the whole person ; but is very abundant in the neck, breasts, belly, mons veneris, and flexures of the joints. Besides the delicate cellular tissue by which the packets and vesicles are united, the adipose tissue receives arterial and venous branches, the arrange- ment of which has been described by various au- thors from Malpighi, who gave the first accurate account, * to Mascagni, to whom we are indebted for the most recent. According to the latter, who * Malpighi's description is not much less accurate than that of Mascagni. " Vasa sanguines expanduntur in ramos ar- borum adinstar, quorum extremitatibus appenduntur mem- branosi sacculi, seu lobuli, pinguedinosis globulis referti, qui veluti folia ramis adnata arboris exactam figuram complent."— " Per has membranas excurrunt minima vasa in modum retis expansa, quae tenue omentum representant. Ha?c a venis et arteriis, ut videre potui, ortum ducunt, et non tantum leviter exterius pinguedinis lobulos, sed etiam intime penetrant, et pinguedinosis globulis nectuntur."—" Quandoque autem co- operiuntur levi superextensa membrana ita ut in conspectum non erumpant; emergunt autem quotiescunque vetustate et carie membranosae portiones corrumpuntur. Per hanc ean- dem membranam diramificantur adiposa vasa in omento re- perta, quae pinguedine turgent, si praecipue in de recenti mac- tato animali inspiciantur."—De Omento, Pinguedine et Adi- posis Ductibus, p. 41.

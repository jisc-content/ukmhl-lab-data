BRAIN. 371 blood are well known. It is highly vascular throughout. These vessels, first divided in the productions of the pia mater, are afterwards sub- divided to an incredible degree of minuteness, in the substance of the organ. They never anas- tomose. (Home.) They are accompanied with very minute veins, provided, it is said, with valves. Of these the most delicate branches are found, according to Sir Everard Home, in the gray convoluted matter, contrary to the state- ments of Ruysch, Albinus, and others; and con- versely in the white matter they are much larger.* The substance of brain has been examined by several chemists ; but the analysis most to be trusted is perhaps that of Vauquelin, who found that 100 parts of cerebral substance consist of 80 of water, 7 of albumen, 4.43 of a white adiÂ« pose matter, 0.70 of a red adipose matter, 1.12 of osmazome, 1.5 of phosphorus, and 5.15 of acids, salts, and sulphur. Upon the presence of the al- buminous matter depends the solidification which the brain undergoes when immersed in alcohol, acids, or solutions of the metallic salts, which coa- gulate that substance. Upon the presence of the white adipose matter depends the formation of those brilliant white crystalline plates, resembling cholesterine, observed by M. Gmelin in the brains preserved in the anatomical cabinet of Heidel- berg.f The opinion of this physician, that it pre- * Philosophical Transactions, Lend. 1821, pp. 29 and 30- f Zeitscrift fiir Physiologie, Von Tiedemann, Treviranus, und L.

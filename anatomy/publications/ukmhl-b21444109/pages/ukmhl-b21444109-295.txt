NERVOUS TISSUE. 273 trunks, for example, after uniting in this manner, will form on their final separation five or six nerves or nervous chords ; and it is quite impos- sible to determine which of the latter order was derived from any one or two of the former, or what number of individual chords it has received from each. Between the two points also, the first point of union, and the last of separation, many of the more minute component threads are detached from two or more of their trunks, and after first uniting with each other in an indis- tinct network, are again united to two or more of the nervous chords near the point at which they finally separate from the further end of union. This arrangement has been termed a, plexus, plait, or weaving, in consequence of the manner in which the nervous chords are interlaced or plait- ed together. The arrangement which we have noticed as consisting of the more minute nervous threads has been called a smaller plexus, (plexus minor.) It is a subordinate plexus within a lar- ger one. The best and most distinct example of a plexus is that commonly named the brachial or axillary.* * Imo nullibi fortasse clarior atque evidentior est haec multarum conjugationum nervearum consociatio atque com- mixtioj quam in hac nervorum spinalium \m\)\ica.tione plexum brachialem appellata. Ibi enim quinque memorati nervi spinales cervicales una convenientes, qua primum cohaerent, aut tribuunt aut mutuo dant et accipiunt a sociis stamina, quae demum in plures ramos consociata de plexu exeuntes brachiorum nervos faciunt ex omnibus illis quinque conju-

587 GRISTLE. structure is confirmed by Bichat, who says, that with a little attention it is possible to recognize longitudinal fibres, which are intersected by others in an oblique or transverse direction, but without determinate order. In its purest form no blood- vessels are seen in it, nor can they be demonstrated even by the finest injections. In the margins of those pieces of gristle, however, which are attach- ed to the extremities of growing bones, blood- vessels of considerable size may often be seen, even without the aid of injection. In young sub- jects a net-work of arteries and veins, which is de- scribed by Hunter under the name of circulus ar* ticuli vasculosus, may be demonstrated all round the margin of the cartilage at the line between the epiphysis and it. They terminate so abrupt- ly, however, that they cannot be traced into the substance of the latter. The most certain proofs, however, of the organic structure of this sub- stance are the serous exudation which appears in the course of a few seconds on the cut surface of a piece of cartilage after a clean division by the Jcnife ; and that it becomes yellow during jaundice, and derives colour from substances found in the blood. Neither absorbents nor nerves have been found in it. The ceUular texture said by Bichat to form the mould for the proper cartilaginous matter appears to be imaginary. The articular cartilages adhere to the epiphyses by one surface, which consists of short perpendi- cular fibres placed parallel to each other, and

DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 9 The distinction of the animal body into sepa- 1757. rate kinds of texture thus introduced and recog- nized was confined principally to anatomy and physiology. The merit of applying them to pa- thology is divided between William Hunter, Wil- liam Cullen, and John Hunter. The first, in a Paper on Emphysema, in the second volume of the Medical Observations and Inquiries, gave in 1762. 1757 an ingenious account of the difference be- tween the cellular texture and the adipose mem- brane, with some observations on the serous membranes, and showed in what manner the re- spective properties of each tend to modify their different morbid states. In the Nosology, Phy- ^7^5 siology, and First Lines of Dr Cullen, we find the j^gg author making frequent allusion to the organic 2^77 properties of the various substances which enter into the composition of the animal body, and em- ploying these distinctions as the foundation of his Pathology. In the hands of John Hunter this system was carried to still greater perfection ; and his work on Inflammation contains the rudi- ment of many of the improvements which Patho- logy has derived from this source. General anatomy was thus beginning to attain insensibly the form of a science, and to be culti- vated with assiduity as the surest basis of patho- logical knowledge. I must not omit to mention, that in the time of the elder Hunter and Cullen it underwent a valuable improvement in the hands of an ingenious foreigner. This consisted in the

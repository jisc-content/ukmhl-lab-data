GENERAL ANATOMY. 590 takes place either primarily or by extension from the perichondrium or the mucovis membrane of the throat. When it takes place primarily, it is re- presented by Mr Porter as preceded by ossifica- tion. When it takes place secondarily, it may oc- casionally be traced to ordinary inflammation from exposure to cold, the poison of syphilis, or the imfavourable operation of mercury. In either case it produces a bad species of ulceration, with mortification of the cartilages, which are some- times coughed up as dead sloughs. This consti- tutes one of the worst forms of laryngeal con- sumption, (phthisis lartjngea.*) In strumous subjects the cartilages of the nose are subject to a species of enlargement or thicken- ing, accompanied with increased vascularity, and terminating in unfavourable ulceration. In some instances, tyromatous deposition in the tubercular form takes place, and renders the nostrils tumid, irregularly knobbed and painful. This, which also tends to very bad ulceration, is one of the forms of the disease described under the general name of Noli me tangere. That it originates in the car- tilages I have observed more than once; and its ravages are seldom stopped till they are completely destroyed, leaving much deformity. It has been supposed that cartilage does not readily granulate. But this must be a mistake; for when bones are removed from articular cavi- * Observations on the Surgical Pathology of the Larynx and Trachea, &c. By W. H. Porter, A. M. &c. Dublin and London, 1826.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 80 teries going to the extremities, the axillary, and iliac, and their branches, receive nerves from the neighbouring nervous trunks, which are formed chiefly from cerebral or spinal nerves, and have no immediate connection with the system of the ganglions. In the internal carotid and the ver- tebral arteries, and their branches, nerves cannot be distinctly traced. * Organized in the manner now described, it is requisite to take a short view of the anatomical connections of the arterial system, or to consider it in its origin, its course, and its termination. The arterial system of the animal body may be viewed as one large trunk divided into several branches, which again are subdivided and ramified to a degree of minuteness which exceeds all calcu- lation. It is requisite therefore to consider the origin, 1*^, Of the aorta, the large trunk; 2c?, Of the branches which arise from it; and, Qdly, Of the small vessels into which these are divided. Every one knows that the aorta is connected at its origin with the upper and anterior part of the left venti'icle. The manner of this connection has been well examined by Lancisi, by Ludwig, and particularly by Bichat. It may be demonstrated by dissection, but is much more distinctly shown by boiling the heart with the blood-vessels attach- ed. In a heart so treated the thin internal mem- brane may be traced passing from the interior of * H. A. Wrisberg De Nervis Arterias Venasque comitan- tibus. Tome III.

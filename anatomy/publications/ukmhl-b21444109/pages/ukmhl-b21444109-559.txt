537 BONE. chemical qualities have not been much examined ; but an analysis by Berzelius shows that it con- sists chiefly of an oily matter, not unlike butter in general properties. The filaments, blood-ves- sels, albumen, gelatine, and osmazome found by this chemist in marrow, are to be regarded as de- rived from the filamentous tissue in which the medullary particles are deposited, and by no means to be arranged with it. They did not ex- ceed 4 parts in the 100. The medullary mem- brane, which has been considered as an internal periosteum, is but imperfectly known. There can be no doubt, however, of its existence, which is easily demonstrated by opening either trans- versely or longitudinally the medullary canal of a long bone, and boiling it for about two hours. The marrow then, as is well known to cooks, drops out; and it will be found on examination to be deposited in the interstices of a filamentous net-work of animal matter, which is not unlike very fine filamentous or cellular tissue, which may be traced not only into the lattice-work of the ex- tremities, but into the longitudinal canals of the cylindrical bones. It is traversed by blood-ves- sels, which are observed to bleed during amputa- tion. No nerves have been found in it. The medullary membrane, in short, may be regarded as an extensive net-work of very minute capilla- ries united by delicate filamentous tissue. From these capillaries the marrow is deposited as a se- cretion.â€”(Mascagni, Howship.)

In the cavernous bodies of the penis and clitoris he had not sufficient facts to ascertain the exist- ence of the same structure, as he had never suc- ceeded in injecting these parts so completely as the glans and the spongy part of the urethra. Eventually, however, he succeeded, especially in children, in injecting fully these cavernous bodies of the penis and clitoris. He found in their in- terior nothing but fasciculi of veins, with cor- responding arteries, but rather smaller. He infer- red, therefore, that these vessels, collected and rami- fied in various directions, constitute a vascular tex- ture capable of expanding and shrinlcing, according to the quantity of blood conveyed to it. f The general accuracy of this description has been since confirmed by the researches of Paul Farnese and Moreschi.

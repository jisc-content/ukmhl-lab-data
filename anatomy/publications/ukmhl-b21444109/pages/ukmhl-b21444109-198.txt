GENEUAL AXATOMV. 176 symptoms of fever is pain, soreness, and a sense of bruising in the muscular parts and limbs in ge- neral. In fatal cases, when these parts are exa- mined by incision, unusual vascular distension and extravasation of blood are frequently seen. The livid spots and patches, (vibices, eccliymomata) are proofs of the same state of the capillaries of the filamentous tissue, as petechial eruptions de- note this in the skin. In short, there is scarcely a texture or organ of the animal body, the capillaries of Avhich are not disordered in the different forms of fever ; and this disorder, instead of being confined to the ca- pillaries of a single organ, is extended throughout the capillary system at large. It is doubtless true that in individual cases this disorder may be greater and more distinct in one set of capillaries than in another. In one set of patients the capillaries of the brain may appear to be most disordered; in another those of the lungs ; in a third those of the intestinal canal; and in a fourth those of the urinary organs. It is always found, however, in such cases, that the affection of one organ does not entirely exclude that of another ; and while the capillaries of the one are very much affected, though those of the others are less so, they are by no means in the healthy state. In all cases of severe and exquisite fever, whether intermittent, remittent, or continued, the capilla- ries of the brain, of the lungs and heart, of the chylopoietic organs, of the urinary organs, of the 4

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 163 ing to the inflammation bt/ congestioti of Par^, Hildanus, Wiseman, and the older surgeons, and causing the cold abscess to which I had occasion formerly to allude. But, with the exception of its being attended with little or no pain, and proceed- ing much more slowly than acute inflammation, little is known regarding the anatomical and pa- thological characters of this form of the process. From several circumstances it might be inferred that the capillaries begin to assume the suppura- tive action, at least in filamentous tissue, more readily than in the case of acute inflammation. In other parts chronic inflammation may exist without terminating in the suppurative process. In cases in which the acute seems to be com- bined with the chronic, so as to form an interme- diate or mixed variety of disease, it has been dis- tinguished by the name of subacute inflammation. Under certain circumstances chronic inflamma- tion may terminate in the acute. Thus an ab- scess in the cavity of a joint, either by distension or by propagation of action, may induce inflam- mation in the subcutaneous cellular tissue and in the skin. When a chronic abscess is opened, its whole interior surface is attacked with acute in- flammation ; and when a lumbar abscess is opened, or is allowed to burst, the same effect results. By carefuUy excluding the air, indeed, and healing up the wound according to the manner of Mr Aber- nethy, the severity of this inflammation may be much mitigated; but it always takes place, and

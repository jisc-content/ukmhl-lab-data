BONE. 553 Mr Hunter, a variety of the adhesive. In this three distinct stages are enumerated. In the first, effusion of blood from the periosteal vessels into its substance, and from the medullary vessels into the fracture, is after coagulation followed by effu- sion of a colourless viscid fluid, which also coagu- lates into a jelly. (J. Hunter, Bichat, Howship, &c.) In the second, the soft parts, and especially the periosteum, become hot, red, swollen, and, in short, are in a state of inflammation. (Du Hamel, Howship, &c.) If at this time the fracture be examined, the periosteal and medullary arteries at the line of fracture are large, numerous, and are seen emitting vessels into the coagulated blood and lymph effused beneath the periosteum, and from the broken ends, and converting them into organized masses, sometimes distinct like granu- lations, sometimes irregularly continuous. This substance, which is of a reddish-gray colour, and of the consistence of firm jelly, is what is named callus. The third stage may be distinguished by the appearance of osseous points which now begin to be deposited from the new vessels, which pene- trate from the periosteum and medullary filaments to the callus. As the arterial action advances, these osseous points extend from the broken sur- face and coalesce. The exterior swelling at the same time diminishes and disappears; the peri- osteum falls to its natural size and its ordinary rate of vascularity ; the medullary canal is re- stored in greater or less perfection; and the

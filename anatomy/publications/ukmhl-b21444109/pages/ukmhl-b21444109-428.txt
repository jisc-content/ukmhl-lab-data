406 GENERAL ANATOMY. traced in the pulpy matter and in the bloody clot, either recent or dissolved into the chocolate-co- loured fluid. By some these filamentous threads are supposed to be the fine cellular tissue of the brain; but I think it impossible to doubt, that they are minute capillary vessels. This general de- scription I have derived partly from the descrip- tions of Rochoux,* but especially from those of Ler- minier and Serres,t and partly from personal ob- servation. The change in the structure and consistence of the brain surrounding the clot forms one variety of softening {ramolUssemevit,) or pulpy disorgani- zation ; and notwithstanding the opinion express- ed by Pariset, Recamier, Rochoux, X ^^d others, that it is the cause of the effusion, it is invariably the effect either of this or of the preliminary in- jection. This is established not only by the facts already mentioned, but by the cases of Morgagni, of M. Dan de la Vauterie, ยง and especially by those of Lerminier and Serres. || Vascular injection, with or without bloody ef- fusion, may take place in any part of the brain ; but certain parts are much more commonly the seat of this discharge than others.

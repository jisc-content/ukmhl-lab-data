747 SEROUS MEMBRANE. stance of the capsular part is probably a mo- dification of the white fibrous system ; but it re- quires to be more carefully examined. No nerves have been traced into any part of this membrane, nor is it quite certain that it contains lymphatics. The cerebral membranes are not uniform in nature, and cannot be conveniently referred to any head save that of compound membranes. The dura mater is fibrous ; the pia mater is sup- posed to be celluloso-vascular; and Bichat has la- boured to demonstrate that the arachnoid is a serous membrane,â€”a view which is adopted by Meckel and Beclard, but rejected by Gordon. By configuration and disposition, I believe it is more easily referable to this than to any other class ; and I therefore introduce its anatomical history in this place. The brain has been said to be surrounded by three membranous envelopes, the hard membrane {meuinx dura, dura mater), the web-like mem- brane {tunica arachnoidea), and the soft or thin membrane, {meninx tetiuis, j^i^^ mater.) There is perhaps no great or just objection to this arrange- ment, which has been adopted by almost all writers. But it simplifies the subject, without impairing the truth of what is observed, to refer them to two only; one of which, the hard membrane {meninx dura, [jtjfjvi'y^ aKl.ri^ri, dura mater), is common to the brain with the inner surface of the scull; the other, the thin membrane {meninx tennis, (Jij'^viy^ XiTTf], pia mater), is proper to the brain only. They may be

So uniform is this fact, that arteries of moderate size have been torn by a trans- verse laceration without effusing more than a few drops of blood. Aneurismal Varix. It sometimes happens that an artery subjacent to, and in immediate contact with a vein is punctured by the same instrument with which the vein has been per- forated, and the wound thus inflicted establish- es between the two vessels a communication through which the blood passes from the one to the other. Thus, from want of caution on the part of the operator, it may happen that in ve- nesection at the bend of the arm the lancet may not only transfix the vein, but wound the subja- cent artery. The blood flows from the latter into the former with a peculiar hissing noise, and di- lates it into which disappears on pressure, but returns when the pressure is removed. The tumour thus formed, which depends on the wound of the arterial and venous tunic remaining open while their sides are in contact, was first distin- guished as a peculiar affection by William Hun- ter, * and is known under the name of aneurismal varix. It may occur in any part of the vascular system in which a vein lies immediately over an arterial trunk. In most of the cases hitherto re-

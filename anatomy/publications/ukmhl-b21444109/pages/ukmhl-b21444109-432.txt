410 GENERAL ANATOMY. of the brain, the medulla oblongata, and the cere- hellum, in the order now enumerated. When hemorrhage takes place into the annular protuberance, the blood is generally deposited in layers in the interstices between the transverse fi- bres. In one fatal case I observed this so distinct- ly, that the blood and cerebral matter formed al- ternating layers. When it is very abundant, how- ever, the transverse fibres are broken through, and the effused blood is contained in irregular cavities. (Cheyne, case 9j Serres, Tacheron.) The proxi- mity of the protuberance to the large transverse branches of the basilar artery affords some reason for the readiness with which it may be affected with vascular injection and hemorrhage. Of effusion into the cerebellum little is accu- rately known. Morgagni records two cases, one in both hemispheres, most in the left; and it is in- teresting to remark, that he lays particular stress on the pulpy state of the surrounding substance of the cerebellic hemisphere.* In the other, it ap- pears to have been more recent. In a case by Dr Abercrombie a clot was found in the right hemi- sphere. Howship furnishes a curious case of ex- travasation into the medulla ohlotigata, in which parallel layers of blood were deposited transverse- ly in the substance of the part.f (Case 20.) * " Ea autem portio cerebelli quae corpus ejusmodi cir- caxa^iabat, fracida erat."

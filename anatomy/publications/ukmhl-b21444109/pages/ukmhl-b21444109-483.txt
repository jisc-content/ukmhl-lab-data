BRAIN. 461 abscesses, it may indeed become a question whe- ther the fluid or the solid state is the incipient one. The principal facts in favour of the latter idea are, the circumstances of the fluid being found in the centre while the circumference is solid, and the larger bodies being found soft while the small are firm. According to this, which is the gene- ral opinion at present, in the incipient stage the tubercle is said to be crude, in the more advanced to be softened or dissolved. h. The second form in which tubercular deposition takes place is when it is found in numerous mi- nute spherical or spheroidal bodies, disseminated through the substance of the brain. Of this the best examples with which I am acquainted are recorded by Reil and M. Chomel. In the case given by Professor Reil more than 200 oblong- spherical bodies wei'e found in the gray matter of the brain and cerebellum. They were a little fir- mer than the brain itself; mostly of a pale yellow ; some few of a very pale blue colour ; of the size of a lentile or a pea; and when divided, showed in- ternally an adipose-like substance, resembling in colour and consistence boiled or beaten potatoes. From some which were marked in the centre with a dark point, and seemed to be covered by a thin cyst, the slightest incision discharged a matter like vermicelli. These bodies were confined to the gray or external matter, none being found in the white cerebral substance.* Not dissimilar were the bodies found by M. Chomel in the brain of a * J. C.

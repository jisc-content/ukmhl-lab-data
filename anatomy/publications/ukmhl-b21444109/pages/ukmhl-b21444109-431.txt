BRAIK. 409 right optic thalamus, one cyst was found in the neighbourhood of the cylindroid eminence, another in the centre of the left optic thalamus, and a third in the annular protuberance. * Upon the whole, we are in possession of few very accurate elements to determine this question. From the authentic cases, however, which I have perused, for it is in vain to draw conclusions from individvial observation only, I think there are grounds to infer, that, next to the striated nucleus, the hemispheres are the most frequent seat of ce- rebral injection and hemorrhage. It is worthy of remark, that the extravasation, when it takes place, does so chiefly on the outer side of the lateral ven- tricle, generally towards its posterior end, and in that portion of brain which forms the external-late- ral boundary of the optic thalamus, separated from the ventricle by a thin plate. Into the ventricle it rarely takes place primarily; and when blood is found there, it is the result either of bloody ex- travasation in the hemisphere breaking down the floor,f the wall, or the ceiling of the ventricle, or, as shall be afterwards shown, it issues from the choroid 'plexus. The same remark applies to blood on the surface of the brain. Next to the hemispheres in hemorrhagic ten- dency may be placed the protuberance, the limbs * Recherches Anatomico-Pathologiques, &c. par C. F. Tacheron, Doct, a Medecine, &c. Tome I lime.

411 BRAIN. Genuine hemorrhage of the brain, as now de- scribed, though issuing from the capillaries, is thought not to take place by exhalation. * It is never possible to trace it to a single vessel; and hemorrhage from rupture of an arterial trunk, though producing the same symptoms, belongs anatomically to a different head. Cheyne, f and more recently Lerminier and Serres, appear to have found always many minute capillaries open- ing into the hemorrhagic cavity. On the greater frequency of affection of the right side of the brain nothing very satisfactory has been ascertained. Morgagni believing it, ascribes it to the greater frequency with which the muscles of the right side are used than those of the left. In 41 cases, however, given by Rochoux, the ijLumber in the left was 18, that in the right 17, and that in both sides 6, which proves that this cannot be established with any precision. It is important to ascertain the influence which bloody effusion in different parts of the brain, exerts on the functions of sensation, voluntary motion, and the muscles of respiration. For there is reason to believe, that, according as con- gestion or hemorrhage takes place in the he- mispheres, in the striated bodies, in the annular protuberance, in the cerebellum, or in the medulla oblongata, the effects produced will be palsy, or apoplexy more or less violent, and with different * Bichat, Anatomie Generale, Tome II. article iii. p. 279, t Cases of Apoplexy and Lethargy. 8vo, London, 1812.

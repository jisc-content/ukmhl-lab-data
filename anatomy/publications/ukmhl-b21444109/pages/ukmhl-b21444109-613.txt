GRISTLE. 589 cular, and flaccid, or soft and spongy, with a lar- daceous appearance and distinct fibrous arrange- ment. It swells and acquires a size double or even four times larger than natural. In this state it does not become yellow, nor is dissolved by boiling. This is most common in the hip-joint. (Bichat.) When inflammation continues some time, it produces erosion. The first trace of this consists in minute reddish perforations appearing at the synovial surface of the cartilage, and gradually extending and becoming deeper. At first they are circular; but as these perforations by extension coalesce, irregular abraded patches are produced, which at length become so deep as to expose the denuded bone. When this takes place, as the pro- cess advances, irregular excavations are hollowed in the epiphyses, which then present the state described at p. 574. This form of caries, which resembles in some respects sspina ventosa, is, I con- ceive, the one to which Severinus alludes, and to which he wishes to restrict the epithet of paedar throcace. I have seen it in adults, however; and it is most frequent in the knee-joint, in which I have seen it remove every trace of cartilage. In this process Hunter represents the transverse fibres as giving way first; but this distinction is too refined. The disease may terminate in bony ankylosis. It occurs also in the hip-joint and in the elbow-joint. In the cartilages of the larynx inflammation

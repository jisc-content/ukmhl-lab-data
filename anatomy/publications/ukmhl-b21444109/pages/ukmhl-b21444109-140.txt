GENERAL ANATOMY. 118 Valves are not uniformly present In all veins. They are found, 1*/, In the following branches of the superior great vein ;â€”the internal jugular, the azygos, the facial veins, those of the arms, &e. 2df In the following branches of the inferior great vein; the divisions of the posterior iliac, of the fe- moral, tibial, internal and external saphena, and in the spermatic veins of the male. They are wanting in the trunk of the inferior great vein {cava itiferior,) in the renal, mesenteric, and other abdominal veins, in the portal vein, in the cerebral sinuses, in the veins of the brain and spinal chord, in the veins of the heart, of the womb generally, and of the ovaries, and perhaps in all other veins less than a line in diameter. * In the cerebral sinuses the transverse chords are supposed to supply their place. In situation the valves vary considerably. In general they are found in those parts of venous canals at which a small vein opens into a larger. But even from this arrangement there are devia- tions. The only valve which is definite and in- variable in its situation is the Eustachian, {valvula Eustachiana, valmda nohilis), which is always placed at the cardiac end or beginning of the in- ferior cava, where that vessel is attached to the sinus of the right auricle. Shaped in general like a crescent, the attached margin of which is the arch of a large circle, and the free that of a small one, it proceeds from the left extremity of the si- " Haller, Lib. ii. sect. ii.

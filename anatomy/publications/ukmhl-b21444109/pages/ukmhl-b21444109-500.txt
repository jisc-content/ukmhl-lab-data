GENERAL ANATOMY. 478 Upon the whole, though the occurrence of the genuine solitary animal hydatid in the brain may not be impossible, it is not clear that any of the cases hitherto recorded belong to this head. They are to be regarded rather as serous or vesicular cysts, (Portal, Anat. Med. Tome iv. p. 72,) or ex- amples of the tumour called (hijgroma). Of this kind also are the case described by Forlani of Sienna, containing glvitinous matter like white of egg,* and the globular cysts so beautifully repre- sented by Dr Hooper in his fourteenth engraving. The cases mentioned by Fischer, Zeder, and others, belong to the membranes. b. Steatoms are mentioned by Drelincurtius, Thomann, Home, and Bouillaud. c. The blood-cyst, {hcematoma). The occurrence of this in the brain, though not common, has been observed. Like haematoma in other regions, it consists of a membranous cyst, sometimes con- taining small cysts, the inner surface of which is composed of a vascular tissue, from which blood or bloody fluid exudes by exhalation, forming a mass resembling layers of coagulated blood. Of this disease the most distinct example is given by Ro- choux. A man of 65, about twenty months after a violent blow on the head which stunned him, be- gan to feel pain and weight of the head, with oc- casional moments of forgetfulness. These symp- toms became more severe and more frequent, were followed by embarrassed speech, palsy of the left â€¢ Caspar M. Forlani, Obs, Med. Pract. Anat. Senis, 1769.

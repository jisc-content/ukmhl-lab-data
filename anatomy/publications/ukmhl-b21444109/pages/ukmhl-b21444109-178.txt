GENERAI, ANATOMY. 156 inflamed, resumes by degrees its natural state, without suffering derangement of structure or properties. This is exceedingly rare. The mi- nute veins are doubtless the great agents of cure in such circumstances. |3. In most cases of inflammation more or less fluid is early effused or extravasated from the ca- pillaries or the exhalants of the part. No sooner do the vessels become overloaded with blood than part of it either entire, or in the form of serous fluid, is separated from the vessels. Thus in in- flammation of filamentous tissue blood or sermn may be poured into its interstitial spaces; and the effusion of the latter is one cause of oedema- tous and anasarcous infiltration. In inflammation of the serous membranes also we shall find that effusion of serous fluid is an early and frequent result. When this effusion is moderate it may be re- moved under suitable management by the action of the veins and lymphatics ; and in such circum- stances this termination would still come imder the head of resolution. y. In general, however, the fluid effused is of a more complicated nature. The natiu-al tendency of the process of inflammation is to cause the ves- sels to secrete or exhale, or effuse a fluid which at once contains coagulable lymph and a thinner se- rum, which, at a later period, at least in the fila- mentous tissue, corresponds to sero-purulent or purulent fluid. This serum is not converted, as

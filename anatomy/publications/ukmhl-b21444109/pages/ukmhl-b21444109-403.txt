That it takes place in the inflammatory or dis- organizing process which succeeds mechanical in- jury is established by the necrological appearances found in the brain in such circumstances. (Fantoni, Morgagni, Louis, Le Dran, Sclimucker, O'Hallo- ran, Dease, Abernethy, Thomson, Hennen, &c.) When softening takes place in connection with serous effusion, it is partly the concurrent effect of inflammation, partly of the effused fluid. This is well illustrated in those cases in which the sep- tum lucidum is attenuated, reticular, and perfora- ted, or at length ruptured. This form of destruc- tion, accompanied with more or less softening of the twain-band, (fornix) is repeatedly men- tioned by Morgagni, and has been noticed by most authors who have described cases of water in the cerebral cavities. I have seen it both in the true hydrocephalic effusion, and in that which takes place in continued fever. Not only does pulpy disorganization occur in this part of the organ in continued fever, but it takes place in the substance of the hemispheres. Of this pathological fact good instances are given by Jemina, as they occurred in an epidemic at Montreal, in the territory of Turin, in 1783-84. In one the white mater of the hemisphere {cen- trum ovale) was soft, pulpy, (fracidum,) of an ash- colour, passing into yellow, and pasty ; in another it was soft and tawny-coloured, like spoilt fruit; and in a third the cerebellum was similarly

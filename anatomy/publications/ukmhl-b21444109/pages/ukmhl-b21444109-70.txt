GENERAL ANATOMY. 50 air is produced by the decomposition of the serum of the blood in the morbid parts. 8. Vascular Sarcoma. (Abernethy.) The tu- mour known under this name is, of all the new growths incident to the animal tissues, the most simple in structure. I refer it to this head for two reasons. 1st, It appears to occur chiefly where filamentous or cellular tissue is found ; and when it occurs among muscles, or in the substance of organs, it appears still to be referable to the filamentous tissue which enters into the composi- tion of the texture in which it appears, ^d, The structure of this tumour is principally filamentous tissue condensed or modified by the local morbid action. Every instance of vascular sarcoma may be viewed as a new developement and hypertro- phic augmentation of its proper substance in a particular point of the filamentous tissue. The tumour is always liberally supplied with blood from vessels which, if not more numerous, are greatly larger and more capacious than in the na- tural state ; and if this be not the cause of the unusual deposition of substance, it must be re- garded as the channel by which the additional matter is conveyed. It is also possible that the irritation resulting from the first effusion of blood, or other coagulable matter, which, according to Mr Abernethy, is the usual cause of tumours, may excite the vessels of the neighbouring parts so much as to cause their capacity to be enlarged, and to convey a more copious supply of blood.

160 GENERAL ANATO^IV granulation. I shall afterwards have occasion to mention another sort of purulent collections, in which granulation never occurs. Suppuration varies according to the natui'e of the inflammatory process which it succeeds, and according to the texture in which it takes place. As inflammation varies according to the nature of the texture in which it takes place, so its effects are different in the different organic textures. The purulent matter formed on the skin differs from that which flows from an abscess of the cel- lular tissue. That secreted by mucous membranes is different from either; and even the purident fluid of serous membranes possesses certain cha- racters by which a careful observer may distin- guish it from the same fluid in other situations. The suppurating process may be varied accord- ing to the nature of the inflammation by which it is preceded. A sound principle laid down by John Hunter was to regard every form of suppuration as the result of inflammation. From this, how- ever, he departed in his views of the nature of sujipurations of lymphatic glands, of diseased joints, of lumbar abscesses, and of the cold or chro- nic abscess in general. * It is easy to show, that, * Many indolent tumours, slow swellings in the joints, swellings of the lymphatic glands, tubercles in the lungs, and swellings in many parts of the body, are diseased thick- enings, without visible inflammation. And the contents of some kinds of encysted tumour ; the matter of many scrofu- lous suj)puratious, as in lymphatic glands ; the suppuration

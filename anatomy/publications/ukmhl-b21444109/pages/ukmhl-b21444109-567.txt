BONE. 545 fore, and its vessels must be ascribed the process of foetal ossification. Of this a cumulative proof may- be found in the circumstance, that the periosteum adheres more firmly at the ends than the middle of the bones ; and that the pericranium and dura mater, which perform the part of periosteum to the bones of the scull, are visibly concerned in the formation and successive enlargement of these bones. But though the periosteal vessels are the main agents of ossification originally, there is rea- son to believe that the medullary vessels contribute to its growth and nutrition after it is formed. This may be inferred from the phenomena of fractures, of diseases of the bones, and of those experiments in which the medullary membrane is injured. The periosteum, however, does not act by ossification of its inner layers, as Du Hamel, misled by a false analogy between the growth of trees and bones, laboured to establish. This leads naturally to the examination of the phenomena of ossification as a process of repair. This, how- ever, is introduced more properly under the next section. The teeth, as a variety of bone, demand attention. Every tooth consists of two hard parts ; one exter- nal, white, iiniform, somewhat like ivory; the other internal, similar to the compact structure of bone. The first, which is named enamel, is seen only at the crown of the tooth, the upper and outer part of which consists of this substance. It is white, very close in texture, perfectly uniform M m

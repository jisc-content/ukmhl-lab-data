Though found chief- ly in young subjects, it may occur in the brains of adults ; but is rarely seen in the aged.* Melanosis.â€”The melanotic deposit has not been very often found in the brain. Streaks of dark matter along the blood-vessels were seen by Dr Alison and Mr Fawdington ; f and Dr Hooper delineates melanotic masses of small size in the substance of the organ. X Of these several changes now enumerated, the effects, in general uniform, may be said to vary only according, \st, to the morbid changes induced in the contiguous cerebral substance ; ^d, accord- ing to the extent which the organic change occu- pies ; and Sdly, according to its relative situation in the organ. 1. All the tumours above enumerated, indepen- dent of the changes proper to their own structure, agree in producing certain common changes in the contiguous cerebral substance.

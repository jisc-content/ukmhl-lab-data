198 GENERAL ANATOMY. invisible with the Hallerian, was, for obvious rea- sons, denied by Bichat, who resolved to reject every opinion not fonnded on anatomical observa- tion, and to determine the existence of the exha- lants by this evidence alone. Obhged, however, to avow the difficulty of forming a distinct idea of a system of vessels, the extreme tenuity of M'hicli prevented them from being seen, he undertook to attain his object by what he terms a rigorous train of reasoning. This consists in nothing more than the effects observed to result from fine and successful injec- tions of watery fluids, or of spirit of turpentine containing some finely levigated colouring matter, from the phenomena of active hemorrhage, which Bichat considers merely as exhalation of blood in- stead of serous fluid, and from a nniltitude of con- siderations which are to be unfolded in the course of further examination of the subject. In this manner he believes himself warranted to conclude, that the only things rigorously ascertained are, Isf, The existence of exhalants ; 2d, Their origin in the capiUary system of the part in which they are distributed ; and, 3d, Their termination on the surfaces of serous and mucous membranes, and the outer surface of the corion or true skin. The exlialant vessels, tlie existence, origin, and termination of Av^hich he thus proved, he distin- guished into three classes. The first contains those exhalants which are concerned in the production of the fluids, which are immediately removed from

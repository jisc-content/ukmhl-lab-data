LYMPHATIC GLAND OR GANGLION. J^45 gradual enlargement, without much pain or change of colour in the integuments. At length, the gland is found to become softer than it had been, andan open- ing takes place in the skin, through which a fluid is discharged, not homogeneous, but in general con- sisting of a thin serous water, in which thicker pieces like curd are mixed. This fluid, which is ge- nerally most completely formed in suppuration of the lymphatic glands, is what has been termed scro- fulous, or strumous matter. Simple strumous en- largement in these glands may proceed to such an extent as to interfere with, and even impede the functions of important organs. In those of the neck they have, by compressing the windpipe, caused fatal suffocation. (Soemmering and others.) Bleuland saw them in an infant impede degluti- tion by pressing the oesophagus. * y. Irritative Enlargement. The lymphatic glands are liable to become painful and enlarged, in consequence of causes not originally resident in themselves. A sore or wound, especially if punc- tured or lacerated, on the hand or foot, may be suc- ceeded in a few days by an enlarged painful swel- ling of one or more glands in the arm-pit or groin. A wound of the scalp may be followed by a glan- dular swelling of the neck; and a spoilt tooth, or a sore of the mouth, will often give rise to a pain- ful enlargement of the glands under the jaw. I have repeatedly seen a whole chain of them en- large, and continue so for months, in consequence â€¢ Observationes de sana et morbosa CEsophagi Structura. Lugdun. Bat. 1785.

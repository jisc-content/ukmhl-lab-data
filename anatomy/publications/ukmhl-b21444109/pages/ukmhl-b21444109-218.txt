This disease differs from anastomotic aneurism in its pulsation and distension being at all times the same, and in not presenting the phenomena of erection. Though it is mentioned in this place from its general resemblance to that disease, it may be more justly regarded as genuine aneurism of the capillaries. CHAPTER VIII. System of Exhalants, ( Vasa exhalantia.)â€” ExHALANT System, (Systeme Exhalant.) Section I. Are there such vessels as the exhalants describ- ed by physiological authors ? Is their existence proved by observation or inspection ? If not, what are the proofs from which their existence has been inferred ? The existence of minute arteries, the open ex- tremities of which are believed to pour out various fluids in different tissues of the himian body, has long been a favourite speculation with physiologi- cal anatomists. The decreasing vessels (vasculo-

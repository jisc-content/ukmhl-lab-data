704 GENERAL ANATOMY". more apparent than in any other part of the gastro-enteric membrane. From the recent observations of Dr Bright, nevertheless;, no doubt can be entertained of the fact, that in- flammation and sloughing of the mucous follicles is a frequent cause of ulcers. The comparative frequency of ulcers in different regions of the gastro-enteric surface during fever may be under- stood from the following table, in which Andral gives the result of 71 necroscopic inspections. Cases. Ulcers of the Stomach in 10 Duodenum, 1 Jejunum, 9 Lower part of the ileum, 38 Cases. Coecum, 15 Ascending colon. 4 Transverse arch, 11 Descending colon, 3 Rectum, 1 According to this statement, which is on the whole accu- rate, ulcers are most frequent in the lower end of the ileum, nearly in the proportion of one-half of the cases, next to this in the coecum in about one fifth of the cases, then in the transverse arch, in the stomach, and in the jejunum. In the ascending and descending colon, they are not very com- mon, and in the duodenum and rectum extremely rare. Their progress and effects are the same as when taking place idiopathically. In some instances of fever, Andral remarked that portions of the intestinal mucous corion appeared to be suddenly struck by mortification, forming a species of mucous car- buncle f anthracion,) and like that requiring to be thrown off by a long process of ulceration. The eschars thus dis- charged left ulcers extensive and irregular. Variolous inflammation.â€”It has been an opinion not un- common, that the variolous poison produces in the mucous surfaces, and especially along the tract of the gastro-enteric mucous membrane pustules, similar to those of the skin ; and sundry instances of papilla, pustules, and similar bodies in the stomach or intestines, recorded by Lieutaud, have been supposed to give countenance to this idea. Upon this point.

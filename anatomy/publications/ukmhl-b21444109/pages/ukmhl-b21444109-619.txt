595 FIBRO-CARTILAGE. chondrodesmoid tissue, is not uncommon ; and its appearance constitutes the anatomical charac- ter of the most usual form of scirrho-carcinoma. In this state irregular or amorphous masses of fibro-cartilage are developed in isolated points of the organs ; and by their coalescence progressive- ly invade or destroy the original texture of the part. In some instances a mass of cartilage is tra- versed irregularly by intersecting white or yellow fibrous bands. In others irregular nodules of cartilage are separated by ligamentous partitions. This deposition, which ever manifests a tendency to fatal disorganization, is most frequent in the female breast, in the womb, in the lacrymal and parotid glands, and in the intestinal canal of both sexes. In its progress to ulceration cavities are formed containing brownish jelly-like fluid ; and as it approaches the surface, fungous growths and hemorrhage are frequent. The organic substances which have been already described consist either of those which are rami- fied or distributed extensively through the animal body, or of those which are confined to definite situations. Those which are now to be examin- ed are extended continuously over considerable spaces, and tissues or organs very different some- times from each other. They are envelopes or membranes, and consist of skin, mucous mem- brane, serous membrane, synovial membrane, and compound membrane.

527 BONE. Several attempts have at different times been made to ascertain the atomic constitution of bone, but without much success. Malpighi, though he corrected the extravagant fiction of Gagliardi re- garding the osseous plates and nails, fancied bones to be composed of filaments, which Lewenhoeck represented as minute hollow tubes ; (tubuli.) By Clopton Flavers, again, the ultimate particles of bone were imagined to be fibres aggregated into plates (lamintB) placed on each other, and traver- sed by longitudinal and transverse hollows or pores, (pori.) * This view was adopted by Cour- tial, f Winslow, % Palfyn, \ Monro, || and Rei- chel, ^ who was at some pains to demonstrate this arrangement of plates and minute tubes by microscopical observation. These notions were first questioned by Scarpa, who, in 1799, under- took to show by examinations of bone deprived of its earth by acid, and long macerated in pure water, that it consists, both externally and inter- nally, of reticular or cellular structure. ** So far as I understand what idea this eminent anatomist attaches to the teft'ms reticular and cellular^ I doubt whether this opinion is better founded than any of the previous ones. After repeating his experiment of immersing in oil of turpentine, bone macerated in acid, I cannot perceive the re- * Osteologia Nova.

119 VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. nus downwards, forwards, and towards the left side, where it is insensibly lost on the membrane of the auricular septum. At its lower end it generally covers the orifice of the large coronary vein. This membranous production is always larger,more per- fect, and more distinct in the foetus, and in the in- fant, than in the adult. In the latter it is almost always reticulated; and sometimes the only vestige of its existence is a thin chord or two representing its anterior margin. 1 have seen it reticulated even at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and almost de- stroyed beyond thirty. Haller was much per- plexed to account for the use of this membranous fold. * The conjecture of Bichat, that it is con- nected with some purpose in the foetal circulation, is entitled to regard. Dr Gordon has mentioned a third partial sub- stance, which is occasionally found in local patches at various parts of veins. I have never met with - this, and believe it to be accidental, or not con- nected with healthy structure. Besides the cellular or filamentous envelope, veins receive capillary arteries, to which there are corresponding veins. The arteries rise from the nearest small ramifying arteries ; and the corre- sponding veins do not terminate in the cavity of the vein to which they belong, but pass off from its body, and join some others from different parts; and at last terminate in the common trunk some â€¢ Haller de Valvula Eustachii.

ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 101 tends the filamentous or membranous sheath into a cyst or sac, between which and the tunics it is found in successive layers. In several aneu- risms the first step of the process is mere dilata- tion of the arterial tunics, either partial or gene- ral. When this has proceeded to a certain ex- tent, varying in different cases, the arterial tissues give way, and the same process of hemorrhage and coagulation in successive layers results. It appears, therefore, that in every case of aneurism there is eventually laceration. The only difference is in the mode of origin, wliicli in some is rupture, and in others mere dilatation. * In its final result an aneurismal sac bursts in one of two modes. 1*^, When it bursts into the cavity of any of the serous membranes, as the pleura, pericar- dium, or peritonaeum, the breach is formed by la- ceration. 2d, When it bursts through the skin or into cavities lined by a mucous membrane the breach is the effect of sloughing and ulceration. Certain divisions of the arterial system are evi- dently more liable than others to aneurism ; and in general the comjjarative liability may be traced to the greater or less susceptibility of disease of the tunics, and the situation of the vessel in being exposed to frequent or extensive motion. Hence aneurisms are ceteris paribus more frequently ob- served at the flexures of joints than elsewhere. Aneurisms are also more frequent in men than in women.

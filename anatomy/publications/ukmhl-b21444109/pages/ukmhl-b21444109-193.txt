SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 171 the minute, while in ordinary cases the applica- tion of the stethoscope indicates an embarrassed state of the circulation in the pulmonary capilla- ries. In persons predisposed, expectoration streak- ed with blood, {hcemoptoe,) is not unfrequent during- continued fever. The same conclusion is clearly established by examination of the lungs of persons cut off either by intermittent or by continued fever. In many instances of the former it induces bronchial in- flammation, or proceeds to actual peripneumony or pleurisy, constituting the catarrhal, pneumonic, or pleuritic tertian respectively. (Werlhof, Torti, Lancisi, &c.) In the latter, the bronchial mucous membrane is always more or less red, sometimes crimson or purple, and much thickened ; the sub- mucous tissue is brown and loaded with serous fluid ; and the minute vessels are much distended with dark-coloured blood. The serous surface of the organ is generally livid or marbled from this cause ; but the pleura itself is not much changed, save from bloody serum discharged into its cavity. The lungs in totality are generally dense, and fir- mer than in the natural state. These changes arise from the minute ramifying vessels at the termination of the pulmonary artery, and the origins of the pulmonary veins being un- usually loaded with blood. As they are more so than can be readily affected by the ordinary quan- tity of air admissible in such a state, imperfect respiration and undue change of venous blood

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 165 inflammation from injury, as wound, tear, burn, &c., death of a part occasioned either by mortifi- cation, or by the cautery, actual or potential, or the application of a morbid poison. Ulceration occurs in the mucous membranes under the same circumstances as in the skin, and also after spontaneous inflammation, that is, in- flammation coming on without manifest cause. Ulceration occurs in the cellular tissue in con- sequence of the pressure and progressive advance- ment of a large abscess; in consequence of the presence of foreign bodies, as bullets, sword-points, pins, &c.; or the sharp end of a bone. Ulceration is not common in serous membranes. In these, however, it takes place in consequence of the continued pressure of large collections of matter. This is seen in empyema and collections of purulent matter in the peritonaeum. Ulceration occurs in bone either spontaneously, or in consequence of the death of part of it. The former is seen in caries; the latter in necrosis and exfoliation. Ulceration occurs in cartilage in consequence of inflammation. This is seen in diseases of the knee-joint and hip-joint. In all cases of ulceration the capillaries of the parts are larger and more numerous than natural, and certainly contain more blood than in the state of health. This is seen very well in the case of ulcers of the cornea, which are invariably sur- rounded by an annular net-work of small vessels,

115 VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. ed from the superior and inferior great veins over the inner surface of the right auricle and ventri- cle, and thence over that of the pulmonary artery and its divisions; and through this whole tract it is the same in structure and properties. This doctrine has not yet been controverted. But perhaps it may be doubted, both with regard to the inner arterial membrane, that the inner tunic of the aorta and of the pulmonary veins is quite the same; and in regard to this inner venous membrane, whether that of the veins in general is quite the same with that of the pulmonary ar- tery. The subject demands further research. Meanwhile strong confirmation is found in the in- teresting remark of Bichat, that the osseous or calcareous depositions which are common in va- rious spots of the inner arterial membrane, and especially at the mitral and aortic valves, are never found in the inner venous membrane, or at the tri- cuspid valve, or in the semilunar valves of the pul- monary artery. Have these depositions been found inside the pidmonary veins, and not inside the pul- monary artery ? This fact is still wanting to com- plete even their pathological similarity. The inner or common venous membrane is, however, the most extensive and the most uniform of all the venous tissues. It is the only one which is found in the substance of organs, and is present where the cellular and proper membrane are want- ing. This is the case not only with venous branch- es and minute canals as they issue from the sub- stance of muscles, bones, and such organs as the

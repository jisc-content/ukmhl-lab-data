BRAIN. 363 tie below the lower margin of the valve seem to sink directly into the cerebellic substance, mutual- ly join, and form a whitish stem, which is rami- fied in the middle of the cerebellum. About four lines or half an inch from their first entrance into the organ, a branch set off almost straight up- wards is the vertical branch, (Der Stehende Ast,) which, after giving off its first twig (der erste zweig) to the central lobe, divides into other se- ven, which are distributed to the anterior or me- sial lobules of the quadrilateral lobes, as they meet on the mesial plane. The white stem of this vertical branch is thick and large. A more slender stem, the continuation of the original white band, proceeding horizontally back- wards towards the purse-shaped notch, is the ho- rizontal stem (Der liegende Ast,) which constitutes by ramification a number of important pai'ts on the mesial plane of the cerebellum. After giving three or four twigs generally small, and also ver- tical, to the last leaves of the quadrilateral lobes, the branches are parted in the following order:— 1st, A twig under the cross commissures of the posterior-upper lobes, forming the short exposed cross-bands (die Kurzen und sichtbaren Querban- der,) and the long covered cross-bands; (die ver- steckten und langen Querbander;)—2d, A branch dividing into three strong twigs, forming the leaves of \hepyramid;—3d, A long branch dividing into three twigs, forming the leaves of the uvula (der Zapfen ;)—4#/«, The last generally a single twig.

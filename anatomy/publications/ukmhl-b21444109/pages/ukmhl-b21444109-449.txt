BRAIN, 427 belong rather to the head of meningeal hemor- rhage, shall be noticed afterwards. The effects produced by capillary injection and hemorrhage in the spinal chord vary according to the stage of the process and the region of the chord in which it occurs. In the stage of injec- tion it produces irregular involuntary twitches of the muscles of the trunk and extremities, numb- ness and coldness of the skin about the back, and occasionally of the limbs, and more or less loss of muscular power. In the advanced stage, whether that of hemorrhage or of pulpy destruction, numb- ness and palsy of the paraplegic form are com- plete. In some instances the state of capillary injec- tion appears to give rise to tetanic symptoms. This fact, which was observed by Dr Robert Reid in Ireland,* Duchatelet, Martinet,! and Ollivier |: in France, and by Dr Duncan Junior, in the stage of suppuration,^ has led to the recent revival of an opinion originally proposed by Galen, and repro- duced in modern times by Fernel, Willis, and Hoffmann,—that tetanus depends on a morbid state * On the Nature and Treatment of Tetanus and Hydro- phobia.

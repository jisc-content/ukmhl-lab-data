BONE. 531 If a portion of bone be placed in a charcoal fire, and the heat be gradually raised to whiteness, it burns first with flame, and at length becomes quite red. If then it be removed carefully and slowly cooled, it appears as white as chalk, is found to be very brittle, and to have lost something of its weight. Yet neither in this case does any part of its substance appear to be removed, nor is its mechanical figure or appearance altered. Chemical examination, however, informs us that in the first case, a portion of earthy matter (phos- phate of lime) is removed by the agency of the acid, and held suspended in the fluid, while the pliant, but otherwise identical piece of bone con- sists chiefly, if not entirely, of animal matter; and that in the second case, this animal matter is re- moved by destructive decomposition, while the earthy matter is left little changed by the action of fire. It is therefore to be concluded, that every particle of bone, however minute, consists of ani- mal or organic, and earthy or inorganic matter intimately united ; and that it is impossible to touch with the point of the smallest needle any part of bone which is not thus constituted. A piece of bone consists not of cartilaginous fibres varnished over, as Herissant imagined, with ear- thy matter, but of a substance in which every con- stituent atom consists essentially of animal and earthy matter intimately combined. There is therefore no rational ground for divid- ing osseous tissue into compact and spongy, as the

So far as accurate observation hitherto goes, the genuine ulcer is found chiefly at the convolut- ed surface of the brain ; (Ridley, p. 212; Powell, case 6,) or the foliated surface of the cerebellum, (Haller, Tom. IV. p. 351,) and is always connected with an unsound state of the proper or vascvilar membrane. Of this sort of ulcer, StoU found an instance on the cerebellum of a young man of twen- ty-six, accompanied with redness, thickening, and erosion of the pia mater. * Two cases of the same nature are recorded by Scoutetten. In one, the lower part of the right anterior lobe presented a hard, dry, irregular surface, thirteen lines long and seven broad, with irregular indented edges, with the contiguous cerebral substance sound. In the other, the extremity of the posterior lobe presented two small ulcerated patches, one oval, six lines long, and covered with deep gray pulpy matter; the other a linear depression,—both with wine-lee colour of the adjacent brain. In both cases, the investing proper membrane was red, in- jected, and somewhat eroded, t From these facts, it results that ulceration of the brain is an effect of circumscribed inflammation of the pia mater. The instances of erosion, or ulceration from the • Ratio Medendi^ pars tertia, p. 122. t Memoire sur quelques cas rares d'Anatomie Pathologi- que du Cerveau, &c. Par Scoutetten, D. M. P. &c.

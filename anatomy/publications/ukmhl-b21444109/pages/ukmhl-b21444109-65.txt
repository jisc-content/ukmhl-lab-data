FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 45 blood is probably altered, but the capillaries of the tissue are much affected, certainly overloaded, pro- bably disorganized. Similar effusion is occasionally found in the fila- mentous tissue in malignant agues, remittents, especially those of tropical countries, and some- times in the fever of temperate regions. 5. Induration. UEndurcissement du Tissu Cel- lulaire of Andry, Auvity, &c. Scleroma of Chaus- sier, {(TH.Kri^u[jua aaXri^og.) Skin-bound of Underwood and Burns. Compact oedema of M. Leger and other French authors. First observed by John An- drew Uzembezius in 1718, this affection was not accurately described till 1780, when Denman and Underwood in England, and Doublet in France, published the result of their observations. In 1787 it was fully investigated by Andry, in a me- moir crowned by the prize of the Royal Society of Medicine of Paris ; and afterwards, in 1789, in those of Auvity and Hulme. Since this it has undergone the successive researches of Naudeau and Bard in France, Went, Henke, Golis, &c. in Germany, Liberali and Palletta in Italy, and again of Trocon, Leger, Denis, and Breschet in France. Notwithstanding the research of these several in- quirers, however, the nature of this change in the filamentous tissue is still imperfectly understood. It has hitherto been observed only in infants, and very often immediately after birth. Accord- ing to Leger, it appears most frequently eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours after, and very sel- dom takes place later than the seventh day. Ge-

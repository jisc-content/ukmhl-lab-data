GENERAL ANATOMY. 122! origin which is strictly susceptible of demonstra- tion is that of the red vein from the red artery. The point then to be ascertained is, whether colourless veins and absorbent veins arise from the several textures, as colourless and exhalant arteries terminate in them ? The proper place for the further examination of this question is the subsequent chapter. I must not omit to mention, nevertheless, that the veins have been shown to be connected at their ramified extremities with the lymphatics. When the veins become distinct vessels, branch- es, and trunks, they become once more objects of sensible examination. In their course or transit from their organic to their cardiac extremities they present various circumstances which merit attention. 1. In general every artery is accompanied by a ve- nous tube, which is divided in the same manner, and furnishes or receives an equal number of branches. Thus the descending aorta is accompanied by the vena cava inferior; the common iliac arteries by common iliac veins; the anterior iliac, femoral, and popliteal, by anterior iliac, femoral and popliteal veins. These veins are deep-seated, and are ge- nerally named the concomitant veins, vencs comites vel vencs satellites.) In some situations an artery may be accompanied either in its trunk or in its branches by two veins of equal size. Thus in general the brachial artery and its branches, the radial and ulnar, are each accompanied by two veins. The only situations in which the number

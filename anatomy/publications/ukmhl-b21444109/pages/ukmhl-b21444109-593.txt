Fuller ideas were given by Pandolphinus, who represents it as commencing in the texture of the bone, which first becoming corrupted, then af- fects the soft parts. By M. A. Severinus it is re- presented as an abscess in the substance of the bone near the joint, partly putrid, partly gangre- nous, but produced in the manner of the cold or congestive inflammation. * A still nearer approach to the true pathology of this malady was made by Friend, who placed the primary action in the marrow, which becom- ing diseased and enlarged, separates the outer lamella, and distends the periosteum with pain and swelling. Similar opinions appear to have been entertained by the first Monro, Cheselden, Amy and, Schlichtling, Cheston (p. 117,) Brom- field, who regards it as abscess of the marrow, (p. 20 and 22,) and Warner, who places it in the marrow and vessels of the bone, (p. 322.)

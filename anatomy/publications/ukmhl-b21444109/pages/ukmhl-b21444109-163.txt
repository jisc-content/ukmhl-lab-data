SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 141 minute or capillary terminations must have the same property. This conclusion is completely unfounded for two reasons. Isf, I have already shown that the proper arterial tunic is not mus- cular in structure, and, according to the best ex- periments, possesses no property of contraction when stimulated. 2d, Although it be admitted that the proper arterial tissue is muscular and ir- ritable, it is quite certain that observ^ation has not hitherto shown that this tunic can be recognized in arteries smaller than a line in diameter; and it is certain that in the capillaries, properly so call- ed, that is, in vessels which partake of the nature of artery and vein, no such structure has yet been observed. It is not improbable, however, that the capilla- ries possess certain organic or vital properties ; but all that has been taught on this subject is ei- ther hypothetical, or derived from an insufficient and imperfect collection of facts. It is certain that the blood which moves through them is be- yond the direct influence of the action of the heart, and can be affected by this only so far as it keeps the larger vessels constantly distended with a co- lumn of blood which cannot retrograde, and must therefore move forward in the only direction left to it. It has been therefore argued that the ca- pillaries must have an inherent power of contrac- tion by which this motion is favoured. Is it not sufficient to say that they act merely as resisting canals, to prevent their contents from escaping,

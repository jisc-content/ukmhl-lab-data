335 BRAIN. double semicircular chord {centrum semicircnlare geminum, Vieussens,) each optic eminence presents four free surfacesâ€”the upper, the inner, the poste- rior, and the lower. The upper, the first, is gently rounded and of white colour. Its figure and limits are not easily defined. The outer margin is bound- ed by the circular band, which even passes on an- terior to it, so as to form its boundary in that di- rection also. Behind, it is less distinctly limited, unless by the appearance of a considerable promi- nence, which has been generally named the poste- rior tubercle of the optic couch. Thie inner mar- gin of the upper surface is most distinctly marked by a small sharp gray line, which, beginning in- sensibly at the anterior part of the body, becomes more distinct as it extends backwards, and is ul- timately found to bend gently toward the median plane. There it unites with a similar elevated line of the opposite optic eminence ; and to the point of union is attached a small conical body with a minute point, of a gray colour, and of a shape like that of the pine-apple. This is the ob- ject improperly termed pineal gland {glandula pi- nealis, conarium; Die Zirbel-driise; Reil); and the minute linear eminences or tracts, which form the inner edge of the upper optic surface, have been named pedimcles of the pineal gland. The inner surface of the optic couch or chamber pre- sents nothing important, save the small portion of soft cerebral matter, which unites it to the si- milar surface of the opposite body. Its posterior

The third layer consists of a set of fibres which, issuing from the upper layer of the brain- limb at their entrance into the thalamus, are firmly tied as it were into a loop or knot, (der Schleife,) and are then expanded like a brush in^ to the substance of the thalamus. The lower is formed chiefly by the cerebral limb. It is partly in the former, partly in the latter, that the dark-co- loured matter constituting the locus niger is placed. The thalamus is so intimately connected with the limbs, that they must be viewed as essential parts of the same organized whole. The compo- nent rods or fibrous bands (seine Markstabchen) of the latter, partly combining with the former, but chiefly receiving them, spread out near the outer edge of the thalamus circularly, and consti- tute the radiated expansion called by Reil the StafFwreath. (Der Stab-Kranz.) These rods, at first obliquely horizontal, gradually, as they ex- pand, assume a more vertical direction. Inwards, or towards the mesial plane from the first band or rod ascends the anterior pillar of the Twainband (fornix) to the knobs of the beam. Then follow the first band or spoke of the wreath, and the rest in succession. The anterior rods are long, slen- der, numerous, and thickly crowded on each other. The middle or lateral are short, thick, roll-like, and form a sort of crest or comb. The posterior are long and of fibrous structure. As they expand they form nearly a complete circle, which radiates through all the lobes. The radii of this circle are connected in the anterior lobes with the knee of

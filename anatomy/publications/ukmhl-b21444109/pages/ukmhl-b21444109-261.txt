LYMPHATIC GLAND OR GANGLION. 239 ness. The thoracic duct was found filled with osse- ous matter by Poncy, and with earthy or osseous matter by Assalini. * Cheston found it obstruct- ed with a solid substance resembling calcareous matter ;f Bay ford found it much obstructed by the pressure of an aneurismal tumour; :j: and Scherl is said to have met with an actual concretion. ยง The lymphatics have been long supposed to be the agents concerned in the formation of king's evil, {struma, scrofula^ and in the developement of the disease when latent. What are the proofs of this opinion ? Have the lymphatics been ac- tually found disorganized in cases of strumous disease, and does scrofula never take place without traces of this disorganization ? Do they act as the cause, or do they partake in the effects of another morbific agent more general in operation ? In answering these questions much will depend upon the meaning attached to the term scrofula. If this be a disease appearing in the lymphatic glands only, there may be some ground for the opinion. But to assemble the numerous disorders termed strumous, under the head of the lympha- tics, implies conclusions which are not supported by anatomical facts. * Essai Medical sur les Vaisseaux Lymphatiques, &c.

474 GENERAL ANATOMY. debted to Soemmering, who showed by the colla- tion of numerous cases, that scarcely any person arrived at the age of puberty, though in the best health and the most perfect enjoyment of his fa- culties, could assure himself that his conarium did not contain calcai'eous matter. He regards it as part of the natural structure. Though Soemmering states that sabulous depo- sition is found in the conarium of infants as well as adults, he nowhere specifies the exact authority for this fact; and the youngest subjects on which he records its occurrence were 14 and 16.* The Wenzels assert that they have seen stony particles so early as the 7th year, and a substance very si- milar a few months after birth. | I am satisfied that I have seen in the pineal glands of young children, whose ages I could not ascertain, but who certainly did not exceed 9 or 10, small sabu- lous particles; but my personal observation does not enable me to say how far the statements of the Austrian anatomists as to earlier periods is correct. The conarium itself consists chiefly of firm red- dish gray cerebral matter, at the basis or posterior end of which are two whitish threads, which pro- ceed on each side to the optic thalamus, and form what are termed the peduncles of the gland, from which they are separated by a small linear de- pression. Behind the union of these peduncles, * S. T. Soemmering, de Acervulo Cerebri Dissert. Apud Ludwig. Scriptorum Neurolog. nunc Delect, p. 322, 329. f De Penitiori Structura Cerebri, pp. 155â€”157.

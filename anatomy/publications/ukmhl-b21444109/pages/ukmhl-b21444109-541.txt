WHITE FIBROUS SYSTEM. 519 tions are minute, irregularly spheroidal, and oc- cupy the substance of the membrane. Their pre- sence gives rise to chronic inflammation of the membrane, which becomes thick, spongy, and vas- cular, and is at length detached from the bone by effusion of purulent fluid ; and their liquefaction eventually forms a bad suppuration. This is one of the forms of what is usually termed strumous disease of the bones. 3. Chondroma.-—Cartilaginous induration of the white fibrous tissue is so common that it scarcely requires separate notice. The ligaments are often affected with this, especially in stiff and ankylosed joints, and appear then to acquire the properties of genuine cartilage. This, which may be regarded as one of the effects of chronic inflammation, with long disease of the articular tissues, I con- ceive, is what is meant by inordinate rigidity of the ligaments, much dwelt on by practical authors It never occurs, I am satisfied, unless under the circumstances now mentioned. In the periosteum I have seen the same change resulting from the same causes. It takes place after compound frac- tures, occasionally after amputation, and, in short, in all circumstances in which the membrane is in- flamed. 4 Ossification.—Partial or general conversion into bone, though not uncommon in the white fibrous system, is nevertheless restricted in a pecu- liar manner. It is, for instance, much less frequent in ligament than in periosteum ; and in fascia it is

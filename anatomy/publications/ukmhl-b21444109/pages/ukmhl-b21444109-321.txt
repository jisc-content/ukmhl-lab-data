The names of these it is superflu- ous to enumerate ; and to attempt to estimate their respective merits does not belong to the plan of the present treatise. It is sufficient to remark those circumstances only which bear directly on the subject of this chapter. Of all the works which have been composed on the anatomy of the brain, the subjects may be re- ferred to two general heads ;â€”those which treat of the configuration of the organ, and those which undertake to investigate its minute structure. The authors themselves, however, do not always distinguish accurately between these two depart- ments of anatomical science. As it is chiefly the latter which is to occupy attention at present, I may mention, that after the epistle of Varoli on the base of the brain and the origin of the optic nerves, the writings of Willis, Malpighi, and Vi- eussens, are the first which claim much notice. The works of Ridley, * and of Glaserus, t contain some good observations ; and that of Santorini :j: deserves to be mentioned for the first good de- scription of the optic thalamic Father Delia * Anatomy of the Brain.

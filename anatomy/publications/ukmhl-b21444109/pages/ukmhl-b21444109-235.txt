SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 213 are progressively shorter, and always with the ef- fect of increasing the enlargement. 3d, In all the cases in which the enlarged limb has been examined by dissection, the subcutaneous and intermuscular filamentous tissue is hardened, thickened, and condensed, and contains a quantity of granular matter, viscid and gelatinous in con- sistence, but like fat in appearance. This has not been analyzed ; but little doubt can be entertained that it contains a good proportion of albuminous matter. That this is the essential change, is established by the testimony of many observers. (Jaegerschmidt, Henseler, Kennedy, Graves, Hull.) The distension of the skin, the enlargement of its papillae, the slender blanched appearance of the muscles, and the enlargement of the inguinal glands, are effects only of the state of the subcu- taneous and intermuscular cellular tissue. In short, until new facts be adduced, the description given by Dr Graves, and the case of Mr Hull, establish the inference, that the elephantine en- largement of the extremities is the result of gela- tinous or albuminous exudation from the arteries of the subcutaneous filamentous tissue. 6. Accidental Developement or Morbid For- mation of the Exhalant System. In several in- stances a process of exhalation takes place in cer- tain textures in which it did not originally exist, at least under the same form ; or a process of ex- halation may go on without a corresponding one of removal by absorption. Of this anormal de-

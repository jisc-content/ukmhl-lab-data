24 GENERAL ANATOMY. CHAPTER II. FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. (Tela cellulosa,—Tissu cellulaire,—Tissu muqueiix of Bordeu.—Corpus crihrosum, Hippocratis,-— Corps crihleux of Fouquet,—Reticular Mem- brane of William Hunter.) Section I. The general distribution of the filamentous or cellular tissue was first maintained by Haller and Charles Augustus de Bergen, and afterwards made the subject of more elaborate discussion by Wil- liam Hunter and Bordeu. It may be described as a substance consisting of very minute thready lines, which follow no uniform or invariable direction, but which, when gently raised by the forceps, pre- sent the appearance of a confused and irregular net-work. As these minute lines cross each other, they form between them spaces of a figure not easily determined, and perhaps not uniform. By some authors these spaces or intervals have been named cells; but accurately speaking the term is not fortunately applied. The component lines, which do not exceed the size of the silk-worm threads, are so slender, that they do not form those distinct partitions which the term cell implies; and though by forcible distension, such as takes

GENERAL ANATOMY. 234 flamm, Johnstone, and Maanen, have ascribed to different forms and degrees of disorder of the lymphatic system a very large proportion of the diseases incident to the human body. All of these authors, nevertheless, have been exceeded by Soemmering, and more recently by Alard, both of whom represent the lymphatics as mainly con- cerned in every morbid state of the human body. The former has delineated an extensive picture of diseases, in the production of which the lymphatics are believed to be more or less concerned. Be- sides immediate morbid states of the lymphatics themselves, he enumerates upwards of sixty dis- eases and morbid states of the human body, in which, according to one or another pathologist, the lymphatics have an influence, direct or indirect, immediate or remote. The latter reasons most strenuously for the universal influence of the lym- phatic system in every disease almost of the ani- mal frame. Little doubt can be entertained, that by these authors the influence of the lymphatic vessels has been very much overrated. Notwithstanding the authority of their names, it is certain that neither anatomical inspection, nor the observation of the phenomena and effects of disease, justify the views advanced by these authors. It further requires little argument to show, that this mode of ex- plaining the formation and nature of diseases does not tend to the advancement of accurate patholo- gical knowledge.

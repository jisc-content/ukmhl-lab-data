• 18 GENERAL ANATOMY. with the cellular; the synovial should be viewed as a modification of the serous system ; the pilous and epidermal systems ought not to be separated from the cutaneous or dermal; and even this last, along with the glandular and mucous, ought to be referred to the same general head. According to these principles all the organized substances com- posing the human body are referred by Meckel to the following ten heads :— 1. Mucous, or cellular. 6. Fibro-cartilaginous. 2. Vascular. 7> Fibrous. 3. Nervous. 8. Muscular. 4. Osseous. 9. Serous. 5. Cartilaginous. 10. Cutaneous. Against this arrangement Mayer, professor of anatomy at Bonn, has urged the following objec- tions :—That it is impossible to consider the scarf- skin, or cuticle, and the hairs, as of the same or similar structure with the cutaneous tissue in ge- neral; that glandular structure cannot be regarded as pertaining to the same order with the mucous membranes; that the fibro-cartilages ought neither in this arrangement nor in that of Bichat to be con- sidered as distinct from cartilage; and that in both several parts of the animal body are omitted, or can have no convenient place of reference. Mayer therefore reduces the twenty-one tissues of Bichat to seven, and adds an eighth, comprehending the crystalline lens, the cornea, epidermis, hair, nails, &c, to which he gives the general name of lamel- lar tissue.

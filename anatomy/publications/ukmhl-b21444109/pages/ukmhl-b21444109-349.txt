BRAIN. 327 white colour. These two lines are the generating or initial filaments of the first pair of nerves. Within the perforated spot the curvilinear hol- low is generally conceived to be terminated. The unconvoluted space, however, in which it consists, is here directly continuous with the figurate sur- face of the brain. This space indeed makes here a sharp turn backwards; and having on the inside the long cerebral band termed the ojitic tract, may be conceived to be bounded by the limb of the brain. This body, with that of the opposite side, will be imperfectly seen at first; and though the end which unites each with the bridge or jirotu- berance is sufficiently conspicuous, the opposite ex- tremity cannot be distinctly perceived. It is in- deed covered by a portion of the convoluted sur- face, the inner and prominent surface of the me- dio-inferior or spheno-temporal region. This must therefore be gently moved outwards or la- terally, and also raised; and with the aid of the handle of a scalpel and the fingers of a dexterous assistant, the cerebral limb may be shown to be here crossed or surrounded by the optic tract of the side. The purpose of this part of the exposi- tion is to show the geniculate bodies, or posterior eminences of the optic chambers. But the attention of the demonstrator is to be directed to that part of the convoluted surface which covers the anterior end and outer margin of the cerebral limb, and which has been raised on the scalpel-handle. When gently everted, it is

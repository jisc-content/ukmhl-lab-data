ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 81 the ventricle along the margin of its orifice to the inside of the arterial tube. Exactly at the point of union it is doubled into three semicircular folds, forming semilunar valves, and thence is continued along the whole course of the artery. This mem- brane is entirely distinct from the proper or fibrous coat. Of the latter, the cardiac extremity or be- ginning is notched into three semicircular sec- tions, each of which corresponds to the base or attached margin of a semilunar valve. These sec- tions are attached to the aortic orifice of the ventricle by delicate filamentous tissue, but are not connected with the fleshy fibres of the heart; and at the angle or point of attachment, the thin inner membrane is folded in so as to fill up a space or interval which is left between the mar- gin of the orifice and the circumference of the pro- per arterial tissue, where it is notched or trisected. The aorta is soon divided into branches, which again are subdivided into small vessels. With the mathematical physiologists it was a favourite prob- lem to ascertain the number of branches into which any vessel might be subdivided. Keill made them from forty to fifty. Haller states, that, counting the minutest ramifications, he has found scarcely twenty. The inquiry is vain and useless, and cannot be subjected to accurate calculation. In no two subjects is the same artery found to be subdivided the same number of times ; and in no two subjects are the very same branches found to arise from the same trunk. F

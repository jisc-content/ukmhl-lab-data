221 SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. f]. Lipoma. This name was first applied by Littre to a wen or cyst filled with soft matter possessing the usual properties of animal fat. * The matter of steatom, according to this surgeon, is either not, or imperfectly inflammable, by reason of its degeneration or commixture with some other animal secretion. The propriety of this distinction has been denied by Louis and others, who maintain that these tumours differ in nothing, unless perhaps in degree. It has been favoured, nevertheless, by Morgagni, and adopted by Plenck, Desault, Bichat, and various foreign surgeons, and is defended by Boyer, who repre- sents the steatom as differing from lijioma, in the matter being white, firm, and changed from its original character, and in possessing the tendency to degenerate into cancer, f Plenck had previ- ously distinguished the lipoma, by being destitute of cyst, a circumstance not required by Littre. Though thus admitted to differ, the anatomical character, as given by Morgagni, t and confirmed by Boyer, is in both nearly the same. A cyst containing unchanged fat, or granular adipose matter, in cells formed by the original fibres of the adipose membrane, according to Morgagni, or those of the filamentous tissue, according to Boyer.

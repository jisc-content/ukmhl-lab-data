BRAIN. 399 This is the simplest and mildest form of the apo- plectic seizure. (Cataphora.) It has been thought that this could not happen unless blood is effused ; but various instances have occurred to competent observers in which the ce- rebral vessels were loaded only, and in which ef- fusion had not yet taken place. It may further be inferred, that the instances in which persons recover from complete apoplectic seizure without suffering palsy depend upon vascular injection only. That fatal cases even may result from mere accu- mulation, is admitted by Morgagni, * afterwards by Baillie, t without being aware that the obser- vation had been made, and by Rochoux, who thinks, however, that it is not uniform. :|: I ob- serve, nevertheless, that M. Rochoux forgets that the cases in which it occurs being less frequently fatal, are more rarely the subject of inspection. According to M. Serres, indeed, cases of apo- plectic seizure without palsy depend on injection * Epist. iii. 25 and 26. + " The milder forms of apoplexy depend upon a disten- tion of some of the vessels of the brain from undue accu- mulation of blood in them. I have known, however, one instance of fatal apoplexy, where many of the blood-vessels were found, upon examination after death, to be much dis- tended with blood; but no blood had been extravasated in any part of the brain."â€”Lectures and Observations on Me- dicine.

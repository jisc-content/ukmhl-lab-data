SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. 805 The jjresence of synovial membrane in the arti- cular cartilage is nevertheless established by sun- dry facts. 1*/, If a portion of articular cartilage be divided obliquely, and examined by a good glass, it is not difficult to recognize at one extre- mity of the section a thin pellicle, differing wide- ly in aspect, colour, and structure, from the blu- ish-white appearance of the cartilage, ^d. If the free surface of the cartilage be scraped gently, it is possible to detach thin shavings, which are also distinct from cartilage in their appearance. 2d, The free surface of the cartilage is totally differ- ent from the attached surface, or from a section of its substance, and derives its peculiar smooth polished appearance from a very thin transparent pellicle uniformly spread over it. Mh, If articu- lar cartilage be immersed in boiling water, this thin pellicle becomes opaque, while the cartilage is little changed. 5tJi, Immersion in nitric or mu- riatic acid, which detaches the cartilage from the bone, gives this surface a cracked appearance, which is not seen in the attached surface, and which is probably to be ascribed to irregular con- traction of two different animal substances. Qth, The existence of this cartilaginous synovial mem- brane is demonstrated by the morbid process with which the tissue is liable to be affected. Upon the whole, therefore, I believe little doubt can be entertained, that the representation of their course, as given originally by Nesbitt, Bonn, and Hunter, is well founded 4

BBAIN. 367 stance be from the white, no diiference in minute structure can be recognized by the most powerful lens. Each appears to consist of an infinite mul- titude of globules, connected by a peculiar, elastic band ; and he observes that this cerebral globule does not float in a fluid as Delia Torre imagined, but is connected to the contiguous ones by a thin and transparent cellular web, (tela cellulosa sub- tilissima et pellucidissima,) which is a series of membranous partitions derived from the soft membrane and minute vessels. This last conclu- sion is not quite certain, and would require to be made the subject of further researches. * On the structure of these globules nothing is known with certainty. They are not exactly spherical, but are said to be irregularly round. The observation of Delia Torre, that they are largest in the convoluted brain, (cerebrum,) smal- ler in the laminated, (^cerebellum,) and most mi- nute in the vertebral portion, is fanciful, and per- haps unfounded. Prochaska, however, admits that the globules are not all of the same size, but that it is impossible to ascribe their variable mag- nitude to a regular principle, unless the proximity or remoteness of the lens. * The accuracy of these observations is confirmed in general by the testimony of Soemmering, whose inferences, derived from the observations of Lewenhoek, Delia Torre, Malacarne, Metzger, * Georgii Prochaska De Structura Nervorum, &c.

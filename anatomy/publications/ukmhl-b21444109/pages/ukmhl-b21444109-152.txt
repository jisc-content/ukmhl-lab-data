GENERAL ANATOMY. 130 have represented generally to succeed violence of- fered to the vessel; but what sort of violence is requisite is not well known. I have in two or three instances thought I could trace it to wound, laceration, or pressure in the site of a valve ; but in others this could not be established. This process is known to take place sponta- neously in the veins of the brain and in those of the womb. The latter Dr Clarke * and Mr Wil- son f found filled with purulent matter or lymph in the persons of females cut off by puerperal fe- ver ; and in two fatal cases of the same disease I saw these veins containing purulent fluid. The venous tubes of the brain have been found pre- senting marks of inflammation by Dr Abercromby | and M. Gendrin. ยง It appears, therefore, that inflammation of the inner venous coat rarely terminates in albuminous exudation and adhesion ; and it may be stated as a peculiar character of this tissue, as distinct from the inner arterial membrane, that, while the lat- ter is almost sure to assume the adhesive, the for- mer is exceedingly prone to the suppurative form of inflammation. 3. Instances, nevertheless, have occurred in which inflammation of this membrane was followed by * Practical Essays on the Management of Pregnancy, p. 63, 72. f Transactions of a Society, Vol. III. p. 63, and p.

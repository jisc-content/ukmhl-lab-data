SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 147 the different tissues. But although much has been lately done by Wilson Philip, Hastings, and others, to determine this point, it is still beset with some difficulties and objections, and would perhaps re- quire some variation in the experiments, in order to place the subject in the clearest light. This hypothesis first originated with Vacca Berling- hieri, and was supported in this country by Lub- bock, Allen, Reeve, Wilson Philip, and recently by Hastings and Black. Upon the whole, two facts may be considered to be established regarding the state of the capil- lary vessels of an inflamed part. The first is, that these vessels are unnaturally and unusually distended, and really contain more blood than in the state of health. This is proved not only by incisions into inflamed parts, but by dissections of every part and organ of the body. The second is, that the blood moves more slowly in these vessels than in the healthy state, and even after some time may remain entirely motionless. This is also established by observing the effects of inflamma- tion in the human body, but especially by the phe- nomena of inflammation excited artificially in the bodies of the lower animals. It is still a point to be ascertained, whether these two conditions constitute what may be term- ed the essence of inflammation ; and it is still un- determined by what agency these states are indu- ced in the capillary system of any tissue or organ. On this head it may be remarked, that, if by any

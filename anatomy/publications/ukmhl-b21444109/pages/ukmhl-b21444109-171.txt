SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 149 Far6, Phioravant, &c.); the balsam of Nature, or agglutinative halsam of Wiseman, * the gluten of Sauvages, Gaubius, and Cullen, the coagulating or organi%ahle lymph of Hunter, and the glutinous or albuminous exudation of the French pathologists According to the observations of Hunter, Bail- lie, and Home, this lymph is afterwards penetrat- ed with minute arteries and veins, or acquires a capillary system of its own; and in this state it is properly organi%ed lymph. This process of for- mation of new capillaries occurs in every situation in which lymph is deposited; \st. In the exudation of inflamed serous membranes, which afterwards forms the membrane of adhesions; 2^/, In wounds of skin, cellular membrane, mucous membrane, mus- cle, &c.; In inflammation of these tissues, * " But in regard there is a certain medium which answers in proportion to a glue, required in this work, Nature taketh what is next in hand, even the nourishment of the part which is hurt to make it of. IJhi morhus ibi remedium is here as an oracle ; where the disease is, there is the remedy. No sooner is the wound made but the balsam is discovered. Blood, at least the serous part of it, is the glue, which she useth both in curing by the first and second intention. The first being performed ^er si/mphysin, i. e. a reunion of the parts without any medium, by which word I here mean any callus or flesh, or other body interposed; for in another sense the balsam of Nature is the medium, the instrument of unity, and puts the parts together; the second j)^^' syssarcosin, i. e. with a me- dium or interposition of some flesh or callous substance, that fills up the space between the lips of the wound."â€”Chirur- gical Treatises by Richard Wiseman, Sergeant-Surgeon, Book V.

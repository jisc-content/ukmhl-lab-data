LYMPHATIC GLAND OK ftANGLION. 247 the discharge of foul, dirty-coloured fluid, has been generally ascribed to the absorption of the pestilential poison, and its direct operation on the glandular system. This is probably in general the true account of the pestilential bubo. As, however, they are almost invariably accompanied with carbuncles, it is not unlikely that in some instances the bubo may be the result of irritation from the presence of a carbuncle. â€¢ 3. Enlargement with Heath of the Glandular Tissue, OL. Strumous Mortified Bubo. Of stru- mous bubo there are many varieties well known to the practical surgeon. To this head, however, I refer a peculiar disease which I have seen in the glands at the bend of the arm. The glands become enlarged, painful, and hard; and, notwithstanding all efforts to procure resolution, the skin first gives way, chiefly by sloughing, and matter with some membranous shreds is discharged. A sore of a peculiar character is formed. Its edges consist of skin cut very sharp, and notched or serrated, as it were, into angular slips. From these margins the sore descends deep and rather foul to an ash-co- loured, solid, eonvexly-rounded body, which is evi- dently a diseased gland.

This process is attended with pain at first in the skin chiefly, but afterwards it seems to cause no

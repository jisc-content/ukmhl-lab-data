662 GENERAL ANATOMY. surfaces at which they are in the form of consi- derable trunks. Having penetrated the serous membranes, they divide in the subserous cellular tissue into branches, the size of which is consider- able, and here they form those numerous anasto- motic communications which constitute the arches so distinctly seen in the ileum. From the con- vexity of these arches in general are sent off the small vessels, which are then fitted, after passing through the muscular layer and the submucous tissue, to enter the mucous corion. The capillary terminations, then, of these arte- ries, and their corresponding veins, constitute the physical cause of the coloration of the mucous membranes. This coloration, however, is not at all times of the same intensity in the same mem- brane, and varies chiefly according to the state of the organ which the membrane covers. The co- loration of the gastro-enteric mucous membrane undergoes even within the limits of health many variations. Thus, according to the absence or presence of such foreign substances as are taken at meals, the mucous membrane is pale, or pre- sents various shades of redness. At the period of menstruation the uterine mucous membrane be- comes red and injected. Pressure on any of the venous vessels renders the mucous membrane blue, purple, or livid, as is seen in prolapsus, and more distinctly in asphyxia, in which all the mucous membranes assume a livid tint.

Chronic pleurisy ^empyema) is remarkable for the eiFects which it produces. First, the great accumulation of fluid forces the lung towards the mediastinum and spine, and com- presses it into so small bulk that it appears to be destroyed. Inspection shows, however, that it is merely compressed. Its vessels are crushed together; its bronchial tubes and ve- sicles closed; and the whole organ is rendered unfit for re- spiration. This is the condition mentioned by Broussais un- der the name of atrophied lung. * Second, suppurative de- struction may take place in the pulmonic pleura and corre- sponding part of the lung, and lay open one or more bron- chial tubes, causing pulmonary Jihlula and pneumothorax. Sero-purulent or purulent fluid is then discharged by cough- ing in a forcible and continuous stream. Of this kind are many cases of pulmonary abscess reported to be cured. Thirdly, suppurative destruction may take place in one or more points of the costal pleura, and discharge a consider- able quantity of puriform fluid through openings between the ribs, which are occasionally carious, t When these two modes of opening are combined, pneumothorax and emphy- sema take place. % Fourthly, The inordinate accumulation of fluid in the left sac of the pleura may be so great as to โข Phlegmasies Clironiques, Cases 19, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 324 sure. * This denomination does not accurately express the idea intended ; nor does the idea it- self, it may be remarked, present a correct view of the natural arrangement. The conformation which I have attempted to describe does not form a fissure, but a regular symmetrical opening, by which the convoluted surface communicates dis- tinctly and directly with that which is figurate. The next step of the process in the further ex- position of this opening or communication, re- quires the inversion of the brain, and the exposi- tion of the inferior regions of the convoluted sur- face,—the base of the brain. We have seen the manner in which the convoluted passes into the figurate surface, above and behind the middle band. At the inferior regions this transition is effected in a mode somewhat different;—and the channel or means by which it is made is the cur- vilinear hollow. To understand clearly the rela- tions by which this is established, the demonstra- tor should remove in small portions the mem- brane which covers the optic commissure and tracts, the pituitary peduncle, the pisiform emi- nences, and which binds together the adjoining convolutions, and especially those which are con- nected by it to the limbs of the brain, f When the convolutions are thus exposed, the furrows on * Anat.

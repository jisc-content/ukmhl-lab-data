These qualities are ascribed by Reil to a thin membranous pellicle, which he terms Epithelion, and with which he conceives the proper matter of the brain is covered. * Trusting to ordinary inspection, aided by a good glass, I do not think there is any sensible proof of the existence of this covering. It is more natural to regard it as cerebral matter modified for its si- tuation. In point of fact, the deep cerebral mat- ter may be rendered equally firm with this by im- mersion in alcohol or dilute acids. But nothing can give the smooth, polished, close-grained sur- face which belongs to every spot of this part of the brain. After this explanation, I shall not scruple to use the term Epiihelion, not in the sense given by Reil, but merely as a name to the firm smooth substance which forms the figurate surface of the brain. In certain situations this surface is unusually firm, for instance in the narrow winding hollow between the striated bodies and the optic eminences. (Centrum semicirculare geminum, Vieussens ; tce- nia semicircularis, Haller.) Of the central sur- face not only does every division mutually com- municate, but the whole central surface of the con- voluted brain communicates with the central sur- * Archiv. fiir die Physiologic, gter Band, 3.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 328 found to present the thin white body named the tape or fringe (tcenia) of the hippocampus ; and if the portion of convoluted brain most anterior or next to the curvihnear hollow be raised and evert- ed in the same manner, the anterior end of this object termed the Jbot (pes hippocampi J will come into view. If this operation be properly perform- ed, no part will be torn, broken, or displaced; the objects exhibited are free surfaces, not adhering to each other but only in apposition. The white plate or tape of the hippocampus forms, in the natural position of the organ, the outer and lower border of the opening, while the limb of the brain, and after that the outer and lower surface of the optic chamber, forms its inner border. To obtain an idea yet more clear and distinct of this communication between the convoluted and figurate surfaces of the brain, it is convenient to follow the direction of the opening with the scal- pel handle backwards and upwards, until it reach the upper margin of the brain-limb, where it is shown to be merely a continuation of the lateral part of the posterior opening. This step of the exposition requires cautious and gentle manage- ment ; and the peculiar curvature which the parts forming the outer border of the communication follow, renders it difficult to avoid laceration or displacement. In general, it is best accomplished on a single hemisphere, from which the cerebel- lum has been previously removed; but it is de- sirable to preserve also the whole of the central

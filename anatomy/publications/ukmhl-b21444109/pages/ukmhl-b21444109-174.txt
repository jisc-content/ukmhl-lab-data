152 GENERAr, ANATOMY. these are, to the basis of tlie granulations, from thence toward their external surface, in pretty regular parallel lines, and woidd almost appear to terminate there." * At the same time the forma- tion or secretion of purulent fluid goes on ; and the sm'faces of these bodies themselves acquire the same power of preparing this fluid which the surface from which the granulations were pro- duced, possessed. In this instance we have an example of capillary vessels performing at the same time the effusion of lymph and the secretion of purulent fluid. In this stage of the process of granulation Mr Himter has remarked the disposition to union, cohesion, or adhesion, Avhicli granulating emi- nences possess, and described the mechanism by which this is accomplished. By many it might be deemed a distinct process. But in so far as the capillaries are concerned, the chief object of consideration at present, it is to be A iewed as a part of the second stage. The vessels of the granulating eminences continue to secrete lymph, which imites the corresponding sui'faces of their new bodies till their capillaries pass into each other, so as to inosculate, and the imion is completed. c. The third stage in the process of granula- tion consists in what he has termed contractmi. In describing this important part I fear he has committed two errors,â€”one in looking at the whole granulating siu-face and contiguous parts, * II. p. 477.

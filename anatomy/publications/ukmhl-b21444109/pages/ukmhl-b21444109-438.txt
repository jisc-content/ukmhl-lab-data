416 GENERAL ANATOMY, nier and Serres, though two are between 30 and 35, the great part are between 60 and 75. The state of the cerebral circulation now de- scribed is understood to depend exclusively on the vessels of that organ, and to constitute, therefore, primary apoplexy. The same state, or a near ap- proach to it, may take place secondarily in at least two different states of the system ; first, as a consequence of injuries of the head ; and, second- ly, in the course of fever intermittent, remittent, or continuous. The first shall be considered af- terwards. The second, or the febrile apoplexy, belongs to this place. The best example of this occurs in certain forms of ague, accompanied with marks of great accumu- lation in the head. It takes place chiefly at the termination of the cold stage, and the commence- ment, or in the course of the hot. In a slight de- gree the paroxysm is attended with drowsiness or lethargy, from which the patient may still be roused. Wheii this recurs once or twice, the in- sensibility is more complete till the phenomena of perfect apoplexy are induced. In other instances after dull heavy pain of the head, dizziness, im- paired vision, and some affection of the lu'inary secretion, the individual falls down suddenly with the mouth open, the eyelids fluttering, and other marks of relaxed muscles ; and continues during the rest of the paroxysm in a stertorous sleep. This may cease spontaneously, or terminate in death, unless the paroxysm, which is generally

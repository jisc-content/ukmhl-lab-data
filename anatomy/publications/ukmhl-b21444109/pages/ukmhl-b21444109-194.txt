172 GENEHAL ANATOMY. contributes powerfully to the bad symptoms and the unfavourable termination of the disease. In such a state of the organs of respiration the bron- chial arteries are less able to counteract the bad effects of imperfectly respired blood, in so far as they receive from the aorta blood which has not been sufficiently arterialized. y. In the capillary system of the cliylopoietic and assistant chylopoietic viscera traces of the same condition may be recognized, both from the symp- toms during life and the appearances after death. In these organs two capillary systems may be dis- tingviished, a primary and a secondary one. The primary is that which consists of the ultimate di- visions of the splenic, gastric, and duodenal arte- ries, and of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, and their corresponding veins, which afterwards terminate in the splenic and superior and inferior mesenteric veins. The secondary ca- pillary system is that which results from the union of the minute exti'emities of the portal vein, and of the hepatic artery with those of the vence cava hepaticcs. It is vmnecessary to dwell on the proofs of the loaded state of the capillary system of the alimen- tary canal. It is sufficient to remind the student that the furred or brown tongue, the thirst, the sense of internal heat, the loathing, squeamishness, and sometimes sickness, with Aveight, oppression, and tenderness of the ejHgastric region, sufficiently demonstrate the morbid state of the capillaries of

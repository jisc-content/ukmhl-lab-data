358 GENERAI- ANATOMY, the beam, cross the Jhssa Sylvii near the anterior and posterior cornua to the outer edge of the thalamus, and terminate in the lateral cornu in the apex of the middle lobe, at the beginning of the Sylvian fun-ow. In this course the anterior rays of the StafFwreath are longer than the middle and lateral rays, the interruption of which forms the comb or crest. (Der Kamm.) The posterior, which go to the border of the outer wall of the capsule, are the longest; and shorter ones are again seen below in the region of the lateral cornu. The last part, the organization of which can be here made the subject of short consideration, is the striated body. When observed, this part pre- sents a singular arrangement of white and gray matter in the form of alternate streaks. This ar- rangement, though constant, it is unnecessary to describe minutely, unless so far as it is connected with the appearances already mentioned. The parts which chiefly claim attention on this head are the cerebral nucleus, its capsule, and the ivalls of the capsule. The striated part of the brain may be regarded as a micleus, (Der Kern) or organized central mass,* which is contained within a capsule con- sisting of three walls or enclosing plates of white matter ; a lower, an outer, and an inner wall. The lower Avail of the capsule, which is acci- * Reil considers it a ganglion, (Das Gestreifte grosse Hirn- ganglium.) But this idea is hypothetical; and wliile I use the term nucleus, I wish to convey no idea but that of one part contained within another.

376 GENERAL ANATOMY, stands it. The centre is not in this case the figu- rate surface of the brain, but the centre of the op- tic and striated bodies which is first deposited, and from which the process of deposition advances to both surfaces at the same time, and nearly at equal rates. These inferences are established by the phenomena observed in the developement of the organ in the young of mammiferous animals in general. Section II. Cerebral substance is liable to inflammation, acute and chronic, to hemorrhage, to effusions of serous fluid, to alterations in its natural consist- ence, and to tumours. 1. Encephalia Acuta; Encephalitis. (Frank, Costantin.) Acute inflammation of the brain is a rare disease, and, perhaps, if always care- fully investigated, would be found never to take place spontaneously or primarily. As the ef- fect of accidental violence, and the result of morbid poisons, it is much more frequent; and it is chiefly under such circumstances that its phenomena and effects are known. (Pott, Dease, Hill, Malacarne, Desault, J. Bell, M. A. Petit, O'Halloran, Abernethy.) As the effect of me- chanical injury, the disease is found to be gene- rally circumscribed. Part of the brain becomes very vascular, acquires a red colour of various shades of intensity, and eventually becomes brown- ish or green, and much softer than natural. The

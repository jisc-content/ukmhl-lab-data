563 BONE. any bone of the skeleton, it most frequently ap- pears on the inner side of the thigh bone above the internal condyle, or vipon the shaft, which it may enclose completely, (Houstet;) next upon the tibia, which, with the fibula, it may encompass more or less perfectly; next upon the humerus, (J. Bell and Cooper;) next in the bones of the pelvis, (Cheston and Sandifort;) and finally, on such bones as the lower jaw, the temporal, and other bones of the cranium. It is most likely to take place at mus- cular or tendinous insertions.* In these forms of osseous deposition the vitality of the new deposit is small. Its organization is indistinct and imperfect; and in no long time it proceeds, apparently by pressure, to destroy the structure of the adjoining bone, which then be- comes rough, yellowish, or even black, and under- goes absorption. The bony mass at the same time is changed interiorly, presenting cavities contain- ing gelatinous or sanious fluid. The adjoining- soft parts are generally destroyed by pressure; and when they give way are wasted by bad, but not cancerous ulceration. The bone thus exposed is generally black, rough, and carious. Though no exact analysis of these osseous tumours has yet been made, it is known that they consist of phosphate of lime with animal matter. The bony tumours occurring in the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones, as described * On Exostosis, by Sir A. Cooper in Surgical EssaySj Part i. London, 1818, p. L55.

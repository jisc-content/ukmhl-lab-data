222 GliNERAL ANATOMY. the base or stalk in the case of pendulous stea- toms, the cells are compressed, but loose in the body of the tumour. This description, with the alleged cancerous tendency, accords more with the characters of the adipose sarcoma than those of the genuine wen. Personal examination enables me to say, that, in the case of small steatoms of the scalp, eyelids, face, &c. no fibres of this kind are recog- nized ; and to such, if any distinction be adopted, the name of lipoma should be confined. In the case of such larger steatoms as I have seen in other regions of the body, though the contents are firm- ly connected together, and some filamentous threads may be seen here and there, or the tumour may be even separable into masses, I have not been able to trace the distinct arrangement of cells mentioned by Morgagni and Boyer. Weidmann mentions, that in one case the matter of steatom was a sort of liquefied fat, and in another firm and dense, and not divided into lobes or cells. (H.) &. Lupia. This term, which has been often ap- plied generally to wens, {loupes,) is used in a more limited sense by Plenck, to designate a cyst con- taining a spongy substance in the cellular tissue, of which it is conceived to be a degenerate form. It is convenient as a head to which certain rare and anomalous cystic tumours may be referred. I. Melanoma. In many instances the melanotic matter, already mentioned, is deposited in a cyst. In such circumstances, therefore, it is referable to this head.

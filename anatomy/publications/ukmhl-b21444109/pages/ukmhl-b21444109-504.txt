482 GENERAL ANATOMY. to derange the capillary circulation of the brain and its membranes. In the former they induce not only a general injection of the cerebral capil- laries, but a local action in the immediate confines of the tumour, and pulpy destruction of the cere- bral substance. It often happens also that the whole organ is, in consequence of the capillary in- jection, infiltrated by pale or bloody serous fluid. In the membranes these tumours also induce injec- tion, terminating in infiltration of the subarach- noid tissue, and elFusion from the choroid web in- to the ventricles. The effects on the cerebral functions are then precisely similar to those which result from derangement of the capillary circula- tion taking place primarily. If local and intermit- tent, that is, recurring on the operation of certain causes, it induces chronic headach, with epileptic attacks. When the vascular orgasm becomes more general and constant, loss of memory, and some- times of judgment, irregular contractions of the members, and more or less palsy, are the conse- quences. As it advances to pulpy destruction, the involuntary contractions of the muscles are followed by palsy ; the abolition of sensation, re- collection, and intellect, give rise to fatuity; and life may be terminated either by coma, with or without convulsion, or by a sudden apoplectic at- tack. 2. Most of these organic changes, if small or li- mited in extent, exercise little influence on the functions ascribed to the brain. Even when large

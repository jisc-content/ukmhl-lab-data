261 NERVOUS TISSUE. cylindrical membranous tube, giving from its in- ner surface many productions forming smaller tubes (Canaliculi, Die Nervenrohre ; primitive cylinders of Fontana ;*) in which the proper ner- vous matter is contained. Of this arrangement the consequence is, tliat each nerve or nervous trunk, enveloped in its ge- neral neurilema, is comjjosed, nevertheless, of a number more or less considerable of smaller chord- like nervous threads (funiculi nervei, Pi'ochaska; chordce, flines, Nervenstraenge, Reil,) into which the nerve, by maceration and suitable preparation, may be resolved. Each chord, again, or nerve- string, as Reil terms it, though invested with a proper neurilem, may be further resolved into an infinite number of minute filiform or capillary fila- ments, {Fila,Jihrillce, Nervenfasern, Reil,) which, invested in a delicate covering, are understood to constitute the ultimate texture of the nerve. This threefold division may be easily observed in the brachial and spiral nerves of the arm, and still more distinctly in the sciatic in the thigh. The utility of understanding the internal ar- rangement from which it results will appear forth- with, when the structure of those parts termed ganglions and plexuses comes under examination. Of this arrangement in different nerves, and in different regions, this membrane undergoes great modification; and all opinions on its nature deriv- ed from thickness or transparency are liable to * Observations sur la structure des Nerfs, &c. apiid Traite sur le Venin, &c. par M.

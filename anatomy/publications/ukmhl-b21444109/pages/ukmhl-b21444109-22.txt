This division, which was made at a time when the attention of physicians was more attracted by physical and mathematical, than by physiological and vital properties, may now be safely set aside, while we adopt another which, though less scholastic, is more suited to the nature of living bodies. In the living body, it may be observed, there is no solid which is not alive, and which does not possess vital properties ; and there is no vital solid which does not possess all the properties ascribed to the simple solid, or the usual attributes of in- animate matter. The great characteristic of liv- ing or organic bodies is, that every substance which enters into their composition possesses not only the usual properties of matter, as weight, cohe- sion, flexibility, elasticity, &c. but also peculiar properties not found in inorganic bodies, and which have therefore been termed indiscriminately ani- mal or living' properties.

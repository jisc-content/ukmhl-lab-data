GENERAL ANATOMY. 10 systematic and connected view which Andrew Bonn of Amsterdam deUneated of the mutual connections of the membranes of the human body. In his Inaugural Dissertation, De Contimiationi- hus Membranarum, published at Leyden in 1763, this author, after some preliminary observations on membranes in general, and on their struc- ture and organization, unfolds the structure of the skin and its component parts, as ascertained by the best anatomists. He then proceeds to trace its continuation or transition into the mucous membranes, which he regards as productions of the skin ; 1st, By the eye-lids into the lacrymal passages; ^d. Into the external ear-hole; Sd, Into the nasal passages in the form of the Schneide- rian, or pitviitary membrane; ^th. Into the mouth, throat, and Eustachian tube and tympanal cavity; 5th, By the larynx and windpipe into the bron- chial tubes and lungs ; Qth, By the pharynx and oesophagus into the stomach and bowels, where, at the lower extremity of the rectum, its continui- ty with the skin may again be traced. He con- cludes this part of his essay with a short view of the transition of the skin into the mucous mem- brane of the urinary and genital organs, or what has since been named the genito-urinary surface. This may be regarded as the first division of his subject. In the second, in which he treats of the mem- branes beneath the skin, he considers, \st, Those of the muscles, as the cellular membrane and apo-

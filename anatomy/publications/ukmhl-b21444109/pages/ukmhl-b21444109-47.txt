riLAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 27 stood, as is probably the truth, to be effected by both. It is sufficient to remark, that, whatever serous fluid is secreted into the interstitial spaces or cells of the filamentous tissue, makes no long- abode in that situation, but in the healthy state is speedily i-emoved ; so that if we suppose exhala- tion, absorption must be also admitted ; and the filamentous tissue is therefore represented as the seat of an incessant exhalation and absorption. The serous fluid of the filamentous tissue varies in quantity in different regions. In the cellular tissue of those parts which are free from fat, as in the eyelids, the prepuce, the nymphcc and labia, and the scrotum, it is said to be somewhat more abundant than in others. The peculiar structure of those parts, which is cellular, may render any excess of serous fluid more conspicuous ; for it is matter of observation, that in many persons other- wise healthy these parts are not unfrequently dis- tended with serous fluid. On the other hand, it must be remarked that the submucous cellular tis- sue, and that which surrounds arteries, veins, and excreting ducts, which is delicate in substance and compact in structure, contains but a small propor- tion of serous fluid, and does not readily admit its presence. This fluid has been generally said to be of an albuminous nature ; and if it be identical with the serum of the blood, from which it is believed to be secreted, this character is not unjustly given it. Bichat, who maintained this opinion, injected al-

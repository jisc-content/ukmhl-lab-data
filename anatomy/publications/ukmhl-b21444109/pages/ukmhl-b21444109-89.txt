It is also found in the sub- stance of the marrow of bones; and perhaps in most cases in which the osseous system appears to be stained with the melanose deposite, the dark matter may be traced to the medullary particles, the situation of which it is found accurately to oc- cupy. In all these situations it appears in various de- grees of perfection, and in different forms. It may be disseminated in black or inky spots through the adipose membrane; it may be accumulated in spherical or spheroidal masses of various size and shape ; or it may be found in the form of brown or ebon-coloured fluid or semifluid, enclosed in a cyst formed of the contiguous tissue more or less condensed.

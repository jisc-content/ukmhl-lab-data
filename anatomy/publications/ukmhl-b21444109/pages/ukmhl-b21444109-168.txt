GENERAL ANATOMY. 146 increased velocity of circulation, various argu- ments may be urged ; and several of these depend on the circumstance, that this hypothesis also has been assumed on very insufficient grounds. 1*/, The increased number of the arterial pidse does not demonstrate that the blood is moving more ra- pidly than in the ordinary circumstances of health. It merely shows that the heart contracts more fre- quently in a given time than usual. 2d, The increas- ed number, or strength, or tension of the arterial pulse does not indicatethat the blood is movingwith greater force, or that the arteries through which it is moving are acting with greater power, but rather that the heart is contracting much more frequently, in order to overcome some obstacle. 3d, It does not appear that the increased number or force of the pulse, as manifested by the contrac- tions of the heart, depends on any other cause than the vital irritation occasioned by a local sti- mulus of a morbid nature. 4^//, The throbbing of inflamed parts proves nothing more, than that the shock communicated from the heart along the arterial tubes is rendered more sensible, first, by their dilated and distended condition ; and, second- ly, by the greater quantity of matter deposited in and around these vessels. (Parry.) The second doctrine, that the distended or di- lated state of the capillaries is to be ascribed to weakness or debility in their coats, appears to be more consonant with the usual phenomena of the process, aud with the effects which it produces in

The peculiar arrangement of vessels constitut- ing the erectile tissue was very nearly anticipated by our countryman William Cowper, who states, that he demonstrated the direct communication of arterial and venous canals, not only in the lungs, but in the spleen and penis, " in which," says he, " I have found these communications more open than in other parts." * In the tissue now described it is manifest that the physiologist ought to place the phenomena of the process distinguished by the name of vital turgescence (turgor vitalls) by Hebenstreit, f Reil, X Ackermann, \ and Schlosser. || Though these authors svippose vital turgescence in differ- ent degrees in almost all the textures of the ani- mal body, their most distinct examples are taken from those parts which consist of erectile vessels. After the explanation of the anatomical structure above given, it is superfluous to seek for any other * Philosophical Transactions, No. 285, p. 1386. t Brevis Expositio Doctrinae Physiologicse de Tiirgore Vitali. 1795.

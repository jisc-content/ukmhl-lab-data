158 GENERAL ANATOMY. remark, that purulent matter is prepared by many other tissues which contain no adipose matter; for instance the mucous and serous membranes, and several of the glandular organs, internal and ex- ternal. The fallacy of the opinion of Cullen, which was derived from the experiments of Pringle and of Gaber, has been already noticed. The view of Hunter is, on the whole, more cor- rect. In inflammation of the filamentous tissue, where the parts, or more accurately the vessels, lose the power of resolution, they begin to " alter their mode of action, and continue changing till they gradually form themselves to that state which fits them" to prepare purulent matter. This ap- plies, however, only to the case in which lymph is exuded and purulent matter is secreted, simul- taneously or sviccessively, or, in other words, to the transition from the adliesive to the suppui'ative stage. In certain circumstances this transition does not take place, and purulent fluid may be secreted without the previous effusion of coagulable lymph. The first action of the vessels is then to pour forth serous fluid, and the next is the secretion of puru- lent matter in a more or less perfect form. This is well exemphfied in diffuse inflammation of the filamentous tissue. No doubt can be entertained, from the experi- ments of Brugmami,* Hunter, f and Home, | and * De Puogenia. 8vo.

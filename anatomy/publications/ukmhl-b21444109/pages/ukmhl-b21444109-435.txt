BRAIN. 413 lated in unusual quantity, as they do not so rea- dily admit of distension, rupture is the conse- quence. (Baillie, 454.) Hodgson also shows how generally this morbid state of the cerebral arteries is connected with extravasation. * This cause, however, is predisponent only. A fit of apoplexy may occur and prove fatal in per- sons in whom neither ossification of the arteries of the brain, nor any other state, except mere vascular injection, is found. And, on the other hand, the cerebral arteries may be ossified or steatomatous, in many persons who have never had a single fit of apoplexy. The general result of the cases ob- served by Vater, Morgagni, Cheyne, Howship, Ro- choux, Serres, and Tacheron, is, that disease of the arterial coats is connected with vascular injection, which may terminate, according to circumstances, in serous effusion, pulpy destruction, or bloody extravasation. It is a well established fact, how- ever, that the extravasation does not take place from the diseased arterial trunks, but from the minute capillaries in which these arteries termi- nate. Old age has generally been regarded as a pre- disponent cause of apoplexy ; and it is attended with two circumstances, which are perhaps not altogether without reason regarded as of some moment. The first of these is the venous pletho- ra, so ingeniously maintained by Cullen. The * A Treatise on the Diseases of Arteries and Veins, pp. 25 and 26.

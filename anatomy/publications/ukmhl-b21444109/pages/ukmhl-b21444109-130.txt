Varicose Aneurism. In the case of an artery lying beneath, but not in immediate contact with a vein, or in the case of the wound being oblique and the puncture of the vein not corresponding to that of the artery, the same accident is followed with another variety of tumour. The blood from the arterial tube flows partly into the sheath, which is distended into a sac, and partly into the vein, which is morbidly dilated. The tumour thus re- sulting, the anatomical characters of which are a circumscribed aneurism between the artery and vein, and a varicose state of the latter, has been distinguished as varicose aiieurism. * The filamentous sheath, though not proper to the arterial tissue, performs, nevertheless, an im- portant part in the morbid states of arteries, whe- ther spontaneous or resulting from injuries. It has been already shown what is its influence in the production of genuine aneurism, in the sup- pression of hemorrhage, and in the formation of the several varieties of false or spurious aneuris- mal tumours. It is liable further to the same forms of inflammatory action as attack this tissue in other parts of the animal frame. But inflam- mation here is often attended with the bad effect * Park in Medical Facts and Observations^ Vol. IV. p. 111. Physic k in Medical Museum Philadelphia, Vol. I. p. 65.

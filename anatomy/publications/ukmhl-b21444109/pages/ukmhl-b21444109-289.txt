267 NERVOUS TISSUE. acid for the space of one or two weeks, the neuri- lema is gradually dissolved, and the nervous mat- ter becomes so much indurated and consolidated that it may be separated from the contiguous chords in filaments with great facility * In un- dergoing this change the portion of nerve be- comes much shorter and considerably contracted, —is subjected, in short, to the process of crispa- tion; so that unless a large nerve like the scia- tic be employed for the experiment, it may be im- possible to obtain the result in the most satisfac- tory form. These experiments, with many others of the same nature, were first performed by Pro- fessor Reil, and afterwards repeated and varied by Bichat and by Dr Gordon. Personal repeti- tion of them enables me to assert, that, when cor- rectly conducted, they never failed to give the re- sults as described by these authors. Nervous tissue, like all others, receives a pro- portion of what may be denominated the systems of distribution,—cellular tissue and blood-vessels. In the substance of the former, the disposition of which we have already remarked, we find the more conspicuous branches of the latter distri- buted. In a more minute and divided form they penetrate the neurilema and nervous substance. * According to the experiments of Reil, nitrous acid di- luted with water answers best. Muriatic acid, though equal or even superior in effecting solution of the neurilema, sof- tens the nervous matter too much, and separates the compo- nent filaments too completely.—De Structura, cap. iii. p. l6.

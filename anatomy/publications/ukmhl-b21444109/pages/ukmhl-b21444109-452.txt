Though this has been so frequently observed to occur on the same side with the lesion of the chord, that it may be stated as a general result, it is nevertheless requisite to men- tion, that to Portal we are indebted for a singular case, in which capillary injection and pulpy de- struction of the right side of the lumbar division of the chord, gave rise to palsy of the left inferior extremity. * y. To the antero-posterior diameter of the chord the same observations nearly apply; and it is rare to find the anterior part diseased with- out affection of the posterior, and conversely. In- stances of this, nevertheless, have been observed ; and it is interesting to remark, that the effects which respectively result from lesion of either singly, tend to confirm those inferences which Charles Bell and Magendie have drawn regarding the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. Thus when the anterior part of the chord is affected without the posterior, the effect is loss of muscular power more or less complete, while sensation remains. Conversely, when the posterior part of the chord is injured without the anterior, sensation is more or less obliterated, while voluntary motion is little affected. Thus in a case recorded by Dr Jones, vascular injection of the posterior surface of the chord impaired sen- sation remarkably, but left motion little affected, f * Anatomie Medical, Tome IV. p. 116. t Medical and Surgical Journal, Vol. XXI. p. 81, 83. 4,

302 GENERAL ANATOMY. Gefasshau.t,) must be cautiously removed by dis- section. The convoluted surface communicates with an- other interior surface at two parts; 1*^, on the middle plane, under the posterior end of the mid- dle band or meso-lobe, (corpus callosum) ; Hd, on each side of the middle plane, at the outer mar- gin of the fluted masses termed limbs of the brain, {crura cerebri) (Die Hirnschenkel); between these limbs and the posterior end of the optic chamber or couch, (thalamus opticus J (Der Sehhugel.) This surface of the organ may be termed the central or figurate. The exterior surface of the cerebellum is dif- ferently disposed. Instead of presenting convo- luted eminences, it consists of thin portions of ce- rebral substance, placed contiguously, and either parallel or concentric. These portions, which have been named plates (JamineB,) or leaves {Jblia,) are separated from each other by furrows of various depth. This surface, which may be named the laminar or foliated surface of the small brain, com- municates also with the figurate surface, 1*^, at its superior part on the middle plane, between the semilunar notch (Der halbmondformige Aussch- nitt; Reil) behind, and the white cerebral plate termed Vieussenian valve, before, '^d. At its in- ferior surface between the parts termed almonds by Malacarne, or spinal lobules by Gordon, above; and the upper end {medulla oblongata) of the spinal chord, below. The convoluted surface of each hemisphere may

415 BllAlN. six in persons below 40. Morgagni relates the cases of thirty apoplectic persons, seventeen of whom were above the age of 60, and five be- low that of 40. Of thirty-one cases of bloody ex- travasation in the ventricles or the substance of the brain, recorded by Lieutaud, one was at the age of 25, eight between the ages of 30 and 41, eleven between 41 and 51, six between 51 and 61, two between 61 and 71, two between 71 and 81, and one only above 100. Of twenty-nine cases seen or dissected by Portal, two were between 19 and 23, four between 30 and 41, seven between 41 and 51, eight between 51 and 61, four between 61 and 71? and the same number between 71 and 81. Of 6 cases of cerebral hemorrhage given by Cheyne, three were between 30 and 35, two at 50, and one at 63. Rochoux, however, has given the fullest and most accurate results on this point. Among sixty-three cases of apoplexy, two occurred between the age of 20 and 30, eight between that of 30 and 40, seven between that of 40 and 50, ten between that of 50 and 60, twenty-three be- tween that of 60 and 70, twelve between that of 70 and 80, and only one between that of 80 and 90. According to this view apoplexy is extreme- ly rare before the 30th year ; from that period to the 50th it is not common, but may occur ; after 50 it becomes more common ; between 60 and 70 is more frequent; becomes of the same rate of fre- quency after 70 as before 60, and is very rare af- ter the 80th year.

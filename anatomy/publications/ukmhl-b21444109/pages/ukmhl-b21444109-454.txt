432 GENERAL ANATOMY. it moves with less facility over the skin of any- opposite surface. These qualities, the existence of which may be easily demonstrated, pertain especially to the white substance of the adult brain, when death takes place either accidentally or by an acute dis- ease, without direct lesion of the organ. The consistence of the gray matter of the convoluted surface is inferior to that of the white. The white matter of the twain-band (corjms callosum) is firm and tough in the direction of its cross fibres, and may be pulled to a considerable de- gree without giving way. The cylindrical fluted masses forming the I'tmhs of the brain, (crura) which consist chiefly of white matter, are much firmer than the substance of the striated nucleus, which is mostly gray; and the annular protu- berance, which is chiefly white matter, is the firmest and most tenacious part of the organ. The cerebellum, which consists chiefly of gray matter, is invariably less firm than the brain ; and the firmest part of the former is the substance of the peduncles and the white matter of the cerebellic hemispheres. Of the spinal chord, the cranial part, especially the olivary eminences, are the firmest; and the consistence, though less than that of the brain, is tolerably uniform to the lum- bar region, in which it undergoes a distinct dimi- nution, and finally becomes very loose in the cau- diform expansion. The degree of consistence now attempted to be

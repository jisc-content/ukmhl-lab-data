TENDON. 509 The articular or perfect ligaments are naturally- divisible into two subgenera,—the capsular and the funicular. The capsular ligaments or the fibrous capsules, (Bichat,) consist of cylindrical ligamentous sheaths attached all round to the ends of the articulating bones, and intimately interwoven with the perios- teal tissue. Consisting essentially of fibro-albumi- nous matter strongly compacted, they are sur- rounded by cellular tissue, or rather celluloso-adi- pose tissue, and are lined internally by synovial membrane. Though the most perfect examples of the capsular form of ligament are presented in the scapulo-humeral and coxo-femoral articula- tions, less complete ones, nevertheless, are seen in the other joints. In those of the knee and elbow, an arrangement of this kind may be demonstrated; and minute capsules may be shown to connect the oblique articular surfaces of the vertebrae with each other. The funicular ligaments, which consist of round chords or flat bands, are employed in connecting the articular ends of bones either without or with- in the cavity of the joint. Of those of the former description, the best examples are seen in the el- bow and knee-joints, and in the wrist and ankle, where they are termed /«/^/'«nigaments, (I. later- alia, accessoria,) Of the latter instances, are the round ligaments, (ligamenta teretia,) of the shoul- der and hip-joints, and the crucial ligaments of the knee-joint. These receive an investment of synovial membrane.

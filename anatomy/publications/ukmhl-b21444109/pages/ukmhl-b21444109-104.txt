GENERAL ANATOMY. 84 ly subdivided, they enter into the interior of or- gans, without, however, sinking at once into their intimate substance. In the muscles they are lodged between the fibres; in the brain in the convolu- tions ; in glands between their component lobes. In such situations they are generally observed to be more or less tortuous in the course which they follow. On the reasons of this much difference of opinion still prevails. (Bichat and Magendie.) In the course of the arteries, no circumstance is of greater moment than their mvitual communications or inosculations, {anastomoses.) Of this there may be two forms, the first when two equal trunks unite, the second when a large vessel unites with a smaller one. Of the first, three varieties have been mentioned. 1*^, Two equal trunks may unite at an acute angle to form one vessel. Thus, in the foetus, the ductus arteriosus and the aorta are conjoined ; and the two vertebral arteries unite to form the basilar trunk. 9,d, Two trunks may com- municate by a transverse branch, as the two an- terior cerebral arteries do in forming the anterior segment of the circle of Willis, ^d. Two trunks may, by mutual union, form an arch, from the con- vexity of which the minute vessels arise, as is seen in the branches of the mesenteric arteries. The second mode of inosculation is frequent in the extremities, especially round the joints. The multiplied communications of the arterial system in these regions, though well known to anatomists, and enumerated by Haller, were first clearly and

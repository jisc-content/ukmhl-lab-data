GENERAL ANATOMY. 216 cases delineated by Hooper as vesicles and en- cysted tumour, are evidently of this description. Plenck admits the serous hygroma in the cellular membrane. y. Hcematoma. A cyst secreting, or containing a bloody fluid. Severinus, Ingrassias, and more recently Monteggia, John Peter Frank, Scarpa, and Montini, mention examples of globular or spheroidal tumours containing blood more or less fluid within a membranous sac or covering. Un- der the name of hloody abscess, indeed, Severinus * assembles aneurisms, as well as the blood-cyst. Frank, I believe, first (1786) distinguished one of these tumours on the chin of a girl of nine, of the size and shape of a goose-egg, as of the encysted kind, and first applied to it the denomination of TicBmatoma. f About the same time (1789) Mon- teggia described the bloody tumour similar to that of Severinus, as occurring in the arm-pit, and at- taining a great size, and when opened speedily proving fatal. % An example of the disease was afterwards seen by Scarpa in the same situation in the person of a priest about fifty, in the thy- roid gland and neck of other subjects, and in the * Marci Aurelii Severini apud Neapolitanos Medici ac Philosophi Regii, de Abscessuum Recondita Natura, Libri viii.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 154 go to the outer granulating eminences will be found to be, 1*^, much less numerous ; and, 2d, to be much diminished in size ; and this change will be observed to be most remarkable at the edge, and less at the centre of the sore. It is this diminution in the number and size of the granu- lating capillaries which is the main agent of the process of contraction. As these vessels become less numerous and smaller, the bodies to which they are distributed diminish and become firmer ; and if a wound or part which has been healed by granulation be injected some weeks or mouths after being healed, the vessels will be actually found less numerous and smaller than in the con- tiguous parts of the same tissue. When union by granulation is accompanied with the formation of a thin membrane, Avhich afterwards assumes the appearance and properties of skin, the last part of the process is called skm- 7iing or cicatrization,â€”the formation of a scar. The nature and mechanism of this process will be considered in its proper place. Granulation may be viewed as the means which the several tissues of the human body possess of reproducing themselves, or repairing those losses of substance which result from direct injury, or take place in consequence of disease. Of this process the capillaries of the texture are the agents. But it is uncertain to what extent they possess the power of reproducing the same sort of sub- stance as that of the texture destroyed. The kind of matter which is most generally reproduced

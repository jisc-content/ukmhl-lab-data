667 MUCOUS MEMBRANE. Section II. The morbid states of the mucous membranes are nume- rous and important, and constitute a large proportion of the diseases which daily come under the notice of the physician. Generally speaking, these morbid states may be referred to the following heads : inflammation and its effects, sero-albu- minous effusion, suppuration and ulceration, hemorrhage, induration and thickening producing contraction or stricture, new growths, and malformation. 1. The Inflammatory process in this tissue gives rise to a considerable number of diseases which long usage has dis- tinguished according to the region, the mucous membrane of which is diseased.

In these several divisions of the mucous surfaces the ana- tomical characters of inflammation are much the same. The process takes place vmder two varieties, the spreading or diffuse, which extends over the surface of the membrane; and the punctuate or circumscribed, which affects many points at the same time. The membrane becomes red, in-

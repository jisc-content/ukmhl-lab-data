Serres especially it has been said that hemorrhagic cavities are formed in the fore part, the middle, or the posterior part, of the hemispheres, without affecting the tlialami or striated bodies, much more frequently than is re- presented by Bonetus, Morgagni, and Rochoux. I find from examining the cases of Howship, Ler- minier, Serres, Tacheron, and others, that this is not entirely without foundation. Of 6 cases of cerebral hemorrhage given by Lerminier, 3 are in the hemispheres, 1 in the right optic thala- mus, 1 in the left optic thalamus, and 1 in the left corpus striatum.^ Of 7 cases of cerebral he- morrhage given by Serres, 2 are in the centre or posterior part of the left hemisphere, 1 in both he- mispheres, 1 in the left hemisphere and in the me- solobe,and 3 in the annular protuberance.f Among 19 cases of cerebral hemorrhage or its effects, record- ed by Tacheron, 5 were in the right hemisphere, and 4 in the left, 2 were in the posterior part of the right hemisphere, 2 in the substance of the op- tic eminences, 2 in that of the striated bodies, 1 in the mesolobe and adjoining part of the left ven- tricle, 1 in the annular protuberance, 1 in the op- tic eminence and striated body at once ; and in one, in which the last extravasation took place in the * Annuaire Medico-Chirurgicale, p. 213, et ensuite. f Ibid. p. 324. § xi. et ensuite.

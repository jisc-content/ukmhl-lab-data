The developement or growth of this organ has been recently investigated with much care by Tiedemann, who has ascertained the following points. In the embryo of six weeks, the spinal chord is represented by a flat long substance, the upper end of which is slightly enlarged. In the second month, when the brain is little developed compared with the spinal chord, it may be said to consist, 1st, of a cerebellum, with considerable transverse extent; 2d, of brain proper, exceed- ingly small; Sd, of a third portion placed be- tween these two, and the size of which exceeds that of the brain. This third portion corresponds to the protuberance, or rather to that part of the organ, the upper surface of which is formed by the four eminences, (corpora quadrigemina,) and the lower surface by the annular protuberance. * According to M. Serres, it is formed in man and animals before the brain and cerebellum, and im- mediately after the spinal chord. In the fifth month, the brain covers a part of the protu- berance; it advances to the cerebellum, and in the seventh exceeds it. At the same time, the other parts, and especially that which we have * Anatomie und Bildungs-Geschichte des Gehirns im Foetus des Menschen u, s. f.

88 GENERAL ANATOMY. the inner membrane, or to the proper arterial tis- sue, or to both. 1. Adhesive lyiflammation. The inner mem- brane is liable to inflammation, terminating gene- rally in effusion of lymph, adhesion of the sides, and obliteration of the canal of the tube. This process takes place in all circumstances in which the corresponding surfaces of the vessel are mu- tually applied, while the current of blood through the vessel is interrupted. The pressure of a tour- niquet, or any mechanical object moderately firm ; the pressure of a tumour, or of an aneurism in some instances; the application of a ligature not so tight as to divide the coats; and in the case of small vessels, the spontaneous retraction and col- lapse of its sides after complete division by a cut- ting instrument, are conditions which have been followed by adhesion and obliteration of the canal. On the knowledge of this property depends the practice of tying arterial tubes in wounds, and in the cure of aneurism. Inflammation of the internal arterial membrane may also take place spontaneously, or independent of mechanical causes. Thus the inner membrane of the aorta may be inflamed in persons labouring under general or severe inflammation of the tho- racic viscera. (Portal, Hodgson.) The anatomi- cal characters are deep red colour of the mem- brane, and more or less effusion of lymph in the cavity of the vessel. If the individual survives such a disease, the

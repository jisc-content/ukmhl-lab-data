463 BRAIN. B. Adipose tumour, lardaceous degeneration. (Ceroma.) Peter Borelli is the first who notices the existence of much fat-like matter in the brain of an epileptic svibject. The adipose tumour de- scribed by the Wenzels seems to be the same with that which was previously mentioned by Merat, and which has since been noticed under the name of lardaceous degeneration by the late M. Heb- reart of the Bicetre. The first author describes, under the name of tubercle behind the upper part of the medidla ohlongata, a fatty, reddish, or rose-coloured body, the size of a nut, con- sisting internally of homogeneous substance tra- versed by minute red lines, probably blood-vessels. It was contained in a fine thin envelope. A similar one, though somewhat less, was found in the mid- dle of the left cerebellic hemisphere. By the Aus- trian anatomists it is represented as externally smooth, and of a yellow colour, and internally, when divided, as consisting of adipose ash-colour- ed solid substance, tending in some parts to bony.* Among the many brains which these anatomists examined two only presented this change of * " Tumor exterius laevis erat, colore luteo, (couleiir jauna- tre, of M. Hebreart,)" &c. Persecantes tumorem, intrinsecus inveniebamus quandam adiposam, (" une degenerescence de consistence lardacee" of M. Hebreai't,) subcineream, admodum solidam, sub- stance devenue dure^ lardacee, de couleur jaunatre") sub- stantiam quce parvo quodam loco tactu velut ossea erat."

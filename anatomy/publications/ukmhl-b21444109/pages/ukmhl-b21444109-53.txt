FILAMENTOUS OR CEI,I-ULAR TISSUE. 33 (aposteniata, ahscessiis), acute or chronic, which frequently form in the human body. If inflam- mation of cellular tissue do not terminate in sup- puration, nor is resolved, it terminates in effusion of lymph, with concretion or agglutination of its filaments through a space more or less extensive. This is known by slight swelling, hardness, and immobility of the part. The phenomena of inflam- mation in this tissue are best observed in deep wounds, which divide a considerable extent of it^ If the wound be what is called simply incised, the constitution good, and the inflammation mo- derate, lymph is effused, and the cut edges are united by what was anciently named the first in- tention. This mode of union was termed by John Hunter adhesive inflammation, (p. 226,) and union by adhesion. It is not always, however, that the process is so simple. When the wound is extensive or com- plicated, and involves the cellular web of several different tissues, the lymph effused is inadequate to effect reunion at once ; and another process termed granulation takes place. The basis of this indeed consists in exudation of lymph, which is effused in minute masses of no definite form, and which are soon penetrated by blood-vessels, and thereby become organized, (Hunter, p. 477-) Their surface becomes covered with more or less lymph, which, as they increase in size, causes them mu- tually to cohere; and by the successive produc- tion, growth, and union of these granular bodies, c

48 GENERAL ANATOMY, lopement of the several organs, especially of the lungs, its occasional appearance previous to birth, and its frequency among infants born before the full time, (Palletta,) show that it bears some re- lation to the foetal mode of existence. The pecu- liar nature of the filamentous tissue in the fcetus and in the new-born infant may have some influ- ence in the production of this malady. 6. Serous infiltration, {oedema, anasarca.) Un- der the operation of various causes, as cold, mer- cury, &c. the quantity of serous fluid in the fila- mentous tissue may be considerably increased ; and this increase gives rise to a pale, white, or wan-coloured and cold swelling of the skin, which is distinguished by receiving the impression of the finger or any other substance forcibly applied. The swelling may be local, or confined to one arm, to one leg, to a hand, to part of a limb, to the scrotum, to the face, or so forth ; or it may extend in different degrees to the greater part or the whole of the person. In the former case it is termed Oedema, {oihyiiioi.) or swelling; in the latter it receives the name of Anasarca, am <ragÂ«a, dropsy in the flesh,) and is the aqua intercus of the Romans. It was the white or pale and blanched colour of this sort of swelling which procured for it the name of Leucophlegmatia {hzvKo<p\zy^o!.rK/,) or white inflammation among the ancient physicians. The fluid of the filamentous tissue may co- agulate spontaneously, (Blackall, 263;) but it always undergoes coagulation on the application of heat or the addition of re-agents.

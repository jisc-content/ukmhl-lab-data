462 GENERAL ANATOMY. woman of 20, who, with obstinate vomiting and epigastric pain, had headach at first slight and confined to the hind head, latterly extending to the frontal region, when it was constant and severe. Though the intellectual powers are stated to have been unimpaired to the last, death was preceded by sudden aggravation of her sufierings and loss of consciousness. In the brain were found about thirty or forty small round bodies, resembling the human crystalline lens in colour, size, and consist- ence. In the cerebellum were two similar, and in the spinal chord opposite the last dorsal verte- bra one. In several parts of the organ also were minute abscesses, supposed to be produced by the softening of similar tubercles.* The two cases now noticed are considered as of a strumous nature by the authors under whose observation they fell. It is unfortunate that they have given almost no information on the physical and chemical qualities of the matter thus deposit- ed in the substance of the brain. Though its nature is thus left undetermined, I have ventured to refer them to the present head, because they seem to be deposits of albuminous matter slightly modified, and because they doubtless present some alliance with certain of the forms of tubercular deposition in other textures. * Nouveau Journal de Med.

Journal, Vol. Ivi. p. 8,) may probably be of the same description.

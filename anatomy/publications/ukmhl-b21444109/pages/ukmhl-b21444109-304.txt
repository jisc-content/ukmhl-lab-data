GENERAL ANATOMY. 282 sions, and finally being lost in different degrees, so as to cause palsy more or less complete. This constitutes one form of neuralgia or nerve-ach. It is most frequent in the sciatic, partly in conse- quence of its exposed situation, and sometimes in consequence of actual violence locally inflicted, as in falling. (IscJiias nervosa of Cotunnius.) I have, however, seen this affection arising in other nerves ; for example, the median or spiral, in the arm, and sometimes the posterior tibial, in the leg, in con- sequence of similar causes. In one instance it was confined with accuracy to the anterior branch of the radial nerve, which goes to the thumb and index finger. In such cases the inflammatory ac- tion is confined pretty accurately to a part of the neurilematic coat, which becomes firm, vascular, and more or less tender. In neuralgia of the face (tic douloureux, Fother- giRâ€”prosopalgia, Frank, Weisse,) it is not easy to say what is the pathological cause. It is undoubted that it is seated in the nerve ; and though some forms of this malady evidently depend on inflam- mation of the neurilema, yet others of them, which are of long continuance, and are attended by other peculiarities, are not perhaps to be ascribed to this cause. It is not requisite to suppose that the long continuance of this action, without producing suppuration or other changes, is an argument against its inflammatory character. The inflam- mation may be, like those in fibrous tissue, of long continuance, without inducing any other ef-

GENERAL ANATOMY. 1^4 CHAPTER VI. system of capillary vessels,—termina- tions of arteries,—origins of veins. Section L Though we can scarcely, with propriety, speak of the capillary tissue, or the tissue of capillary vessels, we find it requisite to introduce in this place the general facts of the anatomical peculiari- ties of this important part of the human hody. The term capillary system, though much spoken of in physiological and pathological writings, is perhaps not always precisely defined or distinctly understood. According to Bichat it is not only the common intermediate system between the ar- teries and veins, but the origin of all the exhalant and excreting vessels. * If we consider the modes in which arteries have been said to terminate, and veins to take their origin, we shall find, that in this view of the capillary system there are some things which are doubtful, and some which are in- consistent with the rest.

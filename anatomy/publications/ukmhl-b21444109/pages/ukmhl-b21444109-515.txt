MUSCULAR TISSUE. 493 Section II. 1, Myositis.—Muscle is liable to inflammation, which may be acute or chronic in duration, and may differ according to its kind. One form of muscular inflammation seems to constitute a spe- cies of rheumatism (Carmichael Smyth),* and when this continues long, it terminates in loss of power, constituting a local palsy, a. 3Iyositis Puridenta.—Another form, equally serious and more certainly injurious, is the sup- purative form of muscular inflammation. In this the muscular structure suppurates and sometimes sloughs extensively; and, whether acute or chro- nic, is generally a fatal disease. The most fa- miliar instance of the chronic form of suppurative inflammation in muscle is that which constitutes lumbar abscess,—inflammation of the great psoas muscle.f Of this Schoenmezel records a good ex- ample in the person of a muscular young man of 28, in whom the whole of i\\epsoas magnus and iliacus of the right side was destroyed and converted into purulent matter, forming a sac extending from the last lumbar vertebra along the surface of the * Medical Communications, Vol. ii. pp. 217, 218. t " The most remarkable and complete destruction of mus- cle which occurs from suppuration is that which is seen in the disease called psoas abscess, where the whole or the great- er part of the muscle often disappears, and its capsule is filled with the nnatter of suppuration."-—Thomson on Inflara. p, 152—Lectures, p. 159.

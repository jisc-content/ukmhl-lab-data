In this, apoplectic symptoms are said to take place without any anormal state of the brain or its ves- sels, and from some disorder in the chylopoietic or- gans, which is supposed to induce a torpid condi- tion of the brain, or suspension of its proper energy. It may be doubted whether satisfactory proof of such a state has yet been adduced. 1*^, A fallacy results from the doctrine that hemor- rhage is in all instances requisite to give rise to apoplectic symptoms. I have shown that conges- tion, injection, or distension of the cerebral ves- sels, is adequate to produce this effect; and whe- ther this state is to disappear, remain unchanged, or produce serous effusion, or bloody extravasa- tion, so as to remain after death, will depend much on the constitution of the individual and the treat- ment employed. No satisfactory conclusion can be drawn from the absence of hemorrhage or se- rous fluid. 2d, Disorder of the chylopoietic or- * F. Zuliani De Apoplexia praesertim Nervea. Lipsise, 1780. f C. G.

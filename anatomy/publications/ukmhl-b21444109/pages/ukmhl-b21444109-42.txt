22 GENERAL ANATOMY, less injurious consequence than the former, which by its generahzing spirit has a tendency to super- sede investigation, and to consider the nature of the animal tissues as sufficiently established. This perhaps was the error of Bichat, if his arrangement is chargeable with fault. But with still greater justice it may be said, that the recent attempts at classification, like the imperfect ones of the ancient physiologists, are to be blamed in diminishing too much the number of separate tissues, and in de- livering arrangements, the principles of which are more general and comprehensive than nature war- rants. It may indeed be assumed as a safe principle, that all the svibstances employed in the construc- tion of the animal body, which are not very ob- viously alike, may be considered as separate or distinct proximate principles, till careful examina- tion shall show that they ought to be associated with others. This indeed defeats the purpose of classification, which is useful in proportion as it dis- covers genuine analogies and general resemblances for the purpose of communicating knowledge with facility ; but it also prevents the approach or in- sinuation of error, by the caution with which it examines, and the discrimination with which it adopts. In the short view which I propose here to take of the organic tissues, I shall not adhere scrupu- lously to either of those arrangements which I have already noticed, but attempt to modify that

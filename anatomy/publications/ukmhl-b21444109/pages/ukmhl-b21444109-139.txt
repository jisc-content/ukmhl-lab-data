117 VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. a force applied to the concave surface would either obliterate the circular area of the vessel, tear the valve from the vein, or otherwise meet with re- sistance. The size of the valves is variable. In some in- stances they are sufficiently large to fill the canal of the vessel, and in others they are too small to produce this effect. The obliteration of the cir- cular area of the vessel is most perfect when there are two or three at the same point. Bichat ascribed the variable state of this quality to the di- lated or contracted condition of the veins at the moment of death. This, however, is denied by Magendie. In structure these valvular or parabolic folds are said to consist of a doubling, or two-fold layer of the inner membrane ; and with this statement no fact of which we are aware is at variance. A hard prominent line, which generally marks their attachment of the fixed margin to the vein, is asserted by Bichat to consist of the proper ve- nous tissue, the fibres of which, he says, alter their direction for this purpose; and when the common or inner membrane reaches this line, it doubles or folds itself (elle se rejiUe) to form the valve, which thus consists of two layers of the inner or common membrane. This, however, is denied by Hunter,"* who considers them of a tendinous nature, and by Gordon, who made several unsuccessful attempts to split these two layers, f * X.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 98 have begun at the bifurcation, and spread thence along the vessel. Thus I have seen this depo- sition confined to the point common to the com- -mon carotid, and its external and internal branch- es, and this in both sides in the same subjects I have seen it in another person at the same part of the carotids, and at the point common to the internal carotid and the sylvian artery. Last- ly, in another instance I have found it affecting at once in the same subject the arch of the aorta, where it gives off the innominata and left subcla- vian artery; the descending aorta, where it gives off the coeliac and superior mesenteric, including the beginning of these vessels; and the coeliac, when it divides into its gastric, hepatic, and splenic branches. In describing this morbid state of arteries, Pro- fessor Scarpa, I conceive, confounds it with ossifi- cation. After noticing the loss of fine polish (Vintima tonaca delV arteria perde per certo tratto suo hel Uscio,) which the inner arterial membrane sustains, he represents it as becoming irregular and wrinkled, and successively occupied with yellow spots, which are converted into so many earthy grains or scales, or into steatomatous and caseous concretions. I think they may be justly distinguished, because the calcareous depo- site very often exists without the steatomatous ; and conversely, the steatomatous may be found without the calcareous deposition. I must not omit to mention, nevertheless, that the circum-

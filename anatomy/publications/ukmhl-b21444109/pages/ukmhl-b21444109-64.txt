GENERAL ANATOMY. 4>4> Several of the forms of lumbar abscess, in which there is no affection of the vertebrae or of their li- gaments, are examples of this abscess occurring in the abundant loose filamentous tissue, which con- nects the mesentery, the large vessels, and the psoae muscles to the spine. Boyer also states that they are sometimes seen in the filamentous tissue which connects the serous membranes of the chest and belly to the walls of these cavities. Of the latter I have seen one instance simulating hernia, and by the destruction which it caused of the fibres of the recti muscles, actually leaving a space through which the intestines were protruded. 4. Hemorrhage. Effusion of blood into the fi- lamentous tissue independent of external violence is not common. Of spontaneous and idiopathic hemorrhage no authentic example has been record- ed. It occurs, however, in a secondary manner in land and sea scurvy, (Purpura and Scorbutus.) In the former disease it is rarely to any great extent, save when the complaint has terminated fataUy with large and repeated hemorrhage from the mu- cous membranes. In sea scurvy it is at once fre- quent and considerable. Scarcely a case of this dis- order attains any height, without much effusion of blood into the subcutaneous and intermuscular fi- lamentous tissue. On this effusion in general de- pend the hard, livid tumours, deep in the limbs, with which sea scurvy is attended. The cause of this hemorrhage, or rather the state of the vessels which gives rise to it, is not well known. The

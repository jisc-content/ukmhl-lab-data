VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. ]11 The outermost is a modification of the filamentous tissue, (memhrana cellidosa,) and though less compact, and less thick than the arterial filamen- tous envelope, is in every other respect quite simi- lar, and is in general intimately connected with it. The innermost (memhrana intimaj is a smooth, very thin membrane. Between these is found a tunic somewhat thicker, which is termed the projoer venous tissue, (tunicapropria vence.) The stnicture and aspect of this proper membrane shall be first considered. 1*^, When the loose filamentous tissue in which the blood-vessels are inclosed, and the more deli- cate and finn layer immediately contiguous to the veins, are removed, the observer recognizes a red or brown-coloured membrane, not thick or strong, but somewhat tough, which is the outer surface of the proper venous tunic. If dissected clean, it is tolerably smooth ; but however much so it can be made, a glass of moderate powers, or even a good eye, will perceive numerous filaments ad- hering to it, which appear to be the residue of the cellular envelope. According to Bichat parallel longitudinal fibres, forming a very thin layer, may be distinguished in the larger veins ; but he admits, although they are quite real, that they are always difficult to be seen at the first glance. In the trunk of the in- ferior great vein, (vena cava injeriorj they are always seen, he observes, more distinctly than in tliat of the superior; and they are always more

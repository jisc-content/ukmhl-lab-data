433 BRAIN. defined, varies at different periods of life, and under different circumstances of health and dis- ease. In early life the substance of the brain is very- different in consistence and tenacity. In the foetus and at birth its softness approaches to semi- fluidity. Some weeks after it passes from a soft pulpy substance to a state of greater firmness and tenacity; but at the distance even of many months after birth, it is still much inferior in these qua- lities to the brain of an individual who has at- tained the fourteenth or fifteenth year. In three cases of infants cut off by different acute dis- eases, between the ages of 20 months and 2^ years, I found the brain soft, compressible, elas- tic, but not tough; of the consistence of cus- tard-pudding ; but not quite so firm as to bear much handling or stretching, without being bro- ken or torn. In several cases of children dead , between the 7th and the 11th year of scarlet- fever or measles, the brain was firmer, and had acquired greater tenacity, but was still consider- ably softer and less tough than the brains of adults, who had attained the 18th, 20th, or 22d year. Be- tween 12 and 15 the brain in general acquires a de- cided degree of firmness and tenacity; for, though still highly elastic, it is much less compressible, and much more distensible without laceration than before. This increase of firmness and tena- city is particularly conspicuous in the twainband or mesolobe, in the limbs, in the optic thalamus, E e

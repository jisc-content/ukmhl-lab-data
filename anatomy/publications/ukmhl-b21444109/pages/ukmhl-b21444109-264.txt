GENEi?AL ANATOMY. 242 abounds with lymphatic glands mutually connect- ed in clusters. Each gland may be said to consist of a peculiar substance, inclosed in a tliin membrane like a cap- sule. The capsule is a thin pellucid colourless substance, which is resolved by maceration into fine whitish fibres. It is very vascular; and Mas- cagni appears to have detected absorbents in it. It is connected to the proper substance by fine fila- mentovis or cellular tissue. The capsule is con- sidered by Beclard as a fibro-cellular membrane. The proper substance of lymphatic glands consists of a homogeneous pulp, in which injections have shown numei'ous ramifications of minute vessels. AvÂ«3 these vessels are injected from the lymphatics which are seen to enter the body of the gland, they are believed to be continuous with them, and to be lymphatics arranged in a peculiar manner. These vessels are of two kinds, one entering the gland called vasa qfferentia or inferentia, entrant lymphatics ; the other quitting is called vasa effe- rentia, egredient lymphatics. This distinction is founded on the dii'ection of the valves. In the vasa inferentia the free margins of the valves are turned toward the gland; in the vasa efferentia they are turned from it. The number of entrant lymphatics varies from one to thirty, and, what is more remarkable, al- most never corresponds with that of the egredient lymphatics, which are in general much fewer. Cruickshank says he has injected fourteen entrant lymphatics to one gland, to which only one egre-

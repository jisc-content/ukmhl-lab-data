In the anterior and external part of the left hemisphere was found a firm red-brown tumour, the size of an egg, round, flattened, filled with blood, which in certain places appeared to be contained as in the spleen, in others in small clots of a line diameter of an areolar-cellular tissue, grayish, dense, and analogous in appearance to the matter of tubercles. Adhering without to the dura mater of the arachnoid, which was red and much thickened, it was lodged in a depression of the hemisphere. The contiguous cerebral matter was in the state of yellow ramollissement.* In his tenth engraving Dr Hooper gives a good delineation of an example of this disease. In this case the tumour, which was of an irregular oblong spheroidal shape, about 3^ inches long and 2^ broad, arose by a broad base from the white cere- bral substance of the left hemisphere near the ven- tricle, but not communicating with that cavity. Externally it was of a pink-red, or pale carmine colour, and of an irregularly lobulated arrange- ment. Though soft to the touch, it was elastic and cut firm, exposing a vascular mottled surface of a reddish-yellow colour, with portions of blood- like structure here and there. Besides the pia mater, which it raised, it was covered by a deli- cate and very vascular membrane, laminated and shaggy. * J.A.RochouXjRecherches sur I'Apoplexie. A Paris, 1814. Obs. 38. p. 149-

ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 75 mical principles ; but no similar effect takes place in muscular fibres. According to Berzelius the proper arterial tunic contains no fibrine.* Beclard, however, asserts, that he has ascertained that it contains a portion of this principle; but neverthe- less hesitates to consider it as a muscular or fibri- nous tissue, and expresses his opinion, that it would be with greater propriety referred to that order of substances which he has named yellow or tawny fibrous system. The consideration of the physiological or or- ganic properties leads to similar results. Neither mechanical nor chemical agents applied as stimu- lants produce any change or motion in the living arterial membrane. 1. The arteries of an ampu- tated limb, exposed the moment after amputation, while the muscles are in active motion, do not con- tract or move when punctured by the scalpel. 2. The experiments of Bikker and Van-den-Bos with the electric spark, and those of Vassalli-Eandi, Giulio, and Rossi, with the galvanic pile, may be considered as disproved by the experiments of Nysten, t who found ho contraction in the human aorta after violent death, while the heart and other muscles could still be excited. In performing the same experiment with the artery of the living dog this physiologist was equally disappointed. * A View of the Progress of Animal Chemistry. By J. J. Berzelius, M. D. &c. &c.

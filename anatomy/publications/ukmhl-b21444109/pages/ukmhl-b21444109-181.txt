SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 159 from the daily phenomena of purulent collections, that suppuration is a process analogous to, if not the same as secretion. * This is demonstrated in the case of mucous and serous membranes, in which purulent matter is formed without breach of surface, and in which, therefore, its formation must be ascribed to a new action of the vessels. It does not, however, follow from this that these vessels perform, as Hunter imagined, the office of a gland. This notion ap- pears to be adopted merely to render the concep- tion of suppuration more distinct than it would be if simply ascribed to the action of vessels. Suppuration is the direct and exclusive, or the concurrent elfect of inflammation. It is generally the direct effect in inflammation of the mucous membranes, often in that of the serous membranes, and it is so in diffuse inflammation of the filamen- tous tissue. In cii'cumscribed inflammation in the filamentous tissue, in inflammation of the skin, and occasionally in inflammation of the serous mem- branes, it is preceded by exudation of coagulable lymph, and is either concurrent or successive to it. Suppuration is represented by Hunter as always preparatory to granulation. This, however, must be understood to apply to suppuration of cellular tissue, and those textures of which it makes part. In mucous and serous membranes suppuration may, and almost invariably does, take place without â€¢ " This new structure or disposition of vessels I shall call glandular, and the effect or pus a secretion."

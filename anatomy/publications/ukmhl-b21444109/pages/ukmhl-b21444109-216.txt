194 GENERAL ANATOMY. consist of a congeries of arteries and veins. * In tliis state it is firm, and the throbbing is indis- tinct; but as the cellular net-work, which ulti- mately forms the bulk of the swelling, is develop- ed, it becomes more compressible, and the pulsa- tion becomes more evident. At last it a])pears to consist of a cluster of sacs of a purple or li\ id co- lour, which burst from time to time, and bleed profusely. Anastomotic aneurism may occur in any part of the body in which the capillary ves- sels are niunerous. Mr Bell saw it in the face, near the angle of the eye. Mr Freer saw it ^vith- * " The tumour is a congeries of active vessels j and the cellular substance through which these vessels are expand- ed resembles the cellular part of the penis, the gills of a tui'key cock, or the substances of the placenta, spleen, or womb. It is apparently a very simple structure that ena- bles those parts, (the womb, the penis, the spleen,) to per- form their functions ; and it is a very slight change of orga- nization that forms this disease. The tumour is a congeries of small and active arteries, absorbing veins, and interme- diate cells. The irritated and incessant action of the arte- ries fills the cells with blood ; from these cells it is reabsorb- ed by the veins ; the extremities of the veins themselves perhaps dilate into this cellular form. There seems to be a perpetual circulation of blood ; fur there is incessant pulsa- tion. The tumour is permanent, but its occasional varia- tion of bulk is singular. It swells like the penis in erection, or the gills of a turkey-cock in a passion. It is puffed up by exercise, drinking, or emotions of the mind. It is filled and distended with blood upon any occasion which quickens the circulation, as by venery, menstruation, tlie pleasures of the table, heated rooms, or the wnrmth of the bed."â€”Prin- ciples of Surgery, p. 457-

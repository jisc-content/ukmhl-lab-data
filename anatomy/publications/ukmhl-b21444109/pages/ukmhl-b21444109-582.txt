558 GENERAL ANATOMY. ship, a simply, osseous node, {periostosis.) This appears in the form of loose bony masses, plates, or scales, on the surface of such cylindrical bones as the tibia and ulna, which are, nevertheless, quite natural. In some instances this osseous node ap- pears to consist in ossification of the inner part of a circular area of inflamed periosteum. In both cases, instead of the regular arranged longitudinal canals, the new osseous deposition presents irre- gular cavities, varying in size and direction.*" This, together with great vascularity, constitutes the anatomical character of such deposits. In the skull of a child under 7 before me, periosteal in- flammation has>produced on the parietal bone a circular area the size of a shilling, of minute sphe- rical or spheroidal eminences, surrounded by a smooth whitish ring, and that inclosed by a dark- er coloured ring. The circular area, with rough eminences, marks the space from which the pe- riosteum was detached. It is thicker and less translucent than the rest of the bone. The white ring indicates the tract where the pericranium was inflamed, but not detached. y. If the inflammation be acute, as in that from injury, it may produce ulcerative absorption of the subjacent bone, which then presents a de- nuded, rough, reddish surface, progressively in- creasing in extent and depth. This occurs parti- cularly in young subjects. I have seen it in the * Howship in Medico-Chirurg. Trans. Vol. viii. pp. 90, Agd 105, 106.

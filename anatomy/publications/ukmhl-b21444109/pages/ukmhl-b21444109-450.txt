GENERAL ANATOMY. 428 of the spinal chord or its membranous coverings. This inference, nevertheless, is not in its present state susceptible of that degree of accuracy which entitles it to a place among the established princi- ples of pathology. Though in some instances ca- pillary injection of the chord and the origins of the spinal nerves is attended with tonic spasms of the muscular system, in a great number, perhaps a larger proportion, no contractions of this kind take place, notwithstanding every morbid change from vascular injection to pulpy destruction or suppuration. Tetanic spasms, Ollivier infers, are connected with the advanced and intense forms of the disease; but the cases collected, not only by this author himself, but by Pinel, Velpeau, and Aber- crombie, show, that in some of the most aggra- vated forms of the disease no spasms had taken place till the last few hours of existence. In short, the circumstances under which tonic spasms occur in connection with vascular injection and inflam- mation of the chord, have not yet been distinctly indicated. From the cases observed by Reid, Du- chatelet, and Martinet, Jones, Ollivier, and Dun- can Junior, tetanic spasms appear to be more fre- quently connected with injection of the membranes than of the substance of the chord. The variation of effects according to the region of the chord affected may be distinguished into three heads;â€”as the morbid process affects the longitudinal extent, the transverse breadth, or the antero-posterior thickness of the chord.

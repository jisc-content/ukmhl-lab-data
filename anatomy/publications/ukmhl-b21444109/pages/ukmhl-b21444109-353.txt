BRAIN. 331 band {corpus callosum,) over which, and along the upper surface about one inch, it may be traced; and beyond this it is seldom capable of being distin- guished from the white matter of which the central band consists. * The gray indented band, there- * The importance of this object in forming the outer bor- der of the great communication, will render it not improper to glance at the history of its discovery. Vicq-D'Azyr is supposed to have been the first anatomist who observed and described its site and appearance with accuracy; and we find him, in a Memoir of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1787, detailing its peculiarities with some minuteness, un- der the name of " Bord externe et dentele de la Corne d'Ammon." He subsequently represented it in his great work in the year 1786, under the name of gray, cortical, ex- ternal, notched portion of the Horn of Ammon, and speaks of it familiarly enough by the term of corps godronnee. Bichat, however, whose descriptive anatomy was published considerafcly later, though his accurate manner prevent- ed him from overlooking it, and led him to give a suffi- ciently minute account of it, boldly asserted, that it had been entirely neglected by authors. Dr Gordon of this place, who was quite aware of this oversight in Bichat, took special care, in demonstrating it, to notice the merit of Vicq- D'Azyr ; and he has mentioned this fact shortly in a note, in his description of the gray band. None of these eminent anatomists have been altogether right in this matter; and the truth is, that Vicq-D'Azyr is not the first who deli- neated this body. The gray indented band is distinctly re- presented by Pierre Tarin, in the second engraving of his Adversaria ; and although this had been published at least thirty years before the engravings of Vicq-D'Azyr, yet it was requisite for the latter writer to make it the subject of a particular memoir, and Bichat to write a description of it, before it seems to have been known as a part of the organ.

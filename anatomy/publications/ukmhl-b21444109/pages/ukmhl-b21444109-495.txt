Of these earthy deposits no analysis has yet been made. It is, however, not improbable that they consist chiefly of lime, united either with carbonic or phosphoric acid, or both. Dr Hooper has delineated in his twelth engraving a bony tumour, or what he names a tubercle, which is said to consist of the same materials as healthy bone, with a little more animal matter. It it not stated whether this was found in the cerebral sub- stance or connected with the membranes. From its appearance, however, and the fact now stated of its chemical character, I think it next to cer- tain that it was of the latter description. Upon the whole, it may be inferred, that the substances denominated concretions of the hrain consist of in- filtrations or depositions of calcareous matter in the substance of the organ. To this head may be referred the concretions found in the conarium or pineal gland. In this body small sabulous or calcareous particles have been very often found ; and it was long supposed, partly in consequence of the hypothetical opinions of Descartes, that this change could not fail to af- fect materially the functions of the entire organ. For correct information on this point, we are in- * Journal de Physiologie, Tome ii. p. 110.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 286 ologists in the case of excision, or removal of por- tions of a nervous trunk. Though the nerves have been divided by many, the first accurate ex- periments made with a view to ascertain their re- productive power were performed by Cruickshank. This anatomist found, that, when a portion of nerve is removed by incision, its place is supplied by blood and lymph, which first becomes vascu- lar and organized, and is afterwards converted into a substance of the same colour as nerve; and which, though not fibrous, he regarded as ner- vous.* These experiments were repeated by Fon- tana, who, after much hesitation, came to the con- clusion that nervous matter is reproduced f ; by Arnemann, who denied that the new-formed mat- ter is nerve |; by Haighton, who inferred that this substance is really and truly nerve ยง; by Ba- ronio, II Michaelis,^ and Meyer, ** who have ar- * Experiments on the Nerves, particularly on their Re- production^ &c.

Its inflam- mation may cause in like manner thickening, morbid deposits, and ulceration, or even death of the subjacent cartilage. Such is the course of phenomena occasionally observed in the cartilages of the larynx and those of the ribs. 8. Sjyarganosis. Rhemnatismus. Rheumatism. Fascial inflammation.

Independent of the fact, that the rheumatic pains occur often round joints in which there are no muscles, the theory is at best only an ingenious assumption, and is not supported by any strong facts or arguments. Though rheumatic pain is often referred to muscular parts, it is less frequently so than to joints and parts covered by aponeurotic sheaths and fascicB. Of 520 cases, Haygarth observed in 388 the rheumatic action to be seated in joints, in 118 in muscular parts, and in 14 wandering, general, or migrating through the limbs. Of 170 cases, in 154 one or more joints were inflamed ; in 33 cases, both joints and muscles were simul- taneously affected ; and in some cases only were the muscles affected without the joints. Though from these facts Dr Haygarth infers that acute rheumatism is seated chiefly in the

GENERAL ANATOMY. 208 Abernethy * especially, as well as those of Bicliat, establish the point as to the stomach and small intestines in hcematemesis and melcena. In dy- sentery the blood, however copious it may appear, oo^es from a large extent of the surface of the lower end of the ileum, and from that of the colon, without ulceration or gangrene, and evidently from the vessels of the villous membrane, which during health secrete mucous and intestinal fluid. The same is to be understood of hemorrhages from the rectum, indiscriminately known under the name of hcBunorrliois and hemorrhoidal dis- charges, and erroneously supposed to proceed in all cases from the hemorrhoidal veins. The true source of many of those bloody discharges is the vessels of the villous membrane of the bowel. In the exhalants of the genito-urinary mucous system the same condition takes place. Hemor- rhage from the kidney, unless caused by calculus, is the result of exhalation. Menstruation, both in the sound state and when excessive, is equally so.

London, 1811. t " It happened that a woman died when her menses were flowing. Dr Hunter examined the internal surface of the uterus, found it exceedingly red and loaded with blood ; that the principal redness was from the distended and con- voluting arteries. He pressed forward the blood, which was fluid, and which, he asserted, never coagulated, and saw it appear on the surface near the extremities of these arteries.

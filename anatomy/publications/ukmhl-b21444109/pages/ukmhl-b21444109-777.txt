SEROUS MEMBRANE. 753 eminences of each thalamus into the posterior-in- ferior cornu, or sinuosity of the lateral ventricle, where it covers the great Jiippocainpus. Fourth- ly, it may be traced at the angle between the cere- hellum and medulla oblongata, or what is named the bottom of the fourth ventricle, where it forms a very minute choroid plexus seldom noticed by anatomists, but not less distinct, and which may be traced up the fourth ventricle to be connected with the velum interpositum in the middle ven- tricle, and with the lateral portions of the hippo- campus on each side. Each choroid plexus, or, to speak more accurately, each of the divisions of the choroid plexus now enumerated, may be shown to be mutually connected, and to form parts of one ge- neral membrane, which again constitutes the inner or central division of the great membrane of which the jom mater forms the exterior. Each division of the choroid plexus, in like manner, is connected, by means of minute blood-vessels, to the portion of the figurate cerebral surface on which it rests, and it appears to perform the same function of sustaining vessels as the pia mater does to the convoluted surface. The membranous nature and appearance of the choroid plexus may be demonstrated by immers- ing it in clear watei', when, by a little manage- ment of the probe and forceps, it may be spread out exactly like the pia mater, which it closely resembles. It presents the appearance of a thin semitransparent web, one surface of which is 3 B

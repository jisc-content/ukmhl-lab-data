DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 15 These different forms of animal substance he considers as the organic elements, or proximate principles, to use the language of chemistry, into which animal bodies may be resolved. These elementary tissues he again refers to two great orders,â€”one generally distributed and every- where present, so as to form an integrant part of every other animal substance. To this order, which he termed general or generating systems, he referred cellular membrane, arterial and venous tissue, the nerves, and the exhalants and absor- bents. The substances of the second kind, which are placed in determinate situations, and confined to particular regions, consist of the bones, carti- lages, fibrous substances, muscles, and muscular parts, the mucous, serous, and synovial membranes, glandular organs, the skin and its appendages, the nails, hair, &c. All the substances of this latter order consist of a peculiar matter, by which they are distinguished, and more or fewer of the gene- ral tissues. As the structure and properties of the same elementary tissue are nearly the same in what- ever region of the body it is found, or under- go only such modifications as its peculiar use or local connections render requisite, a just idea of the structure of the human body suggests the propriety of considering the extent, disposition, structure, and most obvious properties, mechanical and vital, of each tissue by itself. The examina- tion of these circumstances constitutes the subject

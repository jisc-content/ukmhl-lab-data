GENERAL ANATOMY. 664 The thin serous or sero-mucous fluid with which they are at all times moistened, has led every author almost, and among the rest Haller and Bichat, to infer the existence of arteries with open mouths, or what are termed exhalant vessels. If this be entirely denied, the pathologist, as well as the physiological inquirer, is deprived of a con- venient source of explaining many vital pheno- mena. It has been admitted, nevertheless, more on analogical than direct proofs. The injections of Bleuland are the only experiments after those of Kawe Boerhaave, which, so far as I am ac- quainted, tend to confirm the conclusion.* These experiments, nevertheless, require to be repeated and extended. That lymphatics are distributed to mucous membranes is a point well established. Cruick- shank saw the lymphatics proceeding from the pulmonic mucous membrane loaded with blood in persons and animals dying of hsemoptoe. Their existence in the gastro-enteric mucous membrane has been long established. The mucous surfaces are also freely supplied by nervous twigs and filaments, derived in general from the nerves of automatic life. It is a mis- taken view, nevertheless, to ascribe the sensibility * Experimentum Anatomicum, quo Arteriolarum Lym- phaticarum existentia probabiliter adstruitur, &c. a Jano Bleuland, M. D. Lug.

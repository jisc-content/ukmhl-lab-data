275 NERVOUS TISSUE. From this arrangement immediately arise the individual nervous branches which form the nerves of the arm, and which are named brachial nerves. The interlacement of minute nervous threads be- tween the seventh and eighth cervical and the first dorsal, is what Scarpa has termed the plexus minor. He says it is peculiar, in being quite uni- form, and in connecting those nervous branches which, from their subsequent destination, are call- ed Median and Ulnar. This description, though not generally appli- cable, will communicate some faint idea of the nervous unions and interlacements termed plexus or weavings. For more minute information on the distribution, arrangement, and configuration of this part of the nervous system, we must refer to the work of Scarpa already quoted. * Plexiform arrangements are not confined to the exterior regions of the body. They are more numerous internally; and almost all the organs of the chest and belly have each a plexus, sometimes two, from which they derive their nervous chords. Plexiform arrangements are generally situate in the neighbourhood of blood-vessels, and in some instances inclosing considerable arterial trunks more or less accurately. Thus the axillary plexus surrounds the axiUary artery. The coeliac artery is surrounded with the solar plexus; and the co- ronary, hepatic, splenic, superior mesenteric, and * Annotation.

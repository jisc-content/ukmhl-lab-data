This, which was the opinion of Mor- gagni, is proved by the cases of Mr Brodie, Mr Parkinson, Dr O'Brien, and Dr Duncan. 9,d, That it does not exist from the origin of the discharge may be inferred when the patient is suddenly at- tacked with acute pain deep in the head, intoler- ance of sound, and delirium, quickly followed by insensibility and coma. 3c?, It is improbable that a disease, commencing with the acute symptoms to which the formation of this abscess can gene- rally be traced, should be going on for years with- out deranging more considerably the faculties of sensation, thought, and motion. This disease is generally observed in young subjects of the habit named strumous. So far as I have observed or read, though it takes place in one of two modes, either as an extension of the original disease of the ear and cerebral mem- branes, or an alternating and vicarious result, the latter is most frequently its genuine character. The abscess is contained in an irregular cavity, surrounded by lymph and cerebral matter, which is very vascular. It is in all cases attended with inflammation, thickening, and suppuration of the membranes. The pici mater is highly vascular, and more or less covered with lymph. The dura

GENERAL ANATOIMY. 554 broken portion of bone after some time recovers the same organization and firmness nearly which it originally possessed. Instead of the longitudi- nal canals which are found in compact healthy bone, however, the renewed part presents a series of irregular cavities, varying in size and direction, and which contain a vascular, filamentous, medul- lary web. (Howship.) According to Mr John Bell it remains for years more vascular than the contiguous bone. * According to Howship it pos- sesses a larger proportion of animal matter, f In some instances of fracture union is not ac- complished in this perfect manner ; but is effect- ed merely by a fibro-albuminous cicatrix, which unites the fragments loosely. This is observed especially in fractures of the neck, of the thigh- bone, (Bell, Desault, Cooper, Howship;) of the knee-pan, (Camper, Callisen ;) of the olecranon, and other parts of loose cancellated structure. Upon the reasons of this physiologists are not agreed. By some it is ascribed to defect of perios- teum, as in the neck of the thigh-bone (A. C. Hutchinson ;) by others it is attributed to ineffi- * Principles of Surgery, Vol. i. p. 50?. Disc. 12. " Hav- ing cut off the limb of a soldier whose limb had been broken in America twelve years before, I found upon injecting the bone, that while the bone itself received the red colour of the injection pretty freely, the callus, which goes in a zig- zag form, joining together the several ends and points of a very oblique fracture, was very singularly red." + Experiments and Observations, &c.

749 SEROUS MEMBRANE. I shall afterwards show is the exterior division of the arachnoid membrane. The dura mater is an extensive membrane, and lines not only the interior surface of the scull, but that of the whole vertebral column. Here indeed it undergoes some modification. The inner sur- face of each vertebra has a proper periosteum continuous with the periosteum of the outer sur- face ; and from this issues a quantity of filamentous tissue, which penetrates directly a membranous canal, evidently of fibrous structure, {theca verte- bralis) tough and firm, but more delicate than the cranial dura mater. The dura mater in its course forms sundry prolongations ; for instance, the large crescentic one named the Jcdx, the hori- zontal one termed tentorium, and the small cres- centic one named Jalx minor or cerehelli. The thin, soft, or immediate and proper cerebral membrane, (pia mater, meninx tenuis,) presents in like manner two surfaces, a smooth or cranial, which is exterior, a filamentous or cerebral, which is interior and central. The outer or smooth surface of the thin mem- brane, (pia mater) has a glistening appearance ; and if examined attentively, it is found to be formed by a very thin transparent membrane, exactly similar to that which forms the cerebral surface of the dura mater. It is possible to recog- nize through it the subjacent cerebral part of the membrane, its vessels, and the appearance of the brain itself. This surface has been named in the

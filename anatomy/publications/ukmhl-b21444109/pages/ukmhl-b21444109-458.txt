436 GENERAL ANATOMY. of 24, cut off by phthisis, to be 1^ grain lighter than the same bulk of sound brain. Confinement, with inactivity and low diet, tend to impair the firmness of the brain. Thus in con- demned felons and others who have been impri- soned for some time previous to death, either vio- lent or natural, the brain is found unusually soft. Dr Monro tertius,ihe present Professor of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh, who has had nu- merous opportunities of examining the brains of persons cut off under these circumstances, states that in criminals in general he found the brain unusually soft; and in a young man otherwise healthy, who was put to death for piracy, the brain was so soft that it gave way at the corpus callosum. The softness appears, from the ac- count of Dr Monro, to be greater internally than externally, so that it was impossible to demon- strate the deep-seated parts of the organ.* In opposition to this, however, I must not omit to mention that Littre found the substance of the brain, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, unusu- ally compact and dense in a felon, who, to avoid public punishment, killed himself by dashing his head against the wall of his cell, f To the same head probably is to be referred a form of diminished consistence, without change of texture, which is occasionally observed in the * The Morbid Anatomy of the Brain.

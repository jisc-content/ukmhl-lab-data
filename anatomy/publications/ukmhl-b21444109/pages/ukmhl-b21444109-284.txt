GENERAL ANATOMY. 262 considerable fallacy. Scarpa seems to view it as connected, in anatomical origin and character, with the hard membrane, {meninx dura, dura mater.) He'll, who devoted more care and time to the exa- mination of its nature and structure than any other inquirer, represents it as consisting of cellular substance, many blood-vessels, and some lympha- tics. * Bichat thought it resembled the soft mem- brane of the brain, {pia meninx, pia mater,) and was derived from it. -\ Gordon considers the neu- rilema of the cerebral nerves as consisting of soft membrane {pia mater) at their origin, but in all other situations as a species of cellular membrane. By Mayer the neurilema is accounted a fibrous tissue, for the following reasons. 1st, It consists almost entirely of tendinous fibres, and is cellular only where it is very thin. 2c?, The transverse folds presented by most of the nerves, and which give them a dentilated form, are derived from the neurilema, are of fibrous character, and are simi- lar to those observed in tendinous sheaths. 2d, Several nervous productions are actually convert- ed into tendinous or fibrous filaments; for exam- ple, the brain of the snail tribe, {Umagons,) and the spinal chord both in these and other animals at the Cauda equina. Uh, The neurilema is ei- ther a continuation of the proper cerebral mem- brane, {pia mater,) or very similar to it; and this membrane is fibrous and aponeurotic at the spi- nal chord, and even at its upper end, and, accord- * De Structura Nervorum, cap. i. p. 3. t Anatomie Generale, p. 137, &c. \

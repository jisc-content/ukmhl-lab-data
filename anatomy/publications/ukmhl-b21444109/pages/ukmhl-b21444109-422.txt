In other respects, however, the researches of this physician tend to establish the general inference, that extravasation is not necessary to apoplexy. 1st, From experiments made on living animals, t from the phenomena of effusions of blood either spontaneously, or from wounds and injuries of the head, it appears that a considerable quantity of blood or other fluid may be effused in various parts of the brain with- out causing apoplectic symptoms. (Wepfer, Val- salva, and Serres.) 2d, From various cases it ap- pears that the apoplectic symptoms connected with extravasation disappear, while the extra- vasated blood remains. (Serres's Cases, 7j 8, 9j 10, 11, 12, and others.) Sd, It results from cases recorded not only by Morgagni, Baillie, and Ro- choux, as above-mentioned, but by the physicians of Breslau, % by Quarin, by Stark, ^ and more recently, I may add, by Dr Abercrombie, that complete symptoms of apoplexy may result from * Nouvelle Division ties Apoplexies ; par M.

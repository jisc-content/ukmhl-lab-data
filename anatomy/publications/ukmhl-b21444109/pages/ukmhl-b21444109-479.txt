They were very firm, of a dusky red colour, and with streaks of white interposed. Dr Powell, in Medical Transactions, Vol. v. Case xi. p. 241.—A man of 30, with excruciating pain of the head more or less constant, followed by impaired vision, dilated pupil, and at length an apoplectic attack, which in two days terminated life. From the inferior part of the anterior lobe of the left hemisphere projected a firm mass, of the size of a large walnut, and when cut into resembling a large absor- bent gland. It was surrounded by softened cerebral substance, which was of a light-brown colour, and so pulpy as to give the sensation of a semifluid. y. Tubercular Depositioti, ( Tyroma.)—Under the head of tubercles and scrofulous growths of the brain, various changes, some not very similar, have been described. Though the terms tubercle and scrofula have been perhaps applied too vaguely, these differences, however, if well examined, will be found to consist more in the external form in which the tubercular matter is deposited, than in any essential change in its intimate characters. The term tubercular depositioti, therefore, I adopt for the purpose of designating matter of a white or pale-yellow colour, firm, like soft cheese, but less tough, sometimes granular and friable, and consisting chiefly of a large proportion of albumi- nous matter. The substance thus defined may be deposited in various forms. In the brain these seem referable chiefly to two;—1. one, two, or more homogeneous individual masses of consider- able size; and 2. several, sometimes many, minute

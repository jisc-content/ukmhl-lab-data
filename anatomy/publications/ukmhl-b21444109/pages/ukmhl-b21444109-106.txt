86 GENERAL ANATOMY. 2. The second termination which may be men- tioned here is that into the coloui-less artery, (ar- teria non rubra.) This is sufficiently well esta- blished by the phenomena of injections. 3. A third termination which is supposed to exist, bvit of which no sensible proofs can be given, is that into colourless vessels supposed to open by minute orifices on various membranous sur- faces, and therefore termed exhalants. The na- ture of these vessels shall be considered after- wards. Haller admits a termination in, or communica- tion with lymphatic vessels, but allows that it is highly problematical. Partial communications have been traced between arteries and lymphatics by several anatomists ; but the point requires to be again submitted to accurate researches. Another mode of termination, that namely into excreting ducts, admitted by Haller, scarcely re- quires particular mention. So far as an artery can be said to terminate in such a manner, it would come under the head of that into exhalant vessels. Many of the proofs mentioned by Haller, however, may be shown to be examples of a morbid state of the mucous membranes of these ducts, in which their capillary vessels are disorganized. In considering the several terminations of ar- teries, it is not unimportant to advert to the dis- tribution of these vessels. Injections show that they penetrate into every texture and organ of the animal body, excepting one or two substances in

516 GENERAL ANATOMY. joints, he does not attempt to ascertain the par- ticular texture, in the affection of which the dis- ease consists. It is further manifest, that while it is impossible to exclude affection of the muscles entirely, it results that this affection is only se- condary. The proof adduced by Dr Scudamore from pressure of the whole course of a muscle, and grasping its substance during severe rheuma- tism, to show that the fleshy part is not the seat of complaint, is entitled to attention. Combined with those already mentioned, and with other con- siderations to be adduced immediately, it results that the rheumatic action is seated in a texture, which, confined neither to the site of the joints, nor to that of the muscles exclusively, is common to both, and which, from its extensive distribution and complicated arrangement, accords best with the phenomena, progress, and effects of the dis- ease. It is unnecessary to repeat the considera- tions above adduced from the anatomical rela- tions and characters of fascia and its various di- visions. That they are the chief seat of acute rheumatism may be inferred from the following circumstances. 1. When the rheumatic action is seated in mus- cular parts, instead of being confined to the mus- cular fibres, it may always be referred to the apo- neurotic membrane which covers or penetrates them. 2. The peculiar pains of rheumatism are always most distinct in those situations in which several folds of aponeurotic membrane meet; and

364 GENERAL ANATOMY constituting the laminar tubercle or nodule (das Knotclien.) The spinal chord is the last part of the central class of organs coming under the head of brain. It may be viewed as two longitudinal bands unit- ed by the middle. Both are fibrous internally throughout their entire length ; and in the lum- ber region of the canal these fibres are separated and expanded into a true brush-like arrangement, named cauda equina. Some anatomists have imagined they could recognize cross fibres in the chord; but, with the exception of what has been stated regarding the connection of the restiform processes, nothing of this nature can be regarded as established. Some anatomists have also thought it possible to demonstrate the existence of a longitudinal ca- vity or canal in the spinal chord. In the adult this never exists in the normal state. The canal of the chord is part of the foetal structure only; and in this respect it is to be viewed as one of many peculiarities of formation belonging to the lower animals, through which the human foetus passes in the early stage of developement. A longitudinal canal is found in the spinal chord, during the whole course of existence, in reptiles, fishes, and birds. In mammiferous animals in ge- neral it is always found in the foetus, and conti- nues in several for some time after birth. (Sewel, F. Meckel, and Tiedemann.) As the animal grows, however, it ceases to be found; and the

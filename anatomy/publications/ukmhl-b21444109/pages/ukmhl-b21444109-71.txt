FILAMENTOUS OK CELLULAR TISSUE. 51 This cause of the great vascularity, and its influ- ence in increasing the size of the tumour, are par- ticularly insisted on by Mr John Bell, and after- wards by Mr Abernethy. The vascular sarcoma is enclosed in a thin cap- sule, which is formed of filamentous tissue much condensed by the pressure of the enclosed tumour. It may occur in any part or organ of the human body where filamentous tissue penetrates ; but it Is also found in the female breast, in the testicle of the male, and in the absorbent glands of both sexes. When it occurs in the testicle the vessels are said to be numerous and small. When it af- fects the female breast the vessels seem to be ra- ther large than numerous, and the organization appears less complete. (Abernethy.) 9. Melanosis. The black deposite named 3Ie- lanosis is often found in this tissue ; and perhaps when it is said to occur in the interior of muscles, glands, and other tissues, it is in their filamen- tous substance that it is deposited. As it is, how- ever, still more frequent in the adipose membrane, the points of its history deserving notice shall be introduced under that head. 10. Tubercle. I am uncertain whether to this tissue should be referred the small painful bodies situate beneath the skin, so well described by Mr Wood. * Though situate, as described by Mr Wood, in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, some * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, Vol. VIII. p. 283 and 429-

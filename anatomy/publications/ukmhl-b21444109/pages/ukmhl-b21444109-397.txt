BllAIN. 375 the sole agent is the vascular membrane; {meninx tenuis^ pia mater et plexus choroides; das Gef- fasshaut.) The two divisions of this, viz. the ex- ternal, or that belonging to the convoluted sur- face, and the internal, or that pertaining to the fi- gurate, may be distinguished previous to the for- mation of any part of the brain, and when the two portions, which are afterwards destined to be se- parate, are the same, and indistinguishable from each other. The formation of the organ appears to commence at once upon two orders of vessels mutually looking towards each other; that which is to be the central (plexus choroides) being mere- ly a mesh of vessels looking to that which is to be peripheral, (pia mater.) The first portions of newly deposited cerebral matter form the barrier between these extremities, which continue to be more widely parted as the process of developement advances. This membrane is then more vascular than at any subsequent period. The cerebral matter is first deposited soft, and firmly adherent to these vessels, which are ramified in every di- rection through its substance. It becomes firmer afterwards and less vascular the longer the period from deposition. Hence the two surfaces, the outer and inner, are much softer and more pulpy, and more firmly attached to the vessels, than the intermediate deep matter. Tiedemann appears to regard the process of developement as proceeding from the centre to the circumference. This is cor- rect, but not in the exact sense in wliich he under-

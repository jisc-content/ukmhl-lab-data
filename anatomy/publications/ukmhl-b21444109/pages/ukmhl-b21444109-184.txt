GENERAL ANATOMY. 162 The collections denominated lunihar abscess de- pend either on disease of the vertebrae, generally of an inflammatory natui'e, or on slow inflammation of the lumbar cellular tissue and lymphatic glands. The circumstance on which Mr Hunter went, in considering these collections to be indeiJendent of inflammation, was the absence of pain as the first symptom. In this, however, I believe that accu- rate observer was mistaken. In every one of the cases of disease to which he refers as examples, more or less pain is invariably felt in the course, if not from the first date of the complaints. Two circumstances, indeed, distinguish this sort of pain. It is neither severe nor uninterrupted, and may be so moderate as not to attract the attention of the patient, or form a serious subject of complaint. But even admitting the statement of ]\Ir Hunter, that the sensation of pain is not the first, it is doubtless too limited a view of the inflammatory process to imagine, that this can never exist miless when the sensation is the first symptom. In some of the textures, especially mucous membrane, we know that inflammation may be established for some time without much attendant pain. In others, especially the serous membranes, inflamma- tion approaches so slowly and imperceptibly, that both lymph and purulent matter may be effiised before the existence of the disease is suspected. For these and similar reasons it has become re- quisite to admit the existence of a slow insidious form of inflammation termed chronic, correspond-

Though effected chiefly by attrition, it is much facilitated by the use of acid substances, and by those states of the stomach and alimentary canal which favour the formation of acid. Another form of the same destruction may take place in the corresponding sides of two teeth which are too closely implanted together. The mutual pressure exercised during the process of mastication appears to be the first cause of this. After it is once established, it de- stroys first the enamel, and then the bone of the tooth, causing caries in the latter, which become blue or black, and is gradually excavated into a hole. The most frequent cause of disease of the teeth, however, is inflammation of their internal pulp. This, which is attended by intense pain, by pro- gressively destroying the membrane, impairs the nutrition of the tooth, which becomes carious in the bony pith, while the enamel cracks, and is cast off in the form of concave scales or crusts. The â€¢bony part thus exposed proceeds still more rapidly to destruction. It becomes excavated, breaks down, and at length is expelled in fragments. Inflammation of the membrane of the alveolar cavities also, by injuring the connecting vessels, may cause carious destruction of the teeth. But it is generally combined with more or less affec- tion of the pulp. In the rachitic its destruction causes the developement of the teeth to be checked, rendering the individual toothless.

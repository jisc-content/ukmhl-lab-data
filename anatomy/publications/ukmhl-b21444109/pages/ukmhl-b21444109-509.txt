487 MUSCULAR TISSUE. several animal substances. It is traversed by ar- teries and veins of various size ; nervous twigs are observed to pass into it; it is often covered by dense whitish membranous folds (fascia,) or by serous or mucous membranes, all which will be examined afterwards ; and it is found to con- tain a large proportion of filamentous tissue. But it is distinguished by consisting of numerous fibres disposed parallel to each other, and which may be separated in the same manner by proper means. The appearance, arrangement, and cha- racters of these fibres demand particular notice. According to Prochaska, muscle in all parts of the body may be resolved, by careful dissection, into fibres of great delicacy, as minute as silk-fila- ments, but pretty uniform in shape, general ap- pearance, and dimensions. Their diameter ap- pears not to exceed the 40^0 part of an inch, whatever be their length. They seem all more or less flattened or angular, and appear to be solid diaphanous filaments. Prochaska appears not to doubt that these muscular threads (Jila carnea) are incapable of further division ; and he therefore terms them 'primary muscular fibres. The microscopical examination of the atomic constitution of the muscular filament, which was first attempted by Lewenhoeck,and afterwards pro- secuted by Delia Torre, Fontana, Monro, and Pro- chaska, has been recently revived M. Bauer, the indefatigable assistant of Sir E. Home. From the observations of this accurate inquirer, each

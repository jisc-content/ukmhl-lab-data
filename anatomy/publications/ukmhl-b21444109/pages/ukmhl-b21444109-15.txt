PREFACE. xi though I refer to the cases of Mojon and Cover- celli, I confess that I had at the time some doubts regarding the connection between existence of the tumour and the epileptic motions. Since that sheet was printed I met with the remarkable case of Dr Short, * which has tended to remove these doubts ; and I have elsewhere offered a conjecture on the connection between these tumours and the sensation called ej)ile2)tic aura. This it was unne- cessary to notice, had not my friend, Mr William Wood, attaching to the conjecture more value than it really merited, resumed with his usual acuteness the investigation of a subject, on which he was the first to communicate exact information. The monograph of Mr Wood, published in the third volume of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, is now not only the fullest, but the best account of the neuromatic tubercle ; and had it been composed previous to the sheet in which the account in the present volume is contained, would have enabled me to give a much better description of that disease. To the peculiar disease of the intestinal mucous membrane in children described by Dr Crampton, I have not assigned a separate place in the text, from difficulty of understanding its exact nature. * Medical Essays and Observations, Vol. iv. p. 410.

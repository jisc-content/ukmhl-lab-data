ARTEliY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 103 In most cases, however, of longitudinal or oblique wounds, and in all cases of partial transverse wounds, the process is different. Supposing the external opening to be closed, which it sooner or later is, the blood from the wounded artery is ex- tensively injected into the sheath, where its coa- gulation prevents as before further effusion. Though inflammation takes place, however, and l3anph is effused, it is insufficient to unite perma- nently the divided edges. Either the wound is never thoroughly united, or at a period after its infliction, varying according to its extent and di- rection, and according to the size of the artery and its distance from the heart, its edges are rent asunder by the incessant impulse. (Jones, Hodgson, Guthrie.) Blood continues from time to time to escape into the sheath, which it distends into a sac, and in which it is deposited in successive layers. In this manner is formed a pulsating tumour, which has been termed false, spurious, or bastard aneurism. (Monro Primus.) If the injection is extensive, so as to cause a diffuse swelling, spread- ing to some distance along the limb, the disease is termed diffuse aneurism. If it is more limited, distends the sheath into a globular sac, and as- sumes the appearance of the usual aneurismal tu- mour, then it is termed circumscribed aneurism. This is the sort of aneurism which takes place when the brachial artery is opened, instead of the vein at the bend of the arm; (William Cowper, Macgill, Monro Primus^ &c.) and it is not uncom-

MUSCULAR TISSUE. this head, I refer to the section on Diffuse Inflam- mation of the CeUular Membrane. (3. Carditis.—Another example of inflammation of muscular tissue is presented in that of the heart. The testimony of Dr Baillie shows that this is a rare disease, and is almost never primary, but the result of inflammation of the pericardium, from which it spreads to the filamentous tissue, and partly to the muscular fibres of the organ. The general accuracy of this statement is confirmed by Laennec, who contends, that though partial in- flammation in minute spots is not uncommon, yet general inflammation of the cardiac substance, either acute or chronic, is a thing almost unknown in the records of medicine. The cases adduced by Corvisart he regards as examples of pericar- ditis ; and the same may be said of those of Dr Davis.* The possibility of the fact, nevertheless, he admits on the evidence of the case of Meckel.f Stronger proof he might have found in a case by Mr Stanley, in which the cut substance of the heart was exceedingly dark-coloured from injec- tion of the capillaries ; the fibres were soft, loose, easily separable, and compressible between the fingers, while sections of each ventricle exhibited numerous small distinct collections of dark-colour- ed purulent matter among the muscular fasciculi, —some deep, approaching the cavity of the ven- tricle, others superficial, raising the pericardium. * Inquiry into the Symptoms, &c. of Cai'ditis.

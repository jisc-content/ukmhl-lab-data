ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 95 The most ordinary effect of calcareous incrus- tation, when extensive, is to induce chronic in- flammation and ulceration of the arterial tissue. The earthy matter operates as a foreign body, and by constant irritation destroys the vitality of the inner membrane, which exfoliates, and inflames the proper tissue, which is then eroded. In this state the occasional application of a slight force may be followed by more or less laceration of theÂ°pro- per coat. In arteries covered by a filamentous sheath, the blood thus discharged is injected into the sheath, which is then distended into a sphe- rical sac situate more or less on one side of the vessel. This forms the disease described as true aneurism by Scarpa. In arteries not supplied with filamentous sheath, as in the brain, the blood escapes freely, and may by its quantity induce fatal compression of that organ. (Blane, Hodgson, Bouil- laud, and Serres.) The calcareous deposition renders the arterial tube so brittle, that the application of a ligature invariably cracks it, prevents the usual process of adhesion, and is generally succeeded by ulceration and hemorrhage. In persons advanced in life cal- careous deposition in the arteries of the lower ex- tremities is a cause not unfrequent of mortification of the toes, feet, and legs, generally terminating fatally. (Cowper, Naish, and Pott.) 4. Atheromatous Deposition. This term has been applied to a semifluid or cheesy opaque substance, which is not unfrequently found between the in-

We answer, it may do no harm ; but as it can communicate no infor- mation, and explain no difficulties, it is at least a superfluous labour to augment the confusion of a department of anatomy not very easy by useless and antiquated names, which live only to pro- claim their absurdity, and the impropriety of find- ing them there. Knowledge in the present day, to be worth the labour of acquisition, ought to be accurate; and books which are to be the means of conveying this knowledge ought to contain no superfluous or erroneous information. As little to be approved is the application of the term nervous matter to the substance of the brain, because it implies the identity of this substance with that of the nervous tissue. It is not impro- bable that this may be the case; but, in the meantime, as it requires yet to be proved, we conceive it more judicious to consider the sub- stance of the brain as quite distinct from that of the nervous chords. For these reasons, the co- gency of which I presume cannot be denied, I propose to abandon entirely the terms hitherto used by anatomists when speaking of the brain, and I shall on all occasions consider it as a pecu- liar substance under the name of brain, cerebral substance, or cerebral matter. No organ has been examined by so many ana- tomists, with such frequency, and with so much

332 GENERAL ANATOMY. fore, which forms the inner or central part of the cylindroid process, is continuous, or connected with the upper surface of the central band of the organ ; and if the terms of origin or derivation be admitted, may be said to be derived from it; while the thin white plate which is roUed over the gray band, and gives the hippocampus its cy- lindrical figure, is connected with the under sur- face of the same central band, or that part which the usual nomenclature styles the vault (fornix) of the brain. Such, as nearly as language can represent, is the configuration of the cylindroid process,â€”an object which it is impossible to know too accu- rately, if we reflect that it forms the entire outer border of the great communication between the convoluted and figurate surfaces of the^ brain. If, by the method now described, a clear idea of this disposition is not communicated, it is expe- dient to use another contrivance, which I have rarely found to fail in demonstrating the facts which I wish to impress. Let a brain, divested of its membranes, be inverted ; and when the opening behind the outer margin of the cerebral limbs has been exposed, let a deep transverse in- cision between the feet of the hippocampus of each side be made. This incision must not touch the cylindroid process, but going deep into the substance of the organ, will detach the whole of that part which contains the several objects of the figurate surface from the anterior part of the

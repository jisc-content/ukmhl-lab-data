110 GENERAL ANATOMY. CHAPTER V. VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE, OXs^'. (Vcnci-^Tissu veneux.) Section L The structure of the tubular canals, termed veins, lias been much less examined by anatomists than that of the arteries. Some incidental obser- vations in the writings of Willis, Glass, and CHf- ton Wintringham, comprise all that was publish- ed regarding them previous to the short account of Haller. Since that time they have been described with variovis degrees of minuteness and accuracy by John Hunter, Bichat, Magendie, Gordon, Marx,* and Meckel. In the following account the facts collected by these observers have been compared with the appearance and visible organization pre- sented by veins in different parts of the human body. The veins are membranous tubes extending be- tween the riglit side or pulmonary division of the heart and the different organs in which their mi- nute branches are ramified. Every venous tube greater than one line in dia- meter consists of three kinds of distinct substance. * Diatribe Anatomico-physiologica de structura atque vita venarum. Caroliruhae, 1819' 4

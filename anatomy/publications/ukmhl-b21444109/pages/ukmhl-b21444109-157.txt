SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 135 ties since his time, concluded, chiefly from the phe- nomena of injections, sometimes from microscopi- cal observation, and where these failed, from the obscure and uncertain evidence of analogy, that an artery traced to its last or minute divisions will be found to terminate in one or other of the following modes. 1*^, Either directly in a red vein or veins ; ^d, in excreting ducts, as in the lacrymal and salivary glands, the kidney, liver, and pancreas, the female breast, and the testicle of the male; in exhalants, as in the skin, in the membranes of cavities, (serous membranes,) the cavities of the brain, the chambers of the eye, the filamentous tissue, the adipose cells, the pulmo- nary vesicles, and mucous surfaces and their fol- licular glands; ^th, in smaller vessels, for instance lymphatics; and, bth, in the colourless artery ; {arteria non rubra.) * A similar application of the same facts has as- signed to the veins a mode of origin not unlike. If, therefore, we admit the definition given by Bi- chat, it follows that the capillary system con- sists, 1*^, of minute arteries communicating with veins ; 2<i, of excreting ducts ; 3f/, of exhalants ; and, ^th, of minute arteries or veins containing a colourless portion of the blood. It is obvious, however, that it is absurd to say that the system of capillary vessels at once comprehends and gives origin to the excretories and exhalants. In other respects the whole of this theory, for little of it is * Elementa Physiologise, Lib. i. sect. 1. p. 22-29.

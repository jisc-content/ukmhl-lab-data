510 GENERAL ANATOMY. Of tlie white fibrous tissues one of the most important is that denominated fascia. Consisting in intimate structure of long fibrous threads placed in parallel juxtaposition, sometimes obliquely in- terwoven and closely connected by filamentous tissue, it forms a whitish membranous web, vari- able in breadth, of some thickness and great strength. Fascia is perhaps, not excepting the skin, the most extensively distributed texture of membranous form in the animal body. It not only covers, if not the whole, at least by far the greatest part of the muscles of the trunk and each limb, but it sends round each muscle pro- ductions by which it is invested and supported, and even penetrates by minute slips into the sub- stance of individual muscles. Of several of the larger muscles it connects the component parts, as is seen in the recti abdominis; to many it affords points of origin or insertion ; and to all it furnishes more or less investment and support. Most of the tendons, especially the flexor and ex- tensor tendons, are enclosed by it; and their syno- vial sheaths derive from it their exterior covering. At the extremities of the bones it is connected with the ligaments and periosteum, with which it is closely interwoven ; and it forms a general in- vestment to the articular apparatus. Though fascia may thus be viewed as one membranous web consisting of many parts all directly connected with each other, it is the prac- tice of anatomists to distinguish its divisions ac- cording to the region which they occupy. Thus

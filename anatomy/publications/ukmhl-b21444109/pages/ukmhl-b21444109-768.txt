GENERAL ANATOMY. 744 of coiitiguous and corresponding parts and sur- faces. From their free surfaces is secreted a fluid containing a very small portion of albumen, (Hew- son, * Bostock, f) which is greatly augmented dur- ing the state of disease. The mode of developement of the pellucid mem- branes is not very well ascertained. The investiga- tions regarding organogenesy by Oken, Meckel, and Tiedemann, to which I have occasion so fre- quently to allude, disclose facts which induce Meckel to hazard the opinion that some of them are not at all times shut sacs. I have some rea- son to doubt, however, whether the fact which he adduces for this purpose necessarily implies the open condition of the pericardium and the pe- ritonaeum. In the case of the former the deve- lopement of the heart proceeds from the basis ge- nerally, without affecting the integrity of the in- vesting membrane. In the case of the latter there is more reason to believe, that at the navel at least the peritonaeum is either open, or is con- tinuous with the viteUar membrane. In the foetus the serous membranes are so thin, that they are much more transparent than in the adult. In small animals also, they are more trans- parent than in large, and in cold-blooded animals than in the mammiferous. Of some also the disposi- tion varies at different periods.

BRAIN. 315 other lobes; nor yet is their direction different from each other. The plates at its outer margin are the largest, as they extend the whole length from the marginal furrow to the end of the slen- der lobe, at which, however, they are contracted to a narrow point. The next set are shorter, and are more contracted or acuminated at their poste- rior end, where they are contiguous to the al- monds or tonsils. The third and last set are the shortest, and are more twisted down, as it were, next the almonds. These contracted or acumi- nated ends of the cerebellic plates are named (code) tails by Malacarne. The disposition now described renders the pos- terior corner of the biventral lobe very pointed, and its margin very concave; and between this margin and the parts which occupy the valley is placed a group of plates somewhat convex, round- ed, and disposed also in a peculiar manner. This group Malacarne names the tonsil, or tonsils, {tonsille,) * a term which Reil, regarding it synoni- mous with amygdalce, renders literally almonds, (Die Mandeln,) the spinal lobule of Dr Gordon. If the cerebellum be examined before the head of the spinal chord is cut from the protuberance, the inner margin of the almond will be found conti- guous to the oval eminence {corpus olivare,) and even pressed by it. It is best, however, to exa- mine the almonds after the chord (medulla ohlon- * Encefolotomia, Articoloix.

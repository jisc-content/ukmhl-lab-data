VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 123 of veins can be said to be exactly equal to that of the arteries, are in the stomach, in the intestinal canal, in the spleen, in the kidneys, in the testicles, and in the ovaries. 2. In the extremities and in the external re- gions of the trunk we find, in addition to the con- comitant veins, an external layer of venous tubes immediately beneath the skin, (vents subter cutem disperscB, Pliny.) These subcutaneous or super- ficial veins do not correspond to any artery; but as they are chiefly destined to convey the blood from the skin and other superficial parts, they open into the deep-seated veins. Thus in the case of the basilic and cephalic, two superficial veins of the arm, the former, after passing the bicipital fascia, forms in the sheath the brachial vein ; and becoming the axillary in the axilla re- ceives the latter vessel. In the same manner, the saphena, (ipXs-^/ ffaipaiv/jg, vena manifesta,) the su- perficial vein of the leg, passes through the falci- form process of the fascia lata to join the femoral vein. From this it results that the venous canals are on the whole more numerous than the arterial. In a few situations only a single vein corresponds to two arteries, as in the penis, the clitoris, the gall-bladder, and the umbilical chord. Often also in the renal capsules and the kidneys two or more arteries have only one corresponding vein. In such circumstances the vein is always large and capacious. It has been generally stated that the calibre

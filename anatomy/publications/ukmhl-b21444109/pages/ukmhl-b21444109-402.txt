GENERAL ANATOMY. 380 substance of the organ in which it is effused. The softened portion is then generally brown, or a wine- lee-colour ; but if a considerable time has elapsed after effusion, it may be of a dirty or ashy-colour, tending to green, and not unlike softened bread. 3. It may either accompany r follow the process which terminates in hydrocephalic effusion. It is then of a milk-white colour. (Rostan, Lallemand.) 4. It may take place in the cerebral substance sur- rounding tumours, (Meckel, Blane, Powell, &c.) when its colour varies from pale-red, to green, yel- low, and brown. From these facts it may be inferred, that soft- ening or pulpy disorganization of the brain is not so much a proper disease as the effect of a mor- bid process, which takes place in different condi- tions of the brain. When it occurs in the first manner it is the re- sult of a species of difiuse inflammation, in which there is no tendency to limit the action of the dis- ease by the effusion of lymph, or the formation of a vascular cyst. This is well illustrated in those cases recorded by Morgagni, in which parts of the brain had become yellowish or greenish, with much diminution of consistence, (Epist. iii. 2. ix. 20. XXV. 10. lii. 23.); and in the eighth de- lineation of Dr Hooper, (p. 23.) In cases of this description a sero-albuminous or semi-purulent fluid is infiltrated into the cerebral substance, por- tions of which are thus separated and detached from each other. The process is allied to in-

588 GENERAL ANATOMY. forming a structure like the pile of velvet. This is easily demonstrated by maceration first in nitric acid, and then in water. The free or smooth sur- face is covered by a thin fold of synovial mem- brane, which comes off in pieces during macera- tion. The existence of this, though recently de- nied by Gordon, was admitted by William Hun- ter, and may be demonstrated either by boiling, maceration, or the phenomena of inflammation, under which it is sensibly thickened. All other cartilages are enveloped, unless where they are attached to bones, by a fibrous membrane, which has been therefore named jiericJiondrium. The existence of this may be demonstrated by dissec- tion, and also by boiling, which makes it peel off in crisped flakes. The chemical properties of cartilage have not been accurately examined. Boiling shows that it contains gelatine; but as a good deal of the matter is undissolved, it must be concluded also that it is under some modification, or united with some other principle, perhaps albumen. Immer- sion in nitric acid or boiling fluids induces crispa- tion, and it dries hard and semitransparent like horn. Section II. Cartilage is subject to inflammation, which in the chronic form passes into ulceration or ero- sion,â€”an affection common in the articular carti- lages of the thigh-bone and tibia.^ In this state cartilage becomes reddish or vas-

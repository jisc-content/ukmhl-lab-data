TENDON. 503 8. Accidental productions and tumours.â€”Mus- cular structure is liable to tubercular deposition, to scirrho-carcinoma, to lardaceous degeneration, (ce- roma) to encephaloid tumours, and to the mela- notic deposit, (CuUen.) Serous cysts (hygroma) are said to be rare ; but the solitary hydatid (cys- ticercus cellulosce) is not uncommon. * The lat- ter especially has been seen in the trape%ius, ser- ratus posticus, psoas, iliacus, glutaeus, and other large muscles, (Werner, Rudolphi,) and in the heart by Morgagni, (xxi. 4.) Portal, and Price. CHAPTER XV. Section I. Sinew, Tendon, Tendo. Sinew or tendon was united by Bichat with ligament, fascia, aponeurosis, and periosteum, un- der the general name of fibrous system; and the substance of this arrangement has been adopted by Gordon, Meckel, and Beclard. I am inclined, however, from personal observation, to regard tendon as essentially distinct, at least in the pre- sent state of knowledge, from these substances. Examined anatomically, it does not bear a very close resemblance to any of them, and in its known chemical properties, it is considerably dif- ferent. The appearance of this substance must be fa- * Bremser, Traite Zoologique^ xi. p. 280.

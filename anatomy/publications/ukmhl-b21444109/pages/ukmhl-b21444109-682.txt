GENERAL ANATOMY. 658 more is known. They are covered by a true epidermis. In the stomach, duodenum, and ileum, this mem- brane is collected into folds or plaits, which have received in the former situation the name of rugcB or wrinkles, and in the latter the name of plictE or folds, and valmilce conniventes or winking valves. In the vagina also are transverse rugce, which in like manner are folds or duplicatures of its mucous membrane. Those of the oesophagus are longitudinal, and have been described by Bleuland. In the tracheo-bronchial membrane, and in the membranous and spongy portions of the urethra, we find them in the shape of mi- nute plaits or wrinkles in the long direction of their respective tubes, but rarely of much length. These folds or plaits are quite peculiar to the mu- cous membranes ; and the object of them appears to be to increase the extent of surface, and to al- low the membrane to undergo considerable occa- sional distension. In certain points, where a communication is ob- served between the general mucous surface and the cavities or recesses of particular regions, ana- tomists have not demonstrated a mucous mem- brane, but have inferred its existence as a con- tinuation of the general surface. In the tympa- nal cavity to which the Eustachian tube leads, the existence of a mucous or fibro-mucous mem- brane is rather presumed from analogy than proved by actual observation. We know that, where the biliary and pancreatic ducts enter the duo-

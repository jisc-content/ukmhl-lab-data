BONE. 551 is, that they are formed invariably in the sub- stance of fibrous organs, as tendons in the case of the knee-pan and the sesamoid bones of the gemelli, tibialis posticus, and peronceus I.; or ligaments in the case of those situate between the metacarpo- phalangeal and metatarso-phalangeal articulations. With this peculiarity their mode of ossification corresponds. At first albuminous or fibro-albu- minous, in process of time they are penetrated by calcareous matter, and present an osseous tex- ture, which, however, is much less firm than that of genuine bones. The period at which this de- position commences and is completed varies in dif- ferent individuals ; and hence, scarcely in any two persons of the same age is thi»'^^piber of sesamoid bones the same. , Though tl^^aitella may be os- sified at the 20th year, the minute sesamoid bones are sometimes not formed before the 30th or even the 40th. In the patella, when ossified, we find a medullary organ. But it is uncertain whether the others acquire this mark of osseous character. These bones resemble the epiphyses in uniting, when divided, by fibro-albuminous matter. Section II. Osteitis; Infiammatio.—Though all practical authors admit that bones may be inflamed either spontaneously, or in consequence of injury, yet it is remarkable that none have communicated any

Of this the result has been, more accu- rate distinction of diseases formerly confounded, fuller and more precise information regarding those which were imperfectly known, and an ex- traordinary accumulation of matter on all topics. In some instances the boundaries of the science have been extended; in others, departments al- ready known have been more diligently explor- ed ; and if the result has not at all times been absolute discovery, some advantage has accrued from the correction or the modification of former statements. The advantage to the science at large has ne- vertheless been accompanied with great and in- creasing inconvenience to the student.

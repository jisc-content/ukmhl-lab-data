GENERAL ANATOMY. 320 nuosity, which is formed chiefly by a part of the brain, remarkable in appearance and organization. This, which was named by the ancient anatomists the smooth or polished body (ff&ijM/a riKKosihg, cor- pus Icsve) * to distinguish it from those surfaces which were formed by a cutting instrument, ap- pears in the form of white fibrous matter, passing transversely between the hemispheres ; but is also marked by certain longitudinal lines, first correct- ly represented by Vicq-D'Azyr. The most con- spicuous of these is that which lies exactly in the middle plane, and which is formed by the meet- ing of the transverse fibres, of which this body, termed middle or central hand, {mesolohe of Chaussier, the beam (der Ball<en) of Reil,) f con- sists. These fibres, which issue like white pa- rallel lines, exceedingly minute, from the substance of the hemispheres, either stop suddenly, or change * This is the literal translation and the true meaning of the term used by the Alexandrian school. The name corpus callosum, which is adopted by modern anatomists, is a bad translation made at the revival of literature. In defence of the error, Vicq-D'Azyr contradicts nature by the asser- tion, that this is somewhat harder or firmer than the other parts of the brain. " Cette production a plus de consist- ence que le reste du cerveau.â€”Ce corps un peu plus dur que le reste de la substance blanche du cerveau." Of* many brains examined, certainly with a different object than to prove the learning or ignorance of the translators of the Greek physicians, I never could perceive any difference in the consistence of this and other parts of the brain. f Archiv. fiir die Physiologic.

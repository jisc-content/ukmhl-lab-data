SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 153 rather than at the individual bodies ; the other in ascribing contraction to the elasticity and muscu- lar action of the contiguous parts rather than to a change in the state of the granulations. These circumstances are certainly useful accessory means; but they must not be regarded as the primary and essential cause. Perhaps also some slight differ- ences take place in the time in which contraction occurs, and the extent to which it proceeds, accord- ing to the nature of the granulating surface, and the relation which the production of the granulat- ing eminences bears to the part to be restored. The general phenomena of the process appear to be the following. -After the granulating eminence or eminences have been formed, and have united with the con- tiguous ones, the uninterrupted action of their new capillaries continues to effuse lymph as a basis for fresh granulations, and to give out vas- cular or capillary prolongations, in order to orga- nize them. Meanwhile the vessels of the granulat- ing eminences near the edges of the surface begin to diminish in size; and as they diminish the emi- nences themselves become less red and smaller, but more firm. At length, as the eminences be- come covered with the membrane of cicatrization, they appear to have diminished so much that little inequality can be recognized, the redness is sensibly diminished, and the whole appears as if it were becoming quite as solid or firm as the con- tiguous parts. If in this part of the process a granulating surface be injected, the vessels which

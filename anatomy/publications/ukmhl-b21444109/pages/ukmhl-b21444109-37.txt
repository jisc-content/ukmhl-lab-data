DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 1? general heads of vascular, nervous, fibrous, mus- cular, horny, or parenchymatous systems. The result of this arrangement is to diminish the num- ber of organic systems from twenty-one to eleven, one of which, the erectile, comprehending the pe- culiar structure of the cavernous body, the clito- ris, the nipple, and the spleen, is not found in the original arrangement of Bichat, but has been add- ed by MM. Dupuytren and Richerand. A less neat and elegant arrangement is that given by Hippolytus Cloquet, Avho admits in the human body the following fifteen tissues : 1. The cellular; 2. The membranous ; 3. The vascular, in- cluding blood-vessels, and lymphatics; 4. Bone ; 5. Cartilage; 6. Fibro-cartilage ; 7- Ligament; 8. Muscle; 9- Tendon ; 10. Aponeurosis, or fascia ; 11. Nerve ; 12. Glandular structure ; 13. Follicle ; 14. Lymphatic ganglion, or gland ; 15. The Vis- cera. It is evident that the last mentioned term is greatly too vague, and that the structure which it is intended to denote may be either united with several of those already noticed, or is so different or opposite in different situations, that admitting it as a separate tissue becomes of no use what- ever in a correct classification. Not unlike to the arrangementof MM. Richerand and Dupuytren is that proposed by John Frederic Meckel, who looked on the arrangement of Bichat as too detailed, and embarrassed with too many and minute distinctions. According to this ana- tomist, the medullary system should be united B

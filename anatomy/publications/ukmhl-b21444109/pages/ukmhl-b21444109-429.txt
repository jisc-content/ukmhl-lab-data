BRAIN. 407 gagni, treading in the steps of Bonetus, justly- remarked, that either bloody effusion, or the ca- verns formed by it, are found almost always in the striated bodies, or in the optic thalami, or in both, while the anterior part of the hemisphere was very rarely, and the posterior part almost never affected. * The general accuracy of this conclusion is in some degree confirmed by modern observation, which, in a majority of cases, has found the striated and optic bodies diseased. Ro- choux particularly shows, that of forty-one cases of bloody effusion terminating fatally, twenty-four were found in the corpus striatum, two in the optic thalamus, one in the corpus striatum and optic thalamus, and one beneath the corpus stria- ttim ; while only thirteen, not more than one-half, were found in other parts of the brain. The reason of this is to be found in the anatomical re- lations of this part of the brain. Near the be- ginning of the fissure of Sylvius is situate the white perforated spot of Vicq-d'Azyr (" substance blanche que j'appelle perforee^) Through these orifices the Sylvian or middle artery of the brain, which lies in the fissure, transmits a great num- ber of arteries of various sizes into the substance of the brain, and through the cerebral nucleus (corpus striatum,) which lies immediately over this perforated spot. This arrangement renders the striated body, or rather the striated nucleus, the most vascular part of the whole organ, and * Epistola iii. 18.

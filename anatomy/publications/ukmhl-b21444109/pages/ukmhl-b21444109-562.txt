540 GENERAL ANATOMY. which, however, is thinner and more transparent than the margin or circumference.â€”(Howship.) Between thirteen weeks and four months the cavities in tlie jelly-like cartilaginous matter re- ceives injection. The membranes of the head are highly vascular, transmitting their vessels through the intervals of the osseous rays, which are occupied abundantly by stiff, glairy, colourless mucilaginous fluid. In the seventh month, the bony cylinder of the thigh-bone and its epiphyses contain canals per- ceptible to the microscope. In the head, the bones are proceeding to completion ; the pericra- nium and dura mater are highly vascular ; and a quantity of reddish semitransparent jelly between the scalp and the scull, which contained nume- rous minute vessels, Mr Howship regards as the loose cellular state of the foetal pericranium. This is, however, doubtful. The cylindrical bones have at this period no medullary cavity, but present in their interior a loose bony texture. Between the seventh and eighth months, in a foe- tus ten inches long, I find the humerus consisting of acylinderof bone placed between two brownish firm jelly-like masses, which correspond to the epiphy- ses, enclosed by periosteum, which adheres loosely by means of filamentous and vascular productions. The radius is a thin bony rod, also between two jelly-like epiphyses. The ulna is still thinner, more slender and flexible, and even compressible. The interosseous ligament is a continuous dupli-

240 GENERAL ANATOMY. Since the arguments which have been adduced against the absorbent power of the lymphatic ves- sels by Mayer, Magendie, and others, their influ- ence either in the production of dropsy, or in re- moving it, seems to be very doubtful. How far can they be admitted to explain the process of ulcerative absorption so ingeniously contrived and ably maintained by John Hunter ? and what share can they be supposed to possess in the removal of other matters, either proper or foi'eign to the system, as that pathologist be- lieved ?

This is the proper place to consider the struc- ture of those bodies which are in common language termed kernels, to which anatomists have applied the name of lymphatic glands, and the French anatomists have more recently given that of lym- phatic ganglions.

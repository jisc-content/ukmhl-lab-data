FILAMENTOUS OK CELLULAR TISSUE. 39 minates in phlegmonic suppuration and granula- tion. When recovery takes place after suppuration and sloughing of the cellular tissue, it is affected partly by direct adhesion taking place between the muscles, or their cellular substance, partly by the formation of new cellular tissue, similar to the new membranes formed on the serous surfaces. The former is the cause of the stiffness, immobility, and condensation of parts after this inflammation has taken place. In some instances the circumscribed, or limited, and the siweading forms of inflammation may be combined. The latter proceeds at one part of the affected tissue ; while the limited, with lymphy exudation and adhesion takes place at another. This appears to be the variety of those tedious cases in which the disease is prolonged for weeks, and the patient either recovers, or ultimately dies hectic. Diffuse inflammation may occur in any part of the filamentous tissue of the whole body, and may affect either the subcutaneous and superficial, or the intermuscular and deep-seated layer. But the regions in which it is most commonly observed, may be enumerated in the following order:â€” a. The neck and throat.

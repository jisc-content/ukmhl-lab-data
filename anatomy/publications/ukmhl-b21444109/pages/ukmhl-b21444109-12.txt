viii PREFACE. thods in ordinary use. Without pretending to determine the comparative merits of the methods of Baillie, Conradi, Meckel, and Cruveilhier, each of which has peculiar advantages, I may be per- mitted to observe, that the first object in tracing the progress and effects of pathological processes is to fix the boundary between what is sound and what is morbid, and that every morbid process always bears some relation to the proper charac- ters of the texture in a sound state. For these reasons I have chosen as the basis of arrangement the distinctions of the component tissues of the animal body, as derived from the similitude and difference of their anatomical characters ; and though the advantages of this method have been recognized by John Hunter, Carmichael Smyth, Bichat, Dr Thomson, and Beclard, I am not aware that any complete system of pathological anatomy has been hitherto constructed according to its principles. The present attempt is, 1 believe, the first instance in which it has been carried to the length of a full though elementary treatise. It is almost superfluous to enter into any de- tailed account of the principles on which this work is composed. In describing both the sound and morbid states of the different organic tissues, I have in general indicated the sources of my infor-

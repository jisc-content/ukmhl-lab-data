Lappen, R-.); and those separated by- furrows of less depth are named lobules, {lohetti, M. Lappchen, R.) In some situations the lobules present divisions formed by furrows of less depth, between which the groups of plates are of greater or less size. To such clusters Malacarne gives the name of laminar leaflets, (foglietti laminosi.)* Each hemispherical surface consists of five lobes. 1. The anterior-upper. 2. The posterior-upper. 3. The posterior-lower. 4. The slender, rarely exceeding three lines in breadth. 5. The two-bel- lied or biventral. The two first belong to the up- per or flat hemispherical surface ; the three latter to the lower or convex hemispherical surface. Be- sides these, a sixth lobe may be mentioned as com- mon to the two hemispheres. It is situate on the mesial plane of the upper surface, between the an- terior end of the middle line {raffe,) and the mid- dle or apex of the semilunar fissure. This situa- tion is not an improper reason for the name by which Malacarne has distinguished it,â€”the cen- tral lobe. In the bottom of the purse-like notch we find many bundles or clusters of plates, which unite the posterior lobes of the upper and lower sur- faces to those of the opposite hemisphere. These Malacarne names transmrse laminar chords {cor- * Encefalotomia nuova, &c., Parte iii. Articolo i. No. 13.

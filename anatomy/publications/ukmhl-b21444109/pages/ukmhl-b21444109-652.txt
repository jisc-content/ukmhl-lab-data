GENERAL ANATOMY. 628 He subsequently comes to the conclusion, that on the sur- face of the skin (corion) lie five membranes, the outermost of which is cuticle, the next two-fold is rete mucosim, and the fourth is the first vascular membrane in which the small- pox pustules are chiefly seated. From these facts and observations, as well as those which it has occurred to myself to make, the following conclusions may be drawn:â€” The phlyclidium or pustule of small-pox consists of a cuta- neous inflammation, which may produce, 1*^, Secretion of puriform fluid without permanent injury or destruction of the corion. In lenticular chicken-pox, and distinct small-pox, there is no doubt that though suppura- tion takes place from the cuticular surface of the corion, it is not necessarily connected with destruction or ulceration of that membrane. 2d, Suppurative ulceration of the corion. In conoidal chicken-pox, in some instances of distinct small-pox, and in many instances of small-pox partially or wholly confluent, each pock goes on to ulceration of the corion. It does not appear that the pock slough described by Hunter is present in every case. It is admitted by Adams to be wanting in the vesicular small-pox, which appear after cow-pox, and in some other occasions. Sd, Death of numerous spots of the corion constituting sloughs. In some cases of distinct small-pox this has been observed; but it is most frequent in the confluent eruption. It then appears in the form of a white circular patch lying at the bottom of each pock. Mh, Along with sloughs at individual points, an extensive spreading redness of the skin rapidly terminating in sloughs of irregular shape and limits not unfrequently occurs in cer- tain bad forms of variolous eruption. Oriental plague I place among the examples of pustular cutaneous inflammation, because the carbuncle to which its poison gives rise, is, I conceive, an instance of punctuate in- flammation of the corion. I am aware that Willan, and after

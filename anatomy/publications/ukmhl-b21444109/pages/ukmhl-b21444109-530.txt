508 GENERAL ANATOMY. to indicate that albuminous matter forms its chief chemical principle. As to their mechanical shape, the ligaments are divided by Bichat into two sorts ; those in regu- lar and those in irregular bundles. The former comprehends all the distinct clusters of ligamen- tous structure, which sometimes in a cylindrical, sometimes in a flattened shape, connect the arti- culating ends of bones, and form the lateral liga- ments of the various articulations. The latter consists of those loose parcels of ligamentous fibres which are found in various regions of the skele- ton, not in regular cylindrical or longitudinal bands, but irregularly connecting bones not ad- mitting of articular motion; for instance at the symphysis pubis and the sacro-iliac junction. The division of Beclard into articular, non-articular, and mixed, is more comprehensive and more natu- ral. The first are those which connect the arti- cular extremities of different bones. The second are those which, attached to different parts of the same bone, convert notches into foramina, as in the orbitar arch and the supra-scapular hollow, or close openings, and give attachment to muscles, as the obturator ligament. The last are those which, like the sacro-ischiatic or the interosseous liga- ments of the fore-arm and leg, connect bones sus- ceptible of little or no motion, and especially give at- tachment to muscles. The two latter species of liga- ments approach closely in their characters, physical and anatomical, to periosteum, and are probably to be regarded as modifications of this membrane.

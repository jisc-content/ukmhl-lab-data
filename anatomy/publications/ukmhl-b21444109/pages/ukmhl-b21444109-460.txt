This change depends on chronic injection of those capillaries of the vascular membrane {pia meninx) which are distributed through the brain. 8. Sclerencephalia. Induration of the brain.â€” That the brain may acquire an unnatural degree of firmness, and perhaps of density, is well established from the observations of Morgagni, Meckel, Gre- ding, Haslam, Marshall, Serres, Lallemand, Ler- minier, PinelJun. Bouillaud and Gaudet. Instead of the usual compressible elastic character which it presents in the sound state, it may become like co- agulated or boiled albunien, or may approach in consistence to that of the brain which has been immersed in strong alcohol or dilute acid. From the facts hitherto collected, this induration appears to be of two kinds, according as it takes place in a shorter or longer period. ci. According to the facts collected by M. Bou- iUaud, a general induration of the brain may take place within ten or fifteen days before death, with more or less redness and injection of the cerebral substance. By M. Gaudet this change is conceived to be one of the material causes of ataxic (typhoid) fever.f This is not very widely different from the viewof Bouillaud, who,like M.Broussais, regards it as the result of meningo-encephalic inflammation.^ * The Morbid Anatomy of the Brain, &c.

ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE. 253 tomical character of the strumous or scrofulous gland. In many instances of scrofulous enlarge- ment and induration, the glands are indeed found to be occupied with minute bodies, somewhat firm, which undergo a slow liquefaction or mollescence. But it is perhaps too limited a view to restrict to this only the characters of scrofula. In some instances these tubercles appear to consist of the original cells of the gland, filled with albuminous or albumino-calcareous matter. 6. Melanotic Deposition is common in the tra- cheo-bronchial lymphatic glands, and in those of the groin. Of the former, an example is at the present moment before me in the lungs of a woman much occupied by tubei'cular masses. CHAPTER XI. The three orders of tubes or canals, the anato- mical characters, and pathological relations of which have now been completed, constitute what has been termed the Vascular System, (Va- sa ; Systema Vasoriim. Das Gefass System. JLe Systeme Vasculaire.) The great extent of its dis- tribution, and the part which it performs in all the processes of the living body, both in health, and during disease, must be easily understood. In every texture and organ arteries and veins are found; and in aU, except a few, the art of the ana- tomist has demonstrated those colourless valvular tubes denominated lymphatics. The arrangement

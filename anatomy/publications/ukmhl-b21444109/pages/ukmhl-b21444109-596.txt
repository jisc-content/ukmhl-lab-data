These, however, have no distinct medullary cavity, and resemble in all respects the epiphyses and the short irregu- lar bones in general. In these the disease occurs in children and young persons. It occurs also in the lower jaw, and occasionally in the vertebrae. y. Enostosis. Medullary Exostosis.â€”To this head I do not refer the examples quoted by Hous- tet from Ruysch, Cheselden, and Daubenton, and which I conceive belong to necrosis. There are nevertheless instances of cylindrical bones having an accretion of bony or osteo-coUoid matter depo- sited in their interior, to such an extent as at once to enlarge much the dimensions of the bone, and obliterate the medullary cavity. Examples of this are recorded by Cheselden,* Mery,f Tri- pier, Houstet, X and J. Bell; and Sir A. Cooper describes the disease at length under the name exostosis of the medullary membrane. According to the observation of this experienced surgeon, the disease occurs in two forms, the fungous and the cartilaginous. Both originate from the medul- lary web ; both produce enlargement, expansion, softening, and separation of the osseous walls ; and both ultimately terminate in ulcerative ab- sorption of the affected bone. In certain circum- stances, however, they differ from each other. The * Osteographia, p. 5S. t Mem. (le rAcademie des Sciences, 1706, p. 245. % Mem. de I'Acad. Roy. Chinirgie, Tome iii. p. 130.

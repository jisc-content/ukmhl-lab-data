649 MUCOUS MEMBRANE. These two orders of membranous tissue have each two surfaces, an attached or adherent, and a free one. The adherent surface is attached, 1*/, to muscles, as in the tongue, most of the mouth and fauces, oesophagus, and whole alimentary canal, and the bladder ; ^d, to fibrous membranes, as in the nasal cavities and part of the larynx, in which it is attached to periosteum or perichon- drium, the palate, ureter, and pelvis of the kid- ney ; 3c?, to fibro-cartilages, as in the windpipe, (trachea,) and bronchial tubes. The free surface is not uniform or similar throughout. The appearance of the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane is different from that of the stomach or intestines ; the surface of the tongue and mouth is different from that of the trachea; and the free surface of the urethra is unlike that of the bladder. These variations de- pend on difference of structure, and are connected with a difference in properties ; yet anatomists have improperly applied to the whole what was pecviliar to certain parts only, and have thus creat- ed a system in which some truth is blended with much misrepresentation. Mucous membrane consists, like skin, of a corion or derma, and an epidermis or cuticle. The mucous corion is a firm dense gray sub- stance, which forms the ground-work of the mem- brane in most regions of the body, but which is evi- dently represented by the fibrous system, e. g. the periosteum or perichondrium, in some other situa-

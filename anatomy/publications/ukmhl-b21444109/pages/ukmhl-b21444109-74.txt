GENERAL ANATOMY. 54 ^ CHAPTER III. ADIPOSE TISSUE, (Tela adiposa,—Tissu adi- peux,—Tissu graisseux.) Section I. The separate existence of an adipose membrane was suspected by Malpighi, distinctly taught by De Bergen and Morgagni, and demonstrated by William Hunter. It was, however, confounded with the filamentous tissue, under the general name of cellular membrane, adipose membrane, and cellular fat, by Winslow, by Portal, by Bi- chat, and most of the continental anatomists, till distinguished and positively described by M. Be- clard himself. According to the dissections of De Bergen and Morgagni, the demonstrations of Hunter, and the observations of M. Beclard, its structure consists of rounded packets or parcels (pelotons) separated from each other by furrows of various depth, of a figure irregularly oval, or rather spheroidal, varying in diameter from a line to half an inch, according to the degree of corpulence and the part submitted to examination. Each peloton or packet is composed of small spheroidal particles, which may be easily separated by dissection, and

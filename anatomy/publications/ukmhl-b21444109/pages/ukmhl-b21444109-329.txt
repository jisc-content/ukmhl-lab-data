BRAIN. 307 and in no two brains is it possible to trace any similarity in the figure, presence, or direction of these objects. This must be understood of the whole upper, lateral, and posterior part of the convoluted surface, and, in short, all its divisions, unless where it approaches the central or figurate surface. In the latter situation, this want of uni- formity disappears; and a number of important objects are presented to the attention of the ob- server. The points at which this approach of the two surfaces takes place, are, l^'^. Along the rectilinear margin of the comniutual region, where it is contiguous with the upper surface and the posterior end of the middle or central band; ^d, From the last of these situations, on each side over the protuberance and cerebral limbs; Qd^ From this again by the outer margin of the cere- bral limbs, to the curvilinear hollow, and along its course. In the last of these situations chiefly the convoluted surface becomes important, and exhibits objects which distinguish these regions from the others. The outer surface of the cerebellum, or small brain, differs from that of the brain proper. It cannot be said to be convoluted ; for it does not present the tortuous eminences and furrows which constitute the convolutions of this part of the or- gan. But the cerebral matter of which it con- sists is disposed in the manner of plates (lamincB) or leaves (folia) parallel to each other, or at least concentric, and separated by parallel or concentric

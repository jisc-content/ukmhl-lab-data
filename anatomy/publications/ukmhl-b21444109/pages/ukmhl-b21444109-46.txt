But when an incision is made into this tissue in the living body, it is found, that, if we except those fluids which issue from divided vessels, nothing is observed to escape, but a thin exhalation or va- pour, which is evidently of an aqueous nature. This is what some authors have termed, from its resemblance to the serous part of the blood, the cellular serosity, (Bichat,) and the quantity of which has been greatly exaggerated. In the liv- ing body it appears not to exist as a distinct fluid, but merely as a thin vapour, which communicates to the tissue the moist appearance which it pos- sesses. This fluid is understood to be derived from the minute colourless capillaries named exhalants; and it is supposed to be no sooner poured forth in an insensible manner, than it is removed by the ab- sorbing power either of lymphatics, according to the followers of the Hunterian hypothesis, or of minute veins, according to Magendie. It is of no great moment whether this process of absorption be ascribed to lymphatics or to veins, or be under- * Caroli August! a Bergen, Programma de Membrana Cellulosa.

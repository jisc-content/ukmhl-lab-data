518 GENERAL ANATOMY. and the loss of power which follows long and ob- stinate, or neglected and repeated, attacks of the disease. The question, whether there be any thing pe- culiar in the nature of rheumatic inflammation is not undeserving attention. This, however, is not the place for discussing it; and if the views now advanced be well-founded, it may be inferred that its peculiarities consist in the anatomical and phy- sical qualities of the texture in which I have at- tempted to show it is seated. Though in acute rheumatism the inflammation affects a large projjortion, if not the whole of the fascial system, local forms of the disease may oc- cur, in which it is confined with more or less ac- curacy to one or two fasciae. Thus inflammation of the fascia of the temporal and masseter muscles produces rheumatism of the temple and rheuma- tic locked jaw; that of the occipito-frontal fascia rheumatism of the head ; that of the cervical fascia crick in the neck; that of the pectoral fascia and the intersections of the intercostal muscles spuri- ous pleurisy {pleurodyne;) that of the abdominal fascise a rheumatic belly-ach; that of the lum- bar fasciae lumbago; and that of the aponeurotic parts of the glutaeal muscles genuine sciatica or hip-gout. 2. Tyroma.â€”The tyromatous deposition in the tubercular form may take place in the periosteum. The tubercles which in colour and physical qua- lities resemble tyromatous matter in other situa-

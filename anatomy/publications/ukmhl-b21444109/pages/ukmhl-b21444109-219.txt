The existence of ;hese vessels, he conceives, is established by the ivatery exudation which appears in these several parts after a good injection of the arteries, fj As these minute canals, however, through which this injected fluid is believed to percolate, have never been seen, or rendered capable of actual in- spection, their existence was denied by Mascagni, ivho ascribed the phenomena of exhalation to the presence of inorganic porosities in the arterial pa- ■ietes, through which he imagined the fluids tran- suded to the membranes or organs in which they tvere found.

The outer wall is the most remarkable. It rests on the uncifoi-m band (Der haakenformige Markbiindel) at the entrance of the Sylvian fossa, which connects the convolutions of the anterior lobes by the perforated spot with the middle lobe. From this unciform band as a centre the fibres of the whole outer wall radiate ; and as the deep ones are beneath the level of the cerebral limb, Reil regards them as connected neither with this, nor with the beam or mesolobe. He represents, nevertheless, the radiation of the outer wall as too much detached from the unciform band. Fre- quent examination of this part leads me to repre- sent the outer wall and the unciform band as parts of the same system of fibres. The unciform band is situate not on the same vertical plane with the rest of the outer wall, which not only radiates in every direction forward, upward, and backward, but swells out laterally, or towards the convolut- ed region of the hemispheres. The result of this arrangement is, that the section which shows the unciform band most distinctly shows only the peripheral or marginal fibres of the outer wall. A section more external or lateral, however, shows the radiating fibres of the part between the centre, (the luiciform process,) and the circum- ference ; and in order to see them distinctly all

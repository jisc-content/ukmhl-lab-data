741 SEROUS MEMBRANE. surfaces, an attached or adherent, and a free or im- adherent. The attached surface, which is also termed its outer one, is that by which it is connected to the tissue or organ which it covers ; it is somewhat irregular, flocciilent or tomentose, and is evidently connected by fine filamentous tissue. The degree of attachment is very variable in different mem- branes, and in different points of the same mem- brane. In general serous membranes adhere much less firmly to the walls of cavities than to the surface of the contained organs. Thus the abdominal peritona2um and the costal pleura are more easily removed than the intestinal perito- naeum and the pulmonic pleura. The peritonajum adheres feebly to the bladder, to the liver, and to the pancreas, more intimately to the different regions of the intestinal tube, and seems to be almost identified with the substances of the female organs of generation. From the interior of the cap- sular pericardium and from the vaginal coat it is al- most impossible to detach the serous pellicle. The former, however, I shall have occasion to show, is peculiar in having between the serous surface and the fibrous membrane no filamentous tissue, upon the abundance or deficiency of which the degree of adhesion depends. The free or unadherent surface, which has been also named hiner, is very smooth or polished and uniform, moistened with a watery fluid, from which it derives in some degree its shining ap-

GENERAL ANATOMY. 8 avail himself of the results of previous and coeval inquiry, he scrupulously avoided adopting what he had not verified by personal observation. The work which he modestly styled Elements of Phy- siology shows, that, in extent of information and soundness of judgment, he had no rival in the day in which he lived ; and though something has been added to science since his death, it is more by the combined efforts of many than by the la- bours of any individual. Amidst so much excellence it was unfortunate that the vain search after an elementary fibre or rudiment, into which every variety of animal sub- stance was supposed to be resolved, led him to indulge in some fanciful conjecture and gratuitous generalization. * * It will scarcely be credited that Haller could speak of this hypothetical fibre in the following terms. " Fibra quo communi nomine multiplex genus elementorum comprehen- dimus, et cujus discrimina continue exponemus, communis toti humano corpori materies est, etiam, ut alibi ostendemus, cerebro et meduUse spinali. Fragilis aut mollis, elastica, aut penitus pultacea, longa absque fere latitudine, vel lata ut longitudini par fere latitudo sit, ossa, cartilagines, mem- branas, vasa, ligamenta, tendines, musculos, nervos, cellulo- sumtextum, viscerumparenchymata, pilos et ungues sola con- stituit." Here it is represented as constituting the most oppo- site animal substances, and entering into the composition of every texture. The composition of this ideal fibre is not less wonderful. " Invisibilis ea fibra, quam sola mentis acie attingimus, ex solis dementis terreis et glutine, non ex minoribus fibris composita, cum sui similibus abit in duo conspicua elementa solida corporis animalis."

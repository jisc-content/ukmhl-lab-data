GENERAL ANATOMY. 382 changed. * The same change was observed by Dr Black of Newry in the cerebral hemisphere. (Transactions, Vol. II.) When pulpy disorganization is connected with efTusion of blood, it has been supposed by M. Ros- tan to be the cause of that effusion. That this supposition is inadmissible, I infer from the fol- lowing facts, which I have witnessed more than once. 1st, That the portion of brain inclosing the clot is soft and pulpy all round, but sound in pro- portion to the distance from the clot. 2d, That in some instances in which partial recovery takes place, part of the red clot has disappeared, and its place is supplied by serous fluid. 3d, That in cases in which death takes place early, the pulpy disorganization is less complete than those in which it takes place at a later period. In short, the extent of the disorganization is proportionate to the interval which elapses between the effusion of the blood and the period of death. When pulpy disorganization accompanies tu- mours of the brain, that it is the effect of the pre- sence of these tumours, and the chronic congestion which they cause, is sufficiently obvious to render superfluous any minute induction. It is enough to say, that, though not constant, it is a very ge- neral effect. (Morgagni, Meckel, Sandifort, Powell, Yellowly, Blane, &c.)

546 GENERAL ANATOMY. and homogeneous, yet presenting a fibrous ar- rangement. Extending across the summit of the tooth in the manner of an incrustation, it is thick above, and diminishes gradually to the root, where it disappears. This fact is demonstrated by ma- cerating a tooth in dilute nitric acid, when the bony root becomes yellow, while the crown re- mains white. The enamel is not injectible, and is therefore believed to be inorganic. It is also filed and broken without being reproduced ; nor does it present any of the usual properties which distin- guished organized bodies. The piercing sensa- tion which is communicated through the tooth from the impression of acids seems to depend on the mere chemical operation, and not on the phy- siological effect. Upon the whole, the enamel is to be viewed as the result of a process of secretion or deposition, but as inorganic entirely. The bony part of the tooth is the root and that internal part which is covered on the sides and above by the enamel. It consists of close-grained bony matter, as dense as the compact walls of the long bones, or the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone. The fibres which are said to be seen in it are exactly of the same nature as those in bone. In the interior of the bony part of each tooth is a cavity which descends into the root, and com- municates at its extremity with the outer surface by openings corresponding with the number of

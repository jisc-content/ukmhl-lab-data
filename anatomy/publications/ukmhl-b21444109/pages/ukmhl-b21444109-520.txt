498 GENERAL ANATOMY. depend on parts of the muscle assuming the carti- laginous induration. The substance of the organ then cuts firm, and resists the knife. The change seems either to depend on, or to be connected with, a process of chronic injection ; for the vessels are large, distended, and abundant. In the deltoid and biceps of the fencer, and the glutaei and gastroc- nemii of the dancer, though large and well deve- loped, no change of this description can be recog- nized. They are indeed firm and tough, like the muscle of entire male animals, but present nothing of the morbid enlargement, congestion, and indu- ration found in the hypertrophied heart and blad- der. In proof of the justice of these views it may be added, that the instances in which the muscu- lar coat of the stomach is admitted to be hyper- trophied, are those in which scirrhus, or some si- milar chronic inflammatory state, affects the colla- teral tissues.

Atrophy of muscles, or diminution of size, is more frequent, and may arise either from general disease, as in consumption, dropsy, &c. or from lo- cal debility, as in rheumatism, palsy, &c.; or, in short, from defective local nutrition, or, as after un- reduced luxations, from want of exercise of par- ticular muscles. The best example of complete atrophy is that which takes place in muscles poi- soned by lead, which become small, shrunk, pale, and void of irritability. 4.

Indepen- dent of its being seen in the muscles of the sheep by Vaughan,* it has been observed in those of the human subject by Haller, Louis, Maugre, Vicq- D'Azyr, Dumas, Emmanuel, Laennec, and Adams. Louis, so early as 1739? in amputating the right leg, found the gemelli, plantaris, j)oplitaeus, so- laeus, the long common flexor of the toes, the pro- per flexor of the great toe, and the tihialis posticus converted into fat.f Maugre found the muscles of the same region, excepting the gemeUi, which were greatly diminished in size, converted into an adipose mass easily divisible by the knife.:|: Vicq- D'Azyr, in an old subject, saw the psoas and iliacus, the glutaeus medius and minimus, the ad- ductors, the deep posterior muscles of the leg, and the plantar muscles, completely changed into fibro- cellular fat, without traces of remaining fibre. In the sciatic portion of the semitendinosus and bi- ceps, the gemelli, the extensors of the toes, that of the great toe, and the tibialis anticus only, was it possible to recognize fibres with distinct direc- tion. The sartorius presented the gradual tran- sition from muscle to fat, being muscular above * Some account of an Uncommon Appearance, &c. By W. Vaughan, M. D.

VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. 133 if not opposed by suitable treatment, may produce cutaneous inflammation terminating in a bad ulcer. (Ulcus varicosum.) The same process nearly may result from the inflammation round a single vari- cose trunk. Varix sometimes terminates in la- ceration or rupture ; and if the vein be large and not covered by the skin, the hemorrhage may be fatal. (Laurentius, Nebel, Bonet.) Varix of the vena azi/gos terminating in rupture and fatal he- morrhage was seen by Manfredi. * Ossificatio7i. Calcareous or osseous matter is very rarely deposited in venous tissue. Instances of this, however, are recorded. (Morgagni, Baillie, Hodgson.) f Loose stony .concretions have been found in the cavity of veins, which in such circumstances are generally dilated. These concretions do not appear to be formed and deposited in the venous tissue, but, according to Hodgson, are more likely to have been produced outside by some contiguous tissue, and to have found their way into the venous tube by progressive absorption. Is it not possible that they are the result of temporary retardation or stagnation of a portion of blood around which, as a nucleus, calcareous matter had been deposited. They have not been chemically examined ; but it is said that they have no appearance of any thing osseous. These concretions, which in other re- spects are very imperfectly known, have been termed vein-stones. (Phlebolites.) â€¢ Morgagni, xxvi. 29- t Treatise, Part iv. sect. 2.

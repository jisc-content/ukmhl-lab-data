ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 79 phrenics. The abdominal portion is supplied from the spermatics, the lumbar, and in some instances the mesocolic artery. The same arrangement nearly is observed with regard to the veins. Few textures are more liberally supplied with nerves than arteries are. Almost every considera- ble trunk or vessel is surrounded with numerous plexiform filaments of nerves, many of which may be traced into the tissue of the artery. The an- terior part of the arch of the aorta is abundantly supplied with branches from the superficial car- diac nerves, which Haller was unable to trace be- yond the artery. The coeliac, the mesenteric, and the mesocolic arteries are invested with nume- rous plexiform nervous filaments derived from the large semilunar ganglion of the splanchnic nerve. The renal arteries in like manner are surrounded with numerous twigs of the renal plexus. And each of the intercostal arteries at its origin re- ceives nervous threads from the intercostal nerves. This arrangement, which is observed chiefly in the blood-vessels going to the internal organs, led Bichat to announce it as a general fact, that the arteries derived their nerves almost exclusively from the ganglions, and the gangliar nerves. * The inference does not rest upon strict observation, and evidently owes its birth to the hypothetical opi- nions of this ingenious physiologist. AU the ar- * " Le grand arbre a sang rouge ou I'arteriel, est presque exclusivement embrasse par la premiere classe ties nerves." .â€”Anatomie Generale, Tom. I. p. 302.

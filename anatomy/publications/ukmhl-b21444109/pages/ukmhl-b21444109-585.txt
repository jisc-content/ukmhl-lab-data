BONE. 561 This, which is the carious ulcer (ulcus cariosum,) of practical authors, may be seen in the legs of those who have been affected by the constitutional symptoms of syphilis, and who have undergone for it repeated courses of mercury. * In the cases in which I have seen it, it gave rise to extreme local pain and great constitutional disorder, re- quiring amputation; and one case terminated fa- tally. Occurring in the bones of the cranium, which it occasionally does, it is one of the forms of the disease described by the older authors un- der the fantastic appellation of the garland of Ve- nus ; (Corofia Veneris.) ^. That the periosteum may be concerned in extensive but morbid secretion of osseous matter, giving rise to that form of tumour which has been termed by some exostosis, and by others osteosar- coma, has been already noticed. (P. 522.) The periosteum becoming thickened and morbidly [vascular and painful, assumes additional energy in the deposition of bony matter over a certain space. But the bone so deposited is never ar- ranged in the manner of healthy bone. Some- times it is in the form of a large shapeless promi- nence deposited on the outer surface of the origi- nal bone. This, which was remarked by Pouteau,f * Of this kind appear to be the tibia and fibula delineated by Roberg. See his Dissert, in Haller Disp. Chirurg. Tom. iv. p. 561. t CEuvres Posthumes, Tom. iii.

This, however, is no more a reason for regarding this pellucid pellicle as the same as the dura mater, than the intimate adhesion of the capsular peri- cardium to its fibrous coat, or of the peritonaeum to the female ovaries, is for regarding the mem- branes as part of these organs. Immersion in boiling water and maceration produce on this sur- face of the du7'a mater the same effects as on the free surface of the 'pia mater. Lastly, the pheno- mena of morbid processes indicate that these sur- faces are in all respects similar ; and if the thin pel- licle on the free surface of the j>?V/ mater is entitled to separate existence, that on the free surface of the dura mater is equally so. The continuity of these two divisions, demon- strated by their configuration, affords proofs of the same description. This is most easily accom- plished by tracing the dura mater from those points at which it adheres to the inner surface of the cranium, to those at which the several nerves issue from that cavity by the cranial holes. If the optic nerves be attentively examined at the spot where they enter the optic foramina, the dura mater, which covers the bone around these holes, is found to go a very short distance into them, to stop suddenly, and be reflected back- wards, in anatomical language, to cover the ner-

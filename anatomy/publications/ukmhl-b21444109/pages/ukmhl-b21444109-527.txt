TENDON. 505 A species of flattened tendons, to which the name of aponeurosis has been given, may justly be united with this tissue. The best examples are in the aponeurotic or tendinous expansion of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, the aponeurotic part of the occipito-frontal muscle of the head, and the upper or broad end of the tendo AchilUs. The anatomical structure and the che- mical properties of each of these varieties of ani- mal substance are quite similar, and somewhat dif- ferent from that which has been termed fascia. Section II. In tendon inflammation is rarely spontaneous, and is generally the result of cut, tear, bruise, twist, wrench, or burn, when the effects vary according to the natvire of the injury. Simple division of tendon may unite without much diffi- culty, though the medium of reunion appears to be filamentous tissue with some gelatino-albu- minous matter. In laceration complete reunion will depend upon the extent of the injury. That of the tendo-AcJiillis is the most frequent. I have seen complete rupture of the extensor ten- don of the middle finger unite in the course of four months without perceptible trace of the acci- dent, and with complete restoration of the functions of the finger in about four or five months more. Twists or wrenches of the joints often injure not only tendons, but ligaments, fasciae, and even carti- lage, and occasion inflammation of all these tex- tures at once. Of this the injury termed sprain

GENEKAL ANATOMY. 650 tions. It is most distinctly seen in the mouth and throat, and in various parts of the alimentary ca- nal. In the first situation it is more vascular, less gray and dense than in the intestinal mucous mem- brane. It possesses two surfaces, an inner, adherent to the submucous filamentous tissue, and an outer or proper mucous surface. In the stomach, the mucous corion is in the form of a soft but firm membranous substance, about ^th or |th of a line thick, tough, of a dun-gray or fawn colour, (inter- mediate between Sienna-yellow and ochre-yellow; Syme,) slightly translucent, and sinking in water. The attached or inner surface is flocculent and to- mentose and a shade lighter than the outer, which presents a sort of shag or velvet, consisting of very minute piles. This, when examined by a good lens at oblique light, appears to consist of an infinite number of very minute roundish bodies closely set, but separated by equally minute linear pits, and occasionally circular depressions. In the ileum it presents much the same characters ; but the minute bodies of its shaggy surface are still larger and more distinct, and may be seen by the naked eye. In the windpipe, again, it is ra- ther thinner and lighter coloured; and while its outer surface presents numerous minute pores, it is much smoother than in the alimentary canal, and entirely destitute of those minute bodies seen in the latter. It nowhere presents any appear- ance of fibres. The mucous corion rests on a layer of filamen-

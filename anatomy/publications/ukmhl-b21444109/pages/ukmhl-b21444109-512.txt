490 GENERAL ANATOMY. almost colourless. The colour of the muscles of voluntary motion in man is red or fawn; but re- peated washing" or maceration in alcohol or alka- line fluids renders them much paler. The examination of the physical properties of muscle have occupied the industry of Muschen- broek, Croone, Browne Langrish, Wintringham, and others of the iatro-mathematical school. I cannot perceive that minute knowledge of these properties is of much moment to the elucidation either of its sound or its morbid states. Amidst the variable results necessarily obtained in such an inquiiy, the only point which is certain is, that muscular fibre has much less tenacity and mutual aggregation than most other tissues. It sustains much less weight and force of tension without giving way. Chemical analysis has not yet furnished any sa- tisfactory results on the nature of muscular tissue; but the general conclusion of the numerous expe- riments already instituted show that muscle con- tains fibrin, albumen, gelatine, extractive matter (osmazome), and saline substances. It is difficult to say how far the gelatine is to be regarded as proper to muscle, or derived from the filamentous tissue in which it certainly exists. The saline matters are common to muscle with most other organic substances. There is reason to believe that fibrin in considerable quantity, and albumen and osmazome in smaller proportion, are the pro- per proximate principles of muscle. Though the

260 GENERAL ANATOMY. other interior, contained, and functional, forming the indispensable part of the nervous structure. The first of these, which has been known since the time at least of Reil by the name neurilema, (vsv^ov, hXsM, iikfj^jjo,, nervi involucrum,) or nerve- coat, (Nervenhaut, Reil; Nervenhiille, Meckel;) has the form and nature of a dense membrane, not quite transparent, which is found on the out- side of the nervous chord or filament, and invests the proper nervous substance. It must not, how- ever, be imagined that the neurilema forms a cy- lindrical tube, in the interior of which the ner- vous matter is contained. This latter disposi- tion, if it actually exists, applies to the smaller nerves only, and to some of those which go to the organs of sensation,â€”a peculiarity which we shall notice subsequently. Any large nervous trunk, for example, the spi- ral or median of the arm, or the sciatic nerve of the thigh, is found to be composed of several small nervous chords placed in juxtaposition, and each of which, consisting of appropriate neurilema and nervous substance, is connected to the other by delicate filamentous tissue. These, however, do not, through their entire course, maintain the parallel disposition in respect to each other, but are observed to cross and penetrate each other, so as to form an intimate interlacement of nervous chords and filaments, each of which, however mi- nute, is accompanied with its investing neurilema. The neurilema, in short, may be represented as a

These longitudinal fi- bres, he asserts, are more distinct in the saphena than in the crural vein, which accompanies the artery. Lastly, he remarks, these fibres are pro- portionally more conspicuous in branches than in trunks. * Notwithstanding the apparent correctness of this description, Magendie informs us, he has sought in vain for the fibres of the proper venous membrane ; and he remarks, that, though he has observed very numerous filaments interlacing in all directions, yet these assume the longitudinal and parallel appearance only when the tube is fold- ed longitudinally,â€”a disposition often seen in the larger veins. By Meckel, on the contrary, the accuracy of the observation of Bichat is maintained. This anato- mist states that he has, by the most minute dissec- tions, assured himself that these fibres are longi- tudinal ; but he admits that they are not uniform- ly present in all parts of the venous system, and that in degree and abundance they are liable to great variation. He follows Bichat also in repre- senting these fibi'es as thicker and more distinct in the system of the inferior than in that of the superior cava, and in the superficial than in the deep veins. In the inferior cava of the human subject, cer- * Anatomie Generale, Tom. I. p. 399-

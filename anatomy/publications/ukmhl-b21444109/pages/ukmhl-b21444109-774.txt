750 GENEllAI. ANATOMY. ordinary works the web-like membrane, (tunica arachnoidea.J It is believed to be a separate mem- brane from the pia mater ; but that which forms the inner or cerebral surface of the dura mater, has a claim equally strong to this distinction. The inner or cerebral surface of the proper or soft membrane, I have already said, is filamen- tous, flocculent, and somewhat rough. It indeed presents a surface which sends out many angular processes of animal substance, which is filamen- tous and loose in appearance, and which evident- ly, by numerous minute vessels, arteries, and veins, communicates with the convoluted surface of the brain. These processes, which are the To- menta of the ancient anatomists, correspond to the furrows of the convoluted surface in which they are lodged. In detaching the membrane from this part of the brain, numerous vessels are observed to be drawn out of its substance; and when the membrane is injected these vessels may be seen distinctly filled, and communicating with the gray matter of the convoluted surface. The veins of this membrane may be traced to the sinuses in those large longitudinal vessels which are lodged in folds of the hard membrane. After suitable injection, it is difficult to per- ceive any thing but arteries and veins in the pro- per cerebral membrane. Neither nerves nor ab- sorbents have yet been recognized in it. Bichat considers that it contains a notable quantity of cellular tissue. This, however, is denied by

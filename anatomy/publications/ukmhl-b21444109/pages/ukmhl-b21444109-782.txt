GENERAL ANATOMY. 758 ment and distribution a great resemblance to the serous membranes. It differs, nevertheless, in its extreme tenuity, in the closeness with which it adheres to the collateral tissues, and, as will after- wards appear, in its slight disposition to albumi- nous exudation. It appears to contain in its struc- ture less filamentous tissue than the pure serous membranes. I have elsewhere, in treating of the develope- ment of the brain, had occasion to speak of the cerebral membranes. The pia mater in the two- fold form now described exists at an early period of the ovum, before the formation of the brain is commenced. It is then recognized in the form of a very vascular membrane, somewhat confused, but stiU sufficiently distinct to show, that in the cen- tre of each half, the cerebral matter afterwards to constitute the hemispheres is deposited from the vessels of its central or attached surface. At this period the arachnoid pellicle cannot be distinguish- ed. It is only when a considerable part of each he- misphere is formed that the free surface of the pia mater can be shown to be covered by arachnoid membrane. This may be stated in general terms to be between the end of the fifth and the middle of the seventh month. The free surface of the dura mater begins to be perceptible about the same time. The tunica albuginea of the testicle may be here mentioned as a membrane composed of fibrous tissue, embracing the gland, and a very thin pel- 4

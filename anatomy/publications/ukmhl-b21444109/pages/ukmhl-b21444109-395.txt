373 BRAIN. mentioned as the third or central portion, do not grow at the same rate. At the beginning, that is about the seventh week, the brain is found to be divided in two por- tions by a longitudinal fissure. Each half mutu- ally approaches as growth continues, and are at length united, so that at the third month the only parts found separate are the middle ventricle, the aqueduct or canal, which is at this time a large cavity continuous with it, and the fourth ven- tricle. The developement of the cavities called lateral ventricles is closely connected with that of the contiguous parts of the organ. These appear nearly in the following order. The lateral lobes appear first about three months after conception; and about the same time the mesolobe, (corpus callosum,) is formed by union of the hemispheres ; and the cylindroid processes, (cornua ammonis) vault, (fornix) mam- millary eminences, posterior commissure, and ce- rebral limbs or peduncles, may be recognized. Shortly after may be seen the ergot, or smaU hip- pocampus, and the anfractuosity from which it is- sues, and the conarium and its peduncles; then the anterior commissure, the thin partition (sep- tum lucidum) and its cavity, which at this time communicates with the middle ventricle; lastly, the semicircular fillet, (tcenia semicircularis,) and the infundibulum, which correspond to the seventh month; and about the same time the outer sur- face of the brain begins to present the eminences

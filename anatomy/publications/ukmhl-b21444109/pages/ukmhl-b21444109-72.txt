GENERAL ANATOMY. 52 facts would lead to the notion originally enter- tained by Camper, * that it is a morbid growth seated in one of the subcutaneous nerves, or pro- bably in its neurilema. f 11. Cysts. Bichat has taken considerable pains to show the influence of this tissue on the forma- tion of cysts. These, it is well known, are shut sacs containing fluids of different sorts. But how- ever these fluids may differ, the containing cyst, which is a secreting membrane, has been regard- ed as formed of condensed and modified filamen- tous tissue. Against this doctrine Bichat urges the following objections. 1. Cysts are analogous in all respects to serous membranes, and should therefore have the same origin. 2. This mecha- nical hypothesis of their origin, in which all the vessels ought to be obliterated, does not accord with the exhaling and absorbing function of cysts, nor with their mode of inflammation. 3. If these sacs are formed by the mutual application and agglutination or adhesion of cells, (that is, of the filaments,) the contiguous tissue ought to be di- minished, or to disappear when they are bulky, which is not observed to take place. 4. If cysts are formed by condensation of the filamentous tis- sue, and if their fliu'd is effused by exhalation, this fluid ought to exist in the organ which separates them from the blood. * Demonstrationum Anatomico-Pathologicariim, Lib. i.

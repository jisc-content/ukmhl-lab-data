SYSTEM OF CAPIIJ-AllY VESSELS, &;c, 145 the violent and sometimes rapid changes of struc- ture which attend inflammation. This has led to the conclusion that the blood moves in the capil- laries of such parts more rapidly, and with great- er force, (momentum,) than in the healthy state. (Parry.) With superficial observers this opinion has passed current, as generally consonant with the phenomena and effects of the inflammatory process ; and the pathologist has studied to render his notions palpable, by supposing, in the language of the mathematical physicians, an inordinate flow, morbid afflux or increased determination of blood to the inflamed parts. Had this opinion ever been subjected to rigid scrutiny its fallacy must have been manifest. \st. The fact of increased determination is not established. In its present state it is a mere as- sumption, ^d. Increased determination is not ne- cessary to the production of the effect. When the capillaries of any part are unusually loaded, this may take place from the blood not being removed with the same regularity, and in the same propor- tion in which it is conveyed, with the same faci- lity as by supposing an increased current. 3c?, Even admitting the current to be increased through any set of capillaries, it is impossible to discover the agents of such a process. It is clear it cannot be the heart. And to suppose the capillaries ca- pable of this, is to ascribe to them a power which they have not been proved to possess. Against the hypothesis of increased force and E

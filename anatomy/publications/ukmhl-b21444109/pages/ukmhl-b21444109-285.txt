Its connection with the pia mater was disproved by Reil; and though its analogy with the denticulated ligament were established, it would prove nothing regarding the neurilema. Upon the whole, the idea communicated by Reil is the most probable. According to the observa- tions of this anatomist, who examined the neuri- lema after fine and successful injection, it is libe- rally supplied with blood-vessels. These derived from the neighbouring arteries penetrate the fila- mentous sheath of the nerve; and, immediately on reaching the neurilema, divaricating at right angles, generally run along the nervous threads, {Jkmes) parallel to them, forming numerous anas- tomotic communications, and divide into innu- merable minute vessels, which penetrate between them into the minute neurilematic canals. So ma- nifold is the ramification, and so perfect the distri- bution, that in these canals not a particle of ner- vous substance is found which is not supplied with a vessel, f The arrangement of the veins is ana- logous. It appears, therefore, that the neurilema is a * Discours sur I'Histologie, par le Docteur Mayer. Bonn, I8I9.

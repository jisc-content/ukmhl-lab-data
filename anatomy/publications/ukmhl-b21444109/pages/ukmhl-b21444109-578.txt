GENERAL ANATOMY. 556 scurvy, and in those affected with the constitu- tional symptoms of syphilis, fracture is not united by bony union. 2. Diastasis.â€”Next to fracture may be placed detachment or disunion of the epiphyses, (di- ductio epiphysium.) In young subjects, while the epiphyses are still imperfectly united to the diaphysis, this may occur, in consequence of for- cible stretching, or injury of the bone. In this manner it is noticed by Palfyn, Reichel, * Wil- mer, f and others. Reichel saw it in the hu- merus, and Wilmer in the tibia. I have seen it in the humerus and in the femur, in which chief- ly it occurs. Sometimes it may be traced to in- judicious efforts by bone-setters in pulling a thigh- bone supposed to be dislocated. It is liable to be confounded with fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. If not disturbed, the injury is re- paired by union either in the ordinary manner, or with more or less extensive ossification of the neighbouring parts, causing generally stiff-joint. Consecutive disunion of an epiphysis may happen in molUties ossium and in spina ventosa. (Trioen, Reichel.) The variety of disunion now mentioned is ge- nerally confined to the epiphysis of one bone. A more general disunion, however, occurring in most of the epiphyses of the skeleton, may take place in scurvy. This was remarked especially in the scor- * M. Georgii Ch.

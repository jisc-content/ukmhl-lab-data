GENERAL ANATOMY. 100 Aneurism. On the nature of the aneurismal tumour some difference of opinion has prevailed. Since it has been the custom to settle points of pathology by reference to dissection, three opi- nions have been successively entertained. First, It was maintained by Eisner, Severinus, Hildanus, Sennert, and others, that aneurism was produced by rupture of the proper coats of the artery. The second opinion, which is that of Fernel, Forestus, Diemerbroek, &c. is that it consists in uniform dilatation of the arterial tunics. Thirdly, From the cases recorded by Lancisi, Friend, Guattani, Morgagni, and especially those described by Do- nald Monro,* it results that aneurism may arise either from rupture or from dilatation of the arte- rial tissues, or from both causes jointly. The first doctrine has been revived and stre- nuously and ingeniously defended by Scarpa, who infers that aneurism never consists in dilatation, but invariably arises from erosion and laceration of the proper coats, and injection of arterial blood into the filamentous or membranous sheath with which the vessel is invested. By Hodgson, again, this doctrine has been successfully combated, and the third opinion shown to be most consonant with the process of aneurismal disease. The re- sult of his inquiries may be stated in the follow- ing manner. 1*/, In many aneurisms the first step is destruction and partial laceration of the internal and proper coats of the artery; and when the blood escapes from its cavity it dis- * Essays and Observations Phys. and Lit.

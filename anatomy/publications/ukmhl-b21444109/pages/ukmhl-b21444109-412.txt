At least no external cause can be recognized ; and if it were, it would be such as in other subjects would perhaps be inadequate to the effect. There is, however, a class of purulent collections in the brain, which in general it is pos- sible to trace to mechanical violence inflicted on the head ; and it is remarkable how long a period may elapse between the date of the injury, and that destruction of the organ which renders the continuance of life impossible. Pigray gives a case in which an abscess, the size of a nut, proved fatal at the end of six months ;* and Morand mentions one in which a soldier, who had received a shot in Italy, after slight treatment of the wound, proceeded thence to Paris; and nine months elapsed before sup- puration and total destruction of the right lobe terminated life, f In a case mentioned by Prochaska, the first foun- dation of the disease appears to have been fre- quent beating on the head for years, finally car- ried to intensity by a blow on the forehead, five months after which death took place, I In a case by Sir E. Home, nearly nineteen months elapsed * Libre iv. chap. ix. f Opuscules cle Chirurgie, 1. c. p. 159. % Obs. Patholog. Section iv. apud Opera Minora, p. 304.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 356 those of the cerebral limbs. {Crura, Die Hirn- schenkel.) These are cylindrical masses, stretch- ing obliquely between the protuberance behind and the optic chambers or eminences before. The longitudinal bands of which they consist give their lower surface a fluted appearance, at least to the inner margin of the optic tracts, by which they are obliquely crossed. Connected before with the posterior-inferior region of the tJialami, they may be traced into the substance of these parts, where they undergo an arrangement new and peculiar. Though the name couch or thalamus be still applied to these bodies, it conveys an erroneous idea of their anatomical relations. With the striated bodies, they form the central portion and most perfectly organized nucleus of the organ. Each optic thalamus may be said to be united behind with its fellow by means of the quadrige- minous eminences. These consist superficially of epithelion or capsular cerebral matter, below of a semilunar stratum of fibres derived from the ce- rebral limbs, while a similar production forms the deep layer of the corpus geniculatum internum. In each optic thalamus may be distinguished, according to Reil, four layers, each consisting of gray and white matter. The uppermost is mere- ly the epithelion or condensed matter which forms the covering. The second is connected with the inner corpus geniculatum, from which fibres ap- pear to spread or expand in the manner of rays, over the outer edge of the limb, and embracing the part to be mentioned as the nucleus of the

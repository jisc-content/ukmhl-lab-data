FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 29 extensively diffused through the body. In parti- cular regions it undergoes some modifications, which may be referred to the following heads. 1. Beneath the skin, or rather under the adipose membrane—the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue ; 2. Beneath the villous or mucous membranes—the submucous cellular tissue ; 3. Beneath the serous membranes—the subserous cellular tissue ; 4. Round blood-vessels, excreting ducts, or other organs—the enclosing tissue, vas- cular sheaths, &c.; 5. In the substance of or- gans—the penetrating cellular tissue. The situation of the subcutaneous filamentous tissue deserves particular notice. Though gene- rally represented as below the skin, it is not im- mediately under this membranous covering. The skin rests on the adipose membrane, beneath which again is placed the filamentous tissue, ex- tending like a web over the muscles and blood- vessels, penetrating between the fibres and bundles of the former, surrounding the tendons and liga- ments, and connected by these productions with a deep-seated layer, on which the muscles move, where they do not adhere to the periosteum and to bones. The extensive distribution of the subcutaneous filamentous tissue, the mutual connection of its parts, and its ready communication with the fila- mentous tissue of the raucous and serous mem- branes, were demonstrated by HaUer, William Hunter, and Bordeu, and have been clearly ex-

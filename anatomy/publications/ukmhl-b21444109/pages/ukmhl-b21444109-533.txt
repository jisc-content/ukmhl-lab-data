TENDON. 511 in the fore part of the neck and chest is found a fascia, the relations and uses of which have been well described by Mr Allan Burns.* In the cer- vical region we find a firm fascia descending from the occipital bone along the vertebrae, covering and connecting the muscles of each side till it reaches the loins, where, in the form of a thick strong membrane, it forms the lumbar fascia, (fascia lumhorum.) It may further be traced over and between the glutaei muscles ; connected afterwards with the broad femoral fascia, (fascia lata ;J and thence over the knee and leg to the foot. Much in the same manner a membranous web, thinner and more delicate, but of the same structure, may be traced from the chest along the upper extremity, till at the wrist it is identified with the annular ligament, and in the hand with the palmar fascia. In all these situations the general fascial envelope sends slips or productions (fasciee intermusculares) between the muscles, and into their substance, f Section II. The morbid relations of this system are im- portant. But in consequence of their being often combined with other tissues, it is difficult to dis- tinguish them properly. 1. Inflammation in various forms is not uncom- mon, and may take place either spontaneously, or as the effect of accident. * Surgical Anatomy, pp. 33, 36. f Surgical Anatomy, by Ab. Colles. Dublin, 1811.

GENERA I. ANATOMY. 522 actions*; a similar case seen by Leveille in 1793; and that of ossification of the tendinous centre of the same muscle mentioned in the body of Col- lalto by Cruveilhier. The instance of cartilagi- nous induration of the deep-seated muscles of the leg, found by Dupuytren in the body of a man affected with Arabian elephantiasis, though con- sidered byCz'uveilhier as ossification of the muscles, is probably with greater justice to be viewed as of the same description, f A singular instance of ossification of the fibrous septum of the corpus cavernosum so complete as to require excision occurred to Dr M'Lellan of Baltimore in the United States. X 5. Some of the forms of osteosteatoma and osteosarcoma appear to originate in the perios- teum. The former is generally an encysted tu- mour, and, according to the observation of Meckel, may primarily affect this membrane. The latter, from its anatomical characters, bears a greater af- finity with this source ; and I think, in several cases, I have been able to trace osteo-sarcomato- matous tumours to the periosteum. || Of neither, however, are the local relations, when examined, so simple or distinct as to enable the pathologist to determine the question positively.

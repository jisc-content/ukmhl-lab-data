GENERAL ANATOMY. 294 woman of twenty-nine years. * Soon after it was observed by Mr Pearson in the subcutaneous nerve which accompanies the saphsena vein, in the leg of a woman of fifty-one; in the back of the leg, near the tendo AchilUs; and at the bend of the arm, near the median vein, f in a young married woman. Since this time the disease was fully and accurately described by Mr William Wood of this city; ^ and occasional cases have been published by other authors.^ Mr Wood questions the justice of the opinion of Camper, that the tubercle is seated in the nerve- coat, or is a nervous tumour ; and thinks that it is a distinct or peculiar species of tumour, situate in the subcutaneous cellular membrane. It may not perhaps be possible to prove that every little subcutaneous tubercle is of this description. But the observations of the authors above-mentioned, and those of A. Petit, || Tissot, Lassus, Jacopi, ^ Monteggia, ** and Alexander, show manifestly that the nerves are liable to tubercles of this kind. * Memoirs of the Medical Society of London, Vol. III. p. 58.

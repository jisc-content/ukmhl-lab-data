92 GENERAL ANATOMY. the vessel rough ; in the latter they are simply firm, and are less earthy or gritty, and without forming asperities in the inside of the vessel, may make it merely firm and unyielding, and deprive it of its elasticity. In either case, these calcareous deposites, confined more or less to one side, may spread along the tube for a considerable extent. They seldom affect the whole circumference of an artery unless in the lower extremities, in which they have been observed to form distinct rings, connected by intermediate portions of sound ar- tery. (Hodgson.) When the deposition is partial and limited, and of short duration, it is still covered by the inner membrane ; and the inside of the vessel, though irregular, is comparatively smooth. When the patches multiply and enlarge so as to coalesce, the inner membrane gives way at one or more points of the margin of the calcareous deposite, which now adheres only to the surface of the pro- per membrane ; and an irregular ragged circum- ference is exposed. If the artery contains many patches, its entire inner surface presents a series of asperities resulting from the rupture of the thin pellicle of inner membrane with which they were at first covered. Yet these calcareous pat- ches are not known to be detached entirely. Scarpa represents this morbid change as taking place something differently. But I shall after- wards show that this arises from confounding the calcareous with the steatomatous deposition, a

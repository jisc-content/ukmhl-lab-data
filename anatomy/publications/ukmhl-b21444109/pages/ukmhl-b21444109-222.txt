GENEKAL ANATOMY. bold supi)ositioii of lateral porosities by Mascagni. This defect in liis system has therefore been re- cognized recently both by Magendie and Beclard, the first of whom, though he admits the existence of exhalation as a process of the living body, al- lows that no explanation of its mechanism or ma- terial cause has been given, and asserts that Bi- chat has created the system of vessels termed ex- halants ;â€”while the second thinks that anatomical observation furnishes no evidence of their existence. The colourless capillaries, he observes, which are admitted by all, and the existence of which is satisfactorily established by the well-known experi- ment of Bleuland, proves nothing whatever con- cerning the existence of exhalant vessels; for these colourless arteries are observed to terminate in colourless A'eins, and there is no proof hitlierto adduced of their proceeding further, or terminat- ing by open mouths. He admits that the fact of exhalations in the living body, of nutrition, of transudation by arterial extremities, shows that these extremities possess openings through which the fluids of exhalation, the materials of nutrition, and the matter of injection escape. But whether these openings are found at the point at which the capillary arteries are continuous with veins, or be- long to a distinct order of vessels continued beyond these arteries, is a question which observation has not yet determined, and which it perhaps is unable to determine. Such is the present state of know- ledge in relation to the existence of exhalant arte-

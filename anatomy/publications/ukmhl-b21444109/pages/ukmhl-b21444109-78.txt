GENEllAL ANATOMY. 58 has also delineated these vessels, the furrow or space between each packet contains an artery and vein, which being subdivided penetrates between the minute grains or particles of which the packet is composed, and furnishes each with a small ar- tery and vein. The effect of this arrangement is, that each individual grain or adipose particle is supported by its artery and vein as by a foot-stalk or peduncle, and that those of the same packet are kept together not only by contact, but by the community of ramifications from the same vessel. These grains are so closely attached, that Mas- cagni, who examined them with a good lens, com- pares them to a cluster offish-spawn, {tm aggrup- pimento di uova.) Grutzmacher found much the same arrangement in the grains and vesicles of the marrow of bones. * It has been supposed that the adipose tissue re- ceives nervous filaments; and Mascagni conceives he has demonstrated its lymphatics. Both points, however, are so problematical, that of neither of these tissues is the distribution known. The substance contained in these vesicles is entire- ly inorganic. Always solid in the dead body, it has been represented as fluid during life by Winslow,f * De Ossium Medulla. 1748.

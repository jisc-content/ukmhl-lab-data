GENERAL ANATOMY. 264 tissue of membranous form, with a multiplied me- chanical surface, liberally supplied with blood-ves- sels, from which the nervous matter is secreted and nourished. It is impossible, indeed, to doubt, that, of the two parts which compose the nervous chord, it is the most perfectly organized ; and that, though it may not be similar in structure to the pia ma- ter, it is quite analogous in the use to which it is subservient. Like that membrane, it sustains the vessels of the nerve ; it presents a mviltiplied sur- face, over which the vessels are distributed ; and by penetrating deep into the body of the nerve, it conveys the nutritious vessels in the most ca- piUary form to the inmost recesses of the nervous substance. * The arrangement which has been above describ- ed is the only one which can be regarded as gene- ral. It varies in particular regions ; and these va- rieties in the neurilematic disposition occur prin- cipally in the nerves which are distributed to the proper organs of sensation, f 1*/, The olfactory nerve is soft, pulpy, and destitute of neurilema, from its origin in the sylvian fissure, to the gray bulbous enlargement which terminates its passage in the cranium ; but as soon as it reaches the ca- naliculi or grooves of the ethmoid bone, and be- gins to be distributed through the nasal anfractuo- * Reil, ibid, chap. i. t By the term " proper organs of sensation" is under- stood those of sight, hearing, smell, and taste, which are confined to a fixed spot in the system.

SEROUS MEMBRANE. 757 on each side by thin transparent filamentous membrane, which is in truth the arachnoid pas- sing from the falciform process of the dura mater to the free surface of the pia mater, covering the commutual surfaces of the hemispheres; and the same may be seen at the lower margin of the small or cerebellic falciform process. In the third place, at the inner margin of the transverse por- tion or tentorium, the transparent pellicle of the dura mater may be traced passing to the pia ma- ter of the brain above, and of the cerebellum be- low. The same arrangement may be demonstrat- ed in the vertebral cavity, in which it further co- vers the serrated membrane, (ligamentum denticu- latum.) In short, while the dura mater is proper to the inner surface of the scull, and the pia mater to the surfaces of the brain, the arachnoid mem- brane is common to both, and invests not only the free surface of the pia mater, as is usually stated, but the inner surface of the dura mater. The arachnoid has a still more extended distri- bution. After covering the free or inner surface of the pia mater, it follows the course of that mem- brane into the central surface of the brain, and covers the upper or unadlierent surface of the se- veral divisions of the choroid plexus. This is de- monstrated by the same process by which the continuity of the plexus with the pia mater is established. From the foregoing description it results that the arachnoid membrane possesses in arrange-

350 GENERAL ANATOMY. I am now to trace the direction of the com- ponent fibres of the latter parts. These are con- nected below, above, and behind, with so many- important parts, that it is requisite to compre- hend several parts under the general denomina- tion of System of the limhs. After the example of Reil, we begin fi-om the head of the spinal chord; {medulla oblongata.) This part consists in the human adult of six emi- nences, three on each side of the mesial plane;â€”i the jiyramidal or pyrijhrm eminences before, the restiform bodies behind, and the olivary eminen- ces on each side. Of these the olivary eminences are to be viewed as the most important, since by each containing a ciliary or moriform nucleus, {corpus ciliare, c. dentatum, c. moriforme, c. rhom- ioideum,) they make an approach in structure to the character of the cerebellum. The pyriform or pyramidal bodies are important in another light. Varoli, who has the merit of first examining with attention what is termed the base of the brain, traced longitudinal fibres in these bodies passing upwards through the body, named after him Pons F'arolii, the annular protuberance, (protuberantia annularis; Willis ; nodus cere- bri; Rau;) towards the limbs and substance of the brain. By Vieussens and Morgagni the fact of this arrangement was afterwards verified ; and it has been fully confirmed by the observations of Reil on the adult brain, and by those of Tiede- mann in the foetal organ.

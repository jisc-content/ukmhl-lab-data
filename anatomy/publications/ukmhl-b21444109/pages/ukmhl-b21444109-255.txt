LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 233 ascribed to lymphatics. Previous to his time Schre- ger, in different experiments, observed the first of these qualities in consequence of the application not only of acids, butter of antimony, and alco- hol, but even of hot water and cold air. Similar contractions and relaxations have been induced by mechanical irritation.* Such phenomena are observed not only during life, but even after death; and if we add to this, that the thoracic duct is often after death large and flaccid, though empty, but in the living body is almost always contracted and scarcely visible, and that a portion of it included between two ligatures and punctured, quickly expels its contents, it may be inferred, according to Tiedemann and Beclard, that the lymphatic tissue possesses a considerable degree of this vital or organic property. Section II. The lymphatic vessels have been supposed to perform an important part in the formation of the diseases incident to the animal body. In addition to the ordinary causes of disease which affect all organic substances, the several de- rangements of property or function to which they are liable have been supposed to exert a powerful influence on other tissues and oi'gans, and on their functions.

63 ADIPOSE TISSUE. the renal fat is described in the fourth vokune of the Transactions of the College of Physicians, by Dr Thomas Turner. 2. Hemorrhage.—Effusion of blood into the adipose tissue is not very common. It is observ- ed in the same circumstances nearly in which it oc- curs in the filamentous tissue. Thus it has been seen in land and sea scurvy. Huxham observed it in fevers with petechial eruptions.

And the Breslau Collections contain cases in which the human body weighed 580 and 600 pounds. In females and in eunuchs it is more abun- dant than in males ; in females deprived of the ovaries it is more abundant than in those possess-

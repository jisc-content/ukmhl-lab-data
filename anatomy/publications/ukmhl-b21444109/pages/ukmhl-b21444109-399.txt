377 BRAIN. formation of matter in a distinct cavity appears not so common in this form of the disease as in another which I am soon to mention. An abscess is not very frequently remarked under such cir- cumstances, unless when a foreign body, as a bul- let, a stone, or a piece of bone has been driven into the brain. This process gives rise to intense headach, delirium, and intolerance of light, quick- ly succeeded by convulsions, coma, and death. Of the effect of morbid poisons in inducing cere- bral inflammation more or less acute, an example is found in the severe form of fever prevalent in jails and camps. In several examples of this disease abscesses of the brain have been found, (Pringle); and it is often possible to trace the process from the first marks of injection to the complete formation of purulent matter. 2. Encephalia Siihacuta. (Pulpy destruction ; ramollissement, Rostan, Lallemand, &c.) Subacute orchronic inflammation of the brain is greatlymore common. Its anatomical characters are much the same as those of the acute form ; but the longer duration of the process gives rise to modifications which the pathologist should distinguish. At first a part of the brain becomes more or less red and vascular. As this goes on, it passes succes- sively into crimson, violet or purple, brown, or claret colour, while the consistence of the part is much diminished. A shade of green announces the formation of purulent fluid; and in propor- tion as this process continues before life is extinct,

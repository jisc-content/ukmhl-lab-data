207 SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. matter exhaled consists not of the usual watery fluid, but of pure blood, constituting several forms of the disease termed hemorrhage. This bloody- exhalation may take place either in the exhalations termed excrementitial, or in those termed recre- mentitial. a.'To the first head are to be referred those he- morrhages from the skin which are sometimes ob- served, and those from mvicous membranes, which are very frequent during congestion of their ca- pillary system. In the lungs, for example, no- thing is more common than exudation of blood from the bronchial membrane during catarrh or bronchial inflammation. In such circumstances it is generally small in quantity, {h(Enioptoe,) and unlike the copious and irresistible discharge of pulmonary apoplexy. It is still more distinct in hemoptysis, in which considerable quantities of blood issue from the surface of the bronchial membrane without breach or laceration, and consequently from the orifices of vessels by a process analogous to exhalation. (Bichat.) Is it also by exhalation that the copious discharge of pulmonary apoplexy takes place ? On this point facts are wanting. In hemorrhage from any point of the gastro- intestinal membrane the blood is exhaled in the same manner.

739 SEROUS MEMBRANE. any point which he finds most convenient for the purpose. Commencing with this understanding, from the circumference of the spot termed root of the lungs, the membrane may be traced first along the internal surface of the chest formed by the ribs and intercostal muscles, forwards to the ster- num, upwards to the first rib and apex of the tho- racic cavity, and downwards to the diaphragmatic insertions, and over the surface of that muscle, and the outer surface of the pericardium again to the circumference of the root or connection of the lungs. From this point again it may be traced over the surface and between the lobes of these organs, both of which, as already stated, are thus situate on the outside of the pleura. The course first described is that of the unreflected or exterior division of the pleura. The second, or that over the organ covered, is the course of the inflected or doubled portion of the membrane, which is thus necessarily smaller, and less exten- sive than the former. The arrangement thus sketched, which may be easily shown to be applicable to all the serous membranes, demonstrates their twofold character of lining the walls of a cavity and covering the organs contained. From an idea of this property the older anatomists applied to them the epithet of memhrancB succingentes. In tracing the course of the serous membranes, the anatomist observes, that they present produc- tions which float with more or less freedom in the cavity formed by the free surface, and which may

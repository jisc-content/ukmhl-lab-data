GENERAL ANATOMY. 440 fied by the researches of subsequent inquirers. Greding, whom I have already mentioned as hav- ing found the brain in a large proportion of cases softer than natural, found it in thirty-nine cases natural in consistence, firm, or even exceeding the natural firmness.* He thinks, however, that this difference is more in word than reality. Of the thirty-seven cases inspected by Haslam, in nine the brain was unusually firm, in one (34) remark- ably so, and in one (29) elastic.f In all the cases given by Dr Marshall, except two, again, amount- ing to fifteen, the brain was unusually firm and generally elastic. I The cause of this change, and the means by which it is effected, are entirely unknown. It is conjectured that it is a result of inflammation ; and it may be admitted as a proof of this, that the brain is almost invariably penetrated with numerous loaded capillaries, and that more or less effusion of serous fluid is found beneath the arach- noid membrane and in the cavities. These, how- ever, might be effects of the induration, or at least of the concomitant capillary injection. M. Serres has seen cases of cerebral injection and hemor- rhage causing apoplectic symptoms terminate in * Adversaria Medico-Practica. Ludwig. Tom. ii. p.

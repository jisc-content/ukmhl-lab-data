542 GENERAI, ANATOMY, 111 the vertebral column the bodies of the ver- tebrae and the spinous plates are formed; and mi- nute specks are beginning in the site of the trans- verse processes. In the skull, the parietal bones are well-formed shells of bone, though very deficient at the mesial plane, the anterior margin, and the upper anterior angle. The pericranium is distinctly membranous and vascular; and the red jelly-like fluid noticed by Mr Howship is exterior to this membrane. At the period of birth, the cylindrical bones con- tain tubular canals filled with a colourless glairy fluid, and terminating in the surface of ossifica- tion. As the bones previous to this period are homogeneous, and contain no distinct medullary cavity, but present in their interior a soft or loose bony texture, it is reasonable to suppose that the developement of the longitudinal canals is connected with the formation of the medullary cavity. At birth in the femur may be distin- guished a medullary cavity beginning to be form- ed, about half a line broad, but still very imper- fect. After birth the two processes of the formation of tubular canals and medullary cavity go on si- multaneously ; and at the same rate nearly the outer part of the cylindrical bones acquires a more dense and compact appearance. The epiphyses, also, which are in the shape of grayish jelly-like masses, begin to present grains and points of bone. Preliminary to this, Mr Howship represents them, 4

GENERAL ANATOMY. 344 rangement of each is mutually connected, are now to become the object of examination. The convoluted surface first claims attention. The colour of this is well known to be of an ash- gray, passing in certain parts to pale brown. In whatever part the substance of the convolutions be examined, they never present any appearance of linear or fibrous arrangement. I have often examined the convoluted substance of the human brain after induration in alcohol and dilute nitric acid; and I never could recognize the distinct fi- brous disposition observed in other parts of the organ. A portion of brain, hardened in the man- ner now mentioned, breaks with a small conchoidal fracture, and an uneven granular subordinate sur- face. The surface thus exposed presents, how- ever, a very determinate aspect, which it is easy to recognize after repeated trials. It is ash-gray and without lustre. It is rough, and consists, when minutely examined, of roundish grains aggregated together. The direction of the fracture is more at right angles to the convoluted surface than obliquely or parallel to it. In some instances even it is possible to recognize depressed marks per- pendicular to the surface, sending off angularly like branches smaller depressed marks, meeting similar ramifications from other perpendicular de- pressions. I have often attempted to determine, by break- ing portions of brain in every direction, whether this appearance is uniform ; but I cannot say that

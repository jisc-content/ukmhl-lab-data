583 BONE. as its name seems to indicate, of an adipose na- ture. They vary from gelatinous, oleaginous, and meliceritious to atheromatous and sebaceous, irre- gularly intermixed with spiculce and lamellce of bone. Their progressive enlargement causes by pressure and absorption destruction of the conti- guous bone. This is the process which by Pal- letta is termed ossivorous. b. Hematoma, (blood-cyst.)—Of all theexamples of this disease (abscessus smiguineus,) collected by Palletta, one only I find originated in the sub- stance of a bone,—the tibia in its upper epiphysis, which was consumed by carious absorption. (Case 22.) In several, however, the tumour, though originating in the adjoining tissues, had produced by progressive encroachment the same effect. c. Fungus HcBinatodes.—This is the same as the fungous medullary exostosis above noticed. Whe- ther it originates in this manner, or from the con- tiguous textures, it produces the same erosive de- struction of the bones. An instance of this ori- ginating in the peritonaeum I saw destroy the bones of the pelvis, and reduce the upper half of the right OS fetnoris to a thin net-work of bone, which broke asunder a few days before death. 12. Scirrho-Carcinoma.—Though this seems never to originate in the osseous texture, it often spreads to it from the contiguous one. Thus most surgeons have seen cancer of the lip or scirrhus of the parotid affect the lower jaw; cancer of the fe- male breast erode the ribs; cancer of the penis affect the ossa pubis; and cancer of the eye or eye-

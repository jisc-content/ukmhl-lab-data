MUSCULAR TISSUE. 497 deep in the centre, in the inner surface of the left ventricle, which was hypertrophied, and at length ruptured. y. Myositis emoUiens.—To this head may be re- ferred the softened or pulpy state occasionally observed in the substance of the heart in weak extenuated subjects liable to fainting-fits, and also in those cut off by fever. The muscular fibres then assume a light fawn colour or pale yellow, like the dead leaf, become flabby and friable, and so easily lacerable as scarely to sustain handling. By Laennec this is regarded as the result of error of assimilation or defective nutrition; while Bouillaud ascribes it to inflammation. One variety of softening appears to be the consequence of inflammation, and may be considered as gan- grene of the heart. Most usually, however, it is the result of imperfect nutrition of the organ dur- ing disease, either chronic or subacute. 2. Hypertrophy.—There is reason to believe that the condition described as hypertrophy of muscles is mere enlargement depending on chronic inflammation. It is certainly quite different from the enlargement occasioned by exercise, to which it has been erroneously compared. In the heart and bladder, in which it has been most frequently found, not only is the muscular substance thickened and enlarged, but it is rendered hard, firm, and in some parts almost cartilaginous. In the early stage the colour is simply brown ; subsequently it acquires in certain parts a leaden gray tint, which seems to 1 i

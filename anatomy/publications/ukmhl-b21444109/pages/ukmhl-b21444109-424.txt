402 GENERAL ANATOMY. Serous fluid exhaled from the capillaries has been supposed to constitute a peculiar form of apoplexy entirely distinct from that termed san- guine, and depending on extravasation of blood. In the writings of Morgagni and others are cases in which the effusion of serous fluid was associa- ted with distinct and general vascular injection. Cases of this description are referred by Stoll to the head of sanguine apoplexy, in which the patho- logical character is injection, or accumulation, which is at once the cause of the serous effusion and of the apoplectic symptoms. * It was after- wards demonstrated by Portal, that serous infiltra- tion and effusion invariably arise from the same state of the vessels as hemorrhage ; f and this inference has since been confirmed by the obser- vations of Dr Cheyne, Dr Abercrombie, of M. Serres, and others. In short, if from any cause the circulation within the head becomes unusually slow, and the vessels of the brain become inordi- nately distended, either red blood or serous fluid * " In apoplecticorum secto cerebro frequenter leguntur vasa cerebri xangume turgida, et serum multum effusum. Hujus generis apoplexiae plerumque serosos audiunt. Veri- us sanguinecB appellarentur; accumulatus enim intra caput sanguis, et seri efFusi, et apoplexiae causa est: serum ipsum effusum ad concausas perlinet serins accedentes, quceve mor- bum ipsum non produxere, altamen productiim augent."

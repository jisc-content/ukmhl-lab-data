The hands and fingers are complete ; but the phalanges consist of minute semi-hard grains, enclosed in periosteum, which forms a general sac to them, and to the in- termediate connecting parts. The middle and unguinal phalanges can scarcely be called osseous. The femur, like the humerus, is an osseous cylin- der between two jelly-like epiphyses, enveloped in loosely adhering periosteum. The tibia and fibula like the radius and ulna. The metatarsal bones are cylindrical pieces, firm, but not very hard. The first phalanx of the toes is complete; the other two, though the toes are fully formed, are much of the consistence of cartilage. The carpal and tarsal bones are in the state of the epiphyses, but of a gray colour. In this state of the osseous system, the perios- teum, which is continuous, and appears to make one membrane with the capsular ligaments and the deep-seated portions of the fascia, adheres to the bone chiefly by arteries and filamentous pro- ductions ; and so loose is this connection, that a probe may be inserted beneath it, and carried round or inwards, unless where these connections are situate. Another point where the periosteum adheres firmly is at muscular insertions. Thus, in the foetus before me, it adheres to the humerus most firmly at the insertion of the deltoid, and to the femur at that of the giutceus; and at these parts the bone is already rough.

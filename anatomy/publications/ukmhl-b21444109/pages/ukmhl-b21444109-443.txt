In the foregoing account of the state of the brain giving rise to apoplectic symptoms, I have said nothing of that loss of voluntary muscular power known under the name of palsy, (paraly- sis, resolutio 7iervormn;) because I suppose it to depend on the same state of the cerebral capil- laries which causes the general apoplectic affec- tion, which it either precedes, accompanies, or follows; or on that state of the brain or spinal chord which I have already described as termi- nating in pulpy destruction. In attempting to establish clearly the anatomical characters of pal- sy, two circumstances merit particular attention. First, several cases of apoplectic death are pre- ceded by paralytic affection of one side, more or less extensive, in the successive forms of distortion of one side of the face, loss of speech, loss of power in an arm, a leg, or the entire side. When these phenomena are followed by coma and death, necro- scopic inspection shows as in apoplexy, capillary injection with or without extravasation, and gene- rally more or less destruction of brain. The com- mencement of the morbid process in this instance is doubtless the same capillary injection of part of the organ, which in a more exquisite degree produces the comatose state. Secondly, Though there are not a few instances in which an attack

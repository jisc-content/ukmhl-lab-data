I am now to ad- vance such evidence as may show, that little doubt can be entertained that this is the true pathology of the subcutaneous tubercle. Hard, painful, pisiform tumours beneath the skin are first mentioned by Cheselden, who met with three cases in which he employed excision, without being aware that they might be seated in the nerves or their coverings. * Camper is, so far as I am aware, the first anatomist who remarks the occasional occurrence of minute hard tubercles, not larger than a pea, in the cutaneous nerves; where he represents them as giving rise to excru- ciating darting pains night and day, admitting of no alleviation from external remedies. Of this kind he met with one in the musculo-cutaneous nerve of a woman at Franequer, and another in the knee of a woman at Amsterdam. Both he re- moved by excision, and found them white inter- nally, of gristly hardness, elastic, and seated with- in the neurilema. f The next notice of this disease is by Dr Bisset, who observed it in the form of an irregularly-oval tumour, the size of a filbert, on the outside of the left leg, six inches above the outer ancle, also in a * Anatomy of the Human Body.

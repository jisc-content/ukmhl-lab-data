806 GENERAL ANATOMY. The same views may be applied to the synovial linings of the tendinous sheaths, which are equal- ly to be viewed as shut sacs. Attached to the free surface of each synovial membrane is a peculiar fringe-like substance, which was long supposed to be an apparatus of glands (glands of Havers) for secreting synovial fluid. It is now known that these fringes are merely puckered folds of synovial membrane, and that, although synovia is abundantly secreted by them, this depends merely on the great extent of surface which their puckered arrangement neces- sarily presents. This arrangement is easily de- monstrated by immersing an articulation contain- ing the fringed processes in clear water, when they are unfolded and made to float, and show their connections, figure, and terminations. They are analogous to the free processes of serous mem- branes, and like them are double, and contain adipose matter. The synovial sheaths (burses mucosae,) are very numerous, and are generally found in every tendon which is exposed to frequent or extensive motion. Though the fluid prepared by these membranes has been examined by Margueron, Fourcroy, John Davy, Orfila, and other chemists, it cannot be said that very accurate results have been yet given of its chemical composition. It is said to contain water, albumen, incoagulable matter, regarded as mucilaginous gelatine, a ropy matter, and salts of soda, lime, and some uric acid. 3

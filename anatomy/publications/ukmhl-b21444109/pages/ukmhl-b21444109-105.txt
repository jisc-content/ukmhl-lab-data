ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 85 systematically explained by Scarpa, and after- wards by Cooper and Hodgson. The importance of this arrangement in facilitating the motions of the circulation, in obviating the effects of local im- pediment in any vessel or set of vessels, and in ena- bling the surgeon to tie an arterial trvnik when wounded, affected Avitli aneurism or any other dis- ease, has been clearly established by these authors. Their researches have shown that there is not a sin- gle vessel which may not be tied with full confi- dence in the powers of the collateral circulation. Even the aorta has been found obstructed in the human subject; (Graham,) and a ligature has been put on its abdominal portion. (Cooper.) To ascertain the several modes in which arte- ries terminate has been a problem of much inte- rest to the physiologist, and of no small difficulty to the anatomist. The alleged terminations as believed to be established, are miimtely and ela- borately enumerated by Haller, who, however, multiplied them too much according to the mo- dern acceptation of the term. 1. The first undoubted termination of arteries is immediately in veins. It is unnecessary to ad- duce in support of this fact the long list of ob- servers enumerated by Haller. It is sufficient to say that it was clearly established by the microsco- pical observations of Leuwenhoeck, Cowper, and Baker, by Haller himself, and by Spallanzani in his beautiful experiments on the circulation of the blood.

6 GENERAL ANATOMY. tivation of anatomy, and eminent for the perfection to which he carried the art of injecting, he was enabled to obtain more correct views than his pre- decessors of the arrangement of minute vessels in the interior of organs, and to demonstrate pecu- liarities of organization, which had escaped the scrutiny of previous anatomists. Scarcely a part pr texture of the human body eluded the pene- 1665. tration of his syringe ; and his discoveries were proportionally great. His researches on the lungs, on the vascular structure of the skin, of the bones and their epiphyses, of the spleen, of the glans pe- 1691. nis,the clitoris, and the womb, impregnated and un- impregnated, were sufficient to give him the repu- 1701. tationof a most able and accurate anatomist. These, however, were but a limited part of his anatomi- cal labours. He studied the minute structure of 17'5* the brain ; he demonstrated the organization of the choroid plexus; he described the state of the hair when affected with Polish plait; he proved the vascular structure of the teeth ; he injected the dura mater, the pleura, the pericardium, and peritoneum ; he investigated the structure of the synovial apparatus placed in the interior of the joints, and he discovered many curious particulars relating to the lacteals, the lymphatics, and the lymphatic glands. So assiduously, indeed, did Ruysch study by injection the tissues and organs of the animal body, that it is less easy to say what % he did than what he neglected. We are indebted

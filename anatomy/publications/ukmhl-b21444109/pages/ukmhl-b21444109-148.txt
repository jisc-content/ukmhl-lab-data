126 GENERAL ANATOMY. venee cavce, though conveying the blood to the pulmonic division of the heart, as the aorta con- veys it from it, do not, however, correspond with the latter either in situation or in dependent branches. The a%ygos and the demia&ygos veins in like manner, which receive the intercostal veins, have no concomitant artery, but open into the superior cava, to which it may be viewed as an ap- pendage. Lastly, The portal vein which is form- ed of the united trunks of the splenic, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric veins, cor- responds to no individual arterial trunk, and forms of itself a peculiar arrangement in the ve- nous system. Some anatomists have dwelt much on the more superficial and less sheltered situation of the veins than of the arteries. Upon this point no very positive inferences can be established. In the ex- tremities the former are in general most super- ficial ; but in the interior of the body, especially in the chest, the venous trunks are quite as deep- seated as the arterial. The course of the venous canals is in general 'Pore rectilineal and less tortuous than that of the arteries. In no part of the venous system is such an inflection presented as that which the internal carotid makes in the carotic canal. The general result of this is, that a set of venous tubes is shorter than a corresponding set of arterial ones. The trunks also are less inflected than the branches. 4.

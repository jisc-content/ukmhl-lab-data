603 SKIN. The colour varies, but the root is always whitish and transparent, and softer than the rest; the fix- ed or adhering part of the root is almost fluid. When hair is decolorized, it becomes transparent and brittle, and presents a peculiar silvery-white co- lour; and as hairs of this kind are few or abundant, it gives the aspect of gray, hoary, or white hair. The bulb, though visible in a hair plucked out by the root, is too small in human hair to be mi- nutely examined; and Chirac, Gaultier, and Gor- don, have therefore described its structure and ap- pearances from the bulbs of the whiskers of large animals, the seal for example, in which it is much more distinct. According to researches of this kind, every bulb forms a sort of sac or follicle, which consists of two tunics, an inner one, ten- der, vascular, and embracing closely the root of the hair; and an outer, which is firmer and less vascular, and surrounds the inner one, while it adheres to the filamentous tissue and the inner surface of the corion. When the hair issues from the bulb, it passes through an appropriate canal of the corion, which is always more or less oblique, but which, as has been already said, it fills com- pletely ; and it afterwards passes in a similar man- ner through the scarf-skin. Nervous filaments have been traced into the bulbs of the whiskers of the seal by Rudolphi and the younger Andral. The bulb or follicle, in short, is organic, and forms by secretion the inorganic hair. The structure of hair itself appears to be either so simple, or so incapable of being further eluci-

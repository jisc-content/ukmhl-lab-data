BRAIN, 303 be conveniently divided into the following five re- gions ; 1. The commntual or dichotomous; 2. The lateral-superior, or convex; 3. The antero-inferior, or frontal; 4s. The medio-inferior, or spheno-tem- poral; 5. The posterior or cerebellic region of the convoluted surface. The first of these regions of the convoluted sur- face is easily understood. Plane in its surface, of a shape nearly semicircular, it forms the central boundary of each hemisphere, corresponds to the falciform or dichotomous portion of the hard membrane, {[Ji^my^ axkti^}], meninx dm-a,) by which it is separated from the similar surface of the op- posite hemisphere. Before and behind it extends from the superior to the inferior surface of the brain ; but a considerable portion of its middle is terminated by the upper surface of the object named middle band, {mesolohe, corpus callosum,) which lies between the two hemispheres. It is contained between the semicircular and the recti- linear margins. The second region of the convoluted surface is extensive, and occupies the whole of the anterior, upper, lateral, and posterior parts of the hemi- sphere, from their anterior to their posterior extre- mity, and from the semicircular margin to a line which extends between these extremities along the lateral borders of the organ. The antero-inferior or frontal, is that region of the convoluted surface which rests on the horizon- tal part of the frontal and ethmoid bones, and

74 GENERAL ANATOMY. here considerably thinner. In this respect it va- ries in different regions. Though in general less dense and abundant as the arteries recede from the heart, it is thicker cateris paribus in those of the lower than in those of the upper extremities. In the vertebral and internal carotid arteries, and in those distributed in the substance of the liver, spleen, &c., it is thinner than in vessels of the same size in the muscular interstices. The nature of this tissue has been the subject of much controversy. It was long believed to be muscular, and to possess the properties of muscu- lar fibre. Bichat showed that the arguments by which this opinion was supported are inconclu- sive, and that the arterial tissue has very few qua- lities in common with the muscular. The circum- stances from which he derived his proofs were its physical and physiological properties. The arguments derived from the physical pro- perties of this tissue are chiefly the following. The arterial tissue is close, elastic, fragile, and easily divided by ligature ; muscular fibz*e is more loose in structure, by no means elastic, and, instead of being divided or cut by ligature as artery is, undergoes a sort of strangulation. The action of alcohol, diluted acids, and caloric, by means of hot fluids, which are not corrosive, affords a proof of the chemical difference of these animal substances. All of them produce in the arterial tunic a species of shrivelling or crispation, which seems to depend on more complete coagulation of one of the che-

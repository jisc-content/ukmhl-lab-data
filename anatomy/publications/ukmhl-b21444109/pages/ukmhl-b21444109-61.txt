I ILABJEMTOUS Oli CELLULAll TISSUE. 41 pkijma of the ancients. JProctitis, Proctalgia and Clunesia of the nosologists. Suppuration gangre- neuse of the French. Described by Pott in his 2d section on Fistula.ani, p. 49. Case given by Hunter in his 3d chapter, section xiv., on the use of the adhesive inflammation. Abscess juxta anum of Mr James, p. 189.)

This inflammation may spread along the urethral and scrotal filamentous tissue, and form the ure- thral abscess {ahscessus juxta urethram) of Mr James. Of this an instructive example is related by John Hunter at the passage above referred to.

" It is not so circumscribed as the former; nor does it spread along the skin like the latter.

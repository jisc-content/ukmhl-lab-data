MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 717 that this inflammation is confined chiefly to the labia, the nymphce, the clitoris, and hymen ; and it does not seem to af- fect the vagina. 2. Hcemorrhage In the mucous membranes hemorrhage is frequent; and though none of them can be said to be exempt from it, it is most common in the Schneiderian or nasal mem- brane, in the pulmonic, intestinal, and uterine mucous sm*- faces. In the hemorrhagic form of land-scurvy {purpura hcemorrhagica'), with the bloody spots on the outer surface of the corion of simple purpura, are combined spots and he- morrhage from almost all the mucous surfaces. Of the he- morrhages of the mucous membranes the following table may be given:â€” Epistaxis, Sioniacacc' Hamoptysis, Hcematemesis, Mclccna; Dysentery Hcemorrfiois, Hocmaturia. Nasal passages, Mouth, Bronchial membrane. Stomach, Ileum and colon. Rectum, Bladder, Urethra, Womb. Pneumonorrhagia. Gastrorrhagia. Entcrorrhagia. Proctorrhagia. Cystirrhagia. Urethrorrltagia. Menorrhagia. In these several I'egions of the mucous surfaces, the pa- thology of hemorrhage, which has been already partially considered, * is much the same. The discharge of blood or bloody fluid from any of the mucous membranes is not so much a disease of itself as one of the effects of some degree or variety of the inflammatory process. Thvis blood is dis- charged from the bronchial membrane during bronchial in- flammation; from the gastric mucous membrane during vas- cular congestion of the stomach; from the intestinal during the congestion of dysentery ; and from that of the rectum during the vascular state attendant on hemorrhois. In these circum- stances, the blood, whether pure or mingled, as it often is with mucous, muco-purulent or puriform fluid, oozes from the mucous membranes without destruction of tissue, or rup- ture of vessels, or, in the language of the physiologist, is exhaled.

661 MUCOUS MEMBRANE. Thus, in those regions "in which the mucous membranes coalesce with the periosteum, forming- fibro-mucous membranes, e. g. in the facial sinuses, the tympanal cavity and the mastoid cells, the co- lour is pale-blue, or approaching to light-lilac. In the bladder, in the large intestines, in the excre- tory ducts, in general, though pale, this colouring becomes more vivid. In the pulmonic mucous membrane it is a slate-blue, verging to pale pink. In the stomach, duodenum, small intestines, and the vagina, it becomes still more marked. In the uterus it varies according to the period or the in- tervals of menstruation. If these vessels be examined in the gastro-en- teric mucous membrane, in which they are pro- bably most numerous, they are found to consist of an extensive net-work of capillaries divided to an infinite degree of minuteness, mutually intersect- ing and spreading over the upper or outer surface of the mucous corion. This vascular net-work, though demonstrated by Ruysch, Albinus, Haller, and Bichat, has been very beautifully represented in the delineations of Bleuland, who thinks he has traced their minute ramifications into the villi, as above stated. These minute vessels are derived from larger ones, which creep through the sub- mucous cellular tissue, and which are observed to penetrate the mucous corion to be finally distri- juted at its exterior surface. The substance of this membrane itself appears to receive few or no vessels. It is well known that the vessels which supply the mucous surfaces enter by the serous

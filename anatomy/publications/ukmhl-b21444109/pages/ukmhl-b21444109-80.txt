60 GENERAL ANATOMY. tigrade. Elaine, on the contrary, though colour- less, or at most of a yellow tint, and lighter than water, is fluid at a temperature of from 17° to 18° centigrade, and is greatly more soluble in alcohol. Gf this substance marrow appears to be merely a modification; and the membranous cavities or me- dullary membrane in which it is contained may be viewed as an intra-osseous adipose tissue. Little doubt can be entertained that animal fat is the result of a process of secretion. But it is no easy matter to determine the mode in which this is effected. Malpighi, departing, however, from strict observation, imagined a set of ducts issuing from glands, in which he conceived the fat to be elaborated and prepared. To this he appears to have been led by his study of the lymphatic glands, and inability to comprehend how the process of secretion could be performed by arteries only. This doctrine, however, was overthrown by the strong arguments which Ruysch derived from his injections ; and Malpighi himself afterwards ac- knowledged its weakness and renounced it. In short, neither the glands nor the ducts of the adi- pose membrane have ever been seen. Winslow, though willing to adopt the notion of Malpighi, admits, however, that the particular or- gan by which the fat is separated from the blood was unknown. Haller, on the contrary, aware of the permeability of the arteries, and their direct communication with the cells of the adipose tissue, and trusting to the testimony of Malpighi, Ruysch,

268 GENERAL ANATOMY. Reil, who derived his conchisions from the result of dehcate and successful injections, perhaps over- rated the quantity of blood which in the sound state they convey ; for it is quite certain, that, in the healthy state, hardly any red blood enters the nervous tissue, as may be easily shown by expos- ing the sciatic nerve of a dog or rabbit. No good chemical analysis of nervous matter has yet been published. Every chemical exami- nation of it has been conducted on the assumption that it is analogous to cerebral matter. Of this, however, there is no direct proof. In the analysis by Vauquelin the neurilematic covering appears not to have been detached,—a proceeding always necessary to obtain correct results in this inquiry. The effects of acids and alcohol show that it con- tains albuminous matter; but beyond this it is im- possible at present to make any precise statements. This description may communicate an idea of the structure of the nervous chord in general. In particular situations this structure is considerably modified. The modifications to which we allude occur under two forms—ganglions (Die knoten ;) and plexuses (Die Nervengeflechte.) Every ganglion consists essentially of three parts; 1st, an exterior covering; 2d, a collection of mi- nute nervous filaments; and, 3d, a quantity of peculiar cellular or filamentous texture, by which these filaments are connected, and which consti- tutes the great mass of the ganglion. The ganglions are of two kinds, the spinal or

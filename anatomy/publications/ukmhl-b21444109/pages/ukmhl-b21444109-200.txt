GENERAL ANATOMY. 178 weakness of the parts, or the influence of external morbific causes, ^th. Inflammation is a local ac- tion confined to the capillaries of one tissue, or at most of one organ and contiguous tissues; and while the structure and fimctions of the organ may be completely impaired, those of others remain un- altered. In fever, on the contrary, the capillaries of all the tissues and of every organ are affected ; and while no individual organ is much affected at the commencement, every organ suffers a little in the general disorder of the capillar}^ system. 5th, Inflammation gives rise to albuminous exuda- tion, suppuration, ulceration, and in certain parts to serous, or sero-purulent effusion. In fever the morbid state of the capillaries terminates in com- plete destruction or disorganization of their organic extremities, and the consequent oozing of blood from the surface of the several membranes and organs. In conclusion, though it may be regarded as estabhshed, that during the morbid process of fever the whole capillaiy system is unduly dis- tended and loaded with an inordinate quantity of blood, which really moves more slowly and im- perfectly than during health, Ave have no facts which enable us to determine what induces this peculiar and excessive accimiulation. Much has been lately said of congestion, and especially ve- nous congestion. The state of the capillary sys- tem which I have attempted to describe is that of congestion or accumulation ; and so far the hypo- thesis of congestion is intelligible. Of the existence

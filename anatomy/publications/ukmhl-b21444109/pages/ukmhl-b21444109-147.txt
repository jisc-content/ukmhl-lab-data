VEIN, VENOUS TISSUE. this greater size depends on the increase of dilata- tion resulting from removing the pressure of super- incumbent parts. In young animals also the differ- ence between the size of the veins and their cor- responding arteries is so trifling as to be scarcely discernible. This would show that something is to be ascribed to the incessant operation of a dilating force increasing uniformly with the dura- tion of life. Upon the whole, it is chiefly on the ground of their larger numerical arrangement that the veins collectively can be said to be more capacious than the arteries. On this subject some observations of Bichat are entitled to attention. * 3. The veins in general accompany the arteries. The venous trunk placed contiguous to the arte- rial in the same sheath is divided into branches at the same points, and is distributed into the substance of organs much in the same manner. From this arrangement, however, certain devia- tions are observed in particular regions. Thus, in the brain, neither the internal carotid, nor the basilar artery, nor their large branches, are ac- companied with veins. The small branches only have corresponding veins, which, as they unite to form large ones, pour their blood into the venous canals termed sinuses, the arrangement of Avhich is unlike any other part of the venous system. In the chest also a different disposition of the venous from the arterial tubes is observed. The * Anatomic Generale, Tome I. p. 378.

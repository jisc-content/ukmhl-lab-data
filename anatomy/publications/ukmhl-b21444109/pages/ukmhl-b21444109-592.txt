568 GENERAL ANATOMY. generation is imperfect or altogether deficient. (Weidmann.) In some instances also, in which necrosis affects one portion only of the internal sur- face of a cylindrical bone, reproduction appears not to be effected. The outer part of the bone then becomes soft, and at length carious, and forms apertures (foramina grandia, Troja,) {cloa- C(By Weidmann,) similar to those in new osseous cases, through which a sequestrum is discharged. (Weidmann, p. 31.) Regeneration is most frequent in the diapJiy- ses of the cylindrical bones. Many cases of re- production of the humerus, the femur, and espe- cially the tibia, are on record. Of the ulna three only are mentioned, and of the radius only one, of the clavicle one, and of the scapula one. Of the lower jaw regeneration, either partial or total, has been recorded by various observers. The flat bones of the scull are very rarely re- generated ; and perhaps it would be difficult to produce an authentic and unequivocal example, unless that given by Weidmann (pi. xii.) be ad- mitted. Mr Russell, however, states that he has seen instances of apertures of the cranial bones being supplied by solid matter which, to his observa- tion, possessed all the qualities of solid bone. This nevertheless resembles more the reproduc- tion after fracture than that after necrosis. The short or cuboid bones appear never to be reproduced. ^. Spina Ventosa. Paedarthrocace,â€”Inflamma-

GENERAI, ANATOMY. 336 edge, however, is terminated by the cerebral limb of that side; and the lower edge meets that of the opposite one, and is connected to it by a portion of brain, which, examined in this manner, has re- ceived no name, but forms the lower part of the middle ventricle. The portion of brain which cor- responds to it on the outside (base of the brain) has been named the bridge of Tarin. (Pons Tarini.) This is the triangular space between the limbs of the brain which has been called by Vicq-D'Azyr the pit of the oculo-muscular nerves. It may be named the triangular intercrural hollow. The posterior surface of the optic eminence is the most important, but the least understood. It is so intimately connected with the inferior, that they cannot be easily distinguished in description. Santorini, I believe, was the first who observed that the posterior part of the optic couch was ter- minated by a projection or process, which he named the Jointed or geniculate hody, and which, he had likewise the merit of observing, gives rise to the optic nerve. * More recently Malacarne re- * " Quod tamen per repetitas diligenterque institutas dis- quisitiones ab eadem potius membrana eos non proficisci, ssepius vidisse visus sum; verum turn ab eorum Thalamo- rum interiori parte, turn a quodam velut geniculato corpore circa eorundem Thalamorum posteriora locato adjimcloque, cujus corticalis seu cinerea interior substcintia est, medullaris et Candida exterior facies luculentius prodire, sum assecu- tus: Ad horum tamen exortus locum a latere prominentia- rum quod natiformes nuncupantur, conspicuus medullaris tractus transversim sic Thalamis conjungitur, ut vel in eo-

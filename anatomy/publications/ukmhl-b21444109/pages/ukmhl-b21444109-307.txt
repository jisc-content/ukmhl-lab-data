285 NERVOUS TISSUE, probably chronic inflammation of some part of their neurilematic covering. Patients who have undergone amputation some- times complain of acute pain in a single point of the stump, liable to aggravation when touched, and spreading up the limb in the course of the nerves. It is usual to ascribe such complaints to implication of the nerve in the cicatrix; but it is more likely that a minute branch has been in- cluded in the ligature of some of the vessels. In such circumstances it is manifest that a cause is given for the most severe and obstinate form of neurilematic inflammation. Lastly, I may notice, that to ttie same head is to be referred a painful gnawing sensation of contraction ascending up the arm from the finger, which I have seen follow the communication of the inflammation of whitloe to one of the small branches of the radial nerve. Ulceration of nervous tissue, though rare, may occur either after wound, laceration, or contusion of a nerve, as in the case of ligature, or in conse- quence of an ulcer of the contiguous parts spread- ing to the nerve. It does not appear to occur spontaneously after inflammation. 3. Division and Re-union; Excision or Re- movaly and Reproduction. When a nerve is cut across, no doubt can be entertained that it is again re-united. But it is questionable whether it is re- united by simple adhesion, by the growth of new nerve, or by the growth of new matter entirely different. The latter point has been a particular subject of inquiry to many anatomists and physi-

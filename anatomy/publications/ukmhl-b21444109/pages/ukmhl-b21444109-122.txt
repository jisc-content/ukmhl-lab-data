An artery may be punctured, perforated, cut longitudinally, divided partially or entirely across, or torn com- pletely asunder. In the first three cases the blood which escapes is injected into the filamentous sheath, and coagu- lating, prevents further effusion from the vessel. In a few hours the edges of the wound inflame, and, pouring out l5nTiph, are united by adhesion. In the case of small wounds, especially longitudi- nal, this union may be effected without oblitera- tion of the canal. But when the wound is large or oblique, if the inflammation is sufficient to ef- fect union and prevent further hemorrhage, so much lymph is effused, that in general, with the pressure and rest requisite, the opposite sides of the vessel adhere, and its canal is for some space obliterated.

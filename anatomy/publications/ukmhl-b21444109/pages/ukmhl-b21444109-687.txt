MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 663 ed partly to the latter cause, partly to the vascu- lar redness which the presence of foreign bodies occasions. * The pulmonary division of this mem- brane is of an ash-gray or dun colour, inclining to pale-blue or light red. These colours vary, never- theless, according to the facility or the difficulty with which the blood moves through the pulmo- nary capillary system. It is also freely supplied with blood-vessels derived chieflyfrom the bronchi- al arteries. These vessels, after accompanying the bronchial tubes and their successive subdivisions, divide into minute branches which penetrate the mucous corion, which here is white, dense, and fibrous, and after anastomosing with the capilla- ries of the pulmonary artery and veins, form a minute delicate net-work on the outer surface of the pulmonary mucous membrane. According to Reisseissen, to whom we are indebted for a careful examination of these vessels, a successful injection of them from the bronchial arteries, renders the whole mucous membrane of the bronchi entirely red to the unassisted eye. f The termination of arteries at the mucous sur- faces has at all times occupied the attention of anatomists and physiologists ; but it is unfortu- nately not a matter of sensible demonstration. * Observations on the vascular appearance in the Human Stomach, which is frequently mistaken for inflammation of that organ.

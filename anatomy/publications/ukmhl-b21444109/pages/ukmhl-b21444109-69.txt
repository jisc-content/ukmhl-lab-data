FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 49 The preternatural increase of the cellular se- rosity now mentioned is supposed to arise either from diminished absorption or increased exhala- tion. This point will be considered afterwards when speaking of the exhalants. 7. Emphysema. Pneumatosis spontanea et traumatica, Cullen. The filamentous tissue may be distended with air, which causes a uniform swelling, crepitating or emitting a crackling sound when pressed. The situations in which this aerial swelling may take place vary according to the cause by which it is produced. It may take place spontaneously (Baillie,) when it is commonly general, and is sup- posed to depend on a process of secretion from the blood-vessels. It may arise from rupture or la- ceration of the mucous membrane of the larynx or windpipe, (De Villars, Cheselden, Holyoke, O'Brien,) when the swelling appears chiefly over the face, neck, and upper part of the chest. It may succeed a broken rib, or any injury of the lungs, (Littre, Berger, William Hunter, Cheston, Leake, Gooch, Halliday,) when it appears some- times over the neck, face, and chest, sometimes over the chest and side only. It may arise from rupture of the bronchial membrane during violent efforts, (Blagden, Hicks, Simmons ;) and in this manner emphysema happens in puerperal women. Lastly, it may appear as an effect of gangrenous inflammation and mortification when it is confined solely to the affected limb. In the latter case the D

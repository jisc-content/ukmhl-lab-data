345 BRAIN. * Archiv. fur die Physiologie, neunter Band, p. 145. I have obtained satisfactory proof of the point. I am not unaware that Reil represents the intimate structure of the convolutions to be distinctly fi- brous. So far as 1 understand his description, I admit the fact of the conchoidal fracture which I have often verified; but I am not prepared to al- low that this arises, as he imagines, from the fi- brous matter being arranged in plates or leaves, which are folded and rolled together. * Upon the whole, the convoluted substance I regard as chiefly granular, but so arranged as to be more frangible in the direction perpendicular to its surface than otherwise. It is said to be more abundantly sup- plied with vessels than the white matter; (Ruysch, Albinus, Prochaska, and Soemmering ;) and in- deed a greater number of large vessels enters it all over, and especially at certain parts, e. g. the perforated space of the Sylvian fissure. It is not, however, absolutely and at all points more vas- cular than the white matter. The transition from the gray convoluted matter to the white inclosed, is in all parts of the hemispheres sudden and dis- tinct. It is more distinct, however, after indura- tion by immersion in alcohol or dilute acid, than in the recent brain. The only part of the convoluted surface which presents a distinct fibrous arrangement is that part of the Sylvian fissure which has been named by Reil the unciform bundle (der haakenformige Mark- biindel.) This, however, can scarcely be said to

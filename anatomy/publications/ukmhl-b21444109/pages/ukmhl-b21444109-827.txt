These cases are vaguely mentioned under the general title of ossification of the brain; but few of them are entitled to this character, for all of these originate in the mem- branes. The only authentic instance apparently of bony matter found in the substance of the brain unconnected with the membranes, is that delineated by Dr Hooper in his 12th engraving. The description, nevertheless, is not suffi- ciently minute to justify positive assertion. CHAPTER XXIV. Section I. Synovial Membrane ;—Mem.hrana Synovi- alis;—Sursee Mucosce. BiCHAT enumerates several circumstances in which he conceives that serous and synovial mem- brane differ from each other. Gordon, who doubts how far the distinctions are well founded as the basis of anatomical arrangement, admits, however, the following peculiarities. Synovial membrane resembles serous membrane in so far as it is a thin, transparent substance, having one smooth free surface turned towai'ds certain cavities of the body, and another connect- ed by delicate cellular substance to the sides of these cavities, or to the parts contained in them. But it differs from serous membrane in the fol- lowing circumstances, ist. It possesses little vas- cularity in the healthy state ; no blood-vessels are almost ever seen in it after death, nor can they be made to receive the finest injection ; Its lymphatics are quite incapable of demonstration ;

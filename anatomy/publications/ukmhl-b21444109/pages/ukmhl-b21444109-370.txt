348 GENEllAL ANATOMY. ten Bander,) which appear also in the form of long, firm, fibrous lines extending longitudinally along the upper surface of the beam. Between these bands and the inner margin of the olfacient groove a connection may be traced over the hnee (das Knie,) or anterior end of the beam. Beyond the covered bands the transverse fibres pass directly into the white matter of the hemi- spheres, where they are connected in different modes with different parts. The general direc- tion is that of expansion, like the rods of a fan, or radiation, like the rays of a luminous body. The fibres which compose the knee or anterior end, sinking into the hemisphere near the anterior cor- nu, meet those forming the first and anterior staff of the brain-limb, which lie in the anterior knotty end of the striated body, and wind round the ad- joining edge of the staff-wreath (der Stabkranz.) In the intermediate substance, which is knotty before, and spreads into a brush-shaped expansion behind, the middle rods of the staff-wreath unite with their anterior extremities, and with the fibres of the beam. This forms the first or anterior junction of the beam with the limbs. The middle fibres, passing immediately into the hemisphere, meet more abruptly with those of the limbs. Suddenly contracting, as it were, they coalesce with those of the tcsnia, and are covered by the gray matter of the brush-like termination above-mentioned, and epithelion, which is here very thick. The radiating fibres of both systems

In early life the growth of the osseous system may be suspended or interrupted, so that the parts of the skeleton are incomplete. This deficiency generally takes place on the mesial plane, at the line where the bones of each side are approaching to unite with each other. It is most common in the spinous processes of the vertebrae, in the bones of the head, and those of the upper jaw and pa- late. In the spine it is generally connected with the anormal effusion of fluid from the membranes of the chord, or the chord itself, when it consti- tutes spina bifida or cleft spine. The same defi- ciency I have seen in the frontal and nasal bones; and in hare-lip it is by no means uncommon in those of the palate and superior jaw. 16. Before concluding this chapter, a few words may be said on the morbid states incident to the teeth. The enamel is liable to be worn down by the mutual attrition of the teeth of the upper and lower jaw. This detrition, which has been parti- cularly described by Prochaska, is most conspicu- * Cruveilhier, Anat. Pathol. Vol. i. p. 230.

Piedagnel; \ another by M. Berard in the anterior lobes ;^ and perhaps those given by Dr Hooper, (Plate XI. XII. Fig. 1.) The physical characters of this form of tuber- cular deposit are tolerably uniform. Varying in number from one or two to four, five, or six, and in size from that of a pea to a walnut, they con- sist of opaque white matter, with a tint of pale- yellow, of the consistence of soft cheese, sometimes granular, but always without vessel or trace of organic structure. It is chiefly albuminous, and friable. In general they are surrounded by a vascular cyst of variable thickness. Of the man- ner of their formation little is known Several of the cases of Dr Abercrombie would lead to the idea, that the white albuminous matter of the tubercle is deposited in a fluid or semifluid shape, which afterwards undergoes a slow coagulation. || * Traite Clinique et Pathologique, p. 161.

437 BRAIN. brains of persons in whom chronic encephalo- meningeal congestion caused mental derangement. The brain in fatuous persons appears to have been early observed by Tulpius, Kerkringius, King, and Scheide, to be soft and flaccid. This fact, which was repeated by Morgagni, was afterwards veri- fied by John Ernest Greding of Waldheim, who in 17715 in an elaborate description of the anor- mal changes found in the brains of epileptic ma- niacs, states, that in more than one-half (fifty-one cases) the brain was either universally or very generally, especially its central parts, unusually soft and flaccid; and that though this may not be a uniform cause of deranged intellect, it is a fre- quent accompaniment of the state of the brain on which this depends.* In twelve cases the vault and septum were so soft, that spontaneously or by a slight touch they were reduced to thin pulp. Among thirty-seven cases of this form of cere- bral disorder inspected by Haslam, in seven the substance of the brain was soft, very soft, or doughy with abundance of red points, the usual indications of capillary injection, and effusion of serous fluid, the effect of meningeal injection, f Among the dissections of Dr Marshall not more * Melancholico-Maniacorum et Epilepticorimi in Ptoc- hotropheo Waldheimensi demoi'tuorum sectiones ti'adit Jo- annes Ernesto Greding.

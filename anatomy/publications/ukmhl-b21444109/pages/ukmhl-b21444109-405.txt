383 BRAIN. posed by Morgagni and Lieutaud, to the former of whom it was well known, to be of the nature of gangrene in other parts. This idea, which is also that of Jemina * and of Baillie, has been re- vived by Dr Abercrombie. f Though unwilling to dissent from the opinion of a pathologist dis- tinguished for accurate induction, it appears to me exceedingly doubtful, for the reasons above stated, how far this analogy can be demonstrated. A part of the brain changed as above de- scribed is indeed disorganized, may be said to be dead, and in this sense the change may be termed gangrene of the hrain. But when it is found in different degrees, and in so many dif- ferent morbid states of the brain, some of them of long continuance, it is difficult to be satisfied that every one of them must be viewed equally as gan- grene. In the present work I avoid as much as possible whatever is hypothetical or doubtful. Upon this principle I conceive it improper to offer, on the nature of this change, any further opinion than can be collected from the circumstances above stated of its history anjd connections. * " Aliud etiam ex hoc morbo defuncti caput aperui; et memini inter caetera observata substantias cerebri pulposee portionem magnitudine nucis avellanae, colore, et consisten- tia vitiatam, ita ut esset coloris tane et mollior, non secus ac poma vel pyra cum intus marcescere incipiunt.

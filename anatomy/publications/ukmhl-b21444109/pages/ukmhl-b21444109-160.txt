GENERAL ANATOMY. 138 veying coloured or colourless blood, in which in- spection, microscopic observation, and injections show that arterial branches at once terminate, and minute veins (radiculcB venoses) have their origin. It is clear that, physiologically speaking, these vessels can neither be regarded as arteries nor as veins strictly; for the characters on which this distinction is founded are necessarily lost or obliterated in this system of vessels. There is no precise point at which the arterial tissue or struc- ture can be said to terminate, and none at which the venous structure can be said to commence. Inspection or microscopic observation can afford little or no aid here, for the vessels are too small to allow us to examine their structure correctly. If, however, we adopt the doctrines of Bichat with regard to the inner arterial and venous tunics forming the ultimate tube of small arteries and small veins, we must conclude that the arterial membrane is lost in the venous, and that the com- mon membrane of red blood is identified with the common membrane of dark or modena blood. In this conclusion there is nothing either absurd or improbable, and, though not founded on actual ob- servation, it is greatly more natural than many similar ideas which have been formed on the nature of this system of vessels. It may be added that it is not at variance with what is observed in these vessels in the living body. It is found that the blood in a minute artery is not of the bright red colour which it possesses in the trunk and large

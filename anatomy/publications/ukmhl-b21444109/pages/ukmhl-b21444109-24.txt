4 GENERAL ANATOMY, just idea of the intimate structure and properties of the several animal textures. In general, how- ever, these notices are meagre and scanty. Some- times they are too generalizing, and hastily refer every variety of texture to one or two hypotheti- cal elements ; too often they consist of fanciful conjectures substituted for accurate observation; and they are never so clear and satisfactory as to afford useful instruction to the pathological in- quirer. 1628. Marcello Malpighi, professor of medicine successively in the universities of Bologna, of Pi- sa, and of Messina, and finally invited to Rome as physician to Innocent XII., was the first anato- mist in whose hands the knowledge of intimate structure became a science of accurate obser- I6C0. vation. In this manner he investigated assidu- ously the minute structure of the lungs and the disposition of their vessels; he examined the 1661. omentum, and inquired into the manner in which fat and marrow are secreted ; he studiously en- 1665. deavoured to unfold by dissection and microsco- pical observation the minute structure of the brain; he demonstrated the organization of the skin, and considered its constituents as the organ of touch; he studied the structure of bone, and exposed the his late Majesty of Blessed Memory, and Fellow of the King's most famous College of Physicians in London, and formerly a Fellow of the Royal Foundation of Trinity College, in the most flourishing University of Cambridge.

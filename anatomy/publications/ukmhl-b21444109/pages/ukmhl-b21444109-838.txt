NOTES. 814 stances under which it takes place or does not take place are determined. The fact was early demonstrated by Molin- elli; and much inquiry and experiment was made by Pour- four de Petit, Saucerotte, and others, members of the Acade- my of Surgery ; and has since been the subject of occasional inquiry to several from Morgagni to Dr Anderson and Dr Yellowly. The mutual interlacement of the cerebral chords between the i-estiform bodies has been supposed at various times, from Mistichelli and Pourfour de Petit, adequate to explain it. To this the principal objection is the fact, that palsy of the opposite side, though frequent, is not an inva- riable result of injui'y of the brain. Note L—P. 486. I have elsewhere said that this interruption of normal ac- tion of vessels depends on a sudden change somehow affect- ed in them, in consequence of which they no longer continue the nutritious process. The proof that the imperfect deve- lopement of the arterial system is only a collateral effect, is found in the fact, that the developement of these vessels is al- ways equal and sometimes superior to the progress of the anormal action and its effects. Note M—P. 514.. This subject it was my intention to illustrate with several cases which have come under my own observation. As these, however, are similar to all other cases with which the prac- tical surgeon is familiar, I defer the details of them for the present. Note N P. 569. I have already adverted to the late period at which sur- geons began to have a just idea of the process of necrosis. As a counterpart of this it is worthy of remark, that the no- tions of spma ventosa were so vague and unsettled among the older surgeons, that many instances of disease of bones which belong to the head of necrosis were denominated spina ven- tosa. The whole of the cases which Amyand delineates in the Philosophical Transactions as spina ventosa are really ex-

265 NERVOUS TISSUE, sities, it is distinctly neurilematic. 2c?, The optic nerve is still more peculiar in this respect. The instant it quits the optic commissure, {commissura tractuum,) it begins to be invested by a firm ge- neral neurilema, which sends into the interior substance of the nerve various membranous septa or partitions, forming separate canals, in which the nervous matter is contained. These partitions, however, are so thin, that at first sight the optic nerve seems to consist merely of one exterior mem- branous cylinder inclosing the proper membranous substance. 3r/, Lastly, we may remark, that the auditory nerve, or the soft portion of the seventh pair of most anatomical writers, is the only nerve in which this covering cannot be traced. The neurilema is much thinner and more deli- cate in the nerves which are distributed to the internal organs, as the lungs, heart, stomach, &c. (nerves of the organic life, great sympathetic and pneumogastric nerves, vagum), than in those belonging to the muscular system. The second component part of the nervous chord or filament is the proper nervous matter which occupies the cavity of the neurilematic ca- nals. Little is known concerning the nature or organization of this substance. It is whitish, somewhat soft, and pulpy; but whether it consists of aggregated globules, as was attempted to be established by Delia Torre and Sir Everard Home, or of linear tracts disposed in a situation paral- lel to each other, as appears to be the result of the inquiries of Monro, Reil, and others, or of

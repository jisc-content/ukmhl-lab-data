GENERA I, ANATOMY. 716 recently by Dr M. Hall, * and Dr Thomas Cuming. + In this disease the mucous membrane of the mouth, cheek, or gums, becomes hot, swelled, of a dark-red colour, and even- tually black, hard, and dead. The mortified portion begins then to be thrown off; but in the meantime the original in- flammatory process advances; and combined with that ne- cessary for ejecting the sloughs, is accompanied with extreme pain, and much constitutional disturbance. Though this disorder has been thought to originate in the skin, in which it appears when presented to the practitioner, it may always be traced to the mucous membrane of the mouth ; a fact which is properly verified by the observation of Dr Cuming. J The second variety of this disease is seen in the pudendum of young girls, in whom the labial or vulvular membrane is liable to a species of diffuse inflammation which almost in- variably terminates in mortification of the mucous corion, which is then cast in the form of slough. According to the observations of Mr Kinder Wood, to whom we are indebted for the most distinct account of this disorder yet published, the labial mucous membrane becomes of a dark red colour, swelled, and covered by numerous watery vesicles or aphthce, the cuticle of which dropping off discloses deep foul ulcers, surrounded with much redness, and secreting thin oifensive matter. Similar aphthae also appear on the skin of the mons veneris, perincBum, and adjoining parts. ยง Though the disease is often fatal by the severity of the constitutional disorder, in some instances, after the sloughs are cast, effu- sion of lymph and granulation may take place, and, unless much care is taken in dressing, great part of the vaginal orifice and the labia are united permanently, leaving only a small orifice for the escape of the urine. In this manner the vagina is not unfrequently closed so as to simulate congeni- tal imperforation.

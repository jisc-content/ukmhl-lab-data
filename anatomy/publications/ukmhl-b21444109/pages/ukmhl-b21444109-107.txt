ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. 87 which they have never yet been traced. But in different textures they are found in different de- grees ; and they may vary in extent even in the same texture in two different conditions. The parts which receive the largest and most numerous vascular ramifications are the brain and spinal chord, the glandular organs, the muscles, volunta- ry and involuntary, the mucous membranes, and the skin. In bones, on the contrary, in the fibrous membranes, and their modifications, tendons, and ligaments, and in the serous membranes few arte- ries are seen to penetrate ; and these are general- ly minute, sometimes only colourless capillaries. There are some textures in which arteries cannot be traced, though their properties indicate that they must receive vessels of some kind. Such are cartilage, and the arachnoid membrane. (Ruysch and Haller.) Lastly, arteries are not found in the scarf-skin, in nails, the enamel of the teeth, the hair, nor in the membranes of the umbilical chord. In early life bones are much more vascular than in adult age ; and in the bones of young subjects arteries may be traced going out through the epiphyses into the cartilages, in which they can- not at a later period of life be demonstrated. * Section 11.

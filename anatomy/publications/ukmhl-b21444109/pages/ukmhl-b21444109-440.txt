GENERAL ANATOMY. 418 which alone is epidemic, or rather endemial, the nature of the periodical and epidemic apoplexy is easily understood. These soporose agues may be sporadic or ge- neral ; prevail mostly in the summer or autumnal months in warm countries; and after a few pa- roxysms, sometimes the second or third, are gene- rally fatal. Their mortality is so uniform that they have been named death-fevers (Todten-fieber) in Germany and Hungary, where they used to be very common. They were observed at Rhodes by Praxagoras, the master of Herophilus ; after- wards at London in 1678 by Sydenham; at Rome and in various parts of Italy by Baglivi in 1694 and 1695, and by Lancisi the same year, and at Bagnarea in 1707 ; at Hanover by Werlhof; and by Cleghorn in Minorca. The extravasations into the cavities of the brain, observed by Jackson in yellow fever, belong to the head of meningeal hemori-hage. In continued fevers of this and other countries, apoplectic death is so common, that I need only refer to the works of Stoll, Mills, Bateman, Cheyne, Barker, and Harty. It appears to be at once ce- rebral and meningeal. In purpura and sea-scurvy death not unfre- quently takes place from hemorrhage within the brain, or on its surfaces. The latter is most com- mon, and as such belongs to the head of meningeal hemorrhage. On a form of apoplexy termed nervous much

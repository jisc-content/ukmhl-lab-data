ADIPOSE TISSUE. 61 Glisson, and Morgagni, that it existed in the ar- terial blood, saw no difficulty in the notion of se- cretion, or rather of a process of separation ; and upon much the same grounds the opinion is adopt- ed by Portal and others. Bichat, again, contends, that no fat can be recognized in the arterial blood, and justly adduces the fact, that none can be dis- tinguished in blood drawn from the temporal ar- tery. To the accuracy of this fact I can bear po- sitive testimony, having repeatedly examined, with the view of recognizing the bufFy coat, and detect- ing oily particles, blood which I had drawn from this vessel,â€”the latter invariably without success. This result is not at variance with the fact ob- served by Dr Traill, who found oily matter in venous blood in two instances. In wounds in the human body during life, and in living animals, oily particles may be seen floating on the surface of the blood ; but these proceed from division of the adipose vesicles. That fat does not exist in the arterial blood may be therefore admitted as an established point. The idea that it is separated, or strained from this fluid, therefore, must also be gratuitous ; and as such it is viewed by Bichat, who considers the deposition of fat as the effect of exhalation. This, it must be confessed, is little more than a different name for the process termed by Haller secretion. Lastly, an opinion has been delivered by Mascagni, that, while the arteries deposit or pour forth an imper- fect or crude oily fluid, the lymphatics absorb the thin parts, and leave the residue in a more solid

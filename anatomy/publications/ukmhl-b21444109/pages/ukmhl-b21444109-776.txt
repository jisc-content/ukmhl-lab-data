GENERAL ANATOMY. 752 brane is well known. Its flocculent-vascular, or tomentose surface, is applied closely and imme- diately to every part of the convoluted surface, both eminences and depressions (gyri et sulci) ; to every part of the foliated surface of the cerebellum in like manner; and finally, though in a more de- licate form, to the surface of the spinal chord, transmitting" those vessels which enter and issue from the substance of each part. The continuity of the mater or exterior division of the proper cerebral membrane, with the choroid plexus or interior division, may be demonstrated in the following manner. First, the jjia mater may be traced behind and below the posterior extremity of the mesolobe or middle band, {aa^a riKKosihg, corpus callosum, der bal- ken,) where it is continuous with the transverse web called velum inferpositum, and which may be regarded in this order of examination as the first part of the central division. Secondly, from this point, the situation of the velum interpositum, it may be traced forwards on both sides of the mesial plane into the lateral ventricles, spread over the surface of the optic tJialamus and striated emi- nence in the form of the vascular web called cho- roid plexus, the right half of which communicates with the left by means of a similar slip of vascular membrane lying beneath the vault (fornix), and behind the anterior pillars of that body at the spot termed Foramen Monroianum. Thirdly, it may be traced over the geniculate bodies or posterior

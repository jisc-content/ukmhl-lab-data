BRAIN. 393 In the circumstances now mentioned, purulent collections are the result of primary inflammation, spontaneous or traumatic. I must further repeat explicitly what has been already said, that they take place in a secondary manner in fever. Col- lections of purulent matter within the brain after fever were first distinctly found by Pringle, after- wards by Borsieri and Eisfeld, * and more recent- tly by Jackson and Mills. These are doubtless the eifects of inflammation, which, however, is in this case a secondary and adventitious circum- stance in the progress of the disease. These, nevertheless, and similar phenomena, have been conceived to alford evidence that fever consists in inflammation of the brain. It is un- necessary to examine the origin of this theory; the first traces of which may be found in the writings of Willis, Werlhof, Torti, Donald Monro, and a paper of M. Marteau de GrandviUiers. f Reil ap- pears to have entertained the idea, that cerebral inflammation, though not the cause of the symp- toms, takes place in fever. The first attempt, however, to connect the phenomena of fever with those of inflammation, was made by Ploucquet of * J. F. A.

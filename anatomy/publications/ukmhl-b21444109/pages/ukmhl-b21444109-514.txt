GENERAL ANATOMY. 492 It is peculiar to muscular fibre, and is found in no other living tissue. The influence of the brain and nerves over muscular contraction, and the inquiry of the pro- perties peculiar to muscles, form an interesting subject of investigation, on which many facts have been communicated since the time of Haller and Whytt, and especially within the last ten years by Nysten, Le Gallois, Wilson Philip, Bell, Magen- die, Flourens, Fodera, and Rolando, But it is too extensive to be considered in this place ; and, for information on the subject, I refer to the ordi- nary physiological works, and to those journals in which these researches are detailed. * The muscles have been divided according to the manner in which the phenomena of contraction take place,â€”into 1st, muscles obedient to the will, or voluntary ; 2d, muscles not under the influence of the will, or involuntary; and 3d, muscles of a mixed character, the motions of which are neither entirely dependent or independent of the will. The first order comprehends all the muscles of the skeleton ; the second comprehends the hollow muscles, as the heart, stomach, and intestinal ca- nal ; and the third comprehends such muscular or- gans as the diaphragm, intercostal muscles, blad- der, rectum, &c. * Elementa Physiologiae, Tome iv.

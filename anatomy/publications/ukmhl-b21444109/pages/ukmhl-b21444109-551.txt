529 BONE. or feeding an animal with madder, shows the vascularity of this substance. To have a clearer and more accurate idea of the minute structure of bone, it is requisite to break transversely a long bone, and examine its frac- tured surface by a good glass, or to examine in the same manner the transverse fracture of a long bone which has been burnt white in a charcoal fire. The broken surface presents a multitude of minute holes, generally round or oval, which are larger towards the medullary cavity, but become exceedingly minute towards the outer surface of the bone. Of these minute holes no part of the bone, however compact in appearance, is destitute ; and the only difference is, that they are more mi- nute, and more regularly circular towards the outer than towards the medullary surface. These circular holes are transverse sections of the tuhuli of Lewenhoeck, the longitudinal pores of Havers, (Osteologia, p. 43 and 46,) the pores and tuhuli of Reichel, and the longitudinal canals of Howship. They communicate with each other by means of their great multiplicity and slight obliquity and tortuosity. They contain not blood-vessels exclu- sively, but divisions of the vascular filamentous tissue, which secretes the marrow. They are seen very distinctly in bones which have been burnt. After many careful examinations, I have never been able to observe holes in longitudinal fractures of bones; and I therefore infer that there are no transverse pores. These capillary pores are seen in the flat bones L 1

SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 143 sufficient to consider the influence of the capillary- vessels as an individual or isolated organic system in the production of morbid action. 1. Inflammation. The capillary vessels are be- lieved to be the exclusive seat of the morbid process termed inflammation. No tissue, or no substance rather, destitute of capillaries, is believed suscepti- ble of this process ; and its frequency and violence are justly estimated in proportion to the number of capillaries with which the tissue is supplied. Hair, nail, enamel of the tooth, and cuticle, do not under- go inflammation ; and their morbid states are to be ascribed to disorder of the textures on which their existence and nutrition depend. Filamentous tis- sue, on the other hand, mucous and serous mem- brane, and the substance of such organs as the lung, liver, &c. are very liable to various forms of inflammatory action, which is generally propor- tional to the predominance of red capillaries in the substance of each. Bichat has justly observed that inflammation is very frequent in the cutane- ous, mucous, serous, and filamentous tissues, which injection and microscopic observation show to abound in capillary vessels, but rare in bone, car- tilage, and the fibrous tissues in which there are few capillaries, or where the irritable or inflam- matory susceptibility, (la sensibilite organiqtie,) is more moderate. It is difficult to explain the infrequency of inflammation in muscular tissue without having recourse to this lastproperty, which this author ascribes to the capillary vessels. Its

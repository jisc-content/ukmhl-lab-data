The rete mucosum gives the colour to the skin ; is black in the negro ; white brown or yel- lowish in the European." * Bichat denies the existence of a mucous coating or varnish (corpus mucosum,) such as Malpighi describes it, and regards the vascular surface of the corion as the only mucous net. According to Chaussier, the skin consists of two parts only, the derma (Â§ggjM/a) cutis vera or corion, and the epidermis, cuticle, or scarf-skin; the first embracing the organic elements of this tissue ; the second being an inorganic substance prepared by the organic, and deposited on its surface. This opinion is adopted by Gordon, according to whom the skin consists of two substances placed above each other like layers or plates (lamince), the inner of which is the true skin, the outer the cu- ticle or scarf-skin. Beclard, on the contrary, thinks that a peculiar matter, which occasions the colour by which the several races are distin- guished, is found between the outer surface of the corion and the cuticle ; and that no fair race is des- titute of it except the albino, the peculiar appear- * Experiments on the Insensible Perspiration of the Hu- man Body, showing its affinity to Respiration.

530 GENERAL ANATOMY. of the skull. I find them in the compact mat- ter of the outer and inner tables of the occipital bone when well burnt, in which they seem to pass gradually from the lattice-work of the diploe to the distinct pores of the tables. I doubt, how- ever, whether these pores can be said, as in the long bones, to indicate canals. They seem rather to belong to a very delicate cancellated struc- ture. These pores are most numerous and distinct in the bones of young subjects. In the humerus of a child burnt to whiteness, I find them to be large, numerous, and distinct, even at the periosteal sur- face of the bone. In that of a young man of 28, they are larger, more numerous, and more distinct than in bones of older subjects. In a very dense ulna before me, though distinct through a good glass, they are exceedingly minute, and quite im- perceptible to the naked eye. Though these circular pores are most distinct in calcined bones, and might therefore be thought to be the result of the burning, yet that they are not, I infer from the circumstance that they are seen by a good glass in the transverse fracture of splinters of the femur and other large bones. If a portion of bone be immersed in sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, or acetic acid properly diluted, it becomes soft and pliable, and when dried, is found to be lighter than before; yet it is impossible to discover that any particle of its substance has been mechanically removed, or that its shape and ap- pearance are changed.

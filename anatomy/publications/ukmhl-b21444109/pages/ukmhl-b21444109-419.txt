One of the great uses of the proper or vascular membrane (pia mater) is to sustain and convey, as it were, the minute ar- teries into the substance of the brain. No artery, however minute, enters this organ without pre- viously passing through the pia mater; and if the carotid and vertebral arteries be injected, the ce- rebral matter may be washed away entirely; while all the vessels by which it was traversed are seen issuing from the attached surface and numerous processes of this membrane. The vessels thus demonstrated consist of minute arteries and veins, through which, in the sound or normal state, the blood moves uniformly and easily, without under- going any permanent retardation. Dissection, however, shows, that from various causes, either the whole of these vessels, or a certain cluster or set of them, may become inordinately distended with blood; while others, which, in consequence of conveying colourless fluid previously; eluded ob- servation, now becoming injected with red blood, are rendered visible. The existence of this state is proved by cutting into thin slices the brains of persons cut off in this condition, when numerous blood-drops follow each incision, and each part is

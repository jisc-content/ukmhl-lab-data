GENERAL ANATOMY. 576 Though Still frequent in these islands, it is not peculiar to them ; and it is by no means unknown in other countries of Europe. Notwithstanding the fact above-mentioned, the disease is not to be regarded as new. Its occurrence in infancy only was the cause of its escaping observation. Its in- fluence, however, in leaving more or less defor- mity of the skeleton mvist have at all times at- tracted notice. Deformed dwarfs have been known in all ages. The gibbi, the vari, and the valgi of the Romans must have been more or less rachitic in infancy. From this cause the deformity of Thersites might have originated. It is also to be remarked, that Fabricius Hildanus delineates the serpentine lateral curvature of the spine in a girl of 8, whose bones were soft as wax, * which could be produced by no other cause save rickety softness. When the disease first attracted notice, and the chemical constitution of bone was understood, it was believed that rickets consisted merely in the late deposition of phosphate of lime. Of this theory the defect is its simplicity. Though the earthy matter is doubtless very deficient, this is not the sole change in the rachitic skeleton. The bone is light, spongy, and cellular. The close or compact structure is said to disappear. The truth is, that it is not yet formed. The interior of the bone is homogeneous like that of a foetal bone, without distinct medullary cavity, without cancel- lated structure, and without compact bone; but * Cent. 6, Obs. 75.

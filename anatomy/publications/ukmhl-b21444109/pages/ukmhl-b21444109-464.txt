GENERAL ANATOMY. 442 fatuity; (dementia.) The cerebral arteries are generally found opaque, and affected with stea- tomatous deposition. (Marshall.) From slight induration of a great part or the whole of the cerebral mass, to inconsiderable indu- ration of particular regions, the transition is easy. According to the researches of M. Pinel the younger, who has examined the subject with par- ticular attention, in the change from sound brain of natural consistence to that of final, compact, and apparently inorganic induration, two distinct stages may be recognized. a. From the observations of MM. Foville and Pinel-Grand-Champ, it results that in cer- tain persons the exterior or peripheral part of the brain is liable to a state of capillary in- jection or chronic inflammation; in other words, that the meningeal and encephalo-meningeal ca- pillaries may become the seat of a process of in- jection partly chronic, partly intermittent, or va- riable, according to the state of the vascular sys- tem in general, and the operation of various excit- ing causes. One of the effects of this encephalo- meningeal injection is to tinge of a red colour more or less deep, the gray matter of the convo- luted surface; and while the injection produces more or less mental derangement, this red tint is connected almost invariably with furious and ma- niacal paroxysms. When it proceeds to fatuity albuminous deposits take place on the surface, or on the membranes of the brain; and the gray

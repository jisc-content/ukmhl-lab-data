GENERAL ANATOMY. 506 is an example. Tendinous texture readily sloughs under inflammation, either spontaneous or from injury. In whitloe the tendons of the flexor mus- cles of the fingers are often killed and thrown off by ulceration; and when tendons are injured by burns or gunshot wounds death of their texture is almost invariable. In this state tendon loses its silvery white appearance and lustre, assumes a dull leaden gray aspect, and becom.es thick and doughy. The process of inflammation is most distinctly seen in wounds of the extremities, and in lacera- tions or ruptures of the tendons. They become enlarged, sometimes expanded, in various affec- tions of the joints. Punctured or lacerated wounds of tendinous structure are sometimes succeeded by tetanic motions, which terminate fatally. Ossifi- cation, so common in the tendons of birds, is al- most unknown in the human subject; unless the sesamoid bones be admitted as examples of this transformation. CHAPTER XVI. Section I.

Against the formation of this order of tissues fewer objections can be urged, though ligament and periosteum undoubtedly furnish its most per- fect examples ; and it may be doubted whether fascia ought to be referred to it, or arranged with

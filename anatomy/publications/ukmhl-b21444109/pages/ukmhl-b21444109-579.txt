Inspection shows that the bones are penetrated by bloody extravasation, —that the vessels are relaxed and atonized,—and that nutritious deposition is suspended. This scor- butic diduction, which depends on a disease affect- ing the whole system, may be removed by the same means which remove that morbid condition. Too often, however, it takes place in that stage of the disease in which recovery is impossible. 3. I have above stated that it may be justly ques- tioned whether bone itself undergoes the organic process of inflammation. Most of the facts hither- to collected, when well investigated, favour the inference, that the inflammatory conditions of bone are to be referred to inflammation taking place either in the periosteum; or the tomentose medulla- ry web; or, finally, in the articular synovial mem- brane or cartilage ; and most of the morbid states observed by authors in bone may be traced to some variety or degree of inflammation in one or more of these textures. a. When the periosteum becomes inflamed, one of several effects may follow. a. It may induce effusion of coagulable lymph into its substance, or between that and the bone, —constituting simple node, and the tumour termed gumma. (Bromfield, p. 14.) (3. By a modification of this action it may ef- fuse lymph, which afterwards becomes ossified,— constituting the ossific node of Hunter and How-

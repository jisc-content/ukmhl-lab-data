ADIPOSE TISSUE. 67 that this should be uniform. We want, in short, correct facts on the point at issue. 5. Adipose Sarcoma. This consists in an unusu- al deposition of firm fatty matter in cells, the com- ponent fibres of which are suflficiently firm to give it consistence. The tumour, which is generally globular, is always surrounded by a thin capsule formed by the condensation of the contiguous fi- lamentous tissue. The tumour is supplied by a few blood-vessels, which proceed from the capsule, but which form so slender an attachment that they are readily broken, and the tumour is easily scooped from its seat. This sort of tumour occurs almost invariably in the adipose membrane, and seems to consist in a local hypertrophy of the part in which it is found. It may have a broad basis, but is often pendulous, or attached by a narrow neck or stalk. It is the most common form of sarco- matous tumour, and may occur in any part of the body in which there is adipose membrane, but is chiefly found on the front and back of the trunk, and not unfrequently on two places at the same time. 6. Steatoma. In adipose sarcoma the adipose matter is deposited in cells, and the tumour derives a degree of firmness from the fibres with which it is thus traversed in every direction. In other in- stances, however, the adipose matter is deposited in a mass in the cavity of a spherical or spheroidal cyst, formed in the filamentous or the adipose tis- sue ; and the tumour is soft and compressible, and

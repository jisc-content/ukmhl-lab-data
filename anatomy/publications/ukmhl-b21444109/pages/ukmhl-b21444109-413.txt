391 BRAIN. between the receipt of the injury and the fatal termination. * In one by Dr Denmark, the in- terval between the supposed injury and the pe- riod of death was twelve months, t Many simi- lar cases are found in the writings of surgeons. ^ The result is, that a portion of brain more or less extensive is converted into purulent matter, con- tained in general in a membranous cyst, more or less thick and vascular, according to the inter- val between the infliction of the injury and the time of examination. Between suppuration of the brain, from inter- nal and external causes, a distinction has been drawn by Baillie, in the circumstance, that in the former it is generally in the substance, and in the latter on the surface of the organ. This dis- tinction does not hold good in several respects, and requires modification. 1*^, Where a long in- terval elapses after the infliction of the injury, the collection of purulent matter is almost in- variably deep-seated. 2c?, In like manner, when the injury operates in the manner of counter- stroke, the collection is also often within the sub- stance of the organ.

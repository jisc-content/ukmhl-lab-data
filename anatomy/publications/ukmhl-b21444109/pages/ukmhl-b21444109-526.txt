GENERAL ANATOMY. 504 miliar to all. Almost cylindrical in shape, but flattened at the muscular end, and tapering where inserted, a tendon consists of numerous white lines as minute as hairs, of satin-like glistening appearance, placed parallel and close to each other. A tendon is easily divided, and torn into longitu- dinal or parallel portions, and by the forceps very minute fibres may be detached and removed with ease, its whole length. These facts show the great tenacity of this tissue, and the regular pa- rallelism with which the component fibres are united. The last circumstance distinguishes them completely from ligaments and periosteum, in which the fibres cross in all directions, and in con- sequence of which these tissues cannot be so easily split or separated. These fibres are united by fila- mentous tissue. Tendon is softened and more easily separable by maceration in water or alkaline fluids; it is crisped by acid fluids, and rendered translucent by immersion in oil of turpentine. It has not been injected, but it is presumed tohave blood-vessels and absorbents. No nerves have been traced into it. Tendon when boiled becomes soft and large, as- sumes the appearance of a transparent gelatinous substance; and finally, if the boiling be continued, is dissolved and converted into gelatine. This fact, which is well known to cooks, who prepare jellies from tendinous parts of young animals, shows that tendon consists principally of gelatine, disposed in an organized form.

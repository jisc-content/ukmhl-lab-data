These two kinds of bodies differ from each other, Isf, in the situation which they respectively occupy; 2(1, in the kind of envelope with which they are in- vested ; 3c?, in the mode in which the nervous fi- laments pass through them and from them. By Wutzer, who considers the ganglion of Gasserius, the ciliary and the maxillary of Meckel, as cere- bral ganglions, they are divided into three sets, those of the cerebral system, the spinal system, and the vegetative, or those connected with the organs of involuntary motion. * Void of the dense strong coat with which the others are invested, the cerebral ganglions consist of soft secondary matter, connected to the fila- ments of one, or at most two branches, and are arranged with less complexity. (Wutzer.) The spinal ganglions are said to possess two coverings, one of which resembles the hard cere- bral membrane, f meninx dura,) the other the soft cerebral membrane, fme?iinx tenuis, pia mater.) The non-spinal, or compound ganglions, have also two coverings, which are merely different modifi- cations of filamentous tissue less dense and com- pact than in the former. Both these sets of ganglions being by maceration stripped of their tunics, and deprived of the soft pulpy cellular matter, are resolved into an innumerable series of nervous threads, most of which are minute and * De Corporis Hurxiani Gangliorum Fabrica, &c. cap. i. ii. ยง 41, p. 52.

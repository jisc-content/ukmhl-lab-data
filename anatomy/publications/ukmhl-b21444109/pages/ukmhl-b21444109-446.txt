In the work of Dr Abercrombie are given cases in which the diseased spot was nearer the surface of the organ; (111, 116, 117, 118.) 1 met with one instance in which hemiplegia was connected with pulpy disorganization of the posterior part of the hemisphere, so near the convoluted surface that the lesion could be immediately recognized after removing the duia mater, by the unusual change of colour and consistence. Dr Duncan Junior records two excellent examples in which pulpy destruction of the anterior and middle lobes of the brain caused hemiplegy, and that of the cerebeUum gave rise to palsy of the paraplegic form, without disorder of intellect. * It appears also from the testimony of Dr Cheyne, that the form of disease which he terms creeping palsy depends on the progressive softening of the sub- stance of the hemispheres. In the only case of this recorded by the author, the morbid change was vascular injection, and pulpy destruction of the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, which was of the consistence of thick cream, f The circumstances of cases in which this change * Contributions to Morbid Anatomy, No. II.

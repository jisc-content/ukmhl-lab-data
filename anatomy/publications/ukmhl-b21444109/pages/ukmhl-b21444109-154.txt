t 132 GENERAL ANATOMY. time it becomes so tortuous, that this may be re- ceived as one of the physical characters of varicose veins. We possess no very precise facts on the exact change which takes place in the venous tunics, whether it be mei'e dilatation or injury of some kind, and rupture of the proper venous coats. By Meckel it is regarded as simple dilatation with- out injury of texture. When one part of a vein is dilated into a distinct sac, I believe the inner coat is generally rent. In some cases of varix one or more valves are lacerated, or detached from the inner membrane. In others varix has followed a rent or lacerated wound of the outer venous tunic. Varix occurs especially in the veins of the lower extremities, for instance in the trunk or branches of the saphena. It is common in those of the spermatic chord, in which it is distinguished by the name of varico-cele, and not unfrequent in the veins of the rectum, where it causes one va- riety of hemorrhoidal tumours. In the upper ex- tremities it is rare, one case only by Petit being recorded, I have seen, nevertheless, a varicose tumour of the posterior ulnar vein on the back of the hand, which disappeared under the use of pressure, continued for six or seven months. Of the internal veins the vena a%ygos and sub- clavian have been found varicose. (Morgagni, Por- tal, Baillie.) When a cluster of subcutaneous veins becomes varicose, they generally give rise to much pain, swelling and redness of the skin, and

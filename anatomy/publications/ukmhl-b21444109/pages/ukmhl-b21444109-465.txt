In general the disease is then of shorter duration, and terminates sooner either in convalescence or in death. A more chronic form, however, is connected with this en- cephalo-meningeal congestion, the duration of which may vaiy from twelve or fifteen months to as many years. At the termination of these pe- riods the cerebral substance is compact, remark- ably white, appears void of blood-vessels and ca- pillaries, is diminished in volume, no longer falls under the fingers, but is torn with difficulty, and recoils with elasticity when stretched. It assumes a horny hardness under the action of fire or ni- trous acid. These circumstances show that it contains altered albuminous matter.

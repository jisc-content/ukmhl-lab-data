That this change in the consistence of the brain is the result of a slow oi'ganic process succeeding to inflammation, M. Pinel infers from the symptoms during life, from the collateral effects after death, and from the state of the me- ningeal and cerebral vessels which is known to pre- cede the change. That this is not remote from the truth many circumstances tend to show, I have above mentioned the relation between he- morrhagic injection of the brain and induration, as noticed by M. Serres and Bouillaud. A proof still more unequivocal is found in the fact, that inflammation, both in the membranes and in the cerebi'al substance, is known to be followed by induration of the latter. Thus Abraham Kaawe Boerhaave mentions the case of a soldier cut off by an epileptic attack, in the head of whom, be- sides firm adhesion of the dura mater to the inner table and the jiia mater, with tubercular deposi- tion, the subjacent convoluted gray substance was hard and scirrhous in various places. * The cheese-like induration recorded by Lallemand in the thirtieth case of his second letter is adduced else- where.

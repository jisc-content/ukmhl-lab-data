The instances in the lower ex- tremity are doubtless most common in tropical countries. Though it has been the general practice since the time of Hendy to regard this disease as re- sulting from obstruction of the lymphatic vessels and glands, the phenomena of its formation and progress, with those of its morbid anatomy, show clearly, I think, that the inordinate enlargement arises from a quantity of albuminous or sero-albu- minous fluid, being effused from the exhalants into the cellular tissue of the limb, and which is not removed by adequate absorption. That the en- largement is effected in this manner, and that the effusion is the result of some form of the process of inflammation recurring periodically, may be in- ferred from the following considerations :â€” 1st, In all the cases of the disease which have been accurately observed, the first attack of en- largement is preceded by general inflammatory ac- tion affecting the whole limb, described as similar to rose (erysipelas,) and distinguished by heat, pain, general swelling, and more or less redness. Of these symptoms the effusion and enlargement are a sort of natural crisis. 2d, In most, if not all the cases, this inflamma- tory attack recurs after certain intervals, which * Dublin Hospital ReportSj Vol. IV.

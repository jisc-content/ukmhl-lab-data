BRAIN. 365 only trace of its previous existence is a longitudi- nal depression on the anterior part of the chord. In the young of the human subject it has been found after birth by Charles Stephen, by Co- lumbo, Piccolhomini, Bauhin, Malpighi, Lyser, GoUes, Morgagni, Haller, and Portal. No doubt can be entertained, however, that in such cases it was part of the foetal structure continued to an unusual period by the slow progress of growth, or in consequence of some interruption to the usual process of developement. The chord, in short, is formed in two portions; and when these are in- complete, the longitudinal cavity exists between them. As by progressive enlargement they mu- tually approximate on the mesial plane, this canal necessarily diminishes until it entirely disappears. I am now to consider shortly the minute ana- tomical structure of cerebral matter in the several parts of the organ. The three divisions of brain, small brain, and vertebral prolongation, and their constituent parts, do not present every where the same aspect or obvious qualities, but appear to consist of substances which are distinguished chiefly by their colour. The outer convoluted part of the first division {cerebrum) consists of peculiar substance of a gray or ashen colour. Its convolvited surface, which is covered by the adherent surface of the soft or vas- cular membrane {meninx tenuis, pia mater^ is smooth and uniformly gray, without spots or streaks. At various situations it presents minute

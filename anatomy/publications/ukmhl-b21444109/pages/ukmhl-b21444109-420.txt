GENERAL ANATOMY. 398 penetrated by a much greater number of vessels than natural. * The exquisite or most perfect de- gree of this state is when the blood-drops enlarge immediately after incision,â€”a circumstance from which a very inordinate quantity of fluid blood in the cerebral vessels is indicated, f This state of the cerebral vessels is similar to that of inflammation. The patient is highly sen- sible to transitions of heat and cold ; the skin is hot and dry ; the tongue foul; the stomach dis- ordered, and the urine high-coloured and sedimen- tous. The pulse is full and strong, sometimes hard, but not frequent. The local complaints are dull pain and weight of the head, occasional gid- diness, indistinctness of vision, or dazzling of the eyes, and more or less abolition of memory. When blood is drawn, I have found it present a thick, tough, buffy coat; an observation in which I find I am anticipated by Stoll | and Sir Gilbert Blane. When the above phenomena have continued for a few hours, sometimes a day or two, according to circumstances, the individual falls down destitute of sense and motion, and continues so for a short time. After a little, recollection gradually re- turns, and with it sensation and the power of moving the limbs, though not with such freedom as before. A sense of tingling and numbness may remain in an arm or leg for some time. * Morgagni passinij especially iii. and iv. + Morgagni epist. x. J 7 and 18. + Ratio Med. Pars V. p. 31. Viennae, 1789-

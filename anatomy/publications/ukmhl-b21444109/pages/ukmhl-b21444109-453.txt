431 BRAIN. In like manner, in a case communicated by Ro- yer-Collard to Ollivier, (Obs. 47, p. 334,) pulpy destruction of the anterior part of the chord, from the restiform and olivary eminences, down to the lumbar portion, without affection of the posterior, caused palsy of the trunk and lower ex- tremities without impairing sensation. MalaJeencephalon. Diminished consistence of the brain. The change above described in the consistence of the brain is always accompanied with more or less destruction of its texture. Un- der certain circumstances, nevertheless, its con- sistence may be diminished without change of texture. The natural consistence of the recent adult brain, though well known, it is difficult to de- scribe in exact terms. In general it possesses a degree of toughness which prevents it from being easily divided, unless by a very keen instrument; and after incision minute fragments are left on the sides or edge of the knife. A very thin slice of white cerebral matter is sufficiently tenacious and consistent to sustain its own weight, and to admit of considerable stretching without being broken or lacerated. If put into pure water it continues unchanged for at least eight, ten, or sometimes twelve hours, and without any portion of it being either dissolved, or rendering the wa- ter in any degree turbid. A newly cut surface of brain communicates to the finger a peculiar clam- my or viscid sensation, in consequence of which

GENERAL ANATOMY. 384 The effects of this disease on the system are not very well distinguished. They may be divided into common and proper. The common effects are dull pain, or sense of weight in the head, dull- ness, impaired memory, frequent drowsiness, and occasional peevishness at trifles, and paralytic af- fections of the face, head, and members. The proper effects are sense of formication, numbness, and rigidity, or occasional involuntary contrac- tions of the muscles of the upper extremities, fol- lowed by delirium or fatuity, and a peculiar odour about the head, not dissimilar to that of the mouse. In the spinal chord it gives rise to numb- ness and rigid contraction of the muscles of the lower extremities, and eventually palsy more or less complete. These symptoms, which are chiefly those given by the French authors already mentioned, apply to the acute form of the disease. In more chro- nic states it seems not to affect the muscular mo- tions considerably, but rather to induce fatuity, and other forms of impaired intellect. This in- ference at least results from some of the observa- tions of Morgagni, * and those of Dr John Hun- ter, f This is the state of brain which takes place in cases of fatuity succeeding coup-de-soleil. 3.

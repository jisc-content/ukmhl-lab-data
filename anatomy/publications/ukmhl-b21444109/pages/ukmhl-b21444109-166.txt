144 GENERAL ANATOMY. sensibility to the operation of a stimulus is great. Its susceptibility of inflammatory action is very small. The change which takes place in the capillary vessels in the state of inflammation has given rise to much speculation, research, and experiment. But it may be doubted whether the questions which have been agitated on this subject can yet be regarded as decided. On one point only is there any thing like agreement in the various opinions delivered. It appears to be now the ge- neral belief, that during the process of inflamma- tion the capillary vessels of the part are dilated, and contain more blood than in the healthy state. (CuUen, Hunter, Vacca, and many other authors.) On the cause of this dilatation, however, the senti- ments of pathologists are as much at variance as ever ; and not only are the results of experiments made to determine the circumstances on which this distended state of the capillaries depends, variable and sometimes contradictory, but the conclusions to which they have led are very opposite. One opi- nion is, that the dilatation depends on increased action ; according to the other, it is the effect of a weakened state of the capillaries. The first of these doctrines, which in some form or other has been adopted from Staiil, and De Gorter, by Dr Cullen, appears to have been sug- gested by the increased number of the arterial pulse in a given space, the hardness and tension of its beat, the throbbing of inflamed parts, and 4

SYSTEM OF CAPIl.LARY VESSELS, &C. l6l with the single exception of pulmonary tubercles, in every one of the instances which he has addu- ced the formation of fluid matter, is invariably pre- ceded by inflammation, that is, by morbid enlarge- ment of the capillaries of the affected texture. In the case of lymphatic glands suppurating, these bodies invariably enlarge previously, and are always the seat of dull heavy pain. This enlarge- ment depends either on the vessels undergoing a slow process of dilatation and distension, or on the formation of tubercles in the substance of the gland. The affections of the knee-joint, hip-joint, and other articulations, have been satisfactorily traced to inflammation either of the synovial apparatus, or of the cartilages, or of both, passing on the one tiand to the capsule, and on the other to the bones. During life they are painful, generally swelled or enlarged, and invariably hotter than natural. Dis- section shows these parts to be more or less, some- times highly, vascular. jf many joints, viz. those scrofulous suppurations in the oints of the foot and hand, in the knee, called white swell- ngs ; in the joint of the thigh, commonly called hip-cases ; n the loins, called lumbar abscesses; the discharge of the ibove-mentioned tubercles in the lungs, as well as in many )ther parts of the body, are all matter formed without any jrevious visible inflammation, and are therefore in this one •espect all very similar to one another. They come on in- lensibly, the first symptom being commonly the swellings, n consequence of the thickening, which is not the case with nflammation ; for there the sensation is the first symptom." —Treatise, Chap. iv.

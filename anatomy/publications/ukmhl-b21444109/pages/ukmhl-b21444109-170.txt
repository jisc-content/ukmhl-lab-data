148 GENERAL AXATOMi- means the natural velocity with which the blood moves through any set of capillaries be diminish- ed, and continue so, the quantity of blood in these vessels must be gradually and steadily increased, until it becomes very considerable. This appears to be one cause of the accumulation of blood in any part which is in the state of inflammation. 2. Temporary dilatation of the capillaries not inflammatory. The capillary vessels undergo a tem- porary dilatation during the progress of aneurism, whether allowed to go on naturally, or after the ap- plication of the ligature to the arterial trunk. When the collateral circulation has been fully established by the enlargement of the anastomosing branches, the capillary system shrinks to its ordinary size. 3. Extravasation. When the capillary vessels of any part have been injui-ed, so as to bui'st or give way, the blood which they contained is effused round them, and into the cellular or other struc- ture of the part, occasioning sometimes considera- ble swelling, and, if near the surface, a red, blue, or yellowish colour. In such cii'cumstances the blood is said to be extraiasated, and the change of colour is termed ecchymosis. 4. Mode of repair; union hy adhesion andgra- nidation. When they are divided by simple incision they pour out first blood, then serous or colourless fluids, lastly, a semifluid, which undergoes coagu- lation, and which forms the uniting medium of the divided surfaces. This is the radical moisture of the older physiologists ; (Taliacotius, Ambrose

MUSCULAR TISSUE. 491 various proportions of these principles have been stated in numbers by chemists, there can be no doubt that in the present condition of animal che- mistry it is impossible to place any reliance on them. It is also to be remembered, that the rela- tive proportion of the proximate principles varies at different periods of life. In early life the mus- cular fibre contains a large proportion of gelatine, and very little albumen, fibrin, or osmazome. In adult age, however, the gelatine is very scanty, and the fibrin is abundant. The albumen and gelatine found in muscle seem to be derived chiefly from the filamentous tissue and the aponeurotic intersections. During life the muscular fibre possesses the pro- perty of shortening itself or contracting under cer- tain conditions. These may be referred to the following heads. 1*^, The will in the voluntary muscles, ^d, Proper fluids in the involuntary muscles, as the blood to the heart, articles of food or drink in the stomach, chyme in the small intes- tines, excrement in the large intestines, urine in the bladder, &c. 2d, Mechanical irritants in all muscles. Mh, Chemical irritants; and, 5th, Mor- bid products generated in the course of disease. This property of contracting has received vari- ous names ; contractility {vis contractiUs of L. Bellini), irritability (Glisson), {vis vitalis of De Gorter and Gaubius), excitability, mobility, vis insita, vis propria of Haller, and the organic con- tracility of Bichat.

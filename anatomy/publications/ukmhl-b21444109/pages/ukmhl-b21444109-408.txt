The abscess consisting of a firm cyst, containing purulent matter, is generally found in the centre of the hemispheres. (Powell, case 8; Hooper, PI. 9, Fig. 3; Abercrombie, cases 16, 17.) Collections of purulent matter have been found in the lobes of the cerebellum by Bianchi,* Janus Plancus, f StoU,:[: Weikard, ยง and Abercrombie. || In general they are contained in a cyst more or less distinct, the walls of which are membranous and vascular.

Suppuration, less distinctly defined, and deposited generally in small irregular cavities, takes place in the medulla ob- longata, especially in that part of the olivary body which contains the corpus dentatum.

In his Treatise on the Membranes he confined himself to the examination of the structure and properties of the mucous, serous, and fibi'ous membranes, and a short view of the fibro- mucous and fibro-serous tissues. In his General Anatomy, which appeared in 1801, he delineated the first, and perhaps the most perfect arrange- ment of the different organic textures of the hu- man body that has yet appeared. This author considers the human body as an as- semblage of many different organs, each of which consists of a greater or smaller number of animal substances, which, though thus combined in the formation, or entering into the composition of the same part or organ, are very different in structure and properties from each other Each of these dis- tinct forms of animal matter he calls a tissue or texture, (textus, tela;) and he refers the whole of those which anatomists have enumerated, or which accurate discrimination can distinguish in the human body, to twenty-one general heads.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 804 3d, Very delicate fibres, like those of cellular sub- stance, or like the finest filaments of tendon, are distinctly seen in it after slight maceration ; 4///, It is considerably less strong than serous mem- brane. On these grounds, therefore, synovial mem- brane is to be anatomically distinguished from se- rous membrane. The synovial membrane, as described above, is found not only in each of the moveable articula- tions, but in those sheaths in which tendons are lodged, and in which they undergo a considerable extent of motion, and in certain situations in the subcutaneous filamentous tissue. The distribution of the synovial membranes is much the same in all these situations. They are known to line the ligamentous apparatus of each joint, capsular and funicular ; and they are also continued over the cartilaginous extremities of the bones of which the articulation consists. This continuation, which was originally maintained by Nesbitt, Bonn, and William Hunter, and was de- monstrated by various facts by Bichat, has been lately questioned by Gordon and Magendie, the former of whom especially thinks it unsusceptible of anatomical proof. The cartilaginous synovial membrane is certainly not so easily demonstrable as the capsular, for the same reason which I have already assigned regarding the difficulty of isolat- ing the arachnoid of the dura mater, the capsular pericardium, the ovarian peritonaeum, and the se- rous covering of the tunica olhuginea^'^ihQ want of filamentous tissue.

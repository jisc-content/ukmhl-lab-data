480 GENERAL ANATOMY. A tumour of similar characters is described by Dr Monro Tertius,* the present Professor of Ana- tomy, under his sixth head. In a young man who had suffered from headach, impaired vision, and nausea, followed by epilepsy terminating fatally in a few hours, in the middle lobe of the right hemisphere was a body the size of an orange, somewhat soft, but elastic, and of the colour and consistence of clotted blood. The surrounding brain was in a state of pulpy destruction. These two last cases are regarded as similar to the tumour named hsematoid fungus. I am not prepared to prove that they do not belong to this head ; but their general resemblance in anatomi- cal characters to that described by Rochoux, in- duces me to refer them to the head of Hcematoma. To the same head may be referred that de- scribed by Dr George Gregory,! who, in a man la- bouring under headach, irritable stomach, and epi- leptic fits, and finally destroyed by epilepsy, found within a cyst in the anterior cornu of the left ven- tricle, before the striated nucleus, a body as large as a nutmeg, hard and fleshy, laminated interiorly an inch thick like coagulated blood, with a cavity in the centre. d.

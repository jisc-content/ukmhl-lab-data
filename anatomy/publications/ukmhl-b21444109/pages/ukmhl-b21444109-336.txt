GENERAL ANATOMY. 314 purse-shaped notch, but, after a sigmoid turn to- wards the laminar pyramid, * is insensibly lost among a cluster of transverse plates, which I shall have occasion to notice afterwards. Immediately anterior to this is found the slen- der lobe, {il loho sottile, Malacarne; Der zarte Lappen, Reil;) which is not above three lines broad, and being contained between two concen- tric furrows, is not unlike the segment intercepted by the truncated arcs of two small circles of a sphere. The space of the hemispheric surface within the slender lobe, or between this and the peduncle or arm, is inclosed by three circular lines, two of which, the exterior and interior, correspond to so many furrows ; while the third, which is ante- rior, is formed by the horizontal or marginal fur- row. The space thus inclosed is similar to a spherical triangle, and is occupied by a group of plates which Malacarne denominates the hiventral lobe, (der Zwey-bauchige Lappen, Reil.) Its con- tiguity with the cerebral end of the pneumogastric nerve led Vicq-D'Azyr to give it the name of the lobule of the eighth pair, {lobule du nerf vague) ; and its situation at the posterior corner of the pe- duncle, and under that body, is the reason why it was called sub-peduncular lobule by Dr Gordon. Of these plates the arrangement is peculiar, since they are neither so exactly concentric as in the * Encefalotomia, &c., Articolo i. No. 20, ed Articolo ix. No. 77. See p. 318.

30 GENERAL ANATOMY. plained by Portal and Bichat. The principal points worthy of attention may be stated in the following manner. The filamentous tissue of the head and face communicate freely with each other, and with that of the brain by the cranial openings, and with the submucous tissue of the eyelids, nostrils, lips, and the inner surface of the mouth and cheeks. It communicates also with the subcu- taneous tissue of the neck all round ; and at the angle of the jaw in the vicinity of the parotid gland is the common point of re-union. To this anatomical fact is referred the frequency of swel- lings and purulent collections in the region of the parotid in the course of various diseases of the head, face, and neck. The filamentous tissue of the neck may be viewed as the connecting medium between that of the head and trunk. From the former region it may be traced downwards along the back, loins, breast, sides, flanks, and belly. At the cervical region, and between the shoulders, it is dense and abundant; and, surrounding the dorsal part of the vertebral column it is connected with the me- diastinal tissue, the submucous tissue of the lungs, and the subserous tissue of the costal pleura. At the fore part of the neck it is in like manner con- nected with the abundant tissue of the pectoral region, and by means of that surrounding the larynx and trachea, 1st, with the submucous tissue of the bronchi; and, 2d, with the anterior

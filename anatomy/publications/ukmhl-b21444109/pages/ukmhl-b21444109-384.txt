GENERAL ANATOMY. 362 each twig is attached a number of leaves. (FoUcb; Blattchen.) Of these plates or leaves the structure is uni- formly the same,—white matter internally, cover- ed with a thicker layer of gray. Whether the white is really fibrous or not, as Reil describes, is not easy to say, in consequence of its extreme tenu- ity and small quantity. It is certainly fibrous in the stems and branches, in which the linear ap- pearance can be seen almost by the eye, and al- ways by a glass. I cannot say that it is so evi- dent in the twigs, in which it is in very small quantity ; and in the leaves the intimate disposi- tion is still more difficult to recognize. In the gray matter it is impossible to trace any thing like the fibrous structure. The ramification (die verzweigung, die zeraste- lung,) in the cerebellic hemispheres is connected with the circular-transverse fibres of the protu- berance and the restifom processes exclusively. Some would say that from this, this ramification is derived,—the precise meaning of which I have already endeavoured to determine. In the middle of this organ, however, or on its mesial plane, is found a ramification which appears to be connect- ed with a different source. This is the structure of the upper and lower worm. Between the lower of the quadrigeminous eminences and the cerebel- lum is a thick semicylindrical band on each side, known under the name of 'pillars of the valve, and processus a cerebello ad testes. These a lit-

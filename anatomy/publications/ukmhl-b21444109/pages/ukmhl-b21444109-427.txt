BRAIN. 405 es of complete recovery this is gradually convert- ed, by a slow process of adhesive inflammation, into a membranous substance, harder than the surrounding brain, which, however, is generally softer than sound cerebral matter. (Lerminier, cases 1, 2.) In this manner are formed the ca- vernous sacs described by Wepfer and Morgagni, (Epist. iii. 7, 8, 9, Ix. 21, 6,) and the cavities de- scribed by Baillie, (450, 455,) Wilson, Aberne- thy, *' and others. The contiguous enclosing cerebral matter al- so undergoes peculiar changes, which vary with the interval between extravasation and death. The portion in immediate contact with the clot is generally dark red, wine-lee colour, or, at later periods, of a chocolate brown, and rather pulpy. The portion exterior to this is paler, and of an orange colour, but generally much penetrated by distended vessels. Exterior to this again may be in general distinguished a layer of bluish-white or bluish-yellow matter, gradually terminating in sound brain, but all more or less traversed by blood-vessels. In other cases, in Avhich a longer period elapses between extravasation and death, the portion of brain enclosing the clot is pulpy, of a dun-red or orange-colour, passing to yellow, and terminating gradually in brain of natural colour and consistence. In both cases minute shreds of cerebral matter and filamentous threads may be â€¢ Surgical Works, Vol. II. On Injuries of the Head, pp. 18, 19, and 20. London, 1811.

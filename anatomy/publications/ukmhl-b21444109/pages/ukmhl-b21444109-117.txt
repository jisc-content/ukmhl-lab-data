97 ARTERY, ARTERIAL TISSUE. They occur in various forms ; but two may be par- ticularly mentioned. In the first, small irregular patches of yellow- ish or fawn-coloured matter like wax appear on the inner surface of the proper coat. As the pro- cess of deposition advances, these become thicker and broader. They coalesce, and sensibly raise the outer filamentous coat; while, by their promi- nence interiorly, they diminish the capacity of the arterial tube. At the same time the inner mem- brane becomes irregular, opaque, and shrivelled ; and the connection with the proper tunic being destroyed, it is detached with great facility. * This deposition constitutes the steatomatous degeneration of Professor Scarpa and other au- thors. The name is not well chosen, for the sub- stance deposited is not adipose, but rather like crude bees-wax. It was applied, however, by Stentzel, f the original writer on this subject, and it is unnecessary to change it, when its exact im- port is understood. Though it may occur pro- bably in any part of the arterial tubes, it takes place most frequently at the bifurcations of the arteries. It invariably commences in this par- ticular spot of the vessel; and when it occu- pies any extent of the tube, it will be found to * Morgagni Epist. XXIII. Art. iv. vi. XLV.

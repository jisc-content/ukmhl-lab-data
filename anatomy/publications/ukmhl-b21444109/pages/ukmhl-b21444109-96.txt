76 GENERAL ANATOMY. 3. The circular contraction of the calibre of an artery, either partially or wholly divided, de- pends not on irritability, but either on its elasti- city, or on that property which it possesses of contracting strongly the instant the distending agent is removed. This power, which was rather happily named by Bichat contractilite par clefaut d'extension, is quite different from muscular con- traction or irritability, and must not be confound- ed with them ; but it depends in a degree not much less on the living state of the body and the indi- vidual arterial tube. 4. The contraction said to take place in living arteries after the application of alcohol, acids, or alkalis, is to be ascribed to the chemical crispation, and not to stimulant power. It does not relax. 5. These inferences are not inconsistent with the experiments of Thom- son, Philips, Hastings, and others, on minute ar- terial tubes, which may be admitted to possess something like irritability, or rather susceptibility of contraction, without the necessity of supposing the same property in the large branches and trunks. 6. This is so much more probable, as in these minute arteries the proper arterial tunic is either wanting, or is so much thinner and so mo- dified, that it is impossible to conceive its presence capable of affecting the result of experiments made to determine the degree or kind of arterial con- traction. 3. The outer surface of the proper arterial tis- sue is enveloped, as above noticed, in a layer of

648 GENERAL ANATOMY. The first or gastro-pulmonary mucous surface comprehends that membranous surface which commences at the various orifices of the face at which it is contiguous with the skin ; and is con- tinued through the lacrymal and nasal passages, and even the Eustachian tube, by the larynx on the one hand to the windpipe and bronchial membrane, and by the oesophagus on the other through the entire tract of the alimentary canal, at the opposite extremity of which it is again identified with the skin. The distribution of the second division, or the genito-urinary mucous membrane, is slightly va- ried according to the differences of sex. In the male it is connected with the skin at the orifice of the urethra, from which it proceeds inwards toward the bladder; sending previously small prolongations through ducts on each side of the veru montanum, from which it is believed to be continued through the vasa deferentia, to the va- sa efferentia of the testicle. Continued over the inner surface of the urinary bladder, it is pro- longed through the ureters to the pelvis and in- fundibula of the kidney. In the female, besides passing in this direction, it ascends into the womb, and passes through the Fallopian or ute- rine tubes, at the upper extremity of which it ter- minates in an abrupt opening into the sac of the peritonaeumâ€”the only instance in the whole bo- dy in which a mucous and serous surface com- municate freely and directly.

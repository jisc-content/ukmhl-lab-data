274 GENERAL ANATOMY. This, as is well known, is situate in the space contained between the broad dorsal muscle, (latis' simus clorsi) behind, and the great pectoral mus- cle before, and is formed in the following manner. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves, and the first dorsal, after forming the usual connections, (ansae) pass downwards from the vicinity of the vertebrae between the middle and anterior scaleni muscles, and nearly opposite the lower margin of the seventh cervical verte- bra, or about the level of the first rib, begin to be united by the component threads of each nerve. Threads of the fifth and sixth cervical unite,— sometimes to form a single chord ; in other instan- ces to be connected a short space onward with threads of the seventh cervical in a similar man- ner. The seventh and eighth form two kinds of union. When the seventh is large, it divides al- most equally into two chords or branches, one of which is connected first with the fifth and sixth, afterwards with the eighth, and with the first dorsal by interlacement of minute nervous threads. The other either passes downward to form one of the separate brachial nerves, or is also connected with the eighth cervical and first dorsal in a plexi- form manner. gationibus spinalibus, aut ex earum plerisque, composites. Atque exinde sequitur, ut nervi brachiales dicti qui a plexu ad brachium, manum digitosque ejus omnes derivant, mini- me ad unarm, sed ad plures spinalium conjugationes, nempe ad quatuor cervicales inferiores et dorsalium primam per- tineant.—Anatom.

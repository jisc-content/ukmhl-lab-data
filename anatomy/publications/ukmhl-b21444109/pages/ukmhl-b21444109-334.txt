The anterior-upper lobe, with four sides and four angles, named therefore by Malacarne the quadri- lateral or four-sided lobe, {vierseitige, Reil,) ap- proaches somewhat to the figure of the trapezoid. It is bounded by three curved margins and one straight one. Of the former, the most anterior forms one-half of the semilunar fissure; while the poste- rior, which is also the longest, and parallel to this, is a curvilinear or circular tract (the great furrow,) extending from the bottom of the purse-like fis- sure behind to the anterior outline of the hemi- sphere before, where it terminates about one inch from the end of the semilunar fissure. This last space between the anterior end of the great fur- row forms the third curved margin of the four- sided lobe ; while its straight margin is made by the middle line, which here is common to the two lobes. Malacarne further divides this lobe into five lobules, and describes the limits of each with minuteness and accuracy. For the details of these distinctions I refer to the original. The posterior-upper lobe—the second division of the upper hemispherical surface—may be de- fined in the following manner. The circular tract or great furrow, which I have already said forms the posterior margin of the four-sided lobe, is its anterior tfoundary. The hemispherical outline of the upper surface, if traced from before backwards, 3

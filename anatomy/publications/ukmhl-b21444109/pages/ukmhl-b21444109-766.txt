GENERAL ANATOMY. 742 pearance, and completely destitute of fibres or any other trace of organic structure. From this smooth polished aspect, which is a peculiar attri- bute of the free surface of serous membrane, all the organs covered by it derive their glistening iap- pearance. Thus the exterior surface of the lungs derives its appearance from the pleura, the heart from the pericardium, the liver and intestinal ca- nal from the peritonaeum. A successful injection of size or turpentine, coloured with vermilion, brings into view so many capillary blood-vessels in this membrane, that it might be supposed at first sight to consist entirely of minute arteries and veins. Farther, by proper management, lym- phatics may be injected in it with quicksilver to a degree equally minute and delicate. From these experiments, therefore, it may be concluded, that serous membrane is chiefly composed of minute arteries and veins conveying colourless fluids, and of vessels connected with the general trunks of the lymphatic system. Whether it contain any- thing else but vessels of this kind, or has a pro- per substance or tissue, remains to be ascertain- ed. Though nerves are often seen passing along their outer or attached surface to the neighbour- ing tissues, none have hitherto been traced either into the pleura or peritonaeum. By most of the older anatomists, and among others by Haller, serous membrane is considered as of the nature of filamentous tissue or cellular mem- brane, more or less closely condensed, {tela cellulosa

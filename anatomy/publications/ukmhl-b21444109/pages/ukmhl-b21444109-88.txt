68 GENERAL ANATOMY. seems to contain fluid or semifluid matter. When cut open it is found to contain a soft semifluid matter of the consistence of honey, but of oily or adipose properties. In such circumstances the in- ner surface of the cyst, or at least the vessels of this surface, are the agents which secrete the fatty matter. This tumour may occur either in the fila- mentous or the adipose tissue ; but is to be regard- ed as an example of local deposition of adipose matter. It may appear in any region of the fila- mentovis tissue, but is most frequent about that of the head and face. Small steatoms are not unfre- quent in the eyelids and in the scalp. Larger ones are more frequent about the neck. The other forms of encysted tumours, distin- guished by the names of atheroma, {adi^^a/fjija. pulti- cula ab a^aga pultis genus), and meliceris {^zkiz,n^ig mel and cera, honey wax,) ai'e to be viewed rather as varieties of the steatom than as generically dif- ferent. The substance contained may differ in consistence, but is nearly the same in essential qualities. 7- Melanosis. I have already spoken of the me- lanotic deposition taking place in the filamentous tissue. The adipose membrane is also a frequent seat of this singular change. The black or mela- nose matter is found in the subcutaneous adipose membrane and the subjacent cellular tissue of the chest and belly ; it is not uncommon in the fat of the orbit; it is very commonly seen in the adipose cushion on the fore-part of the vertebral column.

MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 653 the arterial branches are ramified to great delicacy, and terminate in minute veins, which then unite into one trunk; while its inner surface he repre- sents as spongy and cellular. The space between the villi, which do not touch each other, he further represents to be occupied by the open orifices of follicles, so numerous that he counted eighty of them, where were eighteen villi; and both, he asserts, are covered by a thin but tenacious mem- brane similar to epidermis. Hewson, while he admits in each villus the ramification of minute arteries and veins, denies the saccular expansion, and infers that the lacteals are ramified in the same manner as the blood-ves- sels, and that the whole constitute a broad flat body,* the spongy appearance of which he ascribes to the mutual ramification of the latter. With this in general Cruickshank agrees ; f while Shel- don, who found the villi not only round and cylin- drical as Hewson, but bulbous as Lieberkuhn, and even sabre-shaped, rather confirms the statements of that anatomist. :|: Mascagni and Soemmering agreeing in the general fact of vascular and lacteal structure, seem to represent the shape of the vil- lus as that of a mushroom, consisting of a stalk and apileus. et Actione villorum Intestinorum Tenuium Hoininis.

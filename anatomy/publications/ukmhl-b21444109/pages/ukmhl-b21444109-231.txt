SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 209 In all these cases of hemorrhage two conditions of the capillary and exhalant system may be re- marked. First, In the capillaries an unusual pro- portion of blood is accumulated, so that the small ones conveying red blood become large and dis- tended, and those conveying the colourless part are injected with red blood. Secondly, After this state has continued for some time, red blood is observed to ooze in minute drops from the surface of the membrane, and progressively to increase in quantity and superficial extent. The cause of this accumulation and consequent exudation is not known. To assert, as Bichat has done, that a change in the organic sensibility of the exhalants opens a passage through them to red unchanged blood, is to describe the fact in a different mode without explaining its reason. The hemorrhagic effort of Stahl, and the error loci of Boerhaave, are equally true and not less intelligible. |3. In the recrementitial exhalants, and first in those of transparent or serous membranes, though less frequently, the same anormal condition may be often recognized. In the pleura or the peri- As this discharge happened instantly, and from the gentlest pressure of the nnger, it could not be transudation, which always requires time; it could not be rupture of vessel. I have had several opportunities of repeating this experiment, which always succeeded in the same manner."â€”The Anato- my of the Absorbing Vessels of the Human Body by Wil- liam Cruickshank. London, 1786- Chapter xi. The same fact has been satisfactorily established by observation in cases of prolapsed or retroverted uterus, when the blood is seen oozing from the villous surface of the organ. O

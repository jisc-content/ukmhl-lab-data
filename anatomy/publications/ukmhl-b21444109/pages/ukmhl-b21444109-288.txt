266 GENERAL ANATOMY. capillary cylinders containing a transparent gela- tinous fluid as Fontana represents, seems quite uncertain. It has been presumed, rather than demonstrated, that it resembles cerebral sub- stance. But this analogy, though admitted, would throw little light on the subject; for at present it is almost impossible to find two anatomical ob- servers who have the same views of the intimate nature of cerebral substance itself. Whatever be its intimate arrangement, it appears to be a se- cretion from the neurilematic vessels. (Reil.) The structure of the nervous chord may be de- monstrated in the following manner. When a portion of nerve is placed in an alkaline solution, the whole, or nearly the whole, of the nervous matter is softened and dissolved, or may be wash- ed out of the neurilematic canals, which are not affected by this agent, and the disposition of which may be then examined and demonstrated.* Aque- ous maceration may likewise be advantageously employed to unfold this structure; for it sepa- rates and decomposes the cellular tissue by which the neurilematic canals are united, and subse- quently occasions decomposition of the nervous substance, while it leaves, at least for some time, the neurileraa not much affected. When, how- ever, the maceration is too long continued, it is separated and detached like other macerated tex- tures. Lastly, If a large nerve be placed in diluted * J. C.

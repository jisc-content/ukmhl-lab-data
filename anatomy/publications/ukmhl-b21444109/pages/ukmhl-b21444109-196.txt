In the former great sickness and epigastric tender- ness, with more or less vomiting, are frequent, and in the latter constant symptoms. The vomiting, nevertheless, is not bilious, as has been too gene- rally imagined. It is at the commencement al- ways a watery fluid, evidently derived from the capillaries of the gastric, and perhaps the duo- denal mucous membrane. (Dr John Hunter, Jack- son, &c.) After some time it begins to be mixed with bile, expressed in aU probability from the gall-bladder by the pressure of the stomach in the act of vomiting. A much more uniform occur- rence, however, if the disease does not subside spontaneously, or is checked by art, is the gradual admixture of blood somewhat darkened with the watery fluid. This blood issues from the capil- laries of the gastric and intestinal tissues by a process analogous to exhalation in the sound state, but differing in so far as in the capillaries, from which it proceeds, a degree of disorganization has taken place. As the blood escapes into the cavity of the canal originally not highly scarlet, it is ra- pidly blackened by the action of the carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen gases, at all times pre- sent in greater or less quantity. This bloody exudation is at first scanty, but gradually increases as the disease goes on, until it constitutes the greater part of what is discharged both by vomit- ing and by stool. In the former case it forms the black vomit, (vomito jyrietoj or coffee-ground

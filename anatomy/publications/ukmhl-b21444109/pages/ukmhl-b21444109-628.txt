Its outer surface is be- lieved to be covered with imbricated scales, be- cause in moving a single hair between the finger and thumb it follows one direction only. Hair is believed to be utterly inorganic, though the phenomena of its growth, decoloration, and especially of the disease termed Polish plait, (plica Polonica,) have led various authors to regard it as possessed of some degree of vitality. These phe- nomena, however, may be explained by the occur- rence of disease in the bulbs or generating follicles. Hair is insoluble in boiling water, but Vauquelin succeeded in dissolving it by the aid of Papin's digester. From the experiments of this chemist, and those of Hatchett, it may be inferred that hair consists of an animal matter, which appears to be a modification of albumen, a colouring oil, and some saline substances.* Section 11. The cutaneous texture and appendages are liable to many forms of disease. Most of themj however, may be referred to some form of the inflammatory process, or to changes in texture either original or acquired. 1, InJIammation assumes in this textui'e a great variety of forms, which it is the province of pathological anatomy to distinguish accurately. This was first attempted by Cullen, whose phlegmon and crylhema were intended to designate two forms of cutaneous inflammation, according as the ves- sels of the internal or external surface are the seat of morbid Â» Annales de Chimie, I8O6.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 738 covered by serous membrane is not contained in that membrane, but is on its exterior surface, and that of every organ so situate one part at least, viz. that at which its vessels and nerves enter, is always imcovered. Thus the lungs are on the outer sm'face of the pleura; the heart is on the outside of the pericardium,; the stomach, intesr tines, liver, spleen, and pancreas, are on the out- side of the peritonceum; and the testicles are on the outside of the peridi/ditnis. In the same man- ner the lungs, though invested by pleura before and behind, at their apex and their base, are un- covered at their roots, or the points where the bronchial tubes and great blood-vessels enter their substance; the heart is uncovered by pericardium at the upper part of the auricular cavities; and the intestinal canal is uncovered along the whole of that longitudinal but tortuous line by which the mesentery is attached, and at which its proper vessels and nerves are transmitted. To comprehend the arrangement of the pellucid membranes still more distinctly, it is expedient, by an effort of abstraction, to trace the course of any one of them, having previously thrown out of the question the necessary means by which their in- terior or free surface is exposed. In this mental process also it is requisite to remember that there is no initial point save what is arbitrarily made. If, for example, the course of the pleura be traced, the membrane presents no natural mark or boun-: dary from which the anatomist is to commence his demonstration ; and he must fix artificially on

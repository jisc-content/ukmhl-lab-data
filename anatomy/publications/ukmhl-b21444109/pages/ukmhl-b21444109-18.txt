xiv PREFACE. elusion. On ordinary points, on which patholo- gical opinion is unanimous, I have been sparing of reference, or omitted it entirely. On subjects, on the contrary, on which information is doubt- ful and scanty, or on which there is room for diversity of sentiment, I have, by referring the reader to the best sources, enabled him to appre- ciate the validity of the conclusions stated. With- out attempting, however, to refer to all the autho- rities extant, which must have uselessly enlarged the work, I have directed him chiefly to those which are at once most useful and most accessible. Edinburgh, ^th November 1828.

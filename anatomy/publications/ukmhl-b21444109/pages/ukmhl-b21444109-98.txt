Morgagni was the first who, trusting to mere observation, the only sure guide in anatomical science, doubted the existence of these fibres, and was not ashamed to say he was unable to perceive them. * Upon the same ground Haller would not admit their exist- ence ; f and Bichat and Meckel positively deny them. I have repeatedly examined almost every considerable artery of the human body, and I have never been able to recognize any longitudinal fibres either in the middle or proper coat, or in the thin internal membrane, as taught by Willis, Douglas, and De La Sone. Though arterial tissue does not appear to be very vascular, it is furnished with arteries and veins (vasa vasorum, arteriolce arteriarum,) which do not come from the artery or vein itself, but from the neighbouring vessels. :j: Thus the aorta at its origin is supplied with minute arteries from the right and left coronary, and in some instances with a proper vessel adjoining to the orifice of the right coronary artery, which Haller regards as a third coronary. The rest of the thoracic aorta derives its vessels from the upper bronchials, from twigs of the internal mammary arteries, from the bronchials, from the oesophageals, and from the * Adversaria Anatomica, II. p. 78. •|- " Verum anatome et microscopium omnino fibres longi- tudinem sequentes numquam demonstravit, aut mihi, aut aliis, ante me, scriptoribus, quorum auctoritate meam tueor." —Elementa, Lib. ii. sect. 1. sect. 7.

LYMPHATIC SYSTEM, &C. 235 All the diseases to be referred to this head come naturally under two divisions. The first consists of disordered states occurring in the lymphatic vessels themselves. In the second are included morbid states of other textures or systems, arising immediately from disease of the lymphatics. 1. Inflammation. The first morbid state to be mentioned as incident to the lymphatics is inflam- mation. As a spontaneous occurrence it is little known, and perhaps is exceedingly rare. Hendy, indeed, undertook to show, that inflammation of the lymphatics was the pathological cause of Bar- badoes leg ; * and this view, which has been al- most implicitly adopted by every subsequent ob- server, has been strenuously maintained and illus- trated by M. Alard. f I have already adduced such facts and arguments as I conceive are suffi- cient to show, that this disease depends on a pecu- liar inflammation of the filamentous tissue of the limb, recurring periodically, and terminating in albuminous exudation; and that the affection of the lymphatic glands, vessels, &c. on which the hypothesis of Dr Hendy is founded, is an effect of this diseased state. It is unnecessary, therefore, to give the subject more consideration. * Treatise on the Glandular Disease of Barbadoes, proving it to be seated in the Lymphatic System. By John Hendy.

They are semitranslucent; their surface is smooth ; and neither openings at their surface, or cavity, or their interior, or vascular structure can be recognized.* In most mucous membranes are found mi- nute, oval, or spheroidal bodies, slightly elevated, and presenting an orifice leading to a blind or shut cavity. As they are believed to secrete a fluid analogous to or identical with mucus, they are named mucous glands ; and from their shape and situation they are also denominated follicles (folliculi) and cryptce. Though found in all the mucovis membranes in more or less abundance, they have been most frequently examined in those of the alimentary canal, where they were first accurately described by Peyer and Brunner. {GlandulcB PeyeriancB. f) In this situation they are situate in the substance of the mucous corion. Their structure, so far as it can be examined, is simple. The orifice leads into a saccular cavity, the surface of which is smooth and uniform, and appears to secrete the fluid which oozes from them. This membranous sac appears to be lodged in a reddish-coloured, dense, anormal matter, which is probably filamentous tissue enveloping minute blood-vessels; but of the minute structure of which nothing is accurately known.

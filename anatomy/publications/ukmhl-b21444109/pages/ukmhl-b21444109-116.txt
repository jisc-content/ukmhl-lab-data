96 GENERAL ANATOMY. ner and proper tunics of arteries. Its consistence may vary from that of purulent matter to the te- nacity of curd, or the granular firmness of cheese. Observed by the first Monro, by Haller, and others, it appears to be considered by Scarpa as a variety of the same change which I am afterwards to men- tion as steatomatous deposition. From this cer- tain circumstances show that it ought to be dis- tinguished. 1*^ Atheromatous deposition appears to arise from a sort of suppuration ; for, in gene- ral, it is possible to trace the transition from pu- rulent fluid to the concrete matter of atheroma. 2c?, This account of its origin derives strong con- firmation from the fact, that it almost always con- tains a patch or patches of calcareous matter in its centre, ^dly. It is associated much more fre- quently with the calcareous than with the steato- matous deposite. It is for these reasons not un- likely that the atheromatous deposition is to be viewed as one of the effects of chronic inflamma- tion, either in the inner or the proper tunic, or in both. 5. Steatomatous Deposition, either alone, or with calcareous patches, is often found between the inner surface of the proper membrane, and the outer surface of the internal one. Whether these deposites invariably derive their origin from the former or from the latter of these tissues, is not easy to say. In many instances they appear to be produced rather by the proper arterial tunic. 3

GENERAL ANATOMY. 230 arteries, unless in the case of those which arise from the interior of arterial tubes, (Lauth) is not satisfactorily established. It has been conjectured, however, that their ends or imperceptible origins are connected to the tissues to which they are traced, and that the lymphatics arise in this man- ner from these tissues. The lymphatics are distinguished by being in general cylindrical in figure, and by varying in calibre at short spaces. In this respect they dif- fer from the arteries and veins. It has been fur- ther justly remarked by Gordon, that the middle- sized lymphatics are remarkably distinguished from the corresponding parts of the arterial and venous system by three peculiarities. 1*^, When two lymphatics unite to form a third, the trunk thus formed is seldom or never larger than either of them separately ; '2,d, their anastomoses with each other are continual; and, 3c?, they seldom go a great space without first dividing into branches, and then reuniting into trunks. * The outer surface of a lymphatic is filamentous and rough, the inner smooth and polished, like that of small veins. It is impossible to observe the structure of these tubes in the middle-sized, or even in the large lymphatics ; and anatomists have generally been satisfied with supposing that the structure of all of them is similar to that of the thoracic duct, or some other large vessels equally susceptible of examination.

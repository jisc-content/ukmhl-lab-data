BRAIN, 361 mispheres in the form of thick, strong, white chords, named stalks or peduncles of the cerebel- lum. At the point at which they take this direc- tion they further receive a considerable accession from the restiform processes, the fibres of which are here seen to make a slight bend upwards, in order to follow the direction of the peduncles. Thus is composed a thick strong trunk of white matter, which on each side forms a sort of cen- tral pillar (Die Mai-ksaule, Die Pfeiler) to each cerebellic hemisphere. The interior an*ange- ment of this pillar or trunk is distinctly fibrous longitudinally, at its origin, or parting from the protuberance, and for a considerable distance from this point through the hemisphere. Unless I am misled by optical deception, the part derived from the restiform processes is also fibrous, and changes direction to accord with that of the peduncular bands. In the centre of the white fibrous pillar thus formed is contained a body consisting of a cap- sule of brownish matter enclosing a nucleus of white. The serrated or indented form in which both the nucleus and its capsule are arranged gives it the name of ciliary or moriform body ; (corpus ciliare, v. dentatum, c. moriforme, or rliomhoideum.) The capsule is incomplete at one end, that turned towards the base or root of the trunk. Each trunk or stem (Stamm) divides in- to a certain number of branches, (Aeste); each branch into a number of twigs, (Zweige); and to

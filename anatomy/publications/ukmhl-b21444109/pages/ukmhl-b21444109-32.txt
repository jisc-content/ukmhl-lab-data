12 GENERAL ANATOMY. * Bonn expanded, has given its author an imperisha- ble name, the small treatise of Bonn is equally unknown and unregarded, and has scarcely served to rescue his name from utter oblivion. 1790. I have already alluded to the application of the distinctions of general anatomy to pathology in the writings of Culien and John Hunter. A more complete specimen of this was given in 1790 by Dr Carmichael Smith, In a paper published in the second volume of the Medical Communica- tions of London,* this physician took a view of the phenomena and peculiarities of inflammation as they are observed in the different sorts of or- ganic substance found in the animal body. This may be regarded as the first systematic attempt in this country to trace the influence which different peculiarities of structure exercise on the pheno- mena and progress of morbid action. After this time various attempts were made to enumerate and classify the several animal sub- stances of which the human body consists, and to describe in general terms their obvious and distinctive characters and properties. M. Pinel, 1798. in his Nosographie Philosophique, first publish- ed in 1798, made the distinctions of the mem- branes and other animal tissues the foundation of his arrangement and pathology. Soon after Xa- 1800. vier Bichat, in his Treatise on the Membranes, gave a neat and comprehensive view of the general structure of these tissues, and of their connection * Transactions of a Society for Promoting Medical Know- ledge, Vol. II.

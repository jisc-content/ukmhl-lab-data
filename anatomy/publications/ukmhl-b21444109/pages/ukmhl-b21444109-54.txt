34 GENERAL ANATOMY. the divided surfaces are made eventually to unite. The process of granulation in the filamentous tis- sue is accompanied with more or less suppuration; but as the granulations coalesce, this is gradually diminished. 2. The second form of inflammation occurring in filamentous tissue is when it spreads, or is dif- fused along the membrane, or through its sub- stance. John Hunter was aware of the tendency which the inflammatory process in certain cir- cumstances manifests to spread ; and referring it to a sympathetic disposition in the surrounding parts, suggests an illustration in the opposite qua- lities of dry and damp paper. " If dry/' says he, " then it will not spread; it will be confined to its point; but if damp, it will spread, being at- tracted by the surrounding damp to which it has an affinity," (p. 2621.) Though this is a mere il- lustration, and is a statement of a physical, not a physiological phenomenon, it affords no imperfect idea of the distinction between the limited or cir- cumscribed, and the spreading or diffuse inflamma- tion. Two circumstances, however, appear to have perplexed the principles both of this author and of his successors. The first of these was the sense in which the terms erysipelas and erysipelatous inflammation were to be understood; the second the constant search for final causes, or ultimate in- tentions. By most physicians and surgeons, pre- vious to the time of Carmichael Smyth and Wil-

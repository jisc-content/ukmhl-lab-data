The cartilaginous system or tissue is found at least in three different situations of the human body; 1st, on the articular extremities of the move- able bones ; 2d, in the connecting surfaces or mar- gins of immoveable bones ; 3d, in the parietes of certain cavities, the motions or uses of which re- quire bodies of this elastic substance. The organization of gristle is obscure and in- distinct. On examination by the microscope, its structure is said to be uniform and homogeneous, like firm jelly, without fibres, plates, or cells. William Hunter, however, represents the articu- lar cartilages as consisting of longitudinal and transverse fibres. * Herissant represents those of the ribs as composed of minute fibres mutually aggregated into bundles connected by short slips, and twisted in a spiral or serpentine direction, f By Lassone, the articular cartilages are said to consist of a multitude of minute threads mutually connected and placed at right angles to the plane of the bone, but so as to radiate from the centre to the circumference. % The general fact of fibrous * Phil.

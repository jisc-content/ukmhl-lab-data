SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 173 the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum; while the constipation of the bowels at the commencement, insensibility to cathai'tic medicine throughout, and occasional looseness at the conclusion, indicate the deranged condition of those of the intestines. After death the minute vessels of the whole of these parts are found much distended with blood, generally dark-coloured. (Hamilton, Mills, Bate- man, Percival, &c.) The portal vein constitutes, among the vessels of the digestive organs, a secondary capillary sys- tem, in which the blood is not less accumulated than in the primary one. It may be thought, that, as the blood is accumulated in the first, it ought not so readily to find its way into the trunk, branches, and ramifications of the second. But this objection will vanish, when it is remembered that at the same time both the primary and the secondary system of capillaries become overload- ed. This state of the capillaries of the portal and hepatic system is established by the appearance of the liver in persons cut off by fever. The spleen may suffer so much from this ca- pillary distension as to resemble a mass of clotted blood without trace of organization. This morbid and extraordinary distension of the primary and secondary capillary systems of the chylopoietic organs, though distinct enough in the fevers of temperate countries, is most con- spicuously demonstrated in the agues and remit- tents of warm climates, and especially in the se-

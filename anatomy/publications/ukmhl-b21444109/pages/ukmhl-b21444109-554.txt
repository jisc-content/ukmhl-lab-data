532 GENERAL ANATOMY. older anatomists did; for though the middle or solid parts of long bones are denser and heavier than the ends of these bones, or the bodies of the vertebrae, the difference consists not in chemical composition, but in mechanical arrangement and structure. On dividing the head of a long bone, the lattice-work or cancelli,as they are named, are form- ed by many minute threads of bone, crossing and in- terlacing with each other. But each thread is quite as dense, and consists of the same quantity of ani- mal and earthy matter, as the most solid part of the centre of the same bone. These threads, how- ever, instead of being disposed closely and com- pactly with each other, so as to take a small space, are so arranged that they occupy a large one, and present a considerable bulk. Though bone has been submitted to analysis by many eminent chemists, the results hitherto ob- tained cannot be said to be quite satisfactory. The most recent is that of Berzelius, who, in 100 parts of bone from the thigh of an adult, gives the following proportions: of gelatine, 32.17; blood- vessels, 1.13 ; phosphate of lime, 51.04; carbon- ate of lime, 11.30 ; fluate of lime, 2.00; phosphate of magnesia, 1.16 ; hydrochlorate of soda and water, 1.20. These results by no means agree with those obtained by Fourcroy and Vauquelin, who found neither fluoric acid nor phosphate of magnesia, but discovered oxides of iron and manganese, silica, and alumina, in bone. Sulphate of lime, which

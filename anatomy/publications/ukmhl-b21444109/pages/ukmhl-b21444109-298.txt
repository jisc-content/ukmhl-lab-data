276 GENERAL ANATOMY. renal, are also surrounded with plexiform nervous filaments. In some instances these nervous fila- ments are so intimately connected with the arte- rial tubes as to lead some anatomists to consider them as forming a peculiar net-work surrounding the vessel, and to exercise great influence on the circulation. (Wrisberg, Ludwig, and Haase.) It is remarkable that the structure of the ner- vous chords which form a plexus has either ap- peared so simple as not to demand particular at- tention, or is so obscure as to be never noticed. Have the nervous chords and threads in such si- tuations their usual envelope ? Is the nervous matter in the chords quite the same as in other situations? Is there any other means of union, save the nervous substance itself? We believe there is no doubt that every chord in a plexus is provided with its neurilema as in other places ; but this neurilema is generally thinner and more delicate ; and the general neurilema seems to be wanting. Its mechanical properties of cohesion and resistance have not been examined. The view which has been given of the struc- ture or arrangement of the nervous plexus has led Scarpa to consider them as nearly allied to ganglions. The same separation of the com- ponent threads or filaments of the nerve or nerves, the same interlacement, and the same or similar formation of new chords, appear to take place in both orders of structure. A ganglion, indeed, he conceives, is a condensed or contracted plexus;

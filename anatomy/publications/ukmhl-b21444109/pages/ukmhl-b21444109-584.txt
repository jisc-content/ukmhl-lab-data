GENERAL ANATOMY. 560 er jaw, * in those of the pelvis, f in the femur, and wherever the structure is close and compact. In this manner the odontoid process of the epistrophe {vertebra dentata) has been known to be removed.]: In bones containing much cancellated structure, for instance the vertehrce, sternum, the carpal and tarsal bones, this suppurative destruction and death of the periosteum produces not death and exfoliation, but caries or ulceration, (rt^rihuv) with death of minute particles of bone, {separatio inseti- sibilis.) g. Certain forms of periosteal inflammation give rise simultaneously to osseous deposition and ul- ceration or caries. Thus nodose inflammation of the tibia and fibula may terminate in ulcers of the periosteum, and produce irregular deposition on the surface of these bones which appear thick, but without the usual aspect of healthy bone, pre- sent irregularly shaped masses of structure, partly like honey-comb cells and partitions, partly like confused network. The course of phenomena here is first chronic thickening and induration of the periosteum, with deposition of bone beneath it; then ulceration of the periosteum; and lastly, ul- ceration or caries in the new bony matter, which appears to continue to be deposited irregularly. * Exfoliations of the lower jaw from disease or injury of the alveolar processes are common. f In Mr J.Bell's case of Gluteal Aneurism exfoliation from the ilium and sacrum took place.

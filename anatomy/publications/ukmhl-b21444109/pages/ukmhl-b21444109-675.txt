MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 651 tons tissue, pretty firm and dense, and of a bluish white colour,â€”a character by which it is easily distinguished from the soft fawn-coloured mucous membrane. This submucous filamentous tissue is what is erroneously termed the nervous coat by Ruysch, Albinus, and some of the older anato- mists. In certain parts the mucous corion is co- vered by a thin membrane, which has been named the epidermis or cuticle. It is exceedingly difficult to demonstrate this membrane distinctly. It is very thin, quite trans- parent, and is perhaps most easily shown by boil- ing or scalding a portion of mucous membrane, and then peeling off with care the outer pellicle. This experiment succeeds best in the mucous membrane of the mouth and palate, in which, therefore, the existence of mucous epidermis can- not be doubted. The observations of Wepfer, Haller, and Nicholls, and especially of Bleuland, * are sufficient to prove its existence in the oesopha- gus. Bichat admits that, though it can be de- monstrated at the cutaneous junctions of the rau- cous surfaces, it can no longer be shown to exist in the stomach, intestines, bladder, &c. Beclard renders this conclusion more precise, by showing experimentally that mucous epidermis cannot be traced in the oesophagus beyond the cardia; in the genito-urinary system beyond the neck of the womb, and that of the bladder. * Jant Bleuland, M.

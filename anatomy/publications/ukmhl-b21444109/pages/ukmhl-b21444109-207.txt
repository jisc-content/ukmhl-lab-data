185 ERECTILE TISSUE. The cavernous body of the urethra, or what is now termed its spongy body, * is represented by Haller to consist of fibres and plates issuing from the inner surface of the containing membrane, and mutually interlacing, so as to form a series of communicating cells, f into which the proper urethral arteries pour their blood directly during the state of erection. % The cavernous body of the penis is in like manner represented to be a part of a spongy na- ture, or to consist of innumerable sacs or cells se- parated by plates and fibres, which at the moment of erection were distended with blood poured from the arteries, and which was afterwards re- moved by some absorbing power of the veins. This opinion, which was that of many subse- quent anatomists, even Bichat himself, * was de- rived apparently from the facility with which the blood so deposited escapes, not, as it was believed, from divided vessels, but from areolce, or inter- laminar spaces. It appears, however, to have been at variance with what had been anciently * Haller applies the name of cavernous body not only to the structure of the penis, but to that of the urethra Elem.

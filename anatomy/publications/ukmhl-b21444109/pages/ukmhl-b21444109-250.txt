Meckel, the grandfather, maintained the communication, from the circumstance, that he injected the lymphatics from the veins. Hew- son, though not doubting the fact, regards it as an exception to the general rule. Cruickshank again, states that he never saw a lymphatic vessel inserted into any other red veins than the sub- clavians and jugulars. The termination remark- ed by Steno and his successors constitutes in truth the common trunk or lymphatic vein ad- mitted by Cruickshank,â€”a thoracic duct of the right side. Recently this mode of termination has been re- vived by Tiedemann and Fohman, * who, in the seal, state that the lactiferous vessels communicate with veins arising from the mesenteric glands, and pass thence into the venous trunks without proceeding through the thoracic duct. This, how- ever, has been shown by Dr Knox to be a mistake, resulting from the decomposed state of the animals examined by the German anatomists f. M. Lauth Junior of Strasbourg, again, conceives that he has demonstrated, that lymphatics communicate with veins within the substance of organs, and in the interior of the lymphatic glands \\ an inference * Anatomische Untersuchungen uber die Verbindung der Saugadern mit den Venen.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 140 or that which consists of the minute terniiuations of the aortic divisions, and the origins of the su- perior a.nd inferior great veins ; and, 9.cl, The pul- monary capillary system, or that which consists of the minute terminations of the pulmonary ar- tery, and the origins of the pulmonary veins. It is evident, that the manner in which the first of these systems is here represented, communicates a very incorrect idea of its true character; and that there is actually an individual capillary sys- tem, not only for every organ, but in some in- stances for every tissue. The brain possesses an individual capillary system ; and that of the mem- branes is evidently distinct from that belonging to the organ itself. The heart and the kidneys pos- sess each an individual capillary system ; and the liver may be said to have two,â€”one formed by the communication of the hepatic artery and veins, and another consisting of the divisions of the por- tal vein, with the branches of the hepatic hollow vein. (Vena cava hepatica.) The organic properties of the capillary vessels are as little known as their structm-e. Many phy- siological and pathological writers, especially ex- perimentalists, have ascribed to them a power which has at different times been called muscular, tonic, irritable, contractile; and have asserted, that, because the larger arteries are provided with a fibrous membrane, which they have called mus- cular, and to which they have ascribed irritability, or the power of contraction when stimulated, their

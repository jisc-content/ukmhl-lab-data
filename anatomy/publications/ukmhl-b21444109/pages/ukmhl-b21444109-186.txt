GENERAL ANATOMY 164 sooner or later becomes general and severe. In this sense only can snppuration be said to cause inflammation. But the proper view of the rela- tion of these two processes is, that chronic inflam- mation may cause the acute form by the capillaries assviming a new mode of action, or by propagating the irritation to those of a new texture. In cir- cumstances of this description suppuration is in general without granulation or attempt at rejjair. B. Suppuration may be either ^^â– ithout attempt at repair, or with absolute destruction of texture; and it is then distinguished as i(lcerafio7i, or the for- mation of an ulcer. Since the time of Hunter, who gave the first clear idea of this process, ul- ceration has been generally imdcrstood to consist in absorption with supptfra/ion. This notion is perhaps more hyjjothetical than the old one of breach of surface or loss of substance, which sim- ply expressed the fact without reference to its sup- posed cause. But as loss of substance imphes the absorption or resumption of part of the animal texture, and as this must be understood to be ef- fected by the vessels of the part, the chief objec- tion with which this opinion can be charged, is, that not only the lymphatics, but the minute veins must be concerned in the process of resumption. I do not propose here to consider all the various forms of ulceration, or the circiunstanccs under which it may take place. But I shall mention a few by way of example. Ulceration occurs in the skin in consequence of

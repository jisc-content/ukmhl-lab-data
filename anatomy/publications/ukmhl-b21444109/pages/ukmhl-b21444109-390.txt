GENERAL ANATOMY. 368 and Prochaska himself, are found in the conclu- sion of his description of this organ. * From thirty-one experimental observations on the cerebral matter of the human subject, in various mammiferous animals, fowls, and fishes, Joseph and Charles Wenzel of Tubingen have drawn the conclusion ;—that the gray and white (cortical and medullary) matter of the human brain, the substance of the colliculi, (optic cham- bers and striated bodies,) that of the conarium, spinal chord, and nerves; in short, the mass of brain in mammiferous animals, birds, and fishes, consists of the same small roundish bo- dies, mutually cohering, of which the substance of muscle, liver, spleen, and kidney is composed ; that as these minute bodies derive their shape from the cells of the cellular tissue, the sub- stance of brain, spinal chord, and nervous matter, appears to consist of the same roundish minute bodies; but that the relative size of these cells can- not be determined. These conclusions throw little light on the point at issue,—the minute structure of the cere- bral matter in general; and it must be said that the microscopical observations and chemical expe- riments of these anatomists do not communicate information proportioned either to their num- ber or to the elaborate assiduity with which they appear to have been conducted.

BONE. 575 vertebrae become carious. Chronic inflamma- tion affects the synovial membrane and cartilages of an oblique process, and passing into the bone produces ulceration and carious excavations. This process not unfrequently causes in the incum- bent and contiguous textures, irritative suppura- tion constituting an extensive abscess, which, ac- cording to circumstances, may take the anterior, the posterior, or the inferior direction. As the original seat of the disease is generally the lower dorsal or upper lumbar vertebrae, the disease is termed lumbar abscess.^ It may appear either in the lumbar region, at the margin of the rectum, or in the groin. Several vertebrae are found ex- cavated or destroyed by caries. As in the other articulations, however, this disease may terminate in irregular osseous union of several vertebrae, forming a species of ankylosis. The forms of disease now enumerated are chief- ly varieties or effects of the inflammatory process. Those which yet demand attention, though de- pendent in like manner on some anormal action of the periosteal or medullary vessels, are never- theless so peculiar, that it is impossible to refer them to the same general head. 4. Rickets. Rachitis. This disease, of which no distinct trace is found in the writings of the an- cients, or in those of the authors of the middle ages, was first described by Glisson as appearing in England in the course of the 17th century. * Camper, Demonst.

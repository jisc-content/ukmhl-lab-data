FILAMENTOUS OR CELLULAR TISSUE. 31 mediastinHm. Passing downwards, the same com- munication may be traced with the intermuscular tissue of the loins and belly, the tissue surround- ing the lumbar and sacral portion of the verte- bral column, that connecting the mesentery and large vessels to the vertebrse, and extending all round under the muscular peritonaeum, and into the pelvis, where, by means of the tissue at the pos- terior surface of the abdominal muscles, at the an- terior surface of the iliacus interims, and through the obturator hole and ischiatic notch, it commu- nicates with the filamentous tissue of the lower ex- tremities. From the rectum and branches of the ischium it is continued along the perinaeum by the urethra, and into the scrotum. In the whole of this course it is abundant in the space before the vertebrse round the jisoec and ili- acus internus muscles, and round the bladder, rectum, prostate gland, and womb. The tissue surrounding the vertebral column communicates with that in the interior of the column by the intervertebral holes. The arm-pit may be considered as the point of union between the filamentous tissue of the trunk and that of the upper extremities, while the groin is the corresponding spot for the lower extremi- ties. These facts should be kept in mind in ob- serving the phenomena of diseases of this tissue. Notwithstanding this general connection, how- ever, certain parts of the tissue are so dense and close as to diminish greatly the facihty of com-

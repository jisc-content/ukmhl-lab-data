724 GENERAL ANATOMY. nish.* To its entire disappearance, however, the absorption of the effused lymph is essentially necessary ; and in all pro- bability this is never completely effected. In the intestinal canal especially, this induration may be so great that the tissue of the tube becomes hard and firm like parchment or cartilage, and at the same time much thicker than na- tural. The calibre of the canal then becomes so much con- tracted that nothing passes through it; and life is termi- nated, partly by inanition and deficient nutrition, partly by irritation. I have already alluded to partial contractions re- corded by various authors, from Haase, Wincker, and Lau- bius to Dr Combe and Willan. The most perfect example of total contraction with which I am acquainted is recorded by M. Tartra in his Essay on Poisoning by Nitric Acid. In an individual who died three months after swallowing this poison, the alimentary canal was reduced to so small volume, that it might have been held in the hollow of the hand. Its coats were shrivelled, crisp, and indurated; and its calibre through its wliole length did not exceed that of a common quill, t Under such circumstances, all the intestinal tissues suffer successively and simultaneously the effects of the in- flammatory process; and the contraction is augmented by the violent and excessive stimulus which it applies to the muscular layer. That a similar change takes place in the mucous and sub- mucous tissues of the bladder is shown by the observations of Guarinonius, Bonetus, Camerarius, Targioni, Morgagni,;}: Dr Barry, § Dr Gilchrist, || Desault, f Baillie, ** Fr.

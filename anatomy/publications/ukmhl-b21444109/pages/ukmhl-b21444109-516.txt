GENERAL ANATOMY. 494 ilium to the small trochanter. * Three similar cases described by Mr Howship form the clearest ac- count of the anatomical characters of this dis- ease, f In such instances, since there is either no affection, or at least no primary affection, of the bones of the spine, it must be inferred that the dis^- ease consists in suppurative inflammation either of the muscular tissue, or at least of the filamentous tissue of the muscles. The structure of these mus- cles, especially that of the psoas, is greatly more delicate than that of any other large muscle, and may have some influence in the destructive seropu- rulent secretion which follows. Is the muscular texture destroyed or merely separated ? I have seen discharged along with the fluid of lumbar abscess capillary filaments, brownish, firm, and evidently the remains of the muscular fibres. At the same time, in the dissections above quoted, no fibres are mentioned in the purulent cyst. The acute form of muscular inflammation is more rare, but sometimes occurs in the muscles of the abdomen, of the chest, of the thigh or leg, in persons of broken constitution and diseased habits. By some authors, however, the muscular fibre is believed to be incapable of inflammation; and the instances ascribed to it are by them said to be in- flammation of the intermuscular cellular tissue.

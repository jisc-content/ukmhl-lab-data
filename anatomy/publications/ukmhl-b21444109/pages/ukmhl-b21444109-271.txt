LYMPHATIC GLAND OR GANGLION. 249 * The Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 122. brown, covered with a foul blood-coloured serous fluid, without appearance of granulations, and with the sensation of burning or searing pain. The pro- cess of sloughing proceeds in the cellular tissue, while the gland or glands remain as so many brown- ish masses, with small marks of vitality, until they are detached entirely from the cellular substance, in which they are imbedded, and are thrown off dead. In effecting this object, the process of sloughing may proceed to such extremity as to af- fect first the superincumbent cellular coat, and next the sheath of the femoral artery, which, in such circumstances, inevitably gives way ; and the patient is suddenly destroyed by hemorrhage. An instance of this accident in a soldier of the guards used to be mentioned by Dr Hunter. * In a case which occurred some years ago in the military hospital of the Castle, it was deemed requisite to avert the impending danger by tying the femoral artery. Subsequent gangrene of the foot and leg, however, rendered ampvitation indispensable; and recovery at length took place. In more favourable circumstances, after great destruction of parts, and the expulsion of one, two, or more mortified glands, the phagedenic action stops spontaneously, granulation takes place, and the sore is gradually healed. I have described the progress and phenomena of this disease, as I have witnessed them in seve- ral instances which have fallen under my observa- tion. It appears that the active symptoms mani-

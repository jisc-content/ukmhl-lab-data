205 SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. To obstruction of this description M. Bouillaiid traced several instances of partial dropsy. Of the influence of the second cause in producing dropsical effusion, we have examples in that which results from enlargement of the right side of the heart, ossification and contraction of the mitral or semilunar valves, ossification of the coronary ar- teries, aneurism of the aorta or innominata, or even of the coeliac artery, all of which give rise to more or less serous effusion in the pleura, or a symptomatic dropsy of the chest. The third condition is perhaps the most com- mon origin of the symptomatic or secondary drop- sies. Whatever retards the free circulation of blood through the minute arteries and veins of any organ or texture will produce one or other of the following effects ; viz. inflammation, injection with effusion of red blood, or effusion of serous fluid from the exhalants, according to circumstan- ces. In subjects where the strvicture of the parts is somewhat lax and yielding, the last wiU be the most likely result; and it may be regarded as the mere consequence of the mechanical obstruction which the blood encounters in its transit from the capillary vessels to the larger trunks. " The com- pression of a vein," it is judiciously remarked by Hewson, " may, by stopping the return of the blood, not only distend the small veins, but the small arteries ; and the exhalants may be so dilat- interne des hopitaux civils de Paris.â€”Arcliives Generales de Medecine, Tome II. p. 18S.

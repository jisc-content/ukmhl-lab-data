GENERAL ANATOMY. 378 the part becomes yellow, or gray, or grayish brown, (suhfusca) very soft and pulpy, or even semifluid. It is perhaps equally rare in this as in the former case, to find perfect purulent matter in a distinct cavity. This change, which is often mentioned by Morgagni, * is one form of the dis- ease described by Rostan f and Lallemand, X un- der the name of softening (ramoUissement) of the hrain. The softening is a mere effect of the pro- cess of inflammation, subacute or chronic. In some instances the softening is attended with ef- fusion of serous fluid, without much discoloration of the part. Subacute or chronic inflammation, terminating in softening of the brain, may take place either on the convoluted surface of the organ, when it ge- nerally occupies an extent of two or three square inches ; or at the figurate surface, when it is most common on the middle portion, {septum lucidum,) and extending along the twain-band ; or in the substance of the organ, when it affects most fre- * Epistola, V. 6, 7- IX. 16, 18, 19.

The cases examined necroscopically show the cerebral vessels to be much distended with blood, sometimes bloody extravasation. In other in- stances which belong to a different head, the dis- tended vessels are accompanied with serous effu- sion between the membranes, or into the cavities. The anatomical character of soporose ague is therefore inordinate injection of the cerebral ca- pillaries. This constitutes in various degrees the sleepy quotidian (C. Piso, Obs. 178,) the sleepy, lethar- gic, hemiplegic, carotic, and apoplectic tertian, (Werlhof, Torti, Lautter, Morton,) and the coma- tose quartan (Piso, Werlhof;) and is the disease which has been named by Baglivi * and Lancisi f epidemic apoplexy (apoplexia Jehricosa, carus Je- hricosus), and which Morgagni \ and Casimir Medicus ยง represent as periodical and intermit- ting. When it is known that the apoplectic symp- toms are regulated by the motions of the ague, * G. Baglivi Dissertatio 8vo, De Observationibus, &c.

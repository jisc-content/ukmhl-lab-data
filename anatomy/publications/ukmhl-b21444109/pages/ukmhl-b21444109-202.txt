The bladder in like manner under- goes the same change; and in its thickened and indiu'ated tissue also dissection shows a more copious supply of blood, and a more abundant dis- tribution of vessels than in the natural state. Of this preternatural increase of bulk and den- sity the capillaries of the organs are the sole agents. In some instances this hypertrophy ap- pears to be of the nature of a chronic process of inflammation. This is exemplified in the case of the liver, the testicle, the prostate gland, the fe- male breast, and even the heart. |8. Any individual texture may undergo a pre- ternatural or anormal enlargement by local depo- sition of matter similar to itself. Thus a bone may become enlarged, as in exos/osis; a gland may become enlarged, as in various instances the testi- cle and the female breast do. That the skin is liable to a particular species of hypertrophic aug- mentation is well ascertained from cases given by many authors, but especially from one re- corded by Mr John Bell.* In mucous mem- brane, lymphatic gland, and secreting glands, si- milar local augmentations take place. y. In any tissue or organ a deposition of new matter altogether foreign to that tissue may take place. This new matter may be either similar to that of some natural tissue of the animal body; for example, it may be serous membrane, or bone, * Principles of Surgery, Vol. III. Discourse ii.

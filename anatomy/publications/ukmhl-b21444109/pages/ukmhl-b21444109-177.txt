SYSTEM OF CAPILLARY VESSELS, &C. 155 is filamentous or cellular tissue. It is certain also that bone is reproduced. But it is uncertain whe- ther skin, that is true skin, muscle, tendon, or li- gament, is reproduced, and almost certain that cartilage is not. 5. Different effects of infiamynation. I have said that granulation is in general accompanied with the formation of more or less purulent matter. This process, which is termed suppuration, generally precedes that of granulation. It has been viewed at one time as a consequence or effect of inflamma- tion, at another as a character of it, and at a third as a cause. The circumstances which justify these distinctions should be understood. Inflammation is a progressive process, which tends through certain stages to a certain termina- tion. Of the intermediate steps not much is known with certainty; and pathological writers have distinguished chiefly the different modes in which it may terminate. These are resolution, effusion, adhesion, suppuration, granulation, ul- ceration, cicatrization, induration, and gangrene. This division is more scholastic than natural. The first only can be justly denominated a termination. All the others are to be regarded as effects either immediate or remote of the process. a. Resolution is that action in which the red- ness, pain, heat, and swelling of an inflamed part gradually disappear, either spontaneously or un- der the use of means, with or without sensible evacuation, and in which the part which had been

This was the case in the walls of an an- fractuous irregular cavity without membrane, and containing two spoonfuls of clear yellowish fluid. The tubercular matter formed the centre and the three upper fourths of the tumour. The rest was what is described as cancerous,—a firm grayish" white shining tissue, traversed in all directions by blood-vessels, and presenting even a minute bloody effusion. Though the tumour was without cyst, its surface was covered by a celluloso-vascular tis- sue, which sent numerous irregular productions into the substance. It was surrounded by a layer of cerebral matter, reduced as usual to the consist- ence of thick cream. * Z,.

534 GENERAL ANATOMY. there no albumen in this animal matter? The sulphur formed during calcination seems to show that there is. There is no fat in bones ; and in the experiments in which this substance has been found, it is evident that it was merely marrow which had been mingled with the bones employed, or which had not been removed. Though bones were arranged by the ancients among the bloodless organic substances, they re- ceive a considerable proportion of this fluid, and injection shows them to be highly vascular. In early life especially these vessels are numerous; and even in the grown adult, Avhen death takes place by strangulation or by drowning, the bones are found to be naturally well injected. In old age the vessels are less numerous, but they are larger. From the capillary vessels distributed through their substance, bones derive the pale blue or light pink colour by which the healthy bone is characterized. When this tint becomes intense, it indicates inflammation or some morbid state of the vessels of the bone. When it is lost, and the bone assumes a white or yellow colour, the pai't so changed is dead. Anatomists distinguish three orders of vessels which enter the substance of bones; the first, those which penetrate the bodies of long bones to the medullary cavity, (arteriee nutritice, arterice meduUares;) the second those which go to the cellular structure of the bone ; and the third those which go to the compact or dense matter of the

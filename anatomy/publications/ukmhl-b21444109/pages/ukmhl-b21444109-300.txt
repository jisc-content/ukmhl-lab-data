GENERAL ANATOMY. 278 milunar cartilages of the knee-joint; those of the temporo-maxillary articulation; those of the inter- vertebral spaces ; marrow ; the lymphatic glands. To this we may add the testimony of a profes- sed anatomist of the nervous system, whose repu- tation for patient and industrious research cannot fail to sanction every thing which he has ad- vanced. " In every subject," says Walter of Ber- lin, " in which I was desirous to trace the nerves, I injected the arteries with red-coloured wax, the veins with green, and even the lymphatics with quicksilver, so that I was able to distinguish the nervous filaments from each of these orders of vessels. By this contrivance, though it occupied much time and labour, yet 1 was satisfactorily convinced that the pleura, the pericardium, the thoracic duct, and the peritoneum, receive no nerves. Nay, that, contrary to the opinions of the most eminent recent anatomists, no nerves termi- nate in the lymphatic or conglobate glands. Some- times, indeed, these organs are perforated by one or two twigs, as I have often had occasion to ob- serve ; but they instantly proceed to the next place assigned to them, and in which they are fi- nally lost." * If after this conclusion of Walter personal testimony can be of any use, I may add, that I have examined the dura mater, the perios- teum, and most of the synovial membranes re- peatedly, to discover nervous filaments in them, * Praefat.

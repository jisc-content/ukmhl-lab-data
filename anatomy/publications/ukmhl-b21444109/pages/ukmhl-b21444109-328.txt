GENERAL ANATOMY. 306 however, for the sake of more precision, be mark- ed by this adventitious character. * It may be named the cerebellic region of the convoluted^sur- face. The ordinary appearance of the convoluted sur- face is well known. It is formed of cerebral mat- ter, of a gray or dirty wax colour, the surface of which is smooth and polished, where it has not been rent by the removal of the membranes and their attachments. The convolutions consist of longitudinal eminences, rounded transversely, run- ning in various directions, and separated from each other by deep furrows. If these be examined when the membranous coverings are removed, they are observed to present may minute orifices, into which the soft membrane {'hz'Trrn [^fiviy^, meninx tenuis, pia mater) transmits filamentous bodies, most of them minute blood-vessels. They are neither arteries nor veins exclusively, but seem to consist of both. Neither the eminences, nor the hollows or de- pressions, are uniform in number or distribution; â€¢ Lest the use of these terms be objectionable by their ob- scurity, I may observe, that in describing parts of the human body, it is not unfrequently requisite to have recourse not only to marks on the organ described, but also to certain characters belonging to the contiguous parts. The first of these may be named the organic or innate, as they belong to the organ; the second, which do not belong to it, should be named advenlitious or esoteric. This is indispensable in rela- tive anatomy.

GENERAL ANATOMY. 120 way higher. * Nervous branches, or rather fila- ments, are observed in the pulmonary artery and great veins only. Are they derived from the great sympathetic, as is generally said ? In the veins, as in the arteries, the anatomist recognizes two extremities, the cardiac or collect- ed, and the organic or the ramified. Examined physiologically, however, the terms origin and ter- mination are not of the same import as when ap- plied to the arteries. In reference to the veins, they become convertible terms; and it is the usage even of writers on anatomy to represent the veins as arising where the arteries terminate, and ter- minating at the organ from which the latter arise. This distinction must be kept in view in the fol- lowing observations. The cardiac extremity or termination of the veins is so well known as to render any minute explanation unnecessary. The organic extremity or origin of the venous system is more obscure and difficult to be under- stood. It is indeed impossible to trace the origin of the small venous vessels, unless in the manner in which Leuenhoek, j William Cowper, | Henry * Hunter, x. Of Veins, p. 181. t Arcana Naturae Detect.

Cowper saw this communication of arteries and veins not only in cold- blooded animals, as the lizard, tadpole, and fishes, but in the omentum of a young cat and a dog.

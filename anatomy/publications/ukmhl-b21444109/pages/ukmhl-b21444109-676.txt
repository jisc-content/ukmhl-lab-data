652 GENERAL ANATOMY. The structure of mucous membrane varies in every situation and in every organ ; and the first peculiarity which it is important to notice is the existence of minute piles or villosities in the gas- tro-enteric division. These bodies are best seen by detaching, inverting, and inflating a portion of ileum. When this is immersed in pure water, the observer may perceive, by means of its refracting power, an infinite number of minute prolongations, which are made to wave or move gently amidst the fluid ; but even a very powerful magnifying glass does not render them so distinct as to deter- mine whether they are round or flattened, whether they are solid or hollow, or whether they are ob- tuse or acuminated. The shape and structure of these villosities are indeed imperfectly known. These piles, (villi, die zotten,) though seen by many anatomists, were first examined in 1721 by Helvetius, who represents them as cylindrical pro- minences in quadrupeds, but conical in the human subject. * Their intimate structure, however, Lieberkuhn undertook first by microscopical ob- servation to demonstrate. According to this ob- server, each villus receives a minute branch of a lacteal, arterial branches, a vein and a nerve; and in each the lacteal branch is expanded into a mi- nute sac or bladder {ampuUula, vesiada,) like an egg, the capacity of which he estimates at ith of a cubic line, and in the apex of which may be seen by the microscope a minute opening.f Upon this sac * Mem. de I'Acad. des Sciences, 1721. t J.

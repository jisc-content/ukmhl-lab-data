Farther, it was my intention to conclude the work with an account of the healthy structure and the morbid changes of the Glandular system.

This, therefore, I am obliged to defer for the present. Lastly, the limits within which it is requi- site to confine this work, principally intended for the student of pathology, have compelled me to touch very cursorily on many points, which, from their importance, would have required fuller de- tails.

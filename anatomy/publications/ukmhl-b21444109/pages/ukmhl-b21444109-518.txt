496 GENERAL ANATOMY. The muscular substance of the auricles was soft- ened and loaded with blood ; but without puru- lent deposits.* It cannot be denied that in this case the muscular tissue of the organ exhibited marks of inflammation ; but the purulent deposits might be seated in the intermuscular filamentous tissue, which, though delicate, is abundant. Abscess and ulceration of muscular tissue are the result of local or punctuate inflammation. In the former case a cavity, with smooth walls, con- taining purulent matter, is formed in one region of the muscular substance. In the latter a rugged irregular surface, produced by ulcerative absorp- tion or erosion, takes place near the surface of the muscle. The examples of both forms, as they take place in the heart, are the most interesting to the pathologist. Of abscess in this organ, instances are given by Poterius, Benivenius, Cornax, Nico- laus Massa, Fanton, and Laennec. Of ulcers on the outer surface, instances were seen by Olaus Bor- richius, f Riverius, ^ Job a Meckreen, ยง Peter de Marchettis, II Malpighi,<[y Peyer,** Graetz, and Morgagni.ff The ulcer occurring in the inner surface of the heart was seen by Morgagni, (Epist. xxiv. 17,) and by Laennec, who found one an inch long, half an inch broad, and more than four lines * Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, Vol. vii. p. 323. + Bartholini, Acta Med.

548 GENERAL ANATOMY. alveoli. As these cavities are formed, they are lined by a large, soft, membranous, vascular sac, which, in the manner of a serous membrane, con- sists of two divisions, one lining the alveolus, the other folded within that, and forming a closed ca- vity. In the inside of this cavity the process of dentition commences some time between the fifth and seventh month, by the deposition of matter from the vessels at the lowest point of the alveo- lar division of the sac. This matter is to consti- tute the crown of the tooth, which is invariably formed first. After the deposition of the first portions, these are pushed upwards by the addi- tion of successive layers below them, and neces- sarily carry the inflected part of I he sac before them. As this process of deposition advances, the tooth gradually fiUs the sac, and rises tiU it reaches the level of the alveolar margins. If a tooth be examined in situ, near the period of birth, it is found to consist of the crown, with portions of enamel descending on every side, and forming a cavity in which a cluster of blood-ves- sels, proceeding from the sac, is lodged. After the enamel has been deposited the bone begins to be formed ; and as this process advan- ces, the tooth is still forcibly thrust upwards by the addition of matter to its root. When the latter is well completed, the vessels become smal- ler and less abundant; until, when the tooth is perfect, they shrink to a mere membrane, which lines the cavity of the tooth, and still maintains

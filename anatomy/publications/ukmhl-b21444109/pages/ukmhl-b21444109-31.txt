DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 11 neurotic expansions ; 2c?, The periosteum and pe- richondrium, with their modifications and uses ; and shows that one or other of these membranes invests and connects every bone of the skeleton. In the third division he places the internal membranes of cavities, or those which are now de- nominated serous and fibro-serous membranes. He first traces at great length the course and di- visions of the dura mater and jom mater, and con- tends that they accompany each ne'rve and nervous branch ; then examines the course of the pleura and pericardium, and the relations of the me- diastinum ; and, lastly, he describes the extent of the peritoneum and its several divisions in con- nection with the organs contained in the abdomi- nal cavity.* The quantity of accurate information which Bonn has here collected, and the new and inte- resting views which he communicates are truly wonderful. This essay is one of the best speci- mens of correct and useful generalization which can be imagined ; and it is an example of the ca- pricious nature of scientific reputation, that while the work of Bichat, which was published forty years after, though little more than the thesis of * Specimen Anatomico-Medicum Inaugurale de Continua- tionibus Membi'anarum, quod publicae ac solemni disquisi- tioni submisit Andreas Bonn, Amstelaedamo-Batavus ad die 14 Octobris 1763.

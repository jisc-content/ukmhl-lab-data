In the inner membrane chronic in- flammation may cause partial effusion of lymph, which becoming organized gives rise, as already mentioned, to the fungous growths and vegeta- tions. It may render the membrane opaque and thick, and give it a shrivelled puckered appear- ance. It may cause a tubercular thickening either of the membrane or of the semilunar valves. It may induce gristly induration especial- ly in these and in the mitral valve. (C.) Or, lastly, there is reason to believe it is often the agent of the process next to be considered,—calcareous deposi- tion. 3. Ossification, Earthy Degeneration of Scar- pa ; Calcareous Deposition. It has been long known that arteries are liable to deposition of cal- careous matter. By De La Sone it was first re- marked that this process takes place in the inner membrane only ; * and Bichat afterwards referred it to the outer or attached surface of the membrane, an opinion in which he is supported by the testimo- ny of Meckel, Scarpa, Hodgson, and others. Scarpa only admits as a possible alternative its deposition in the interval between the inner and proper coat in the delicate tissue termed second cellular by Hal- ler.f ByJourdan and Breschet, however, the trans- lators of the work of Meckel, who contend that the internal membrane is never ossified, it is posi- tively stated that the calcareous matter is accu- * Memoires de I'Academie Royale, I756. p. 199^ 12mo. + SivlW Aneinisma^ Capitolo v. § 22.

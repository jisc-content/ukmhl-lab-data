539 BONE. the completion of growth, the bones undergo changes in which various stages may be distin- guished. In the first weeks of foetal existence it is impossible to recognize any thing like bone ; and the points in which the bones are afterwards to be developed consist of a soft homogeneous mass of animal matter, which has been designat- ed under the general name of mucus. Sometime between the fifth and the seventh week, in the situation of the extremities, may be recognized dark opaque spots, which are firmer and more solid than the surrounding animal matter. About the eighth week, the extremities may be seen to consist of their component parts, in the centre of each of which is a cylindrical piece of bony mat- ter. Dark solid specks are also seen in the spine, corresponding to the bodies of the vertebrae ; and even the rudiments of spinous processes are ob- served in the shape of minute dark points. In the hands and feet rings of bones are seen in the site of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones. All the joints consist of a semi-consistent jelly-like matter, liberally supplied by blood-vessels. At ten weeks the cylinders and rings are increased in length, and are observed to approach the jelly- like extremities, which are acquiring the consis- tence of cartilage, and when divided present irre- gular cavities. At the same time the parts form- ing the head are highly vascular; and between the membranes are deposited minute points of bony matter, proceeding in rays from a centre.

581 BONE. B. Bell Jun. describes a peculiar sinking or conden- sation of the cancellated texture of the neck of the thigh-bone, occurring chiefly in aged subjects. * The affected part of the bone is highly vascular. In the only instance of this in my possession, the head of the bone has lost its spherical shape, and is flattened down upon the neck not unlike the pileus of a mushroom. The most internal part of its cartilaginous covering presents a series of holes passing into the cancelli. The neck is about one-third of its usual length, so that the head of the bone is lower than the great trochan- ter. This change must have been effected by the medullary vessels of the head and neck of the bone. 8. Angiectasis.—The arterial system of bones is liable to a peculiar anormal developement, in which they become much enlarged, and forming a cyst in the substance of the bone, gradually effect its absorption. Cases of this description I have al- ready stated were observed by Pearson and Scar- pa. Recently similar cases have occurred to M Lallemand and M. Breschet. f 9. Eburneoid, or Ivory-lihe Induration—This, which consists in bone acquiring extraordinary hardness, density, and closeness, is occasionally seen in bony tvmiours, or exostosis, in bones which have been fractured, and sometimes in those of the scull, without evident morbid condition. In the case of Petit, however, an osseous tumour as * Essay on Interstitial Absorption of the thigh-bone, Ed. 1824. f Repertoire Gen. de Breschet, T. ii. part 2d. Paris, 1826.

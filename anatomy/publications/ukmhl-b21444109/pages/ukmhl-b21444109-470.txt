GENERAL ANATOMY. 448 tinction must be observed, at least in pathological anatomy, I shall not be liable to the charge of futile innovation, if I attempt to trace the distinc- tion in the following sketch. The different forms of tumour occurring in the brain may be referred to the following heads: a, the simple cerebral tumour; |3, the adenoid or fleshy tumour; y, strumous tumours, compre- hending tubercles and tubercular deposits ; the adipose, lardaceous, or wax-like degeneration, {ce- roma;) g, the cartilaginous tumour, (chondroma;) ^, calcareous or bony deposits; ri, encysted tumours, including a, the hydatid-cyst or vesicular tumour, h, the blood cyst, (h(ematoma,) c, the fungoid tu- mour ; and d, the melanotic cyst. Simple cerebral tumour, (Scleroma.) Of con- siderable induration of particular regions of the brain, I have already spoken. When the indu- rated portion is definite in limits, and the rest of the organ preserves its usual characters, these in- durated portions have been vaguely described un- der the general name of tumours. It is more correct, however, to regard them as portions of brain indurated to an unusual degree, and perhaps changed in intimate structure. As the simplest form of tumour incident to the brain, this claims the first place. The most authentic cases of this change have been recorded by Platerus, Meckel, Roederer, Perotti, and Greding. From the descriptions given by these authors, part of the cerebral sub- stance appears to acquire unusual firmness, and

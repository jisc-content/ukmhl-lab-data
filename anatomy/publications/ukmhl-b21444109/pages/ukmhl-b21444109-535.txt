The most frequent instances of vilcerative destruc- tion of this tissue are seen in destruction of the round ligament and part of the capsule in the coxo- femoral articulation, and in that of the crucial ligaments in the femoro-tibial articulation. y. Periostitis.â€”Periosteum is liable to inflam- mation either from injury, spontaneously, or from the operation of the syphilitic or the mercurial poison. In fractures of the extremities the pe- riosteum may be seen reddened, thickened, and depositing semifluid substance, which appears to coagulate and unite the broken or wounded por- tions. When it takes place spontaneously, it is said to depend on the strumous diathesis, of which it is believed to be an indication. The membrane becomes thick, painful, unusually vas- cular, and, unless the action subsides, or is con- trolled by art, semifluid lymph is effused be- neath it, and even bloody, sanious, purulent matter may be formed. If the inflammation be confined to one spot, the thickened membrane, with the lymphy induration beneath it, gives rise to the swelling termed node, (tiodus.) When sup- puration takes place, it is too often followed by ca- ries of the subjacent bone if of soft spongy texture, as in the sternum ; or death {necrosis) if in one of more compact structure, as in the scull. The distinction, however, is not invariably observed; for caries of the tihia or ulna is seen to follow K k

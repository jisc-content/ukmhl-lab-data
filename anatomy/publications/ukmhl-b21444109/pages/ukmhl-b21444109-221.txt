SYSTEM OF EXHALANTS. 199 the body,â€”the cutaneous and the mucous exha- lants. The second contain those exhalants which are employed in the formation of fluids, which, continuing a given time on various membranous surfaces, are believed to be finally taken again into the circulation by means of absorption. And the third class consists of the exhalants concerned in the process of depositing nutritious matter in the different tissues and organs of the human frame. This arrangement is more distinctly seen in the following table. ^ f 1. Exterior, opening on natural surfaces or f Cutaneous. >- I canals. - - - ( Mucous. S j f Serous. S -j 2.

Each organic tissue is in this system supposed to have its appropriate exhalant arteries, from which it derives the material requisite for its nutrition. It is undeniable that this arrangement is at once clear, and possesses a sort of interesting re- gularity, which Avould prompt the wish that the existence of these vessels was actually demonstra- ted with certainty. It is evident, however, that the regularity of arrangement is the only advan- tage which it possesses over the views of those authors, whose method and opinions Bichat pro- fessed not to follow. The existence of exhalants is just as little proved in the rigorous reasoning of Bichat as in the fanciful theories of Boerhaave, the generalizing conclusions of Haller, or the

GENERAL ANATOMY. 748 distinguished, therefore, by the terras common membrane of the hrain and proper membrane of the hrain. The arachnoid, again, is a pelhicid web common to the two cerebral membranes. The first of these, the common or hard cerebral membrane {meninx dura, dura mater), presents two surfaces, an outer or cranial, and an inner or cerebral. The outer surface is irregular, filamen- tous, and vascular; and the substance of which it consists is distinctly fibrous. The fibres, however, do not follow any uniform direction, but are inter- woven irregularly. Maceration causes this mem- brane to swell and become separated into fibrous threads. It is well known that it is liberally sup- plied with blood-vessels, and that it is coimected by these to the inner surface of the scull. No nerves or absorbents have been discovered in it. This outer or cranial surface of the dura mater is manifestly of the nature of periosteum. Its vessels may be traced into the inner table; it contributes to the formation of the cranial bones in the foetus; and various facts show that it con- tributes to their nutrition during life. The inner or cerebral surface of this membrane is very smooth, uniformly polished, and shining ; and when examined in water, it appears to be formed by a very thin, transparent membrane, through which the cranial or outer surface and the fibrous structure of the hard membrane may easily be recognized. This pellucid inner mem- brane, which is termed by Baillie the inner lamina.

593 FIBRO-CARTILAGE. Fibro-cartilages, which establish a connection be- tween bones susceptible of little individual motion, as the intervertebral bodies; or which unite bones intended to remain fixed, unless under very pecu- liar circumstances, as those which form the junc- tion of the pelvic bones. {Symphysis pubis, sacro- iliac syyichondrosis.) The peculiarities of these substances consist in their partaking in different proportions of the nature of cartilage and white fibrous tissue, and consequently, in possessing the toughness and re- sistance of the latter with the flexibility and elas- ticity of the former. The structure of the fibro- cartilaginous tissue is easily seen in the inter- vertebral bodies, or in the cartilages uniting the pelvic bones. In the former, white concentric lay- ers, consisting of circular fibres placed in juxta- position, constitute the outer part; while the in- terior contains a semifluid jelly. The concentric fibrous layers are cartilage in a fibrous shape. In the latter situation the fibrous structure is equally distinct; while the cartilaginous consistence shows the connection with that organic substance. A similar arrangement is remarked in the inter- articular cartilage of the temporo-maxillary articu- lation, and in the semilunar cartilages of the knee- joint. In all, the fibrous is said to predominate over the cartilaginous structure. Their physi- cal properties are distensibility with elasticity. Though they are at all times subjected to consider- able pressure, they speedily recover their former p p

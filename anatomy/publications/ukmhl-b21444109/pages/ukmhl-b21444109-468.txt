GENERAL ANATOMY. 446 sioned by the encephalic capillaries having their nutritive action so much injured by the inflam- matory process, that they cease to deposit healthy cerebral substance. The induration now described commences gene- rally in the base of the brain by the hijjpocampus major, (cornu ammonis) and thence extends to the neighbouring parts. If confined to the brain only, it causes, according to M. Pinel, mere fatuity, (dementia,) with more or less palsy. But if it af- fect the annular protuberance, the limbs, or the olivary bodies, or the chord itself, epilepsy, gene- ral palsy, and death by marasmus, are the usual consequences. b. The change which produces fatuity is the early stage of a more serious lesion of the cerebral substance, atrophic hardening, (I'endurcissement,) an extreme state of induration found in the brains of idiots. From that already described, it differs chiefly in degree. A portion of brain so changed becomes a compact inorganic looking mass, re- sembling in colour, consistence, and density, indu- rated egg or even cheese. The cerebral substance is depressed, shrunk, and condensed, and seems utterly void of vessels or capillaries. When ex- posed to the action of fire, instead of swelling up without odour, and leaving a brownish light re- sidue, it assumes a horny hardness, emits a strong heavy smell, and leaves a compact shining black- ish residue. This hardening affects the white

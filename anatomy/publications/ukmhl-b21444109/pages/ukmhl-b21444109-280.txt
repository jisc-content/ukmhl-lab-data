GENERAL ANATOMY. S58 perior extremity of this column superadded. The second division of the nervous system, with which alone we are at present concerned, is found in the form of long chords or threads mutually connec- ted, and running in various directions through the body in the mode of ramification. To these the name of nervous trunks or chords, or simply nerves, has been long applied. The structure of the nerves has been examined with different degrees of accuracy and minuteness by a great number of anatomists. The more ancient authors, who wrote at a period when observation was much corrupted by fancy, and most of those who give descriptions in general systems, may be without much injustice passed over in silence.

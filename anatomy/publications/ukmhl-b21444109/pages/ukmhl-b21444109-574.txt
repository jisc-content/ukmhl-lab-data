GENERAL ANATOMY. 552 precise idea of this process ; and while they admit it as a pathological fact, they have too often lost sight of it in one or more of the changes to which it gives rise. To Mr Howship we are indebted for the first attempt to determine with precision the anatomical characters and pathological nature of this process. It may at first sight seem doubtful whether genuine bone is susceptible of such a process as inflammation. For though a bone constituted as already described is doubtless an organized sub- stance, and therefore liable to the actions of or- ganized bodies, yet whether a particle of completed bone, as in the compact parts of the cylindrical bones, becomes itself the seat of inflammation, may seem questionable. The morbid process, how- ever, to which the actual bony particles may not be competent, the membranous covering and the vascular filamentous penetrating web, are unques- tionably powerful agents in effecting. In short, while bone as a secretion is almost passive in its morbid relations, we observe it obeying the slight- est influence of the periosteum and its vessels on the one hand, and those of its medullary system on the other. Having premised these remarks, it is to be ob- served that inflammation occurring in boue may assume various forms. 1. Adhesive Inflammation.—Of these the sim- plest is that which takes place in the process of union ^fter fractures,—the healthy ossific infiammationoi

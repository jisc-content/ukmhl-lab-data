DIVISION OF THE TEXTURES. 21 but that there is no tissue in the human body which might not be defined in the same manner. In the formation of any arrangement of the or- ganic tissues of which the human body consists, two extremes must be sedulously avoided. First, care should be taken not to diminish too much the number of individual or distinct tissues, and to avoid the useless and unnatural system of referring the several substances employed in the construction of the human body to a small number of general heads. This was the error of the ancient physio- logists, who, from a wish to simplify more than nature admitted, referred the various animal sub- stances to an elementary fibre or fibres, which they imagined formed the basis or ground-work of the whole animal organization. The second extreme which ought to be avoided in this matter is the practice of dividing the sub- stances of the animal body into a greater number of distinct kinds and species than is convenient or necessary. Very superficial inspection, indeed, shows that they are not the same either in anato- mical or physical characters, or in chemical com- position, and that the idea of considering one tis- sue as a modification of another, or one animal sub- stance as forming or generating another, is, if not unnatural and impossible, at least much more re- mote from the truth, than to consider them as ac- tually differing in kind, and possessing the proper- ties of a separate form of organized matter. This, therefore, though an evil in its way, is one of much

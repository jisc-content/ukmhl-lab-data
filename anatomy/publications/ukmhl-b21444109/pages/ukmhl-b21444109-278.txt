256 ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE. two circumstances almost all morbid actions which become the subject of pathological anatomy may be referred; under the two general divisions, 1st, of changes in organization; and, 2cl, changes in nutritious deposition, or intimate structure. It is unnecessary to render this division more complex, by admitting, as has been done by seve- ral pathological writers, a third head in the changes which take place in the process of secretion. That process is to be viewed in general, nay, in almost all circumstances, as a complementary effect of nutrition ; and the morbid changes which it occa- sionally imdergoes may, without violence, be re- ferred to one or other of the two foregoing heads. It is different, however, with a third form or source of disease. I allude to those errors in the formation and relative situation of parts, especial- ly the integrant parts of organs, which have been termed malformations. (Missbildungen.) These have been shown by Oken, Meckel, and others, to depend on the accidental interruption of the pro- cess of developement, and misapplication of the component parts of organs during the early stage of that process. In the subsequent chapters of this work, though it is unnecessary to abandon the ^simple arrange- ment hitherto observed, the morbid changes inci- dent to the several textures shall be enumerated in reference to the two first distinctions,â€”those in mi- nute organization and its products, and those in nutrition and intimate structure. The various forms of malformation constitute a distinct fami- ly by themselves.

GENEllAL ANATOMY. 1G8 grene, (necrosis, iistilago, mal dcsardens,) which is the most perfect specimen of tlie death of jjarts, it affects skin, ceUular membrane, muscle, tendon, ligament, artery, vein, periosteum, bone, and car- tilage indiscriminately and generally. Its anato- mical character consists in coagulation of the blood in the vessels, always the capillary, sometimes the larger branches. But whether this be the cause or the effect of the death of the parts is uncertain. A fact formerly mentioned regarding the influence of ossification of the arteries in producing gan- grene of the toes, feet, and legs in old persons would seem to show that it is the cause. The phenomena of the dry gangrene, or that produced by spurred rye and bad food, on the other hand, might favour the notion, that coagulation of blood is the effect. The gangrene produced by tight ligature, as in the case of tumours, may be refer- red to either head. 6. Fever. In this disease, whatever be its form, intei'mittent, remittent, or continued, the capillary vessels are the principal seat of disorder. Nor is the affection confined to the capillaries of one re- gion, of one organ, or of one tissue. The seat of fever is to be sought neither in the cai)illaries of the brain and spinal chord, nor in those of the lungs, nor in those of the alimentary canal; but it is diffused over the minute ramifying commimi- cations of the aortic and venous branches in what- ever part of the body those commimications are found. To establish the truth of this statement

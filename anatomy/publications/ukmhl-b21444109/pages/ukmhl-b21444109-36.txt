GENERAL ANATOMY, 16 of his General Anatomy, a work which, in ori- ginality of plan and general excellence of perfor- mance, notwithstanding occasional defects and er- rors, has not yet been surpassed. The arrangement, however, of Bichat has been found incorrect or inconvenient; and various al- terations or modifications of it have been proposed by subsequent authors.

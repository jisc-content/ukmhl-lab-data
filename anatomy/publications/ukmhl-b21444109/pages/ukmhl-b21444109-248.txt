GENERAL ANATOMY. 226 or ganglions. The lymphatics of the upper ex- tremity, after passing through the glands of the arm-pit, terminate in trunks, which open into the subclavio-jugular veins, one on each side of the neck. Those of the lower extremity, after pas- sing through the glands of the groin, proceed with the common iliac vein into the abdomen, where they unite with other lymphatics. The lymphatics of the trunk consist in like man- ner of two layers, a subcutaneous and deeper seated one, distributed in the chest between the muscles and pleura, and in the abdomen between the muscles and peritoneum. In the chest and belly, each organ possesses a superficial layer of lymphatics distributed over its surface, and jier- taining to its membi'anous envelope; the other ramifying through its substance, and pertaining to the peculiar tissue of the organ. This twofold arrangement is most easily seen in the lungs, the heart, the liver, spleen, and kidneys. In a similar manner are arranged the lympha- tics in the external parts of the scull, on the face,^ where they are very numerous, in the spaces be- tween the muscles, and on the neck, in which they pass through numerous glands. No lymphatics, however, have been found in the brain, the spi- nal chord, their membranous envelopes, the eye, or the ear. All the lymphatics hitherto known terminate in two principal trunks. One of these, termed from its site thoracic duct, (ductus thoracicus, die Milch-

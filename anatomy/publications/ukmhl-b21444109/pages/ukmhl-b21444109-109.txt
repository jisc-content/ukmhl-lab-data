AllTERY, ARTEllIAI. TISSUE. 89 lymph thus effused becomes penetrated with blood- vessels, and forms a new body adhering to the inner surface of the vessel. This is the origin of several of the granulated bodies, fungous growths, or vegetations, which have been described by Senac, Morgagni, Portal, BaiUie, Corvisart, Burns, and Bertin, as often found at the origin of the aorta, attached to the semilunar valves, or even in the mitral valve, the structure of which is not dissimilar. A red or crimson staining of the inner mem- brane, especially in the aorta, has been mentioned by Corvisart, Frank, Hodgson, and Laennec, and may be often seen in persons who have died with- out symptoms of pectoral or arterial disorder. Its nature is not well known. It seems to be the effect of a dying or tinging property of the blood, either during the last moments of life, or after the heart has ceased to beat. It must not be con- founded with inflammation or its effects. 2. C/irofiic Inflammation. In persons who have long laboured under the constitutional effects of the syphilitic poison, or who have been repeated- ly and permanently under the influence of mer- cury, especially in cold and variable climates, the arterial tissue is not unfrequently afi'ected by a slow insidious process of inflammation. It is not easy to determine to what extent this may affect the inner membrane exclusively; for probably both suffer at the same time, and from the same causes; but the effects of the process differ in the

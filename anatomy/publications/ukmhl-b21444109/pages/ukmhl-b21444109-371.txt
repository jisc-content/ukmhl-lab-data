The deep layers form in some parts immediate mutual communications, espe- cially in the posterior cornu; and at this point alone the inner layer of the beam descends directly on the fibres of the limb. In expansion, these ra- diating fibres receive between them white matter from the hemispherical circumference ; and in this manner form connections, as remarked by Reil, with the peripheral or convoluted part of the he- mispheres, and especially with those which form the Sylvian fissure.* This may be considered the second connection of the beam with the brain- limbs. The hinder part of the beam is something firm- er than the fore part reckoned towards the centre; a circumstance which depends on the closeness with which its fibres are here compacted in mass. After forming the elevated ridge which constitutes the hinder cross-bar of the vault, they plunge in- to the hemispheres in the form of thick bundles, which, running horizontally backwards over the posterior cornu, are expanded in the posterior parts of the hemispheres. The inner layer of these fibres, which falling on the outer wall of the cornu over the radiation of the limbs, covers it and part of the outer wall, is named by Reil the tapestry, or hanging, (die Tapete.) This may be viewed as a third point of junction be- tween the beam and the brain limbs.

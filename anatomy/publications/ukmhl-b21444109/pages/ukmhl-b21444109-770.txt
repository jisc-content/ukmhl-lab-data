GENERAI- ANATOMY, 746 the region containing the heart, but which extends no further. It embraces the origins of the large vessels above, adlieres to the margins of the ten- dinous centre below, and is on each side connected with the pleiira. When the pericardium is slit open, its inner surface has the appearance of a transparent or se- rous membrane, through which the fibres of the outer or capsular part may be seen, and which has the usual glistening aspect of such membranes. It is difficult, however, to insulate it from the out- er layer, unless by boiling, when it may be peeled off in minute shreds. Like the transparent membranes, this inner la}'"er has neither beginning nor end, neither ori- gin nor termination. After lining the inner sur- face of the proper capsule, it may be traced from the angle at which this capsule adheres to the large arteries and veins, over the auricles, and finally, over the outer surface of the ventricles to the apex of the heart. In this whole course, it preserves the characters' of a thin transparent membrane, with a free sur- face and an attached one. The free surface is perfectly smooth, glistening, and moistened with a watery fluid. The attached surface adheres, on the one hand, to the inner surface of the capsule, and on the other, to the outer surface of the heart, by means of fine filamentous tissue. Injection shows that the pericardium consists chiefly of minute arteries and veins. The sub-

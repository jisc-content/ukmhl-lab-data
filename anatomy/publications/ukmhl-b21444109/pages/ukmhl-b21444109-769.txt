SEROUS MEMBRANE. 745 the testicle,â€”a process which has been so well ex- plained by Albiniis, Haller, Wrisberg, and Lan- genbeck, is necessarily attended with a remarkable change in the arrangement of that portion of peri- tonaeum which the gland impels before it. The above description applies chiefly to the ge- neral characters and properties of serous mem- branes. I have yet, however, to advert to certain forms of this tissue, which, though similar in ge- neral characters, present too many peculiarities to be justly identified with them. The first which I notice as least different is the or capsule of the heart; the second is the arachnoid membrane, which shall be examined with the ce- rebral envelopes. The capsule of the heart (jiericardium) con- sists of two portions or layers, an outer or proper capsular, and an inner or lining division. The outer or proper capsular part of the pericardium possesses the characters of a fibrous membrane, of some density and considerable strength. When properly washed, its colour is gray or grayish- white, and it appears to consist of very minute fibrous threads, which are arranged without any definite order. These fibres are most distinct at its lower margin, where it is connected to the circum- ference of the tendinous part of the diaphragm. In the young subject it is generally thin and trans- lucent ; in adult age or advanced life it is thick- er and more opaque. This part of the pericar- dium is a mere investing membrane, which bounds

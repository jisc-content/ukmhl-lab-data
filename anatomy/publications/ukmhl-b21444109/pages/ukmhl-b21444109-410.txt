388 GENERAL ANATOMY. denly a part of the cerebral substance, and, pro-, ceeding rapidly to the suppurative stage, forms a distinct cerebral abscess. Cases of this descrip- tion were early noticed by BaUonius, Gontard, and more recently by an anonymous writer, * Mr Brodie, f Dr O'Brien, t Mr Parkinson, ยง and Dr Duncan Junior. || By Bonetus this affection of the cerebral sub- stance was believed to precede and to cause the discharge from the ear. Although this idea was refuted by Morgagni, who regards the cerebral abscess as consecutive to the ear-discharge, espe- cially its suppression, it has been revived by Mr Brodie, who seems to think the affection of the brain coeval at least with that of the ear. I shall afterwards show that the internal affection, to which Bonetus and Mr Brodie ascribe this cha- racter, and which they think causes the ear-dis- charge, is disease either of the tympanal cavity, or of the dura mater investing the temporal bone. The inflammation which terminates in abscess of the cerebral substance is the effect of inflamma- tion of the membranes, and in some instances of * Medical Commentaries, II. 180.

573 BONE. fungous exostosis consists of lobulated masses of soft, spongy, vascular substance like fat, brain, or clotted blood, which emits malignant fungi, and discharges blood-coloured serum. After some time it not only distends, separates, and destroys the bone, but it undergoes an alternate process of sloughing and hemorrhage. Though, in com- pliance with the views of Sir A. Cooper, I place it under this head, it is scarcely entitled to the character of enostosis or exostosis, but is manifest- ly of the nature of the encephaloid tumour. The cartilaginous, or genuine enostosis, consists of masses of firm chondrodesmoid structure, whit- ish-i'ed or graj^ producing by its enlargement pro- gressive separation and destruction of the bone, but not possessing the fungating or malignant tendency. * M. A. Severinus, Mery, and Mr J. Bell have described a variety of monstrous enlargement of the bones of the hand, which I think is to be viewed as belonging to the head of enostosis. Though they are termed tumours of the phalanges, it is impossible to doubt, from perusing the au- thentic description of Mery especially, that the disease consisted of inordinate enlargement of the ends or articular heads of the phalanges, f This enlargement was confined to the ends of the me- tacarpal and middle row.

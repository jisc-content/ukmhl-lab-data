255 ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE. Prochaska, who has investigated this subject with much attention, thinks he is justified in dividing all the substances of the animal frame into two,— those which may be injected, and those which can- not. In this manner he regards skin, especially its outer surface, muscle, various parts of the mucous membranes, thepia mater, the lungs, the muscular part of the heart, the spleen, the liver, kidneys, and other glands as very injectible; but tendon, ligament, cautilage, &c. as not injectible.* Without entering minutely into the merits of this distinction, or the inferences which Prochaska makes to flow from it, it is sufficient, so far as all useful knowledge is concerned, to infer, that blood-vessels are an essential constituent of every organic texture, however different; and if there be any other mat- ter inherent in such textures, it must be derived from these as a secretion. Muscle, brain, nerve, osseous matter, and cartilage are depositions or the product of nutritious secretion from the respective arteries of these organized substances. To apply these distinctions to pathological ana- tomy, therefore, two leading facts are presented as principles. The first of these is the arrangement of the vessels in the substance of the organic tex- tures ;—their organization. The second is the great result of organization, the principal duty per- formed by the vessels in each tissue ;—the forma- tion of each organic substance, or the process of nutrition.

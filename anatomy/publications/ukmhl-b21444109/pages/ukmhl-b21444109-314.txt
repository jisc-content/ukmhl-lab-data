From these symp- toms (Home,) the absence of pulsation and its si- tuation, no doubt could be entertained that it im- plicated the brachial nerve. The woman refused, however, to submit to have it removed ; and I have not since heard of her. The evidence of dissec- tion as to its precise nature is therefore still want- ing. It is not easy to determine which of these tu- mours are to be regarded as common, or proper to the nervous chord or the neurilematic tissue.

I then had occasion to remark, that there is sti'ong reason for thinking that this painful disease eon-

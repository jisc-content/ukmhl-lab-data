Only a serous membrane with its almost frictionless surface and its watery secretion could pos- sibly meet the requirements of the case. The details of structure of the tunica intima will be presented in connection with the description of the heart, blood-vessels, and lymphatics, respectively. 3. The Lining Membrane of Certain Cavities in Sustentacular Tissues. The most conspicuous illustration of this form of serous membrane is found in the internal ear. Around the greater part of the membranous labyrinth, which is the essential portion of the organ of hearing, and between it and the bone in which it is lodged, is a considerable space, lined with serous membrane and filled with a watery fluid, which is called perilymph. Another example is found between the back of the eyeball and the bed of fat upon which it reposes. It is called the capsule of Tenon, and is a shut sac, with a visceral layer upon the globe of the eye and a parietal layer attached to the postjacent adipose tissue. It permits free movements of the eye in the orbit with the least possible friction. In character and function it closely resembles the proper serous membranes. 4. The Lining Membrane of the Cavity of the Cerebro-spinal Axis. The brain and spinal cord are hollow organs. Their cavities are lined with a delicate membrane, serous in character, its epithelium being in embryonic life ciliated, and its secretion thin and watery. The membrane is known as the endyma {^^ ^Sixment^'') or ependynia. It will be described in the chapter on the Cerebro-spinal Axis. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. By certain authorities the synovial membranes are classed with the serous, and there are some good arguments in favor of this association. But, while these mem- branes have no communication with the surface, and have the same order of func- tion as the serous membranes, there are such differences as to justify a separation of the one from the other. The group of synovial membranes with which surgeons have most to do are not shut sacs, although each forms a part of the wall of a closed cavity; they have a different lining fi'om serous membranes ; their secretion is not serous ; and they are not associated with the viscera. Therefore, they are here treated by themselves. The synovial membranes form a part or the whole of the enclosure of certain cavities, which are associated Avith the osseous framework or the muscular system, or both ; and the service which they render is the lubrication of parts which glide upon each other. A synovial membrane is composed of fibrous tissue, having on its free surface an imperfect covering of cells (Fig. 72), and thus affording the great exception to the rule that free surfaces are completely clothed with cells. These cells are of no regular shape, are branched, and are gathered into little patches, which are scattered over the surface, leaving considerable areas ujion Avhich no cellular structure appears. The cells are often called epltheUoid, which means " like epithelium."

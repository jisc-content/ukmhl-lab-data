THE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 820 THE BULBO URETHRAL GLANDS. The bulbo-ui'ethral or suburethral glands, more commonly called the glands of Cowper (Fig. 887), are two firm, rounded, somewhat lobulated bodies, about the size of peas. They are situated between the two layers of the triangular ligament, one on either side of the membranous urethra, and immediately above the posterior extremity of the bulb. From the last they are separated by the inferior layer of the triangular ligament, and some fibres of the compressor urethrte muscle. Each of these bodies represents a compound racemose gland made up of several lobules, held together by fibrous tissue. The ducts of the lobules unite to form a single duct, which escapes from the gland at its anterior and superior aspect. The ducts from both glands pierce the triangular ligament, and con- verging, run forward beneath the mucous membrane for an inch or more, to open finally by minute orifices into the floor of the bulbous urethra. The acini of the glands are lined with pyramidal epithelium, the ducts by a finely granular epithelium disposed in two layers. The product of these glands is a viscid, transparent, albuminoid fluid, which is mixed with the seminal fluid at the moment of ejaculation. These are divided into two groups, according as they are closely related to the anal canal or to the genito-urinary organs. In the former set are the anal sphinc- ters, the levatores ani, and the coccygei; in the latter are the transversi perinei, the ischio-cavernosi, the bulbo-cavernosi, and the constrictor urethrse. All are in pairs, excepting the sphincters (including the constrictor), which are bilaterally symmetrical. About an inch in front of the anus four of these muscles—one behind, one in front, and one on each side—unite in a small, tendinous area, called the central point of the perineum.

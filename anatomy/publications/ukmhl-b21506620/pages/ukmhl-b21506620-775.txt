763 GJtOSS ANATOMY OF THE LUNGS. vessels, and other structures iu the mediastinal space. Each lung presents an outer surface, which is convex, and adapted to the inner surface of the chest-wall of one side ; an internal or mesial surface, which is irregularly concave and occu- pied by mediastinal organs; an under surface or base, very concave and fitting to the upper surtace of the diaphragm ; a summit or apex, which rises an inch above the level of the tirst rib ; a hind border, rounded, vertical, and adjusted to the Fig. 821.—Right lung, outer surface. (Testut.) Fig. 822.—Left lung, outer surface. (Testut.) long hollow made by the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae and the proximal portion of corresponding ribs ; a front border, thin, irregular, and slo])ing from above downward and outward to the level of the fifth or sixth rib ; and a laiver border, bevelled sharply at the expense of the lower surface, and marking the under limit of the outer surface. On the inner surface, three quarters way back from the front line, and about Fig. 823.-LUU-.S, dorsal view. (Testut.) equally distant from apex and base, is a vertical notch, the hilum, two inches long and an inch or more broad, which gives passage to the air-ducts, pulmonary artery and veins, bronchial artery and veins, lymph-vessels, and nerves, and affords lodgment to a considerable number f»f lymph-nodes. These different organs in the hilum are united into one large fagot, called the root of the lunr/. The inner surface of the left lung is much more deeply concaved than that of the right, on account of the greater encroaclmient of the heart upon the space at

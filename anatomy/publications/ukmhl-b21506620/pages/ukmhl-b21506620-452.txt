442 THE BLOOD-VASCULAB SYSTE3L circular amputations of the thigh. The femoral cau be ligated at any part of its course. To ligate the common femoral make an incision in a line which bisects Scarpa's triangle, passing from the middle of the base to the apex. Beginning at the inguinal (Poupart's) ligament and passing downward three inches, divide skin, superficial and deep fascia. The common femoral will be exposed, with the vein situated internally and in close contact, and with the anterior crural nerve exter- nally, and separated from it by a distance of a half inch. The femoral can be ligated at the apex of Scarpa's triangle by an incision along the inner border of the sartorius muscle in this position. The muscle Fig. 479—Horizontal section of the right thigh near the perineum—upper surface of the lower segment. (After Braune.) is drawn outward, the deep fascia divided, and the vessel is exposed. The vein is here posterior to the artery, and the internal saphenous nerve is to the outer side. The femoral can be ligated in Hunter's canal by an incision along the outer border of the sartorius in this position; the sartorius is drawn inward, the fibrous covering of the canal divided, and the artery exposed, with the vein behind or external, and the internal saphenous nerve superficial and external. The Branches of the femoral are the superficial epigastric, superficial external

399 THE ARTERIES. beneath the zygoma, on the surface of the masseter, and anastomoses with branches of the facial. The middle temporal branch perforates the temporal fascia, and sup- plies the temporal muscle, anastomosing with the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillary. The anterior auricular branch is distributed to the anterior sur- face of the external ear. The anterior temporal winds forward and upward over the frontal bone, and su})pli('S the scalp structures. In this position the artery is very superficially situated ; its pulsations can be readily felt, and often seen. The position of the artery is such tliat, in giving an antesthetic the ansesthetizer can from this vessel feel the conditi(jn of the pulse. The anterior temporal is the artery usually selected to perform the operation of arteriotomy. The posterior temporal passes backward and upward superficially in the scalp to the vertex of the skull, supplying the scalp over the sides of the vertex, and anastomosing with the occipital, the jjosterior auricular, and the vessel of the opposite side. The Internal Maxillary Artery (Figs. 449, 450) is one of the terminal divisions of the external carotid. Origin : from the external carotid a little below the condyle of the jaw. Course and termination: the artery is at first in the substance of the parotid gland, whence it passes inward and forward to the spheno-maxil- FiG. 449.â€”Internal maxillary artery. (Testut.) lary fossa. It is divided into three portions, a maxillary, a pterygoid, and a spheno-maxillary. The maxillary portion lies below the inferior border of the external pterygoid muscle; the pteri/c/oid portion lies on the anterior surface of the pterygoid muscle ; the spheno-maxillary portion rests on the superior maxillary bone, and in the spheno-maxillary fossa.

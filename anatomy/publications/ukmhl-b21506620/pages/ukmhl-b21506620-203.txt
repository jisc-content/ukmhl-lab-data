THE EXTERIOR OF THE SKULL. 193 vertically-placed structures : Mesially are the posterior nares, separated by the vomer, and bounded below by the horizontal plates of the palate-bones, laterally by the internal pterygoid plates, and above by the body of the sphenoid and the TEETH Fig. 221.â€”Base of the skull, viewed from below. (Testut.) alfe of the vomer. On each side is seen the pteryf/oul fosm, completed by the tuberosity of the palate-bone below, and lodging the internal pterygoid and tensor palati muscles. The latter muscle arises from the acaphoid fossa, a subdivision at the upper part of the pterygoid fossa. External to the pterygoid fossa is the zygomatic fossa, whose roof forms part of the base of the skull. The basilar process of the occipital bone and a small part of the body of the sphenoid occupy the median, portion of the middle division, Avhile lafrra/Ii/ are the petrosals and a small portion of the great wings of the sphenoid, of the squamosals, and of the occipital bone. In the median line we notice the phnryn- geal tubercle and the front margin of the foramen magnvm, termed the hasion. Laterally, in a nearly sagittal line, we notice from before backward the foramen ovale, the foramen sjyinosum, the opening of the bony and the groove for the cartilaginous Eustachian canal, the entrance of the carotid canal, and the jugular fossa and foramen. Internal to the latter is the anterior condylar foramen, and externally the stylo-mastoid. foramen. Between the extremities of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and of the basilar process of the occipital and the sphenoid we notice the foramen lacerum medium, filled by fibro-cartilage in 13

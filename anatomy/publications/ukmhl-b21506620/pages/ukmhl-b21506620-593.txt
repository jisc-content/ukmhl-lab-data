((') The Lingua/ (wrongly called the gustatory) Nerve (Figs. 643, 644) lies at first under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, in front of and a little deeper than the inferior dental nerve, to which it is connected by a short branch. Here, also, it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani nerve from the facial. It runs downward and forward on the internal pterygoid muscle and mandibular attachment of the superior constrictor of the pharynx, and reaches the inner side of the lower jaw, close under the last molar tooth, where it lies immediately under the mucous membrane, and may be readily reached by the surgeon, or injured in cai'eless dentistry. It then lies between the hyoglossus and mylohyoid muscles above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, and crosses Wharton's duct obliquely as it bends upward toward the tip of the tongue.

It distributes twigs to the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth between the tongue and the gums, a branch to the sublingual gland (from the chorda tympani nerve), and ends by breaking up into fibres for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, supplying cliicfly the fungiform and filiform ])apilhe. The Submandibular (Submaxillary) Ganglion (Fig. 643).—In a small triangular space under cover of the mylohyoid muscle, having the lingual nerve above, Whar- ton's duct below, and the sulmiaxillary gland behind, lies a reddish body about the size of a pin-head, the subiiutuiJlhidar (.snbinriri/lari/) (/anr/Uon. Its roots are repre- sented by one branch (or several) running downward and forward to it from the

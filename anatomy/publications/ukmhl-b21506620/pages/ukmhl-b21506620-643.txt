Branches.—The articular branches, usually three in number, accompany the superior and inferior internal articular, and azygos articu- lar arteries to the knee-joint. The upper is frequently absent. The muscular branches are distributed to the gastroc- nemius (1. 2. s.), plantaris (4. 5. 1, 1. s.), soleus (5. 1, 1. 2. s.), and popliteus (4. 5. 1, 1. s.). Of these the nerve to the popliteus is given oflP under the gastrocnemius and descends on the outer side of the popliteal vessels to reach the lower border of its mus- cle. It winds beneath it and supplies the muscle on its anterior surface, giving also a branch to the tibia accom- panying its medullary artery, one to the interosseous mem- brane and inferior tibiofibular joint, and another to the superior tibiofibular articula- tion. The cutaneous branch (ramus conimunicans til)ialis vel poplitei) descends along the middle of the leg in the groove between the heads of the gastrocnemius, and pierces the deep fascia al)out half way down, to be joined by a similar branch from the pe- roneal nerve (ramus coni- municans peronei). Together they form the short or exter- nal saphenous nerve, which now accompanies the short saphenous vein beneath the external malleolus to the outer side of the foot, where it supplies the outer side of the foot and little toe, communicating with the musculocutaneous. It distributes branches to the skin on the back of the leg, external calcanean branches to the outer side of the heel, and articular branches to the ankle and astragalo-calcanean joints.

At the lower border of the popliteus muscle the popliteal nerve is called the posterior tibial. It passes down the middle of the leg on the deep muscles, and beneath the deep transverse sheet of fascia. The posterior tiiiial artery is at first on the outer side of the nerve, but, after giving off the peroneal artery, it crosses abruptly a little inwaixl l)eneath the nerve, and then descends on its inner side.

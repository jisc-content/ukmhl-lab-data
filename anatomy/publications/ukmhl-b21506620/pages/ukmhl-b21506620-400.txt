Variations.—The right common carotid sometimes springs directly from the arch of the aorta ; sometimes the left common carotid springs from a left brachio- cephalic artery ; the common carotid is sometimes absent, the internal and external carotids springing directly from the arch of the aorta or from a brachio-cephalic artery. In some cases it divides above or below the usual point, low down in the neck or as high as or higher than the hyoid bone. Surgical Anatomy (Fig. 442).—The common carotid can be ligated in any part of its course ; the best point to select is about the level of the cricoid cartilage and above the omo-hyoid muscle, because here the vessel is more accessible than in the lower part of its course. To expose the vessel in the upper part of its course an incision three inches in length is made along the inner border of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, the centre of the incision being opposite the cricoid cartilage. The incision divides the skin, superficial fascia, platysma myoid, and the anterior layer of the deep fascia ; the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is drawn to the outer side. The sterno-mastoid artery is usually divided, but this is of no

663 THE NOSE. By W. KEILLER. THE nose is the organ of the sense of smell. It forms on the face a prominence partly bony, partly cartilaginous. Its I'oot springs from the iiaso-frontal groove, except in the Grecian tyjie, where the dorsimi of the nose is in a straight line with the forehead. The mesial ritlge is called the (Jorsmn, of which the upper bony segment forms the bridge. It ends below in the tijj, which is continuous with the horizontal free edge of the septum, called the eolumna nasi. The sides of the nose form an angle with the face, which increases as it descends (the naso- facial angle). The rounded, lateral boundary of the nostril is called the ala. The Nasal Cavity consists of tw o fosscv, separated from each other by a mesial sejitum. Thvy open anteriorly by the two nostrils ov anterior varcs, and posteriorly by the posterior nares or choaiuc (" funnels") into the u])per part of the pharynx. The anterior nares are guarded by hairs, vibrissa', which spring from their inner surface. Each expands into a smooth-walled, front chandjcr called the vestibule, the rest of the nasal cavity being divisible into three channels called meatuses. The width of the nostrils bears in different races a very varying relation to its length measured vertically. The skin of the nose is fine and movable over the b<my part, thick, adherent, and closely studded with large sebaceous glands over the tip and alae.

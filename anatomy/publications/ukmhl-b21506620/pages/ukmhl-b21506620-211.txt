THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE SKULL. 201 Furthermore, t!ie shape of the transverse arch of the cranium, the fusion or complexity of the sutures, the degree of projection of tlie jaws (indicating an approach to, or a removal from, the animal type), the relation between the height and the width of the anterior nasal aperture (or nasal index), and of the base of the orbits (or orbital index), are subject to variation among different races. The facial angle (of Cloquet), which helps to determine the relative development of the face and the frontal part of the cranium, is that formed by two lines meeting in the median line at the alveolar border of the maxilla, and drawn, one from the most ])rominent median frontal point and the other from the middle of the external auditory meatus. Several other measurements for more accurate determination of the form of the cranium are in use, for which Broca's or other works on craniology should be consulted. The situation and direction of the fc/ramen magnum differ greatly in man and the lower animals, and to some extent among the different races of man. In quadrupeds it is placed dorsally and looks backward, in man at or near the centre of the base, and looks downward and slightly forward in the European, downward and slightly backward in the negro ; while in the anthropoid apes it is intermediate in position and direction as compared with that in man and the quadrupeds. The most frequent irregukirity of form is want of symmetry, which is usually present to a slight degree. Asymmetiy usually depends upon premature synos- tosis or closure of one or more sutures, preventing growth in a direction at I'ight angles to the line of that suture, and tending to increase the growth in other directions. Artificial pressure applied in early life may also cause irregularity of form, as seen in the case of the Flat-headed Indians,

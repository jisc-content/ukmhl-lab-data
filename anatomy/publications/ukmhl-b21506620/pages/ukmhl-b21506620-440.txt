THE BLOOD-VASCULAB SYSTEM. 430 Surgical Anatomy.—The position of the mesenteric branches in the mesentery should be carefully noted in operations for the removal of sections of the intes- tines. Although the branches anastomose freely in the mesentery, when they reach the intestine and are distributed to it, they Avind between its walls at right angles to its long axis, and do not anastomose freely with each other; and, as a result of this fact, a separation of the mesentery for any considerable extent from the intestine cuts off the blood supply of the gut, and gangrene results. The Branclies of the superior mesenteric are the inferior pancreatico-duo- deualis, the intestinal and the colic arteries. The inferior jxmcreatico-duodenalis runs between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, supplying those struct- vires, and anastomosing with the pancreatico-duodenalis suj^erior. The mtestinal branches supply all of the small intestines except the duodenum. The colic branches are divided into the ileo-colic, the colica dextra or right colic, and the colica media or middle colic. The ileo-colic supplies the csecum, the ileum adjoin- ing it, and the appendix. The 7'ight colic supplies the ascending colon ; the 7nid- dle colic, the transverse colon, and anastomoses Avith the left colic. Fig. 473.—Inferior mesenteric artery. (Testut.) The Inferior Mesenteric (Fig. 473).—The inferior mesenteric arises about an inch and a half above the termination of the aorta. It passes between the layers of the meso-colon and supplies the left portion of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. Variations.—The inferior mesenteric is occasionally absent, its place being supplied by branches from the superior mesenteric.

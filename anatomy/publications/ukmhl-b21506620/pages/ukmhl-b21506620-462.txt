452 THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. the leg. It winds upward in the substance of the tibialis anterior to the patella, and anastomoses with the arteries forming the patellar anastomosis. Muscular branches are given otf to the muscles on the anterior surface of the leg. The maUeolar arteries are small branches given otf from the lower portion of the ante- rior tibial. The external malleolar supplies the tissues over the outer ankle, the internal malleolar those over the inner ankle. The Dorsalis Pedis (Fig. 489).—The dorsalis pedis is the continuation of the anterior tibial. It begins at the bend of the ankle, and continues downward and forward to the base of the first interosseous space, where it divides into the dor- FiG. 488.—Horizontal section at middle of right leg—upper surface of lower segment. (After Braune.) salis hallucis and the communicating or plantar digital branch. The vessel is superficial in position ; it is accompanied by the anterior tibial nerve and vense comites; it is external to the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis. Variations.—The dorsalis pedis varies in size greatly; when large, it assists materially the plantar arteries in supjjlying the sole of the foot; when small, the plantar arteries may furnish a large part of the supply for the dorsum. Surgical Anatomy.—The dorsalis pedis can be exposed by an incision along the outer side of the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis. It is accompanied by the anterior tibial nerve and by venag comites. The Branches of the dorsalis pedis are the tarsal, metatarsal, dorsalis hallucis, and communicating or plantar digital. The tarsal artery winds outward over the

705 THE MOUTH. Method of Displacement of Temporary Teeth.—The temporary teeth are repUieed by the permanent in the following manner : the tooth which is to succeed the deciduous tooth is pushed ujjward by the continual growth of the dentine of its fang. Its enamel is crowded against the root of the milk-tooth, cuts off its nutri- tion, and, by the incessant pressure of its dense substance upon the less hard materials composing the root of the tooth above, causes the latter to dwindle away, particle by particle, the molecules disappearing by absorption, until all of UPPER MOLARS OF RIGHT SIDE FRONT SURFACE GRINDING SURFACE GRINDING SURFACE FRONT SURFACE LOWER MOLARS OF RIGHT SIDE Fig. 7."i3.—Till' niulur tuutli—thfir Irunt and grinding surfaces. (Testut.) the root has vanished, and the only support of the crown is that afforded by the adhesion of the gum to the neck. Then the crown is knocked off by some slight force, and in its place appears that of its permanent successor. When the per- manent tooth is not aimed accurately at the root of the temporary, but shoots by it, the latter remains undisturl)e(l.

A portion of the alveolar process grows around its base, and furnishes a snug socket for it ; but, in spite of its density and the solidity of its im])lantation, it is com- parable with other jiapillse, such as that of a hair-follicle. The changes in the epithelium of the hair-])apilla ai-e unlike those which take place in that of the tooth-])apilla, and, consequently, the result is very different, although in both cases the modifieation is in the direction of hardening ; but, philosophically con- 45

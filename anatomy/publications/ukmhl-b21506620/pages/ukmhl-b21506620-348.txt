THE MUSCLES. 338 Thyro-hyoideus (Fig. 403).—" The tliyroid-cartilage-liyoid-bone muscle." Situation, in the front of the neck. Origin, the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Direction, upward. Insertion, the body and great cornu of the hyoid. Action, depression of the hyoid; by reversed action, elevation of the thyroid cartilage. Nerve, the hypoglossal. ' Digastricus (Figs. 402, 40*3).—" The two-bellied muscle." Situation, the uppermost part of the side of the neck. Origin, the digastric fossa of the tem- poral. Direction, forward, inward, and downward, then forward, downward, and slightly inward. Insertion, the mandible, at its lower border near the symphysis. The tendon between the bellies is held down to the hyoid bone by a fibrous loop and the stylo-hyoid muscle, and the change in direction is effected at this point. Fig. 401.—Superficial muscles of side of neck. (Testut.) Action, elevation of the hyoid, if the mandible is fixed ; depression of the mandi- ble, if the hyoid is fixed. Nerves, the facial for the hind belly, the inferior maxil- lary division of the trifacial for the front belly. Stylo-hyoideus (Fig. 402).—" The styloid-process-liyoid-bone muscle." Situa- tion, in the uppermost part of the side of the neck, along tlic upper border of the hind belly of the digastricus. Origin, the root of the styloid process of the tem- poral. Direction, down- and forward. Insertion, the hyoid. Near its insertion it is perforated by the digastricus. Action : it lifts the hyoid, and pulls it back- ward and sidewise. Nerve, the facial. Mylo-hyoideus (Fig. 402).—" The molar-teeth-hyoid-bone muscle," so-called

FLEXOR SUBLIMIS DIGITORUM. 273 Ahductors. *Interossei dorsales. *Abductor minimi digiti. Adductors. *Interossei palmares. Of the five of these muscles located mainly in the forearm two arise from the humerus, one from the humerus, radius, and ulna, and two from the ulna only. Every one in the group is inserted into one or more of the fingers, excepting the flexor of the fifth metacarpal bone, which is admitted to this company of finger flexors on account of the similarity of its action. Flexor Sublirais Digi- torum (Figs. 303-305).— " The superficial flexor of the digits "—meaning the four fingers as distinguish- ed from the thumb. Sijno- nym, flexor perforatus, "the perforated flexor" 4] Fig. 305 —Tendon of flexor sublimis perforated by tendon of flexor profundus. (Testut.) —from the openings through which the ten- dons of the deej) flexor pass. Situation, in the front of the forearm and hand, deeper than the flexors of the Avhole hand, but superficial to the other flexors. Origin, first head : the inner condyle of the humerus ; second head : the inner border of the eoronoid process of the ulna ; third head : the oblique line and part of the anterior border of the radius. Direction, downward to all of the ,, by four tendons, each to the sides of a second plialanx. As the tendons pass thi'ough the annular ligament, those for the middle and ring-fingers are side by side in front, the others behind them. Each tendon IS Fig. 303.—Flexor sublimis digi- torum of right side. (Testut.) Fig. 304.—Flexor sublimis digitorum of right side: outline and attachment- areas. (F. H. G.) digits but the thumbs.

THE SYMPA THETIC NEB VES. 645 side of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, between it and the diaphragm, and from it the cord descends into the abdomen through the crus of the diaphragm to unite the last thoracic to the first lumbar ganglion. Rami Communicantes.—Two rami communicantes, sometimes called the exter- nal branches, unite each ganglion to its corresponding spinal nerve. Of these one is usually white, the other gray. RENAL PLEXUS Fig. 693,—Plan of right sympathetic cord and splanchnic nerves. (Testut.) The rami efferentes, called the internal branches, are divisible into an upper and a lower series. The upper series proceeds from the upper four or five ganglia to the aorta, forming with branches from the splanchnic the thoracic aortic plexus. Other slender filaments supplv the vertebrae and ligaments, and the second, third, and fourth ganglia send branches to the posterior pulmonary plexus. The lo-wer series includes the internal branches of the lower six or seven ganglia. They form the great, small, and least s])lanchnic nerves. The great splanchnic (visceral) nerve is formed by the convergence on the sides of the vertebrse of the internal branches of the fifth or sixth to the ninth or tenth ganglia inclusive. These branches and the resulting trunk distribute fila-

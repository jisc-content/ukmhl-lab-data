THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 372 the right auricle ; below by the antero-inferior border, which separates it from the inferior surface, and is so sharp that it is called margo acutus ; on tlie left by the left border, on the marked convexity of the left ventricle; and above by the line of junction of the pulmonary artery with the heart, and by the upper margin of the appendixes. The Dorsal Surface (Fig. 431) is irregularly convex, looks backward, and pre- sents the greater part of the left auricle. Above are the horizontally directed primary divisions of the pulmonary artery, the right and left pulmonary arteries ; at the right the posterior interauricular groove; below, the auriculo-ventricular Fig. 430.â€”Front view of the heart. The auriculo-ventricular and anterior interventricular grooves and the vessels in them are not labelled, but cannot be mistaken. (From the His cast. F. H. G.) groove ; at the left a line leading downward from the left pulmonary veins, commonly marked by the oblique vein (of Marshall), which ends below in the coronary sinus. The Right Surface is convex, quadrilateral, and exhibits nearly all of the right auricle which is not included in the ventral surface. At the postero-inferior angle the vena cava inferior enters, and tlie vena cava su^ierior is seen above. Behind is the posterior interauricular groove ; below, the auriculo-ventricular groove; and in front is the right border, already mentioned. The Left Surface is unevenly convex and somewhat triangular. It jiresents above and behind a part of the left auricle, and in front of this a portion of its appendix; below, the left ventricle, tapering to the apex, and showing in the

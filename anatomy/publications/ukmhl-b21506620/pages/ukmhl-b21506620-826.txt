THE ORGANS OF OENEBATION. 814 the albuginea, numerous fibro-muscular lamellated or filamentous tmbeeulce are derived. These become smaller near the central axis of the body, and are stronger behind, in the vicinity of the crura, than in front. Crossing each other in divers directions, the trabeculse divide the cylindrical cavity of the albuginea into an immense number of spaces, called areola'. The latter communicate freely with each other, and with those of the opposite body through the fissures in the sep- tum. They are lined by epithelial cells, resembling those found in the smallest arterial branches, and, therefore, represent widely dilated capillaries. At several points in their walls these spaces communicate with the arteries; they also give origin to the veins. The Corpus Spongiosum (Fig. 881) is traversed throughout its whole extent by the urethra. Its posterior extremity, somewhat dilated, is called the bulb, its anterior extremity, much dilated, makes up the glans, while tlie intervening por- tion is known as the body. The bulb (Fig. 880) is pear-shaped, about one and a half inches in length, and three-quarters of an inch in diameter at its widest part. It is larger than the body, and contains the bulbous ])ortion of the urethra, which is here surrounded by a greater amount of erectile tissue than elsewhere. Its posterior extremity lies about half an inch in front of the anus. Tapering anteriorly, it soon gains the inferior groove, formed by the junction of the corpora cavernosa, and merges into the body. The superior surface of the bulb rests against the inferior layer of the triangular ligament from which it receives an investment; its inferior surface is covered by the bulbo-cavernosi (acceleratores urinse) muscles. These muscles, two in number, arise from a median raphe on the under surface of the bulb. Diverging they encircle the latter and meet on its dorsal surface. A few of their most anterior fibres are sometimes inserted into the sides of the cor- pora cavernosa, or into the fascial sheath of the penis, in which case they com- press during erection the dorsal vein. The urethra does not occupy the central axis of the bulb, but lies nearer to its superior surface. The body is cylindrical or slightly tapering. It occupies the inferior groove formed by the junction of the cavernous bodies, and is tunnelled along its centre by the urethra.

The glans (Figs. 882-884) forms the anterior extremity of the penis. It is conoidal in outline and presents at its summit a vertical fissure, the meatus urina- rius exteryius, the anterior opening of the urethra. Its base, directed backward,

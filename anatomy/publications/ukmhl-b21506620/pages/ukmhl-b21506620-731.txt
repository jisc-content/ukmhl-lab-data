Having now considered the features common to the whole of tlie small intes- tine, we will study each portion of it in detail. THE DUODENUM. The duodenum (Fig. 773) differs from the jejuno-ileum in many respects. It is much wider, thicker in wall, more deejily situated, more complex in structure, contains certain glands peculiar to it, and is the part into which the ducts from the liver and pancreas discharge ; but it is much shorter, far less mobile, has only a scanty serous covering, and has none of the aggregated lymph-nodules. Its length is ten inches or less, its width two inches or less. It extends in a tortuous course from the pyloric opening to the point where the mesentery first embraces the gut, that is, at the left side of the second lumbar vertebra. It is conveniently divided into four portions, of which the first, about two inches long, runs back, up, and to the right under the quadrate lobe of the liver to the neck of the gall- bladder ; the second descends for alxmt three inches along tlie right edge of the head of the pancreas, to the level of the lower border of the third lumbar ver- tebra ; the third passes to the left horizontally two inches and a half, which brings it to the middle of the vertebral column, where it is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels; and the fourth ascends on the left of the column and ends in the jejuno-ileum, which descends from the line of junction very abruptly. Thus, the duodenum, after describing an irregular curve, suggestive of an imperfect circle, almost returns to its starting-point. Its serous coat is incomplete and irregularly applied. The first part is covered like the stomach ; the second is clothed in front; the third above, below, 46

256 THE MUSCLES. tebral border of the scapula, between the root of the spine and the lower angle. Action : it draws the scapula up- and inward. Nerve, the fifth cervical. Serratus Magnus (Fig. 268).—" The great saAV-toothed muscle." Synonym, serratus anterior. Situation, on the upper two-thirds of the side of the chest.

(Modified from Testut.) several inches from their front ends. Direction, up- and backward. Insertion, the front of the vertebral border of the scapula, and the surfaces at the upper and loAver angles. The first digitation, Avhich comes from the second, as well as from the first rib, runs to the surface at the upper angle ; the second and third digitations connect the corresponding ribs with the vertebral border from near the upper to near the lower angle ; the rest of the slips converge to the surface at the lower angle. Action : it draws the shoulder forward, as in pushing; the lower segment rotates the apex of the scapula upward. Nerre, the posterior thoracic. The lower five points of origin interlock with similar slips of the obliquus externus abdominis. Pectoralis Minor (Fig. 269, 270).—"The smaller breast-muscle." Situation, in the front of the chest.

Then, the occupation by the muscle of each successive portion of the great triangular sjjace included by it and the two bones ^v'hen in flexion would be an intolerable interference witli the usefulness of the limb, practically reducing the carrying })ower of the front of the forearm to Fig. 260.—Diagram showing the mechanical Fig. 261.—Diagram showing tlie effect of attaching a disadvantage of the points of attachment of limb-muscle at points of the greatest mechanical advan- many muscles. (F. H. G.) tage. (F. H. O.) nothing. There Avould also be a loss of a great deal of the important liga- mentous Avork of the muscles by their removal from close contact with the joints during their most pronounced activity. Thus it will be seen that the condition which exists, while extremely costly in the matter of muscular expenditure, is attended with advantages which are more than compensatory. Change in Direction of Muscular Force.—Tendons are often made to pass around jirominences and through loops, the force originating in the muscle, thus exjieriencing a change of direction, as in the case of a rope which runs from an engine through a pulley to an object which is to be hoisted. The contractile force of such a muscle is applied in line with the portion of its tendon lying between the last angle which it makes and the point of its attachment to the object to be moved. On account of tlie lubrication of the tendon by synovia, which is always present in such cases, no appreciable loss of power is experienced by the change of direction.

THE NER VES. 604 Superficial Branches (Fig. 645).—Those are ascending, transverse, and descending. ASCENDING BRANCHES. 1. The Small Occipital Nerve is derived from the second cervical nerve. It passes backward under the sternomastoid muscle to its dorsal border, then upward along that border, dividing at about the level of the mastoid process into an auricular branch to the skin of the dorsal and upper part of the pinna, a mastoid branch to the skin over the mastoid region, and an occipital branch to the occipital area. It communicates with the great auricular and great occipital nerves. Fig. 656.—Plan of cervical plexus. 2. The Great Auricular Nerve springs by two roots from the second and third cervical nerves. Reaching the dorsal border of the sternomastoid, it crosses it diagonally in running upAvard to the back of the auricle. It supplies a small mastoid branch to join the mastoid branches of the small occipital nerve, numer- ous large auricular branches to tlie back of the pinna in its lower two thirds, one or two of these piercing the cartilage to the front of the lobule and helix ; and a

795 THE SPLEEN. are occupied by the spleen-pulp, which is substantially blood, thickened by the addition of great numbers of leucocytes, among which are certain large cor- puscles, called splenic c-ells. The arrangement of the blood-vessels is extraordinary, and altogether peculiar to this organ. The splenic artery, which, judged by the standard of the arteries of other organs, is relativ'ely very large, runs in the lieno-renal ligament, and divides into five or six branches before entering the organ. Rapidly breaking up into smaller vessels, when the minute arteriole stage is reached, which is generally succeeded by the stage of capillaries, the vessels abruptly terminate, and the blood is poured into the wall-less spaces of the spleen-pulp, from which it is collected by venules. The Malpighian corpuscles are factories for leucocytes, and the arterial blood courses among the latter, its flow being impeded bv their great number and by the filamentous framework of the pulp-spaces. The blood in the splenic vein is remarkably rich in leucocytes. It is thought that one func- tion of the spleen is the disintegration of worn-out colored corpuscles of the blood, as the pulp contains many fragments of these cells. The Ij/mphrdics run in the tunica pro]iria, the trabeculfe, and the walls and sheaths of the vessels. They discharge into the splenic nodes, from which the lymph passes to the coeliac nodes. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The structure of the spleen is in some respects very similar to that of the lymph-nodes. The adenoid reticular tissue, the accumulations of lymph-cells, the great relative size in children, the atrophy which occurs in old ageâ€”all suggest an immense community of lymph-nodes, especially modified by a peculiar l)l()od-supply. Not very infrequently accessory spleens (lienculi) are found. They are globular and small, but otherwise look like the principal spleen, near which they are situated.

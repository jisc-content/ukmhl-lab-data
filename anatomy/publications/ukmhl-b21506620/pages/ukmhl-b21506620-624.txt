614 THE NERVES. 10. The Musculo-spiral Nerve. The musculo-spiral nerve (6. 7. 8. c.) (Figs. 664, 659, 662, 666, 667) is the ter- minal and largest branch of the posterior cord. Placed at first behind the third part of the axillary artery and upper part of the brachial, it soon leaves the latter vessel, and, accompanied by the superior profunda artery, pierces the internal ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS Fig. 663.â€”Deep palmar nerves. (Testut.) intermuscular septum, winds obliquely round the humerus in the spiral groove between the triceps and the bone, and reaching the external intermuscular septum, pierces it to gain the interval between the brachialis anterior and brachio-radialis, where it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves. Before its final division it gives off" an internal and an external cutaneous, and muscular branches to the triceps, anconeus, brachialis anterior (6. c), brachio-radialis (6. c), and extensor carpi radiahs longus (6. 7. c). Of the muscular branches those to the last three muscles are given off between the brachio-radialis and brachialis

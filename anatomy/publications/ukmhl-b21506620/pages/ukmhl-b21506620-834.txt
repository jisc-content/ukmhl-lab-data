822 THE ORGANS OF GENERATION. Constrictor Urethrse, also named eomjyressor urethrce, is enclosed between the two layers of the triangular ligament, and includes the membranous portion of the urethra, for which it acts as a sphincter. It is sometimes called the deep transverse muscle, because it extends across from side to side between the ischio- pubic rami. Part of it goes iu front and part behind the urethra. It squeezes the membranous urethra, and thus expels its contents. The dorsal nerve of the penis supplies it. THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The female generative organs arc divided into an interval and an external group. The former are contained within the pelvis and comprise the following structures : (1) the ovaries, two glandular organs devoted to the production of the ova; (2) the Fallopian tubes, canals through which the (tva reach the uterine cavity ; (3) the uterus, a single, median, hollow organ, which receives the fecun- dated ovum, provides it Avith nutrition, and expels it at maturity ; (4) the vagina, a canal by means of which the uterine cavity communicates with the external surface of the body. The external organs, grouped under the common term of tndva or pudendum, include the vulval canal and certain surrounding and contiguous structures. Fig. 890â€”Female pelvic viscera, from above.

They are firm, fibrous, ovoid bodies, situated in the retro-uterine

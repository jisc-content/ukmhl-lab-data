THE ORGANS OF THE SPECIAL SENSES. 688 processes from the cells of the inner nuclear layer. In the inner molecular layer the processes from the opposite ends of the same cells connect similai'ly with those from the ganglionic cells. These being in direct continuity with the fibres of the optic nerve, are thus connected with cells of the visual centres in the brain. 5. The internal and external limiting membranes mark the inner and outer limits of the sustentacular fibres. They are not separate or independent struct- ures, and the external, at least, is more imaginary than real as a membrane. The internal membrane is formed by contact of the expanded bases of the fibres of Miiller. 6. All the layers become extremely thin over the fovea centralis, both the CHOROID _ ~ ING LAYER VITREOUS Fig. 737.â€”Section of retina, showing its layers. The fibres of Miiller are in red. Diagrammatic. (Schultze.) layer of nerve-fibres on the inside and the rods on the outside being completely wanting. Around the border of the fovea they rapidly thicken, however, and over the rest of the macula lutea are thicker than anywhere else in the retina. At the ora serrata all the layers disappear abruptly, and only the layer of colum- nar epithelium before referred to takes their place in the pars ciliaris retinfe.

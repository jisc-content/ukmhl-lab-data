380 THE BLOOD-VASCULAB SYSTEM. Fig. 439.â€”The pulmonary artery. The front part of the right lung has been removed, and the pulmonary vessels and the bronchial tubes are thus exposed. (Testut.) In front. Sternum and pericardium. To the left. Pericardium. Pulmonary Left pleura. Artery. Left auricle. Left coronary artery. Behind. Arch of aorta and left auricle. Its branches are the right and left pulmonary. The right indmonary artery passes beneath the aortic arch to the right lung, breaks up into three sets of branches supplying the upper, the middle, and the inferior lobes. The left pulraonary o,rtery passes in front of the descending aorta to the left lung, and breaks up into two sets of branches supplying the upper and lower lobes. It is to be remembered that the pulmonary arteries carry venous blood to the lobules of the lungs, in which it experiences the changes produced by the func- tion of respiration, the structure of the lungs being supplied with arterial blood by the bronchial arteries, branches of the descending aorta. The branches of the pulmonary arteries do not anastomose with each other : they are terminal arteries. Passing from the pulmonary artery to the arch of the aorta is a fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus arteriosus, a vessel, which in the foetal circulation carries the blood sent through the pulmonary artery into the aorta. After birth this soon disappears; but, as an abnormality, it may persist. To the right. Ascending aorta. Right auricle. Right coronary artery.

THE CERVICAL FASCIA. 351 THE CERVICAL FASCIA. The deep fascia of the neck is conveniently divided for description into three portions : the outer or superficial, the middle, and the inner or deep, all of which, however, are continuous (Fig. 408). The Outer Cervical Fascia. The outer portio7i forms a firm investment for the organs of the neck, its shape being suggestive of a hollow cylinder. Its upper limit extends from the Fig. 408.—The cervical fascia, as seen in a horizontal section of the neck at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. (Testut.) external occipital protuberance to the lower part of the symphysis of the mandible, attaching itself to the series of skeletal prominences most nearly coinciding witli a line drawn around the head and inter- secting these points. Below it is fastened to the sternum, clavicle, acromion, and scapular spine, beyond the last named losing itself in the fascia of the back. Thus it includes, especially in its lower parts, somewhat more than the strict anatomical neck. It is at- tached behind to the ligamentum nuchse, and in front it is continuous across the middle line. In its course around the side of the neck it s])lits twice, first embracing the trapezius, and then the sterno-mastoid, form- ing strong sheaths for these muscles. Traced from below upward in the region in fi'ont of the sterno-mastoid, it is found to be attached to the hyoid, from which it runs to its ujiper limit on the lower border of the mandible (Fig. 409). From the hyoid insertion it sends to the internal oblique line of the mandible a Fig. -109.—The outer cervical fiiscia between the hyoid and mandible. (Testut.) lamella, which lines the

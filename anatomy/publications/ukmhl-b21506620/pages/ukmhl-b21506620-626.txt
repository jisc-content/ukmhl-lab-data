THE NERVES. 616 The posterior interosseous nerve (6. 7. c.) (Fig. 665), which is the terminal muscular branch of the musculo-spiral, is destined for the jjosterior group of forearm muscles. It descends between the brachialis anterior and extensor carpi radialis longus, where it gives branches to the extensor carpi radialis brevis and supinator (6. 7. c), and then enters the substance of the latter muscle, in which it winds round the radius to gain the interval between the superficial and deep Fig. 665.â€”Posterior interosseous nerve. (Testut.) muscles on the back of the forearm. Here it distributes twigs to all the sur- rounding extensors (7. c.) and passes to the interosseous membrane in the lower third of the forearm, where it joins the anterior interosseous artery. It descends beneath the posterior annular ligament under the extensor communis, and expands into a gangliform enlargement, from which branches are supplied to the carpal joints. The radial nerve (6. c.) (Figs. 660, 661, 662, 666, 667) is the other terminal division of the rausculo-spiral, and is purely cutaneous in its distribution. It

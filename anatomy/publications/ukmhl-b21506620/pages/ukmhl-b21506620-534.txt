624 THE CEREBBO-SPINAL AXIS. occasionally referred to as the extraventricular portion of the corpus striatum. The claustrum is a plate of gi'ay substance, embedded between the lenticular nucleus and the insula. The amygdaloid nucleus is a collection of gray matter near the apex of the temporal lobe. The Caudate Nucleus. Tlie caudate (" tailed ") nucleus protrudes into the cavity of the lateral ven- tricle at the fore part of the floor, the anterior horn curving forward and outward around its most prominent portion (Fig. 576). The front end is rounded, and faces upward, forward, and inward. From this large beginning the nucleus diminishes in size as it is traced backward, and hence the most conspicuous part of it is pear- shaped. But the stem of the pear—the tail or cauda, which gives its name to Fig. 576.—Lateral and third ventrir/K'S I'loin iiliove. The furnix and velum interpositum have been removed. EPI., ej^lphysis. M. C, middle commissure. P. C, posterior commissure. (Testut.) the nucleus—stretches backward and outward as a slender prolongation through the body of the ventricle to the rear end, and thence in a sweeping curve into the middle horn and even to its extremity, clinging to the roof of the cornu (Fig. 575). It thus describes almost a circle, the tip of it reaching a point nearly underneath the blunt beginning. As it embraces in its loop a considerable mass of brain-tissue, it has been named the surcivgle. It is not of regular outline, but is alternately and unevenly constricted and enlarged (Fig. 578). The caudate nucleus ends in the amygdala at the front end of the temporal lobe. Along the inner border of the caudate nucleus is a band of fibres, which may fairly be regarded as its proper edge. It is called the tamia semicii'cularis (" the half-circle ribbon ") (Figs. 576, 550). It accompanies the tail of the nucleus in the roof of the middle horn even to the amygdala. In the body of the ventricle it is covered by the vein of the corpus striatum.

545 THE OBLONGATA. Fig. 602.—Cerebellum in nearly horizontal section—the upiier .siuiuee of the lower section. (Tcstut.) THE OBLONGATA. The ohhvgata, also called medulla oblongata (" the oblong marrow"), and the spinal bulb, extends from the lower margin of the pons to a plane passing trans- versely just below the decussation of the pyramids, at which level the spinal cord begins. It is shaped somewhat like an inverted truncated cone, flattened ventro- dorsally. It lies upon the l)asilar process of the occipital bone, the inclination of which Fir,. 603.—Semidiagrani of the three cerebellar Fig. 604.—The pons and oblongata, ventral peduncles. (Testut.) view. (Testut.) On the ventral surface is a longitudinal cleft, the ventro-mcdian fissure, Avhieh l)egins above in a little pit, the foramen ccecum (" blind hole "), and is interrupted below by a criss-cross of nerve-bundles. On each side of the ventro-median fissure is a white body, gradually dwindling from above downward, and seeming to be directly continuous with the ventral column of the cord. These are the ventral pyramids, and the interlocking of the bundles at their lower part across the ventro-median fissure (constituting the above-mentioned criss-cross) is called the decussation of the jjyramids. At the outer side of each pyramid is a cleft, the ventro-lateral fissure, which is in line with the series of origins of the ventral roots of the spinal nerves. Oil each side tlie oblongata presents a vertical mass, tlie lateral column, or lateral tract, which is a[)parently continuous below with the lateral column of the cord, and above is encroached upon at the front part by a large ovoid mass, 35

THE CEBEBR0-8PINAL AXIS. 552 tiuued by a membrane of vascular and serous tissues. In the centre of this membrane is an aperture, the metapove, or foramen of Magendie. It is interesting and very important to observe (Figs. 611, 612) how large a part of the cranial nerves have their deep (real) origin in and close to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The average weight of the normal adult encephalon is in the region of 49 ounces for the male, and about five ounces less for the female. THE SPINAL CORD. The spinal cord (Fig. 613) is the terminal portion of the cerebro-spinal axis, and is a direct continuation of the oblongata, having its upper limit at the lowest level of the pyramidal decussa- tion. It is contained in the canal of the vertebral column. Like all other parts of the axis, it is bilaterally symmetrical. From it are given off almost all of the nerves which supply the volun- tary muscles of the parts below the head, and to it go the sensory nerves of the corresponding regions. Its shape approaches the cylindrical. It is slightly flattened ventro-dorsally, tapers at its caudal end, and presents a fusiform swelling in LUMBAR EN- LARGEMENT f TERMINAL CONE Fig. 613.—Spinal cord, oblongata, and pons.

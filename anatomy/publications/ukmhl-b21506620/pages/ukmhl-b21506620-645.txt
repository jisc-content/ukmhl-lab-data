635 POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE. abductor hallucis, flexor brevis digitorum, flexor brevis hallucis, and inner lumbrical muscle. It passes forward under the origin of tlie abductor hallucis, then in the groove between that muscle and the flexor brevis digitorum, accom- panying the internal plantar artery. Under cover of the plantar fascia it divides into four digital nerves. Of these the innermost passes undivided to the inner side of the great toe, giving a branch on its way to the flexor brevis hallucis, the remaining three nerves, emerging between the processes of plantar fascia, divide each into two collateral branches for the adjacent sides of the corresponding toes, the digital nerve to the first cleft supplying the inner lumbrical muscle, and the most external branch communicating with the external plantar nerve. The muscular branches to the abductor hallucis and flexor brevis digitorum are given Fig. 6S2.â€”Plantar nerves. (Testut.) off near the commencement of the nerve, articular fibres supply some of the joints of the foot, and plantar cutaneous twigs are distributed to the sole. As in the case of the corresponding nerve of the hand, the plantar digital nerves supply the skin on the dorsum of the ungual ])halanx and the bed of the nail. The External Plantar Nerve (Figs. 682, 684, 689, 690) accompanies the exter- nal plantar artery between tlie flexor brevis digitorum and flexor accessorins, till, gaining the hollow between the former muscle and the abductor minimi digiti, it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. Before dividing, it gives branches to the flexor accessorius and abductor minimi digiti. The superficial terminal branch sends one digital branch to the outer side of the little toe, and a second, which, passing beneath the plantar fascia to the cleft between the fourth and fifth toes, divides into collateral branches to their adjacent surfaces, first communicating with the internal plantar nerve. The outer digital

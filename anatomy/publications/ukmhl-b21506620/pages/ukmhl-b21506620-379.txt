THE HEART. 369 pal sets, anterior and posterior. From their summits project delicate tendons, chordce tendinne, which are inserted into the free edges and under sides of the flaps of the tricuspid valve. Running across the chamber obliquely is usually a prominent muscular beam, the moderator hand. Action.â€”When the muscular wall of the ventricle contracts, the cavity is practically obliterated, and its contents are discharged. As soon as contraction begins, the tricuspid valve is closed, and, were it not for the special restraining apparatus, its flaps would be swept into the auricle, and the greater part of the blood in the ventricle would go with them. But the papillary muscles come into action simultaneously with all other parts of the wall, and pull the valve down- ward exactly to the extent that the blood tends to push it upward beyond the plane at which the free margins of its segments come in close contact. Thus regurgitation is prevented, and the blood is forced through the only other avenue of escape, the pulmonary artery. The con- traction of the ventricle ceasing, the dis- tended artery has a tendency to return some of its contents to the ventricle ; but, as soon as the column of fluid starts back- ward, the semilunar festoons, which have been flattened by the outrush of blood from the heart, are closed with a snap, the accumulation in the sinuses behind them giving the first impulse, and the pressure of the fluid in the artery completing the act. In this way not a drop is allowed to regurgitate. The columnte carnese of the second and third varieties are useful in regulating conti-action and evenly dis- tributing pressure, the moderator band being of especial service in preventing too ^^^^ 426.-The three varieties of columns great distention and in causing approxima- carnea.

The nmsculi j^cctinafi are less numerous and less pi'onounced. Toward the rear on each side are the orifices of two pulmonary veins. The posi- tion of the ftietal foramen ovale is indicated bv a slight indentation on the septal wall. The aurirnlo-oodricidar openim/ is much like that in the right heart, but a little smaller. It is guarded by the bicuspid valve. The Left Ventricle has a capacity equal to that of the right, but its cavity has a different shape, being ovoidal. In general features it strongly resembles the other ventricle. The three varieties of columnce carnece are pi'esent; but, while these muscular bundles are more numerous, they are of less size. The papHhtri/ muscles are disposed in two series. A band, similar to the moderator of the right ventricle, but much smaller, crosses the chamber. At the uppermost part of the septum the wall is fibrous and very thin, constituting a weak area, sometimes called the undefended space. The auriculo-ventricular orifice and that of the aorta are very close together, the former being toward the rear, the latter near the front. The auriculo-ventricular valve is called hicmpid, on account of its having two chief segments, and mitral, because these flaps, when open, are somewhat suggestive of a bishop's mitre (Fig. 428). One segment lies close to the hind wall, the other and larger is between the two orifices. Frequently small second- ary segments are found l)etween the two great flaps. The valve is connected with papillary muscles by chordce tendinece, and in general features of structure is like the tricuspid, already described. The valve at the base of the aorta (Fig. 429) is a repetition of that of the pulmonary artery, except that in almost every respect its characteristics are more pronounced. The semilunar segments are situated 24

The two mammary glands, mainnue, or brea.sts, are accessory organs of genera- tion, their secretion, the mi/Jc, serving to sustain the infant until it is capable of deriving its nourishment from other sources. Philosophically considered, each mamma is a collection of sebaceous glands, greatly enlarged, and extending far into the subcutaneous region, which here is vastly deeper than elsewhere. The secretion of the sebaceous glands is oily, and that of their prodigious congeners is of the same character, thougli in the one case the fluid is devoted to purposes of lubrication, in the other to nutritive uses. Each breast is approximately hemispherical, and a little below the centre of its convexity presents a mammUla (nipple, teat, dug), usually shaped like a trun- cated cone, half an inch long, jiointing forward, upward, and outward, and set in the middle of a circular area of darker skin, the areola. The breast covers a nearly circular space, mostly in front of the pectoralis major, extending from the second to the sixth rib, and from the sternum to the border of the armpit. The location of the nipple is usually given as at the level of the fourth rib ; but its position is dependent upon various circumstances, such as age, pregnancy, lactation, corpulence, firmness of tissues, race, attitude of body, (not to mention numerous diseases), so that it becomes one of the least trust- worthy of landmarks.

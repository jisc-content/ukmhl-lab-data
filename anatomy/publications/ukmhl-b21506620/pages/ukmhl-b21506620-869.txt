SURFACE ANATOMY. The subject of the photographs, of which the series of pictures in this section are reproductions, was a young athlete of well-balanced development. It would be easy to procure re])re.sentations of a man with much larger muscles, but they would be less useful in the illustration of normal anatomy. The main purpose of these engravings is to show the relations of structures, especially muscles, to the surface. The most of them are accompanied by keys, which more than sup- ply the place of verbal description ; in the remainder the prineijial features are sufficiently apparent without explanation other than occurs in the legend. Every student is earnestly advised to study surface anatomy upon the living model. Each can use his chum for this purpose, if he will reciprocate such favors as he receives ; and many things he can learn from his own person, ])articularly well in front of a large mirror. He should carry his studies in this direction much further than is attempted in this series of jiictures, and in this eflPort he will derive all the help that he needs from the numerous cuts which embellish the pages devoted to descriptive anatomy.

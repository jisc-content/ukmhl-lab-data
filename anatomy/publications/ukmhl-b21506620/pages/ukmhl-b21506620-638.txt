THE NER VES. 628 sacral nerve to form the sacral plexus ; the rest of the fourth sacral and remain- ing nerves form the coccygeal plexus. The Sacral Plexus (Fig. 676). A variable portion of tlie fourth lumbar nerve joins the fifth lumbar to form the lumbo-sacral cord. This trunk crosses the brim of the pelvis, pierces the pelvic fascia, and under cover of this fascia joins the sacral nerves on the ventral y' FOURTH LUMBAR Fig. 676.â€”Plan of sacral plexus. surface of the pyriformis muscle. With the first and second and greater part of the third sacral nerves the lumbo-sacral cord forms a great compound nervous trunk called the great sciatic nerve. A small band from the second sacral unites with the remainder of the third sacral and with the fourth sacral nerves to form the internal pudic nerve. Thus the two main or terminal trunks are formed; but, in addition to these, numerous collateral branches are given otf: the superior gluteal, the inferior gluteal, the small sciatic, the perforating cutaneous, and nerves to the pyriformis, obturator interims, gemelli and quadratus femoris. The branches of this plexus are divisible into a dorsal and a ventral set. In the diagram the dorsal set are shaded. They spring from the back of the plexus and supply the extensor aspect of the limb ; the ventral set spring from the anterior surface of the plexus and supply the flexor muscles. COLLATERAL BRANCHES. The twigs to the pyriformis are derived from the first and second sacral nerves. The nerve to the (jundrcdus femo7'is lies on the ventral surface of the plexus, its fibres springing from the lumbo-sacral cord and first sacral nerve. On the hip it is seen descending under the obturator internus and gemelli to reach the ventral surface of the quadratus, distributing on its way branches to the inferior gemellus and hip-joint.

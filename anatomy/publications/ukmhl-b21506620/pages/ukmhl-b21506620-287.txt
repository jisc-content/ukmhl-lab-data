Insertion, each to extensor communis tendon of corresponding- iinger on the radial side of the first phalanx. Action, flexion of the first phalanges, and extension of the second and third phalanges. The first and second slightly abduct the index and middle fingers from the middle line of the hand, the third and fourth slightly adduct the ring and little fingers to that line. Nerves, the median for the outer two, the ulnar for the inner two. Extensor Communis Digitorum (Figs. 310-312).---" The common extensor of the digits "—/. e., of the fingers, as distinguished from the thumb. Situation, superficially on the l)ack of the forearm and hand. Origin, the outer condyle of the humerus. Direction, downward. Insertion: each of the four tendons finally divides into three slips op- posite the first phalanx, and the middle one is attached to the back of the base of the second phalanx ; the others, after uniting, are attached to the back of the base of the third phalanx. The first tendon receives the inser- tion of the extensor indicis at the base of the finger ; the fourth tendon unites with Fig. 312.—Relations of the inter- Fig. 313.—Extensor minimi digiti Fig. 314.—Extensor indicis of osseous and lumbrical muscles to the of right side: outline and attach- right side: outline and attach- extensor tendons.

The fourth divides : one part unites witli the tendon of the medius, the other with that of the extensor minimi digiti. A strong band connects the tendons of the ring and middle fingers. Action, extension of the fingers. The ol)lique branches at the sides of the third tendon greatly limit the extension of the ring finger, when its immediate neighbors are

THE NERVES. 620 The lateral mdaneous branch of ihe second intercostal nerve is called the inter- costo-humeral. It crosses the floor of the axilla just under the deep fascia, joins the nerve of Wrisberg, and supplies a strip of skin on the inner and posterior aspect of the arm. Fig. 669.—Cutaneous distribution of thoracic nerves. (Testut.) The lateral cidaneoiis branch of the third intercostal nerve has a small anterior branch which passes forward over the pectoralis major, and a large posterior branch, which, after communicating with the intercosto-humeral nerve, is dis- tributed to the skin of the axilla and dorsum of the scapula, a small branch reaching the arm.

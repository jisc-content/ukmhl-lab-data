THE MUSCLES. 330 or seven thoracic vertebrae and the last cervical, and from the articular processes of cervical vertebrae from the third to the sixth. It is inserted into the occipital bone, on the mesial part of the surface between the curved lines. The portion nearest the middle line is somewhat detached, and has a tendinous inscription about half way of its length, on account of which it is often reckoned as a separate muscle, the biventer cervicis. It extends the head, drawing it to one side. Its nerve-supply is from several upper cervical nerves. Semispinalis cervicis (Fig. 392), the name meaning " the muscle of the neck, one extremity of which is attached to spinous processes," arises from the transverse processes of the upper five or six thoracic vertebra}, and is inserted into the spinous processes of cervical from the second to the fifth. It extends the neck, and rotates it to the opposite side. Its nerves are branches from the lower cervical and upper thoracic. Semispinalis dorsi (Fig. 392), " the muscle of the back, one end of which is attached to spinous processes," arises from the transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae from the sixth to the tenth, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the last two cervical and of the upper four, five, or six thoracic vertebrae. Its principal action is extension of the lower cervi- cal and uj)j)or thoracic regions. It is supplied by thoracic spinal nerves. Multifidus (Fig. 392), " the many-cleft muscle," occupies the greater part of the gutter beside the vertebral spines from the sacrum to the axis. Its fibres pass from some part (usually a process) of one vertebra to the spinous processes of several vertebrae above it, generally the second, third, and fourth. It arises from the groove on the back of the sacrum, the mammillary processes in the lumbar region, the transverse in the thoracic region, and the articular of the lower four cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into all the spinous j^rocesses of the true ver- tebrae. It extends, bends sidewise, and rotates to the opposite side the spinal column. The posterior branches of the spinal nerves supply it. Rotatores, rotators of the spine, lie covered in by the multifidus, and are by some regarded as part of it. They are constant only in the thoracic region, are eleven in number, and each passes between the transverse pi'ocess of one vertebra and the lamina of the next above. They produce rotation of the spine to the opposite side, and also bend it backward and sidewise. Their nerves are the thoracic. In the cervical and lumbar regions are found a series of small muscles, called interspinales, which pass from one spinous process to the next above ; and another series, the intertmmversales (intertransversarii), which connect one transverse pro- cess with the next above. The former assists in extension of the spine, the latter in its lateral flexion. 393.—Trachelo-mastoid and com- (Testut.) Suboccipital, Muscles. Rectus capitis posterior major.

Rectus Capitis Posterior Major (Fig. 392).—The name means literally " the greater straight liind muscle of the head." It arises from the spine of the axis,

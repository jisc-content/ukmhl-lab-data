715 THE STOMACH. usually given ; and, finally, that the perpendicular plane on each side starts from a prominent landmark, and fairly apportions each of the three zones. The abdominal cavity is lined with the largest of the serous membranes, the peritoneum. At various places this membrane is reflected from the wall onto the contained viscera, to some of which it furnishes a slight, to others a considerable, and to others still a practically complete outer tunic, thus justifying its name, which means literally something " stretched around." Until the anatomy of the abdominal viscera is learned, a description of the peritoneum cannot be appre- ciated ; and, therefore, further consideration of the subject will be deferred until the discussion of the digestive organs has been completed. THE STOMACH. The gullet perforates the diaphragm, and almost immediately ends in the stomach {stomachus, gader), the tube expanding into a great bag (Fig. 764). The Fig. 764.â€”Stomach and duodenum, tlie liver and most of the intestines having been removed. (Testut.) stomach is just beneath the diaphragm and behind the anterior abdominal wall, in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Its shape and attitude are worthy of especial attention. It looks somewhat like a pear with the large end up, and the small end bent sidewise to the right. Its front and rear surfaces are moderately convex. Looking at it from before, it is seen that a continuation of the right margin of the oesophagus downward coincides with the upper two-thirds of the right border of the stomach, the remaining third of this border bending sharply to the right and backward, tiius completing what is known as the small curvature. The great curvature begins at the end of the gullet on the opposite side, making a somewhat acute angle with the left border of this tube. It then

The narrow strait between the great and small cavities of the peritoneum is called the foramen of Winslow, and foramen epiplo'icum (Figs. 808, 809). It is bounded in front by the vessels entering and leaving the portal fissure of the liver, COMMON HEPATIC BILE DUCT ARTERY Fig. 809.—Transverse horizontal section through the foramen of Winslow.

The Small Sac of the Peritoneum (Figs. 810, 811).—In the embryo the small sac roaches at first but little lower tlian the stomach ; but afterward it enlarges rapidly by extension downward, and forms a ])ouch, which hangs from the great curvature of the stomach in front of the intestines, and contracts adhesion to and blends with the frf)nt part of the serous coat of the transverse colon, thus estab- FiG. 810,-Diagram of a sagittal section of the Fig. 811.—Diagram of a sagittal section of the abdo- abdomen of an embryo, showing the reflections of men of an adult, showing the growth of the small the peritoneum in the great cavity and the small cavity, and the application of its rear wall to the trans- cavity.

It is thus seen that the name " cavity of the great omentum " is synonymous with " the small cavity of the peritoneum." Not only does the small sac become adherent to the colon, but its posterior double layer becomes attached to and merged with the anterior (up])or) surface of the transverse mesocolon.; and so intimate is this connection that this part of the

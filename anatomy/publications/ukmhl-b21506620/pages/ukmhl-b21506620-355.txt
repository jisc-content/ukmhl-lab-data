345 SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. Orbicularis Oris (Fig. 407).—" The orbicular muscle of the mouth "—that is, encircling the oral orifice. Surrounding the opening of the mouth, and extending from the nose above to the chin below, is an elliptical muscle, which forms a great part of the bulk of the lips, and constitutes a sphincter to the aperture. It does not, however, consist of concentric bundles of fibres, but is made up very largely of prolongations from various muscles of the face, which converge to its margin. It is attached above to the partition between the nostrils and to the incisor fossse Fig. 407.—Superficial muscles of head and neck. (Testut.) of the upper jaw-bones, and below to the incisor fossae of the mandible. It is covered in front by skin, behind and on its free border by mucous membrane. The action of this muscle is to close the lips and press them against the teeth. It antagonizes all of the remaining members of this group, except the levator labii inferioris.

378 THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. The veins are more numerous tlian the arteries, and the capacity of the venous system is considerably greater than that of the arterial. The veins have a structure, which in the main, is like that of the arteries ; but there are such variations of detail that, in some respects, the two sets of vessels behave very diiferently. The inner coat is essentially like the arterial intiraa, with the addition of numei'ous transverse folds, which, strengthened by plates of white fibrous tissue, form valves (Fig. 438). The middle tunic is thinner than that of the arteries of comparable size, contains less muscle, more white fibrous, and only a little yellow fibrous tissue. The external coat is very like that of the arteries. This combination I'esults in vessels which are very Fig. 437.—Diagram, showing the formation of large Fig. 438.—Valves of veins.

(Testut.) blood ; whereas arteries, stiffened as they are with elastic and a large amount of muscular tissue, stand open in similar circumstances. The valves are not found in all veins. They generally have two flaps each, which are directed toward the heart, when ojoen. At the base of each valve the vein bulges, forming a sinus, into which the blood enters as soon as any obstruc- tion to its flow occui's, and causes instant closure of the valve. A few exceptions are found to the rule that capillaries intervene between arterioles and venules. In the interior of erectile organs small arteries may open directly into venous cavities ; and in the spleen the arteries discharge into the interstices of the organ.

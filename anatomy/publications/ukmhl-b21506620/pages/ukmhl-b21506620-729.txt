719 THE SMALL INTESTINE. and the exactly opposite portion of the gut is known as the free border. The outer layer of the muscular tunic is complete, thin, composed of bundles arranged lengthwise, and thickest in the region of the free border. The inner layer, also, is complete, but is thicker, and its fasciculi are transverse, forming a circular laver. This coat thins out gradually as the intestine approaches its lower end. The Areolar Coat.—Inside of the muscular is the areolar (submucous, vascu- lar) coat, in whose meshes are networks of blood-vessels, lymphatics and nerves.

The Mucous Coat.—Finally, we reach the mucous membrane, which is attached by its outer aspect to the areolar tunic, and presents a free surface to the bore of the tube. Its corium contains lymphoid tissue, with many leucocytes, and a rich supply of vessels and nerves. Outside of this is a distinct muscularis mucoste, with an inner plate of circular, and an outer plate of longitudinal fibres.

(Testut.) of the corium is a basement memlirane, surmounted by a single layer of prismatic, columnar, epithelial cells, which are characterized by the presence of a delicate plate on the free end of eacli, marked with vertical lines. Among these epithelial cells are many of the goblet \ ariety. The Villi (Fig. 770j.—A peculiarity, which distinguishes the mucous mem- brane of the small intestine is the presence everywhere of minute projections.

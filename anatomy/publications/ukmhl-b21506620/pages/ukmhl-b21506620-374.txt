THE FASCIA. 364 THE FASCI-ffi OF THE FOOT. The homology of the fascije of the foot and hand is so marked that it is unnecessary to dwell minutely upon the former, the latter having been already described. That in the sole is called the plantar fascia, and is divided into three parts. The central portion starts from the inner tuberosity of the calca- neum, runs forward below the flexor brevis digitorum, and terminates in front in a process for each toe and in slips for the skin. At the sides it is continuous with Fig. 421.—The internal annular ligament of the ankle Fig. 422.—The external annular ligament of the and the artificially distended synovial membranes of the ankle and the artificially distended synovial mein- tendons which it confines. (Testut.) brane of the tendons wliich it confines. (Testut.) the lateral portions, which extend around the margins of the foot. Where the central portion joins each lateral a process passes upward, and thus are formed partitions between corresponding groups of muscles. The external lateral por- tion is attached behind to the calcaneum, the internal to the internal annular liga- ment. The interosseous fasciae, the dorsal fascia, and the superficial transverse ligament of the toes, all are similar to their homologues in the upper limb, but the last named connects five digits, instead of only four. The tendons of the toes are kept in place by fibrous bands, and are provided with synovial membranes, as are the corresponding organs in the hand.

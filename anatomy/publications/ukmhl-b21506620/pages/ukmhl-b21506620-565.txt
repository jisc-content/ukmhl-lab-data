555 THE SPINAL COBD. At the back part of the lateral column, close to the dorsal horn, is an oval area, the crossed pyramidal trad—"pyramidal," for the reason just given; " crossed," on account of the decussation which occurs in the oblongata. It dwindles as it descends, and ceases at the third or fourth sacral nerve-root. Between the outer side of the crossed pyramidal tract and the surface of the lateral column is the dorsal ])art of a long, narrow area, the direct cerebellar tract, so called because its fibres course upward through the oblongata as straight as possible to the cerebellum. It appears at the level of the eighth or ninth thoracic nerve-root, and progressively increases, as it ascends. Fig. 616.—Diagrammatic ideal transverse section of the spinal cord. On the left side arc shown the gross divisions ; on the right side, the conduction paths. (F. H. G.) Anterior to this is a somewhat triangular area, which extends to, perhaps beyond, the jdace of exit of the ventral roots, the ascendinr/ lateral tract, or the Gowers tract—named "ascending," from the direction in which it carries impres- sions ; " lateral," from its position. It occupies the whole length of the cord, and increases in size from l)elo\v upward. Lodged in the curve of the gray comma, and penetrated by the interlocking strands of the reticula, where the latter exists, is the deep lateral association tract (otherwise knowia as the mixed lateral). The first and second Avords in this title are self-explanatory ; the third is chosen because it is descriptive of the function of the fibres composing this tract. These fibres originate in cells of the gray substance of the cord, run a sl)ort course, then turn into the gray, and end in arborizations around its cells. Thus, they act as longitudinal commissures, associating each part of the cord with parts a short distance above and below. The remaining areas in the ventral and lateral columns are perfectly con-

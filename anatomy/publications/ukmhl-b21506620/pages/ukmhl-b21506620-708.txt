THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 698 But all of these things—distension, contraction, peristalsis, compression—can take place without making trouble, for the organs have so slippery an outer sur- face that they glide freely on one another during the less movements, and slide elusively out of the way of extraneous force. Gas in the Alimentary Tube.—The tube in the larger part of its course gen- erally contains more or less gas, which, by keeping the opposite walls somewhat separated from each other, prevents the injury which would probably come from the prolonged rubbing together of these soft and delicate surfaces. In some regions, however, as in the gullet, the opposite surfaces of the membi'ane are in contact nearly all of the time; but in these cases the structure is very different from that in the stomach and intestines, especially as regards the epithelium, which, instead of being tender and in a single lamina, as in the latter organs, is hard and stratified, and capable of withstanding the influence of incessant pressure and friction. THE MOUTH. The mouth (os) (Fig. 745) is the organ in which are accomplished wholly or in part the functions of prehension, mastication, insalivation, gustatory sensa- FiG. 745.-Sagittal section of the face and neck, showing the first portions of the alimentary and respiratory- tracts. (Testut.) tion, and articulation. Its name is applied popularly not only to the cavity in the face, Avhich consti- tutes the initial segment of the alimentary canal, but also to the aperture of entrance and to the lips ; but anatomists use it only in the first sense. It is not always an actual cavity—a fact demonstrated in sagittal frozen sections, in which

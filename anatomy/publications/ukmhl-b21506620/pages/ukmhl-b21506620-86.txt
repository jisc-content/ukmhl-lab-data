At first no cavity exists in the centre of the morula, but soon the outer cells become in large part forced away from the inner ones by the imbibition of a fluid supplied by the walls of the uterus, and what is SEGMENTA- TION CAVITY.

The morula is thus converted into a liollow vesicle, termed the blastodermic vesicle, whose wall is formed by a single layer of cells, except at ;iDA. one region, where what were the inner cells of the morula form a lenticular thickening (Fig. 90). 3ERM. Later, this thickening flattens out, its cells becoming arranged in two layers, the innermost of which is composed of thin flat- tened cells, and forms what is termed the endodemi layer, while the outer one, consisting of cylin- drical cells, is known as the ecto- derm. External to these two layers, again, is a third one of flattened cells, termed the covering cells, which is continuous with the wall of the vesicle, but which Fig. 90.-Blastodermic vesicle.

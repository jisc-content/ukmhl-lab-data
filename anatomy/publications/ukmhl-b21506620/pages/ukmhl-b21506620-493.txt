It is joined by tributaries corresponding to the branches of the artery, including the Deep Femoral Vein (which ascends in front of its artery), and also, near its upper end, by the internal saphenous vein. It contains three or four valves, one of which is just above the opening of the profunda vein, and another just below the inguinal ligament. At its upper end it is separated inter- nally from the crural canal by a thin septum of fascia, passing between the front and rear walls of the femoral sheath.

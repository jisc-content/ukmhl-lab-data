152 THE BONES. which attach the rotator muscles. The neck extends inward, upward, and slightly forward from the shaft to the head. It is compressed from before backward, but vertically expanded, especially where it joins the shaft. Its length is greater behind and below, and it is concave behind. Its axis forms an angle of 126° with that of the shaft. At birth this angle averages 160°. During growth, owing to the weight of the body, it decreases to from 140° to 110° ; but after growth is completed it remains fixed. It is less in females and short subjects. Fig. 171.—The right femur, front view. (Testut.) Fig. 172.—The right femur, rear view. (Testut.) The head is received into the acetabulum of the hip-bone. It forms more than half a sphere, and is covered with cartilage, except at a small ])it behind and below the centre, to the upper half of which the ligamentum teres is attached. At the junction of the neck and shaft the two trochanters project. The great tro- chanter is a stout, quadrilateral plate, continuous with the outer surface of the shaft, which reaches nearly to the highest level of the neck. On its outer surface the gluteus medius is attached to an oblique line extending downward and forward

The caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus have commonly been described Fig. 574.—Diagram to show the continuity of the gray of the basal ganglia of the cerebral hemispheres, the cortex, and the lower segments of the cerebro-spinal axis. (F. H. G.) as parts of a single body, called corpm striatum (" striped body "), on account of the peculiar, striped appearance of the surfaces resulting from its section ; but description is facilitated by treating them as independent structures.

An incision four inches in length is made on the inner border of the sterno-cleido- mastoid, extending to the sterno-clavicular articulation. A second incision of the same length is made over the clavicle parallel with it, meeting the first incision.

This should be divided completely across at a point one and a half inches above the sternum, and the lower part turned downward and held out of the way. The sterno-thyroid and sterno-hyoid muscles come now into view, and are divided in the same way. This usually exposes the inferior thyroid veins, which are either carefully pushed out of the way, or are ligated at two points, and divided. The common carotid is now exposed, and followed downward until the brachio-cephalic is reached. The left brachio-cephalic vein crosses the arteiy in the lower half of its course, the

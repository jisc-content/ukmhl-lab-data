602 THE NERVES. The dorsal divisions of the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves divide like the others into internal and external branches ; but both these branches are distributed to muscles only. The Dorsal Primary Division of the First Cervical or Suboccipital Nerve (Fig. 655).—The first cervical or suboccipital nerve leaves the cranio-vertebral canal by passing between the occipital bone and the dorsal arch of the atlas. The dorsal division, slightly larger than the ventral, passes backward under the ver- tebral artery, and enters the suboccipital triangle. This space is bounded by the rectus capitis posterior major internally, the obliquus inferior infero-externally, and the obliquus superior supero-externally. Here the nerve divides into the folloAving four branches : [a) a branch to the obliquus inferior which furnishes an anastomotic filament to the great occipital nerve; (6) a branch running upward to the recti capitis posteriores major and minor; (c) a third branch enters the obliquus superior; (cZ) and a fourth branch supplies the complexus on its deep surface. The Great Occipital Nerve (Figs. 654, 655).—The dorsal primary division of the second cervical nerve is three or four times as large as the ventral division. Its external branch is small and is distributed to the inferior oblique, complexus, and trachelomastoid; but the internal branch is large, and from its size and distribu- tion is called the Great Occipital Nerve.

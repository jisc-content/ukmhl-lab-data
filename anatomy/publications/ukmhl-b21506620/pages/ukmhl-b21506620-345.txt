(Testut.) inner surface of the last six costal cartilages, interdigitating with the transver- salis abdominis. Finally, the ensiform cartilage gives attachment to a small Fig. 400.—Intercostal mu.scles in riglit wall of thorax. (Testut.) band. The central tendon looks something like a trefoil, is very large, and to it the muscular bundles converge from the entire margin of the muscle. The aortic opening, already described, gives passage to the aorta, thoracic duct.

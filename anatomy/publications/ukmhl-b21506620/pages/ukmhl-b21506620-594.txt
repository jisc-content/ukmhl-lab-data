584 THE NERVES. lingual, conveying to it chorda-tympani and trifacial fibres (motor and sensory), and filaments which join it from the sympathetic plexus round the facial artery. It distributes branches to the submaxillary gland and Wharton's duct, and a branch to the sublingual gland, which reaches the gland by joining the lingual, assuming the appearance of another root. The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 643).—The otie (" ear ") ganglion is a small reddish gray, oval body, compressed from side to side, and about one-sixth of an inch in its long diameter. It is closely attached to or may surroimd the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle, lying on the inner side of the mandibular trunk Fig. 644.—Nerves of the tongue. (Testut.) close to the foramen ovale. Behind it is the middle meningeal artery, and on its inner side are the Eustachian tube and tensor palati muscle. Its motor and sensory roots reach it through the nerve to the internal ptery- goid muscle; but it is also connected wdth the facial and glossopharyngeal nerve through the small superficial petrosal nerve. From the plexus round the middle meningeal artery it receives its sympathetic root. It Jis<)-?6«fes'branches to join the auriculotemporal, by which route the parotid gland is supplied from the glossopharyngeal nerve ; also muscular twigs to the tensor palati and tensor tympani, and a communicating filament to the chorda

THE ARTERIES. 451 the extensor proprius hallucis. The artery will be found on the interosseous membi'ane, accompanied by vense comites, and with the anterior tibial nerve to the outer side. Now that the student has reviewed the arteries of the leg, it is advised that sketches be made of transverse sections at several levels showing the position of the vessels and their relation to other structures. Fig. 487.â€”Surgical relations of the anterior tibial artery of the right leg. (Kocher.) Branches of the anterior tibial are the anterior tibial recurrent, the posterior tibial recurrent, muscular, and the internal and external malleolar arteries. The posterior tibial recurrent is given off from the vessel before it gains tlie anterior aspect of the leg.

The anterior tibial recurrent is given off from the vessel immediately after it appears on the anterior surface of

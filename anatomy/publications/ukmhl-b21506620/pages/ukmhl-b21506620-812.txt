THE DUCTLESS GLANDS. 800 one on the outer aspect. They are called the parathyroids (glandulce jwrathy- roidece). They are not like the thyroid in structure, being solid accumulations of epithelioid cells, among which run many blood-vessels. Various theories concerning their function have been advanced, but we are still ignorant of their service. The Carotid Glands. The two f/landulce carotlcce are thus named because each is situated in the bifurcation of a common carotid artery. They are composed of nodules, each of which is a mass of epithelioid cells, among which are large capillaries. A fibrous capsule covers the gland and sends trabeculse between the nodules. The Coccygeal Gland. The glandula coccygea is situated in front of the tip of the coccyx. It is about one-tenth of an inch in diameter,,and is very similar in structure to the carotid glands. The hypophysis has already been described.

504 THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. above, can now be appreciated. It is iter a tertio ad quartum ventricidum (" the passage from the third to the fourth ventricle"), a name with the merit of descriptiveness, but with the fault of tiresome length. ■OUR T H Fig. 543.—Diagram of changes in fiftli vesicle- view from above. The cavity of the mi/elon or s])inal cord retains its original, cylindrical shape, and is called the central canal of the spinal cord. It is continuous at its cephalic end witli the fourth ventricle. The preceding diagrams have been drawn as if all of the vesicles were upon the same plane, for the sake of simplicity ; but, during their synchronous development, a marked CAVITY SPINAL CORD Fig. 544.—Diagram of clianges in fiftli vesicle—view from left side. curve with a ventral concavity takes place at about the junction of the third ventricle and the aqueduct, and thus the long axis of the spinal cord is brought nearly to a right angle with the plane of the lateral ventricles. The description of the encephalic vesicles here given is not designed for a portrayal of the process which is discovered by em- . . bryological research, but is intended merely \J to present in a diagrammatic manner the main features of the results which are bro5?na?L7s-vfe7from\^^^^^^^^ reached by the developmental process. The shape and relative size of these different cavities, when fully formed, can be seen in Fig. 546, which represents a cast, made by filling them with a liquid material, which solidified on standing. The surrounding solid tissue being removed, we obtain a perfect cast of the general ventricidar cavity, as the combined chambers and tubes of the encephalou are called.

476 THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. behind the psoas muscle the lumbar veins of each side are connected by con- tinuous vertical branches, called the ascending lumbar vein, which communicates below with the ilio-lumbar, common iliac, and lateral sacral veins, and is usually continued above as the azygos vein of the corresponding side. The Common Iliac Veins. The Common Iliac Veins, formed opposite the sacro-iliac articulations by the confluence of the internal and the external iliac veins, converge as they ascend, and unite opposite the right upper segment of the fifth lumbar vertebra to form the inferior vena cava. The right vein, shorter and more vertical than the left, lies behind and internal to its artery below, but above crosses obliquely behind it to its outer or right side, where it is joined by the left vein. The latter lies internal to the left common iliac artery and then crosses behind the upper end of the right artery to join the right vein. They contain no valves, except an occasional one in the left vein. Tributaries.â€”The ilio-lumbar veins follow the ilio-lumbar arteries, and enter the common or internal iliac veins. They resemble the lumbar veins in their course, formation, and connections. The middle sacral veins, one on each side of the artery of the same name, ascend on the front of the sacrum to open into the left common iliac vein, after uniting into a single trunk. Occasionally this trunk enters the angle of junction of the two common iliac veins. These veins anasto- mose with the lateral sacral and the hemori'hoidal veins.

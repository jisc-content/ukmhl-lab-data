634 THE NERVES. Between the internal malleolus and the inner tuberosity of the os calcis the posterior tibial divides into the internal and external plantar nerves. Branches.—(o) Muscular branches (5.1., 1. 2. s.) supply the tibialis posterior, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus hallucis; besides which there is a sup- plementary branch to the soleus. (6) The fibular branch accompanies the peroneal artery, supplying these vessels, the flbular periosteum and the medulla of that bone. GREftT SCIATIC NERVE Fig. 681—Deep nerves of the back of the leg. (Testut.) (c) The calcaneo-plantar nerve (1. 2. s.), arising from the posterior tibial in the lower fourth of the leg, becomes cutaneous by piercing the internal annular liga- ment. It then divides into internal calcaneal branches to the skin of the heel, and plantar cutaneous branches to the inner side of the sole. (rj) Articular filaments supply the ankle-joint. The Internal Plantar Nerve (Figs. 682, 684, 686, 689, 690) (4.5. 1., 1. s.) is slightly the larger of the two terminal divisions of the posterior tibial. It dis- tributes cutaneous nerves to the inner three and a half toes, and supplies the

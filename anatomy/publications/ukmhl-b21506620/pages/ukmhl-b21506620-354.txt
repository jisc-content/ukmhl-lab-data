It is helpful to group them according to their situation into those related to the orifice of the mouth, those of the nose, those of the eyelids, those of the forehead, and that of the occiput. Besides these ai'e others, which, in a secondary though important way, contribute to expression. The muscles which move the eyes are very effective in betraying emotion, and the muscular tongue, usitally concealed in the oral cavity, may, either with or without partial protrusion from its retreat, be made to convey as distinct an idea as can be given by articulate speech.

(Testut.) -Pterygoid muscles, viewed from behind, tlie baclc portion of the skull having been removed. the rudimentary homologues of organs, which, in many lower animals, are strik- ingly useful in expressing various feelings. But the muscles of the orbit and of the external ear are treated more appropriately in connection with the organs of the special senses ; and those of the tongue are best presented, in company with the palatal and pharyngeal, as parts of the alimentary system, just as the laryn- geal are discussed most conveniently with the respiratoiy system, and the peri- neal with the generative system.

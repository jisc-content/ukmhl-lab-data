THE NERVES. 666 the outer side of the pons, and can be traced dorsally to the valvula, whence it emerges. The fifth arises by two bundles from the side of the pons, the smaller motor root being in front of and ventral to the larger sensory root. The sixth springs from the groove between the pons and anterior pyramid, the seventh and eighth from the same groove but more laterally. A small bundle between the seventh and eighth, called the pars intermedia, furnishes an additional root to the seventh. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh arise as a series of small bundles from the side of the oblongata in a vertical line, dividing the restiform body from the olive and lateral column of the cord. The spinal portion of the spinal accessory emerges by numerous bundles from the side of the cord in a direct line Avith the rest of this group, extending as far down as the fifth, sixth, or even seventh cervical nerve. The twelfth nerve springs by ten or twelve small bundles from the groove between the olivary body and anterior pyramid, and thus lies ventral to the pre- FiG. 627.—Under surface of the Ijrain, showing the superficial origins of the cranial nerves. The Eoman numerals indicate the nerves. (Testut.j ceding series, and nearer the pons than the last of them. It lies in series with the anterior roots of the first spinal nerves. Deep or Nuclear Origins of the Cranial Nerves.—Like the spinal nerves the cranial nerve-roots can be traced till tiiey come into close relationship with cer- tain groups of cells, which, for anatomical and physiological reasons, we regard as their deep origins. It is impossible for the student to study this subject till he has thoroughly mastered the anatomy of the brain and especially of the oblongata and pons; but, when he has learned the gross anatomy of the central nervous system, he will find much living interest in what is now known of this obscure but vitally important section.

THE LARGE INTESTINE. 735 produces a watery (serous) secretion, the third a glairy (mucous) one, and the second a fluid which is between the two in consistency. Fig. 794.â€”The salivary glands. The right half of the body of the mandible has been removed. GL. W., gland of Weber. GL. B., gland of Blandin. (Testut.) The Parotid Gland. The parotid ("near the ear") gland (Fig. 794) is the largest salivary gland, and is situated in the side of the face, extending from the zygoma to the angle of the mandible, and fron) the external auditory meatus forward upon the masseter, dipping deeply between the ramus and the mastoid, and pushing in between the pterygoid muscles. It is bound down by the masseteric fascia. The parotid (Stenson's) duct, by which the saliva is discharged, leaves the gland at its front border, and passes forward horizontally about three-quarters of an inch below the zygoma for two and a half inches. On reaching the anterior margin of the mas- seter, it turns mesially, and perforates all of the buccal layers, except the mucosa, on the outer surface of which it then courses forward until it reaches a point opposite the second upper molar tooth, where it pierces the membrane, and ends in a contracted orifice. Usually an appendage, the glandula soda parotidis, lies above the first part of the duct, and pours its secretion into it. In the substance of the parotid gland the external carotid artery makes its terminal division, the facial nerve radiates into its branches, and the temporo- maxillary vein, some lymph-nodes, and branches of the great auricular nerve are situated. The Submaxillary Gland. The submaxillary gland (Fig. 794) is about a third as large as the parotid. It is lodged in a chamber of the deep cervical fascia, mostly below the body of

683 THE EYE. by the breaking up of the membrane of Descemet, contains a number of minute spaces, the spaces of Fontana, which communicate with the aqueous chamber on the one hand, and, on the other, with a minute venous sinus contained in a canal in the sclerotic, which encircles the margin of the cornea. This is the canal of Schlemyn. The substantia propria of the cornea is composed of many superposed layers of connective tissue, the fibres of contiguous layers having different directions, and all being inseparably held together, as in the sclerotic, by many interchanges of fibres. Between the layers, and even between the bundles and fibrils of which they are composed, there is an interstitial cement substance, in which are found lymph-spaces, occupied, but not filled, by the corneal corpuscles, and all directly or indirectly communicating so as to provide for a very complete lymph-vascular circulation. Unlike the sclerotic, the cornea is richly supplied with nerves, which are derived from the ciliary. They first form a plexus around its margin ; then, losing their medullary sheath, they form another plexus in the laminated struct- ure ; from this branches proceed to form a third plexus on the corneal surface beneath the conjunctival epithelium ; finally, fibrils pass in among the epithelial cells, and reach their terminal distribution almost at the free surface of the con- junctiva. THE MIDDLE OR VASCULAR TUNIC. In the vascular tunic, or uveal tract, of the eye (Fig. 732) three parts may be distinguished : the choroid behind, the iris in front, and the ciliary zone, or body, ARTERIES Fig. 732.â€”Vessels and nerves of the choroid and iris, seen from above. The sclerotic and cornea have been largely removed. (Testut.) between. The choroid and ciliary zone are applied to the inner surface of the sclerotic ; but, except at the optic nerve entrance and the attachment of the ciliary

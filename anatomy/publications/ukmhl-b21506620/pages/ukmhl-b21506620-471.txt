461 THE VEINS. the subclavian vein. It receives a branch from the facial vein which descends along' the ventral border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. A transverse branch connects the lower ends of the veins of the two sides, and others may exist higher up. Its position behind the origin of the sterno-mastoid should be remembered in tenotomy of that muscle. It varies in size inversely with that of the external jugular vein. The Internal Jugular Vein receives the blood from the cranial cavity. It begins at the enlarged sinus or bulb of the sigmoid sinus, which is lodged in the large dorsal compartment of the jugular foramen.

(Testut.) course it ends behind the sternal end of the clavicle, where it joins the subclavian vein to form the innominate vein. At the base of the skull it is behind and then becomes external to the internal carotid artery. Lower down it lies external to and in the same sheath with the common carotid artery, overlapping it below, especially on the left side. A pair of imperfect valves is found about an inch above its termination. It has the following lateral tributaries. The inferior petrosal sinus opens into the bulb or into the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The pharyngeal plexus, on the outer surface of the pharynx, receives the blood from the neighboring ])arts, and opens into the jugular vein directly or through the common facial vein. It commimicates above with the pterygoid plexus anti receives branches trom the soft palate and Eustachian tube. The lingual vein (Fig. 494). Two small vense comites usually accompany the lingual artery, but most of the blood is returned from the tongue by the ranine

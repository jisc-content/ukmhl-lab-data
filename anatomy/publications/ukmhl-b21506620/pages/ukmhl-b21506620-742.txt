THE RECTUM. The rectum (Figs. 791, 792) begins at the point where the large intestine ceases to be provided with a mesentery, that is, in general, at the front of the third sacral vertebra in the middle line. Its name, which means " straight," is Fig. 791,â€”Sagittal section of the lower part of a male trunk, the right segment. (Testut.) made le.ss absurd by the adoption of our present plan of delimitation of the intes- tines in this region, than it was when this segment was made to start at the sacro- iliac joint; for then it was crooked from every point of view, while now, wlicn looked at from in front, it comes near deserving its title. It occupies the middle line, and is divided into an upper part, which is fur- nished with a covering of peritoneum, and a lower, which is not. The upper jjcirt, about three inches long, extends from the third sacral vertebra to the tip of the coccyx, and its shape conforms to the curve of these bones, to which it is attached behind. The lower part, shorter than the upper, is continued with the same dorsoventral curve, and terminates in a forward pouch, which is close to the prostate gland in the male and to the lower part of the vagina in the female.

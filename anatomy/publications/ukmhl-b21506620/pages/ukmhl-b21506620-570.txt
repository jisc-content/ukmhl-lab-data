THE CEBEBliO-SPINAL AXIS. 660 infundibulura. The presence of this fold acoounts for the fact that the hypo- physis is usually torn away when the brain is removed. The arteries of the dura are branches of the occipital, vertebral, ascending pharyngeal, internal maxillary, internal carotid, and ()|)lithalmic. The Pia, formerly called pia mater ("affectionate mother"), consists of blood- vessels arranged in the form of a membrane, and supported by areolar tissue. It is the nourishing tunic of the brain, and lies close to its surface everywhere, dipping down to the bottom of every fissure, and sending the branches of its arteries into the nervous substance. It is prolonged onto the roots of the nerves, and becomes continuous with their connective-tissue sheath. The velum inter- positum and choroid plexuses, already described, are pial structures. The Arachnoid (" like a spider's web") is a thin, delicate membrane, situated between the pia and tlie dura, much nearer the latter, and, for the most part, sub- stantially parallel with it. It does not follow the pia into the fissures, except the great longitudiual. The external surface of the arachnoid is furnished with a FALX CEREBRI Fig. 623.â€”The arachnoid at the base of the brain. Tlir ineiiiljrune lias been peeled off from the left hemi- sphere. (Testut.) single layer of flattened epithelial cells, which is continuous with the lamina of similar cells on the inner surface of the dura. Between them is a little serous fluid. Thus we have the elements of a serous memljrane, and it is proper to con- sider the ai'achnoid such. The interval between the dura and the arachnoid is the subdural space or arachnoid cavity. It is crossed obliquely by little fibrous bundles, which connect the two membranes. The cavity is normally merely virtual, its opposite sides being in contact; but it may become actual in disease. The under surflice of the arachnoid is connected with the outer surface of the

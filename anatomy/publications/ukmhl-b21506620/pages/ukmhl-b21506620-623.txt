THE CIRCUMFLEX NEB VE. 613 The superficial terminal branch of the ulnar nerve (1. th., or 8. c. 1. th.) behaves similarly to the median nerve, with which it communicates; but it supplies no muscles. It is distributed to the little and inner side of the ring finger. The deep branch (8. c.) accompanies the deep branch of the ulnar artery Fig. 662.â€”Cutaneous nerves of the dorsum of the hand. (Testut.) between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti. It supplies all the short muscles of the little finger, all the interos.sei, the inner two lumbricals, and those thumb muscles, which are on the inner side of the flexor longus poUicis. 9. The Circumflex Nerve. The circumflex nerve (5. 6. c.) (Figs. 658, 664, 666, 667) is one of the terminal divisions of the posterior cord. It turns round the lower border of the sub- scapularis, and accompanies the posterior circumflex artery to the back of the shoulder, through the quadrilateral space, bounded by the subscapularis, teres major, triceps, and the surgical neck of the humerus. It gives an articular twig to the shoulder-joint, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch winds round the humerus with the posterior circumflex artery, and sends many branches into the anterior part of- the deltoid, some of which reach the skin. The posterior branch sends a nerve to the teres minor, which has an ovoid, gangliform swelling on it, and sup])lies the posterior part of the deltoid muscle and skin over the lower deltoid region.

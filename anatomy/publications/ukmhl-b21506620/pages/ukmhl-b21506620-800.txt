THE URINARY SYSTEM. 788 The Female Urethra. This tube (Fig. 857) begins at the meatus urinarius internus in the bladder, and ends at the meatus urinarius externus in the vulva. It runs downward and Fig. 8.')7.—The female uretlira and surrounding parts seen in sagittal section. (Testut.) a little forward, curving with the concavity in front. It is about one inch and a half long, and its lumen is about a quarter inch across. It is situated directly in front of, and is closely associated with, the lower part of the anterior wall of the vagina, through Avhich it can be easily felt. Its external orifice is the naiTowest part, and is located between the clitoris and the opening of the vagina. The front and rear surfaces of the tube are in contact. The lining is a pale mucous mend)rane, and it is gathered into small, longi- tudinal folds (Fig. 858). Its epithelium is flattened and stratified, except at the uppermost part, where it is transi- tional ; its corium is beset with small papillae, which are most nu- merous near the lower end. Mu- cous trlands are abundant. The submucous coat is areolar, and contains an unusual proportion of yellow fibrous tissue. Outside of this is the muscular tunic in two layers, an internal longitudinal, and an external circular. At the vesical end of the tube the circular fasciculi are particularly numer- ous, and form a ring, which is erroneously called the sphincter of the bladder, but is properly named the internal spJiincter of the urethra. Between the muscular layers are scattered many elastic Fig. 858.—The female urethra, seen in coronal section. flKj-es In both lavci'S and es- (Testut.) .

THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. 562 and intervening sharp projections. From the appearance thus produced this structure has been called the ligamentum denticulatum ("toothed ligament"). The projections are attached to the dura between the places where the spinal nerves perforate that membrane. The Arachnoid lies near the dura and far from the cord, and, consequently, the subdural space is small and the subarachnoid is large. The latter space has few trabeculse as compared with that of the brain ; but a dorsal median partition, the septum posterius, passes from the arachnoid to the pia, giving passage to vessels. The space is crossed also by the ligamenta denticulata.

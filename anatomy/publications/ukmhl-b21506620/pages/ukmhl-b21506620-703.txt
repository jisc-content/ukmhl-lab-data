THE EYE. 693 and outer palpebral ligaments. The former, which is much the stronger and more marked, is often called the tendo oculi. It is attached to the nasal process of the superior maxilla in front of the lachrymal groove, and to the ridge on the lachrymal bone. Between these points it arches round the front and outer walls of the lachrymal sac. Where the two tarsi blend into this ligament it gives origin to the palpebral portion of the orbicularis muscle, and when tiiis muscle contracts, closing the lids, it produces an enlargement of the cavity of tlie lachrymal sac thus causing it to suck in the tears from the lacus lachrymalis. To the upper edge Fig. 740.â€”Upper lid in sagittal section. (After Merkel.) of the superior tarsus is attached the wide tendon of the levator palpebrse, and to the lower edge of the inferior tarsus a fibrous expansion from the sheath of the inferior rectus. Embedded in the deep surface of each tarsus are the Meibomian glands, longer and more numerous in the upper lid than in the lower. On everting the eyelid they may be noticed as faint pearly lines running lieneath the conjunctiva toward the free margin of the lid. They are a variety of sebaceous glands and their secretion prevents any adhesion between the lids, and keeps the tears from floAviug over onto the face until considerably heaped up in the palpebral aperture. The Conjunctiva (Fig. 741). The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane, which, as before stated, lines the inner surface of the eyelids {palpebral covjmictiva) and is reflected from them onto the surface of the eyeball (ocular conjunctiva). The fold of reflection is the con-

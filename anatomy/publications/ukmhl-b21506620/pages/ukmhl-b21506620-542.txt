532 THE CEItEBBO-SPINAL AXIS. The Thalami (Figs. 587, 588). The thalami, often called thalami opiici (" optic couches "), are large masses of gray substance of irregular shape, presenting mesial, upper, and back surfaces, FORAMEN OF MONRO ANTERIOR COMMISSURE OPTIC NERVE INFUNDIBULUM posterior 'commissure hypophysis Fig. 587.—Median section through the third and fourth ventricles.

The free surfaces are covered with a thin layer of white nervous tissue. The mesial surface of each is flattened, and forms T/ENIA SEMI- CIRCULARIS Fig. .588.—Third ventricle frrim above. The upper surface of the thalami, the epiphysis, and the corpora quadrigemina are seen. (Testut.) a side wall of the third ventricle from floor to roof. The boundary between the mesial and upper surfaces is marked by a white band, the stalk of the epiphysis, extending from the anterior pillar of the fornix in front to the epiphysis behind.

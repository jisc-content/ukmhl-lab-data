THE BONES. 172 It forms part of the temporal fossa, and is dclimitecl from the mastoid surface behind by the curved mpramastoid crest. This crest is continued forward, just above the external auditory meatus, to the zygoma (" yoke "), a process of bone which projects, shelf-like, from the lower part of this surface outward, and then, twisted on itself, continues forward. In its forward projection the smooth inner Fig. 192.—The right temporal bone, outer surface. (Testut.) surface and lower border give origin to the masseter, the sharp upper border attaches the temporal fascia, and the serrated and bevelled anterior extremity articulates with the malar. Two ridges, or roots, extend from its base, the })0s- terior backwai'd and the anterior inward, enclosing between them a transversely oval, smooth depression, the glenoid fossa, divided into two parts by the nearly Fig. 193.—The right temporal bone, viewed from the mesial plane. (Testut.) transverse fissure of Glaser. For articulation with the lower jaw the front lialf of the fossa is coated with cartilage, together with the convex nearly transverse ridge, the eminentia articularis, wliich limits it in front and forms the anterior root of the zygoma. At the outer end of the latter root is a tubercle (preglenoid)

641 THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES. the visceral branches of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves may be classed in the same category, though most of these join the subsidiary plexuses and not the gangliated cords. Fig. 689.—Cutaneous nerves of the sole. (\V. Keil- Fig. 690.—Areas of distribution of the cutaneous ler.) nerves of the sole. (W. Keiller.) The non-medullatcd nerves commence as axis-cylinder processes of the gan- glion cells. Some are distributed in gray rami communicantes to spinal nerves, and in them reach the vessels, fascia;, bones, etc., for which they are destined ; ACCOMPANYING DORSAL ROOT TO DURA ^DORSAL SPINAL NERVE ROOT TO HIGHER GANGLIA TO VERTEBR/E LIGAMENTS, SPINAL VESSELS 4.

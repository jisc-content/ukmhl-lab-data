THE ARTERIES. 441 in front of the vessels, and between the vastus interniis on the outer side and adductor magnus and longus on the inner, forms its anterior boundary, and the muscles named make its other sides. Superficial to the canal is the sartorius muscle. Variations.—The femoral may be very small, and terminate in the upper part of the thigh ; and the lower limb in such cases receives its blood supply in large part from a very large sciatic artery. The femoral has been seen to divide into two vessels and then unite to form a single popliteal. Variations in branches are frequently noted. The circumflex arteries, one w both, are sometimes derived from the common femoral instead of from the profunda. The profunda is some- times given oft" from the inner side of the vessel instead of the outer side. Surgical Anatomy (Fig. 478).—The femoral artery is, of course, ligated in Fig. 478.—Surgical relations of the femoral artery. (Kocher.) amputations of the upper two-thirds of tlic thigh, and the exact position of this vessel and its branches should \w studied in cross-sections of the thigh. The student is advised to make sketches of such transverse sections at various levels, and learn in this way the relations of the structures as they present themselves in

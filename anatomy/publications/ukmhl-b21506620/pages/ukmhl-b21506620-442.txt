THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. 432 gives off a spinal branch, which furnishes branches to the spinal cord and mem- branes and to the lumbar vertebrae. The abdominal branch passes either in front of or behind the quadratus himltorum muscle to the muscles of the abdominal walls, winds forward, and anastomoses with the intercostal arteries and branches from the external iliac, which supply the walls of the abdomen. Variations of the lumbar arteries are not common. Two or more of the arteries are at times found to arise by a common trunk. Surgical Anatomy.—In the operations to expose the kidney by lumbar incision, the position of the lumbar arteries should be remembei'ed. The Sacra Media (middle sacral) artery arises from the lower end of the abdominal aorta, passes down the middle line of the last lumbar vertebra and sacrum, and to the tip of the coccyx, where it terminates in the structure known as Luschka's gland. It anastomoses freely in front of the sacrum with the lateral sacral arteries, and gives some branches to the rectum. Variations.—The middle sacral is sometimes a branch from a lumbar artery, sometimes from the common iliac. Surgical Anatomy.—In the operation known as Kraske's operation, where the lower portion of the sacrum is removed, this artery is to be regarded. THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES (Figs. 470, 474). The common iliac arteries take their origin from the aorta where it bifurcates opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra. They pass downward and outward behind INTERNAL PUDIc' FiG. 474.—External and internal iliac arteries. (Testut.) the peritoneum to the articulation between the last lumbar vertebra and the sac- rum, and divide into the external and internal iliac arteries. The Relations of the common iliac arteries differ on the two sides, owing to the fact that the common iliac veins both pass to the ascending vena cava, Avhich is to the right of the aorta.

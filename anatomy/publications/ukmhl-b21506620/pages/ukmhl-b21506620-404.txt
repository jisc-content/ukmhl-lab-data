Course and termination : it runs at first upward and inward, and then curves downward and inward beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles to the upper portion of the laterariobe of the thyroid ^laud, to Avhich it is distributed. Relations.—The superior thyroid at its origin is superficially situated and covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia ; before it reaches W Fig. 446.—Surgical relations of the external carotid, lingual, facial, occipital, subclavian, and transversalis colli arteries.

Surgical Anatomy.—The superior thyroid can be ligated close to its origin from the external carotid through the same incision described in ligating the external carotid in the lower part of its course. This operation is sometimes done to limit the blood-supply of an enlarged thyroid gland, or in cases of exophthalmic goitre. The artery is ligated in the operation of extirpation of the thyroid.

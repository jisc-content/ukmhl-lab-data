647 THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES. and distribution to the branches of that vessel. Of these plexuses the hepatic and coronary are joined by branches of the left pneumogastric, and the splenic plexus is reinforced from the right pneumogastric. The superior mesenteriG plcxm is derived from tlie solar plexus, suiierior mesenteric ganglion, and right pneumogastric. It is distributed to the intestine, at first following the branches of its artery closely; but its finer filaments leave the vessels. The aortic plexus is formed of two cords and an intervening network, which descend on the abdominal aorta beneath the superior mesenteric artery. It is Fig. 694.—Lower half of right sympathetic cord. (Testut, after Hirschfeld.) joined by branches from the lumbar ganglia, gives off the inferior mesenteric plexus and branches to the spermatic plexus and inferior vena cava, and ends below in the hypogastric plexus. The inferior mescnferic plexus is derived from the aortic. It corresponds in distribution and communications with the artery of the same name. The Hi/pof/astrie I-'lexus.—Branches from the aortic plexus descend on the aortic bifurcation to the front of the fifth lumbar vertebra, where they are joined by strong fibres from the lower lumbar sympathetic ganglia, which cross over the common iliac arteries. These form together in front of the fifth lumbar vertebra a coarse meshwork invested in dense fibrous tissue, called the hypogastric plexus.

THE 3IUSCLES. 334 of the fibres of these muscles to each other contributes greatly to the strength of the abdominal wall, and is a safeguard against hernia. Quadratus Lumborum (Fig. 325).—" The square muscle of the loins." Situa- tion, in the hind wall of the abdomen. Origin, the back part of the inner lip of the iliac crest, the ilio-lumbar ligament, and the transverse processes of several lower lumbar vertebrse. Diyedion, upward. Insertion, the last rib and the trans- verse processes of several upper lumbar vertebrse. Action, depression of last rib, and lateral flexion of spine. Nerves, the last thoracic and the upper lumbar. THE MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. Diaphragma. Levatores costarum. Intercostales externi. Triangularis sterni. Intercostales interni. Subcostales. Diaphragma (Figs. 398, 399).—''The diaphragm," meaning etymologically " a partition." Synonym, the niidrifF. The diaphragm is the septum between Fig. 398.—Diaphragm, viewed from in front. (Testut.) the two great cavities of the trunk, forming the convex floor of the thorax and the vaulted roof of the abdomen. Its tendon is centrally located, and is, conse- quently, its highest part; and to this the muscular portion, which is peripheral, rises from its extensive origin at the lower boundaries of the thoracic framework —the sternum, some costal cartilages, several vertebrse, and certain fibrous bands between these vertebrse and the last rib. From the front of the bodies of the upper two lumbar vertebrse (on the right side one or two more) and the related cartilages rise two processes, called crura, which unite and arch over the aorta just below the last thoracic vertebra, the mesial fibres crossing to the opposite side. From the body of the first lumbar vertebra springs a fibrous band, which arches over to the tip of the transverse process, and from this point to the last rib a second band is stretched. The first

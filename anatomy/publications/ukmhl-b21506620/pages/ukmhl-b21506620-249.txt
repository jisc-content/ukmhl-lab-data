THE ANKLE-JOINT. 239 4. The Ankle-joint (Figs. 256, 257). The ankle is a hinge-joint, in which the articular surfaces of the lower end and internal malleolus of the tibia and of the external malleolus of the fibula form a mortice, into which the upper and lateral facets of the astragalus fit as a tenon. The transverse ligament helps to complete the tibio-fibular socket behind. The capsule, strengthened and protected by the strong tendons passing over it, is divided, for description, into the following ligaments : The internal lateral or deltoid ligament is a strong, flat, triangular band which radiates from the lower and ventral borders of the internal malleolus downward and backward to the rough inner surface of the astragalus, downward to the sustentacu- lum tali of the os calcis, and downward and forward to the navicular and the margin of the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. A so-called deep portion descends from the notch on the lower border of the malleolus to the depression on the inner surface of the astragalus. The external lateral ligament presents three separate diverging bands : 1. The Fig. 257.â€”Tibio-tarsal articulation, outer side. The cavity is artificiallj- distended. (Testut.) anterior fasciculus, short and ril)bon-like, passes from the ventral border of the external malleolus obliquely forward and upward to the astragalus, in front of its external lateral facet. 2. The 7H/r/(//e/a.sc/eu/H.s, strong and round, descends slightly backward from the tip and the fore part of the outer surface of the external mal- leolus to the middle of the outer surface of the os calcis. 3.

The Iliohypogastric Nerve. The iliohypogastric nerve (Figs. 672, (578) rises in comjnon with the ilioinguinal from the first lumbar, and occasionally blends with it to form one nerve. Emerging from the outer border of the psoas it crosses the quadratus in the sub- peritoneal areolar tissue, and enters the space between the transversalis and iuter- LUMBAR PORTION APONEUROSIS OF Ex- DORSAL NERVE TERNAL OBLIQUE OF PENIS Fig. 672â€”Deep and superficial dissection of the lumbar plexus.

Continuing onward the nerve pierces the internal oblique near the iliac spine, and becomes cutaneous about an inch above the external abdominal ring. Its iliac branch pierces the abdominal muscles and, like the corresponding

(4) Between the memhrana granulosa and the tunica propria there appears a thin structureless membrane, the memhrana propria. The largest follicles are from to A an inch or more in diameter. Their increased size is due mainly to an increase of the liquor folliciili. In this stage the memhrana granulosa and discus proligerus each consists of several layers of Fig. 892.—Graafian follicles, in different stages of development. Diagrammatic. (Testut.) cells, derived by proliferation from the pre-existing cells. In the external layer, that is next to the tunica propria and the ovum, the cells retain their columnar outline, but the remaining layers are composed of irregular or rounded cells. Origin.—In early foetal life, the ovary is represented by a cellular mass derived from the peritoneal cover of the Wolffian body, and called the germinal epifhelium. Among the small cells of which it is composed are certain larger, spherical, nucleated cells, the primordial ova. Soon, from the fibrous stroma beneath the epithelium, prolongations of connective tissue grow into the mass of cells ; and coincidently the cells, themselves becoming involuted at certain points, grow into the stroma. In this way irregular tubes lined with polyhedral or rounded cells are formed. Later, bands of stroma grow across these tubes and divide them into nests of cells. These nests are the future Graafian follicles, and each contains at least one primordial ovum. From the smaller cells are developed the memhrana granulosa and discus proligerus. By about the seventh month of intra-uterine life these prf)cesses cease, and thereafter the ovary is covered by the single layer of epitlielium already descrilied. Location.—Tlie smallest follicles are found in the outer layer of the cortical zone of the ovary, where they are so numerous as to impart to this region a granu- lar appearance. Many of these never develop. The larger follicles (ten to twenty in each ovary) occupy the deeper laver of the cortical zone. The largest and most mature follicles are in contact witli the medullary substance and nourished by its rich vascular supply. Extending entirely across the cortical layer, they project from the surface of the ovary in tlie form of clear vesicles, 2V ^ of an inch in diameter. At puberty a certain number of follicles become enlarged, and from that time until the climacteric new ones are being constantly developed. Structure of the Ova.—The human ovum in the primordial stage is about YTjinr of an inch in diameter, in the mature stage its diameter is inci'eased to j^q- of an inch. It is developed from a nucleated cell and presents the following parts : (1) an outer covering representing the cell wall, and called the zona peJ- lucida or vitelline membrane; (2) Avithin this a mass of protoplasm, the vitellus or

838 THE ORGANS OF GENERATION. The Mons Veneris. The mons Veneris is an elevation situated in front of tlie upper part of the pubic sympliysis. Anteriorly and above, it merges into the integument covering the lower part of the abdomen, posteriorly it is continuous with the labia majora, laterally it is limited by the right and left inguinal folds. In structure the mons consists of modified skin, deeply pigmented, and covered with hair, beneath which is a collection of areolar and adipose tissue, intersected by a series of MONS VENERIS Fit;. 899.â€”Vulva of a virgin. The labia have been widely separated. (Te.stut.) elastic laminae. The latter take origin deeply from the linea alba and abdominal aponeurosis, and end by becoming attached to the deep surface of the skin. The Labia Majora. The labia majora ("greater lips"), two longitudinal folds of modified integu- ment, are continuous with the mons Veneris in front, and extend to within an inch of the anus behind. Each fold is about three inches in length, and presents for description two extremities, two surfaces, and two borders. The anterior extremities by their junction with the mons and with each other make up the anterior commissure; the posterior, having become very thin, are united by the posterior commissui'e or fourchette (" fork "), wdiich constitutes the thin, anterior edge of the perineum. The outer surface, separated from the corresponding thigh by the genito-crural fold, is deeply pigmented, covered with hair, and abundantly supplied with sudoriparous and sebaceous glands ; the inner is in con- tact, when closed, in part with its fellow, in part with the labium minus of the same side. The skin, which lines this surface in the vicinity of the free border, resembles that on the outer surface; more deeply it is rosy, moist, studded with

659 THE SKIN. The Sweat-Glands (Fig. 695). Except in the depths of the external auditoiy meatus and on the tympanic membrane, sweat-glands are found over the whole integument. They are most numerous on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, 2800 to the square inch ; on the back of the neck and trunk there are only 400 to 600 in the same area. They vary much in size, being largest in the axilla and groin. Krause estimates their total number as about two millions. A siceat-gland is an invaginated, epithelial tube, which sinks through the cer- ium into the subcutaneous fatty tissue, and there coils up into a ball. Thus it is a simple tubular gland, the coiled-up extremity being the secreting portion, the straight tube its excretory duct. In the epidermis the duct is a simple channel witli no definite walls, and where the horny layer is thick it twists in cork-screw fashion. As it passes through the coi'ium, the duct derives from it a richly vascular filjrous coat, within which is a basement membrane. The duct, much smaller tlian the coiled, secreting portion of the tube, is lined by small poly- liedral cells, two deep, whose free surface is condensed into an appearance sug- gesting a delicate cuticle. In the secreting segwevt a layer of smooth muscular fibres, longitudinally arranged, is placed next the basement membrane, and on this a single layer of columnar cells with nuclei near their attached extremities. The ceruminous glands of the ear and the glands of Moll in the eyelid are modi- fied sweat-glands. The sweat-glands in the axilla and round the anus and, of course, the ceruminous glands have an oily secretion; the rest secrete a colorless, slightly turbid, aqueous fluid, the perspiration.

They are often called the fundamental tracts, or ground tracts of their respective columns ; but a simpler and more instructive name is the ventro-lateral associa- tion tract—an appellation which indicates at once the location and the service of the structure, whose function is to connect parts of the cord situated at different levels. The association tracts are found in the whole length of the cord, and are subject to but slight variations of size. In the dorsal column are two tracts, separated from each other by a line run- ning from the dorso-intermediate fissure to a point near the junction of the neurogliar septum and the gray commissure. These tracts, then, correspond exactly to the dorso-mesial and the dorso-lateral columns, and are called respec- FiG. 617.—DiaKram to show the crossing of the pyramids Fk;.

The Goll tract increases in size as it ascends; the Burdach tract varies but little from its average at different levels. Finally, at the dorso-lateral fissure is a small irregular area, the warr/inal bundle, called also by the names of the men who simultaneously described it, the Spitzlca-Llssauer tract.

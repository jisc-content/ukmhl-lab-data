558 THE CEREBROSPINAL AXIS. The Membranes of the Brain. The Dura, formerly called dnra mater ("severe mother"), is a strong, thick membrane, composed of white fibrous tissue with a small admixture of yellow fibres, and lodging a great number of blood-vessels. It is arranged in two layers, whicii are closely united in most parts, the outer one being decidedly the more vascular. Externally the dura is firmly adherent to the inner surface of the bones which form the brain-case, and is for them the internal periosteum, known as endoemnium (" within the cranium "). When the dura is peeled oif from the bones its outer surface is seen to be flocculeut, owing to the vessels which pass from it into the bone being pulled partly out of the channels in which they were lodged, and torn off, and to the similar treatment of certain small, fibrous pro- cesses of the membrane. The endocranium is continuous with the pericranium at the margin of the various holes which perforate the skull. The dura extends outward through the basal foramina, and becomes continuous with the areolar sheath of the nerves which pass through them. Several broad prolongations of the dura extend from the periphery toward the centre of the cavity of the brain-case. In their formation the inner layer of SINUS ' Fig. 621.â€”The tentorium, viewed from above. (Testut.) the dura separates from the outer along a definite line and projects centrally. Presently it comes in contact with a corresponding and opposite plate, which has been formed in the same manner, and the two blend, and, thus united, stretch toward the centre as a strong, partial partition. At the attached border of these shelf-like structures is left a prismoid space, whose base is bounded by the outer layer of the dura, and its sides by the prolongations from the inner layer. These spaces are lined by an extension from tlie tunica intima of the veins, and thus constitute the venous sinuses, already described.

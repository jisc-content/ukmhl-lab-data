THE BONES. 122 ments, and ends in a projection, the inferior lafcral angle, below which there is a notch, converted into a foramen by ligaments from the coccyx. Through this foramen passes the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. The sacral spinal canal curves and narrows with the bone. It is triangular above on trans- verse section, flattened or semilunar below, and lodges the lower end of the cauda equina and fjlum terminale with the spinal dura. Peculiarities and Varieties.—The second and third sacral vertebrae represent the sacrum of mammals—the fourth and fifth the first two caudal vertebi'je, while the first represents the sixth lumbar of most quadrupeds. This explains the occasional partial or complete separation, and the transitional and ])artly lumbar character of the first sacral, not rarely present. The large number of sacral vertebrje in man is associated with his upright position. The sacrum some- times consists of six segments, more rarely of only four. In the former instance the first coccygeal is usually included. The breadth of the sacrum as compared with its length is re- markably great in man as compared with mammals, and especially so in the European specimens. The sacrum, its right side. THE COCCYX. The coccyx^ (Fig. 144) consists of four, but sometimes of five and rarely of three, rudimentary vertebrae. These consist of little else than bodies tapering in size from above doAvnward, so as to give the bone a triangular outline. They are ankylosed together, and oftentimes with the sacrum, in advanced life ; but in middle life, especially in the female, the first is movable on the succeeding three and on the fifth sacral, with which it is united l)y fibro-cartilage. ' Named from its resemblance to a cuckoo's beak.

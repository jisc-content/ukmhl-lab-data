They terminate in arboriza- tions round the cells of the vertebral ganglia, or pass through these without interruption to enter into relationshij) with the cells of the prevertebral plexuses.

Medullated nerves (forming white rami communicantes) are not furnished to the sympathetic cords by all the cerebro-spinal nerves. In man white rami com- mimicantes are derived from the thoracic and the first (and perhaps the second) lum- bar nerves ; while the short root of the ciliary ganglion from the third nerve, the visceral branches of the facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory, and

The elongation continuing, the loop Fig. 101.—Diagram of the human mesentery in its primitive relations. (C. S. Minot.) bends upon itself, that portion of the intestine which will become the transverse colon passing over the portion which is to become the duodenum. During the elongation of the intestine the edge of the dorsal mesentery which is attached to it undergoes a corresponding increase in length, while at the line of attachment to the body-wall it increases but slightly, the mesentery of the loop in conse- quence assuming a fan-like form, and, when the twisting of the loop supervenes, becoming funnel-like. By this time a differentiation of the intestinal tube has occurred, the portion of it above the loop becoming enlarged to form the stomach, while the portion of the loop which passes transversely across the abdominal cavity and the portion of the intestine below this becomes the large intestine. The cceeum develops as an outgrowth from the large intestine at the point where it is joined by the small intestine, and the vermiform aiypendix is an outgrowth from the caecum.

(Hertwig.) further changes in the intestine consist principally of a continued elongation, especially of the small intestine, and of the occurrence of fusion and degeneration of certain portions of the mesentery. Thus, the mesentery attached to the trans- verse colon, primarily radiating from the apex of the mesenterial funnel, later

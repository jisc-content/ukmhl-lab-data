770 THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. The middle crico-thyroid ligament (Fig. 833) connects in front the upper border of the cricoid with the h)wer border of the thyroid. On each side this ligament is prolonged backward as the lateral erico-thyroid ligament (Figs. 834, 835), which is attached below to the upper margin of the cricoid, but above, instead of running to the opposed edge of the thyroid, it slopes inward in its upward course, and is attached in front to the Fig. 834.—Diagram of coronal section of lateral crico-thyroid Fig. 835.—Diagram of sagittal sec- ligaments.

From its connections it would be more descriptively named crico-thl^^o-arytenoid. Its free margin, stretching between the thyroid and the arytenoid, is often called the inferior thyro- arytenoid ligament. This last is thick, flattened toward the middle line, and sharp on the upjjer edge. Covered with mucous membrane it constitutes one of the true vocal cords (Fig. 836). Close to the inferior is the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament, arising a little above it on the thyroid, and inserted upon the ridge on the front surface of the arytenoid. It is small, and with its covering of mucous membrane forms the upper or false vocal cord (Fig. 836). APEX OF SUP.

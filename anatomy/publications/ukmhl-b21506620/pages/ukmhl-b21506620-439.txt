THE ARTERIES. 429 to left along the upper surface of the pancreas to the spleen, where it breaks up into a number of branches which enter the hilum and supply that organ. Variations.—The splenic sometimes gives otf a hepatic branch to the left lobe of the liver, and, rai'ely, branches to the intestines. Surgical Anatomy.—The position of the splenic artery should be carefully studied with reference to the operation of removal of the spleen. The fact that the artery does not enter the spleen as a single trunk, but as several branches, and often that these vessels enter the spleen at wide distances from each other, should be carefully noted. Branches of the splenic artery are the pancreatic, the short gastric, and the gastro-epiploica sinistra. The pancreatic are numerous branches supjilying the pancreas ; one large trunk accompanies the main duct of the pancreas from left to right, and is called the pancreatica magna. The short gastric, half a dozen ves- sels of small size, sn]ip]y the left extremity of the stomach. The gastro-epiploica sinistra winds along the great curvature of the stomach, and anastomoses with the gastro-epiploica dextra. The Superior Mesenteric (Fig. 472).—The superior mesenteric arises from the Fig. 472.—Superior mesenteric artery. (Testut.) anterior surface of the abdominal aorta below the coeliac axis and behind the pan- creas. It passes downward between the folds of the mesentery, and breaks up into branches which supply the small intestines, the ctecum, and the ascending and transverse colon. Variations.—The superior mesenteric sometimes gives off a hepatic liranch, and sometimes supplies the descending colon.

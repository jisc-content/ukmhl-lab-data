319 MUSCLES MOVING THE DIGITS OF THE FOOT. Extensor Proprius Hallucis (Figs. 381, 382, 362).—"The proper extensor of the great toe." Synonyms, extensor longus hallucis, extensor proprius pollicis, extensor longus pollicis pedis. " Proprius " is preferable to " longus " in naming this muscle, because extension of the great toe is partly eifected through the inner tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, a muscle not special (proprius) to F[(i. :?7'.).—Flexor accessorius and lumbricalcs Fig. 380.—Muscles of the superficial layer of the of right foot. (Tcstut.) right foot. (Testut.) this digit, but also concerned in extending three other toes. Situation, in the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot. Origin, the middle two-fourths of the anterior surface of the til)ula and adjacent part of the interosseous membrane. Direction, downward, through the annular ligament, then forward, inward, and a little downward. Insertion, the dorsum of the base of the last phalanx of the hallux. Action, extension of great toe. Nerve, the anterior tibial. Extensor Longus Digitorum (Figs. 362, 383).—" The long extensor of the digits," meaning the four small toes. Situation, in the front of the leg and dor- sum of the foot. Origin, the external tuberosity of the tibia, the head and two- thirds of the anterior surface of the fibula, and a little of the upper part of the interosseous membrane. Direction, downward through the annular ligament, then forward and a little downward. Insertion, by a tendon for each of the small toes. Each tendon divides into three parts, of which the middle is attached at the base of the second phalanx on its dorsal aspect, the lateral parts uniting and finding attachment at the base of the last phalanx. Action, extension of the four small toes. Nerve, the anterior tibial. Extensor Brevis Digitorum (Figs. 384, 381).—"The short extensor of the

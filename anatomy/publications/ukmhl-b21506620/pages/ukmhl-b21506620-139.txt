THE CLAVICLE. ]31 wide transvei'se diameter characteristic of man, throws the weight farther back, and makes easier the balance around the spinal axis in the erect position. The ribs are more and more oblique from above downward as far as the seventh or lower—a fact due in part to the increasing downward curvature from the head to the angle, and in part to the increasingly lower position of the trans- verse processes of the lower thoracic vertebrae. This increasing obliquity of the Fig. 154.—The skeleton of the thorax, dorsal view (Testut.) ribs makes the eleven intercostal spaces wider at the sides than behind. These .spaces contract again .somewhat in front from the third to the eighth. They are widest in the upper three spaces, and wider in inspiration than in expiration. It should be remembered that the circumfei'ence of the right half of the thorax is usually about half an inch larger than that of the left. Note that the lower pal- ])able end of the gladiolus is on a level with the lowest part of the fifth rib. At birth the thorax may measure even more from before backward than transversely, as is the ca.se with quadrupeds. This is due to the absence of the angles and to the less curvature of the ril)s at this period. In the female the thorax is rela- tively shorter, and deeper from before backward, though the latter diameter is actually less than in the male. THE BONES OF THE UPPER LIMB. The skeleton of the ujjper limb comprises the clavicle and scapula, forming the pectoral arch or shoulder-girdle, the humerus in the arm, the radius and ulna in the forearm, and the carpal, metacarpal, and phalangeal bones in the hand. THE CLAVICLE. The clavicle ("little key") or collar-bone (Figs. 155, 156) passes outward and backward from the top of the sternum to the acromion process of the scapula, and forms the connecting link between the trunk and the upper limb, affording a

7 PUBLISHERS' NOTE. Peehaps the obvious magnitude of such an undertaking as the present may be connected with the fact, often observed, that although America has enriched medical literature with systematic treatises on all other branches, its anatomical instruction has been derived from foreign works. The creation of another volume Avould, however, be justified neither by this fact alone, nor by the growing and natural wish of American readers for works by home authors. The very multi- plicity of books on Anatomy proves that the science is advancing in discoveries of fact, relationship, and methods of presentation, and moreover that no volume fidly satisfies all requirements. No effort has been spared by those responsible for this work to render it one in which Americans miglit take a justifiable pride, and which the fraternity of medicine abroad might equally welcome as a contribution to the advancement of a vital science. Text, illusti-ation, and typography represent the best endeavors in their respective kinds. For many of the engravings individual acknowledg- ment has been made to Testut's admirable Traite de VAnatoinie, published by M. Doin, of Paris, a Avork deserving wide recognition by English-speaking students. The series of illustrations in the present work is original to an unusual degree, and far more extensive than hitherto attempted. Colors have been abundantly employed, and particular care has been bestov/ed in engraving the labels of parts directly upon them wherever possible, whereby the student gains at a glance a knowledge of their names, position, and relations.

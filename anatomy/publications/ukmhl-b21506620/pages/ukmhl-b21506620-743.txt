THE LARGE INTESTINE. 733 If the lower opening of the alimentary canal were made at the end of this pouch, and in the line of its curve, the anus would be situated in the male just back of the attachment of the scrotum and in the female near the vaginal entrance. The curve of the rectum, thus extended, would present an even sweep from its Fig. 702.â€”Sagittal section of the lower part of a female trunk, right segment. (Te.stut.) upper to its lower end. The opening, however, is not thus placed, but is located in the under side of the rectum, considerably to the rear of its blunt end. The part of the intestine in front of this opening is called the rectal ampulla. The muscular coat is thick and sti'ong at all points, and consists of two layers, the external being the longitudinal, the internal the circular, and both evenly spread. The serous tunic covers only a portion of the first part, and none of the second. This coat is most extensive in front, and is absent behind ; and the line at which it leaves the gut slopes from above downward and forward very rapidly. It is reflected onto the bladder in the male, and the vault of the vagina and the uterus in the female. Whei'e there is no serous coat the rectum is covei'ed with strong areolar tissue. The mucous membrane is thicker and denser than that of the colon, and its luie deepens to a decided red in the lower part.

THE ARTERIES. 389 right brachio-cephalic vein and the pneumogastric nerve are to the right of the vessel, and the pleura and trachea are behind. In passing an aneurism-needle it is best ])assed from the right to the left behind the vessel, care being taken to avoid injury to the pneumogastric nerve, the bi'achio-eephalic veins, and the pleura. Eranclies.â€”In addition to the terminal branches, the right common carotid and right subclavian, the brachio-cephalic occasionally gives oft' a branch, the fhyroidea hna, whicli passes upward on the surface of the trachea to the isthmus of the thyroid gland, and the occasional presence of this branch should be remembered in the operations of removal of the thyroid gland, and in low tracheotomy. The common carotid arteries (Fig. 443) differ upon the two sides. The right takes its origin from the brachio-cephalic, the left from the arch of the aorta ; the left is, therefore, the longer of the two. In the neck the common carotids are so nearly alike that one description will answer for both. It will be necessary, how- ever, to describe that portion of the left carotid which extends from the arch to the sterno-clavicular articulation. The Left Carotid Artery in the Thorax. This portion resembles somewhat the brachio-cephalic artery in length and in its relation to surrounding structure. Relations. In front. Sternum. Sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid.

THE COMMON CAROTIDS IN THE NECK. Origin, opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation from the brachio-cephalic on the right side, and from the thoracic portion of the common carotid on the left. Course, upward and outward in a line drawn between the sterno-clavicular articulation and a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. The vessel is covered by the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, the inner border of which is a good guide to its course.

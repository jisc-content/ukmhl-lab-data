The capsule is composed of longitudinal fibres, with some oblique and circular fibres interwoven, and is strongest on its superior aspect. It is so lax Fig. 238.—Shoulder-joint, rear view. The hind part of the capsular ligament and most of the head of the humerus have been removed. (Testut.) that alone it does not keep the bones in contact. Above and behind the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, in front that of the sub- scapularis and belo^v the long head of the triceps are intimately connected with and strengthen the capsule. Between the subscapularis and triceps tendons is an Fig. 239.—Shoulder-joint, front view. (Testut.) unprotected and weak part of the capsule, usually torn by the passage of the head in dislocations, to which the shoulder is very liable, owing in part to the looseness of its capsule. Besides the overlying tendons the capsule has two sets of acces- sory folds. (1) The eoraco-humeral ligament extends as a strong, broad band from the outer border and root of the coracoid process, beneath the coraco-acromial liga- ment, obliquely over the joint to the anatomical neck of the humerus above the great tuberosity, being intimately connected with the capsule. Seen from in front, it appears as a fan-shaped i)roc('ss lying over and above the capsule, with which it

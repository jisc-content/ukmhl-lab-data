THE CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. By F. H. GERRISH. THE great nervous mass which occupies the main cavity of the cranium is known as the cncephalon ("in the head") or brain ; and the prolongation of this, which is lodged in the canal made by the vertebrae and the cartilaginotis plates between them, is called the mydon (" marrow ") or spinal cord. Radiating from these structures are many cords, called nerves; and this fact suggested the name axis for these combined central the distinguishing Fig. 527.—Semidiagrammatio view the cerebro-spinal axis, left side. of (Testut.) ^ y © Fig. 528.—Diagram of the conversion of the dorsal groove into a canal. adjective cerebro-spinal, which is usually asso- ciated with the noun, deriving its first part from " cerebrum," which is the most conspicuous portion of the encephalon, and its last part from the column of bones in which the myelon is located (Fig. 627).

One tube enlarges into a sac, and this develops into the enceph- alon (Fig. 529). The remainder of the tube becomes the spinal cord. The cavity of the encephalon is always con- tinuous with that of the spinal cord. Great changes take place in both parts, especially in the encephalon ; but throughout these modifications, cer- tain things are almost invariable. In nearly all of the amazing complications of encephalic growth, three things remain as in the simplest form of encephalon in the embryo : (1) a cavity-wall of nervous tissue ; (2) a 499 Fig. 529.—Diagram of first stage of axial cavity.

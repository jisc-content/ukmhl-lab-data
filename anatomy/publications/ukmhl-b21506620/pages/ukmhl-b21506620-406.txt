396 THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM. and deep fascia are divided, and the submaxillary gland is exposed and drawn upward. Beneath the submaxillary gland the digastric tendon is exposed, running upward in each direction to its anterior and posterior belly respectively. Above this tendon is seen the hypoglossal nerve; between the nerve and tendon the hyoglossus muscle is exposed. The fibres of this muscle are separated, and, running parallel with the nerve but beneath it, the lingual artery comes into view. The ranine artery may be ligated by di\'iding the mucous membrane of the lower surface of the tongue parallel with and external to the raphe. Branches of the lingual are the hyoid, dorsal lingual, sublingual, and ranine. The hyoid runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone. The dorsal Ungual runs upward to the mucous membrane of the dorsum of the tongue, which it supplies. The sublingual supplies the sublingual gland. The ranine gives off* branches to the muscles of the tongue, and runs in a toi'tuous course to its tip, being in the last part of its course superficial, covered only by the mucous mem- brane. The Facial Artery (Fig. 448).—Origin : from the anterior surface of the exter- nal carotid aliove the hyoid bone. Course and termination : the vessel passes upward and forward to the inferior border of the lower jaw. In its course it is Fig. 448.—Superficial arteries of the liead. (Testut.) covered by the submaxillary gland and partly surrounded by the gland, so that the vessel occupies a groove on its deep surface. The vessel winds over the body of the lower jaw in front of the masseter muscle, marking the bone in this posi- tion by a shallow groove. It then passes upward and forward on the face to the side of the nose, and from the side of the nose upward to the angle of the eye, where it terminates as the angular artery.

660 THE TONGUE. By F. H. GERRISH. EPIGLOTTIS THE tongue has various functions. It is necessary for articulate speech, per- forms valuable service in the processes of mastication and deglutition, possesses tactile sensibility to a high degree, and is the principal organ of taste. It is only in its sensory relations that it will be considered in this place. Its other features will be de- scribed in connection with the other parts of the mouth and pharynx. The mucosa of the dor- sum (Fig. 706) is the only part of the tongue having gustatory capacity. The anterior two-thirds of this surface presents in the mouth, the posterior third in the pharynx, the bound- ary between the two being marked by a line of large projections, the eircumval- late papillce, arranged like an inverted V, with widely spread branches. The oral part of the dorsum is besprinkled with smaller processes, the fungiform papillae, and elsewhere this surface is completely covered with closely set ranks of a third variety, the fliform papillce marshalled for the most part, especially behind, in lines neai'ly jjarallel on each side with the circum- vallate. The pharyngeal part of the dorsum is occupied by mucous glands, and small lymphoid masses, struct- urally similar to the tonsils, and arranged in lines parallel with the circumvallate papillfe. The Circumvallate walled-around ") Papillae (Fig. 707) vary in number from seven to twelve. The base of each is broad, its summit wider still. Its core is a prolongation of the corium of the mucous membrane, and many secondary Fig. 706.â€”Dorsal surface of the tongue. (Testut.)

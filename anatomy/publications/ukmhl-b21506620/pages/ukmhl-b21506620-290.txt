THE MUSCLES. 280 digit." Situation, the ulnar border of the hand. Origin, the pisiform. Direc- Hon, downward. Insertion, the ulnar border of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger and the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti. Action, abduction of little finger. Ne7-ve, the ulnar. Its function puts it in the group with the interossei dorsales, as it draws its digit from the mid-line of the hand. X Fig. 317.—Interossei palmares of right hand. The line a; a; is that to which adduction is made. (Testut.) Interossei Palmares (Fig. 317).—"The muscles between the bones in the palm." Synonym, interossei volares. Number, three. Situation, in the second, third, and fourth metacarpal interspaces, near the palmar surfaces of the bones. Origin, the first: ulnar side of second metacarpal; the second : radial side of fourth metacarpal; the third : the radial side of the fifth metacarpal. Direction, downward. Insertion, each into the side of the base of the first phalanx of the digit from whose metacarpal bone it arises, and also into the corresponding ex- tensor tendon. Action, each add nets its digit toward the middle finger ; also, it flexes the first phalanx of its digit, and extends the second and third phalanges. Nerve, the deep branch of the ulnar.

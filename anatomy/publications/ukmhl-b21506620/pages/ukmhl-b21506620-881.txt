SURFACE AX A TO 31Y. 869 Fig. 937.-This figure and the next one are de- gned to show the capacity of the body for rotation, he feet point in one direction, the face exactly op- osite. This was accomplished without previous ractice. Fig. 938.â€”To be comiiared with Fig. 937 The thighs and feet are held pointing away from the spectator, and the sitter has turned to face the camera a.s squarely as possible. If the effect obtained by this method be subtracted from that in Fig. 937, the amount of rotation below the movable vertebra; will be ascertained.

420 THE BLOOD-VASCULAB SYSTEM. anastomose with the profunda arteries and the anastomotica magna of the brachial; the main portion of the posterior interosseous passes downward to the wrist between the superficial and deep layers of muscles of the forearm. In the wrist the ulnar gives off anterior and posterior carpal branches ; these branches anastomose with similar branches of the radial and supply the carpus; the posterior carpal of the ulnar with the posterior carpal branch of the radial form on the back of the carpus the posterior cfDpal arch, which sends branches to the interosseous spaces and the fingers. In the hand the ulnar divides into the deep palmar and the superficial palmar, which latter forms with the superficialis volse of the radial, the superficial palmar arch (Fig. 464). The deep palmar branch passes between the flexor brevis and the abductor minimi digiti to reach the radial, which it assists in forming the deep Fig. 464.â€”Superficial palmar arch and its branches. (Testut.) palmar arch. The superficial palmar arch is situated between the palmar fascia and the flexor tendons at a point in the hand a little above the web of the thumb. The branches of the arch are the four (Jie/ital arteries, of which the inner one sup- plies the inner side of the little finger, the second the contiguous sides of the little and ring fingers, the third the contiguous sides of the ring and middle fingers, and

THE ARTERIES. ' 453 dorsal surface of the tarsal bones, supplying them and contiguous structures. The metatarsal winds outward over the bases of the metatarsal bones, forming an arch from which three interosseous branches are given off, which run forward in the three interosseous spaces to the webs of the toes, where they anastomose with the digital branches of the plantar arch. At the origin of these interosseous branches, perforating branches from the plantar arch communicate with each ves- sel. The dorsalis hallucis runs forward in the first interosseous space to the web Fig. 489.â€”Arteries of the dorsum of the foot. (Testut.) of the toes ; here it divides into two branches, supplying the contiguous sides of the great and second toe. The communicatinr/ or plantar digital branch perforates the first interosseous space to reach the plantar surface of the foot. Here it anastomoses with the external jilantar, and eom])letes the plantar arch. It then continues forward in the plantar surface of the fir.'^t interosseous space to the web of the toes. Here it divides into two branches which supply the eontigaous sur- faces of the great and second toes.

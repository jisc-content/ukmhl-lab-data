THE THORACIC NERVES. 619 THE THORACIC NERVES. The thoracic nerves differ from all the other spinal nerves in that they enter into the formation of no plexns; but each is distributed to a transverse segment of the trunk, corresponding to the vertebrae from between which it emerges. The first thoracic nerve sends a small branch to the interval between the first and second ribs, the main trunk, ascending in front of the first rib to join the brachial plexus. Its intercostal branch behaves like the others about to be described, but with rare exceptions has no lateral cutaneous branch. Tiie upper six thoracic nerves run round the chest wall in the spaces between the vertebro-sternal ribs ; the remaining six pursue a transverse course through the abdominal wall where the ribs are deficient in front. A typical intercostal nerve (Fig. 668), after receiving two rami communicantes from the corresponding ganglion of the sympathetic, passes outward between the internal branch (cutaneous; Fig. 668.—Plan of a typical intercostal nerve. (W. Keiller.) posterior intercostal aponeurosis and the pleura, beneath the intercostal artery. It enters the interval between the internal and external intercostal muscles, and runs in it till the external intercostal muscle becomes deficient in front. It then dips under the internal intercostal muscle, and, between it and the internal mam- mary artery and triangularis sterni, reaches the side of the sternum, where it pierces the chest wall to become cutaneous. The louier infercostali^, from the seventh to the eleventh inclusive, enter the interval between the transversalis and internal oblique muscles, where the ribs are deficient in front. They run forward in the abdominal wall, enter the sheath of the rectus abdominis, and pierce that muscle near the middle line to supply the skin. Lateral Cutaneous Branches (Figs. 669, 670).—The first intercostal nerve has no lateral cutaneous bi'anch.

THE MUSCUL0-8PIRAL NEBVE. 615 anterior, branches to the inner and outer heads of the ti'iceps and anconeus arise while the nerve is in the spiral groove, and important branches are contributed to the middle and inner heads of the triceps, while the parent nerve lies behind the brachial artery. One of these last, called by Kraase the ulnar collateral, accom- panies the ulnar nerve for some distance. The internal cutaneous branch (8. c.) arises within the axilla, and supplies a Fig. 664.â€”JIusculo-spiral and circumflex nerves of right side. (Testut.) strip of skin down the inner side of the arm, between the intercosto-humeral and circumflex areas. The external cutaneous branches are two in number, the upper (6. c.) being the smaller. It pierces the deeji fascia in the line of the intermuscular septum, and supplies the skin over the lower and outer part of the biceps. The lonier branch (6. 7. 8. c), becoming superficial a little below the last, descends behind the external condyle, and supplies the skin of the posterior radial region from elbow to Avrist.

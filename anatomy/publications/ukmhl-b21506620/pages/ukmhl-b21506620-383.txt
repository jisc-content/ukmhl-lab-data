373 THE HEART. midst of this space the marginal branch of the left coronary artery and the left marginal vein ; and, between the anricle and ventricle, the great coronary vein. The Inferior Surface is nearly flat, and looks downward and backward, con- forming to the sloping upper surface of the anterior portion of the diaphragm. Here are seen parts of both ventricles, separated by the posterior interventricular groove, which lodges the interventricular branch of the right coronary artery and the middle cardiac vein ; and at the back and right a small part of the right auricle and the aperture of entrance of the vena cava inferior. The Upper Surface is small and irregular, and is occupied by the great vessels which form the bulk of the stem of the heart—the pulmonary artery, the aorta, and the vena cava superior.

The latter is represented as The ventral, inferior, and left surfaces converge at the left anterior portion of the heart to a blunted point, called the apex. This is constituted entirely by the left ventricle, owing to the fact that the wall of this chamber is very much thicker than that of the right ventricle. The apex lies behind the space between the fifth and sixth costal cartilages, about three and a half inches from the middle line. THE PERICARDIUM. The pericardium ("around the heart") is the sac in which the heart is con- tained (Fig. 432). It consists of two parts : (1) an external, fibi'ous portion, and (2) an internal, serous portion. The fihrnns hag, composed mostly of white fibrous tissue, somewhat loosely encloses the heart, and is attached to various structures in the immediate neigh- borhood. Inferiorly it is firmly adherent to the diaphragm, with whose central

811 THE SCROTUM. The Cremasteric Fascia (midd/c fipennafic) consists of two layers of thin areolar tissue, between which are placed the voluntary muscular bundles—cre- raaster ("supporting") muscle—derived from the internal oblique. At the bottom of the scrotum this layer blends with the dartos. Tlie Infundibuliform Fascia {internal spermatic) is a delicate membrane derived from the fascia transversalis. It lines the cremasteric fascia. The Subperitoneal Tissue does not, properly speaking, form one of the layers of the scrotum. As a loose art'olar structure continuous with the subperitoneal tissue of the abdominal wall, it lines the infundil)uliform fascia, investing and forming laminae between the ditterent elements of the spermatic cord. Below, it connects loosely the inner surface of the infundil)uliform fascia to the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis. This with the preceding layer forms the so-called/(f.se/o propria. The tunica vaginalis has already been described. Vessels and Nerves.—The arterial supply of the sci'otum comes from the superficial and tleep external jtudic, and from the superficial perineal, a branch of the internal pudic. The cremasteric arteiy, a branch of the deep Fig. 878.—Spermatic veins. (Testut.) epigastric, is distributed chiefly to the cremaster muscle; lint it also sends branches to the deeper layers of the scrotum and anastomoses with the arte- ries of the testicle. The veins follow the corresponding arteries, and empty into the external saphenous and internal pudic. The lymphatics terminate in the supei'ficial inguinal nodes. The nerves are from the ilio-inguinal, the two super- ficial perineal, the inferior pudendal, and the genital branch of the genito-crural. The latter is distributed chiefly to the cremaster muscle.

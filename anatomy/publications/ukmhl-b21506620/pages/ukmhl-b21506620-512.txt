502 THE CEBEBBO-SPINAL AXIS. ventricle the main part is known as the body, and the prolongations from it are named respectively anterior horn, middle or descending horn, and posterior horn. The original sprout now serves for a passage of communication between the primary vesicle and the ventricle, and is known commonly as the foramen of Ilonro ; but it is better designated as porta ("the doorway"). The original cavity of the vesicle, now subordinate in extent to the large chambers to which it has given rise, is called aula ("the hall"). Thus we have from the cavity of the first vesicle the following parts : the aula in the centre, and on each side a porta, and a lateral ventricle with its three horns (Figs. 636, 537). Notice that the aula is distinctly below the plane of the body of the ventricle, and that the middle horn descends to a level much below that of the aula. Fig. 536.—Diagram of the full development of the lateral ventricles and their cornua—view from above. Passing to the cavity of the second encephalic vesicle—the diencephalon—we find that it considerably outgrows the aula, which is just in front of it. Its enlargement is very slight sidewise and is almost entirely up-and-down and backward, as if the vesicle had been squeezed between two vertical ]>lanes at the sides (Figs. 538, 539). The result of this development is to make the second vesicle a long, deep, narrow chink in the middle line—a fore-and-aft median crevice, with the aula in front and the third vesicle behind. The original con- striction between this cavity and that of the first vesicle becomes practically Fig. 537.—Same as Fig. 536—view from the left side. obliterated, and, consequently, the cavities of the aula and the second vesicle merge into one, the greater portion of which is contributed by the second vesicle, that furnished by the first vesicle being located at the upper and fore part. This composite cavity, made of the whole of the second and a part of the first vesicle,

THE NERVES. 618 Observe that the nail matrices and surrounding skin are supplied by the pal- mar nerves, that the little finger and inner side of the ring finger are supplied on both aspects by the ulnar nerve, and that the rest of the fingers are supplied by the median on the palmar, and by the radial on the dorsal surface.

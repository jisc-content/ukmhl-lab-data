PREFA GE. 6 and the pictorial and diagrammatic illustrations (thanks to the remarkable liber- ality of the publishers) are phenomenally abundant and of striking artistic excel- lence. The method of direct labelling of the pictures, which has been proved to be so helpful to the student, has been applied wherever practicable. It is thought that the plan of giving the directions for dissection in a sepa- rate chapter will be appreciated as a marked convenience to the student in the laboratory. The nomenclature employed is that in general nse among English-speaking anatomists. A few words, sanctioned by the approval of the Association of American Anatomists, or the Anatomische Gesellschaft, or both, have been nsed in preference to the customary, though less desirable, terms ; but, in every such case, the synonym is given, so that no confusion can arise. When a term, which has not been employed previously in the text, is intro- duced, its etymologic meaning is given parenthetically, unless its signification is manifest Avithout such assistance. By this means a new and helpful aspect of the topic is often presented to the mind. The articles on the bones, the joints, and the veins have been written by Dr. Woolsey, those on the periphei'al nervous system, the eye, the nose, and the skin by Dr. Keiller, that on embryology by Dr. McMurrich, that on the arteries by Dr. Bevan, that on the reproductive organs by Dr. Stewart, and the remainder by Dr. Gerrish.

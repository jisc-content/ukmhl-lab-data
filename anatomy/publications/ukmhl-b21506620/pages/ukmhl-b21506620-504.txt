THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 494 of the perineum frequently drain into this set; and occasionally vessels from the uterus end in it. The inferior set is situated at the saphenous opening. It takes the lymph from the superficial parts of the thigh, and of the entire leg and foot, except their outer side ; also from the scrotum and the integu- ments of the perineum, and sometimes the penis, vulva, urethra, and lower part of the vagina. The superficial inguinal nodes discharge partly into /' the deep inguinal and partly into the external iliac. The Popliteal Nodes, located deeply in the ham- ,y space, get their lymph from the surface of the outer X ^ side of the leg and foot, and the deep structures of the same segments of the limb. Their efiPerents join the deep lymphatic vessels of the leg. The Deep Inguinal Nodes are grouped around the upper end of the femoral artery and vein. Their afferent vessels come from the superficial inguinal nodes and from the deep structures of the greater Y .-f-' / part of the limb; and their efferents run to the ex- ternal iliac nodes.

The Gluteal Nodes, lying near the pyriformis muscle, derive their lymph from the deep parts of the buttocks, and transmit it to the internal iliac nodes.

198 THE BONES. and backward on the great wing of the sphenoid, the squamous portion of the temporal, and the parietal bone. The posterior fossa, the deepest and largest, lodges the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and pons, and is formed by the occipital bone, the petrous and mastoid portions of the temjioral, the postero-inferior angle of the parietal, and the body of the sphenoid. Its anterior limits are the posterior limits of the middle fossa, and its posterior limits the grooves for the lateral sinuses, whose limiting ridges Fig. 225.â€”Base of the cranium, inner surface. (Testut.) attach the tentorium cerehelli. The foramen magnum occupies the centre, and external to it from within outward are seen the anterior condylar foramen, the jugular foramen, and the internal auditory meatus. Behind the jugular foramen is the opening of the posterior condylar foramen when present, and more exter- nally, in the sigmoid sulcus, is the more constant mastoid foramen. The grooves for the lateral sinuses pass outward from tlie internal occipital protuberance, usually cross the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and thence bend sinuously down and in on the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and onto the occipital bone, where they curve forward and end at the posterior division of the jugular foramina. The grooves for the inferior petrosal sinuses lie along the suture between the petrous portion of the temporal bone and tlie occipital, and end in the anterior division of the jugular fonimina. The jugular foramen (foramen lacerum posterius) is usually unsymmetrical and of a somewhat pyriform shape. It is often divided into three compartments by two more or less marked con-

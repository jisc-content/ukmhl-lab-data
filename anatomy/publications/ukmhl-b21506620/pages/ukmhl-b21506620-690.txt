THE EYE. By W. KEILLER. THE eyeball, which is the essential organ of the sense of sight, is a somewhat spherical body, occupying the cavity of the orbit, where it lies embedded in a mass of fat and loose connective tissue. From the posterior two-thirds of the surface of the eye this bed is walled off by a membrane known as the capsule of Tenon (Fig. 730) between which and the globe of the eye there is a lymph-space Fig. 730.â€”The right eye in sagittal section, showing the capsule of Tenon.

The anterior third is covered by the conjunctiva, a mucous meml^rane reflected onto the globe from the deep aspect of both eyelids. The surface of the globe is pierced by numerous vessels and nerves, and gives attachment at certain points to the muscles, by which the movements of the eyeball are accomplished. A lateral view of the eye on the living subject reveals the fact that its sur- face is not all uniformly curved. In such a view the anterior, clear portion, known as the cornea, will be seen to bulge out appreciably beyond the normal curve of the posterior, white, or sclerotic portion. It thus appears that the eye- fiSO

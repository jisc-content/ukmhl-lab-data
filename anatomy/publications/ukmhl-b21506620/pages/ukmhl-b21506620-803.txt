791 THE URETHRA. Structure of the Urethra.â€”The hincr coat of the urethra is mucous membrane, continuous above with that of the bladder, below with the skin. It is unusually rich in elastic fibres. It lias, most mai'kedly in the spongy portion, fine longi- tudinal folds, which are efi^iiced during urination. The tube does not stand open, like the trachea or a severed artery, but opposite surfaces (generally the front and rear) of mucosa are in contact. Tlie ei)ithelium of the prostatic portion is similar to the vesical; in most other parts it is a simple columnar, but for a quarter inch back from the meatus it is of the flattened variety and stratified. The corium is plentifully studded with small papillaj. Mucous follicles and race- mose glands are practically everywhere proximal to tlie navicular fossa. There are also many openings which were formerly thought to belong to glandular structures, but have been ascertained to be blind depressions obliquely set in the mucosa, their mouths always directed toward the external meatus (Fig. 863). They are kicunce, " little lakes," and are found in the free spongy portion, proxi- mal to the fossa navicularis, in two sets, large and small. The large are one- third incli deep and occur in a single, median row in the anterior (upper) wall; the small are located princii)ally in the anterior surface and at the sides in

118 THE BONES. heart-shaped, only slightly wider transversely than from before backward, and deeper behind than in front. Where the body joins the arch two demi-facets are found on either side, one at the upper and one at the lower bordei'. Each facet with the contiguous one on the adjacent vertebra completes a cavity for the head of a rib. The lower vertebral notches are deeper than the upper. Each broad, flat pair of the lamince is imbricated, or sloped, over the pair below, like the tiles Fig. 137.—a thoracic vertebra, upper surface. (Testut.) of a roof. The spinous process is long and three-sided, and projects considerably downward, especially in the middle of the series. The transverse processes project outward and slightly backward. The oval facets on the front of their tips are for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. The rib in situ forms with this process a costo-transverse foramen. Of the two pairs of artictdar processes, the articular Fig. 138.—Thoracic vertebra, seen from the left side. Fig. 139.—Thoracic vertebra, viewed from (Testut.) behind. (Testut.) surfaces of the upper pair look backward and slightly outward and upward, those of the lower pair forward and slightly inward and downward. foramen is round, and not as large as in the cervical or hmibar region. Peculiar Thoracic Vertebrae.—These are the first, nintli, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first is a transitional vertebra, resembling the lower cervical vertebrte, especially on its upper surface. The body is elongated transversely, and lijiped laterally above. There are entire facets above for the first pair of ribs, and demi- facets below for the second pair. The superior articular processes have largely an upward direction. The spinous process is long, nearly horizontal, and even more prominent than that of the vertebra prominens. The ninth has demi-facets above, but frequently none below. If the lower ones are present, it is a typical vertebra.

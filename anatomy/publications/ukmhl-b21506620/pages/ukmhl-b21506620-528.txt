518 THE CEBEBBO-SPINAL AXIS. line of the cerebrum all of these fibres are compressed vertically and, to a less degree, antero-posteriorly into a solid mass. Consequently the fibres seem to radiate from each side of this condensed body—going out, up, down, forward, backward—to terminate in the gray matter at the periphery of the hemisphere (Figs. 566, 567). The mass (with a slight addition, presently to be described) is the corpus callosum (" the hard body "), called, also, merely callosum. The middle of it can be seen by drawing the upper portions of the hemispheres apart, so as to widen the great longitudinal fissure, and looking directly downward into this enlarged cleft Fig. 566.—Diagram of coronal sec- tion of cerebrum to sliow course of fibres of callosum. (Testut.) Fig. .567.—Iiia;4raiii of horizontal section of cerebrum to show course of fibres of callosum. (Testut.) (Fig. 561). It presents a free surface on top, in front, and behind ; but its shape and size are not appreciated until sections of the cerebrum are made in various directions. A vertical median division of the cerebrum shows a cut surface of the callosum, which reveals its form and extent from before backward (Fig. 568). It is seen to be a long, thick, irregularly flattened arch. Its front end is curled back underneath, and is called the ffenu (" knee "). This thins out rapidly to an edge, the rostrmn (" beak "), which is connected with the front part of the wall of the third ventricle by a delicate plate, the basal white commissure, or copula. The hind end, also, is rounded, its lower part being folded sharply forward, and is named the splenium (" bandage "). The portion between the genu and splenium is the body. If the cerebral tissues which overlie the callosum at the sides are cut away, it is found to be depressed along the middle line, and to

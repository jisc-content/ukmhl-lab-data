(W. Keiller, after Testut.) sensory nuclei (in blue). The motor mtclei are arranged in two interrupted columns, the third, fourth, sixth, and twelfth motor nuclei forming one column close to the middle line, and'very near the floor of the aqueduct, fourth ventricle or central canal; while the motor nuclei of the fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh form another column, more deeply and more laterally situated than the first and deviating somewhat toward the side above, where the ventricle is widest. The fifth nerve has a well-marked ascending root, which is probably motor, as well as a crossed motor root. The spinal portion of the spinal accessory arises from the cells of the ventral horn of gray matter as low as the sixth or seventh cervical nerve. Coming now to the sensory nuelei, each sensory nerve has an ascending root. Thus the fifth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and accessory portion of the eleventh have each an ascending root which a]>pears to bring it into relation with the nucleus of the funiculus cuneatus and gelatinous substance of Rolando (compare the con- nection of the sensory roots of the spinal nerves with the same nuclei). Each nerve has in addition a special sensory nucleus—the eighth nucleus is divisible into three groups—near the level of its point of exit and dorso-lateral to the motor nuclei. In longitudinal extent the nucleus of the third nerve occupies the floor of the aqueduct from the posterior commissure to the groove between the superior and inferior quadrigeminal bodies, the nucleus of the fourth lies ventrally to the testis, the fifth nucleus nearly corresponds to the lateral recess, the sixth lies under the eminentia teres, the eighth nuclei are on a level with the stria; acustic£e, and the

629 COLLATERAL BRANCHES OF SACRAL PLEXUS. The nerve to the ohtarntor intenius, from the fifth himbar and npper two 8acral nerves, appears on the hip beneath the pyriformis, crosses the spine of the ischium outside the internal pudic vessels, and passes through the small sacrosciatic fora- men to the obturator internus, supplying the superior gemellus as it passes. The superior gluteal nerve (Figs. 677, 679), springing from the back of the lurabo-sacral cord and first sacral nerve, leaves the pelvis through the great sacro- FiG.

(Testut.) sciatic foramen with the gluteal vessels, and under the gluteus medius divides into a small superior branch to that muscle, and a larger inferior branch, which accompanies the inferior branch of the gluteal artery and is distributed to the gluteus medius and minimus, and tensor vaginas femoris. The inferior gluteal nerve (Fig. 679) arises from the lumbo-sacral cord and first and second sacral nerves, and is frequently closely associated with the small sciatic nerve. It emerges from the great sacrosciatic foramen beneath the pyri- formis, and enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus, which it supplies. The small sciatic nerve (ischiatic nerve) (Figs. 677, 678, 679, 687, 688) is a purely cutaneous nerve, supplying the skin of the buttock, perineum, and back of the thigh and popliteal region. It springs from the back of the upper three sacral nerves, and appears on the buttock beneath the pyriformis, and on the sur- face of the great sciatic nerve. At the lower border of the gluteus maximus it, lies under the deep fascia on the middle line of the back of the thigh. Distrib- uting cutaneous filaments as it descends, its terminal fibres pierce the deep fascia

THE SPHENOID BONE. 177 of this groove is bounded on either side by a bony projection, internally by the petrosal process, which springs from the side of the base of the dorsum sellse and fits against the apex of the petrous ])ortion of the temporal bone, and externally by the lingula (" little tongue "), a thin lamella projecting backward between the body and the great wing. The posterior surface is united to the basilar process of the occipital by cartilage in early life, and by bony union in the adult. On PTERYGOID NOTCH. HAMULAR PROCESS.

(Testut.) the anterior surface the vertical spjhenoidal crest projects in the middle line, below the ethmoidal spine, and articulates with the vertical plate of the ethmoid. On either side, superiorly, are the rounded orifices of the two sphenoidal sinuses, which occupy much of the body of the bone. They are unequally divided by a vertical lamina, the sphenoidal septum, continued back from the crest. These openings and the surfaces beneath them are on the roof of the nasal fossae, and the rough surfaces on either side articulate with the lateral masses of the ethmoid above and with the orbital processes of the ])alate bones below. Much of this surface on either side, between the articular areas and the crest and below the orifices, is formed by the spJienoicJal turbinate (" top-shaped") bones. These are triangular HAMULAR PROC. Fig. 198.—The sphenoid bone, viewed from behind. (Testut.) or conical in shape, with the apex directed downward and backward. They are formed separately, often come away with the ethmoid or palate bones in disarticu- lating, and sometimes appear in the orbit. The inferior surface presents in front a median ridge, the rostrum ("beak"), continuous with the crest and received between the alje and the vomer. The surface on either side forms part of the roof of the pharynx, and is partly covei'ed by the vaginal processes of the inter- 12

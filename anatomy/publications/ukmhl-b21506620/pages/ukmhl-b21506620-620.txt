THE NERVES. 610 Muscular Branches.—The branch to the pronator teres (6. c.) is given off just above the bend of the elbow, those for the palmaris longus (7. 8. c., 1. th.), flexor carpi radialis (6. c), and flexor sublimis digitorum (7. 8. c, 1. th.) a little lower down. The anterior interosseous nerve (7. 8. c, 1. th.) (Figs. 660, 663) is the muscular Fig. 660.—Deep nerves of the front of the right forearm. (Testut.) branch of the median to the deep muscles of the forearm. Commencing opposite the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, it accompanies the anterior interossous artery and lies on the interosseous membrane between the flexor ])ro- fundus digitorum and flexor longus pollicis. It supplies branches to both these mu.scles, that to the flexor ])rofundus communicating with the corresponding branch of the ulnar nerve. The nerve accompanies the arteiy under the pronator quadratus; but, instead of following the vessel through the interosseous mem-

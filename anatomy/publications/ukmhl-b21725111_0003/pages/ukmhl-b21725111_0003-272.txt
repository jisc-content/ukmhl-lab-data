UPPER LIMB, completely fills the fossa, and its fibres converge bo- neatli the acromion to a tendon, which adheres to the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and is inserted into the upper of the three facets on the great tuberosity of the humerus. Fig. 176.â€”Superficial Mus- cles OP THE Shoulder and Upper Limb, prom before. 1, pectoralis major; 1', its clavicular portion ; 2, deltoid ; 3, biceps brachii ; 3', its tendon of insertion; 3", its aponeu- rotic slip; 4, bracliialis anticus ; 4', its inner and lower portion ; 5, inner head of the triceps ; 6', lower part of the same, seen rising from behind the inter- muscular septum. The expla- nation of the remaining references will be found iu the description of fig. 179. The infraspmatus muscle, occupying the greater part of the infraspinal fossa, arises from the under surface of the spine and from the whole surface of the blade of the scapula below the spine, except those parts at the lower angle and along the external border, to which the teres muscles are at- tached. The fibres converge to a tendon, which is con- cealed at first within the sub- stance of the muscle, and is inserted into the middle facet of the great tuberosity of the humerus. The supraspinatus muscle is covered by the trapezius and the acromion process. The infraspinatus muscle is bound down by an aponeurosis, which superiorly and externally divides so as to enclose the deltoid muscle. It is covered by the deltoid at its upper and outer part, and by the trapezius at its upper and imier part, by

97 FORM OF THE PELVIS. THE PELVIS. The ossa innominata with the sacrum and coccyx form the osseous walls of the pelvis. This part of the skeleton may be considered as divided into two parts at the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, the sacral promontory and the ilio-pectineal lines. The circle thus completed constitutes the brim or inlet of the lower or true pelvis ; the space above it, between the iliac fossfe, belongs really to the abdomen, but has been called the upper or false pelvis. The inferior circumference, or o^itlet of the pelvis, presents three bony eminences, the coccyx and the tuberosities of the ischium. Between the tuberosities of the ischium in front is the pubic or sub-pubic arch, which bounds an angular space extending forwards to the symphysis, and is formed by the descending rami of the ossa pubis and the asceuding rami of the ischia. The interval between the sacrum and coccyx and the ischium on each side is bridged over in the recent state by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, which therefore assist in bounding the outlet of the pelvis.

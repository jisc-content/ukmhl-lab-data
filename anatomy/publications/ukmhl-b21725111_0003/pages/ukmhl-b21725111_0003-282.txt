The flexor longus poUicis, placed side by side with the flexor profundus, anses from the grooved surface, on the fore part of the radius from the oblique line to the edge of the pronator quadratus ; it arises also from the adjacent part of the interosseous ligament, and by a rounded fleshy and tendinous slip distinct from the rest of the muscle, from the inner part of the coronoid process. The muscle ends in a tendon which passes behind the annular ligament of the wrist close to the trapezium, turns outwards between the two heads of the flexor brevis and between the sesamoid bones, and entering a canal similar to those of the other flexor tendons, is finally inserted into the base of the second phalanx of the thumb. Inferiorly, a part of this muscle is placed superficially between the flexor carpi radialis and the supinator longus, where it supports the radial vessels. The pronator quadratus, placed close to the bones behind the last two muscles, arises from the anterior and inner surfaces of the ulna for about two inches above its carpal extremity ; its fibres cross the lower part of the forearm, some transversely and others obliquely, and they are inserted for an equal distance into the fore part of the radius. h. Posterior and Outer Regions (Extensors and Supinators). The muscles of this group are, like those of the front of the forearm, divided into a superficial and a deep layer. The superficial muscles are six iu number, viz., the supinator longus, the extensores carpi radiales longior and brevior, the extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The supinator radii longus arises from the upper two-thirds of the external condyloid ridge of the humerus, and is interposed between the brachialis anticus and the external intermuscular septum, to which its fibres are attached. The thin fleshy mass proceeding from this elongated origin descends upon the anterior and outer border of the forearm, and ends about the middle in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the external border of the radius, near the base of the styloid process. This muscle is covered only by skin and fascia, except at its insertion, where two of the extensor tendons of the thumb lie superficial to it. The extensor carpi radialis longior, partly covered by the supinator longus, arises from the lower part of the external condyloid ridge of the humerus, and from the intermuscular septum. Its muscular beUy ends at the meeting of the upper and middle thirds of the forearm in a flat tendon, which passes conjointly with that of the following muscle over the lower end of the radius in the outermost of the two broad grooves on the posterior surface of that bone, and is inserted into the base of the second metacarpal bone. A small bursa lies beneath the tendon at its insertion.

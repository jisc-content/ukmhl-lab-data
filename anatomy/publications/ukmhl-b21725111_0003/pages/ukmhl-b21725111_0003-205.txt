143 CARPAL ARTICULATIONS. The bones of the second roio are connected by simUar means. The dorsal and palmar ligaments, each three in number, pass transversely between the contiguous bones. The inter-osseous ligaments are generally three (but Fig. 132.

A small inter-osseous ligament is also sometimes found between the os magnum and the scaphoid. (Fig. 133.)

249 EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE, The a2)oneurosis of the external oblique, wider at the lower than at the upper part, and larger than that of either of the subjacent abdominal muscles, extends inwards towards the middle line in front ; at some distance from this, but farther out above than below, it becomes insepai'ably united with the aponeurosis beneath, and forms a part of the sheath of the rectus muscle in the whole extent of the space from the ensiform cartilage to the syni^jhysis pubis. The upper part of the ai^oneurosis is connected externally with the larger pectoral muscle. Its lower fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend across from the anterior superior iliac spine to the spine of the pubes, in the form of a broad band, which is called the liya- mmt of Fallop'ius, or more commonly of Fonjmrt. This band is curved at the middle and outer pai ts, the convexity of the curve being directed towards Fig. 197.

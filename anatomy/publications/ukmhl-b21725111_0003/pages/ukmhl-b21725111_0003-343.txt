EXTENSOR MUSCLES OF THE TOES. 281 eacli side, and from the fascia of the leg. The fleshy fibres from this exten- sive origin pass obliquely into a tendon placed on the anterior part of the muscle. This subsequently divides into four slips, which descend through the lower part of the annular ligament, in the same sheath as the peroneus tertius, and on the dorsum of the foot pass respectively to the four outer toes. Not unfrcqucntly the slip belonging to the fifth toe is separated with that of the peroneus tertius from the rest considerably higher up. The three inner tendons are eacli joined at the outer side, on the first phalanx, by a tendon from the extensor brevis digitorum : all the four tendons are continued into expansions, which are joined on the first phalanx by tendinous processes from the lumbricales and interossei muscles, and have their middle fibres inserted into the second phalanx ; while their lateral parts unite together and are inserted on the third, in a manner exactly similar to the arrangement of the extensor tendons on the fingers.

The peroneus tei-tius arises, in continuity with the lower part of the extensor longus digitorum, from the lower fourth of the inner surface of the fibula, from the lower part of tlie interosseous membrane, and from an - - aponeurosis which connects it on the outer side with the peroneus brevis. The muscular fibres end in a tendon, wliich after passing through the annular ligament with the long extensor of the toes, IS inserted into the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and likewise in some instances into the fourth. There is often Rcarcely any line of demarcation between the two precedinfr muscle-, The peroneus tcrt.ns is sometimes as large as the extensor longus digitorum somo times Its tendon is as largo as those of that muscle combined : it lias been ob",oi3 to terminate on the fourtli metatarsal bone; and it is sometimes altogether wantino^^

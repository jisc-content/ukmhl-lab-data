Between the external surface of the muscle and the ramus of the maxilla are the internal lateral ligament and the internal maxillary vessels, with the dental artery .ma nerve; and at its upper part the muscle is crossed by the external pterygoid muscle, us inner surface, whilst in the pterygoid groove, is in contact with the tensor paiati muscle; and lower down it corresponds with the superior constrictor of Fig. 158.

The external pterygoid muscle, occupying the zygomatic fossa, arises by two fleshy heads placed close together, the superior of which is tittaclied to

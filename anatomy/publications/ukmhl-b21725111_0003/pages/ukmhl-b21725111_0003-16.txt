ii INTRODUCTION. Most of tlie textures occur in more than one organ, and some of them indeed, as the connective and vascular, in nearly all, so that a multitude of organs, and these greatly diversified, are constructed out of a small number of constitxieut tissues, just as many different words are formed by the varied combinations of a few letters ; and parts of the body, differing ■widely in form, construction, and uses, may agree in the nature of their component materials. Again, as the same texture possesses the same essential characters in whatever organ or region it is found, it is obvious that the structure and properties of each tissue may be made the subject of investigation apart from the organs into whose formation it enters. General and Descriptive Anatomy.—These considerations naturally point out to the Anatomist a twofold line of study, and have led to the subdivi- sion of Anatomy into two branches, the one of which treats of the nature and general properties of the component textures of the body : the other treats of its several organs, members, and regions, describing the outward form and internal structure of the parts, their relative situation and mutual connection, and the successive conditions which they present in the pro- gress of their formation or development. The former is usually named "General" Anatomy, or "Histology;"* the latter "Descriptive" Anatomy. • From iVrbs, a web.

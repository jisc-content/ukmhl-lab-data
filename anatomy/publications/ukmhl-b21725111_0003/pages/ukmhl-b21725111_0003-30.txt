xvi PRODUCTION OF CELLS. coUa, progressively increasing in number, which combine to form the first material substratum of the tissues and organs of the embryo, and are hence termed " embryonic cells." The outline of the process is this. The germinal vesicle disappears ; the yelk shrinks somewhat together, then separates into two halves (b) ; the first two segments divide each again into two (c), and the binary Pig. IX.

These final segments are the embryonic cells (d) ; they probably have no distinct, separable envelope ; but, like other naked cells, they are formed of a nucleus and body of protoplasmic matter. The nucleus is a globule of soft pellucid substance •, it may not be always discoverable in the earlier segments, being hidden by the opaque granular mass ; but it soon comes into view, and it seems to play an important part in the formation of the cells. The nucleus in fact appears to initiate the process of division, by itself dividing into two halves, which, speedily acquiring full size, serve as two centres of attraction, round each of which separately the yelk-substance is gathered, and thus parted into two new segments. Possibly the substance of the vanishing germinal vesicle and spot may give rise to the first nucleus. Fig. X. A. B C D Pig^ X. Division of the Yelk op Ascaris.

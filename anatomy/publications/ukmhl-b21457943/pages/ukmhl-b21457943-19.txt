19 branches) of Science as possible; since we see how all are more or less essential to each, and each to all; and that the more of them the human mind can fairly grasp, the better must it understand each. We should examine the human body, almost in the same manner, the engineer examines a machine he wishes to become perfectly ac- quainted with. He must know its concurring parts (organs or in- struments ;) their form; relation; mode of connexion; the materials of these and their properties; the action of each part; the chants to Which it may be liable ; the influences it may be subject to fronTwith- out or within. He, therefore, besides taking it to pieces, observes it with or without experiment, in or out of action natural and unnatu- ral. He does more than can be accomplished for the living machine ■ he puts it together again: that is, he proceeds synthetically as well as analytically. We cannot do this, but, still, we can, in some respects proceed synthetically from certain data taken dpriori, as I shal pre- sently shew. 1 In proceeding analytically, we cannot do better than adopt the rules for examining organs laid down by Beclard in his Anatomie Generate The Anatomist has to consider in each :-lstly.

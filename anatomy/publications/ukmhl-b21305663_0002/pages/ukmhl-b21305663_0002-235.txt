I have found it impossible, in some instances, to discover these glands; and, in other instances, they are remarkably small. We are as yet ignorant of the nature or use of the fluid secreted by these glands. SECTION X. OF THE LATERAL VIEW OF THE CONTENTS OF THE PELVIS OF THE MALE. Having described the structure of the contents of the pel- vis of the male, it may not be improper to direct the atten- tion of the reader, in a more particular manner, to the relative situation and connection of those organs, which are seen most distinctly in the side view of the pelvis. The lateral view of the pelvis, which is had by removing the greater part of one of the ossa innominata, affords by far the most instructive view of the relative situation and connec- tion of the contents of the pelvis. Drs Camper and Rosen mul leu removed one of the ossa innominata entire, by dividing the symphysis pubis before, and the sacro-iliac symphysis behind, but it is better to leave about one and a half inch, or two inches, of the os innominar- tum adhering to the other os innominatum, by which the at-

4,71 ON THE HUMAN SKIN. general observations on the human skin. The skin, the common integument, forms a dense covering for the protection of the subjacent parts. The thickness of the skin varies in different parts of the body. It is thinnest where flexion is required, and on the most delicate and sensible parts of the body. The skin on the chest, on the back, and outer side of our limbs, is thicker than that of the lips, eye-lids, glans penis, clitoris, labia pu- dendi, or extremities of the finger. The skin of the female is finer than that of the male. The skin not only covers the surface of the body, but is reflected inwards into the canals which open on the surface of the body, and is continuous with the mucous membranes which line them. The surface of the skin is kept moist by exhalation. On those parts of the skin which are exposed to the air, or to friction, as that of the nose and axillae, there are a number of pores, or open mouths of ducts, from which a viscid mat- ter may be squeezed out, which, in some cases, is very tena- cious ; and ,from being forced out in long-shaped masses, has been mistaken for worms. By a warm atmosphere the skin is relaxed, and a greater quantity of matter is exhaled, especially when the body is naked; and, on the other hand, by cold the skin is contracted and corrugated. Considerable heat applied to the skin occasions a sensible redness, which is followed by blistering. When the dead skin is exposed to heat and moisture, it becomes brownish; then of a yellow green colour; and, lastly, it assumes a dark-brown hue, emitting, at the same time, a very offensive gas, and it is covered by a mucus which com- municates to wood a stain of a deep brown colour; and hence it removes paint from wood. This mucus is produced by the decomposition of the body, and consists of a fatty substance, combined probably with ammonia. By boiling, the skin becomes very white, it swells, is. sof- tened, and converted into a pulp; and, by long boiling, is

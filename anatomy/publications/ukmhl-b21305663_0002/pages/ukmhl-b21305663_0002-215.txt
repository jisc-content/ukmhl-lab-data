OF THE TESTES. 177 SECTION VII. OF THE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION, AND THEIR APPENDAGES. The testes of the adult are contained in a purse or bag, called Scrotum, which externally is formed of the common integuments, internally of a bed of a reticulated cellular sub- stance of considerable extent, and which is continuous with the skin of the penis and thigh ; so that, in cases of anasarca, the scrotum attains a large size, owing to the accumulation of water within it, in which there are in some robust men muscular fibres, which have been described as a muscle under the name Dartos. The skin of the scrotum is of a brownish purple hue : has in young persons a rugose surface in cold weather, but du- ring warm weather it is soft and relaxed, so that the testes appear to hang loose and low. There is a prominent ridge upon the scrotum, called Ra- phe, which is opposite to the partition which divides the scro- tum into two distinct sacs. The scrotum is covered by a few hairs, and is largely sup- plied by sebaceous glands. There is very little or no fat within the scrotum, excepting near to the under abdominal aperture. The skin of the scrotum is largely supplied with nerves, which are derived from the external pudic nerves, and it is very sensible. The bloodvessels of the scrotum are derived from the pu- dendal and femoral vessels. SECTION VIII. OF THE TESTES. Before describing the testes, it seems necessary to premise a description of the spermatic chord, by the medium of which

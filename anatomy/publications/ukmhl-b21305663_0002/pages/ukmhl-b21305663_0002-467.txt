OF THE MUSCLES OF THE EYE-BALL. 421 Bv the abductor, the eye-ball is pulled towards the temple; by the adductor, towards the nose. Obliquus, Superior and Inferior. The former arises /rom the side of the foramen opticum ; its tendon included within a bursa, passes through a cartila- ginous pully, fixed behind the internal angular process ol the os frontis; it afterwards is reflected under the levator oculi, and is fixed into the sclerotic coat, between the insertion of the levator oculi, and entrance of the optic nerve. The latter arises from the anterior edge of the orbitar process of the su- perior maxillary bone, and is inserted into the sclerotic coat, between the entrance of the optic nerve, and the insertion of the abductor oculi. By the superior oblique, the pupil is turned downwards and outwards; and by the inferior, upwards and inwards. The oblique muscles of the eye form a girth around the eye-ball, between the lens and the bottom of the eye: hence, by their pressure, they increase the distance of the lens from the retina, or increase the posterior part of the axis of the eye-ball. There are various instances of the irregular action of the muscles of the eye-ball: these very often occur in epilepsy, hysteria, and other diseases called nervous. Many persons do not direct the axes of both eyes to- wards the same object, which is the cause of squinting, and is owing to the irregular action of the muscles of the eye-ball. It would appear, that some time elapses before the muscles of the eye-ball acquire the power of acting in a correct manner, for the eyes of children at birth are moved in an irregular manner, and sometimes they squint, which gene- rally goes off in a short time ; for, by habit, we acquire an equal command over the muscles of both eyes, and direct the eyes as we please. Squinting is also sometimes instantaneous, as when persons from any cause are thrown into a state of ecstasy.

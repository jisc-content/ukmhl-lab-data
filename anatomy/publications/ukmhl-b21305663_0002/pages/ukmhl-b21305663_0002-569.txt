OF THE FAR VAGUM. â– 323 Of the Par Vagum of the Eighth Pair of Nerves. Upon the recurrent nerve being detached from the eighth pair of nerves, there is a.plexus of nerves formed by the small branches passing from the recurrent nerves of opposite sides, and by the branches of the sympathetic nerves, which go to the heart. This plexus covers the larger branches of the pul- monary artery; and there are some small branches of nerves which creep along the smaller ramifications of the pulmonary artery. This plexus has been called the anterior plexus of nerves, in contradistinction to the posterior pulmonary plexus, formed by die eighth pair, and which are situated behind the root of the lungs. The smaller branches of this plexus accompany the branches of the air-tubes, and of the pulmonary bloodvessels within the substance of the lungs; and from this plexus some small nerves are sent to the heart. The pulmonary plexuses being detached, the eighth pair divides into cords, which surround the oesophagus, and which form what anatomists have described as the cesophagean plexuses. These plexuses of nerves have been extremely well repre- sented by Professor Scarpa, though it appears to me that the branches are larger than I have seen them in nature. Of tlLe Cardiac Nerves. The cardiac nerves are derived from the eighth pair, and also from the sympathetic nerve, chiefly from the latter. Some filaments are derived from the sympathetic nerve in its progress along the neck, but the greater number are derived from that nerve in its progress through the thorax. Of the Cardiac Nerves of the Right Side. On the right side there are three principal cardiac nerves. The superior cardiac nerve is derived from the uppermost cervical ganglion, and also from some filaments of the laryn- geal nerve. This nerve creeps along the common carotid arterv as far

405 OF THE OPTIC NERVE AND RETINA. lines from the retina; the insensible spot on the bottom of the eve will be one line in diameter; and, with this calculation, I found that the actual measurement of the medullary part of the optic nerve agrees very nearly. « I next found, that an object begins to disappear when the point to which the eye is directed is one-fourth of the distance of the eye from it; and hence, upon the supposition above stated, the axis of the eye-ball will be found to be two lines and a quarter from the outer side of the optic nerve, and two lines and three quarters from its centre.” There are a number of small arteries distributed upon the surface of the retina, which are derived from the central ar- tery of the optic nerve : these probably enable the nerve to communicate its impressions with greater force. The retina is the seat of vision, and the whole of the retina (says Dr Young) is of such a form as to receive the most perfect image on every point of its surface that the state of each refracted ray will admit; and the varying density of the crystalline lens renders that state more capable of delineating such a picture than any other imaginable contrivance could have done. Marriote and Priestly thought the choroid coat the seat of vision,—an opinion contrary to analogy, and disproved by the effect of pressure on the thalami inducing blindness, and by diseases which injure the optic nerve. The insensibility is not owing to the central artery, for the size of the insensible spot is greater than the space occupied by that artery. It has been supposed by Comparetti, that every part of the retina is not equally sensible to the impressions of light: he states, that distinct vision only takes place in the optic axis. * Upon this assertion Dr Young has justly remarked, speak- ing of his own eye, that the visual axis being fixed in any di- rection, he can see at the same time a luminous object placed at considerable distances from it The angle, however, differs : upwards it extends to 50°, inwards to 50°, downwards to 70% and outwards to 905.

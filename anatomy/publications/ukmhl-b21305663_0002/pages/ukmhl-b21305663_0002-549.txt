OF THE SPINAL COED. 503 From the ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, small nerves are derived, which creep along the trunks of the subclavian artery and aorta, to the heart. When the sympathetic nerve has reached the chest, it becomes larger. Of the Accessory Nerves. The accessory nerves arise from the sides of the medulla obongata, and spinal marrow, and pass out at the foramina lacera in basi cranii, along with the par vagum of the eighth pair. These nerves are connected by filaments to the pos- terior bundles of some of the spinal nerves. The accessory nerves are then detached from the eighth pair, perforate the sterno-mastoid muscles, and terminate on the trapezius muscle. There is a branch of this nerve which is sent off before it perforates the sterno-mastoid muscle, which assists in forming the pharyngeal nerve. Of the Spinal Cord. The spinal marrow, or spinal cox-d, is lodged within, and defended by, the bony canal, formed by the conjunction of the vertebrae of the back. It extends from the medulla ob- longata of the bi*ain to the second vertebra of the loins, as a solid coi'd, where it terminates in a conical point. The spinal cord is not of an uniform size; it is sensibly smaller where it passes through the vertebrae of the back, than where it passes through the cervical or lumbar verte- brae ; and, as it follows the same course as the spine, is not straight. The younger the embryo the greater the proportion the spinal cord bears to the brain ; and, according to Seebes, the spinal cord and corpora quadrigemina of the brain bear a direct ratio to each other. The spinal cord, like the biâ€™ain, is covered by the dura mater, the arachnoid coat, and pia mater. From its sides nerves in pairs are derived, which pass through foramina com- mon to two vertebrae, and through the foramina of the os sa- crum.

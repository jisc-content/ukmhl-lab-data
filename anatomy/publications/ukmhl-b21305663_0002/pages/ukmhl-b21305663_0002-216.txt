178 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the testes arc connected with the body, and along which the artery from which the semen is chiefly derived, and the accom- panying veins and nerves, pass. Of the Spermatic Chord. The Spermatic Chord may, for the sake of more accurate description, be divided into an external and internal part. The external part, which descends obliquely from the un- der abdominal aperture, to the body of the testis, consists of the spermatic artery and spermatic veins, of absorbents, nerves, and of the vas deferens, which are united by a cellu- lar substance; it is covered by a superficial fascia, by the cre- master muscle, and by a process of the peritona-um, which may be called the tunica vaginalis of the spermatic chord, and which, in hernia of considerable duration, has sometimes at- tained a considerable thickness. That part of the chord which is internal is much smaller than the external portion. It is composed of the spermatic and epigastric artery, the former of which takes its rise from the fore-part of the aorta, generally below the renal; it crosses over the ureter and psoas muscle, becoming gradually larger, and passes into the pelvis behind the peritonaeum, and under the edge of the internal oblique and transverse mus- cles; when it reaches the under abdominal aperture, it co- vers the origin of the epigastric artery : it then passes along the spermatic chord, to which it gives several small branches; and on reaching the body of the testicle it divides into several small branches, which are distributed through the body of that gland. This, in proportion to its diameter, is the longest artery of the human b ;dy, and in quadrupeds describes a tortuous course, and is much longer than in man ; it seems, therefore, probable, that this very peculiar mode of distribution of this artery is essential to the secretion of the semen. A branch from the epigastric artery very frequently ac- companies the vas deferens in its course along the spermatic chord.

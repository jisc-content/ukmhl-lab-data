OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY". 299 fabulimi, by the conjoined branches of the external circumflex artery, and a small gluteal artery-; I have made the more particular mention of these arterial circles, or as they may be called Double Anastomoses, found in the above described case, as Scaupa has not represented such arterial circles in his very splendid arid accurate,plates of the arteries of the head, neck, superior and inferior extre- mities. In most cases, the perforating branches come off separate- ly ; but, in other instances, I have seen them derived from a common trunk. The second perforating branch is the continuation of the trunk of the artery : it passes through the adductor maximus muscle, near to the linea aspera, and also to the shorter head of the biceps muscle, and divides into a number of small branches, which are distributed upon the biceps flexor cruris. This artery also gives branches to the vastus ih tern us, and to the long adductor of the thigh; and it sends upwards a branch which anastomoses with the first perforant. The third perforating artery passes over the short head of the biceps flexor cruris, and afterwards dips into the substance of the vastus externus, and anastomoses with the branches of the external circumflex muscle. The branches of the fourth perforating artery are distri- buted upon both heads of the biceps; and some of its branches are distributed upon the semitendinosus, and semimembrano- sus muscles. About two-thirds down the thigh, the trunk of the super- ficial femoral passes obliquely backwards between the tendon of the adductor magnus and the thigh-bone: it reaches the back part of the thigh-bone, then descends into the ham, where it lies on the flat part of the thigh-bone, and is covered by the corresponding vein and the sciatic nerve, and is well pro- tected by the condyles of the thigh-bones and a quantity of fat and cellular substance.

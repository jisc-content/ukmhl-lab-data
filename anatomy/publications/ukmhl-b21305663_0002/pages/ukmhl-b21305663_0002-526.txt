There is generally a relation between the colour of the skin, and that of the eyes and hair. If the complexion be dark, the eyes are so,â€”but if fair, the eyes are light. The corpus mucosum, like the paint on the choroid coat, and iris of the eye, and colouring matter of the hair, is probably awanting in albinoes: hence, the remarkable degree of white- ness of their skin. When oxymuriatic acid is applied to the skin of a Negro, it assumes a dirty yellow colour, and, according to Fodrcuoy, the black colour returns in a few days. I have seen a Negro with a great many large white spots on his body, which I was informed were not occasioned by blisters, or any other artificial means. Authors make mention of women becoming of a dark co- lour during pregnancy ; and of the same happening to men from vexation of mind, and of Negroes losing their colour from old age and disease.

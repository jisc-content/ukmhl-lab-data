ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY, 180 There are generally two testes only, but sometimes there are three. The testes, at the period of puberty, are larger than in old age. The testes are protected from external injury by a con- tinuation of the peritonaeum, which forms what has been cal- led the Tunica Vaginalis Testis, is connected with the cre- master muscle and the inner surface of the scrotum by loose cellular substance. The tunica vaginalis is, upon inflation, found to be more capacious than the body of the testicle ; it includes the body * of the testicle and epidydimis, and its surface is besmeared by a serous fluid. This coat being reflected, forms a white coat, commonly called Tunica albuginea, which adheres in- timately to the body of the testicle, and, though very smooth externally, is found to be internally very unequal on its sur- face. The body of the testicle is divided into two parts; into the larger anterior and rounded part, called body, and into an ob- long process, or posterior part, called Epidydimis, both of which are covered by the tunica albuginea ; which is the bond of union between these parts, and also serves to conduct their bloodvessels. The body of the testis is of a pulpy yellowish substance, and consists of a series of very small tubes, which are intersected by small ligamentous chords passing from one side of the tu- nica albuginea to the other. The minute elastic convoluted tubes of the testicle may be separated from each other by a fine needle, or by steeping the testicle in water, whereby it is converted into a substance like a bunch of cotton. My Father, with the view' of discovering the structure of this gland, threw a penetrating injection into the spermatic artery, but could not discover any appearance of acini at the terminations of the arteries. The testes, therefore, are glands of a very simple construc- tion. According to my Father, the seminiferous tubes of the

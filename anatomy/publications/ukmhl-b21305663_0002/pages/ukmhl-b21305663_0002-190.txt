The lowest part of the bladder is a depression between the base of the trigone, and the posterior part of that organ, in which small particles of sand, or urinary concretions, are very often imbedded. The neck is the most sensible part of the bladder : the mo- ment the point of a bougie touches it, the patient has a desire to void his urine, though there be little or no urine at the time in the bladder. Owing to the same cause, patients afflicted by stone in the bladder experience acute pain when they get out of bed, from the stone falling down upon the neck of the bladder. Over that part of the bladder called by Lieutaud, Tri- gone, in the recent body, we always observe the inner mem- brane of the bladder of a pale red colour, owing to the num- ber of small vessels which are distributed upon that part of the mucous membrane. Of Diverticula from the Bladder of Urine. The more usual form of the bladder has been already de- scribed. In a few instances, there are processes or diverticula connected with it, which are similar in appearance and struc- ture to those which grow from the intestines. These diverticula are connected with different parts of the bladder, and have been more particularly noticed by Hal- ler *, and also by Paletta*}-. A representation is given, in my Morbid Anatomy of the Stomach and Intestines, of an instance of a hernia of the bladder, in which there existed such a diverticulum from the bladder of urine. Of Deficiency or Mai conformation of the Bladder. There arc instances in which the bladder has been entirely wanting, and in which the ureters terminated in the intesti- num rectum or in the vagina. â€¢ Opera Pathol. Obs. 41- t Exercit.

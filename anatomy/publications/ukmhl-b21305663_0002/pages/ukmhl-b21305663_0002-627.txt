OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS. 593 creas, and enter into the thoracic duct, nearly opposite to the origin of die coeliac artery. The lymphatic vessels of the spleen, in their course, unite with the lymphatics of the stomach, and those descending from the under part of the liver, and form an intricate plexus; from which plexus, a number of lymphatic vessels pass off in different directions, some passing over, and others under, the duodenum : and, ultimately these lymphatic vessels terminate in the thoracic duct about its middle. Of the Ly mphatic Vessels of the Kidneys. The lymphatic vessels of the kidneys are disposed in two sets, a superficial and a deeper-seated set. The superficial are spread over the kidney in a radiated form ; and, general- ly, they may be observed covering the renal vein. The superficial and deeper-seated lymphatic vessels of the kidneys unite at the thinner edge of this bowel, and form a plexus, which accompanies the renal arteries and vein, after which they enter into the lumbar glands. The lymphatic vessels of the renal capsules end in the re- nal plexus of lymphatic vessels. Of the Lymphatic Vessels of the Lungs and Heart. There are two sets of lymphatic vessels proper to the lungs, a superficial and deeper-seated set. The former describe are- olae between the lobules of the lungs, or form a sort of net- work ; and they pass into the bronchial glands, where they' are joined by the deeper-seated lymphatic vessels, which ac- company the branches of the trachea and pulmonary artery. There are some of the absorbent vessels of the left Jung' which pass through glands behind the arch of the aorta. The lymphatic vessels which have passed through the bron- chial glands, form trunks, which ascend on the fore-paft of: the vena cava superior, and terminate in Steno’s duct on the' right side of the neck. The lymphatic vessels of the human heart are very small, and rarely visible excepting in cases of disease’. o o 2

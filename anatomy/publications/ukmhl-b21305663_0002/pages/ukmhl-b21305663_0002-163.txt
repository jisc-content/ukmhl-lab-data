OF THE KIDNEYS. rv A HE kidneys ave those organs by which the urine is secre- ted ; thus the balance is preserved between the quantity of liquor we drink, and the quantity of the circulating fluid. Through these glands that part of the blood which is su- perfluous is discharged. The kidneys are situated in the lumbar region behind the peritonEeum, on each side of the spine, and lie upon the dia- phragm, the larger psoae, quadrati lumborum, and transver- sales abdominis muscles, and extend from the eleventh rib nearly~to the cristae of the os ilium. Owing to the difference between the bulk of the right lobe of the liver and the spleen, the right kidney (supposing the body to be erect) is rather lower than the left. The kidneys are, in a certain degree, retained in their situation by the re- flected peritonaeum, and by cellular substances. The perito- naeum passing from the right kidney to the liver, is said to form the right ligament, and on the left side, the peritonaeum extending from the spleen, is said to form the ligament of the left kidney. There are a few instances, (I have seen five of them), in which a transverse portion of a substance, in all re- spects similar to the rest of the kidneys, connected the lower portions of the kidneys of opposite sides, thereby forming one

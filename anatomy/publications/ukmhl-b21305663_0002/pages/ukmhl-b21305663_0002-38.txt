12 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. tion upwards and downwards, remaining nearly parallel to each other, oblique muscles are preferred to straight; for if the former can, as I have before demonstrated, perform more extensive motion than the latter, even where both are of the same length, they must have a still greater effect, where the two kinds of muscles are confined between the same paral- lels. “ Thus, suppose the direct distance, or perpendicular drawn from one rib to another, to be represented by three parts; and that the intercostal muscle, in consequence of its obliquity, measures five such parts ; and that each of these is capable, when in action, of shortening itself one-fifth part of its length; it appears from the demonstration, that the ob- lique muscle can move the rib through a space five times greater than the straight muscle can do. “ On accurate mensuration, I found the length of the in- tercostal muscle to be one inch and a half, the perpendicular line one inch, and the base about one and one-eighth inch. Hence, calculating on the supposition, that the muscular fi- bre, in action, shortens itself one-fifth of its length, it will be found, that the intercostal muscles, in consequence of their obliquity, produce a greater motion of the ribs than perpendi- cular muscles could have done, nearly in the proportion of 35 to 12. “ The only point remaining to be explained, is, why Na- ture hath formed two layers of intercostal muscles decussating each other. “ The purpose of this, I apprehend, is to render the mo- tion of the rib upwards as direct as possible, and to prevent it from being drawn or pressed forwards upon the sternum, or backwards upon the vertebrae, so much as, by its friction, to interrupt the freedom of its motion. “ Upon the whole, by the obliquity of the intercostal mus- cles, the motion of the ribs is very much greater than could have been performed by straight muscles placed between them. At the same time, by their consisting of two lay- ers, or two muscles decussating and balancing each other, the motion of the ribs, upwards and downwards, is as direct,

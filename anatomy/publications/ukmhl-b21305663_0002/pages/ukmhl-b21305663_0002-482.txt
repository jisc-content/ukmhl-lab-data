ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY". eye-ball, for the purpose of keeping it moist, and for facilita- ting its movements. It seems probable that the ducts of the lacrymal gland possess a contractile power, otherwise the tears could not be forced through these ducts. The tears pass across the eye, are diffused by the motion of the eye-ball, and are absorbed by the puncta lacrymalia. Of the Puncta Lacrymalia *. There are two puncta lacrymalia, a superior and inferior, through which the tears pass into the lacrymal sac : these ca- nals are not exactly cylindrical, and are narrowest at their orifices, which open on the surface of the eye-lids. Each punctum is surrounded by a cartilaginous border, by which it is kept always open. The superior punctum is placed near to the internal angle of the upper eye-lid: it ascends for about one-eighth of an inch, and then turns inwards at a right angle, and descends obliquely to meet with its fellowr. The inferior punctum passes downwards, describes a right angle, and then passes obliquely upwards to join the punctum of the upper eye- lid. The puncta pass along the margin of the eye-lids,, and approach each other : they are separated by the caruncle, and sometimes form a common duct behind the tendon of the orbicularis muscle ; but, in most cases, the puncta open into the lacrymal sac separately rf- ; and these canals are lined by a. mucous membrane. The tears are absorbed by the puncta, in consequence of capillary attraction, and conveyed through the ducts into the lacrymal sac. Of the Lacrymal Sac. The lacrymal sac is lodged in a groove formed by the os unguis and os maxillarej. This sac is of an irregular form, • Vide Plate VI. of my Father’s Treatise on the Eye and Lacrymal Ducts. -)• Vide a Description of these ducts in Dr Monko senior's Observat.

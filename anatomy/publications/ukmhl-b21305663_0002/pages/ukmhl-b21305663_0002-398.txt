ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 352 mater intimately, and may be detached readily from either, by inflation, especially at the base of the brain, where this coat is naturally detached from the other membranes. In very early life, this coat is so thin as to be pellucid ; and it adheres so intimately to the pia mater, that it can scarcely be separated from it; but in very advanced life, it becomes thicker and semiopaque. On account of the extreme thinness of this membrane, it is difficult to detect its structure. I am inclined to suppose it a serous membrane; for, like other serous membranes, it forms a bag, without an external opening, and gives a lining to the vessels and nerves; has a smooth surface, which is lubricated by a serous fluid ; is subject to the same organic derangements as membranes of that description, and is sometimes thickened. It adheres to the other membranes, and sometimes has been ossified. There are no vessels proper to this coat, which are of such a size as to admit the red blood. It is yet doubtful, whether absorbent vessels be proper to this coat or not. The effusion of a watery fluid often takes place between the membranes of the brain, without occasioning any morbid symptom; and hence the presumption that it has taken place slowly. It is proper to add, that, in comatose affections, I often re- marked an effusion, to a considerable extent, between the membranes of the brain, when, at the same time, there was a slight thickening of this coat, which, in colour, very much re- sembled the mineral called Opal. This membrane covers the veins which enter the superior longitudinal sinus; it descends on each side of the falx, and covers the corpus callosum. By some authors it has been said to line the ventricles of the brain. This membrane also incloses the olfactory and optic nerves, and the infundibulum.

486 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. According to the experiments of Mr Hatchett, hairs are composed oi gelatine and coagulated albumen; and he has observed, that such hair as is softest and most flexible, and loses its curl in moist weather, most readily gives out albumen on Vauquelin has stated there are two kinds of oil in hair; one of which varies with ihe colour of the hair: black hair yields black oil; the other is white. In hair, sulphur, phosphate and carbonate of lime, iron, and manganese, are contained. Of the Sixth Sense.

This sense, it has been said, communicates that internal corporeal feeling which creates a sense of lassitude or fatigue unconnected with muscular exertion or disease, or the more agreeable sensation of lightness or buoyancy. But it seems more probable, that such sensations are rather to be imputed to the state of nervous sensibility, than to an additional sense. OF THE NERVES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. In describing the senses of Smell, Vision, Hearing and Tasting, several of the nerves of the head have been already mentioned. Two of the great parts of the fifth pair yet re- main to be described, the Superior and Inferior Maxillary Nerves. It was stated, that a ganglion, or rather plexus, called Gasserian, was thrown across the fifth pair. As this re- markable pair has lately excited much attention, and as a

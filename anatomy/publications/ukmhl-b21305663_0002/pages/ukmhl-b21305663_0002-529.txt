OF THE SEBACEOUS GLANDS OF THE SKIN. 483 In some parts of the body there are small rounded bodies under the skin : the ducts of these glands, which are large, open on the surface. These ducts are most obvious in the nose of the male, and a sebaceous matter may be squeezed out from them. But there are other parts of the surface, from which no such sebaceous matter can be expressed, nor are the sebace- ous glands to be found. The quantity of matter perspired is greater than that of all the other excretions; it varies in different climates; the warmer and drier the climate, cceterisparibus, the greater the quantity of perspiration. Sanctorius, who made many experiments upon the quan- tity perspired, has stated, that, on an average, 51b. passed off by perspiration, when he took 8 lb. of food. With regard to the chemical nature of the matter which is perspired, we are yet in the dark : it evidently contains a good deal of water; and from the very peculiar odour of the mat- ter perspired, it contains a good deal of animal matter ; and, according to Cruickshanks and Berthollet, the phospho- ric acid. Some authors have supposed that the skin produces on the air the same changes as the lungs. The skin is amply supplied by nerves, and is exquisitely sensible. Large nerves can be traced into it; more especially towards the extremities of the fingers and toes. Whether new skin is formed from the edge of the original skin, or from the surface of granulations, is doubtful. We see it distinctly growing from the edge of the original skin. We see also sometimes an appearance of little islands of skin, formed on the surface of an ulcer. New formed skin is less vascular than the original skin. New skin is not so strong, and is apt to burst out. Of Hair. Hair is proper to all the class Mammalia, not excepting whales and dugongs. It differs greatly in quantity, quality it h 2

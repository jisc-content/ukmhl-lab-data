OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 321 The brain of the ox does not weigh above one-fourth of the human brain; yet the nerves connected with it are six times laro-er; or they are twenty-four times larger than they should have been, supposing that in both the whole white part of the brain were sent out from the head in the form of nerves. Hence the whole brain is not intended to form nerves ; and after making such a conclusion in respect to the human brain, it seems probable, that, in the inferior animals, a part of the brain is destined for different purposes than those performed by nerves ; an opinion which gains weight, from the circum- stance that the destruction of a part of the brain is not fol- lowed by a loss of feeling, or of the power of motion. The nerves have three coats, the Dura Mater, the Arach- noid Coat, and the Pia Mater; and besides these, each nerve has a membrane which is proper to its component fila- ments, called the neurilma : this may be readily shewn, by immersing a nerve in an alkaline solution, by which the medullary mater is .removed : thus the nerve looks like a bundle of hollow tubes. The internal surface of the neurilma is smooth and polished, like the innermost coat of an artery or vein ; it sends out several small processes, which are con- nected with the white matter of the nerve. The nerves, when minutely examined, are found to be com- posed of fibres, and each fibre is composed of a number of minute fibrils of the same nature as those of the brain and spinal cord ; but they are much more distinct, and are enve- loped in their proper membrane. Leeuwenhoek observed, by the aid of his microscope, that the most minute fibre resembles a larger bundle, and he was not satisfied that he was looking upon one single fibre, but probably had in view a bundle of small fibres. Reill, who devoted much attention to the minute struc- ture of the nerves, describes them as composed of very fine filaments of different thickness, some like those of a hair, and others like those of silk, which are inclosed in a very fine web, which he has called neurilma. T have examined with some care transverse sections of nerve, and especially those of the optic nerves of the horse and goose, votâ€ž it. x

Frere Jacques had the merit of introducing what has been called the lateral operation of' lithotomy; and it was so named, because the side of the urethra, near to the bladder, is divided. I subjoin the following observations on lithotomy, from a manuscript in my possession, drawn up by Mr Smith of ' Perth, whose case-book contains a list of 120 persons, on whom he had operated in the course of twenty years; of which number 54 were children. “ While I was apprentice to Mr Murray of Glencarse, I observed several patients come to him that were troubled with the stone in their bladder, which he declined cutting; that opeiation being then practised by no regular bred sur geon in Scotland, only by rude illiterate fellows, and that by the gripe or apparatus minor, I resolved, when at Pai’is, during 1703 and 1704, to get some knowledge of the method there used.

OF THE DIAPHRAGM. 13 and with as little friction, as if it had been performed by straight or perpendicular muscles.” Of the Diaphragm, and of the poivers by which expiration is performed. This muscle forms the partition between the thorax and abdomen. This muscle is convex towards the thorax during expira- tion, and concave towards the abdomen. It is composed of two distinct muscles, called the Larger or Upper, and the Under or Smaller Diaphragm. The larger diaphragm takes its rise from the ensiform cartilage, from the cartilages of the seventh and lower ribs on both sides; and the fleshy fibres meet in a central tendon, which somewhat resembles the heart in figure. On the right side of this central tendon, there is an aperture for the vena cava inferior. The edges of this foramen are rounded and tendinous, therefore, there is no risk of the blood being impeded in its progress to the heart through the vena cava inferior. There is in some individuals a small fissure in the dirphragm, which is filled by fat and cellular membrane. When this fissure has attained a con- siderable bulk, a portion of the transverse arch of the colon sometimes passes through it, and is strangulated, which proves the cause of death *. This muscle is covered next the chest by the pleura, and next the abdomen by the peritonaeum. The smaller diaphragm takes its rise by four crura of un- equal length. The longer crura arise from the fore-part of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and adhere to all the vertebrae of the loins, by means of a strong ligament. Between these crura, there is an oval-shaped aperture for the aorta, thoracic duct, and great splanchnic nerve. The muscular fibres of the several origins of this muscle ascend, and in the middle unite, so as to form two fleshy co- lumns, which cross each other; and between these the gullet • Vide a case of this kind described in my Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet,.

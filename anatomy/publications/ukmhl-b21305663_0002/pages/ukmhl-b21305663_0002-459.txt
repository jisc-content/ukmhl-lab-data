413 OF THE CRYSTALLINE LENS. which is more convex behind than before; but in old age it frequently acquires a greater firmness, and a topaz colour. According to Zinn, the lens, at the twenty-fifth or thirtieth year, acquires a degree of yellowness, which gradually in- creases as age advances; so that, at length, it becomes like a piece of amber. 'I his yellowness, he adds, he has often ob- served to begin in the centre of the lens. Zixn has also remarked, p. 130, that it often happens that there is no difference as to the colour, firmness, or convexity, of the eyes of the old and young. Petit has been at great pains in measuring the convexity of the anterior and posterior part of the lens. My Father * has remarked upon these measurements :— “ Petit has stated, that the radii of the anterior part of the lens may be the same in two different lenses, but the radii of the posterior are different, and yet the breadth and thickness the same; but if the posterior radius be longer, the lens must be flatter and thinner; and if shorter, the lens must be more con- vex and thicker.” The lens is found to be composed of albumen, jelly, and a little water. It has been a matter of doubt, whether or not it be possi- ble to trace any bloodvessels into the substance of the crystal- line lens. I have injected a branch of the central artery of the reti- na, which passed through the vitreous humour: when it reached the back part of the capsule of the lens, it sent a num- ber of small branches to the circumference of the lens; but I never could distinctly trace any one branch of that artery into the substance of the lens. It is not possible to detect the nerves of the lens. The crystalline lens is a soft tender substance, of unequal density : in the centre it is firmer, tougher and heavier, than in its circumference; and hence possesses a more equal refrac- tive power than any artificial lens.

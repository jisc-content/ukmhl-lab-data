426 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Of the Ophthalmic, or Lenticular Ganglion. Zinn has thus accurately described this ganglion *. “ Ganglion ergo illud omnium fere in corpore humano mi- nimum, rubellum, fere quadratum longius tamen quum la- tius, utroque latere compressum, ab interna parte qua ner- vum opticum spectat planiusculum, ab externa conversum, adsidet externo latere nervi optici aliquot lineas ab ejus in- gressu, cui nervo multa cellulosa jungitur, etpinguedine mul- to fluidiori involutum, sub communi origine musculi attollen- tis, et capitis minoris musculi abducentis illique subjecto adi- pe ita latet, ut nisi musculo abducente prope ortum discisso, rite observari non possit.” The ciliary nerves, which are ten or twelve in number, are derived from the ophthalmic ganglion. These are very small, not larger than the hairs of the head. These nerves accom- o pany the optic nerve, and enter the posterior part of the eye- ball obliquely, through the sclerotic coat. When they lie between the sclerotic coats they are flat. At the ciliary cir- cle each nerve is subdivided into two branches, and at the root of the iris, these are subdivided into still smaller branches, which follow a radiated course; and near to the pupil they are united and form arches, from which very minute filaments pass to the margin of the iris. Mr Charles Bell has made f a number of very inge- nious observations on the actions of the muscles ol the eye, which are highly worthy of the attention of the reader; and also upon the nerves of the orbit J. According to Mr Bell, i( The third nerve goes to the muscles of the eye ; it is a voluntary nerve, by which the eye is directed to objects. « The fourth nerve performs the insensible traversing mo- tions of the eye-ball. It combines the motions of the eye- - De Oculo, page 204. + Vide Phil. Trans, for 1823, Part L p. 176, &c. J Vide idem, Part ii. p. 294. &c.

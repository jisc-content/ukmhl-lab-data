410 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. • Edinburgh Journal of Science, vol. i. p. 81. Its appearance is, in all respects, so evidently muscular, that I think there can be no doubt of its being the sphincter of the pupil: And I can only account for its having escaped the observation of Ur Haller and Dr Wrisberg, by sup- posing that they had not washed off the black paint, which covers and conceals it, as well as the red vessels of the iris.” In the human body, fibres are seen around the pupil on its fore and also on its back part, and the space between these fibres and root of the iris is filled up with vessels and radiated fibres. These fibres are.not equally apparent in all instances, and they are much more distinct in the leopard than in any other animal I have examined. The^ris was supposed to contract merely by its elasticity, but this opinion cannot be admitted. As a proof of muscular power, observe that, in the mori- bund, the pupil attains an extrordinary size, but immediately after death it contracts, which could not be owing to mere elasticity. Farther, in hydrocephalic children, the pupil, owing to its insensible state, is dilated, when a candle is applied to the eye. Dr Brewster has concluded *, that the “ power of adjust- ing the eye depends on the mechanism, which contracts and dilates the pupil, and since this adjustment is independent of the variation of its aperture, it must be effected by the parts which are in immediate contact with the base of the iris.” The iris divides the aqueous humour into two chambers, an anterior and posterior: the anterior is placed between the posterior surface of the cornea and the anterior part of the iris. The posterior chamber is situated between the posterior surface of the iris, and the anterior part of the crystalline lens. The iris receives its blood by the long ciliary arteries. These arteries converge towards the pupil, and when they approach it, they separate, and form portions of circles around the pupil.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 278 tra. From this artery, the pancreas, omentum and mesoco- lon receive several small branches. There are four or fire branches of the splenic artery, called rasa brevia, which are spent on the great left sac of the stomach, and anastomose with the branches of the left superior and left inferior gastric arteries. The HEPATIC BRANCH of tllC CCELIAC ARTERY, is leSS than the splenic artery, and is concealed by the pancreas. It passes forwards and upwards behind the lesser curva- ture of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum ; and, near to the neck of the gall-bladder, divides into the Gastrica In- ferior decctra, and the proper Hepatic Artery. This artery, in the capsule of Glysson, is situated between the vena portae and ductus communis choledochus. Many persons experience a pulsation in the region of the stomach, which proves very alarming to them : this, according to Morgagni *, is -owing to an enlargement of the heart, which descends lower than usual, pressing before it the diaphragm, and forcing forwards the liver. This pulsation is often unconnected with any or- ganic disease in any part of the arterial system, and proceeds from the pulsation being communicated from the subjacent ar- tery to a tumour that lies over it; which tumour is often oc- casioned by an enlargement of the lacteal glands at the root of the mesentery. From the gastrica dextra, the following branches are de- rived : The Arteria Pylorica, which supplies the pylorus: The duodenalis, which is dispersed on the right portion of the duo- denum : Small branches to the pancreas. The trunk of the artery then passes along the great cur- vature of the stomach, and anastomoses with the arteria epi- ploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. The hepatic artery, during its progress along the great curvature of the stomach, is subdivided into the following branches: * Vide 17th Letter, Art. 28.

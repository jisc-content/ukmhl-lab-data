OF THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. 9 of the pectoral muscle, the extremities of the long thoracic arteries are distributed. Under the greater, the lesser pectoral muscle is situated. The sides of the thorax are covered by the serrated muscle, called scrratus anticus major. Upon removing the serratus anticus major, the oblique muscular fibres between the ribs, called intercostal muscles, come into view. When the muscles of the thorax have been removed, the student should attend to the oblique direction of the ribs in respect to the spine; and that, upon the ribs being raised, their cartilages are twisted: hence, when the force is removed by which the ribs were elevated, they regain their original situation, in consequence of the elastic reaction of their carti- lages, which fix them to the breast-bone, or to each other. Of the Muscles by which Inspiration is accomplished. The muscles more immediately concerned in inspiration are, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm. Of the Intercostal Muscles. There are two strata of intercostal muscles, which are ob- lique muscles, and have their fibres crossing each other. The external stratum arises from the under edge of each rib, excepting the twelfth ; runs obliquely downwards and forwards from the spine to the union of the ribs with their cartilages, and is fixed into the upper edge of each rib. There are portions of the external intercostal muscles which arise from the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and have been named levatores costarum breviores et longiores. The origin of the internal intercostal muscles is similar to that of the external. They run downwards and backwards, crossing the former stratum, and are continued as far as the angles of the ribs. The external stratum is not found between the cartilages O of the ribs and the breast-bone ; nor the internal stratum be- tween the angles of the ribs and spine. My Father discovered, that both strata are subservient to

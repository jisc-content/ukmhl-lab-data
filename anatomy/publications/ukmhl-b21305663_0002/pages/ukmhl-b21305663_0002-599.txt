OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 551 “ I think I likewise remember the observations on inocula- ted patients; though I cannot be positive with respect to this or the other examples you have made use of. Upon the whole, your Latin Dissertation seems to me to contain the same mat- ter, and that treated in the same manner, as the Essay I read in the year 1755. And, though you may have, no doubt, improved upon that Essay in your Dissertation, I must con- fess, I received as dear an idea of your doctrine, and as full a conviction of its truth, from that Essay, as 1 have received since. “ I am.

As the lacteal and lymphatic vessels con- stitute parts of the same system, and are similar as to size, structure, and function, I shall describe the whole under one head.

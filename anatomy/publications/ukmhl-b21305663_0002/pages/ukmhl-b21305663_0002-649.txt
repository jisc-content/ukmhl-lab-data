OF THE FCETUS. â‚¬15 which occupies a larger space in the abdomen, and the small size of the pelvis at that early period of life. On recurring to the description of the intestinum rectum, I observe that I have omitted to describe the course of the rec- tum of the foetus, which, as far as I know, has not been de- scribed with sufficient accuracy. This bowel in the foetus is proportionally smaller than in the adult, and more especially in the vicinity of the anus. It follows the same course as the rectum for a certain way only, as far down as the third piece of that bone ; from which place it makes a semicir- cle, the convexity of which is forwards, or the lower part of the rectum keeps the opposite course from the same bowel of the adult. From the preceding description of the contents of the Preg- nant Womb, as given in Chapters I. and II., the following inferences may be drawn, regarding the various causes of death of the foetus, when no blame can be attached to the mother. These merit attention, from their more immediate refer- ence to the study of Forensic Medicine. In the first place, Experience has shewn, that children born before the fifth month are not born alive; and also, that children born before the seventh month seldom, or never, ar- rive at maturity. 2d, There are some foetuses so formed as to be incapable of an independent existence; of this denomination are va- rious monsters, born without a head, &c. &c. In the third place, The foetus may be destroyed by dis- eases which occur to the mother during her pregnancy, or by diseases incident to itself. When the foetus is feeble or delicate, it often dies as soon as it is born. I have met with several instances, in which children were born with water in the head; some of the patients survived vol. n. q q

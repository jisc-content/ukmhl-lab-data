108 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. considerable degree ; and thinks the warm air from the lungs of a living person will be most conveniently employed at first; but, when it is not soon effectual, in restoring the respiration of the drowned person, and that a longer continuance of the inflation is necessary, it may be proper to employ a pair of bellows, large enough at once to contain the quantity of air necessary to inflate the lungs to a due degree. “ Whether the blowing in is done by a person’s moutb,or by bellows, Dr Monro observes, that the air is ready to pass by the gullet into the stomach ; but that this may be prevent- ed, by pressing the lower part of the larynx backwards upon the^gullet. To persons of a little knowledge in anatomy, it is to be observed, that the pressure should be only on the cri- coid cartilage, by which the gullet may be strained, while the passage through the larynx is not interrupted. “ When, by blowing thus into the nostril, it can be per- ceived, by the raising of the chest or belly, that the lungs are filled with air, the blowing in should cease; and, by pressing the breast and belly, the air received into the lungs should be again expelled; then the blowing and expulsion should be again repeated; and thus the practice is to be continued, so as to imitate, as exactly as possible, the alternate motions of natural respiration. iC It is hardly necessary to observe, that, when the blowing into the nostril is practised, the other nostril and the mouth should be accurately closed. “ If it should happen, that, in this practice, the air does not seem to pass readily into the lungs, Dr Monro informs me, it is very practicable to introduce directly into the glottis and trachea a crooked tube, such as the catheter used for a male adult. For this he offers the following directions: The surgeon should place himself on the right side of the patient, and introducing the fore-finger of his left hand at the right corner of the patient’s mouth, he should push the point of it behind the epiglottis ; and, using this as a directory, he may enter the catheter, which he holds in his right hand, at the left corner of the patient’s mouth, till the end of it is passed beyond the point of his fore-finger; and it is then to be let

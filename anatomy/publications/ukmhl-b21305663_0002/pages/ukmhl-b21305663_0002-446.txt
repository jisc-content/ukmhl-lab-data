ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 400 ten disappeared and again returned, with alternations so ra- pid, as to produce a twinkling, very like that of a fixed star. â€œ Sometimes, on examining an individual specimen, it would disappear altogether, but in a few minutes return, re- new its twinkling, and apparent revolution an its axis, and again disappear, to return as before Of the Corpus ciliare. Nearly opposite to the ciliary circle, there is a dark-brown radiated circle, about one-sixth of an inch broad, called Cor- pus ciliare; and, near to the connection of the corpus ciliare with the root of the iris, the choroid coat is folded into sixty or seventy.folds, which are lined by dark paint. The corpus ciliare is not a muscular organ, but consists chiefly of a very minute plexus of bloodvessels, the continua- tion of the ciliary artery. The corpus ciliare is fixed to the retina at the fore-part of the vitreous humour, and, a little behind, to the edge of the crystalline lens. The branches of the larger ciliary arteries, after having perforated the sclerotic coat, pass along the outer surface of this coat, and divide into branches at the ciliary circle ; and, upon the surface of this coat, there are also veins which de- scribe segments of a circle, and have been called therefore Vena verticosa. The nerves, called Ciliary, which are flat, may be observed passing along the surface of this coat, accompanied by the long ciliary arteries; and the ramifications of the shorter ciliary arteries also perforate the sclerotic coat, near to the entrance of the optic nerve ; run along a part of this coat, af- terwards perforate it, and are distributed on its internal vil- lous surface. Of the Ciliary Ligament or Ciliary Circle. The ciliary ligament is placed a little more than a line be- hind the cornea, and composed of dense cellular substance, * Vide Trans, of the Royal Society of Edin. vol. vii. 377.

OF THE CELLS OF THE LUNGS. 93 live argument that many other cells have no branch of the trachea directly terminating in them. In the human body the communications of the lobules are more numerous than in many quadrupeds, as in the pe- cora, and hence the division into lobules is less distinct and beautiful in us. When we consider the explanation which has now been given of the intimate structure of the lungs, it appears that the internal surface of the air-cells is nearly thirty times greater than that of the whole external surface of the body. Thus the air-vesicles being only one-eightieth of an inch in their diameter, there will be 512,000 of them in one cubic inch. If, next, we suppose that the cells are of a cubical shape, which we may do without a material error, the sides of the cells will be six times more numerous than the cells, or their number in a cubic inch will be 3,072,000 ; and if, from this number, we deduct one-third, on account of the holes by which the cells communicate with each other, two millions of membranes remain, each of them equal to the square of one-eightieth of an inch, or the surfaces of the whole will be equal to 312 square inches, or upwards of two square feet; and, as our lungs in a full inspiration contain about 220 cubic inches of air, the whole internal surfaces cf the lungs will be nearly equal to 44-0 square feet, or nearly thirty times greater than that of the whole external surface of the bodyy which is generally supposed to be equal to fifteen square feet. I found, that by the elegant subdivisions and folds of the membrane of the gills, in a large skate, their surface is nearly equal to the whole external surface of the human body. Thus, in each side of the body of a skate, there are four double gills, or gills with two sides each, and one single gill; or there are in all eighteen sides or surfaces on which the bronchial artery is spread out. On each of these sides there are about fifty divisions, or doublings of the membrane of the gills, (f) Each division has on each side of it 160 subdivi- sions, doublings or folds, of its membrane; the length of each of which in a very large skate is about one-eighth of an inch, and its breadth about one-sixteenth of an inch, (g) So that

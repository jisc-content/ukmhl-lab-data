328 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. rent from the coats of the nerves going into the ganglia; hence there is just reason to suppose, that nervous matter is Jurnished by the ganglia. Sixthly, To strengthen the sup- position, that the ganglia are to be considered as sources of nervous matter and energy, I would observe, that the yellow- ish, or brownish matter of ganglia, has numerous vessels con- veying red blood, as in the cortical substance of the brain, dispersed upon it. That its colour, especially in man, very much resembles the cortical substance of the brain. That in several children, in' whom the brain had either been original- ly imperfect, or compressed by accident, its colour and con- sistence still more closely resembled that of a ganglion, as to the greater hardness of the ganglia, than that of the cortical substance, which, to Dr Meckel, has appeared to afford suf- ficient reason for denying that they serve for secretion ; that, I apprehend, will evidently appear necessary, to defend them from external violence, or the pressure of the muscles, and other organs. To which I would add an observation on the first pair, or olfactory nerves, which seems to carry with it considerable weight, to-wit, that, in man, the trunk of the ol- factory nerve haw adhering to its end, a cineritious bulb, si- tuated within the cranium, and which is evidently of the same texture with the cortical matter of the brain. Now, in fishes, I have found, that the olfactory nerve has no such bulb with- in the cranium, but when we trace that nerve forward, to- wards the nose, which is in them at a great distance from the cranium, we find a ganglion, near the nose, which supplies the place of this bulb, and from which more nerves come out than enter in.'1 Having premised these general observations, relative to the disposition and structure of the nerves, it seems necessary to subjoin a few remarks on their functions. The nerves are the organs that intervene between the living principle and the rest of the body, through which various im- pressions are propagated. The feeling is not resident in the nerve * ; it is merely a con- â€¢ A physiologist of eminence has, by dividing the phrenic nerve of horses, en- deavoured to prove, that the nerves retract after having been divided, and that

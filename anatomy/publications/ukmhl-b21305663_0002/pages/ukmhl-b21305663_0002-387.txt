or THE BRAIN. 341 The colour of the substance of the brain is destroyed by- maceration in water, in acids, or alcohol. The weight of the brain of a full grown man weighs about three pounds avoirdupois; that of a woman is somewhat less. Messrs Wenzel have paid great attention ' to this depart- ment of anatomy, and have published a very interesting Ta- ble, of which the subjoined is an extract. Age. Weight of whole Brain.

This holds true, excepting with respect to the elephant and larger cetacea. But when we compare the bulk of the brain in respect to the body, many exceptions to the above observation present themselves. According to Buffon, that of the seal bears a greater pro- portion to the rest of the body; and, according to Cuvier, the same holds true in respect to the mole and to many birds : further, the brain of the elephant, and of horned animals re- markable for their sagacity, is, in proportion to the bulk of their bodies, below the average standard. I subscribe entirely to the sentiments of Mr Lawrence on this point. He says, “ It must be acknowledged, that the inquiries into the re- lative weight of the brain and the body, and the comparison between the former and the nerves connected with it, have

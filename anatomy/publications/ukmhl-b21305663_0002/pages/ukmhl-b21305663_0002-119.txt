89 OF THE CELLS OF THE LUNGS. □lands, near the termination of the thoracic duct, which ap- peared to transmit some of the lymphatics of the lungs in their course to the heart. Nav, I have at last, after looking for the appearance in se- veral subjects, found a black matter in the lymphatic vessels of one subject, between the substance of the lungs, and the bronchial glands: and in another, without squeezing the glands, I observed some of the black matter between them and the heart. SECTION III. OF THE CELLS OF THE HUMAN LUNGS. The preceding observations on the bronchial glands, and the following on the minute structure of the lungs, were writ- ten by my Father, and read to the Royal Society, at a meet- ing held January 1767. As they contain all the knowledge we now possess of the structure of the lungs, I trust they may not be unacceptable to the reader. Upon examining the cells of the lungs when they have been filled with air, wax or quicksilver, they are found to be very small. In a child of a year old, they are about the T^5th of an inch in diameter, and in an adult they do not exceed the j ’ 5th or gUth part of an inch in diameter. Their figure is ir- regular, and not the same in any two of them; vid. Plate IV. and V. The diameter of the branches of bronchi which open into the cells, is nearly equal to that of the cells, or in an adult these are somewhat more than the T5Sth part of an inch in diameter *. Each cell has not a branch of the bronchi opening into it. This, in the first place, might be inferred from observing, that if air is blown into a very small branch of the bronchi, it fills a much greater number of cells than are proportioned • Dr Hiller supposes they are so small as to be invisible.

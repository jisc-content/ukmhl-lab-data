ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 198 tachmcnts of the triangular ligament and of the levator ure- thrae muscle of Mr Wilson of London are preserved. The contents of the pelvis of the male are,â€”the bladder of urine, and its connecting ligaments, with a portion of the ureters, the intestinum rectum, the vasa deferentia, vesiculae seminales, and prostate gland, together with the fat, cellu- lar substance, muscles, membranes, ligaments, bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbent vessels proper to these parts. After removing the greater share of one of the ossa inno- minata, it is not easjr to distinguish the several bowels of the pelvis, unless a sound be passed into the bladder, and unless the bladder of urine and rectum be somewhat distended with air. On tracing the peritonaeum, we find it descending in the male from the navel towards the ossa pubis, covering the shrivelled umbilical arteries and urachus. It covers the pos- terior surfaces of the recti and pyramidales muscles, and is then reflected upon the upper and fore part of the bladder of urine, from which it passes backwards, as far as the base of the vesiculae seminales, and it is reflected to the anterior surface of the upper part of the intestinum rectum, but, it may be observed, that the place of the reflection is by no means uniform in all cases. This reflection of the peritomeum has been said by some authors to constitute the posterior ligament or ligaments of the bladder. The rectum, at its lower part, and also at its sides, is co- vered by the peritonaeum, which membrane, being continued behind that bowel, forms what has been called the Meso-rec- tum, by which it is. fixed to the os sacrum. Considering the very limited plan of this elementary work, I must content myself by adding a few very general observa- tions respecting the puncturing and cutting into the bladder, omitting entirely all remarks upon the striking degree of sympathy which exists between the bowels of the pelvis; the influence of remedies thrown into the rectum upon the blad- der, and womb; the effect of the displacement, or increased bulk of any one bowel in deranging the functions of the con-

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 570 sels of the inferior extremities, and by the lacteal vessels of the smaller intestines; and it is between sixteen and twenty inches lono-. O It varies in its size, course and termination, in different in- dividuals. It is much larger in some individuals, at its ori- gin, than in other persons. This duct takes its rise from the receptacle of the chyle, an oval-shaped bag, which lies over the second and third verte- brae of the loins. In this duct there is not the same number of valves as in other parts of the lymphatic system. This duct sometimes follows a tortuous course, or it forms what have been called Islands: hence, though the principal trunk be obstructed, the flow of the chyle is not always im- peded. The thoracic duct frequently splits into two branches; one of which enters the subclavian vein, and the other the inter- nal jugular. The thoracic duct is firmly fixed down to the spine; it passes at first behind the aorta ; it then passes a little to the right side, till it arrives in front of the first vertebra of the loins: it then perforates the diaphragm, behind its right crus, and in the posterior mediastinum: it is placed between the aorta and vena azygos. The thoracic duct becomes gradually larger as it ascends from the seventh dorsal vertebra: in the chest the lympha- tic vessels of the intercostal spaces, and which accompany the intercostal arteries, unite with it; and it receives also several lymphatic vessels from the lungs. When the thoracic duct has ascended as high as the third or fourth dorsal vertebra, it passes obliquely over to the left side of the spine, behind the gullet, and beginning of the de- scending aorta, until it reaches the left carotid artery. It then ascends from the thorax, passing between the longus colli muscle and internal jugular vein, to the fifth cervical vertebra ; and then descends and terminates where the inter- nal, jugular, and subclavian veins are conjoined.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 306 toe; and from that arch, brandies are sent to the interossei muscles; also three large digital branches, each ofwhich, at the root of the toes, divides into two branches, supplying each side of the toes ; and these, at the points of the toes, are united. The perforating branch of the anterior tibial artery, joins the plantar arch, so as to form a free communication between the arteries of the upper and under side of the foot. SECTION V. OF THE VEINS OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The coats of the veins of the inferior extremities, are thick- er than those of the veins of the superior extremities; and, in some instauces, they attain so great a thickness, as to bear a very strong resemblance to those of an artery. The veins, especially the subcutaneous, of the inferior ex- tremities, are neither so large nor so numerous as those of the superior extremities ; and in the veins of the inferior as in those of the superior extremities, there are many pairs of valves. There are two sets of veins in the inferior extremities ; a subcutaneous and deeper-seated set, which communicate with each other freely and repeatedly. The superficial veins of the inferior extremities, which are situated under the skin, are united into two trunks, called Ve- N/E SAPH.ENME. The Vena Saphana Minor is formed by the veins of the outer side of the foot. This vein ascends on the outer side of the ancle; and on the back of the leg upon the gastrocnemius externus, and termi- nates in the popliteal vein. The Vena Saphcena Major, formed by the veins on the upper part of the foot, runs along the inner ancle and inner edge of the tibia, to the inner and upper part of the thigh, where it passes through the fascia lata of the thigh, and ter- nates in the deep femoral vein.

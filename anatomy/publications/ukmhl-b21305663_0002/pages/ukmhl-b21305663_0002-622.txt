ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 374 duals, and they vary m number; sometimes we meet with on- ly ten or twelve of them, but, on other occasions, with twenty, and even more. These glands may be divided into an upper and under class ; into those which lie nearest to the symphysis pubis, the lymphatic vessels of the external organs of generation enter, and these swell, or become buboes, in cases of cancer. Of the Iliac and Lumbar Lymphatic Glands. The lymph from the inguinal glands is conveyed by lym- phatic vessels, which enter the abdomen under the crural arch, and follow the course of the iliac arteries, and hence have been called Iliac Lymphatics, the number of which is various. The deeper seated lymphatic vessels which accompany the bloodvessels of the thigh, enter the pelvis through the small foramina in the membrane which plugs up the crural aperture. From the iliac glands, the lymph is conveyed into the lum- bar glands, which are placed upon the lumbar vertebrae, where the aorta divides into its two great branches, the iliacae communes. These glands vary much in different individuals. The lumbar glands receive lymphatic vessels from the bowels of the pelvis, and especially from the bladder of urine and vesiculae seminales, uterus and vagina. There are a few lymphatic vessels, which, after having passed beneath the crural arch, pass along the prone muscles, and ultimately terminate in the lumbar plexus of the lympha- tic vessels. Of the Lymphatic Vessels of the Organs of Generation. The lymphatic vessels of the testicle are large, and often numerous. The lymphatic vessels are often to be seen on the outer side of the tunica vaginalis : these take their rise from it. There are also many lymphatic vessels, which take their ori- gin from the deep parts of the testicle, which may be general- ly filled, by making a puncture into the body of that organ, and by inflating them.

OF THE UMBILICAL COItD. 607 through those vessels which form the connection between the mother and child. The protrusion of the membranes, distended by the liquor amnii, by gently dilating the os tineas, facilitates delivery. Of the Navel-String, or Umbilical Cord. The umbilical cord, the medium of connection between the placenta and child, is not uniform as to thickness and length. It is generally thinnest next the placenta, and about two feet long ; but, in some cases, does not exceed a foot, and in others is four or five feet in length ; and sometimes makes two or three turns round the childâ€™s neck. The umbilical cord consists of two arteries and a vein, and a thick jelly, all of which are enveloped by the chorion and amnion. The arteries and vein of the cord are disposed in a spiral direction. In some very rare instances, there is only one ar- tery. Sometimes the umbilical arteries are not disposed in the usual manner, but follow a straight course, and then form a sort of knot, one of the arteries being longer than the other. Owing to the thick jelly which envelopes the arteries and vein of the umbilical cord, and the spiral course of its arte- ries, pressure, or the stretching of the navel-string, does not readily interrupt the flow of blood through the bloodvessels. The umbilical cord is not fixed to the middle of the placen- ta ; hence the placenta is more readily detached. Of the Placenta, or After-Birth. The placenta is a flat organ ; to the touch spongy ; in form nearly circular; and about an inch in thickness in its centre, when its vessels are distended ; it is generally attached to the fundus uteri. The placenta towards its circumference becomes gradually thinner; and, when fixed to the uterus, is concave next the child, and convex towards the womb. The surface of the placenta, which is attached to the womb, is very tender, and lobulated. i* p VOL. II.

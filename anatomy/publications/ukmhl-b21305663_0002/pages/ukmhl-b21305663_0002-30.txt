4 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. produce larvae when confined in pure carbonic acid ; and when they were exposed to common air, the oxygen partly disap- peared, and carbonic acid was formed. Oxygen air is also necessary to vegetables. Seeds, for instance> do not germinate without a supply of oxygen. They do not vegetate in pure carbonic acid, though they swell when moistened, and soon putrefy. Hence the great advantage of exposing seeds to the air, and the cause of the greater fertility of sandy soils,â€”the atmosphere passing readily through the sand, but n'ot through the adhesive clay. In short, the admission of the air is necessary to vegetable as well as to animal life. Respiration, therefore, is one of those functions which has been justly called Vital; for to live and breathe are synony- mous terms. Another purpose served by the blood being exposed to the influence of the atmospherical air, is, the completion of the process of digestion. The chyle, before it become fit for nutrition, must be ex- posed to the influence of the air. The chyle and blood are not fully incorporated with each other, until they have passed through the lungs or gills ; hence, the organs in which this most essential change takes place, are appendages to the circulation. There is still another appendage to the circulating system, by which the due balance is preserved between the circulating fluid, and the caliber of the bloodvessels; or there is a medi- um through which that part of the fluid which is mixed with the blood, and is no longer useful, is discharged from the body. Such is the function of the kidneys and uriniferous canal. SECTION II. OF THE FAKIETES OF THE HUMAN THORAX. In the more perfect animals, the organs of circulation and respiration are contained within an osseous case, which serves not only as a means of defence, but also has, from its pecuiiai

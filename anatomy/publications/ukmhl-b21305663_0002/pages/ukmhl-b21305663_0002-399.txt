OF THE PI A MATER. $53 Of the Pia Mater. The third membrane of the brain has been called Pia Ma- ter. This membrane varies much as to its thickness and toughness, in different places. In some places it is not thick- er than a cobweb, but in others it is of a spongy consistence. This membrane is very largely supplied by bloodvessels* which pass from it into the substance of the brain. This membrane not only covers the upper and under sur- faces of the brain and its projections, but also enters in between its convolutions, forming processes of a spongy consistence, called Tomenta Cerebri; and these tomenta are fixed to the brain by bloodvessels, and fine cellular substance. Between the middle lobes, at the base of the brain, the arachnoid coat is detached from the pia mater, for the space of a quarter of an inch, under the posterior part of the corpus callosum and fornix. The most remarkable process or prolongation of the pia mater, is that which is situated under the fornix. There is a transverse slit in the back-part of the corpus callosum, at which the pia mater enters, to form the velum, or tela choroidea. The tela choroidea is a plexus of vessels, adhering firmly to the lower part of the fornix, which it imprints; it is somewhat triangular, being broader behind, and becoming gradually narrower. The pia mater covers and adheres to the thalami nervorum opticorum, and corpus fimbriatum. The pia mater also covers the corpora quadrigemina, and involves the pineal gland; adheres closely by many vessels to the under surfaces of the fornix, with which it corresponds in form. The velum separates under the anterior crura of the fornix, into two small portions, between which there is a passage to the third ventricle; and these two small portions of the velum are united with the anterior and smaller extremities of the choroid plexuses, below which the communication between the lateral ventricles is placed.

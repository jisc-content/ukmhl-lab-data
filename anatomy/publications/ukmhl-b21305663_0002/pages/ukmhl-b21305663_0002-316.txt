272 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. other of these remedies be not employed, the subcutaneous nerve in the vicinity of the vein that had been opened, is found much swollen, and of a purplish colour. The red lines in the skin over the course of the lympha- tic vessels of the arm, and the hard cords in that situa- tion, as well as a swelling at the elbow and in the arm-pit, prove, that the lymphatic system has been contaminated; but with me it is still matter of doubt, whether this be the primary seat of the evil. The irritability of the lymphatic vessels, and their disposition to inflame, by the application of a stimulus, applied to any part of the arm, is admitted. When the absorbent vessels are affected, after the inoculation of small-pox, or when there is a venereal or cancerous ulcer in the arm, they are said to be affected in a secondary manner. The thickening of the lymphatic vessels after bleeding, therefore, seems, not to be the primary affection; for it takes place when a patient has used his arm too soon and too freely after the vein has been opened, when it has been ir- ritated by rubbing on the clothes, when the orifice of the wounded vein has festered, and when the parts around had been inflamed and hardened. If the absorbent system be the part primarily affected, the axillary glands will, in the first place, be swollen ; whereas those lymphatic vessels in the immediate seat of the puncture or part of the vein that has been opened, are, in the first place, inflamed and indurated ; and that inflammation is pro- pagated to the axillary lymphatic glands. Collections of matter in different parts of the arm, are the frequent consequence of an injury, or of opening a vein ; hence, as inflammation of the cellular membrane often ends in that manner, it has been inferred, that an inflammation of the cellular membrane is the origin of the mischief. To me it seems probable, that an inflammation may be communicated to the cellular substance from the neigh- bouring parts. The dissections of that distinguished ana- tomist, the late Mr Wilson, and also those of Dr Clarke, prove, that inflammation is sometimes communicated to the veins in the vicinity of the womb after labour, and after the 3

85 OF THE AIR-TUBES. that vapours which irritate the larynx, excite a sense of suffo- cation, and a fit resembling the asthma. An ingenious physi- cian, Dr Carrick, who studied in this University, after ha- ving heard my Father mention the above opinion, put it to the test of experiment, by making an opening in the fore-part of the trachea of a living dog, and with a probe irritating the larynx and the bronchi. The irritation of the larynx produced instantly an asthma- tic ft. But the irritation of the bronchi did not afFect the breathing, because, as I suppose, their muscular fibres are feeble, and the cartilaginous segments which surround them prevent them from shutting the passage for the air. The diaphragm, the intercostal and abdominal muscles, act also irrregularly and spasmodically in the asthma, and in some cases I have observed the cardia contracted, and the stomach distended with air during the asthmatic fit. SECTION II. OF THE GLANDS CONNECTED WITH THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. There are Glands of three different descriptions which are connected with the Larynx and Trachea, viz. Mucous Glands, the Thyroid Gland, and Bronchial or Lymphatic Glands. Of the Mucous Glands connected zoith the Larynx. On the side of the epiglottis, next the larynx, the orifices of a number of glands are visible, through which a mucous liquor is discharged. There is a triangular space filled by cellular substance and small mucous glands between the ligaments, which connect the epiglottis to the notch of the thyroid cartilage, and to the under side of the os hyoides, and one which fixes the base of the os hyoides. This has been called the mucous gland of the epiglottis, and under the membrane of the arytenoid car-

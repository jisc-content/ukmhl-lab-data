OF THE HIGH OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. £11 but this is not apt to happen, if the instrument he passed obliquely downwards, or if the apparatus contrived for this purpose he employed *, or if an elastic gum catheter be left in the bladder, instead of the canula of the common tro- car. Some surgeons of eminence prefer the puncture from the rectum ; but the constant tenesmus the patient experiences, the embarrassment he suffers when he goes to stool, the diffi- culty of keeping the instrument in its place, and of re- placing it, the fatal consequences which sometimes result from the effusion of the urine, and the risk of wounding one of the vasa deferentia, lead me to prefer the former me- thod ; and, besides, a fistulous communication is sometimes the result of this mode of operating. Lastly, if the cause of the retention of urine be an enlarged prostate gland, the puncture from the rectum is inadmissible. Explanation of Plate VIII. This and the following plate were copied from the very careful dissections of my assistant Mr Mackenzie, who look great pains in displaying the singular and complex distri- bution of the muscular fibres of the back part of the blad- der. A points out the fundus of the bladder. B The lower part of the back part of the bladder. And C the back part of the body of the bladder. Fig. 2. Gives a representation of the ovarium, immediately after delivery. Fig. 3. Represents a section of an ovarium, five months af- ter delivery. • See an account of this apparatus in Mr Benjamen Bell’s System of Sur- gery, vol. v. p. .581, 6th Edition, Edinburgh 1796. It may be proper to add, that the very apparatus represented in Mr Bell’s Plate 61. was used for two years, by a celebrated philosopher, without the slightest inconvenience. ; The whole of his urine passed through that canula. Upon dissection, a stone wa3 found within the bladder, the prostate gland was enlarged, and nearly the whole of the urethra was obliterated. 0 £

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 186 case, the extremity of the vas deferens is considerably dilated. There is another variety in the structure of the vesicula? which sometimes occurs, viz. the vesicula? resemble pyriform bags. The vesicula? seminales are supplied with bloodvessels from the pudic arteries. Meckki., of Berlin has described particularly the absorbent vessels of the vesiculse. On opening the vcsiculsc, they present a sacculated appear- ance, which corresponds with the elevations on the surface. These sacculi are various in size, figure, and number, in different vesiculse; and, in these sacculi, a yellow coloured fluid, possessing a certain degree of viscidity, is contained. The inner surface is lined by a fine mucous membrane, which has been supposed to possess a follicular structure (which, however, I have not yet seen), from which a peculiar liquor is derived. Castration has a striking influence upon the size of all the organs of generation. The penis is proportionally much smaller ; the corpus spongiosum and corpora cavernosa penis do not admit of the same degree of distention as in the more perfect animal : the erectores penis and accelerators muscles are thinner, and paler in colour; and the prostate gland is also smaller . Of the Human Semen, and Contents of the Vesiculce Seminales. The human semen, when recent, is a viscid, glutinous, heavy fluid, which emits a very peculiar mawkish odour. The semen probably acquires its white colour from its admixture with the liquor of the prostate gland, as on pressing the ducts of the prostate gland after death, a quantity of white and opaque fluid exudes from these ducts. When semen is rubbed in a mortar, it becomes frothy. It renders paper stained with violets green, and hence it proba- bly contains an alkali. Semen, about twenty minutes after its emission, becomes quite liquid.

OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 861 fluid, which is secreted by the vessels distributed upon the membrane which lines them. The anterior and posterior cornua of the lateral ventricles, are placed nearly horizontally ; the middle cornua descend, and then run forwards into the middle lobes of the hemi- spheres. There is often a difference as to the size of the posterior cornua and the right and left ventricles. The ventricles dif- fer much in form in the class Mammalia. The Wenzels have remarked, â€œ Equidem superior eorum pars ad magnitu- dinem totius cerebri fere eandem habere proportionem vide- tur, quam superior lateralium ventriculorum pars in homine ad magnitudinem totius ejusdem cerebri habet, sed pars eo- rum posterior ac inferior ab ea, quae in homine constans est, structura admodum differt. Primo enim posteriora cornua plane desiderantur *. The corpus callosum is bent downwards at its posterior part, the continuation of which covers the corpora quadrige- mina; and, being continued forwards, forms what anatomists have called The Fornix, from its resemblance to a vault; and, when it has reached the anterior commissure of the brain, it seems to end in two crura or medullary cords. The under surface of the fornix is impressed by the arteries of the tela choroidea, which, from their supposed resemblance, in their distribution, to the strings of a lyre, are said to form the Lyre. Between the corpus callosum and fornix, the septum, called lucidum, is placed, which separates the anterior cornua of the lateral ventricles. The septum lucidum is narrow be- fore ; becomes gradually broader, or is in form triangular; and is composed of two plates of medullary substance. The plates of medullary substance which form the septum lucidum, may, by inflation, be separated from each other; and, in a few cases, a watery fluid insinuates itself between them.

210 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. taking care to pull somewhat downwards, as otherwise the exit of the stone may be impeded by the arch of the pubia and the triangular ligament of the urethra. Should the stone be broken within the bladder, the frag- ments may be got out by a scoop, and the smaller pieces will perhaps be forced out, if one or two pounds of tepid water be injected into the bladder, which injection has the further ef- fect of removing blood that may be lodged within the blad- der. Of the High Operation of Lithotomy. The bladder may be cut into above the ossa pubis, with- out opening the cavity of the abdomen, for, in the healthy state, a space equal to two or three inches intervenes between that part of the bladder, which is uncovered by the perito- naeum, and the ossa pubis ; and, in some cases, the bladder rises much higher above the symphysis pubis. Mr Smithâ€™s experience is certainly not in favour of the high operation. Mr Carpue has lately published a very full history of this method of cutting for the stone, and has recommended it as performed by Dr Souberbielle of Paris, who has had the merit of rendering it less dangerous ; but still, there are many objections to this operation, which are ably stated by that dis- tinguished lithotomist, Mr Martineau, in the eleventh vo- lume, p 402. of the Medico-Chir. Trans, of London, to which I refer the reader. Of Puncturing the Bladder. The bladder may be punctured above the ossa pubis, or from the intestinum rectum. The puncturing the bladder by a trocar above the ossa pu- bis is a very easy operation, when the bladder has risen freely above these bones. It has been objected to this operation, that, by the canula being left in the wound, the back part of the bladder is irritated by the point of it, and apt to fall into a state of ulceration

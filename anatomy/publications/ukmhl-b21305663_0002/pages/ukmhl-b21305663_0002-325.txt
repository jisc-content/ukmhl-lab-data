f f or THE MESENTERIC VEINS. 281 yet the flow of blood to the inferior extremities is not ob- structed. Sir A. Cooper was so polite as to send to me the body of a dog, whose aorta had been obstructed by a ligature, about an inch and a half above its division into the iliacfe com- munes. In that instance, the anastomosing branch between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries was much en- larged, and also the four superior lumbar arteries; and there were two large anastomoses between the second and third lum- bar arteries. Besides the branches that have been already named, the inferior mesenteric artery sends branches to the lower part of the colon. Of the Corresponding Veins. The veins correspond in their situation with the arteries above described, except the hepatic. The large trunks of the veins, viz. the Mesenteric, the Gas- tric, and the Splenic, unite in forming a large venous trunk, which lies under the head of the pancreas, and then enters the liver at its portae; and hence has been called the Vena Portarum. The vena portae receives the vena; cystica, and then divides into two great branches; one of which supplies the right lobe, and the other the left lobe of die liver. The blood carried to the liver by the hepatic artery and venae portae is returned to the heart by veins called Vena Cava Hepatica, which open into the vena cava by two, and often by three trunks, where the vena cava perforates the dia- phragm. In a former part of this work, I have described some un- common varieties as to the distribution of the vessels of the liver. There is a preparation in the Museum, in which there is a very unusual distribution of veins of the abdomen.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 326 There is a substance somewhat of a yellowish colour, and bearing some resemblance to very fine fat, or very fine mar- row, which is also found between the fibres of the nerves com- posing the ganglion. In very fat subjects this substance is more abundant than in the lean, and it is not limited to the human body: one of the best means for exhibiting it is to make a section of the gasserian ganglion of the horse. There arc a number of bloodvessels projier to the ganglia, which are derived from the neighbouring arteries, and which penetrate the pulpy substance and fibres that compose the ganglion. Many nervous cords may be traced on the surface of the ganglion, from their first attachment to the ganglion, till they have parted from it, without any substance intervening of a different texture from that of the nervous cords elsewhere. The nerves, in their course upon the surface of the gan- glion, divide into smaller nerves, and are again collected into larger cords, in such a manner that every nerve that comes out from the ganglion, consists of fibres from two or more of the nerves which enter the ganglion. The nerves within the ganglia retain their jointed appear- ance. The cords which come out from the under end of a gan- glion are generally larger than those which enter the upper er.d ; but there are exceptions to this rule in the course of the sympathetic nerve. Every nerve connected with a ganglion appears to contain cords, running in opposite directions; ascending, for instance, and descending; or where nerves are connected to the upper, under, or outer part, or side of a ganglion, (which is the case of the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic nerve), the nerve at the side appears to consist of cords, which divide into as- cending and descending cords, that are combined with the cords which compose the upper and under nerves *.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 420 cum, and have been named from their direction, or apparent action. The sixth muscle, the inferior oblique, takes its rise from the fore-part of the orbit. These muscles have been called straight and oblique mus- cles, but are not exactly so, on account of the shape of the orbit. The above muscles terminate in broad thin tendons, which are inserted into the sclerotic coat under the tunica adnata, about one-sixth of an inch from the cornea. By the straight muscles, the axis of the eye is directed to- wards different points ; and by their combined action, the eye-ball is directed towards any intermediate point, or in a circle by the successive action of these muscles. Rectus Superior, or Levator Oculi. This muscle passes, nearly horizontally, below the levator palpebrae superioris and optic nerve : it is the thinnest of the recti muscles ; takes its rise from the upper part of the fo- ramen opticum, and is fixed into the sclerotic coat, about one-fifth of an inch from the edge of the cornea. By this muscle the eye-ball is raised. Rectus Inferior, or Depressor Oculi. This muscle is situated in the lower part of the orbit; takes its rise from the lower part of the foramen opticum, and is fixed opposite to the insertion of the former muscle, into the sclerotic coat. By the above muscle, the fore-part of the eye-ball is de- Jbductor and Adductor Oculi. The eye-ball is provided with an abductor and adduc- tor muscle ; the former of which arises from the inferior and posterior part of the fissure of the orbit, and is fixed into the eye-ball opposite to its outer angle ; the latter, the shortest, thickest and straitest of the recti muscles, arises from the side of the foramen opticum, and is inserted opposite to the inner angle of the eye. i

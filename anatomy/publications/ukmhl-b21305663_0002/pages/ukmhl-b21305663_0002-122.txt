92 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. eVery where the colourless materials were strained into the interlobular cellular membrane. The straining of the colour- less materials shewed that the injected materials had been made very fluid and pushed with force; and, therefore, if there were natural and numerous passages for air from the proper cells of the lungs into the interlobular cellular mem- brane, they would have carried the very fine colouring powder along with them, as that will go as far as the air, especially considering the greater force with which it was pushed. Though I have denied that the proper cells communicate with the interlobular cellular substance, yet I admit that the air naturally, or in a living person, passes from one lobule into another; for I find that all the lobules are connected to those next to them at their roots. A great many lobules are besides this connected to the neighbouring lobules about their middle, and a very great number of lobules are connected to each other by their extremities. It is surprising that these connections, especially the last kind, which are very manifest, without dissection, on the sur- face of the lungs, should not have been more attended to by anatomists. In all these places, I find a number of cells of one lobule opening into those of the neighbouring lobule, without the intervention of the interlobular cellular membrane. To ascertain the manner in which the lobules communi- cated, I have filled a lobe of the lungs from the trachea with quicksilver or wax, and then, by dissection, divided it into lobules; or, after filling the lobe with wax, I have dipped it into the corrosive acid, so as to destroy all but the wax ; and have constantly found, that it is impossible to separate the lobules from each other, as deep as the branches of the bronchi or trachea which enter them, without cutting or tearing a great number of the proper cells of the lungs, which join the lobules to each other. Hence, air or quicksilver injected from a very small branch of the trachea into one of the lobules, in the most gentle and gradual manner, passes from that lobule into the neighbouring, and from these spreads so as to fill the whole lobe. These communications which cannot directly re- ceive a branch from the tracheu, furnish a further presump-

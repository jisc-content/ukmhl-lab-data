OF THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. 11 for the depression of the ribs, we certainly should not have found them continued to the sternum, because their anterior ends are fixed above to the edge of the sternum, or so near to the insertion of the cartilage of the upper rib in the sternum ; and their inferior ends are, in consequence of their obliquity, fixed to the under rib so much farther from the sternum, that they must act upon the under rib with more advantage of lever, or are intended for its elevation. i( On the other hand, if the internal intercostals had been intended for the depression of the ribs, we certainly should have found them continued backwards to the spine; because, from their obliquity, their under end would have been fixed to the vertebrae, or nearer to the head of the rib, and their upper end at such a distance from it, that this portion of the muscle would have been better calculated than any other por- tion of it for the depression of the rib. “ 6. In a few experiments which I made on living ani- mals, soon after I began to study anatomy; and which I re- peated afterwards, particularly in 1770, I saw plainly that both rows of intercostal muscles were in action during inspiration. <c Let us now consider the purpose, “ First, Of the obliquity of the fibres in the intercostal muscles; and, “ Secondly, Of their being disposed in two layers, the fibres of which decussate each other. “ It is evident, that the obliquity of the fibres here is not intended to increase their number, or the strength of the muscle, because the fibres would have been more numerous if they had passed directly from the one rib to the other, or had been inserted into the ribs at right angles. “ I apprehend, therefore, that we are to explain the rea- sons of the structure in the following manner: “ Nature, in order to give protection to the heart and lungs, has formed the ribs as broad and flat as possible, or left no more space between them than is required for lodging muscles for their motion in respiration. Consistently with this view, as the ribs are fixed at both ends, so that they cannot he moved backwards and forwards, but are confined to mo-

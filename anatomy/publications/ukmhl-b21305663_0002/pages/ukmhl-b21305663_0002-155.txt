OF THE STRUCTURE OF GLANDS. 121 larger ducts from it, which open into the urethra, at the sides of the caput gallinaginis. “ The semen within the testes is contained in ducts which seem to be cylindrical, and are not composed of smaller ducts joining together. “ The sebaceous matter intended for the defence of the sur- face of the skin from the air and friction, is, in some places, as in the nymphse or in the face, contained in roundish or long- shaped tubes, open at one end, or is poured out in the axillae, as I have found, by the ducts of small glands which adhere to the inner side of the skin, where the hairs grow ; and diffe- rent branches within the gland form the duct, or these glands resemble the tracheae within the cavities of the joints; and within the vesicae unguinosse (called by Aluinus Bursa Mu- cosa), no knots or glands are to be found, lodged in crannies of the joints, or protected by the pelotons of fat, such as have been, with much appearance of accuracy, described by au- thors. We can only observe masses of fat, covered by a vascular membrane, and fringes produced from that mem- brane ; and although it is highly probable that the fimbriae contain ducts which pour out synovia, yet such are not dis- tinguishable even with the aid of a microscope. “ After carefully examining all the preparations of the mam- mae, salivary glands, and pancreas, liver, and kidneys, whe- ther the injection was thrown into the arteries, or into the ex- cretory ducts, 1 have observed none but cylindrical vessels in the ducts of the mamma ; and also, that the globules in the course of the renal artery, were produced by convoluted cy- lindrical vessels. In the mamma, I found that there were not fewer than 400 little acini in the breadth of one inch; and, applying a microscope which magnifies greatly, I could plain- ly perceive that each of these acini consisted of several cylin- drical vessels in its breadth, and of course that the diameters of some of these did not exceed the 2AjD or part of an inch. A similar but less regular structure is observable in the pancreas and salivary glands, and also in the liver *.

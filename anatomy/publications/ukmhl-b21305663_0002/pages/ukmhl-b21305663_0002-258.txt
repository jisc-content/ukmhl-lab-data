ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 216 wanting; and I have seen it removed by a ligature without the loss of life. Ur Granville has published an account|in|the Phil. Trans., ol a case in which the ovarium and the Fallopian tube of one side were awanting. The uterus is retained in its situation by the broad ligament, which is formed by a duplication of the peritonaeum, and al- so by what have been called the round ligaments, which pass through the inguinal canals, and are lost in the groins. These round ligaments have a fibrous structure, and are composed of arteries, veins, nerves and lymphatic vessels, all of which are united by cellular substance, and are involved in the peritonaeum. In some women there are canals formed by the peritonae- um, which lie over the round ligaments, and into which the bowels sometimes descend. These canals were first described by Nuck, in his Adeno- graphia Curiosa, cap. 10., where he treats De Peritonaei Di- verticulis. Dr Camper found them open in 3 of 14 female children newly born; and Dr Wresberg, who has written a very learned dissertation on the subject, has observed, that he found these canals, which were large enough to admit a quill passing through the under abdominal aperture, to the groin or labi- um, in 19 out of 200 female children. The womb varies in size in virgins, and still more so in women who have had children ; and, after impregnation, it never returns to its original volume. Generally speaking, it is about 3 inches long, and about an inch and a half in breadth. In old age the w'omb becomes smaller and thinner in its pa- rietes. The womb, in figure, somewhat resembles a pear, flattened, and has been divided by anatomists into a fundus, or upper- most part, a body, a neck and mouth, or os tincae, the long diameter of which is placed transversely. Both its surfaces are somewhat convex, and more especial- Jy that next to the intestinum rectum. The fundus is the. broadest part pf the uterus; and the t 1

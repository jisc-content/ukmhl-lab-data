OF THE SACRxVL NERVE. 54t of the brachial anti popliteal aneurisms, and it has been em- ployed -without any bad consequence following, though it must have been made for some time., and to a considerable degree. ' ;T'- Scarpa, speaking of the effect of pressure in cases of popliteal aneurism, has remarked, that the compressing force must press down, and remove from the artery the con- centric coagulated layers of blood, which cannot take place, excepting in a very recent popliteal aneurism of a very small size, and it is necessary that the compression do not injure the sciatic nerve, especially its tibial branches ; but, as the nerve is situated immediately below the skin and aponeuroses of the ham this cannot be avoided. Notwithstanding the weight of such an objection to compression, it has been employed suc- cessfully, and, in a case of popliteal aneurism, very lately in the hospital of this city. It may also be observed, that a branch of the sciatic nerve, called the cutaneous posterior, takes its origin within the pelvis: it passes out along with the great sciatic, and divides into small branches, which are distributed on the skin of the arms and perineum, and on the skin of the upper and back part of the thigh. The popliteal nerve placed between the ham-strings, covers the popliteal vein of the ham, and is divided below the knee into an external and internal branch, or into a fibular and tibial nerve. The tibial and fibular nerves adhere for some little way to each other, and, by slight force, the sciatic nerve, in the middle of the thigh, may be separated into its two component nerves. The pain which attends the popliteal aneurism, probably originates from this nerve being much stretched by the sub- jacent tumours. The firular or peroneal nerve detaches the cutaneous nerve, which supplies the gastrocnemius muscle; a second branch, passes to the outer part of the leg, and termi- nates in the same side of the foot; a third branch, which per-

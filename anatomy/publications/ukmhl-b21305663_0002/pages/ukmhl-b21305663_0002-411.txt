365 OF THE BRAIN. From which, and from my observing that the most accurate authors have generally found it so likewise, I am inclined to suspect, that some have thought the water to be on the outer side of the brain, when in fact it was within it, partly from supposing it impossible that the very tender substance of the brain could be so enormously extended; and partly from their not knowing that the brain, when extended, becomes very thin *, perhaps more than most other organs, when distended by a like cause. Thus in the brain of the girl of eight or nine years of age, above mentioned, the ventricle was opened be- fore the knife entered above the depth of half an inch ; so that unless the scull-cap be very cautiously cut through, the water, by a slight cut or puncture, may be let out, and the dissector hence conclude that it was lodged on the outer side of the brain. â€œ I cannot help suspecting, that some like inattention, or concretion of the brain to the cranium, has led some to suppose, what can scarcely be conceived, that the brain is frequently and entirely changed into water; at least I think I may ven- ture to allege, that Morgagni, in his last work, and others, talk more of this than there seems reason to do. Hence, where water is supposed to be collected within the head, I have always thought, that we should by no means perforate with a trocar in the usual manner, passing this instrument deep, until the water runs along its sides ; but that, with cau- tious and repeated strokes of a knife and lancet, we should divide the common teguments and dura mater only; and if the water does not appear, desist. For, if the water be lodged within the ventricles of the brain, to give it a discharge, that organ must be wounded in its medullary, and highly sensible, as well as cortical part; besides, as the water runs off, the brain in collapsing will have its part deranged or tore so greatly, as probably to occasion instant or sudden death. Thus I have found, that the septum lucidum and fornix, were torn on let- ting out the water from the ventricles after death, or as the It is obvious from the above, that in cases of hydrocephalus the brain ir extended, an opinion which Drs Gall and SpuaznciM have al30 adopted.

OF THE OPTIC NERVE AND RETINA. 403 “ As the rays of light cannot be directly collected, so as to form a distinct picture on that part of the retina which lines the ciliary circle and ciliary processes, there is perhaps reason to suspect, that the light which is reflected from the picture formed at the bottom of the eye, does not assist vision, by giving a second stroke to that part of the retina on which the distinct picture is formed,—which seems to be the idea of authors; for such a second and posterior stroke would have nearly, or exactly, the same effect as the first; but rather, that we receive, on the anterior part of the retina, lining the ciliary circle and roots of the ciliary processes, a second and very different kind of impulse, by the light reflected from the bottom of the eye to this part, by which we see and judge better of the object. “ This supposition seems to be strongly supported, by the general observation, that the paint lining the choroid coat, at the bottom of the eye, which has been called Tapetum, is re- markably bright, and fit for the reflection of light, in those" animals which seek their food in the night-time, when such an aid is evidently most necessary.” On the sides of the optic nerves next the temple, and about two lines from the entrance of the optic nerve, there is a small aperture in the retina encircled by a yellow border. This aperture was only of late discovered by Scemmering, and probably because, if the eye be not very recept, it is often covered and concealed by a fold of the retina: no such folds exist in a very recent eye. This I ascertained in the eye of a person who was hanged, and which I examined within six hours after death. Some anatomists have denied the existence of this foramen, and have affirmed that the appearance of a foramen is pro- duced by a want of the medullary substance of that part of the retina. But if a very recent human eye be examined in the manner above described, I conceive there can be no doubt as to the existence of a foramen. I his aperture is best seen by looking; through the vitreous humour, after having removed the cornea, iris, and crystalline lens: thus the parts of the eye are not confounded. c c 2 I

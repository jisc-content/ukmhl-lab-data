ELEMENTS OF AN ATOM V. 3 68 of it would pass out at the perinaeum; hence the importance of depressing the handle of the instrument, so as to raise the point of it, in order that it may pass through the membranous part of the urethra into the bladder. On account, also, of the small size of the urethra, at that part of it which is behind the bulb, and the sudden turn it de- scribes, upwards at the same place, the point of the instrument may be arrested in its progress; to which the unyielding sides of the triangular ligament very much contribute; and I sfrongly suspect, that the unyielding edges of the triangular ligament have often been mistaken for a stricture of this part of the urethra, and the more especially, as the extremity of the bougie is indented, (which is supposed to be the most mark- ed symptom of stricture of the urethra), in consequence of having been pitched against the triangular ligament of the urethra. By introducing the finger into the anus, so as to elevate the point of the instrument, it may usually be passed into the neck of the bladder of urine, provided the penis shall be, at the same time, drawn forwards upon the catheter, which has the effect of stretching it. Stones are frequently impacted within the urethra; and they most frequently stick in the narrowest part of that canal. The irritation of the calculus creates inflammation, and still farther contraction, to which spasm essentially contributes; and when the calculus is fixed in its place by mere spasm from the muscular structure, it is relieved by anodynes, fo- mentation and bleeding. Where the urethra passes through the prostate gland, it lias merely a mucous membrane lining: it is fixed to the sub- stance of that gland, by a dense cellular substance. That part of the urethra which is beyond the prostate gland, has usually been called the Membranous portion of the ure- thra, because it has not the same degree of support as the other portions of the same canal. But it is not entirely membranous, as is implied by the name; for it is immediately surrounded by muscular fibres, which the late Mr Wilson of London has described, as pass-

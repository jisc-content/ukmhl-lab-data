OF THE PULMONARY ARTERY. 37 them, excepting at that place from which the pulmonary artery takes its rise. Of the Pulmonary Artery. This large artery takes its rise from the anterior ventricle, and its origin is marked by a white callous ring : it passes up- wards behind the breast-bone, and divides into two great branches, through which the blood flows into the right and left lungs. To prevent the stream of blood from flowing backwards in- to the ventricle, the internal coat of the artery is reflected, and forms three valves, somewhat of a semilunar figure, which are convex towards the ventricle, and concave towards the artery. Two of these are placed on the fore part of the artery, and the other on its posterior part; and each of these valves is directed upwards, so as to form a small sac, one edge of which adheres to about one-third of the circumfe- rence of the*inside of the artery; the other hangs loose, within the cavity of the artery. These valves yield before the stream of blood which flows from the ventricle; but when it is refluent, they are raised; and, with the aid of a small hard and red-coloured body, cal- led the Corpusculum Arantii, which is in the middle of the loose edge of the valve, completely obstruct the artery. The pulmonary artery opposite to the valves is somewhat enlarged, forming what anatomists have named Sinuses, of which there are three. The opposite sides of the heart are separated from each other by a septum, in which the muscular fibres of both ven- tricles are intermixed; and, upon this septum, there are a number of columnae carneae. Of the Posterior, or Systematic Heart. The blood which enters the lungs by the pulmonary ar- tery, flows by the medium of the four pulmonary veins into the posterior side of the heart. The posterior heart is very similar to the anterior in its structure.

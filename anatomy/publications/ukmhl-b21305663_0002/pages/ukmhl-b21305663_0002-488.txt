442 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. live chiefly upon the surface of the ocean: hence his ear is cal. culated to receive sound from the air by an external meatus. “ But in the amphibia, where a part only of the mass of blood passes through the lungs, and which, therefore, possess the power of breathing arbitrarily, or of plunging under wa- ter, and ceasing from breathing for a length of time, the ear is constructed so as to receive the first impression, either from the air or from the water; but, by means of an Eustachian tube, air is introduced into the cavity of the tympanum when they breathe, and through it the impression is conveyed from the atmosphere, to which their ears are generally exposed, to die bottom of the ear with more force than it would have been by the medium of a watery fluid secreted into the cavi- ty of the tympanum.’'’ In fishes living in and breathing in water, not only the impression of sound on the surface of the ear is transmitted by the water, but is of necessity conveyed by the same medium to the bottom of the ear : Hence, it is evident, they have no occasion for a cavity of the tympanum, nor for an Eusta- chian tube. At the bottom of the ear we find in all fishes semicircu- lar canals, similar in shape and situation to those found in the mammalia, not much larger, and more extensive in their sur- face ; in order, perhaps, to compensate for the less forcible impression made by the water in them than in us by the air. Connected with the semicircular canals, we find sacs con- taining cretaceous matter, which perhaps we may think have .as much resemblance to the cochlea as to the vestible in our ear, if we reflect that in birds the place of the cochlea is sup- plied by a short straight tube. The cretaceous matter, which in the Pisces of Linnaeus, and some of his Nantes Pinnati, forms hard and rugged stones, may serve, like the small hard bones of the ear, to convey a more forcible impression to the nerves, and spread out the membranes which contain them. With regard to the propagation of sound through air, Pro- fessor Leslie has remarked, “ No sensation is excited, unless the impression made upon our organs be repeated or con-

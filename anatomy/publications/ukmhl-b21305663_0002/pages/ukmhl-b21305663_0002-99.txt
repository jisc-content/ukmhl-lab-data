IOF ANEURISM. <69 The most frequent organic derangement of the vascular sys- tem is ossification. It occurs generally on the outer surface of the internal coat; and, in its incipient state, appears in the form of small points, or of thin bony shells. Such ossifications more frequently occur in the semilunar valves, at the beginning of the aorta, or in the mitral valve at the mouth of the auricle, and are frequently attended with a dilatation of the diseased artery, and with an enlargement, not only in the capacity of the left ventricle, but of the sub- stance and thickness of its muscular fibres. Table II. represents an aneurism of the arch of the aorta, in which that artery, after having been considerably expanded, gave way nearer to its origin, and a considerable quantity of blood was effused into the pericardium. A, The aorta near to its rise from the left ventricle of the heart. B, The aorta very considerably enlarged. C, Points out the seat of the rupture of the aorta. D, The arteria innominata. E, The left ca- rotid artery. F, The left subclavian artery. The aorta at the place on which the letter H is placed, is of its natural size. Table III. represents an aneurism in the arch of the aorta, in which a portion of that artery is considerably enlarged : there was a small sac at the root of the left subclavian artery formed by the expansion of the outer coat of the artery, which gave way, and occasioned the instant death of the patient. Be- tween the letters A and A, the aorta was enlarged. B, Is placed upon'the arteria innominata. C, Points out the left carotid artery ; and D the left subclavian artery. E, Points out the thoracic aorta, which is of its natural size. F, Points out the sac, which is formed by the external coat of the ar- tery, and which burst suddenly, when the patient was at the water-closet. ' -

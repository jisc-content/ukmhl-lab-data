309 ANASTOMOSES OF VEINS. cess of time, a few only of the collateral arteries are perma- nently enlarged; the others collapse in different degrees, when no longer necessary to the continuance of the circulation. Another beautiful provision for the same purpose, was dis- covered by Dr Parry. After a ligature had been thrown around each of the carotid arteries of a ram on the 17th of September 1815, the animal was killed on the 17th of the following October. When the bloodvessels were injected, “ the old portion of the artery was found obliterated, its place being supplied by five new ramifications, uniting in different points the extremity of the inferior portion of the old artery with the superior portion.'” But the very striking union between the arteries and veins on the face of a stump, has not, as far as I know, been yet explained. I have therefore inserted the engraving Plate XI., from a preparation made by my Father, which shews distinctly the above circumstances. The vessels upon which there are transverse lines, are the arteries ; the corresponding veins are given in outline, and a number of dots are put up- on the nerves. In PLATE XI. A represents the Arteries. BBB the Veins. C the Nerves.

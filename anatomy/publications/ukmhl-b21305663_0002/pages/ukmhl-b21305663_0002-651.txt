OF THE FCETUS. 617 11 th, The eleventh is by far the most frequent cause of the death of the foetus, viz. long and tedious labour after the dis- charge of the liquor amnii, and when the head of the child has been long retained in the os tineas or pelvis. The child when born is observed to be insensible, a purple-coloured tumour may be observed on the vertex or occiput; the head is very much extended ; the bones of the skull are depressed, and sometimes even fractured ; and the eyes and face are of a livid hue. 1 Sth, When delivery is sudden, and the contents of the womb are discharged at once, or en bloc, as the French call it. 13th, When the child, at the instant of birth, falls, head foremost, upon a hard substance it may be killed; this hap- pens when the mother is in an erect position. 14>th, The omitting to put a ligature upon the umbilical cord has been stated to be a cause of death of the foetus. According to Carpuron, this mode of death is not to be ad- mitted ; he observes, â€œ If we meet with a body of a new- born child pale, bloodless, of the colour of wax, and without a ligature on the cord, we should regard the haemorrhage, which occasioned its death, after coming into the world, as an effect, not of omitting this ligature, but of the obstacles that hinder- ed or suppressed the respiration and pulmonary circulation.11 FINIS.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 452 same size in the human body; they are not found in the foe- tus. These cells are composed of very hard bone, and are well calculated for increasing the intensity of sound. In the ape, whale, horse, tiger, dog and sheep *, there are cavities which communicate with the cavity of the tympa- num ; these, by reflecting sound, add to its intensity. A chain of bones extends across the cavity of the tympa- num, the outer extremity of which is fixed to the centre of the membrane of the drum, and the inner extremity is fixed to the membrane of the oval hole. This chain in the human body, is composed of four distinct bones, called the Malleus, the Incus, the Os orbiculare and Stapes, which are firmly united by membranes and ligaments. There are three muscles appropriated to the putting these bones on the stretch to a greater or less degree. The Malleus or Hammer consists of a round head, a small neck and handle, and two little processes. The head of the bone is turned upwards and inwards, and forms an angle with the neck of the bone, and the handle is laid along the membrana tympani, to the centre of which it adheres. The Incus or Anvil consists of a body, and two crura, of equal length. It is articulated with the malleus by a capsu- lar ligament, and the surfaces of the bones are covered by cartilage, forming a ginglymous joint; and it is fixed by a ligament on which it moves backwards and forwards, to the side of the mastoid cells. The Os orbiculare is articulated with the long process of the incus. The Stapes, so named from being like a stirrup, is placed horizontally, and is divided into a head, crura, and base. The base of the bone is of an oval shape, and its edges cor- respond with those of the fenestra ovalis. The longest crus of the stapes is placed backwards. There are three muscles by which this chain of bones is moved. â€¢ Monro on the Ear, Tab. 2. and 5.

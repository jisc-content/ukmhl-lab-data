OF THE LACRYMAL DUCTS. 435 and consists of numerous lobules, between which the vessels proper to it are lodged. This gland is situated above the junction of the upper and under eye-lids, at the outer and upper part of the orbit, and behind the outer end of the su- perciliary ridge, by which it is covered and well protected. A small ligament has been described by Simmering which passes from the external and posterior part of the lacrymal fossa under the gland; by which this gland is retained in its place. The lacrymal gland is supplied by the ophthalmic artery. The nerves of this gland are derived from the ophthalmic nerve. There is also a cluster of smaller lacrymal glands si- tuated between the larger lacrymal gland and the upper eye- lid. In some animals, as the turtle, the lacrymal gland is of very considerable size, nearly two inches long, and an inch broad; and, in substance, it bears an analogy to that of the pancreas *. The ducts of the lacrymal glands are not easily seen in the 'human body: they are placed in the direction of the smaller lacrymal glands. My Father discovered and described these ducts in the 1758. The lacrymal ducts in the human body are small; they :pass out from the interior part of the gland, and do not com- municate with each other. There are usually only live or six ducts to be seen, which Terminate on the inner side of the upper eye-lid, near to the outer angle of the eye *f*. The ducts of the lacrymal gland are large in the inferior animals. In the turtle, each of the acini of the gland sends out a duct, which, by their union, form a duct capable of re- ceiving a surgeon’s probe. The tears are spread over the * Mr Todd, in the Dublin Hospital Reports, vol. iii., has published some mportant observations on the diseases of this gland.

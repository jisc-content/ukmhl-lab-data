500 ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. ing the sympathetic nerve. But this did not seem to be the case in any of the experiments which I performed. JExper. 4. August 29. About one-half inch of the sym- pathetic nerve of the left side of a fourth rabbit was cut out, and on the right side a similar portion of the sympathetic nerve, and about an inch of the phrenic nerve. As soon as the wound was sewed up, the animal ran about very vigorously, and did not betray a single symptom of having been injured in any way. A case, in which a tumour, surrounding the windpipe, was cut out by Klein of Germany, shews clearly the ef- fect of dividing the eighth pair of nerves. In consequence of the operation the patient remained speechless for three weeks, and his voice became C{ a deep well-toned bass.‚Äù Of the Recurrent Nerve. The eighth pair sends off a nerve which is reflected back- wards, and has been hence called The Recurrent; it bends around the right subclavian artery, and on the left side around the aorta. This nerve ascends, and adheres to the posterior and late- ral parts of the windpipe, in its progress to the larynx, and behind the thyroid gland; it sends off very minute nerves, which penetrate the windpipe, and are distributed upon its in- ternal membrane; and also some small nerves, which are spent upon the thyroid gland. On the inner side of the thyroid cartilage, a branch is sent off from the recurrent nerve, which communicates with the internal laryngeal nerve ; and from this branch of the recur- rent, very minute branches penetrate deep, and are spent up- on the internal mucous membrane of the larynx. The recurrent nerve, as has been very faithfully represented by Scarpa in his Table III. of the nerves of the head, neck, and thorax, is connected with the sympathetic nerve, with which it forms an intricate plexus of nerves, from which nerves descend, and arc distributed upon the bronchi and pulmonary artery.

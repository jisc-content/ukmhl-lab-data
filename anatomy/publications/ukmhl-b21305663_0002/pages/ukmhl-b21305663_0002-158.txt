124 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. remarkable circumstance cannot be explained on the principle of the mere transudation of a liquor. “ By disease, the quantity and qualities of the different se- creted fluids are much altered. On some occasions, for in- stance, the secretion by the skin is very much diminished or suspended ; but, on other occasions, it is increased. And, on the other hand, by the disease called Diabetes, the quanti- ty of the urine secreted in 24 hours is sometimes so great as to be equal to 20 lb. or 80 lb., though the patient did not drink more than when he enjoyed good health. “ Sd, The last argument against the idea of the mere transu- dation of fluids is derived from the effects of irritation applied to glands. Thus a blow on the female breast occasions the swelling and hardening of the part injured, the vessels of which take on a new action, and secrete the cancerous matter. “ The effects of the venereal or variolous poison upon the vessels of the part to which they are applied, demonstrate the same fact; thus their natural action is so much altered, that they generate the venereal and variolous poisons.” Table VI.

22 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the heart to the pericardium, its pulsations are felt with diffi- culty in any position, its motion being much confined. 'I he pericardium receives its blood from the smaller branch- es of the internal mammary, phrenic, and ccsophagean arteries, and these are accompanied by corresponding veins. Veins have not as yet been traced into the substance of the pericardium. There are also absorbent vessels proper to the pericardium. Dr Baillie has described an instance in which the peri- cardium was a wan ting. o SECTION VII. OF THE BLOOD. Before proceeding to describe the heart, it is necessary to make a few remarks upon the blood. The human blood is an adhesive fluid, of a red colour m the animals that have vertebra?; has a soapy feel, a salt taste, and emits a watery halitus; its specific gravity is about 1.0527, according to Haller. In crustaceous animals, as the lobster and shrimp, the blood is white, and in the grasshopper, of a green hue. Where blood recently drawn, and mixed with water, is ex- posed to a microscope, it is found to be composed of a watery part, and of particles deeply coloured, called the Globules, for the colour is not equally diffused. The globules, according to Mr Hewson, are involved in capsules or vesicles. The form of these globules is not uniform in all animals ; in somo they are oval, in others rounded. The globules vary also as to size, according to different ob- servers, even in blood drawn from the same animal, and still more in different animals, and are not proportioned to the size of the animal, being larger in man than in an ox. According to the recent observations of Captain Eater and Mr Bauer, they vary between T?L5 and 75'o o part of an inch in diameter. When blood has been allowed to remain at rest, it soon coagulates into a solid mass, of the consistence of curd ; which separates itself into two parts, the serum and the cruor. The

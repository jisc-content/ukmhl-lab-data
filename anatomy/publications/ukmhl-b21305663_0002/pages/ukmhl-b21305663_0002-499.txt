453 OF THE STAPEDIUS. The Laxator Tympani. This muscle arises, by a small beginning, from the extremi- ty of the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, behind the en- try of the artery of the dura mater ; after which it runs back- wards, and a little upwards, along with the nerve called chor- da tympani, in a fissure of the os temporis, near the fossa that lodges the condyle of the lower jaw. This muscle is fixed into the long process of the malleus, within the tympanum, where it rests upon the edge of the fis- sure, between the pars squamosa and petrosa. This muscle tends to draw the malleus obliquely forwards towards its origin ; consequently, the membrana tympani is made less concave, or is relaxed. Tensor Tympani. This muscle arises, by a very small beginning, from the cartilaginous extremity of the eustachian tube, just where it begins to be covered by the pars petrosa and spinous pro- cess of the sphenoid bone, near the entry of the artery of the dura mater: from thence running backwards near the osse- ous part of the eustachian tube, it forms a very distinct fleshy belly, below a thin osseous plate, between the pars squa- mosa and labyrinth; and sends off a slender tendon, which makes a turn into the tympanum, along with the nerve called chorda tympani. This muscle is fixed into the posterior part of the handle of the malleus, a little lower than the root of its long process. By this muscle, the malleus and membrana tympani are pulled inwards towards the pars petrosa, by which the mem- brane of the drum is made more concave and tense. Stapedius. This muscle arises by a small fleshy belly, from a little ca- vern in the pars petrosa, near the cells of the mastoid process, before the inferior part of the passage for the portio dura ; its tendon passes through a small round hole in the side of the I

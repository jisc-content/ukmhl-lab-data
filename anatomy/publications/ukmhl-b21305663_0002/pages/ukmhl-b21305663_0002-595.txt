OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 547 CHAPTER T. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE LYMPHATIC OR ABSORBENT SYSTEM. An intimate acquaintance with the origin, course, anasto- moses and terminations of the Lymphatic Vessels, cannot but prove of the utmost importance in the study of the animal economy, as these have a great share in several of the ope- rations of the living system. It is also of great moment, in a practical view, because, through the lymphatic vessels, many poisons enter the system, and are propagated through the body; and by the agency of this system, diseases are some- times removed. Before proceeding further it seems necessary to describe the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic vessels take their rise from every part of the body. They are small pellucid tubes; and being gene- rally filled by a thin watery fluid, have been called, on that account, Watery Ducts, or Lymphatics; and more lately, Ab- sorbent Vessels, on account of their peculiar function. It would lead me into a very long digression, foreign to the business of an elementary book, to give a minute account of the discovery of these vessels. It may not be improper, however, to state, that the older anatomists were probably ignorant of the existence of such vessels, and certainly so as to their origin and mode of distri- bution, which may readily be conceived from the small size and pellucidity of these tubes; and from the art of making anatomical injections being unknown, they had no means of Mm2

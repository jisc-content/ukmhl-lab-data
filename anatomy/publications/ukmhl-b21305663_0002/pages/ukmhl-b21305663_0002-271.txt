ON GENERATION. 229 SECTION XII. ON GENERATION. As animals are destined to live but for a certain period, it is necessary that they should possess the power of procrea- tion. The period at which animals are capable of procreation is very various, depending upon the species, climate, food, &c. Generally speaking, those of warmer climates sooner arrive at the period of puberty than those of the more temperate cli mates. But little -is known respecting the function of generation. In the vegetable as well as in the animal kingdom, the young is attached, by some means, to the parent; and the separation of the one from the other is the birth ; or generation consists in the appearance of an organized foetus in or upon some part of a larger animal, from which it is separated, at a certain period, to take on an independent existence. Individuals amongst neat cattle, in which the male and fe- male organs are to a certain degree combined, have been called Free Martins; and it is worthy of remark, that in these, ac- cording to Mr Hunter, the ovaria and testes are imperfect. Human hermaphrodites have been described by Haller, Petit, and others. The clitoris has been so much elongated, as to resemble the penis of the male : sometimes it has been an inch or more long, and thick in proportion; and, on the other hand, mal- conformation of the external organs of the male may lead to the suspicion of the person being a hermaphrodite. I had occasion to be consulted, along with Mr Bryce and Dr Clarkson, by a lad, who, at first sight, might have passed for a hermaphrodite; there was no part of the penis, but the glans, and it passed between two bodies, very similar in size, situation and form, to the labia externa, and inter- nally they were of a red colour, and had a villous surface.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 606 vering to the placenta and umbilical cord, and adheres pretty firmly to it. The third membrane lines the uterus, and falls off at every delivery; and has hence been called Decidua. It is very easily torn, though thicker than the amnion or chorion ; and there are a number of small vessels proper to it, which contain red blood. Of the Liquor Amnii. The fluid contained within the amnion, has been called Li- quor Amnii. This fluid, which varies in quantity in different women, has no sensible degree of tenacity; is nearly transparent; has a slight yellow tint; and sometimes reddish, from an admixture of a few drops of blood; is to the taste salt, and is composed of Water, about - - 98.8 Albumen, muriate of soda, soda, phosphate of lime, lime, - - - 1.2 100.0 In some cases, there is a small quantity of water between the chorion and amnion, which is commonly discharged be- fore the birth of the child. This fluid renders the pressure on the body of the foetus more equal, and prevents the womb from pressing on any part of the foetus. Hence when an officious midwife draws off the waters too soon, the child is sometimes killed, by the contrac- tion of the womb stopping the circulation of the blood in the umbilical cord. By means of the liquor amnii, the uterus is equally ex- tended in all its dimensions, and hence the growth of the body of the child is not interrupted. The liquor amnii renders the foetus lighter. If the speci- fic weight of the foetus be to the liquor amnii as 20 to 19, the foetus makes a pressure on the uterus equal only to the jâ€™jjth part of its absolute weight ; therefore there is less chance of the foetus interrupting, by its weight, the flow of blood

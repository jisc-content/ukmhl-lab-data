MUSCULAR POWER OF THE BLOODVESSELS. 65 Dr Jones’s experiments have thrown much light on this subject. They have proved, that bleeding is stopt by the mus- cular contraction of the vessels, by the retraction of the artery within its sheath, by the effusion of blood into the cellular membrane, by which the artery is connected with the neigh- bouring parts, which coagulates and presses on the orifice of the artery, and by the formation of a small conical coagulum within the artery, which adheres by its circumference to the cut or divided surface of the wounded vessel. The vasa vasorum of the artery also pour out coagulable lymph, and thus the space is filled up between the external coagulum, and that within the artei’y; and, lastly, coagulable lymph is effused between the coats of the divided artery. The arteries in the vicinity of abscesses in the lungs* and liver, are also occasionally filled by coagulable lymph, by which the bleeding, which otherwise must have occurred, is prevented. C. From gangrene of the feet succeeding to ossification of the coats of the femoral artery. D. From the circulation being continued when the heart is wanting, as in some foetuses, and in many worms. 9- When the heart contracts, the arteries are at that in- stant dilated ; and in this state we perceive their pulsatory motion. That the pulse is owing to the dilatation of the coats of the artery, may be made obvious (Bichat states) by trans- fusing the blood from an artery of a living animal into the humeral artery of a dead body, which thereby acquires pul- sation. 1 hat the pulse is not owing to the contraction of the coats of the artery, has been fully proved by Vf.salius’s experi- ments +. 10. If the laws of hydraulics are applicable to the arterial system, the blood, in consequence of its viscidity, of friction, • Vide STiRic’a Works, edited by Dr C. Smyth. t Vide Vg,AL. de Corp. Human.

EXPERIMENTS ON SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 499 The animal did not scream aloud. The wound made was accurately sewed up. After the operation, the animal ran about. July 8. Now a good deal of dung in the place where the animal was kept. The rabbit has eaten a good deal, and seems in health. July 13. The animal seems in all respects healthy. Etvper. 3. July 10. The same experiment was made on a third rabbit as on the preceding, and the result was quite similar this day. N.B.—The cellular substance was dis- sected from the par vagum. July 11. The animal seems in perfect health, has eaten a good deal of clover and cabbage leaves, and has passed a good deal of dung. July 14. The animal seems in all respects well. The wound has healed by the first intention. August 30. This rabbit had young four weeks ago, Mr Petit informs us in the History of the Acad, des Sci- ences for 1727, that he made many experiments on living dogs. He cut the intercostal nerve opposite to the third or fourth vertebra of the neck. He adds, that as the intercostal nerve is in the same sheath with the eighth pair, the one nerve cannot be cut without the other. The result of dividing the eighth and sympathetic nerves, was an afFection of the eyes, the animal’s difficult breathing, and palpitation. But it has been proved by many experiments, that the symptoms above enumerated are owing solely to the division of the eighth pair, for they are not occasioned when the sym- pathetic nerve only is divided. It is difficult to explain why the muscles of the eye should be so much affected by the di- vision of the eighth pair, as the nerves of the muscles which move the eye-ball are not connected with the nerves distri- buted on the muscles of the orbit. Dr Postal of Paris, in the fourth volume of his Anat. Med., informs us, that the eyes are much affected by divid- i i 2

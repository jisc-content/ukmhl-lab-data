G alen has made mention of histo- ries of this kind, and calls the glands, when sound, ulzvoi; when swelled, bubones. , There are other examples of a similar nature, and which afford strong arguments in favour of absorption by the lym- phatic vessels. When a strong smelling pungent substance, as camphor, is applied to any part of an animal, it communi- cates its peculiar smell and taste to the lymph, within the tho- racic duct; and even in the present day, when the tide of opinion is so strong in favour of absorption by the veins which convey red blood, the experiments of Drs Lawrence and Coats, which have been recently made *, have demon- strated, that a solution of the sulphat of iron, thrown into the abdomen of a cat, was not found in the blood, or other fluids, until it had made its appearance at the upper part of the tho- racic duct.

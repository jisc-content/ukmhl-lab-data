ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY'. 346 brain, when triturated with potash, gave out ammonia; and ammonia was likewise obtained, when a mixture of brain, po- tash and water, was distilled. When water is boiled with a quantity of brain, then fil- tered, and mixed with alkohol, only a little gelatinous matter separates. The alkoholic solution, in a few weeks, deposited crystals, which consisted of a greasy matter, phosphate of ammonia, and common salt. Alkohol separates the fatty matter very well from brain, and the liquid passes readily through the filter when hot. The fatty matter of calf’s brains is white ; at the same time, the alkohol dissolves another substance, called by Thenarii and Vauquelin Qzmazone. The constituents of the cortical portion of the brain of the calf, were as follows : Water, - - 75 to 80 Insoluble, cerebral, albumen, with some so- luble, ditto, Ozmazone, Fatty matter. Phosphate of Lime,. Phosphate of Soda, Phosphate of Ammonia, Phosphate of Magnesia, A Sulphate, Common Salt, Trace of Phosphate of Iron, 100. The medullary portion of brain contains the same consti- tuents as the cortical; but the proportion of fatty matter is •greater, and the celebral albumen, when treated with alkohol, is harder and more fibrous. Traces of silica are also found in it. The medulla oblongata contains the same ingredients as the medullary portion of the brain, but less water and more albumen. The same observations apply to the thalamus nervorum op- triorum, the cerebellum, and the nerves.

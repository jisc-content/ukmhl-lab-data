OF THE BRONCHIAL GLANDS. 87 Of the use of the Thyroid Gland. A great many opinions have been entertained respecting the use of this gland, which the reader will find enumerated in the works of Haller and Soemmering. It must be acknowledged that we are still much in the dark as to the use of this gland. Of the Bronchial Glands. With the lymphatic absorbent system I shall treat of the large blue or black coloured glands at the division of the trachea, named by anatomists Bronchial, since I think the following circumstances prove these are subservient to the lym- phatics. In the first place, on squeezing these glands, after laying open the trachea, I do not not perceive that the smallest drop of the black matter enters the trachea. I cannot observe the smallest vestige of an excretory duct, on separating these glands from the trachea. On tracing the lymphatic vessels of the lungs, I have found them terminate in these glands, and dispersed through them ; and opening into their cells on one side, and coming out from their cells on the opposite side, in the very way the lympha- tics enter, pass through, and come out of, the conglobate glands, in other parts of the body. Now, it is very improba- ble that these glands alone should so perform a double office of secreting one liquor, and transmitting another. But if we, for these reasons, deny that the bronchial glands pour a liquor into the trachea, how are we to account for our coughing up a dark coloured matter, like that contained in those glands ? That, I apprehend, will admit of explanation on another supposition, viz. that the black matter is secreted by the ves- sels distributed through the substance of the lungs; I do not mean, by the small glands of the trachea before described, for these are always of a brown or ashy colour, and contain a pel- lucid mucus, but by vessels without a glandular appearance. To confirm this notion, let us reflect, that, in adult persons.

OF THE GRAVID WOMB. 60S CHAP. I. OF THE STATE OF THE UTERUS AT THE NINTH MONTH OF PREGNANCY. The Contents of the Pregnant Womb are, the foetus, li- quor amnii, placenta, membranes, and umbilical cord. The placenta and membranes line the womb, and contain the foetus, and the liquor amnii. Of the State of the Uterine Tubes at the Ninth Month. The uterine tubes do not pass horizontally outwards, as in the virgin state, but are closely applied to the uterus; are al- so larger, redder, less convoluted; exhibit more distinctly a muscular structure; and the internal rugae are more distinct. Of the State of the Ligaments of the Womb at the Ninth Month. In consequence of the extension of the womb, the broad li- gaments in a great measure disappear; for little more than the roots remain. The round ligaments are much enlarged; their arteries be- come tortuous, and anastomose with the external vessels of the groin. The round ligaments pass downwards on the fore-part of the body of the uterus, and are considerably larger, and more vascular, than in the virgin state; and the bloodvessels pro- per to these anastomose with the external vessels of the groin.

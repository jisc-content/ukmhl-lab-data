OF THE EYE-IJDS. 427 ball and eye-lids, and connects the eye with the respiratory system. « The fifth is the universal nerve of sensation to the head and face, to the skin, to the surfaces of the eye, the cavities of the nose, the mouth, and tongue. “ The sixth nerve is a muscular and voluntary nerve of the eye.” OF THE APPENDAGES TO THE EYE. Of the Eye-Lids. The Eye-lids are moveable curtains, which cover part of the fore-part of the eye-ball, protect it from external in- jury, and from too vivid light, and keep the surface of the eye-ball always moist. The eye-lids are connected with the orbits by condensed cellular substance. The eye-lids are convex outwardly; concave inwardly when they are applied to the eye-balls ; and the upper eye- lid is the larger and more moveable, and covers the greater part of the eye. The skin lines the eye-lids : at the edges of these it becomes much thinner, and is continued after lining the back-parts of the eye-lids, upon the cornea, and a portion of the sclerotic coat forming the tunica adnata at the internal angle of the eye; the tunica adnata forms a fold somewhat like the third eye-lid of birds. The tunica adnata has been described as a mucous mem- brane, but it has not the villous surface of the other mucous membranes, and, as a proof that the cuticle covers the cornea, hairs sometimes grow from it, as I have seen in the human body, and also in the ox; and in the class Amphibia, that change their cuticle at certain seasons, the tunica adnata comes off with the rest of the cuticle. When the eye-lids are opened, there is always a wrinkle in the skin in each eye-lid, which is most obvious in the upper,

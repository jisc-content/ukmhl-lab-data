378 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The Wenzels have also published the case of a man of sixty-seven years of age, whose right and left leg, and left i side of the face, were paralytic before death. They state, that, on dissection, the vessels of the dura mater and of the left hemisphere, were turgid with blood, and discoloured, in conse- .1 quence of extravasation of blood below it, which covered the whole hemisphere ; so that instead of being convex, it was concave on its upper surface. The left corpus striatum and thalamus nervi optici, were paler, and less than the right. The above cases, detailed by gentlemen possessing an inti- mate knowledge of the structure of the brain, demonstrate the difficulty of arriving at an accurate knowledge of the functions of particular parts of that organ. From the above instances, and from others to be found in Wenzels1 book, it may be inferred, that palsy generally occurs on the opposite side of the body ; and as the power of speech was much affected in some of the instances in which the corpus stiiatum was dis- I eased, some persons might thereby infer that the nerves of the tongue arc somehow connected with the corpora striata. Of the Nodus Cerebri, Tuber Annulare or Pons Varolii, The pons Varolii, which is, as it were, the centre between the brain and cerebellum, can only be well seen by inverting the brain. Its breadth considerably exceeds its length ; it is externally of a white colour, beneath which there is a cine- ritious substance, and is formed by the union of four columns, the crura cerebri and cerebelli, which form a sort of crescent or bridge; the fore-part of which is arched, and the back- part, next the medulla oblongata, is concave. On the surface of this substance, there are a number of furrows disposed transversely, about a line distant fi'om each other, which run in a direction parallel to the anterior and posterior edges of this substance, and to each other; and these furrows are crossed by a deep depression, which lodges the basilar artery, formed by the conjoined vertebral ar-, t cries.

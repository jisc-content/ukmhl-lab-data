The superficial lymphatic vessels of the liver follow an ar- borescent course, and are more easily filled than the lympha- tic vessels of any other part of the body. These superficial lymphatic vessels pass upwards towards the falciform ligament of the liver; they pass along this liga- ment and perforate the diaphragm directly, and then pass in- to small glands, placed upon the anterior part of the pericar- dium. Some of the lymphatic vessels from the convex part of the liver, pass towards the lateral ligaments of the liver, and form two or three branches of considerable size, which perforate the lateral portions of the diaphragm, and afterwards run on that part of it which is next to the thorax following the course of the ribs ; and some branches from them terminate in glands placed upon the gullet. The lymphatic vessels from the lateral ligaments having join- ed with those from the falciform ligament, form a large plexus, which ascends between the layers of the anterior mediasti- num, along with the internal mammary artery, and terminates in the upper-part of the thoracic duct. The lymphatic vessels of the concave part of the liver are united to the deeper-seated lymphatic vessels of the liver, and they accompany the biliary ducts and bloodvessels of the liver, and pass through several lymphatic glands situated within the Capsule of Glisson, and terminate in the thora- cic duct near to its middle *. The lymphatic vessels of the spleen are very small in the human body, but in the inferior animals they are large and numerous. There are two sets of lymphatic vessels proper to the spleen, a superficial and deeper-seated set; the latter accom- pany the arteries of that organ, join with those of the pan- Beclard supposes that absorbent vessels take their rise from the excre-

96 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. vast quantity of fixed air is evacuated, we will be apt to sup- pose that by this channel, air is extricated from the blood. I have very frequently seen air within the vessels of the pia mater, and also on some occasions within the internal ju- gular veins. According to Ur Davy, “ air seems to pass pretty readily (probably through the exhalants) from the air- cells of the lungs into the pleura.” He inflated the lungs cf a dog under water, by means of a double bellows, through the trachea,—and “ air in exceedingly minute bubbles escaped from the surface of the pleura, covering one of the inferior lobes, of a large size I have always found communications between the bronchial artery and pulmonary vein-f-, and hence it is vain with Van Swieten to suppose we may distinguish an inflammation of the pulmonary from that of the bronchial vessels, by external symp- toms. Notwithstanding that the whole mass of blood passes through the lungs, and that as much of the mass is circulated through the lungs in the same time, as through all the rest of the body ; the lungs constantly receive from the aorta branches which are named bronchial, and which, we must therefore sup- pose, are of considerable use. Were such arteries seen on the lungs only, they might be considered as accidental, or that the aorta scattering branches on all sides, sent some of these on the lungs; but we find the like in the liver, which receives a vast quantity of blood from the veins of all the other chy- lopoetic viscera : also an artery from the aorta ; nay, the heart receives blood to its right as well as left side, from the aorta, although, the pulmonary artery, but for some good reason, could as well, or better, have furnished it with a branch. Hence, upon the whole, we learn, that, by circulation, the blood becomes unfit for the purposes of the animal econo- * This paragraph was not written by my Father, nor the following note. + Reisseisen observes, if matter of different colours be thrown into the bron- chial artery and pulmonary vein, not only the inner surfaces of the bronchial tubes, but the vascular network, (formed by the smaller branches of the pul- monary and bronchial arteries, and the pulmonary vein), is also found to be tinged with both matters, and the roots of the minute veins may be seen insert- ed into the pulmonary vein.

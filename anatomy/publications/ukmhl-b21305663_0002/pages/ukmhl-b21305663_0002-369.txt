OF THE STRUCTURE OP NERVES. $23 Few nerves can be traced into the serous membranes, yet these membranes when inflamed are highly sensible. The , bones also receive few nerves; yet these, when diseased, give exquisite pain. Nerves may be traced into bone, and also into the teeth *. We have not vet been able to trace nerves into the cornea, the cuticle, the enamel of the teeth, nor into the membranes that envelope the foetus. The organs of sense receive their nerves from the brain, but the muscles, generally speaking, receive their nerves from the spinal cord. The nerves of the thorax, abdomen, and :pelvis, are derived from the ganglia of the sympathetic nerves, and par vagum of the eighth pair. When we examine, even with the utmost attention, the ter- minations of the nerves of the ear, nose, or eye, we discover no appearance of a neurilma. The optic nerve terminates in an expansion which has been described as greyish; but, in a very recent eye, I have re- marked that it is nearly transparent; it becomes greyish by keeping or immersion in spirits. After removing the cornea, iris and crystalline lens, upon looking through the eye, we see, on the temporal side of the optic nerve, a dark spot surrounded by a lemon-yellow -j- co- lour, which gradually becomes fainter from the central spot; but in the eye of a criminal, which I lately examined about six hours after he had been hanged, I could not observe any fold in the transparent retina, which Scemmerixg, the dis- coverer of this dark spot of the retina, has described so par- ticularly. The colour of this substance on the retina is by no means uniform : in different individuals, it varies between a yellow and an orange green. The portio mollis of the seventh pair of nerves terminates in a pulpy mass, which my Father discovered to form a very intimate plexus. The nerves distributed upon the skin and tongue terminate in the papillae proper to these organs. ■f Symp.’b Nomenclature of Colour*. x 3 * Mosao’g Nervous System.

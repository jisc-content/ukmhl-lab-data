There is every reason to suppose, that a somewhat, hurtful to the animal (Economy, is discharged along with the urine ; for the total suppression of this secretion, the removal of the kidneys, or ligatures thrown around the renal arteries, prove fatal in a short space of time. A partial suppression of urine, which often originates from an obvious cause, as from inflammation of the kidneys, gout, or calculi in the kidneys, is more frequent, and much less dangerous, than the complete suppression. The student should be aware of the difference between the suppression and retention of urine; which latter may be distinguished from the former, by pain and fulness in the region of the blad- der, which may be observed to be much distended; and if there be any difficulty in the diagnosis, the fluctuation of the urine may be felt, by introducing the fore-finger of one hand into the rectum, whilst that of the other is applied above the ossa pubis. By disease, the proportions of the ingredients of the urine are materially altered, and especially by organic derangements of the kidneys and bladder of urine, or by the effect of vari- ous irritations applied to these organs, and especially by concretions and other extraneous bodies, lodged within these, or by diseases of the prostate gland. In that remarkable disorder, called Diabetes, the urine, be- sides being secreted in extraordinary quantity, contains a good deal of sugar, and very little or no urea. According to Dr Henry and Mr Rose, there is no urea in the urine of persons afflicted by the acute chronic hepatitis. Fourciioy and Vauquelin found, in the urine of the jaundiced, a substance, analogous to the yellow acid which is formed by the action of the nitric acid on the muscular fibre.

ANALYSIS OF URINE. 131 Water, - - - 933.00 Urea, - 30.10 Sulphate of potash, - - 3-71 Sulphate of soda, - - 3.16 Phosphate of soda, - - 2.94 Muriate of soda, - - 4.45 Phosphate of ammonia, - 1-65 Muriate of ammonia, - - 1-50 Free lactic acid,—lactate of ammonia,—animal mat- ter soluble in alcohol, and usually accompany- ing the lactate,—animal matter insoluble in alco- hol,—urea not separable from the preceding, 17.14 Earthy phosphate, with a trace of fluate of lime, 1.00 Uric acid, * - 1.00 Mucus of the bladder, - - 0.32 Silex, - - 0.03 1000.00 * In old age, the urine is more highly charged with the earthy phosphates and uric acid; but the urine of a child, where the bones are not completely ossified, contains an excess of benzoic acid, and no phosphoric acid. Healthy urine contains, also occasionally, other ingredients : very often muriate of potash may be distinguished among the crystals which are formed during its evaporation. The physical properties of urine are often altered by the nature of the food, cr by medicines: rhubarb and turpentine affect the urine much ; the former communicates to it a golden colour, the latter gives it the smell of violets. The proportion of the ingredients of the urine is varied by the quantity of fluid that is drunk, and its chemical composi- tion by the time it is kept; for urine rapidly putrefies, and then contains an excess of ammonia: Also by the nature of the food; thus the uric acid becomes very abundant when little exercise is taken; and, on the other hand, it disappears. • Berzelius, in Annals of Phil. vol. ii. p. 423. i 2

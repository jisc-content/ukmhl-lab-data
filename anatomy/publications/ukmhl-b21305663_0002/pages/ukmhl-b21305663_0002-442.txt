ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 396 alternate concentric plates, between winch a very small quan- tity of aqueous fluid, secreted by the exhalant branches of the arteries, intervenes. The cornea is composed of plates, the innermost of which are thin and dense, in order to confine the aqueous humour. The laminae of the cornea are thinnest in the centre, in or- der to transmit light more readily, and in order that pressure may more readily render the cornea convex, while we are exa- mining objects very near to the eye. 3. he thin edge of the cornea lies over the sclerotic coat. Dumouiis observes, that if the eye be a little putrid, and then put into boiling water, the cornea may be lifted off the scle- rotic coat. The vessels of the cornea are very small, and do not, in a healthy state, admit red blood; in this case, secretion and nu- trition is performed by very small vessels. The component plates of the cornea may be readily sepa- rated from each other, and indeed are, during life, often se- parated by pus or blood. The cornea is covered by a continuation of the tunica ad- nata, which is a mucous membrane; and it has been stated to be lined by a thin membrane, which contains the aqueous hu- mour ; but concerning the existence of this membrane I en- tertain doubts. The cornea, in its sound state, possesses little or no sensibi- lity, but when inflamed, it acquires a considerable share of sensibility; so that when the inflamed or ulcerated cornea is divided by the knife, the patient suffers acute pain. In the foetus the cornea is proportionally thicker than in the adult. When the eye has been inflamed, there are a number of vessels conveying red blood, seen passing across the cornea. It has been matter of dispute, whether these are the ves- sels proper to the cornea, which have been enlarged, or are newly formed vessels. The latter of these opinions I hold to be the more correct; and hence they may be removed by the knife, or by external applications.

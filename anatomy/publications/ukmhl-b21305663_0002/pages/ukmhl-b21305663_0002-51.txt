25 OF THE HEART. Many experiments have been made upon the watery solu- tion, which, according to Buouet, contains albumen and iron. Soda is also contained in the watery solution; for it gives a green colour to the syrup violets. Dr Wells* endeavoured to prove, that the colouring principle of the blood was of an animal nature. Soon after Fourcroy and Vauquelin -f* made experiments upon the same subject, and imputed the colour of blood to a subphos- phate of iron ; which opinion has very lately been contradicted by Mr Brande, who has adopted Dr Wells’s opinion, and has concluded that the colouring substance is of an ani- mal nature, and, like many other animal colouring matters, may be employed in dyeing. His words are: “ There can, I think, be little doubt that the formation of the colouring matter of the blood is connect- ed with the removal of a portion of carbon and hydrogen from that fluid, and that its various tints are dependent upon such modifications of animal matter, and not, as some have as- sumed, upon the different states of oxidisement of the iron, which it has been supposed to contain.” SECTION VIII. OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE HEART. The heart is not essential to the circulation of the blood; it is not common to all animals, and even in those animals that are usually provided with a heart, the circulation may be carried on without it, and the animal be well nourished. The form, size, and structure of the heart vary in diffe- rent classes of animals ; there is no part of their structure which exhibits a greater variety or a nicer adaptation to a pe- culiar economy. “ The wisdom of the Creator,” says Hamburgher, “ is in nothing seen more gloriously than in the heart.” The heart is a hollow muscle of a conical form, situated • Philosoph.

123 OF THE STRUCTURE OF GLANDS. hepatic duct, than from the hepatic duct into the vena porta- rum, and as, when the common duct has been diminished, the hepatic duct is greatly enlarged ; notwithstanding which, in- jections cannot, without great difficulty, be pushed from it back into the vena portarum ; the secreting arteries seem to pass obliquely through the coats of the hepatic duct. “ Hence though the secerning arteries, and also the ducts, seem to be cylindrical, and that the ducts are the continua- tions of the arteries, I suspect that the arteries pass through the sides of the ducts obliquely. “ From what has been stated, there is reason to conclude, that the structure of the liver, pancreas, mammas, and testes, is as simple as that of the exhaling terminations of the arte- ries which secrete the liquors effused into the pleurae or peri- tonaeum ; or that the secretion of the semen from the branches of the spermatic arteries into the cavities of the convoluted ducts of the testicles, seems to be performed by means as sim- ple as, and similar to, the secretion of liquors into the cavities of the stomach and intestines. “ The fluids secreted by the different glands are of very different qualities, and accordingly have been arranged into the watery, oily, &c. “ These fluids are very different from the blood, and do not exist in it; so that the secerning apparatus possess the power not only of separating certain parts of the blood, but also of essentially altering its properties : hence the process of secre- tion cannot be compared to that of mere straining or transu- dation of a liquor. “ Many arguments present themselves in support of such an opinion. 1 st, There is no evidence of transudation taking place in the living body ; and the fluids derived from the different glands are very different from the blood. “ 2d, When a gland, or its duct, is irritated, the nature of the fluid secreted is altered, and the quantity of the secreted fluid is increased, as, during the salivation from mercury, cholera morbus ; or, to take the favourite instance of the pleu- ra, if it be admitted that the properties of the serous fluid on the surface of this membrane differ in health and disease, that

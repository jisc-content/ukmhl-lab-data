ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 140 accelerator urinae, and behind, with the skin and fat, and also with the extremity of the ossa coccygis, by means of a liga- mentous membrane. Upon removing this muscle, circular muscular fibres come into view, which have been described by Winslow and some other anatomists, as an internal sphyncter ; but these are mere- ly the circular muscular fibres of the intestinum rectum. This muscle may be ranked among the semivoluntary mus- cles, that is, it contracts so as to close the anus and retain the fasces, without our being consciolis of it, and that contraction is independent of the will; but at pleasure, by means of the muscles of the abdomen, we can overcome the resistance of this muscle. This muscle is often thrown into an inordinate state of contraction by the irritation of piles ; and when this happens the patient suffers acute pain in the pile, which still more in- creases the contraction of the sphyncter muscle, and the pain. As the extremity of the rectum is encircled and contracted by the sphyncter ani, extraneous bodies that have been swallowed, or calculi formed within the intestines, often have stuck within the rectum, and have proved a cause of much uneasiness. * The antagonists of this muscle are the longitudinal fibres of the rectum, and the abdominal muscles. There is a sort of balance between the action of the long-i- tudinal muscular fibres of the rectum and the sphyncter ani, so that when that balance is destroyed a prolapse of the rec- tum follows : hence, owing to repeated and violent straining at stool, or to the relaxation of the sphyncter muscle, often the concomitant of infancy and old age,—of the too long conti- nued use of emollient clysters,—of long continued diarrhoea or dysentery, a prolapsus ani sometimes takes place. So great is often the relaxation in weakly children, that a pro- lapse takes place without pain or violent exertion, every time they go to stool: the prolapse may be readily returned, • Vide Morbid Anatomy of the Stomach, Gullet, &c. 2

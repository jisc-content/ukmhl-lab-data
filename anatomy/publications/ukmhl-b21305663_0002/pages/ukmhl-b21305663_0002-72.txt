46 ELEMENTS OF ANATOM V. ly the colourless part of the blood, have been called Capillary. These constitute a considerable part of the animal frame. Many branches of the arteries terminate upon glands; others in exhaling arteries, which lubricate the surfaces of the serous membranes that line the cranium, the thorax, and abdomen ; besides which, there are numerous excerning arteries upon the surface of the skin, and internal surface of the lungs. Lastly, Some of the branches of the arteries terminate in the penis and clitoris, which have been by some authors sup- posed to be organs of a cellular structure. In short, by the capillary system many of the most import- ant functions of the body are performed, as nutrition, secre- tion, exhalation. These capillary arteries probably possess even a greater degree of muscular power than the larger branches ; they arc more under the influence cf passions of the mind: besides, the heart can have but little influence in propelling the blood through the smaller branches of the arteries ; the circulation of the blood in them must, therefore, be more the result of their own inherent muscular power than of the action of the heart. Of the Formation of Nero Arteries in cases of Wounds. When a part of the body has been wounded, the original arteries are either elongated, or new arteries are formed, which pass across the wound, and meet with those of the opposite side. SECTION X. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE VEINS. The veins which have no branches are somewhat of a cy- lindrical shape, but others are of a conical form. The veins take their origin, according to some authors, from the cells of the placenta, corpora cavernosa, penis, and clitoris, from the sinuses in the brain, or from other veins, as in the liver, and from the arteries.

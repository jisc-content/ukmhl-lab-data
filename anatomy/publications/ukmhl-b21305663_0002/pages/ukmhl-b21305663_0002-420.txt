374 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The middle or the most prominent lobes are lodged in the temporal fossa?, and the boundary between this and the pos- terior lobe is not well defined. The olfactory nerves, which are flattened, may be observed passing forwards, within distinct grooves of the brain, and terminating in an oval-shaped prominence, which lies on the crista galli of the ethmoid bone. - There is a cavity between the middle lobes of the brain, in the fore-part of which there are two white rounded cords, the optic nerves, which are united by a transverse portion. About one-eighth of an inch behind the decussation of the optic nerves, a small reddish funnel-shaped substance is seen, which is connected, by its smaller end, to the glandula pi- tuitaria, which is lodged in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. There are two white bodies, called Corpora albicantia, about the size of a garden-pea, which are situated about a quarter of an inch behind the infundibulum. On each side of the corpora albicantia, there is a rounded prominence, the crura cerebri, streaked by a number of furrows, which pass obliquely downwards and inwards, the fore-part of which is concealed by the middle lobe of the brain, and the posterior portion ends in a substance laid transversely across the brain, called Tuber annulare. A brown or black dark coloured substance, is found in the centre of the crura, which has been called Locus niger cru- rum cerebri. Besides the lamina of dark grey substance, I have observed a number of spots of a black substance, in the vicinity of the lamina of dark grey-coloured substance. Of the Cerebellum. The cerebellum occupies the inferior cavities of the occipi- tal bone, and is placed below the posterior lobes of the brain, and lies somewhat like a bridge over the superior surface of the medulla oblongata, but is not in contact with it; for the fourth ventricle intervenes.

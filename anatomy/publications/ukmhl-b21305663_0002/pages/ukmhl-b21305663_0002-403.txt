It is remarkable, that even in cases of long continued jaun- dice, occasioned by a diseased liver or spleen, though the skull and dura mater acquire a yellow or greenish hue, the cineritious or medullary part of the brain scarcely partakes of the same yellowish tint. The position of the grey in respect to the white part of the brain varies in different parts of the brain: in the hemi- spheres it is external, but in other parts of the brain, and in the spinal cord, internal. The white part constitutes the more considerable share of the hemispheres of the brain, and also a portion of the medulla oblongata, and medulla spinalis; and it is more abundant in the human brain than in any other. The grey part of the brain possesses but little or no sensi- bility. According to some authors *, it is the seat of the in- tellectual faculties, and the white matter the seat of sensi- bility. Different opinions have been entertained concerning the na- ture of the white matter. By some anatomists it has been 6tated, that it consists of a number of small tubes, disposed in a parallel manner in respect to each other; and by Vieussens, Malpighi, my Father, Cuvier, and others, it has been re- presented as fibrous. In the section of the recent brain, published by my Fa- ther, the fibres are represented as following different direc- tions, which corresponds exactly with Cuvier’s description of them, who, speaking of the white substance, has observed, “ elle paroit a Toil composee de fibres tres fines, dont les di- rections varient •j*.” The fibres of the white part of dhe brain are seen with the naked eye, by scraping the recent brain in the direction of the fibres, or by putting the brain for eight or ten minutes into boiling oil, or by immersing it in alcohol, or the nitric • Mr C.

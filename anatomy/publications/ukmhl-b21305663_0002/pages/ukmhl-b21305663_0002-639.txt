605 OF THE GRAVID WOMB. The mouth of the pregnant womb is widely different in appearance from that of the unimpregnated womb. At the ninth month it is flat; and there are a number of cavities on its inner side, containing a viscid jelly, which completely plugs up the mouth of the uterus. When delivery has com- menced, this jelly is detached. This viscid gluten is discharged along with the liquor am- nii, and exhibits a distinct cast of the lacunae of the orifice of the uterus, within which it had been lodged. The arteries of the uterus, at the ninth month, are very large and numerous, and freely communicate with each other, and upon the inner-side of the womb they are remarkably tortuous. The veins of the womb follow the same course as the arte- ries; are considerably larger than the arteries; and, on ac- count of their great size, have been named, by some anato- mists, venous sinuses. The lymphatic vessels of the uterus increase as much as the bloodvessels of that organ, in consequence of pregnancy, and are about the size of a common writing-pen. They are very numerous, and form a plexus over the greater part of the substance of the womb. Of the Membranes or Secundines at the Ninth Month. The placenta and membranes form a complete bag, which contains the foetus and liquor amnii. At the ninth month, we meet with three membranes only; the amnion, chorion, and decidua. The membrane next the foetus, called Amnion, is very thin and pellucid ; but in texture firm, and not readily torn. It lines the placenta; is reflected on the umbilical cord, and ter- minates at the navel; and is united to the chorion by means of a gelatinous substance. The membrane on the outer side of the amnion, called Chorion, i3 thicker than the amnion in some places, and nearly, transparent; and, in the earlier stages, exhibits a flocculent appearance, being,covered by a number of small vessels. It is fixed to the amnion by a jelly. The chorion gives a co-

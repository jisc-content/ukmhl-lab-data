532 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Walter Lucoe and Lobstein have stated, that they had traced small nerves into the substance of the arteries. Lobstein describes small twigs as passing from the super- ficial cardiac nerve of the right side, through the substance of the aorta into its second coat. Bock affirms, that minute branches from the sympathetic nerve enter the coats of the carotid artery. Though I have employed the term cellular web of the nerves, 1 did so only in obedience to general custom, and for want of a better name : it is more appropriate to call it the connecting membrane of the minuter ramifications of the nerves; for, if it be examined in a very recent body, it is found to be of a tougher, and of a much more compact na- ture,‘than cellular substance; it has somewhat of a silvery appearance, and, besides, it is not cellular; there are no inter- vening spaces between its layer, and I have never seen, even in the worst cases of dropsy, any watery fluid contained in it, or in cases of peritonites, purulent matter. As to the condition of the sympathetic nerve of the foetus, we have much accurate information from the laborious Lob- stein. For these minute details, I must refer my reader to the author himself, having only room to add, that he has stated the trunk of the sympathetic nerve to be distinct in the em- bryo of five months, forming a continuous thread, which ex- tended without interruption from the head to the pelvis. As to the state of this nerve in old age, like other nerves, it shrinks very much, and also the ganglia connected with it. With regard to the intimate structure of the sympathetic nerve, Lobstein differs from Bichat, who supposed the sympathetic nerve to be only a nerve connecting the several ganglia. He never found the sympathetic nerve to be inter- rupted either in the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis: he observes, “ sed tenerrima filamenta quae truncum componunt ganglia trajiciunt, tramite non interscisso.”

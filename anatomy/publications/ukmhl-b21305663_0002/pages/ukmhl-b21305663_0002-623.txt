OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS. 575 There are also lymphatic vessels, which arise from the rete testis, and from the epidydimis. The various lymphatic vessels of the testes pass into the lumbar glands. The lymphatic vessels of the scrotum enter the upper and inner inguinal glands; but those which are deeper, accom- pany the lymphatic vessels of the testicle, and end in the iliac glands. There are two sets of lymphatic vessels proper to the penis. Those that are superficial take their origin from the prepuce; unite and run chiefly upon the dorsum penis ; and, at the root of the penis, they divide into right and left branches, which pass into the corresponding inguinal glands. The deeper seated lymphatic vessels take their origin from the glans penis, and accompany the arteries of the penis into the under part of the pelvis. The lymphatic vessels of the womb are rarely seen in the unimpregnated state. They follow the course of the blood- vessels, and pass into the iliac glands. These vessels, like to the bloodvessels, are much enlarged from pregnancy. The lymphatic vessels of the external organs of generation of the female, pass into the inguinal glands. The greater number of them pass through the inguinal canals, along with the round ligaments of the womb, and they ultimately end in the iliac glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the lower part of the abdomen, and those of the loins, also pass into the inguinal glands. The lymphatic vessels of the bladder of urine are not often seen ; they follow the course of the veins of that organ, and pass into small lymphatic glands at the neck of the bladder, and ultimately into the iliac and lumbar glands. Of the Lymphatic Vessels of the Intestines and Stomach. The lymphatic vessels of the intestinum rectum, and of the greater intestines in general, are small, and are rarely seen,

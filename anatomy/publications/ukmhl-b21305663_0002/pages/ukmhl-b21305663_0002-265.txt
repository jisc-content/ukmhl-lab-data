OF THE ORIFICE OF THE VAGINA. 22 S than usual. Mr Bryce informs me, that he once met with an instance in which the vagina was only two inches long, and ended in the blind sac. There was no uterus, for by passing the finger into the rectum, the bladder of urine could be plainly distinguished. A contraction of the vagina is the effect of original mal- conformation, or of an adhesion, the consequence of difficult labour. In some instances, the vagina is not of its usual length. The vagina, though very rarely, has been divided by a partition extending from one end of it to the other, but more frequently a membrane has been observed to pass transverse- ly across it, and this membrane is commonly placed behind the hymen. OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF GENERATION. The external parts are the Mons Veneris, Labia externa, Nymphae, Clitoris, and opening into the vagina. The labia externa, which are very prominent in fat women, are thicker above than below, and internally are lined by a mucous membrane, which in young women is of a red colour, but in old womer of a purple colour. The labia externa are in contact with each other, excepting when the thighs are separated, and they cover, conceal, and defend the more internal and delicate parts. The labia externa are fixed by cellular substance to the symphysis pubis; they are somewhat of an oval form, and are in the adult covered by hair. The labia descend from the symphysis pubis, and are united about an inch from the anus by a transverse bridle, called fourchette; these have been named the labia externa. The labia externa, when cut into, are found to be com- posed of thin cellular membrane, sebaceous glands, and fat ; and their inner surfaces are lubricated by a quantity of se- baceous substance. Upon separating the labia externa from each other, a little rounded body, of a red colour, about one- eighth of an inch long, comes into view, which is in shape the miniature of the male penis, and which, like it, is covered by a

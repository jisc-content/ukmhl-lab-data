368 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. part of its sheath from the dura mater, and that again closely to the skin, which was much thinner than common, without the intervention of cellular membranes with fat; so that at first sight, the spinal marrow seemed to be wanting; and can- not help suspecting, that some similar case has given rise to that incredible notion, propagated very generally by many authors, that the spinal marrow is sometimes changed into water ; and this again, with the great quantity of water some- times found in the ventricles of the brain, has led into the opi- nion of a similar mutation in the brain; but which, in place of becoming softer than ordinary, I have always found harder and tougher in such cases.‚Äù The concretion of the spinal marrow to the dura mater and teguments, shews the danger that may attend tapping in the Spina bifida. Between the commissura mollis and thalami nervorum op- ticorum, the foramen commune posterius is placed, which has been said to form a communication between the back-part of the third and lateral ventricles; but it is shut up by the tela choroidea. The lateral ventricles being fully exposed, the following parts come into view. In the anterior cornu of each lateral ventricle, there are two very obvious projections, viz. the Corpus striatum and Thalamus or Colliculus nervi optici, and the Choroid plexus. The corpora striata are externally smooth, of a brown co- lour, and in shape pyriform, broad before, and narrow be- hind ; and, when divided, are found to be composed partly of cineritious and partly of white matter ; and hence exhibit, when divided, a striated appearance; but, in some instances, I have observed merely a layer of medullary matter, about half an inch in thickness, extending from the anterior to the posterior surface of the corpora striata. The corpus striatum, like the rest of the lateral ventricle, is lined by its proper membrane, and water sometimes de- taches this membrane from the body of the corpus striatum. I have often seen a part of the corpus striatum destroyed, 3

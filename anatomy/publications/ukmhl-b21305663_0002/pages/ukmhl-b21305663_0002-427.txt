or THE BLOODVESSELS OF THE BltAIN. S8l the physiology of the different parts of the brain is involved in great obscurity. How can we reconcile our supposed notions as to a know- ledge of the functions of the brain, with the notorious fact, that a large quantity of water is sometimes accumulated with- in the brain, when there has existed no one symptom which denoted its presence, excepting the increased volume of the head ? Of the Bloodvessels of the Brain. The brain receives a large supply of blood by four arteries, called the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. According to the calculations of Haller, one-fifth part of the whole blood is sent to the brain, which he stated to be about the fortieth part of the body. But this estimate, according to my Father, is too great : in his opinion, only one-tenth or one-twelfth of the whole blood is sent to the brain. According to Mr Bauer’s microscopical observations, every part of the brain has innumerable bloodvessels, which are of considerable size towards the centre; but branch out to an extreme degree of minuteness, even less than the half diame- ter of a red globule with its colouring matter; and although reduced to that size, the fluid they carry is red. Their branches are accompanied by vessels of still less diameter, having valves, which are at short distances. These minute vessels, according to Sir E. Home, must perform the office of lymphatics. They carry, according to him, the absorbed matter into the superior longitudinal sinus. of the internal carotid or cerebral artery. The INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, follows a tortUOUS COUl’Se upon the rectus capitis major muscle, before entering the carotid canal. 1 he artery having passed through the above canal, is di- rected upwards ; then turns horizontally ; enters the caver- nous sinus, and perforates the dura mater, at the side of the anterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone.

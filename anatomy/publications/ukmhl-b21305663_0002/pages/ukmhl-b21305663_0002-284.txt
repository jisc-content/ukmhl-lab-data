240 ELEMENTS OE ANATOM V. and platysma-myoides muscles, and upon the muscles which are fixed to the os hyoides, larynx, and the membrane of the larynx. The trunk of the artery always communicates with the cor- responding artery of the opposite side, and also with the in- ferior thyroid artery, a branch of the subclavian artery. A considerable branch of this artery enters the larynx between the thyroid cartilage and os hyoides, or sometimes it passes through the thyroid cartilage, and then divides into small branches, which are spent upon the membrane of the epiglot- tis, and arytenoid muscles. Within these few years, several cases have been publish- ed, in which that very dangerous operation, the extirpation of the thyroid gland, has been performed, I subjoin the history of one of the operations as performed by Hedenus of Berlin ; who informs us he had operated suc- cessfully six times. Â« X then divided the skin in a longitudinal direction, with a convex-edged bistoury, from the os hyoides to the top of the sternum : not being able by this means to form any flap, I dissected back the skin and platysma myoides on both sides from above down, so as to form a flap of two inches, and turned back on either side. I then saw the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, much increased in size, and firmly fixed to the whole tumour, and destitute of the usual aponeu- roses : these I endeavoured, for the sake of sparing them in the operation, to dissect and separate from the swelling. Scarcely had I dissected away a quarter of an inch, when blood streamed in great quantity from numerous small ar- teries, which could neither be tied, on account of their mi- nuteness, nor restrained by any styptic application, since theii mouths were retracted and hid beneath the strong and firm aponeurosis which invested the tumour, so that they could not be reached or withdrawn. I gave up, therefore, the at- tempt to separate these muscles, and came immediately to the resolution of cutting them through at their points of attachment above and below, and removing the included portions with the tumour. I next (continues our author,) separated the

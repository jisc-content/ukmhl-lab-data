()12 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. there is, at an average, an increase of fifteen times for each month. The younger the foetus, the greater the proportion of the head to the trunk. The foetus does not increase in size in proportion to its age. In the second months it has been said to grow more slow- ly, in the third more quickly, in the fourth more slowly; but from the middle of the fourth month to the sixth, it grows more rapidly; and between the sixth and ninth month, more slowly. The embryo in the first and second month is a little bent. In the fourth and fifth, from the addition of its extremities, it seems folded up. After the second month, the head grows more slowly. The face, in a young foetus, bears a small proportion to the brain-case. The foetus at first seems to have no neck. It weighs only about 3 1. The eyes appear at first like black circles: before the third month, the eye-lids are either open, or so thin, that the eye- ball shines through them. There are little pores in the situation of each ear about the ninth week : but the external ears are not complete until the fifth month. About the eighth week the nose appears. Two small apertures may be observed at first, and it is complete about the twelfth week. The mouth is large at first, and is visible about the seventh week, but not the lips ; they begin to be formed about the tenth week, and at the twelfth, are quite distinct The organs of generation are manifest at the fourth month. In the fourth month, the foetus is about five inches long. In the fifth month, the foetus is about six or seven inches in length. In the sixth month, the foetus is eight or nine inches long, and perfect in its shape and formation. The parts of the eye are formed, and the pupil is covered by a membrane, called

OF THE SACRAL NERVE. 543 toes, and terminated in the extremities of the toes ; and the branches of the nerves of opposite sides communicate freely, so as to form a plexus of bloodvessels upon the points of the toes. EXPLANATION OF PLATE XII. The two figures in this Plate, represent the posterior part of the human iris, after the paint has been washed. The object of the plate is to represent the peculiar arrangement of the muscular fibres of the iris; the muscular structure of which has been denied by those distinguished Anatomists Baron Haller and Wrisberg. Fig. 1. Shews the iris of its natural size; and Fig. 2. repre- sents it magnified. A A The inner side of the inferior part of the Choroid Coat. B B The Ciliary Processes. CC The Vessels and Radiated Fibres. D D The Muscular Sphincter of the Iris. E E The Pupil. While writing the explanation of this Plate, I happened to turn up the Anatomical and Physiological Commentaries of Mr Herbert Mayo, and found that he had made the fol- lowing experiments to determine the cause of the movements of the iris. “ 1. When the optic nerves are divided in the cranial cavity of a living pigeon, the pupils become fully dilated, and do not contract on the admission of intense light. “ 2. When the third nerves are divided in the cranial cavity of a living pigeon, the same result ensues: in both these cases the surface of the eye-ball retains its feeling. “ 3. When the fifth nerve has been divided on one side in the cranial cavity of a living pigeon, the iris on that side con- tracts as usual on the admission of light, but the surface of the eye-ball appears to have lost its feeling. “ 4. When the optic nerves are pinched in the cranial cavity of a living pigeon, or immediately after its decapitation, the pupils are contracted for an instant on each injury of the nerves.

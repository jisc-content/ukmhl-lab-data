ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY". 398 ment in the eyes of oxen and calves has been published by Leopold Gmelin * From 500 eyes of oxen and calves, he collected 75 grains of this substance. Its colour is blackish- brown. It is tasteless, and adheres to the tongue like clay. It is insoluble in water, alcohol, sulphuric ether, oils, lime- water, and distilled vinegar. It dissolves in potash and am- monia, by the assistance of heat, and is again precipitated by acids. Sulphuric acid dissolves it, and blackens the co- lour. Muriatic acid produces the same change of colour, but forms only an imperfect solution. Nitric acid dissolves it, and changes its colour to reddish-brown. Twelve and a half grains (Troy) of the pigment were subjected to heat in a glass-tube; a few drops of water came over, holding carbo- nate of ammonia in solution, a brown oil, and crystals of car- bonate of ammonia. The gas extricated amounted to six cu- bic inches (6.17 cubic inches English), which consisted of Carbonic acid gas, - 3-000 Oxygen gas, - 0.159 Azotic gas, - 2.131 Carburetted hydrogen, - 0.710 6.000 The water, oil, and carbonate of ammonia that came over into the receiver weighed 5 grains ; and the oil alone amount- ed to one-third of the weight of the whole. The coal re- maining in the retort weighed 5| grains. It consisted almost entirely of charcoal. When burnt it left /2ths of a grain of ashes, which consisted of soda, lime, oxide of iron, and mu- riatic acid, and probably also phosphoric acid, and carbonic acid. Gmelin conceives that this black pigment approaches the nature of indigo. The choroid coat is chiefly composed of a number of very small arteries and veins, joined by fine cellular substance; and, after a successful injection of its bloodvessels, it assumes a deep-red colour. This coat is fixed to the sclerotic by fine cellular substance, by bloodvessels and nerves, excepting at Leopold Gmelin, in Schvveiggerâ€™s Journ. vol. x. p. 507.

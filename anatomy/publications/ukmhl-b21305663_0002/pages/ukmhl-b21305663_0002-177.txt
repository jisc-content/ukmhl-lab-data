OF THE PERINiEUM. 139 effused fluid, occasioning a considerable swelling, which at length bursts. The progress of the disease may, in many cases, be arrest- ed, bv making an incision in the perinseum. The muscles attached to the perinseum are the spliyncter ani, the transversulis perin&i, the levator ani, accelerator uri- na, erector penis, and the coccygeus muscles. The first is a single muscle, the other five are in pairs. The dissection of these muscles is to be conducted in the following manner: A semicircular cut is to be made on each side of the anus, which should meet at the posterior part of it, from which an incision is to be continued to the extremity of the ossa coccy- gis. This dissection is to be continued, carrying the knife sometimes backwards and sometimes forwards, so as to expose one-half of the cutaneous spliyncter ani, and the acceleratores urinae. One-half of the cutaneous spliyncter is to be raised from the fat as far as the verge of the anus. This loose half of the sphyncter is to be held firmly towards the other half of the in- ternal spliyncter, till it be cleaned by raising the fat. From the posterior extremity of the accelerator urinae, an incision is to be made transversely, so as to expose the trans- versalis perinaei, and a part of the levator ani. An incision is to be made at the side of the os ischium, to expose the crus penis covered by its erector muscle. The acceleratores urinae are exposed, by dividing the skin over the raphe; and, in order to show the levator ani, it is re- quired to remove a good deal of fat which covers it, and af- terwards to dissect its origins from the inner side of the pelvis. Of the Sphyncter Ani. The extremity of the rectum is surrounded by an oval- shaped muscle, which is placed immediately under the skin, and has been called, on account of its office, sphyncter ani. The fibres of this muscle are parallel to each other, and, at the anterior perinaeum, are closely connected with those of the

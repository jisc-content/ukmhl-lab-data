OF THE WHITE MATTER OF THE BRAIN. 359 which it acquires from the mucus, the bond of union between its component globules. The o-lobules form the fibres. c* According to De la Torre, the brain and cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, and also the white part of the nerves, are composed of transparent globules swimming in a jluicl. Prochaska observes, that both the cineritious and white parts are composed of innumerable round globules, united by a transparent cellular membrane, disposed in right lines, and which round bodies are about eight times less than the red globules. According to Messrs Joseph and Charles Wenzel, the globules put on the appearance of cells, filled by the white substance ; and these globules seem to adhere to each other closely by a gelatinous substance. The size of the globules is not uniform in different brains ; and they differ as to size in the different parts of the same brain. Mr Bauer perceived, by the aid of his microscope, in the recent human brain, which had been steeped in distilled water, globules proceed- ing in sti'aight lines from the cortical into the white part; so that the brain has a fibrous appearance. The size of the globules, he observes, varies from to 55A0 of an inch; and they vary in size in different parts of the brain *. The different appearance in the different parts of the brain de- pends on the size of the globules, and the proportions they bear to the other parts. These globules are united by a ge- latinous substance. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1824, p. 1., a figure is given of the human brain, in a recent state, which had been immersed in distilled water, and which is magnified 200 times. The globules are seen very distinctly arranged in rows: and 1 ig. 2. of the same Plate, in which the brain is magnified 25 times, shews “ the arrangement of the globules in straight lines, which pass uninterruptedly across the corti- cal substance into the medullary.” Phil. Trans, for 1818, and 1821, p. 27.

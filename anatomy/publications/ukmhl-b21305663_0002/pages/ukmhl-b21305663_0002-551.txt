OF THE SPINAL NE11YES. 505 former, the power of motion depends; and, on the lat- ter, sensibility. lie concluded, that the brain and smaller brain, “ were parts distinct, in function, and that every nerve, possessing a double function, obtained that, by having a double root.” He adds, “ Such nerves as are single in their origin from the spinal mrrrow, will be found either to unite in their course with some other nerves, or to be such as are acknowledged to be peculiar in their operation.” The opi- nion of Mr Bell has been confirmed by the subsequent ex- periments of Majendie. Dr Bellingeri of Turin, lately made experiments on the nerves of die spine of sheep and horses. He states, that the posterior roots of the lumbar and sacral nerves communicate the power of extension in quadrupeds; the anterior roots of the same nerves, on the contrary, give rise only to the power of flexion. The posterior roots alone preside over the sense of touch. The white substance of the spinal cord, and nervous fila- ments arising therefrom, are destined for movement; the grey matter, on the contrary, and the nerves arising from it, are the organs of touch *. The nerves connected with the spinal marrow pass off at more acute angles, as we trace them downwards to the lower end of the spinal marrow. The nervous filaments below the termination of the spinal marrow as a single cord, or lower than the second lumbar vertebra, are disposed in a parallel manner in respect to each other, and somewhat like the hairs in a horse’s tail; hence that portion of the spinal marrow has been called cauda equina. The posterior branches of the spinal marrow in the neck are connected to each other by smaller nerves. On the outside of the dura mater, the spinal nerves are con- nected on their fore part to a nerve called the great sympa- • Vide a more full description of the spinal marrow, in my Father’s Trea- tise on the Nervous System, p. 28, 2D. &c.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 280 .The larger branches of this artery on the left side convey blood to the jejunum and ileum; and these branches anasto- mose with each other by transverse arches. The larger branches of this artery on the right side are placed between the layers of the mesocolon, and have been named, 1^, The colica media, which supplies the middle of the transverse arch of the colon, takes its rise under the du- plicature of the mesocolon: and the left branch of this ar- tery communicates with the colica sinistra, and inferior me- senteric artery. Sd, The Deoctra; by means of which the right side of the colon is supplied with blood. This vessel anastomoses with the colica media, and there are many small branches sent off from this artery. 3d, Small branches, which are distributed on the omen- tum, and communicate with the arteriae gastro-epiploicae. 4th, The tleo-colic, which supplies that part of the ileum which terminates in the colon; and from which a branch is derived, which communicates with the colica dextra. A branch of this artery supplies the appendix vermiformis. Of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. The inferior mesenteric artery is smaller than the su- perior mesenteric. This artery takes its rise from the left side of the aorta, between the renal arteries and iliacae communes: it descends behind the peritonaeum to the left side, upon the psoas muscle, and soon divides into an ascending branch, and the left colic artery: the former supplies the colon with blood; and communicating with the colica media, forms the great mesocolic arch: the latter supplies the sigmoid flexure of the colon, called Hamorrhoidalis Interna. The continuation of the trunk of the artery descends behind the back part of the intestinum rectum, which it supplies with blood. A ligature may be thrown around the abdominal aorta, and

ELEMENTS OF ANATOM V. SECTION III. OF THE SOFTER PARTS CONNECTED WITH THE RONES OF THE CHEST. Of the Mammaz. The mammae, or breasts, are somewhat of a hemispherical shape, and adhere to the anterior part of the greater pectoral muscle, by means of cellular substance. The breasts of the male are termed Mammillae. â€¢ The size of the breasts is very various at different periods of life. At birth they are large, and equal in size in both sexes; and a small quantity of a mucous fluid may then be squeezed out of them in either sex. A short time before, or about the period of puberty, they grow rapidly in the female. At the approach of the menses the breasts enlarge; but, at the cessation of the menses, they shrink. The mammae attain a large size towards the latter months of utero-gestation; and, from their weight, become pendulous, while a woman is a nurse; the cellular substance uniting the gland to the pectoral muscle, being much elongated. The mammae of some savage nations, as the Hottentots, are fre- quendy so long, that the mother can suckle her child whilst she carries it on her back. The mammae, in appearance, are white and firm, but irre- gular in substance, and are composed of glandular follicles, lactiferous ducts, fat, bloodvessels, nerves, and lymphatie vessels. From the glandular parts of the mammae, the smaller lac- tiferous tubes arise, which are united into twelve or sixteen larger tubes, most of which open near to the apex of the co- nical-shaped projection of the mamma, called its Papilla. The larger lactiferous ducts diverge through the substance

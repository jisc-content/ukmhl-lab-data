OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 230 began my incision opposite the middle of the thyroid carti- lage, from the base of the tumour, and extended it to within an inch of the clavicle on the inner side of the sterno-mastoid muscle. On raising the margin of this muscle, the omo-hy- oideus could be distinctly seen crossing the sheath of the ves- sels, and the nervus dcscendens noni was also exposed. I next separated the mastoid from the omo-hyoideus muscle, and the jugular vein became apparent, which being distend- ed at every expiration, spread itself over the artery. Draw- ing aside the vein the par vagum was evident, lying between it and the carotid artery, but a little to its outer side. This nerve was easily avoided : a blunt iron probe, constructed for the purpose, was then passed under the artery, carrying a double ligature with it. Two ligatures being thus convey- ed under the artery, the lower was immediately tied. I next detached the artery from the surrounding parts to the extent of an inch above the lower ligature, and then tied the upper. Lastly, a needle and thread were passed through the artery above one ligature and below the other. The division of the artery was then performed.” SECTION II, OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES* The External Carotid Artery ascends upwards* nearly in a line parallel to the ascending process of the lower jaw, and is placed about half way between the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the angle of the under-jaw. It passes behind the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the stylo-hyoid, taking protection from the angle of the under jaw-bone. The first branch, called Superior Thyroid, comes off at the place of division of the common carotid, and descends, fol- lowing a tortuous course to the upper part, or sometimes near to the middle, of the thyroid gland: it then suddenly divides •nto branches, which are distributed upon the sterno-mastoid

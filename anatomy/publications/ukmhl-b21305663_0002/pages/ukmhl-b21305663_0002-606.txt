ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 558 and pancreas, at the intercostal spaces, and at the division of the windpipe into its two great branches. No lymphatic glands have yet been detected within the skull: I think I have seen the lymphatic glands at the side of the optic nerve swelled in a case of fungus hoematodes, and in a case of cancer of the eye-ball. No lymphatic glands have been observed in the hand or fore-arm, or in the feet and legs; and but one or two small glands have been detected on the surface of the trunk of the body. The lymphatic glands are covered by a dense coat, of a grey colour, which has a shining appearance, and which is fixed down to the neighbouring parts by cellular substance, and upon this coat several small branches of arteries and veins are distributed. Two different opinions have been entertained as to the mi- nute structure of these glands. My Father was led, from a careful examination of his preparations, to conclude that the lymphatic vessel which en- ters a gland, is subdivided within it into very minute branches, which form continuous canals, with very small branches of the lymphatics which issue out from the gland. Nuck * has endeavoured to prove, that there is a good deal of cellular substance in the composition of the lymphatic glands which is included within a membrane; that the lym- phatic vessels of the first order enter upon one side, pour the lymph into the cells, and, passing out from the opposite side, convey the lymph to the heart. Cowpeu entertains the same opinion as to the structure of these glands, of which he published figures. My Father always denied the existence of cells in the glands connected with the lymphatics of the human body, and used to state, that, perhaps the appearance of cells was produced by uneven sections of the lymphatic vessels, or by the bursting of the vessels and effusion of the quicksilver, or other liquor employed, into the cellular substance. * Vide Adenographia, p. 27.

610 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. cal cord, there is a hag of an oval form, called vesiculanlba^ filled by a fluid. It is placed about an inch from the inser- tion of the navel-string into the placenta. The vesicula alba is found only at the commencement of pregnancy. The quantity of the liquor amliii, is proportionally greater in the first than in the latter months of pregnancy. When the foetus is very young, it is in immediate contact with the membranes, but by degrees it recedes; and it is con- nected to the placenta by the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord is at first very short and flat; at the period of birth it is commonly about two feet long. The length and thickness of the cord vary in different individuals. The urachus constitutes a part of the umbilical cord 4 it ascends from the fundus of the bladder, and is inserted into the navel-string. The uterus rapidly increases in size, in consequence of the determination of blood to it. The difference in the size of the uterus, at the same period of utero-gestation, is considerable in different women ; it de- pends on the size and number of the foetuses, and also on the quantity of liquor amnii. The uterus does not rise so much, as to be sensibly felt above the ossa pubis, till after the fourth month of preg- nancy. The fundus uteri is in the first place distended, and then the neck of that organ. The mouth of the pregnant uterus is directed backwards, so that the axis of the uterus corresponds with that of the pelvis. At the fourth month, the womb measures about five inches from the fundus to the beginning of its neck. . At the sixth month, it extends about four inches above the pubis. At the eighth month, the uterus reaches half way between the navel and sternum; and, at the ninth month, it reaches as far up as the ensiform cartilage of the sternum. The above measurements are not invariably the same;

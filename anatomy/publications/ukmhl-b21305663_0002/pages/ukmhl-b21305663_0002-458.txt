412 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. the foetus frequently turbid; and., according to Chenevix, it consists of jelly, albumen, water, and muriate of soda. Different opinions have been entertained respecting the source of this humour. Zinn has stated, that this humour is secreted by the capil- lary vessels of the iris. This humour is very quickly regenerated. As the aqueous humour is nearly of the same density as water, therefore it cannot refract the rays of light; conse- quently it could be of no use to fishes, and in them it is awanting; but as, when birds soar to the higher regions of the atmosphere, the air is much rarified, the refrangibility of the aqueous humour is more considerable; and hence, in birds, there is a considerable quantity of this humour of the eye. The aqueous humour is said to be contained in a mem- brane which is continued over the iris, and gives to that mem- brane its elasticity, which is so very remarkable in birds. Des-Mours has described the membrane that contains the aqueous humour as being of a cartilaginous nature,—an opi- nion which has also been adopted by Dr Jacob *, who sup- poses, that thus the cornea “ preserves correctly the regular degree of curvature.” This membrane may be demonstrated readily, after an eye has been, for a few days, in water, or after separating the cor- nea, if it be put into boiling water. Of the Crystalline Lens. This humour has been called Crystalline Lens, being like transparent crystal, and in its form like a double convex lens. It is placed in the middle axis of the eye, behind the pupil. The anterior surface is opposed to the back of the iris, and its posterior part is imbedded in the vitreous humour. The human crystalline lens varies in colour and figure at different periods of life: in the foetus it is reddish, but soon after birth becomes transparent, and nearly spherical; in mid- dle life it is transparent, and in figure like a double convex lens, • Medico-Chir.

414 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. It may be asked, Why is not the lens of an uniform densi- ty ? This question it may be difficult to solve. Mr IIams- den supposes that it tends to correct the aberration occasion- ed by the spherical form of the cornea, where he supposes the principal refraction takes place. Owing to the particular structure of the lens, he supposes that it refracts without re- flecting any of the rays of light, so that, though there are two surfaces of the aqueous, of the crystalline lens, and of the vi- treous humour, yet there is only one reflected image; and that being on the front of the cornea, there is no surface to reflect it back, and to render the image, upon the retina, less distinct. If the surfaces of the crystalline lens had been abrupt, there must have been a reflection at each. ' â€˜ As the centre of the lens is much more dense than the cir- cumference of it, thus the aberration, occasioned by the sphe- rical surface of the cornea, is corrected, and the focus of each oblique pencil of rays falls accurately on the concave surface of the retina. The particular structure of the lens is subservient to another purpose. The image of the object which strikes the retina, is free from any prismatic colours, occasioned by the different refran- gibility of the rays of light; which would have rendered the picture confused. The capsule adheres but slightly to the body of the lens; a small quantity of water being said, by most authors, to be interposed. The lens may be readily detached by slight pressure, after puncturing the capsule. The anterior portion of the capsule is not only very pellu- cid, but also very elastic; but the back part of it is much softer and thinner. I never could find any liquor between the posterior part of the lens and its capsule. My assistant Mr Mackenzie informs me, that he cannot find any of the liquor Morgagni in the eye of the ox, sheep

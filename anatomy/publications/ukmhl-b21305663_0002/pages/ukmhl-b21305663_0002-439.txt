393 OF THE EYE-13ALL. The human eye, that of monkeys, of dogs, and of many birds, is directed forwards, and the eyes of many birds are so placed as to take in a hemisphere. Those of the hare and rabbit are so prominent, and placed so much towards the side of the head, as to enable them to see objects behind as well as before them. The eyes of most animals may be moved in different direc- tions, upwards, downwards, and sideways; and in the com- mon snail the eyes are appended, like black spots, to the ex- tremities of the horns, in order that the eyes may be moved in different directions: and when the animal cannot move its head, the defect is compensated by the situation and number of the eyes; thus spiders have four, six, or sometimes eight eyes, placed in the front of the head. Of the Coats of the Eye-Ball. There are three coats proper to the eye-ball : the Sclerotic and Choroid coats, and the Retina. Besides these, the Tu- nica adnata passes over the anterior surface of the eye, by which the eye-ball is fixed in its place, and this coat also serves to prevent extraneous bodies from passing from the fore to the back part of the orbit. A small quantity of fine cellular membrane, in which there are a great many bloodvessels, intervenes between this coat and the sclerotic coat of the eye. Of the Sclerotic Coat. The tunica sclerotica is of a greyish-white colour, firm, opaque, tough, elastic, and and composed of a number of small fibres, which cross each other m different directions These are not obvious in the human eye, on account of the small size of the fibres which enter into its composition, and the very intimate manner in which these fibres are inter- woven with each other; but in the zvhale the fibres are much larger, and their progress may be readily traced; they decus- sate each other, and the intervals between them are filled up by dense and white cellular substance.

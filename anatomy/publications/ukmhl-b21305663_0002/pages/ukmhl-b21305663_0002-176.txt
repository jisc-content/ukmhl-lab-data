ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 138 SECTION III. OP THE DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM OF THE MALE, AND OF THE MUSCLES CONNECTED WITH IT. The muscles, bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbent vessels of the perinaeum, are involved in a considerable quantity of cellular substance and fat: hence much caution and time are requisite in the examination of this very important part of the human frame. Before beginning the dissection of the perinaeum, it is ne- cessary to study the bones of the pelvis, to introduce a staff within the urethra, and to fill the rectum with baked hair, or with a cork, after having washed out its contents. The body of the subject is to be placed with the lower ex- tremities bent, and the knees drawn upwards, as when the surgeon is about to perform the lateral operation of lithotomy, whilst an assistant raises and holds up the scrotum. The common integuments are to be divided from the anterior verge of the anus to the root of the scrotum, by which a fas- cia of a tendinous nature is exposed. In some subjects, there is so much fat under the skin, that when it has been divided, as in performing the lateral opera- tion for lithotomy, the opposite sides fall together, and pre- vent the surgeon from seeing the deeper parts. On removing the skin over the perinaeum, a strong tendi- nous fascia comes into view, which is fixed to the ossa ischia and pubis, and also, to the tendinous aponeurosis of the mus- cles of the thigh, and which is loosely connected with the cel- lular substance of the scrotum.- This fascia prevents the escape of matter found here, and also the effusion of urine, when the urethra has been rup- tured : hence, when the urine has escaped, and has form- ed a swelling in the perinaeum, the urine passes upwards to the scrotum, which being of a loose texture,^yields before the

These ducts are large in some women, and have been by some authors called Prostata, niu- liebres; in a few women there are slits on the surface of the mu- cous membrane of the vagina. The outer coat is of a firm consistence; but in which the muscular fibres are not very obvious ; notwithstanding which, it possesses, to a certain extent, a contractile power. This coat is connected with the adjacent parts, by cellular substance, and the upper and back part of the vagina is co- vered by the peritonaeum. Of the Orifice of the Vagina. The orifice of the vagina is about half an inch below the symphysis pubis, and surrounded and contracted by its cor- pus spongiosum, and its sphyncter muscle. Its aperture in virgins is very small, being contracted by the hymen, a semi- lunar-shaped membrane, the concave part of which looks up- wards, and in the upper part of which there is an aperture, through which the menses are discharged. The sphyncter vagina arises from the sphyncter ani. It sur- rounds the anterior part, and contracts the lower part of the vagina, and pressing upon the plexus retiformis of the vagina, is connected with the sphyncter ani : in some women it is a large and very distinct muscle; and is fixed into the crura clitoridis, where they are united to each other. These veins are of very considerable size, and may be compressed by those muscular fibres which are said to form the sphyncter vagina. The vagina is largely supplied with bloodvessels. The transversalis perinai of the female is similar as to its origin with the corresponding muscles of the male : it is fixed into the sphyncter vaginae, and sphyncter ani. The orifice of the urethra is placed above that of the vagi- na, to which latter it adheres immediately. The vagina has been found contracted, and also shorter

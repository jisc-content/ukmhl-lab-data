OF THE PHRENIC NERVE. 521 axillary glands, and parts in their vicinity, on the inner side’ of the arm. One of the intercosto-humeral nerves joins with the inter- nal cutaneous of Wrisberg, and afterwards sends several very small nerves, which are distributed on the axillary glands, on the back-part of the arm. I received the arm of a soldier, that had been amputated, on account of the very excruciating pain, which he had, for several years suffered, and which very much resembled that kind of pain which accompanies an irritation applied to a nerve. From the account the patient gave, the pain which came in paroxysms followed the course of the median nerve, and had been occasioned by a wound from a bayonet. Conceiving that the patient’s sufferings originated from an injured nerve, I requested of my assistant Mr Mackenzie to throw a fine injection into the bloodvessels of the arm, and then to examine the nerves, with great care. He accordingly did so; the median and ulnar nerves were evidently enlarged, and in a high state of inflammation ; and the injection had proved so successful, that the above, and the cutaneous nerves, resembled red cords, and bear a very strong resemblance to an artery that has been filled by a red injection ; for the va- rious threads, or rather fasciculi of the nerves, are by no means so obvious as in a healthy nerve. Of the Nerves of the Chest. The nerves which supply the parietes of the chest, and parts contained within it, are the pars vaga of the eighth pair, the great sympathetic, and the intercostal nerves. Of the Phrenic Nerve. The phrenic nerve is formed by the union of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. Kruger * has observed, that two branches of the fourth cervical nerve go to form the phrenic nerve. This nerve descends along the fore-part of the anterior Vide bis Dissertation on the Phrenic Nerve.

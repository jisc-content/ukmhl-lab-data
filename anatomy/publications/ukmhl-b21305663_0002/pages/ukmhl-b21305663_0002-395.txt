OF THE DURA MATER. 349 »n oval shape, about two inches long, through which a pro- cess of the brain passed. In another instance, the falx was wanting *. In the lower animals, the length and breadth of the falx are much less than in man. In many animals the falx is osseous, as in birds. The dura mater is supplied with blood from the external and internal carotid arteries, and also from the vertebral ar- teries. But we cannot trace nerves along it, or into its sub- stance. Upon the upper surface of the dura mater, in the vicinity of the superior longitudinal sinus, there are small bodies, which, generally speaking, are about the size of pins’ heads, which vary much in size and situation in different individuals. These have been described by Pacchioni as being glandu~ for, by others as forming a part of the absorbent system; but it has not been ascertained that they are glandular, or that they constitute a part of the absorbent system, for we are completely in the dark as to their nature. The tentorium cerebello-superextensum, or tranverse mid- dle septum, on which the posterior lobes of the brain rest, and which separates these from the cerebellum, is fixed to the grooves and transverse i-idges of the os occipitis, to the ridges of the partes petrosae of the temporal bones, and to the pos- terior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. Between the transverse septum and posterior clinoid pro- cesses, there is an oval-shaped aperture, where the cerebrum and cerebellum are united. The falx and the tentorium cerebello-superextensum, and the connected and continuous processes of the dura mater, mutually support each other, and prevent the one hemisphere of the brain and the back part of the brain from gravitating on the cerebellum. The falx minor of the cerebellum is fixed to the middle perpendicular ridge of the occipital bone* and terminates at the edge of the foramen magnum ossis occipitis. * Vide Blbmbnbach’s Comp.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 288 placed, being firmly bound down by cellular substance: it cannot, therefore, be injured in that kind of crural hernia, in which the displaced bowels are lodged within the sheath of the lymphatic vessels, by dividing that part of the crural arch next the pubes, in the manner recommended by Mr Gimbernat. On the other hand, it frequently happens, when the obtura- tor arises in common with the epigastric artery, that a third branch, nearly of equal size with the obturator, takes its rise from the common trunk. This may be called the artery of the internal part of the crural arch ; for it runs on the inner side of the crural arch, passes across Gimbernat’s Ligament, and, when it reaches the symphysis pubis, divides into a number of small branches which are distributed upon the in- ner side of the symphysis pubis. When the trunk common to the obturator and epigastric arteries is an inch, or an inch and a half, in length, the ob- turator artery is situated between the symphysis pubis and the hernial sac, and sometimes follows the same course as that part of the crural arch called Gimbernat’s Ligament, of which arterial distribution I have seen several examples. Mr James Wardrop, was, I believe, the first who des- cribed such a distribution of arteries in the case of crural her- nia. In the instance alluded to, the obturator artery arose from the same trunk as the epigastric artery; then passed on the pubal side of the neck of the hernial sac, and described a semicircle around the neck of the sac. There is little risk of wounding the obturator artery, ex- cepting when the trunk common to it and the epigastric, is an inch long, and when it follows the course of Gimber- nat’s ligament: hence that unusual deviation of the obtu- rator artery from its ordinary course, does not form so strong an objection to Gimbernat’s operation for crural hernia as has been stated. There is still another variety as to the distribution of the epigastric and obturator arteries. These arteries in some cases come oil’ from the anterior iliac artery by separate trunks; and the obturator artery passes around that part of the cm-

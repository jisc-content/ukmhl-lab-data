OF THE POSTEllIOlt FIEAItT. 39 with each other, but are separated by a partition, which is thicker towards the basis than at the apex of the heart. This muscular partition receives fibres, from both ventricles of the heart; but the greater number are derived from the posterior ventricle. Of'the Aorta. From the posterior ventricle the large artery of the body issues, called Aorta ; the connection of which with the ventri- cle, has been accurately described by Baron Haller. â€œ Caro cordis in circuli perfecti formam terminatur, et fi- bra? transversae cordis, partim inter valvulas arteriosas per lineae longitudinem producuntur, et aliquanto plus, partim in par- tem arteriae, quae sinum valvulosuin perfecit, pariter sursum pergunt, fere per sesquilineam, et accurate transversae cum al- ba pariter membrana arteriae connectuntur, cellulosae brevis telae ope, ut nulla cordis fibram arteriam continuetur The orifice of the aorta is separated from the opening into the auricle by a portion of the mitral valve; so that when the parts of the mitral valve are pressed together, so as to oppose the reflux of the blood into the auricle, the passage from the ventricle into the aorta becomes wider. Of Communications between the opposite Cavities of the Heart. There is an aperture in the partition between the auricles of the heart of the foetus, through which a considerable part of the blood passes from the anterior into the posterior auricle. This passage of communication sometimes remains open for years, by which the usual quantity of blood does not circulate through the lungs, in consequence of which it is imperfectly oxidated. This unusual structure is generally characterised bv the purple colour and coldness of the skin, by fits of difficult breathing, by impaired digestion, and occasional syncope. But there are some exceptions to the above observation. One of them fell under my own notice, and the following were the appearances on dissection. Hadleri Element. Physiol, lib. iv.

OF THE NERVES. 831 been cut out, and the divided extremities of the nerves turned a wav from each other ; but this also does not invariably suc- ceed, even though an inch of the nerve be removed. I have lately had an opportunity of examining the metacarpal nerves of a horse, after portions had been cut out to remove lame- ness, and found a restoration of an inch of the nerve, the place of the whole nerve having been supplied. From what I have observed, it seems to me, that when such disordered sensations occur, there is an increased local action of the bloodvessels distributed on the nerve or nerves. I have often, in cases of tic douloureux, remarked the violent pul- sation of the angular, labial, and nasal arteries, and have ob- served the pain removed by the affusion of cold water, the applicacation of leeches, of a blister, or by an attack of ery- sipelas of the face. The above opinion also seems probable, from the circum- stance, that, after the recovery of the sensibility, which there is reason to conclude proceeds from a reunion of the divided nerve, there is sometimes a morbid sensibility left in the part supplied by the nerve that has been divided,â€”an opinion of which the following case affords an illustration : A gentleman, by a pen-knife, accidentally divided the little finger transversely, and down to the bone. At the time of the injury, the point of the finger was rendered almost insensible ; but, after some time, it acquired a morbid sensibility, so that he could not suffer it to be touched even slightly ; and, what is striking, this morbid sensibility of the finger has continued for years. From what has been stated as to the mode in which more painful sensations are propagated in the disease called Tic Douloureux, the reader may be disposed to think that these sensations are propagated not only alonw the nerve more immediately affected, but also along the nerves with w hich it communicates; yet there have been instances pub- lished, which are adverse to such an opinion. It yet remains to be determined, whether the nerves com- municate their influence to other nerves, the communications of which with the brain have been cut off. The case related by Mr Ea.rle shews, that the sensation is not communicated

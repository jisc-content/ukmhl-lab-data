274 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. a certain peculiarity of constitution. I am fully persuaded, that there is greater risk in examining a body a day or two after death, than after a week or two; and also, that much may be done to avert those consequences sometimes resulting from a puncture, by immediately washing the part with soap and ji water, and by the application of the nitrate of silver, or of a drop or two of nitric acid. SECTION III. OF THE THORACIC AORTA. The thoracic aorta descends on the left side of the verte- bras of the back, behind the lungs, and within the mediasti- num posterius ; it follows nearly a straight course ; and when it approaches the diaphragm, it lies more in front of the ver- tebrae. From the thoracic aorta, several branches are derived, before it reaches the abdomen, besides those which have been already described. Murray has made mention of a small branch which takes its rise from the concave part of the arch of the aorta, which he calls the Superior and Posterior Pericardiac Artery; this small artery frequently takes its origin from the subclavian or internal mammary artery. The arteries called Bronchial, as they are distributed upon the bronchi or lungs, take their rise from the upper part of the descending aorta. The number and size of the bronchial arteries, are various in different subjects. These bronchial arteries have been divided into two classes, the Right and Left. The right bronchial arteries are distributed upon the> right lungs, the bronchial lymphatic glands, and the inner mem- >r branes of the larger branches of the windpipe and pleura. The right bronchial arteries are sometimes derived from the superior intercostal artery. The left bronchial arteries, which are unequal in size, take their rise from the fore-part of the aorta; they are subdivided - into many small branches, which are distributed through the rf the substance of the lungs, along the coats of the pulmonary

OF THE CORONARY ARTERIES. 235 jvisses upwards, in the direction of the axis of the heart, to the right side, as high as the cartilage of the second rib, and then is directed backwards, almost horizontally, to the left side; thus forming what has been called the arch of that ar- tery > which terminates opposite to the third dorsal vertebra, on the left side of the body. The relative situation of the aorta, in respect to the neigh- bouring parts, merits attention, as tending to explain the ef- fects and consequences of aneurism of certain parts of that great artery. lsÂ£, That part of the aorta which is contained within the pericardium sometimes bursts *. 2d, The uppermost part of the arch of the aorta presses upon the cartilages of the second and third ribs of the right side, and on the uppermost portion of the breast-bone, and sometimes occasions their absorption; thus the tumour, which was originally internal, becomes external. A very large aneu- rism of the aorta ascends into the neck, considerably above the collar-bone. 3d, The aorta, when enlarged, presses much upon the left branch of the vnndpipe, creating constant cough, difficult breathing, and great oppression, and, by the blood from it bursting into that tube, proves fatal. 4th, Or the enlarged aorta bursts into the left pleura or gullet. 5th, If the aneurism of the aorta be seated near to the ver- tebrae of the back, the patient suffers acute pain in the back, and often palsy in the limbs ; and, after death, one or more of the vertebrae are found carious; and sometimes the tumour protrudes at the side of the spine. 6th, The enlarged aorta, pressing upon the vena innomi- nata, explains the cause of the purple colour of the counte- nance of persons afflicted by that disease. Of the Coronary Arteries. These two arteries take their rise immediately behind the Vide Plate II.

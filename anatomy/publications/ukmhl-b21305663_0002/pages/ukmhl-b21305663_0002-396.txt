ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 350 The superior longitudinal sinus, Imbedded between the layers of the dura mater, takes its rise at the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, runs along the upper part of the falci- form process of the dura mater, becoming gradually larger as it approaches the back part of the head, and divides, opposite to the most prominent part of the os occipitis, into two lateral branches or sinuses. The smaller veins of the brain open into the superior lon- gitudinal sinus, at its upper and back part, and their orifices are chiefly directed obliquely forwards. The right and left branches of the superior longitudinal si- nus, called the lateral sinuses, which are imbedded in the grooves of the occipital, parietal, and temporal bones, follow a tortuous course, and at length terminate in the internal ju- gular vein. The fourth sinus, or torcular herophili, is a short canal, situated at the junction of the falx and tentorium, which it passes, downwards and backwards, and joins the la- teral sinuses. The inferior longitudinal sinus, lodged in the under part of the falx, is very small, when compared with the upper, and is sometimes awanting. There are also various sinuses, situated at the base of the skull, which have been named, from their situation or form. These are the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses; the former is situated upon the ridges of the partes petrosa?, and the latter at the roots of the partes petrosa; of the tem- poral and the occipital bones. The sphenoidal sinuses are placed at the sides of the sella turcica. The circular sinus of Ridley surrounds the pituitary gland; it is of a small size, and receives the veins of the dura mater which are in the vicinity of it. The cavernous sinuses begin at the anterior clinoid processes, and extend backwards, in a horizontal direction, at the sides of the sella turcica, and terminate in the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses.

29 CAMP COOKERY. SHELL-FISH. Clam-bake. For a Party of from ten to twenty Per- sons.—First, make an oven of flat stones placed together in the form of a square, on a flat surface about two and a half feet square; around the edge of these, place other stones to form a bin. Fill this oven with small kindlings, such as can be gathered on the beach. On these, pile a few armfuls of larger sticks, crosswise, so that the top can be well covered with stones about the size of one’s two hands. Start the fire, and allow it to burn down until the stones, which were on top of the wood, settle into the oven. Clean out all the cinders with a poker or stick ; for, if al- lowed to remain, the smoke from them will spoil the bake. This must be done very quickly, that the oven may not cool

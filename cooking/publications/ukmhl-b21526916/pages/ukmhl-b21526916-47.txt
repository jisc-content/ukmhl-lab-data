Serve the same vegetables as for broiled steak Broiled Beef Steak. Cut the steak about three quarters of an inch thick. Dave a clear fire and lay the steak on the gridiron, and dredge lightly with flour. If you desire the steak rare, cook ten minutes , if well done, fifteen. Dish and season with butter, pepper, and salt. Serve immediately. Never set steak into the oven to keep warm or to melt the butter. The dish must bo hot, the butter stand in a warm room long enough to soften, but do not melt. If for dinner, servo po- tatoes, either baked or boiled, and any other vegetables which you choose. Many per- sons pound tough steak before cooking, but I would not recommend it, as by this means it loses much of its juiciness.

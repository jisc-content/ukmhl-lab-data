CAMP COOKKRY. 59 remains from one dinner can be used for the next, by preparing it in the following manner: Butter a shallow dish, and turn the macaroni into it ; then grate over it old cheese, and brown. Boiled Green Corn. Boil twenty-five minutes, if very young and tender. As it grows older it requires a longer time. Send to the table in a nap- kin. Boiled Turnips. Peel and cut into slices. If they are to be served in slices, boil with a small piece of pork. Boil the pork three hours, and put in the turnips; if they arc the white turnip, they will cook in forty-five minutes; but if the yellow, they will require two hours. Serve in slices without any season- ing except what they get by being boiled with the pork.

63 CAMP COOKERY. quire two things to make them perfect; that is, plenty of water when first put on to boil, and a long time to boil. Have about two quarts of boiling water in a large stewpan, and into it stir one cup of oatmeal, which you have already wet with cold water ; boil this an hour, stirring often, and then add half a spoonful of salt, and boil an hour longer. If it should get too stiff, add more boiling water ; or, if too thin, boil a little longer. You cannot boil it too much. The only trouble there is in cooking oat- meal is, that it takes a long time ; and surely no one will let that stand in the way when it is so much better for having the extra time. It is also very necessary that there be an abundance of water to begin with ; if not, it will never be as good, no matter how much may be added after it has been cooking any time. Hominy.

CAMP COOKERY. 46 salt. This is the most unsavory method of cooking veal, and I would not recom- mend it. Fricassee of Veal. Fry eight slices of salt pork, brown. Take out the pork, and put in thin slices of veal, which have been cut from the leg. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fry brown. When all the veal is fried, mix with the boiling fat two tablespoonfuls of dry flour ; stir until there are no lumps, and the flour is brown ; then add two cups of boiling water, and season with salt and pepper. Lay the veal in this gravy, and simmer fifteen minutes. Dish, and pour the gravy over the meat. If for dinner, garnish with boiled rice, and serve plain boiled potatoes. Mutton Chops. Cut the chops from the loin or the neck ; broil as you do beefsteak, and serve in hot dishes.

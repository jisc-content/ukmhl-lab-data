CAMP COOKERY. 23 and wash clean; broil over clear coals ten minutes, then dip in boiling water, butter, and serve. This is a nice relish for break' fast or tea, and with boiled potatoes makes an excellent dinner.. Broiled Mackerel. Split down the back, and clean. Be care- ful to scrape all the thin black skin from the inside. Wipe dry, and lay on the gridiron; broil on one side a nice brown, then turn, and brown the other side ; it will not take so long to brown the side on which the skin is. (All fish should have the side on which the skin is, turned to the fiiâ€™e last, as the skin burns easily, and coals are not so hot after you have used them ten minutes.) Season with butter, pepper, and salt. Fried Mackerel. Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork. Prepare your mackerel as for broiling. Take out your pork, sprinkle a little salt over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown. Serve the fried pork with it.

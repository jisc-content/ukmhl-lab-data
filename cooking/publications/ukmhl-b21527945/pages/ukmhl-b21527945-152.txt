CAPERS to pickle. — The tree that bears capers is called the caper shrub or bush, of which they are the flower-buds. They ure common in the western parts of Europe, and we have them in some of our gardens; but Toulon is the principal place for them. Some are sent us from Lyons, but they are flatter, and not so firm. Some come from Majorca, but they are salt and disagreeable. They gather the buds from the blossoms before they open, then spread them upon the floor of a room where no sun enters, and there let them lie till they begin to wither. They then throw them into a tub of sharp vinegar, and after three days, they add a quantity of hay salt. When this is dissolved, they are fit for packing, and are sent to all parts of Europe. The finest capers are those of a moderate size, firm, and close, and such as have the pickle highly flavoured. Those which are soft, flabby, and half open, are of little value.

Lamb (Epigramme of).*—Take the fore- quarter of a lamb, take off the shoulder, and cut the neck so that the cutlets are not injured ; dress it (the neck) in the same manner as shoulder of lamb with cucumbers (see that article), and when done, press it between two dishes to make it smooth; let it cool, and then cut it into pieces rather larger than the cutlets; make them of the same size and shape, (oval,) rub them all over with a sauce a I’atelet, dip them in melted butter; bread, and lay them on a dish; cut, and trim the cutlets, season them with salt and pepper, and put them in a pan with melted butter over them: take the shoulder (which has been roasted), cut off all the meat, mince, and make it into a blanquette; keep it hot in the bain-marie. Just before dinner time, broil the pieces of the neck, fry and glaze the cutlets, lay them al- ternately on a dish, en couronne, in the centre of which pour the blanquette, and serve the whole immediately.

Cut some pieces of paper, each large enough to hold one of the feet; rub all over the in- side, lay the feet on pieces of oiled paper, with the herbs put round and in the hollow parts, wrap each in a thin piece of bacon, over which fold the paper so as to enclose them completely; broil them thus over a slow but clear fire for half an hour.

Always keep the grapes under the pickle. Grams (Preserved) in Clusters.—Take the large Gascoigne grapes before they are too ripe, and prick every one : to every pound of grapes put a pound and a quarter of sugar ; make a syrup of the verjuice, strained; when the sugar is quite clear, put the grapes (after they are strained into syrup) into a deep jar, cover them close, and set them in a pot of scalding water over the fire to boil; as soon as the grapes are tender, take them up, and boil the syrup a little more ; when they are half cold, put them into broad glasses or straight jars ; lay one cluster over the other, cover them with brandy paper, and tie them up. Grapes (Bell) to preserve in Jelly.—Take the long, large, bell grapes, pick off the stalks, stone them, and put them into boil- ing water; scald them thoroughly; take them from the fire, and cover them close to prevent the steam from escaping; then set them over a very gentle fire for two or three hours (but do not let them boil) ; take them out, and put them into clarified sugar, more than will cover them, and give them a good boil; skim them ; boil a little more sugar to a strong souffle, take as much plum jelly as sugar, and give it a boil; then put the grapes to it; let them all boil together, skim them well, and put them into pots or glasses. Grapes (Green) to preserve.—Take the largest and best grapes before they are ripe, stone and scald them; let them lav two days in the water they were scaldeil in, then drain them, and put them into a tlijn syrup ; heat them over a small fire ; the next day turn the grapes into a pan, and heat them the day after; then drain them, put them into clarified sugar, give them a good boil, skim them, and set them by; the next day boil more sugarto souffle, put it to the grapes, give them all a good boil, skim them, and set them in a warm stove all night; the dayj after, drain the grapes, and lay them out to dry, first dust- ing them very well. Grapes (llatajia of).*—Take some fine muscadine grapes, pick them from the stalks ; bruise and press them, so as to ex- tract all their juice; then dissolve some sugar in the grape juice, adding to it brandy and cinnamon; let the whole in- fuse for a fortnight; then strain it through a filtering-bag, and bottle it off. The pro- per proportions are, one pint of brandy and ten ounces of sugar to one pint of grape juice. Grape Tart.—Make choice of the youngest grapes before the stone is formed ; pick and scald them the same as currants or gooseberries, and finish the same as for all other tarts, only adding more sugar or\ account of their tartness. Grape Wine.—To one gallon of grapes put one gallon of water ; bruise the grapes; let them stand a week without stirring; then draw it off, and fine ; put to a gallon of the wine three pounds of sugar; and then put it in a vessel, but it must not be stopped till it has done hissing. Grapes (Conserve of Muscadine).—Grain a pound of muscadine grapes, boil them a moment, and sift them through a sieve ; reduce the juice over the fire to a quarter part of what was sifted ; put to it one pound of sugar prepared to the twelfth degree (au casse) and let it boil a little; then work it well together till itbegins to grow white, warm the whole a moment, then pour it into paper cases made for the purpose ; when it is cool, cut it into cakes of what size you please. Grapes (Paste of Muscadine).—This paste is made the same as sour grapes, only that the grapes must not be bruised. Grapes (Clear Paste of Muscadine).— Boil about a pound of muscadine grapes with a glass of water ; boil also two com- mon baking apples to a marmalade; sift them together first in a sieve, then in a linen cloth ; refine a pound of sugar to the twelfth degree (au casse), and pour the liquid gently into it, constantly stirring it over a slow fire ; it is come to perfection when it leaves the spoon, being turned over like a jelly, and must then be dried in a stove the same as all others ; these trans- parent pastes are cut out for use to what, size and shape vou please ; and so on of other kinds of fruit.

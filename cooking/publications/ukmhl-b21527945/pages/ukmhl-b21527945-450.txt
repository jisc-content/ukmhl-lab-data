Serve it either hot or cold. Pie (Raised) to be served Hot.—Make a stiff paste, as directed for liaised Pies, which mix with warm water; when tho- roughly well mixed and blended together, roll it out tolerably thin ; cut a piece out for the bottom, and one for tbe sides, ac- cording to the shape of the dish, egg the edges of the parts you intend to join, and press them well together, so that the join- ing may not be perceptible ; shape it, gar- nish it with leaves or festoons, according to your own taste, fill it nearly to the top with bran, egg it, and let it be baked in a moderate oven ; when done of a fine light colour turn out the bran, and set it ready for what you intend to put in, which may be either cutlets of mutton stewed with vegetables, partridges farced with a brown sauce, chicken cut up with a ragout in a brown sauce, stewed carp, or eels, &c. Pie ( Hot Raised ) Anglo-Frangais. * —• Take the fillets from four loins of mutton, trim and cut them into scollops, which season well with salt, pepper, and nutmeg ; dissolve slowly three quarters of a pound of butter, and the instant it becomes liquid put into it two spoonsful of parsley, four of mushrooms, the same of truffles (all shred fine), and a shalot blanched and shred also. Make a raised crust of whatever form and size you please, and having soaked the fillets in the butter and herbs, lay them on the pie, cn couronne; fill up the centre with mushrooms, minced truffles, artichoke bottoms, veal or lamb sweetbreads; pour the remainder of the butter and herbs over; cover them with two bay leafs, slices of bacon, and the lid of the pie; decorate the walls or sides tastefully, dorez and set it in a brisk oven; when you find the top is sufficiently coloured, cut it off and lay in its place three or four sheets of pnper, and replace the pie in the oven ; an hour and a half is the time it will re- quire to bake properly; as soon as it is done, take out the bay leaves and bacon, and pour in a demi-glaze of mutton mixed with an essence of truffles and mushrooms and the juice of a lemon; glaze the crust, and serve it quite hot. Pie (Hot Raised) a la Financiere*— Make a raised crust of any form you may think proper; line the inside with thin slices of bacon, and fill up with beef suet chopped small; decorate the exterior of the pie according to your fancy, dorez and put it into a brisk oven for an hour ; then take it out, and when it is a little cooled, take out all the contents, half fill it with a fowl or game quenelle, and finish it with a ragoiit of lamb sweet breads, cock’s combs, and kidneys, mushrooms, truffles, arti- choke bottoms, six Cray fish, and as manv Cray fish tails ; pour in some good espag- nole, worked up with a fowl consomme, fla- voured with truffles, some Rhenish or dry Madeira wine.

Take sixteen eggs, separate the yolks and whites, beat the former well, and whisk the latter till nearly firm ; then mix the yolks with the rice (talcing oft' the the ashes) ; the preparation ought to be of the same consistence as a cream pdtis~ siere; add, at first, a quarter, and after- wards the whole of the whites; stir them in as lightly as for biscuit paste ; the whole being thoroughly amalgamated, pour it into the croustade, and place it in a mo- derate oven for one hour and a half; when done, cover a baking-tin with red cinders, on which place the souffle the moment it is taken out of the oven; this prevents its falling, whilst you mask it with powder sugar, and glaze with the salamander; carry it into the dining-room on the tin, have a dish ready with a napkin folded on it; place the souffle on the dish, and let it be served immediately.

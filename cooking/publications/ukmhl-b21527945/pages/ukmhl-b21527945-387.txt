MUSHROOMS (to choose.)—The mush- rooms proper to be used in cookery grow in the open pasture land, for those that grow near or under trees are poisonous. The eatable mushrooms first appear very small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow very rapidly, and the upper part and stalk are white. As they increase in size, the under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very fine salmon-colour, which continues more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edge and middle, and. whether they have a pleasant smell. Those which are poisonous have a yellow skin, and the under part has not the clear flesh colour of the real mushroom; besides which, they smell rank and disagreeable, and the fur is white or yellow. Mushrooms a la Bourgeois.*—Pick, trim, and cut the mushrooms in halves ; put some slices of streaky bacon into a stew- pan, and set it on a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, then add the mushrooms, parsley, scallions, shalots (chopped), pep- per, a pinch of flour, a little stock and white wine ; stew the whole gently, and when reduced to a thick sauce, pour it on fried bread, and serve with vinegar or lemon juice. Mushrooms (Broiled).— Choose the largest sort; pepper and salt them well, put butter on, lay them on a small grid- iron with the stalk upwards, broil them rather quick, and serve them with good gravy. Mushrooms ere Cannellon.—Chop some mushrooms into dice, put them into a stewpan, with sliced parsley, scallions, shalots, and some butter; when a little browned, add stock, pepper, and salt; let it simmer till the mushrooms are done, and the sauce pretty thick, then put in the yolks of three eggs, and a little lemon juice; set it by to cool; in the mean time roll some paste very thin, cut it in pieces, in each of which put some of the above, moisten the edges, and roll them up into the form of short sausages, flour and fry them.

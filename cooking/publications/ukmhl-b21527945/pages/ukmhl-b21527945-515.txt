481 SPI SPI set it on a stove, skim it, and as soon as it boils, set it on one side, and let it simmer for two hours very gently ; take the crumb of a couple of French rolls, and cut it into round pieces, which brown in the oven, and put them into the tureen, and pour the soup upon them. If you think proper, it may be clarified, the same as other clear soups ; but the real Soup de Sante ought not to be clarified. Soup (White) without Meat. — Put two or three quarts of water into a saucepan, with the crumb of a small loaf, abundleof sweet herbs, whole pepper, a few cloves, an onion or two cut across, and a little salt; cover close and boil till perfectly smooth ; cut into small pieces some celery, endive, and lettuce, the white parts only; boil them, strain off the soup into a clean stew- pan ; put in the herbs, with a good piece of butter, keep stirring till it is melted; then let it boil till quite smooth ; skim it, soak some French roll, nicely rasped, in a little of the soup ; put it in a tureen, pour the remainder of the soup over, and send to table. SPICED Bread (Common).*—Boil three pounds of honey in a gallon of water for a quarter of an hour; then pour it on the flour in the trough; mix them together well, until the flour will imbibe no more liquid; when a little cooled, add three ounces of potash, infused the night before in half apint of milk, knead the whole well, putting to it some pounded anise. Roll out the paste, and with paste-cutters of various forms, cut it into little figures, lay them on a well-oiled tin, and bake them ; when done, wash them over with milk. With this paste spiced nuts are made ; when formed, lay them on this, and leave in a warm place for two or three hours be- fore they are baked. Spiced Bread (Dutch or Flemish).* — The evening before you wish to make your spiced bread, dissolve three ounces of white potash in half a pint of milk, and set it aside. The next morning put a consider- able quantity of sifted flour into a trough, make a hole in the heap, into which poui- six pounds of clarified honey ; whilst boil- ing, stir it well with a strong spatula, until the honey, reduced to a firm paste, will imbibe no more flour, then spread it all over the bottom of the trough, and leave it for about ten or fifteen minutes; at the end of that time, if the paste be sufficiently cool for you to bear your hand on it, rub its surface with the infusion of potash; then let a strong person knead it, in the same manner as the baker’s knead bread. Have ready a number of different-sized moulds of pear-tree wood, on which are cut (pretty deep) octagons of various dimen- sions ; then cut your paste into as many pieces as you have moulds, in the follow- ing proportions : For the mould containing a pound, take eighteen ounces of paste, for a half-pound, fourteen ounces ; a quarter of a pound seven ounces of paste, and so on ; knead each piece separately on the slab, rub them with flour to prevent their adhering, and then put them into the re- spective moulds ; press them down tight; in a minute or two turn them over, place them on a tin plate (previously rubbed with olive oil), and with a soft brush take off what flour may remain on the surface of the spiced bread, and bake them in a mo- derate oven. Whilst they are baking, dis- solve some isinglass in a sufficient quantity of beer, with which, by means of a hair pencil, wash the outside of the spiced bread as soon as it is done ; and then, while it is moist and warm, decorate it with blanched almonds, candied lemon and orange peel, cut into dice. You may, if you think proper, cut these sorts of sweet- meats into very small pieces, and knead them into your paste at first. When they are nearly cold, separate the pieces with a knife. Spiced Bread (Dutch), rich.* — Make your paste in the same manner as above, and when kneaded with the potash, add a quarter of a pound of anise, two ounces of coriander, two ounces of cinnamon, one ounce of cloves (all reduced to an impal- pable powder), a pound of candied lemon peel, the same of candied orange peel, both cut into thin slices ; mix these ingredients thoroughly with the paste, and then cut it into pieces, each weighing twenty-eight ounces : these, when baked, will not ex- ceed a pound in weight; spread them on your slab, and form them into squares two or three inches in thickness; place them side by side, on a baking-tin, previously rubbed with oil of almonds, and put round the tin some slips of wood to prevent the spiced bread from getting thinner at the edges ; dip a brush in some milk, and rub the surface of the spiced bread with it; put them into a moderate oven until well risen and of a brownish colour. Whilst they are baking, blanch a few almonds and split them, cut some candied lemon and orange peel into very thin slices, and as soon as the spiced bread is taken from the oven wash it over with a decoction of isin-

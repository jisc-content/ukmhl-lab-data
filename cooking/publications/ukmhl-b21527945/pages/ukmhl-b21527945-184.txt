Cherries (Massepain of).—Take the stones from half a pound of ripe cherries, bruise the fruit, and then add to it a pound of sugar, and the same of pounded sweet almonds; put them on the fire, and work them till quite dry.

Cherries preserved dry in Bunches*— Ice up some fine equal-sized cherries in bunches, seven or eight in each, fasten them by the ends of the stalks, throw them into sugar boiled to soujjld. Let the cher- ries boil up in it fourteen or fifteen times, then skim and pour it into an earthen pan, set it in a stove till the next day, when drain and lay out the cherries to dry.

Other fruit may be added. Some boil fruit puddings in a cloth without a basin. Another way.*-—Make a plain batter pudding-, and stir in picked cherries and sugar, taking care not to break them.

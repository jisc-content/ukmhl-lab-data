Neat’s Tongue Roasted d la Fran^aise. ■ Boil a neat’s tongue, and blanch it; set it by till it is cold, then cut a hole in the under part, and take out the meat, mince it with two or three hard eggs, an apple, beef suet, and bacon; season with salt, beaten ginger, and sweet herbs, shred very fine; stuff the tongue with this forcemeat; then cover the end with a veal caul, lard it with bacon, and roast it; serve with a sauce made of gravy, butter, and the juice of oranges, garnish the dish with sliced lemon peel and barberries.' Neat’s Tongue, with Truffles.—Boil a pickled neat’s tongue two hours ; take off the skin, let it remain cool ; then cut a large incision in the under part, and fill it with light forcemeat, with some green truffles pounded in it, sew it up, trim it neatly, rub it over with yolk of egg, and cover it with paste made with beef marrow, instead of butter; afterwards wash the paste over with white of egg, ornament it in the same manner as a raised pie, with the remaining part of the paste, then bake it till tender in a moderately heated oven, and serve it up with truffle sauce under, or it may be served with stewed spinach or turnips.

Nectarine Ice.—Use either marmalade or jelly (which is made the same as peach or apricot jelly), or, if when nectarines are in season, cut seven or eight of them when quite ripe, bruise them, boil them in a pint of water; then sift them; put a suffi- cient quantity of sugar to the sifted juice ; and finish the same as all others. Nectarines (to keep).*—This fruit is bottled in a similar manner to apricots ; the nectarines should be gathered perfectly ripe, and the skin taken off with great care. Nectarines (to preserve).—Split the nectarines, and take out the stones, then put them into clarified sugar; boil them till they have thoroughly taken the sugar, take off all the scum, cover them with a paper, and set them by ; the following day boil a little more sugar to a strong souffle, put it to the nectarines, and give them a good boil; take off the scum, cover them, and put them into the stove; the next day drain them, and lay them out to dry, having previously dusted them a little with sugar, then put them into the stove again. Nectarines (Liquid Sweetmeat of).— The nectarines should be almost ripe ; peel and cut them in halves, simmer them in boiling water till they rise on the sur- face, and then drain them ; boil them in clarified sugar till there is no longer any scum rises, and leave them therein till the next day; then drain them, and boil the sugar to the seventh degree, add the fruit to it to boil a moment, and repeat the same again the following day ; let the fruit and sugar incorporate together for a couple of days, before you put them into pots, and keep the pan in a warm place ; the propor- tion of fruit and sugar in equal quantities.

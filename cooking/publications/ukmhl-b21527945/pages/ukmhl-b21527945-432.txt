PAR 398 PAR birds may have the form of an oval well; cut the meat off tho breasts, two or three truffles, and a score of small mushrooms into dice, mix them together; take six ladiesful of espagnole, the same offumet of game ; reduce them to a third, and strain them over the mince ; heat your partridges in the bain-marie; place the birds in a dish, pour the ragout into them, and serve with espagnole travaillee. Partridges en Pain.*'—'Take a nice shaped loaf, of about a pound weight; make a hole at one end, through which take out all the crumbs, rub the crust over with a little butter or lard, and set it in the oven for a few minutes to dry; fill this with minced partridge (see that article), and put the loaf, bottom upwards, into a stewpan; add two spoonsful of veal blond, with any other garnish you please ; let it remain on the fire till the bread is soft enough to allow a straw to penetrate it, then take it out and dish it with the sauce round. Partridge aux Papillotes.*—Cut a good sized partridge completely in half, from the neck to the rump; put some butter into a pan, and do up the two pieces in it over the fire; in about eight or ten minutes take them out, cover with herbs en papil- lotes, and let them stand to cool; then take a square piece of paper, large enough to hold the half bird, rub it over with oil, lay a thin slice of bacon on it, then the bird, with the herbs, another thin slice of bacon, and fold the paper over the whole, and broil them slowly on a moderate fire. Serve them with a clear gravy. Partridge Pie in a Dish.—Take four partridges, pick and singe them ; cut off their legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mush- rooms. Put a veal steak and a slice of ham at the bottom of the dish ; put in the par- tridges with half a pint of good consommd. Line the edges of the dish with puff-paste, and cover with the same ; do it over with egg, and let it bake for an hour. Partridges (Standing Pie of) Chaude- froid.*'—Make about six pounds of raised paste, which wrap in a damp cloth, and sot it aside. Take five partridges, pick and bone them; weigh the meat, and to each pound put a quarter of an ounce of spiced salt; cut the meat from two wild rabbits, of which take a pound and a half, mince this with two pounds and a quarter of fat bacon, then put both these articles into a mortar, and pound them with eight drachms of spiced salt, two yolks, one whole egg, a shalot minced and blanched, a dessert spoonful of parsley, two of mush- rooms, twro of truffles (all well minced) ; rub this farce through a quenelle sieve, and mix it in a pan, with a pound of truffles cut into dice, and a table-spoonful of velouti or espagnole. Cut a pound of fat bacon into small lardons, which roll in four drachms of spiced salt, and two spoonsful of parsley, mushrooms, and truffles, all shred small; with some of these lard the partridges withinside, so that the lardons may not penetrate the skin; and with the remainder lard a noix of veal. Having thus prepared your ingredients, proceed as follows: Form three-fourths of your paste into a standing crust, eight inches in diameter, and eight in height, into which put about half the farce, spread it smoothly all over the bottom, to form a bed of four or five inches thick; lay open the partridges, strew half their proportion of spiced salt, put in each a spoonful of the farce, and form them into a kind of heart; prick the skins in two or three places with the point of a knife, and lay them on the pie, fill up the interstices with farce, and strew over the remaining portion of their spiced salt. Weigh the noix of veal, and accord- ing to its weight, take the spiced salt (four drachms to a pound), trim the noix as round as you can, place it on the partridges, fill up the space round it with farce; strew the seasoning over, and cover the whole with a pound of the best butter cut in pieces, and so placed as to form a kind of dome, and on these lay slices of bacon-and two bay leaves. Roll out the remainder of the paste for the top, making it eleven inches in diameter ; moisten the edges of the pie, and lay the cover on it, make a hole in the middle; dare: and place the pie in a brisk oven for about ten minutes, then take it out, and tie it in some paste- board cut for the purpose, and replace it for four hours; at the eiuf of that time take it out, put a piece of paste over the hole, and leave it to cool. When perfectly cold, cut off the lid carefully, take out the veal, and put in its place a salmi chaud- froid of partridges; lay these in order, pour the sauce over; replace the lid, and serve it on a folded napkin. These chaud-f'roid pies may be com- posed of all kinds of fowl, pheasants, wood- cocks, leverets, &c., according to your taste or convenience. Partridges Poilcs*—Take the entrails, liveTs, and gizzards, from three partridges (all tho same size), through the crop, very

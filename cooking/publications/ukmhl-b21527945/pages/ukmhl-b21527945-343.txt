309 JES JEL Jelly (Riband).—Boil four calf’s feet, without the great hones, in ten quarts of water, three ounces of hartshorn, three ounces of isinglass, a nutmeg- quartered, and four blades of mace; boil till it is reduced to two quarts ; strain it through a flannel bag, and when it has stood twenty-four hours, scrape off all the fat very clean, slice the jelly, add the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth, and boil the whole up, and strain it through a flannel bag. Then pour it into small high glasses, and run each colour as thick as a finger, each colour being thoroughly cold before another is poured on, which must be only lukewarm, or they will mix together. Red may be made with cochineal, green with spinach, yellow with saffron, blue with I syrup of violets, and white with thick cream : the plain jelly itself may be used as a colour. Jelly (Rubanee).* —■ Prepare nine yolks of eggs as directed for jelly of fro- ntage bavarois, but without the orange flower; when strained, add an ounce and half of clarified isinglass, and divide your preparation into four parts, in one of which | put an infusion of chocolate; to the second, i add an infusion of orange flowers ; to the I third some spinach juice and bitter maca- i roons crushed; and put to the fourth some blancmange. Place your mould in ice, as much of each of these portions alternately as will occupy an inch in depth; taking- care that every layer is set before you pour on another. Jelly (Russian).*■—Clarify three quar- ters of a pound of sugar, and two ounces of isinglass, put them together into an earthen pan, which place on ice ; add to it the juice of two lemons, and four small .glasses of kirschwasers ; then take a whisk and beat it up over the ice till it becomes as white as beaten egg; the moment it 1 .gets firm, put it into a mould, and finish the jelly in the usual way. Jelly (Savoury) to put over cold Pics.— It should he made either of a small bare knuckle, of leg, or shoulder, of veal, or a piece of scrag of mutton ; or, if the pie is made of fowl, or rabbits, the carcasses, necks, or heads, added to any piece of meat, will be sufficient, observing to give consistence by cowheel or shanks of mut- ton. Put the meat, with a slice of ham, or bacon, a bundle of different herbs, two blades of mace, an onion, or two, a small bit of lemon peel, and a tea-spoonful of Jamaica pepper bruised, and the same quantity of whole pepper, and three pints of water, into a stewpan that shuts very close. When it boils, skim it well, and let it simmer slowly till quite strong ; then strain it, and when cold, take off all the fat you possibly can with a spoon ; and then, to remove every particle of grease, lay a clean piece of cap or blotting-paper on it. If, -when it is cold, it is not clear, boil it a few minutes with the whites of two eggs (but do not add the sediment), and pour it through a nice sieve, with a napkin in it, which should he previously dipped in hot water, to prevent waste. Jelly (Savoury).—'Take all the scum off from the cold liquor that either poultry or meat has been braised in, or some veal stock, and make it warm; strain it through a sieve into a stewpan, and season it to the palate with salt, lemon pickle, Cayenne pepper, and tarragon or plain vinegar; add enough of dissolved isinglass to make it of a proper stiffness, whisk in plenty of whites of eggs, a small quantity of the yolks and shells, and just colour it; set it over the fire, and let it boil, then simmer it for a quarter of an hour, and run it through a jelly bag several times, till bright and fine. J elly ( Whipped).*—Make a jelly Prin- tanniere, and pour about a quarter of it into a mould, and ice it, as therein di- rected ; then take the mould, and place a basin in its stead, in which put the re- mainder of the jell}-, and whip it with a whisk, as you would eggs, over the jelly, until the globules are no bigger than pins’ heads; pour it into the mould, and replace it on the ice for three quarters of an hour, after which turn it out as usual. JESSAMINE (to candy).* — Boil a pound of clarified sugar to forte pcrlc, and when about half cold throw in two bands- ful of jessamine flowers, and place them on hot ashes for two hours, that the flowers may dry well; then drain them on a sieve from the sugar, and have ready some more, sifted, in which put the jessamine, rubbing them well with your hands; place them again on a sieve, and set them on a stove till next day ; after which sift the flowers ; take three pounds of clarified sugar, boil it to souffle, have a proper mould ready, pour the sugar into it, and put the flowers on it, push them down lightly with a fork, that they may be completely covered with the. sugar; place the mould in a moderate stove or oven for five days, then drain oft the syrup ; lay a sheet of paper on the table, and turn the candy quickly out of the mould.

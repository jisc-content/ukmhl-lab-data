Pigeons in Caul* — Take some very young pigeons, and having trussed them, split them down the back, and fill them with a good farce; lay a thin slice of bacon over each half, and wrap them in a piece of caul, previously soaked in warm water; bread them, and bake in a moderate oven. Pigeons a la Charmante.—Scald half a dozen small pigeons, and braise them with a few slices of bacon and lemon, a bundle of herbs, a proper quantity of stock, pepper and salt. In the mean time lard three or four sweetbreads, which stew slowly in a little broth, with some thin slices of veal, a bundle of herbs, two cloves, basil, and two or three scallions ; as soon as they are done, skim, strain, and reduce the liquor, and glaze the sweetbreads with it; then lay them on a dish alternately with the pigeons, over which pour a sauce made as follows : put a little consomme into the pan with the glaze, stir it round to gather what may adhere to the bottom and sides of the pan, then strain, and add more pepper and salt if requisite ; squeeze in a little lemon- juice. Take care none of the sauce goes on the sweetbreads, as it would spoil the look of the glaze.

Make a small macedoine with what vegetables mayremain from the above ; mix it with an allemande, and having reduced it, pour it over the birds, so that it will fill up all the interstices and cover the whole with cabbages or lettuces ; keep it hot in the bain-marie ; do not turn it out till the moment it should bo sent to table; drain off the water, nnd glaze it.

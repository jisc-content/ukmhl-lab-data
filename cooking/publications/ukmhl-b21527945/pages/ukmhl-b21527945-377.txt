MALLOWS (Syrup of).*—Take half a pound of mallows root, and having scraped and washed it well, cut it into small pieces, which set on the lire with three pints of water; when sufficiently boiled, the water will he glutinous, strain off' the decoction, and pour it into four pouftds of sug'ar; clarify it in the same manner as capillaire ; boil it to lisst, run it through a jelly-bag, and when cold, bottle it. MALT Vinegar.*—In Germany, this vinegar is made witli barley and wheat malt, of both of which there are two sorts, one dried in an oven or kiln, the other dried in the open air; of the latter the largest quantity is generally used. Put ten gallons of boiling water into a large tub, stir it till it cools a little ; then add your malt (two thirds barley, and one third wheat) a little at a time, stirring it with a stick until thoroughly mixed witli the water; cover the tub. Boil some more water, take the mash from the bottom of the large tub, put it into a smaller one, and place this within a larger one, so that there may be two inches space between the bottoms of each tub ; set another small tub on the top ; this latter should have boles pierced in it, through which pour the boiling water on the mash, beneath lay straw over, and leave it for an hour and a half; after that time, draw off the water by means of a cock placed between the two tubs ; then pour fresh boiling water over the malt, let it stand again, and repeat this operation as many times as you think necessary; the precise number must he regulatedaccording to the intended strength of die vinegar. Pour the liquor into casks, and when cold and settled, put it into a large barrel with a head to it; add some beer lees, cover and leave it for ten hours to ferment; as soon as it is clear, pour it into a cask, previously washed with strong vinegar, put to it some yeast; skim it well, and you will then have vinegar of the best quality. MARASCHINO* — Take sixteen pounds of fine sharp cherries, stone and take off the stalks; put them into five quarts of brandy to infuse, covered close for three days, then distil the infusion; distil also a pound of cherry leaves in six quarts of filtered river water, from which you will obtain about a gallon; dissolve in this four pounds and a half of fine sugar; add it to the liqueur, with two pints and a half of kirschenwasser, an ounce and four drachms of spirits of rose, the same of orange flowers, and three drachms of spirits of jessamine ; mix them altogether, run it through a jelly-bag, and bottle it; cork them well. Maraschino (Conserve of).*—Pound and sift some of the best lump sugar, mix it in a china basin with spirit of maras- chino, until it is of the consistence of pastil paste; then put it into a skillet over the fire, and beat it gently, stirring it con- stantly (but without letting it boil), till very liquid, when it may be poured into funnel-shaped tin moulds; put these moulds on iron plates, and dry the con- serve in a stove. Maraschino (Fromage Bavarnis):*—Boil a pint of double cream, to which add half a pound of sugar and six drachms of clari- fied isinglass ; run it through a sieve, and place it on ice; the moment it begins to congeal, pour in, by degrees, half a glass of maraschino; then stir in the whipped cream, and finish as usual. Maraschino Ice Cream* — Take two quarts of cream, twelve eggs, a pound of double-refined sugar, and three glasses of true maraschino; put the cream on to boil, and in the mean time whisk the whites of the eggs to a firm snow, then pour in eight yolks, and the sugar pounded and sifted, stir them together lightly, and then add by degrees the boiling cream, whipping continually; set it on the fire, and do not cease whipping until it has boiled up three or four times ; pour it through a sieve into a basin, stirring a little to enable it to run more freely; when cold put it into the sor- betiere with the maraschino; cover it in- stantly, and ice it as usual. Maraschino (Soufles Franfais of).*— Your preparation being made as usual (see SouJJles Franfais), when the whites of eggs are put in, add half a glass of ma- raschino. MARCHPANE.*—Take four pounds of sweet almonds, throw them into boil- ing water, let them lay till the skin loosens, then put them into cold water, after a few minutes blanch and throw them again into cold water to wasli them thoroughly. When dry, pound them (a handful at a time) to a very fine paste, moistening each handful witli two spoonsful of water ; the whole quantity of almonds being pounded, put

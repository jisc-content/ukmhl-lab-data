SAU SAU 469 roots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celery, also sliced ; put all these into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon ; cover it close and let it stand on hot ashes for sometime; then add equal quantities of white wine and good broth, place the stewpan in the bain-marie, and let the sauce simmer for four hours, when it may he strained for use. Be careful not to put in so much of any single ingredient, that its flavour may predominate over the others. Sauce (Brown).*—Take a pound or two of steaks, two or three pounds of veal, lean ham, some pickings of fowl, carrots, and onions, put all these into a saucepan with a glass of water, and set it on a brisk fire ; when scarcely any moisture remains, put it on a slow fire, that the jelly may take colour without burning; and as soon as it is brown, moisten it with stock (or water), add a bunch of parsley and green onions, two bay leaves, two cloves, and some champignons, salt it well, and set it on the fire for three hours, then strain; dilute a little roux with your liquor, and boil it an hour over a gentle fire, take off all the fat, and run it through a tammy. Sauce (Carrier).* — Scrape a small stick of horseradish, cut an onion or two in thin slices, put these into a sauce-tu- reen with a little vinegar and whole pep- per ; set the tureen in the dripping-pan under a shoulder of mutton whilst roast- ing; serve this sauce quite hot with the meat. Sauce a la Diable* — Mince half a dozen shalots very small, wash and press out all the moisture ; then put them into a saucepan with a glass of vinegar, a clove of garlic, a bay leaf, and some veal glaze, reduce it to nearly a jelly, moisten it with a little good gravy ; add pimento butter, and a spoonful of olive oil. Sauce (Grande).*—Take three or four slices from the under part of a knuckle of veal, and put them into a large stewpan with two ladiesful of consommd, set it on a fierce fire, taking care to skim it as much as possible, and with a cloth wipe away all that adheres to the inside of the stewpan ; when the consomme is reduced, prick the slices with a knife to let out the gravy; then set the stewpan on a slow fire, that the meat and glaze may adhere together, and as soon as the latter is of a clear light colour, take it off, leave it co- vered for ten minutes, then fill it up with rich stock, in which is four or five large carrots, and three onions ; let it boil slow- ly for two hours. In the mean time put the knuckle into a saucepan with four or Jive carrots, as many onions (one stuck with cloves), and two ladleslul of consom- me ; set it on a brisk fire that the liquor may reduce to a jelly, as soon as this jelly begins to take colour, pour on it the liquor from the other saucepan to dissolve the jelly gradually; then make it boil. Dilute some roux with the above liquor, and add it to the meat with some champignons, a bunch of parsley, scallions, and two bay leaves, skim it when it begins to boil, and again when the roux is added, put in more consomme or roux, according as it is too thick or too thin. When it has boiled an hour and a half, take off all the fat; and when the meat is quite done, strain the sauce through a bolting-cloth. Sauce a la Grimod*—Is the same as Sauce a la Portugaise, with the addition of grated nutmeg, two or three allspice bruised, and a little India saffron. Sauce (Harvey).—Chop twelve ancho- vies, bones and all, very small, with one ounce of Cayenne pepper, six spoonsful of soy, six ditto of good walnut pickle, three heads of garlic, chopped not very small, a quarter of an ounce of cochineal, two heads of shalots, chopped not very small, one gallon of vinegar; let it stand four- teen days, stir it well twice or thrice every day ; then pass it through a jelly- bag, and repeat this till it is perfectly clear; then bottle it, and tie a bladder over the cork. Sauce (Ilalienne).—Put some lemon parsley, thyme, and mushrooms, shred small, into a stewpan with a little butter and a clove of garlic ; set it on a moderate fire; as soon as the butter begins to fry, pour in a little consommd, and let it stew till pretty thick; then take out the garlic, add some butter sauce and a little lemon juice. Sauce (Italian) for Salads.—Mix to- gether three table-spoonsful of sauce tournee, one of mustard, some tarragon and chervil shred small, with three table- spoonsful of Florence oil; putting in, however, a little at a time; when per- fectly smooth, add also, by degrees, a glass of tarragon vinegar anil a little salt. I his sauce cannot be mixed too much. Sauce Languedocienne*—Put a bit of butter rolled in flour into a saucepan with parsley, scallions, a clove of garlic bruised, a glass of cream, and half a glass of olive oil; set it on the fire, and when the whole is dissolved and incorporated

You may serve either rice, Italienne paste, or vermi- celli, previously boiled in the soup.

Potage d la Vienne t*—Take some slices of crumb, about half an inch thick, cut them into squares, ovals, or circles, ac- cording to your fancy; they must, how- ever, be all of the same shape and size, twenty or thirty are sufficient; fry them in a quarter of a pound of butter over a brisk fire ; when they are of a nice colour, lay them on a cloth to drain, then put them into a soup-tureen, and ten minutes before you serve, pour on them any sort of clear purge you may think proper. Potage a la Xavier.*—Take a pound of flour, six yolks, two whole eggs, a little salt, and a sufficient quantity of stock or broth to make the above into a thin paste, to which add a spoonful of shred parsley, some grated nutmeg, a little pepper, and mix them well. Pour some good stock or broth into a saucepan till about three parts full, set it on the fire, and when it boils take a skimmer, through which rub the above-mentioned paste; be careful to keep it constantly boiling, that the paste may stiffen, and skim it well. A quarter of an hour is sufficient time to do this potage. POTATOES d la Anglaise.*—Having well washed as many potatoes as you may require, boil them in salt and water; when nearly done, pare and cut, them into slices, then put them into some melted butter, and fry them lightly; season with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; serve them dry.

Lay this on puff-paste, like other cheesecakes, and bake. Potatoe Biscuits.*—Beat the yolks of fifteen eggs with a pound of sifted sugar, grate the rind of a lemon on a piece of lump sugar; scrape off the yellow sugar with a knife, and having dried it well, add it to the above, and continue to beat till it becomes quite white; in the meantime whip up an equal number of whites, and mix them lightly with the rest; then sift into it half a pound of potatoe flour ; stir it in, and pour the preparation into paper cases, but not to fill them ; glaze, and place the cases on pnper laid on a clean baking- tin, and balte in a moderate oven.

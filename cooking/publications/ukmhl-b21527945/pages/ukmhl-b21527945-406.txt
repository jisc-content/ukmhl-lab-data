OLI OLI 372 German sausage, eight small sausages, seasoned high ; tie all these up that they may not fall to pieces, put them into a braising-pan, with some dry peas (put in warm water the night before). Moisten the whole with good stock, season it with six pimento, four cloves, a little mace, and some nutmeg, all tied in a piece of muslin ; let this boil for some hours. Take four cabbages, ten lettuces, thirty carrots, as many turnips, blanch and put them into a stew-pan covered with slices of bacon, moisten them with the skimmings of the braise; then take a dozen artichoke- bottoms ( trimmed properly and cooked in a blanc ), twenty-four glazed onions, a few small carrots and turnips cut into olives, blanched and dressed in a little consommt and sugar, some French beans cut in lozenges, young beans, peas, and cucumbers, all blanched separately. Drain the meat and vegetables, strain the liquor, skim and clarify and keep it boiling. Press the cabbages and lettuces, and dish them as follows : A piece of cabbage, a carrot, a lettuce, a turnip, and cabbage again, and so on, till you have made a complete circle round your dish ; in the centre put the peas and meat, arrange the artichoke bottoms on the vegetables at equal distances, a glazed onion between each, and having tossed up the small vegetables in a little butter and glaze, place a few in every one of the artichoke bottoms. Glaze the whole and serve it. Olio (Spanish').—'fake some gristles from a breast of veal, also from a brisket of beef, and from a breast of mutton, some sheep’s rumps cut in pieces ; they must all be about the size of a finger; take also five pounds of beef steaks, and put them into a stewing pan, with a quantity of beef stock, a bunch of leeks, a large bunch of celery, they must be stewed till the rumps and gristles are tender; then put in a couple of pigeons, a brace of partridges, two pair of hog’s feet and ears, the knuckle end of a ham, half of a fine white cabbage, some pepper, salt, a bunch of sweet basil, two onions, and some cloves ; cover these over with some thick beef steaks, and over them some veal steaks, pour a little fresh Stock upon them, and leave them to stew over a gentle fire ; let the whole stew till the liquor is evaporated and the ingredients begin to stick at the bottom ; then put in more stock ; while these are stewing, set on some large peas that have been previously soaked in water for four and twenty hours ; set these on to boil in some gravy. 1 he Spaniards make use of a kind of peas, called Caravances ; they are large, and not unlike our grey peas ; but if these are not to be had, any large peas will do; these must be boiled very tender, and be ready at the same time as the olio. A s the stock boils away, put in more ; season the olio according to taste, 'with pepper and salt; have ready a large soup dish, take out the ingredients, one by one, lay them in the dish ; the gristles and the roots must be dispersed about among the othertbings ; then pour over them the peas and their gravy, and then put in a proper quantity of gravy. It must not be eaten as a soup but as an olio, the ingredients in prefer- ence to the liquor. Those who prefer the soup may have it in a basin with toasted bread. OLIVES.—There are three sorts, the Italian, Spanish, and French; they may be had of various sizes and flavours, some prefer one sort, and some another. The fine salad oil is made from this fruit, for which purpose they are gathered ripe ; for pickling they are gathered when only half ripe, at the latter end of June ; they are put into fresh water to soak for a couple of days; after this they are thrown into lime water, in which some pearl ashes have been dissolved ; in this liquor they lie for six and thirty hours; they are then put into water which has had bay salt dissolved in it; this is the last preparation, and they are sent over to us in this liquor ; they are naturally, as they grow on the tree, ex- tremely bitter, and therefore all these pre- pations are necessary to bring them to their fine flavour. To some olives they add a small quantity of essence of spices, which is an oil drawn from cloves, nutmeg, cin- namon, coriander, and sweet fennel-seed, distilled together for that purpose ; twelve drops are sufficient for a bushel of olives; some prefer them flavoured with this essence. Olives (Ragout nf).*—Take some vert- green olives, cut out the stones, so tliat the fruit may close to its original form ; put them, one by one, into water, blanch, and then put them into a good cullis, well seasoned. Olives (Ragout of).*—Take a small quantity of parsley and scallions, shred and give them a few turns in butter, with a little flower; add to this two spoonsful of gravy, a glass of Champagne, capers cut small, an anchovy, some olives, without their stones, a drop of olive oil, and some good cullis ; season it well, clear away the

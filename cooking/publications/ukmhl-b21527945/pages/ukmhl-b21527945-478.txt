POU POU 414 set it in a moderate oven for an hour, or an hour and a half; serve it the instant it is brought from the oven, either glazed or not, according to jour taste. POT1RON or Pumpkin (GAieauof).*— Peel and cut some potiron into small pieces, and put them into a stewpan, with a little milk; when sufficiently soft, press it in a cloth to get rid of all the water ; then give it a few turns in some butter, add some potatoe flour, milk and sugar, and let it boil slowly till of the proper con- sistence, then take it from the fire, and pour it into a basin ; as soon as it is cold, add the yolks of eight eggs, sugar, two spoonsful of orange-flower water, and the whites of four eggs beaten to a snow ; pour this preparation into a well-buttered sauce- pan, and set it on a stove, cover the lid with hot ashes. When done, and suffi- ciently coloured, turn it on a dish, and serve. Potiron, or Pumpkin {Potage of).*—Cut some potiron into rather large dice, which put into a saucepan with a little water, and boil it till sufficiently done ; then put it into a cullender to drain, and when quite dry, rub it through a bolting ; put the puree into a saucepan, with a proper quan- tity of milk, so that the potage be not too thick, and add a quarter of a pound of butter. Cut some slices of bread into such shapes as you may think proper, brown them lightly in a little butter the same as for spinach, lay them in your dish, and pour the potage on them; take care that it be well salted. POUPELIN.* — Put into a saucepan four glasses of water, a quarter of a pound of butter, the zeste of a lemon, and a pinch of fine salt; set it on the fire, and as soon as it begins to boil, take it off, and put in as much sifted flour as will make a paste the consistence of choux, then replace it on the fire, and keep stirring till it dries; make a similar mixture, and when that also is dry, put both into a mortar, with half a pound of powder sugar, an ounce of orange flowers, and two eggs at a time, until five-and-twenty or thirty are used, by which time the paste will be of the proper consistence, then pour it into a lightly buttered tin, put it into a moderato oven, and leave it. In three hours’ time, if the poupelin is of a nice gold colour, take it out, cut oft’ the top, and with a spoon remove all the inside, then set it in the oven to dry. When cold, spread all over the interior apricot marmalade, on which strew sweet macaroons crushed, then turn it on a dish, and serve. Poupelin Hisloiri*—Put into a sauce- pan eight glasses of water, and as many ounces of butter; set it on the fire, and as soon as it boils take it off and add as much sifted flour as will make a stiff paste; re- place it on the fire, stirring constantly for some minutes, to dry; then take it out, and make a second quantity in the same manner; and when that also is dried, put both into a mortar, with three quarters of a pound of sugar, two ounces of orange- flower, and six eggs; then beat it up, add six more, and so on until tire paste is moistened completely with fifty or sixty eggs ; pour this preparation into a large well-buttered mould of twelve sides, and put it into a hot oven. In two hours’ time the paste will rise above the mould, and some parts of it will fall over, which, however, is unavoidable, and of no con- sequence. When it has stood three hours and a half, draw the mould to the opening of the oven, and if the top of the poupelin is of a nice colour, cut it off, and with a large spoon take out all the paste from the interior of the mould, so as to leave a complete croustade withinside, which must remain a few minutes to dry ; then take it’ out, and when nearly cold fill this croustade with three pounds of apricot marmalade, and over that a pound of sweet macaroons, crashed; this done, turn the mould over on a layer of common paste, nearly an inch larger than the top of the mould, which may now be removed. Dissolve in a bain-marie a pot of apple-jellv, and another of red currant-jelly ; then with a feather cover the twelve sides of the pou- pelin alternately with these two jellies ; then mix them together, and by the same means wash over the other pints of the poupelin. If you wish to ornament it still more, cut out a number of leaves of pistachios or green biscuits, which stick on with apricot marmalade, in such form as you may think proper, and between them place well-washed dry currauts. Serve it as soon as possible after it is decorated. Poupelin a la lieine*—Make a choux paste, with very little butter and a good deal of flour, dry it as much as possible, and then dilute it again with eggs. Lay your choux very small, and of an equal size, dorez and put them in the oven ; as soon ns they are well dried, and of a nice colour, oil the mould you intend to use; and having clarified and boiled some sugar to cussc, take up the choux on the end of a skewer, dip them in the sugar, place one in the middle of your mould, and lay the

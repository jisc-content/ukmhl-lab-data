Fii.nr.HT Macaroons.*—Take a pound of filberts, and put a quarter of them into a preserving-pan (immediately after you have taken them from the shells), over a moderate fire ; stir them continually with a silver spoon, until they are coloured, and the skin begins to peel oif; then take them out; rub off the skin entirely, and when quite cold, pound them with a little white of egg : proceed in the same manner with the remaining three quarters ; and when all are thus pounded separately, put the whole together into the mortar, with a pound of sugar, and the whites of two eggs, and beat them for ten minutes ; after which, add two pounds more of sifted sugar, pre- viously beaten up with six whites of eggs; stir all these together well for five or six minutes, when the preparation should be sufficiently firm, to prevent its spreading when laid; if, however, it be too firm, add to it more white of egg. When you have proceeded so far, wet the palms of your hands, and roll a spoonful of the prepara- tion to the size and form of a nutmeg ; when all done, dip your hands in water, and pass them gently over the macaroons, which will make their surface smooth and shining; put them into a nearly cold oven ; close it tight, and let them remain in it for three quarters of an hour. Lay the maca- roons at least an inch apart, and as round as possible. Filbert Mirlilons.*—Peel a quarter of a pound of filberts, and put them into a preserving-pan, over a moderate fire, to colour them lightly; when quite cold, pound them with a little white of egg, to prevent their oiling; then mix them with six ounces of powder sugar, four eggs, and a grain of salt; when well amalgamated, add two ounces of melted fresh butter, and fill your moulds, prepared as for other mir- litons; cover them with very fine sugar, and bake them in a moderate oven. Filbekt Nougats, withwhipped Cream *— Peel half a pound of filberts, and chop them, not very small, and put them into the oven to colour them: then boil a quarter of a pound of powder sugar to a clear reddish colour; mix the filberts with it, and pour into moulds, of whatever form you may think proper; plain ones are, however, the best: then smooth and press the filberts within, so that they may take the form of the mould perfectly; and when wanted for table, put in each a little whipped crenm, flavoured to your fancy: serve them turned over, that the cream may not be visible. These quantities, with eight spoonsful of cream, mixed with a quarter of a pound of sugar, and the aromatic ingredients, will will make about twenty or twenty-four small nougats. Filberts Petits Gdteaux Royaux*—Peel and pound two ounces of filberts to a fine paste, and pass it through a fine hair siere, and mix it with six ounces of sifted sugar, and the white of an egg; the petits gateaux are made in the same manner as petits gdteaux royaux of almonds ; put the above preparation on them, and finish them as directed. Filbert Pralines (Burnt Red).—Take some Barcelona filbert nuts, and crack them, put the kernels into a copper pan or sheet, and put them into the oven to roast, have a pan with syrup boiling, and let it boil till it comes to almost caramel; put a little cochineal into a cup, when the sugar is boiled, add to it the cochineal and the filberts, and stir them with a large wooden spoon, till you find the sugar has got hard round them; put them into a sieve, and se- parate those which stick together; have another pan with syrup in, and boil it as before, and as high; put the same quantity of cochineal in, and mix them as before, as doing them a second time they will be- come a much finer colour; then put them into a box. Filbert Rolls .*—Having peeled half a pound of filberts, put them into a pre- serving-pan over a moderate fire, and stir them constantly with a spatula until they become equallv coloured of alight yellow; then set them "to cool. W lien cold, pound them with a little white of egg to a paste, then mix them with half a pound of flour, the same of powder sugar, and the yolks of four or five eggs, and then finish the operation as directed for Almond Rolls. l)orez, and trace on the surface an ear of wheat, or any thing else, with the point of a knife : take care to drv them well in the baking, that they may be crisp. Coarse powder sugar may also be strewed over, before they are put in the oven. Filbert small Wafers*—lake a quarter of a pound of the preparation used for spoon biscuits, and spread it over a well- buttered baking-plate, with a knife, taking care to keep it of an equal thickness all over; peel a quarter of a pound of filberts, cut them into thin slips, and mix them with two ounces of powder sugar, and a verv little white of egg ; strew this over the above preparation, and bake it in a

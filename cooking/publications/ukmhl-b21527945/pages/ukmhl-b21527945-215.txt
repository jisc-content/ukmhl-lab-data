COD.—A codfish should be firm and white, the gills red, and the eye lively ; a fine fish is very thick about the neck; if the flesh is at all flabby it is not good. Those which come from the Dogger Bank are reckoned the best. Cod is in its prime during the months of October and Novem- ber, if the weatlierbe cold ; from the latter end of March to May, cod is also very fine. The length of time it requires for boiling depends on the size of the fish, which varies from one pound to twenty; a small fish, about two or three pounds weight, will be sufficiently boiled in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the water boils. Prepare a cod for dressing in the following manner: Empty and wash it thoroughly, scrape off all the scales, cut open the belly, and wash and dry it well, rub a little salt inside, or lay it for an hour in strong brine. The simple way of dressing it is as follows: Tie up the head, and put it into a fish-kettle, with plenty of water and salt in it; boil it gently, and serve it with oyster sauce. Lay a napkin under the fish, and garnish with slices of lemon, horse- radish, &c. Cod (Baked).*—Soak a fine piece of fresh cod in melted butter, with parsley and sweet herbs shred very fine; let it stand over the fire for some time, and then bake it. Let it be of a good colour. Another way.*—-Choose a fine large cod, clean it well, and open the under part to the bone, and put in a stuffing made with beef suet, parsley, sweet herbs shred fine, an egg, and seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, mace, and grated lemon peel; put this inside the cod, sew it up, wrap it in a buttered paper, and bake it; baste it well with melted butter.

Cod en Dauphin.*—Your cod being properly prepared, marinate it for a couple of hours in sweet oil, with salt, pepper, scallions, bay leaf, parsley, and garlic. Then pass an iron skewer through the eyes, the middle of the body, and bring it out at the tail, making it in the form of a dolphin ; place it in a baking-pan, baste it with the marinade, and bake it. When sufficiently done, take out the skewer, put it on a dish, and pour over it the following ragout: Boil up (separately) three carps’ roes, and sora,e asparagus heads, and then put them into a stewpan with a hit of but- ter, mushrooms, parsley, and scallions; do them over the fire, and add a pinch of Hour, a glass of white wine, and the same of soup tnaigre. When the rago&t is suffi- ciently done, thicken it with three yolks of eggs, and some cream.

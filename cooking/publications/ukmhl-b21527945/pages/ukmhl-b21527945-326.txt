ham 292 HAM and let it remain a month ; then take it out, drain and smoke it; when thoroughly dry, rub it all over with equal quanties of wine and vinegar, to prevent the flies from touching it; be sure to let it dry well. Ham in March-pane.—Take eightpounds of march-pane paste, knead it up with one pound of loaf sugar to whiten it (and the longer you work them together the whiter it becomes) ; cut it in two parts, one about five pounds weight, the other three; put the latter aside. Then take of'cinnamon, cloves, and bole armenia, half an ounce each, pounded very fine, mix them with the largest portion, and add to it a sufficient quantity of red sandal to give it the fine colour of boiled ham ; the whole being well mixed, work it up in the form of a ham; make several incisions in it with a knife, in which insert very thin pieces of the white paste, to represent veins of fat in the lean ; then close these places with your hands. Roll the white paste to about two or three inches thick, and having moistened the surface of your red paste with water, cover it with the white paste in imitation of the fat, taking care to make it thinner towards the knuckle and sides (as in real ham) than at the higher parts. Then boil a quarter of a pound of chocolate in about a quarter of a pint-of water, stirring constantly till it is tolerably thick, dip ahairpencil into it, and do the ham over with it several times, until it forms a kind of crust, like the rind ; this may be covered with crushed macaroons, to resemble the rasped bread with which a boiled ham is generally covered. The chocolate must be kept warm whilst the latter operation is being performed, as otherwise it will become quite hard ; the flavour is greatly improved by adding vanilla to the chocolate. Ham au Naturel.*—Take afine large ham, trim it in the following manner: take off the rind, and every particle of yellow which may be on the fat; take off, also, the end hone, cut the knuckle, and soak the ham, and cook it as directed, (ham a la gelde), When sufficiently done, untie the napkin, take out the bone, then tie it again, lay it in a deep dish and let it cool; trim it, and do it over with rasp- ings ; serve it on a napkin. IIam Omelet.*—Take a slico of boiled liam, mince it ns small as possible, and mix it with a dozen eggs, beaten, with a little veal gravy; fry it (keeping it of an equal thickness) in tlie usual manner. Ham Pie.—Bono fine ham, and trim it properly, taking care to cut off all the yellow fat; soak it according to its age, and then braise it on slices of beef, a pound of bacon (beaten in a mortar), the same quantity of lard and butter, plenty of sweet herbs, roots, and whole pepper. When about three parts done, take it out, and let it cool; then make a thick raised crust, put the ham into it, with all the braise, except the beef and herbs, a largo glass of brandy; hake it for an hour, and serve it cold. Ham Pie.*—Dress a fine ham as for la gelee (see that article); make a farce as follows : —Take a sous noix of veal, and mince it very small, with an equal quantity of bacon, and the trimmings of the liam when cold (minced small also); season it with salt, pepper, spices, and sweet herbs, shred small; then take all the ingredients, and pound them together, adding, occasionally, a small quantity of jelly. Take three pounds of paste for raised crust, of which form the bottom and sides of your pie, put it on two sheets of buttered paper ; lay some of the farce at the bottom of your pie, cut the ham in half, lay one piece on the farce, season, and cover it with the farce ; then put in another piece, season that also, and fill up your pie with the remainder of the farce, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; moisten the borders of the pie and put on the top, fasten the edges together, decorate the crust, and add, if you like, a false top of puff-paste ; make a hole in the middle, dorez, and bake it in a hot oven for three or four hours ; if, in the meanwhile, it is inclined to take too high a colour, cover it with a wet paper. Ham (Potted).—Take a pound of cold, boiled, lean ham, and pound it to fine paste, with a quarter of a pound of the fat, or some fresh butter; season it to your taste, with mace, allspice, pepper, and nut- meg (all in powder). Press it into pot- ting dishes, pour clarified butter over it, and keep it in a cool place. Ham ( Hag out of).—Cut some thin slices of ham, and having beaten them well, lay them at the bottom of a stewpan; place a dish over them, and set the saucepan on a stove till they begin to stick; then put in a little flour, and keep the pan moving; moisten with a little veal gravy that has no salt in it, add pepper and sweet herbs, and simmer over a slack fire ; add veal and ham cullis to thicken ; set it before the fire, basting it well till it is a clear

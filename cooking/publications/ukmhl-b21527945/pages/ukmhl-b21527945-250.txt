Stir it together during four-and-twenty hours, two or three times, and then fill up the cask with water, and close it. This quan- tity of fruit will make a hundred and fifty bottles of excellent wine. If you desire to make it stronger, put in a pint or two of brandy. Currant (Black) Wine.—Take three pounds of ripe black currants : pick and bruise them, and put them into a deep basin, with four bottles and a half of brandy ; add, if you please, some cloves, and a little bruised cinnamon, and set the jar in a place for two months. At the end of that time, strain oft' the liquor, pressing the currants well, in order to extract all the juice, which put again into the jar, with a pound and three quarters of sugar ; leave it till the sugar is completely melted, and then strain through paper, and bottle off. This liquor becomes ex- cellent after three or four years’ keeping.

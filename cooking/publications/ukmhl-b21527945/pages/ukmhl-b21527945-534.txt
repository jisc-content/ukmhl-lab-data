TUR TUR 500 Turkey (Cold)—May be served gar- nished with savory jelly and water- cresses. Turkey en Daitbe.*—Take an old tur- key, truss it in the usual way ; roll some large lardons in a mixture of salt, pepper, spices, and sweet herbs, and then lard the turkey with them ; lay slices of bacon in a braising-pan, put the turkey on them, with two small knuckles of veal, the feet of the bird, four carrots, six onions, three cloves, two bay leaves, thyme, a bunch of parsley, cover the whole with bacon and a piece of buttered paper; dilute it with four ladiesful of stock (or more if the turkey be very large), putin a little salt, and set the pan on the fire to boil slowly for three hours and a half; then take it oil’, but do not take the bird out for at least half an hour. Strain off the liquor, and then reduce it to a fourth, or more if very thin; break an egg into another saucepan, beat it up well, and then pour the liquor on it, whisk them well together, and if it wants flavour, add a few sweet herbs, parsley leaves, and a young onion or two ; put it on the fire, stirring it vio- lently until ready to boil; as soon as it has boiled up once or twice, set it by the side of a stove, put fire on the top of the saucepan, and let it simmer half an hour ; then strain it carefully through a fine cloth, and let it cool to serve it with the turkey. Turkey' a la Fourrd*— Take a fine plump turkey, bone it carefully through the back without injuring the skin. Take two slices of very white tender veal, lard these slices quite through with large lardons, and put them within the turkey ; lard also the inside of the bird, but do not pierce the skin ; close the opening, and give the bird an oval form, jthe pinion bones and drumsticks ought to be left on; tie up the turkey, spit and roast it gently, basting with its own gravy. Turkey (Galantine of).*—Take a fine fat turkey, bone it entirely, beginning with the back, and taking great care not to injure the breast, remove all the sinews from the legs; cut away the meat from the thickest parts, so as to make it all nearly the same level ; take some of this meat, cold chicken, or meat of any kind vou please; if you have two pounds of lean, take two pounds of fat bacon, mince them small, and add salt, pepper, spices, and sweet herbs; lard your turkey with moderate - sized lardons well seasoned. Spread all over the bird a layer of the farce an inch thick, on which place truf- fles, tongue a 1 6carlate, bacon, turkey, fowl, and fat livers, all cut into pieces about half an inch thick, and an inch and a half long; cover these with another layer of farce, and continue this operation alternately till all the farce is used ; then roll up the turkey, nearly in its proper form, but so that none of the farce may- escape ; sew it up, cover it with slices of bacon, wrap it in a coarse cloth with four or five bay leaves, tie it closely ; place it in a braising-pan on slices of bacon ; add two knuckles of veal, six carrots, six onions, a large bunch of parsley and scal- lions, the bones of the turkey, four bay leaves, a little thyme, three cloves, and three ladiesful or more of stock ; cover your braising-pan close, and set it on the fire, and let it simmer for three hours. When done, take it from the fire, but leave the turkey in for half an hour ; on taking it from the pan, press it gently to get out all the gravy ; when quite cold, unwrap the bird ; strain the gravy through a lawn sieve, beat up an egg in it, set it on the fire, stirring till it boils, then put it by the side of the stove, with fire on the saucepan lid ; in about half an hour, strain it again and leave it to cool; use it to garnish. Turkey Giblets a la Bourgeoise.—The pinions, neck, feet, liver, and gizzard, compose the giblets; when scalded and chopped, put them into a stewpan, with -a little butter, parsley, scallions, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, basil, mushrooms, and a clove or two; moisten these with stock, season with pepper and salt; when enough, strain and thicken; add a few turnips slightly fried in a little butter. Turkey Giblets (Fricassee of).—Scald thoroughly the giblets from as many tur- keys as will make a handsome dish, then stew them rvell in two ounces of butter, as directed for them a la bourgeoise. When done, take out the herbs, make a liaison with tire yolks of three eggs, a little cream, and some vinegar, and serve. Turkey in its own Gravy—Take out the breastbone of a turkey, and stuff it with a sweetbread scalded, mushroom cut into small pieces, grated bacon, pepper, and salt; put the turkey, covered with slices of bacon, into a braising-pan just large enough to bold it, with a very little stock, a quarter of pint of white wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, thvme, bay leaf, a few cloves, and a little nutmeg ; let it braise slowly, and turn it two or three times: when donej skint the sauce, strain it, add

392 OYS OYS layers, and season very moderately with salt, pepper, and mace; then add half a tea-cupful of liquor, and half a tea-cupful of gravy; hake in a slow oven, and before you serve, put a tea-cupful of cream, a little more oyster liquor, and a cupful of white gravy, all wanned, but not boiled. If for patties, the oysters must be cut into small dice, gently stewed and seasoned as above, and put into the paste when ready for table. Oyster Petits Pates*—Prepare your timbules in the usual way; boil the oysters in their own liquor, when done, beard, and if large, cut them in half; put them into a bechamel, or if you have none, put a piece ofbutter the size of a walnut, a tea-spoon- ful of flour, and a little pepper, into a saucepan; stir them together over the fire, then add the liquor, still stirring, and in a little while, put in the oysters; thicken with the whites of two eggs, make it quite hot, but do not let it boil; put this preparation into the petits pates, and serve them. Oyster Patties a la Frangaise.*—Stew your oysters in their own liquor, bear'd and cut them into dice, also cut some mush- rooms into dice, and fry them in a little butter and flour; add some of the oyster liquor, one or two spoonsful of consomm6, a ladleful of cream; when reduced, add a small quantity of butter, season with salt and Cayenne pepper; throw in the oysters, have the patties ready, and in a minute or two fill them with the above. Oysters (Pickled).—Procure some of the largest sort of oysters, and wash four dozen in their own liquor, wipe them dry, strain the liquor off, add to it a dessert- spoonful of pepper, two blades of mace, three table-spoonsful of white wine, and four of vinegar, and if the liquor is not very salt, you may put one table-spoonful of salt; simmer the oysters for a few mi- nutes in the liquor, then put them into small jars, and boil up the pickle, skim it, and when cold, pour it over the oysters; keep them closely covered. Oyster Sauce.—In opening the oysters save the liquor, and boil it with the beards, a bit of mace, and lemon peel; in the meantime throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it off, strain the liquor, and put it into a saucepan with the oysters just drained from the cold water, with a suffi- cient quantity of butter, mixed with as much milk as will make enough sauce ; but first rub a little flour with it; set them over the fire and stir all the time, and when the butter has boiled take them off, and keep the saucepan close to the fire, but not upon it; for if done too much, the oysters will become hard; add a squeeze of lemon juice, and serve. A little anchovy essence is a great improvement. Oyster Sauce for Entries.—Blanch the oysters in their own liquor; then make a white roux, to which add a few small onions, mushrooms, parsley, and scallions; moisten with some of the oyster liquor, and a la- dleful or two of consomme, set it on a brisk fire, and when reduced, add a pint of cream, season it; let the sauce be tolerably thick, strain it through a silk sieve, put in the oysters, and use it with those articles where it is required, such as fowl, turkey, chicken, &c. If served with fish, essence of anchovies must be added to the above ingredients. Oyster Sauce for Beef Steaks.— Blanch a pint of oysters, and preserve their liquor; then wash and beard them, and put their liquor into a stewpan, with India soy and ketchup, a small quantity of each, a gill of cullis, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a little scraped horseradish and three shal- lots ; set them over a fire, and when they nearly boil, thicken with roux ; season ac- cording to taste, with a little Cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice ; strain it to the oysters, and stew them gently five mi- nutes. Oyster Sausages.—Take the lean of the inside of a loin of mutton clean from the skin and strings, the same of the kid- ney suet, and double the quantity of oys- ters, bearded, and wiped dry; chop all together very small, and season them with pepper and salt; then roll them up in flour, the size of sausages, and fry them in butter. Oysters (Scalloped).—Blanch the oys- ters, beard them, butter some scallop shells, sprinkle them with pepper and very little salt, grated nutmeg, parsley chopped fine, and bread crumbs, put in your oysters, season again with the above ingredients, thicken some of the liquor with flour and butter, pour a little of it over the oysters, and then cover all over with bread crumbs, sprinkle some oiled butter on the top, set them in the oven for twenty minutes, and if not coloured, brown with the salamander. The parsley and nutmeg some object to : it may therefore bo omitted. Oysters on Skewers.—Put a bit ofbutter into a stewpan, then put in some large oys- ters, and some mushrooms, with pepper, salt, pounded cloves, parsle'- and sweet

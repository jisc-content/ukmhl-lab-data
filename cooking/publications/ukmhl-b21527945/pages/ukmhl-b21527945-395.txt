361 MUT MUT a stewpan, and keep turning them over the lire, with a small piece of butter and a slice of ham, till they begin to take colour, adding a little flour, and moistening with equal quantities of stock and gravy. If you do not happen to have any gravy, let the cucumbers be more coloured before they are taken from the fire ; they should then be stewed gently, occasionally skim- ming off the fat; when they are done, add a little cullis to thicken them. Having thus prepared your ragout of cucumbers, take any joint of cold roast mutton (the leg is the best), cut it into thin slices, and put it into the ragout to heat, but taking care not to let it boil; season to palate. Mutton (Hashed) with fine Herbs.1*— Cut your meat as directed for hashed mut- ton and poached eggs; dress it also in the same manner, leave it in the saucepan; put two ounces of butter into another sauce- pan, with a dessert spoonful of shalots, shred small; set them on the fire, but do not colour them ; then take four spoonsful of mushrooms, all shred small, give them a few turns with the shalots, after which add a dessert spoonful of shred parsley; stir them all together, reduce, and pour them on the hash; give the whole a sim- mer, and then serve with sippets round. Mutton (Hashed) and Poached Eggs .*— Cut the meat from a cold roasted leg of mutton, take out all the sinews, and skin, mince it very small, and put it in a sauce- pan ; reduce four spoonsful of espagnole to one; pour it over the meat; mix it in well, set it on the fire, but do not let it boil ; when done, pour it into a dish with fried bread, cut like corks, round, and poached eggs on it. Mutton (Haunch, of).— It should he kept as long as you can possibly keep it sweet by the different modes ; and if ne- cessary, wash it with warm milk and water, or vinegar, and when going to be dressed, be careful to wash it well, to prevent the outside from having a bad flavour from keeping ; before you put the haunch to the fire, fold it in a paste of coarse flour, and strong paper; then set it a good distance from the fire, and allow proportionable time for the paste; do not take it off till about five minutes before serving the mut- ton, and then baste continually; bring the haunch nearer before taking off the paste, and froth it up in the same manner as ve- nison. For gravy, take a pound and a half of loin of mutton, and simmer it in a pint of water till reduced to half, use no season- ing but salt; brown it with a little burnt sugar, and serve it up in the dish; hut there should be a good deal of gravy in the meat, for though long at the fire, the cover- ing and distance will prevent its roasting out. Serve with currant-jelly. Mutton (Leg oj).—If your leg of mut- ton is roasted, serve with onion or currant- jelly sauce; if it is boiled, serve with caper-sauce and vegetables. In roasting or boiling, a quarter of an hour is usually allowed for each pound of meat. Mutton (Leg of) a VAnglaise*—Lard the fleshy part of a leg of mutton with fat bacon, tie it with packthread, and put it into a pot just large enough to hold it, with some stock, a bunch of parsley, and green onions, a clove of garlic, three cloves, a bay leaf, thyme, basil, some salt and pep- per ; when it is done, let it drain, wipe off the fat with a cloth, and serve with a sauce made in the following manner: put a tumblerful of stock, and nearly the same quantity of cullis, into a stewpan, with some capers and anchovies, a little parsley, a shalot, and the yolk of an egg boiled hard ; let the sauce boil a few minutes, and serve it with the mutton. Mutton (Leg of) a la Bourgeoise.*— Take a nice round leg of mutton, bone it, and lard the inside of it with lardons rolled in salt, pepper, and spices; tie it up into its original form, and put it into a braising-pan, with a dozen carrots, a dozen onions, as many potatoes, two bay- leaves, two cloves, parsley, and a ladleful of stock or water; add to these a pound of bacon cut into six pieces, a little salt; sim- mer it for three hours and a half, stirring it occasionally; at the end of that time take out the mutton, untie, and dish it with the vegetables round it. Mutton (Leg of) with Cauliflowers and Parmesan Cheese.*-—Boil a leg of mutton a l’Anglaise, then blanch some cauliflowers, and boil them in another water, with a bit of butter and a little salt; then take the dish you intend to serve in, and put into it a little sauce made with cullis, a slice of butter, salt, coarse pepper, and thickened over the fire; put into the dish with this sauce some grated Parmesan cheese; put the mutton in the dish, and pour the re- mainder of the sauce over it, add moro cheese, and set tire dish upon a stove over a slow fire, under a cover that will admit fire at the top, until it be of a fine high brown, and the sauce thick ; before you serve it to table, drain off all the fat.

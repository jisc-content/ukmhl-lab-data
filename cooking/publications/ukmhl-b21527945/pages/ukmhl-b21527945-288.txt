Simmer the whole gently for twenty minutes, then strain it through a sieve, and put it into bottles for use ; the proper way to use it is by putting some of it into tbe butter while melting.

They must be corked very close, and sealed at the top. Fish Sauce (White).—Simmer to the quantity required, an anchovy, a glass of white wine, a bit of horseradish, two or three blades of mace, an onion stuck with cloves, a piece of lemon peel, and a quarter of a pint of water; strain it, put in two spoonsful of cream, a large bit of butter mixed well with some flour ; keep stirring it till it boils, add a little ketchup, squeeze in a little lemon juice when off the fire. More wine may be added if agreeable. Fish Soup.—-Take pieces of different sorts of fish, such as the salmon, skate, sole, &c.; sweat them till tender, with turnip, nion, celery, a clove of garlic, and a blade of mace ; then add some plain veal broth. Simmer the whole together for half an hour; then strain, and skim it free from fat; season with salt and Cayenne pepper, clear it with white of egg, and colour with a little safl'ron. It may be served to table with celery or rice in it. Fish (Tureen of).—Take fresh-waterfish of any kind, or different sorts together.

Flounders (Boiled).—Put on a stewpan with a sufficient quantity of water to cover the flounders which are to be dressed; put in some vinegar and horseradish ; when the water boils put in the fish, having been first wTell cleaned, and their fins cut off; they must not boil too fast for fear they should break; when they are sufficiently done, lay them on a fish-plate, the tails in the middle. Serve them with parsley and butter.

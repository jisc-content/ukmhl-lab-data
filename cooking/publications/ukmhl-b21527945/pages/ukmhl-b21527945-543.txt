VEA VEA 509 veal into slices an inch thick, season them with salt and pepper, and give them a few turns in a little butter, with a bay leaf. Lay at the bottom of a deep saucepan a very thin slice of bacon, and on it one of the slices of veal, and continue to lay them in alternately, until the whole are used, then add a glass of water and some bay leaves ; close the saucepan very tight, first putting a sheet of paper over the meat; stew it on hot ashes for four or five hours ; take care to keep the fire up to the same point all the time. Serve with a piquant sauce. Veal Stock.—Cut a leg of veal and some lean ham into pieces, put them into a stewpan, with a little water, some carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celery; stew them down till nearly done, but do not let it colour ; then add a sufficient quan- tity of beef stock to cover the ingredients, and let it boil for three hours, skim off all the fat and strain it; a little game stewed down with the above will greatly improve the flavour; be particularly careful that it does not burn. Veal a la Villageoise,—Season some large slices of veal with pepper, salt, fine spices, parsley, and shalots; cut likewise some thin slices of ham, dip them in egg, and lay them on the slices of veal, and wrap the ham up in the veal, and let them boil with a glass of white wine, and the same quantity of stock ; when done, skim, and strain the sauce, and serve it in the dish with the veal, without adding any thing else. Veal (Breast of) collared.—Bone a breast of veal, and beat it; rub it over with the yolk of an egg, and strew over a little beaten mace, nutmeg, pepper, salt, a large handful of parsley chopped small, a few sprigs of sweet marjoram, a little lemon peel shred fine, and an anchovy pounded, and mixed with a few bread crumbs. Roll it up tight, bind it with a tape, and wrap it in a cloth ; then let it boil two hours and a half in salt and water, then take it out, and hang it up by one end to drain, then put it into the following pickle : A pint of salt and water, and half a pint of vinegar. Veal (Breast of) collared.—Bone a breast of veal, and with a feather or brush do it all over with the yolk of egg well beaten; take some crumbs of bread, a little grated nutmeg, beaten mace, pepper, salt, a few sweet herbs, and a little lemon peel cut small; strew these all over the veal; run a thick skewer into it to keep it together: roll it up tight, aqd bind it very close with tape; wrap it in a veal caul, and roast it; before being taken up, take off the caul, sprinkle the meat with salt, and baste it with butter; it should be roasted before a brisk fire, and done of a nice brown ; when it is taken up, cut it in three or four slices, lay it in a dish; have ready a boiled sweetbread, cut it in slices, and lay round the dish (some prefer it larded), and serve a good white sauce over the veal. Veal (Breast of) glact-c.’*—Cut the breast as square as possible, bone it to within two inches of the gristles, and tie down the meat, so that the joint may look very plump, and cut the soft bones beyond the gristles.

Clove Pustils.—Are made like those of .cinnamon. The proportions are six cloves to half an ounce of gum dragon. Cloves (Dantsic Ratafa).*—Take three quarters of an ounce of cloves, and the same of cinnamon, broken in small pieces, and put them into half a pint of water; let them infuse for twenty-four hours.

When quite cold, take out the bag and squeeze it. Then take a bottle of rectified spirits of wine in one hand, and a spoon in the other; pour the former into ■the liquor, stirring constantly; taste it fre- quently, and when sufficiently strong of the spirit, cease pouring. It may be bot- tled immediately, cork it tight, tie the corks down and seal them. The longer this liqueur is kept, the better it will be.

Clove Gillyflowers (Syrup of).—Gather the flowers early in the morning, pick them clean, and cut the white from the red ; to a quart of flowers put two quarts of spring water, let it stand for two days in a cold place, and after boiling it till it comes to a quart, strain it off, and put in half a pound of double refined sugar, and boil it up again for three or four minutes ; pour it into a china basin, let it.stand to cool, and when it is quite cold, skim it; put it into bottles, cork them well, and tie them down, with leather.

Boil all together a short time, and strain it. If to be kept any time, an ounce of loaf sugar should be boiled with it. COCKLES.*—This fish should be pro- cured a day or two before they are wanted, that they may be cleaned as much as pos- sible from the grits; they are cleansed as follows: Put the cockles into a tub with plenty of water, and stir them up two or three times a day with a birch broom - change the water each day; and when pro- perly cleaned, put them into a saucepan with hot water, and boil them. As soon as the shells open, they are done: they should be served very hot. Or put a very little water at the bottom of the pan, sprinkle them with salt, cover with a cloth, and then the lid of the pan; steam them a short time ; when they are open they are done : serve very hot with a little of' their liquor. Cockle Catsup.—Wash the quantity of cockles you may require in their own liquor, and having pounded them, to every pint of the paste put an equal quantity of sherry ; boil them, and put to them an ounce of salt, the same of Cayenne, and two drachms of pounded mace.

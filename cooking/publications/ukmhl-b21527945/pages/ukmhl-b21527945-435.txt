Partridges (Filletsof) a la Chingara.—• Take the fillets of three partridges, and having trimmed, fry them lightly in a little butter; then cover them with a piece of buttered paper; take six slices of tongue il Vicariate, cut them to the size and shape of the fillets, heat them with some stock in a deep dish; mince the trimmings of the tongue; then reduce three spoonsful of espagnole and the fumet (made with the remnants of the partridges) to a demi- glaze. Dish the fillets en couronne, with the tongue between each, pour a part of the sauce over them; put the mince to the remainder; mix them well, add to them a small piece of butter, and put it into the centre of the dish. Partridge (Fillets of) a la Mimglas*— Take the fillets from six partridges, re- move the skin, decorate one side with truffles placed in chequers, and lay them this side downwards in melted butter, do not let them touch; cover them with a buttered paper; take an equal number of the small fillets, fry them lightly, and when cold cut them into scallops, with as many truffles and mushrooms ; reduce four spoonsful of veloute, and two of espagnole, strain it over the scallops, and keep them hot in the bain-marie; fry the fillets lightly over hot ashes ; when nearly done, add a small quantity of demi-glaze. Arrange your fillets round a dish alternately with fried bread cut in hearts, pour the scallops into the centre, glaze, and serve. Partridge (Fillets of) with Oranges.*— Take the fillets from eight roasted par- tridges (they should be but slightly done), .place them on a piece of fried bread, and pour over them the following sauce :— four ladiesful of espagnole travuille, a little whole pepper, the juico of a Seville orange, and some of the peel: give this a boil, and pour it over. PASTE (Puff).—Be very particular that your slab or paste-table, rolling-pin, and cutters, are clean, and free from all old 'paste; and be very careful that both the flour and butter are extremely good. Have a dry sieve always in readiness, in or by the flour-tub, so as to use none with- out sifting it; for, though it may appear pure and fine, bran, or small particles of old paste, may have fallen into it; sifting is, therefore, always necessary. Weigh one pound of flour, lay it in a circle on the slab ; break one egg in the centre, put a small quantity of salt, and a little bit of butter; mix all these to- gether lightly, add a little water, mix them again, then add more water, and so proceed until it binds into paste ; but take care that you do not make it too stiff", nor squeeze it much together, till you find there is sufficient water ; then work it well together, and roll it out on the slab, but do not roll it too thin ; work a pound of butter on the slab, spread it out to the size of the paste, with a knife cut it off altogether, and lay it on the paste ; then double the ends of the paste together, to inclose the butter; then give it one turn thus : roll it out till you just perceive the butter through the paste ; turn the end which is next to you half way over, and the other end over that, roll it once or twice with the rolling- pin ; then let it stand : this is called one turn : then, in three minutes time turn it again, and so proceed until you have given it six turns ; then roll it out and cut it for petits-pdtes, or any shape you please ; but observe not to put over them too much egg, as that will prevent their rising ; as soon as they are baked, take them off" the sheet, lay them on paper, and when cold scrape the bottoms, neatly cut out the insides, ready for whatever you mean to put into them. For baking, see Directions for the Oven. Paste (Royal) called Petit Choux.—Boil in half a pint of water the peel of a lemon, a little sugar, a quarter of a pound of but- ter, and a few bits of cinnamon ; add a pinch of salt. Strain it, and put imme- diately to it as much dry flour as it can possibly absorb; stir it well on the fire till it quits the pan ; take it off", and while it is hot, stir in as many eggs one by one as will make it ot a good consistence ; about six eggs will do it. Paste (Croquante).*—Blanch a pound of almouds, dry them well in the stove, and pound them to a dry paste, adding occasionally white of egg and orange- flower, put the paste into a stewpan, and set it on a slow fire, putting in the sugar a little at a time, and stirring constantly. When the pasto is sufficiently consistent, 2 D

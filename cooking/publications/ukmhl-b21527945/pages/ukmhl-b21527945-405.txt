371 OLI OIL instead of flour, and three gallons, of water instead of two : pull the dough into pieces, roll and finish the cakes as di- rected for muffins. When wanted, pull the edges apart, toast them nicely on both sides, and then open them com- pletely; lay in small pieces of butter, until you have as much as you may want; close them again, set them before the fire, and cut each in halves or quarters. Oatmeal Pudding.—Pour a quart of boiling milk over a pint of the very best fine oatmeal; let it soak all night; the next day beat two eggs, and mix a little salt: put it in a basin just large enough to hold it; cover it tight with a floured cloth, and boil it an hour and a half. Eat it with cold butter and salt. When cold, slice and toast it, and eat it as oak cake buttered. Oatmeal Pudding ( New England Fashion).—Steep a pint of whole oatmeal in a quart of boiling milk the over night ; in the morning shred half a pound of beef suet very fine, and mix with the oatmeal and milk some grated nutmeg and a little salt, with the yolks and whites of three eggs, a quarter of a pound of cur- rants, a quarter of a pound of raisins, and a sufficient quantity of sugar to sweeten it; stir the whole well together, tie it pretty close, and boil it for two hours. Serve with melted butter for sauce. OIL of Jupiter*—Take three quarts of spirits of wine, flavoured with essential oil of lemon, the same quantity flavoured with spirit of cedrat; make a syrup with seven pounds of sugar, a gallon of water, and two bottles of Scubac; mix the whole together, and by stirring it will become thick; to clarify it, take the whites of two eggs in about a pint of the liqueur, and afterwards put it to the whole ; stir it; then put it into a still in the bain- marie moderately heated : let it remain for twelve hours; filter the produce of your distillation, and bottle it. Oil of Venus.*—-Reduce the following articles to an impalpable powder : an ounce of skirret seeds, an ounce of carra- way seeds, an ounce of anise seeds, a drachm and a half of mace, and the rind of an orange; infuse these for five days in a gallon of brandy, then distil from it in a bain-marie, two quarts of liqueur; dissolve over the fire four pounds of sugar in two quarts of pure water; when cold, mix it with the distilled liqueur, and colour it of a clear yellow, with a little tincture of saffron; filter and bottle it; seal the corks. Oil Toast.—Toast some slices of bread, and whilst hot, baste them with oil and lemon juice; pepper and salt them, and serve very hot. OLIO (n French one )■—-Take five pounds of steak, cut very thick, from the leg of mutton piece of beef; put them into a deep stewpan, add five pounds of any part of veal, and a leg of mutton of about six or seven pounds, which must be skinned and have the fat taken off; cover it very closely, and set it over the stove with a very moderate fire ; let it stand till the gravy begins to run ; quicken the fire, and let it stand till the meat be- gins to stick to the pan, but not longer, as it should not be too brown ; pour a little beef gravy into it, and stir it about; when, thoroughly mixed, put it into a pot, set it upon the fire very closely covered, with a sufficient quantity of gravy to fill the pot; then take twelve carrots, nine parsnips, eight onions, and six tin-nips; put these into the pot, with a hunch of leeks, a bundle of celery, and a handful of suet; let these boil well together, find then put in a fowl, a turkey, and a couple of pigeons; add a couple of pounds of ham, cut in thick slices; keep it boiling, and as the scum rises, skim it off very clean ; while these are doing, take four French rolls rasped, pare off the crusts, and put them into a stewpan with a little of the olio liquor; when they are soft, put them into a tureen or into a very deep soup dish; pour in the liquor ; let there be some celery, and some of the other roots put in, with some of the best pieces of the meat, and the pigeons put in whole. This is the way to make the plain French olio ; but they often put in partridges to stew in the gravy, sometimes half roasting them before they put them in. Olio (Maigre). — Scald all sorts of roots, such as onions, carrots, parsnips, parsley roots, turnips, celery, and leeks ; then boil them in some pease broth, with a mignonette, and some carp trimmings; when the above vegetables are sufficiently done, put in a little root gravy, strain and set it by for any purpose which you may require. Olio (Spanish).*—Take ten pounds of rump of beef, a brisket of veal, a breast of mutton, a knucklo of ham, a chicken, two pigeons, two quails, two old par- tridges, larded and trussed like chickens, a duck, a pound of streakod bacon, a raw 2 n 2

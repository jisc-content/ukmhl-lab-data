RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. 169 for totally extirpating the destructive vermin. The following means were resorted to, and they were attended with the most perfect success. A number of corks, cut down as thin as sixpences, were roasted or stewed in grease, and then placed in the way of the rats. The dish was greedily de- voured as a special delicacy, and, as was antici- pated, they all died of indigestion. TO DESTROY SLUGS, CATERPILLARS, ETC. Put in an iron pot a pound of quick lime, and a pound of sulphur. Stir them about quickly; and, whilst doing so, put in six pounds of water, which is to boil. Snails will immediately leave any place watered with this composition; and, if trees are watered with it, any caterpillars upon them will die instantly. TO DESTROY THISTLES, ETC. A farmer states, that “ having once a pasture field, that seemed one entire bed of common thistles, and having occasion to carry manure across it to another field, I observed all the thistles completely killed wherever the carts went; f therefore set to, and rolled the whole field with a cast-iron roller, once in the latter end of May, and twice in the beginning of June. The field has been free from thistles ever since. The expense was only three shillings per acre. Fern and coltsfoot I have exterminated in the same way.” Q

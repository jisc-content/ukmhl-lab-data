110 THE FRUGAL to a pulp with a rasp, or mortar; to five pounds of this pulp, which must be very uniform and homogeneous, add a pint of sour milk and the requisite portion of salt; knead the whole well, cover it, and let it remain three or four days, according to the season; then knead it afresh, and place the cheeses in small baskets, when they will part with their superfluous moisture ; dry them in the shade, and place them in layers in large pots or kegs, where they may remain a forltaight. The older they are, the finer they become. This cheese has the advantage of never engen- dering worms, and of being preserved fresh for many years, provided it is kept in a dry place, and in well closed vessels.

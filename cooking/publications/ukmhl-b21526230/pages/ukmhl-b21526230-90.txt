THE FRUGAL 02 and cored, in a piece of crust, and tying them up in spots all over the bag. These do not need to be boiled more than an hour: three quarters is enough, if the apples are tender. Take sweet or pleasant flavoured apples, pare them, and bore out the core, without cutting the apple in two. Fill up the holes with washed rice, boil them in a bag, tied very tight, an hour, or hour and a half. Each apple should be tied up separately, in different corners of the pudding- bag. CHERRY PUDDING. For cherry dumpling, make a paste about as rich as you make short-cake; roll it out, and put in a pint and a half or a quart of cherries, ac- cording to the size of your family. Double the crust over the fruit, tie it up tight in a bag, and boil one hour and a half. CRANBERRY PUDDING. A pint of cranberries stirred into a quart of batter, made like a batter pudding, but very little stiffer, is very nice, eaten with sweet sauce. WHORTLEBERRY PUDDING. Whortleberries are good in flour puddings. Make your pudding just like batter puddings; but considerably thicker, or the berries will sink. Two hours is plenty long enough to boil. No pudding should be put in till the water boils. Leave room to swell.

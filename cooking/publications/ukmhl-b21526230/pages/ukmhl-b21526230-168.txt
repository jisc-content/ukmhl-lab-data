RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. 100 that are put in, require the pit to be more filled; either rotten tail or decayed leaves will do, with a little earth on the top to raise the level of the surface within the pit sufficiently high, that plants may receive the benefit of the sun and air. The whole of the plants in the pit are occasionally attended to, and all decayed yellow leaves re- moved. As much air is given every day as pos- sible. In the autumn, when the weather is mild and dry, the covers are frequently taken off alto- gether during the day. I endeavour at all times to prevent the pit being saturated with moisture. When the weather is rainy, the covers are lowered on the tilts, and they are shut down every night. During the winter, if the frost sets in severe, I frequently put on a covering of litter about the covers, to exclude the frost more effectually. I have known the pit covered up in this way, night and day, for a fortnight and three weeks together, without the vegetable suffering in the least; and, as a proof, this winter I had plenty of fine cauli- flowers for the table till the end of January, with a constant supply of endives and other vegetables. I never hesitate to lift the covers during severe frost to gather the vegetables as they are wanted, but of course the pit is covered up again imme- diately after.

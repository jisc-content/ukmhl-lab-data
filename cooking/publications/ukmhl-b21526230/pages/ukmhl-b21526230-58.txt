THE FRUGAL 50 set with alum. The colour is reckoned better when boiled in brass, instead of iron. The purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colours for stockings; and it is an economical plan, after they have been mended and cut down, so that they will no longer look decent, to colour old stockings, and make them up for children. A pailful of lye, with a piece of copperas half as big as a hen’s egg boiled in it, will make a fine nankin colour, which will never wash out. This is very useful for the linings of bed-quilts, comforters, &c. Old faded gowns, coloured in this way, may be made into good petticoats. Cheap cotton cloth may be coloured to advantage for petticoats, and pelisses for little girls. A very beautiful nankin colour may likewise be obtained from birch-bark, set with alum. The bark should be covered with water, and boiled thoroughly in brass or tin. A bit of alum half as big as a hen’s egg is sufficient. If copperas be used instead of alum, slate colour will be pro- duced. Tea-grounds boiled in iron, and set with cop- peras, make a very good slate colour. Log-wood and cider, in iron, set with copperas, makes a good black. Rusty nails, or any rusty iron, boiled in vinegar, with a small bit of cop- peras, makes a good black,—black ink-powder done in the same way answers the same purpose.

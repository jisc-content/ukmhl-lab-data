THE FRUGAL 58 usually costs about four-pence the pound. It is good tor roasting, and particularly for corning and salting. The navel end of the brisket is one ot the best pieces for salting or corning, and is very good for roasting. A bullockâ€™s heart is very profitable to use as a steak. Broiled just like beef. There are usually five pounds in a heart, and it can be bought for about two shillings. Some people stuff and roast it. The chuck, between the neck and the shoulder, is a very good piece for roasting, for steaks, or for salting. Indeed, it is good for almost any- thing ; and is cheap. The richest, tenderest, and most delicate piece of beef for roasting, or for steak, is the rump and the last cut of the sirloin. It is peculiarly ap- propriate for an invalid, as it is lighter food than any other beef. But if economy be consulted instead of luxury, the round will be bought in preference to the rump. It is heartier food, and of course less can be eaten; and it is cheaper in price. The shoulder of veal is the most economical for roasting or boiling. It is always cheap, let veal bear what price it may. Two dinners may be made from it; the shoulder roasted, and the knuckle cut off to be boiled with a bit of pork and greens, or to be made into soup. The breast of veal is a favourite piece, and is sold high.

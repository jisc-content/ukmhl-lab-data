One ounce of gentian root sliced, one ounce of fresh rind of lemon, two drachms of cardamomum seeds bruised, three drachms of Seville orange- peel; pour a pint and a half of boiling water over the ingredients, let it stand an hour closely covered, then decant the clear liquor, and take a wine glass full two or three times a day.

A teaspoonful in half a pint of water-gruel, taken the last thing at night, says Dr. Kitchiner, is a most effectual medicine to remove coughs and colds. He adds, it is also excellent for children who have the hooping cough, in doses of from five to twenty drops in a little water. FOR A COUGH. One drachm of aromatic spice; one drachm and a half of spirits of lavender; two ounces of sirup of orange-peel; made into an electuary. A tea- spoonful to be taken when the cough is trouble- some.

FAMILY RECEIPTS, ETC. TINCTURE OF RHUBARB. Put into a stone bottle a gallon of the best brandy, to which add rhubarb, two ounces ; raisins, stoned, one pound; senna, coriander seed, cardamomura seed, fennel seed, of each half an ounce; cochineal, a quarter of an ounce; saffron, two drachms; and stick licorice two ounces and a half; all well pounded; cork it lightly, and shake it twice a day for six weeks, then strain it off, and bottle it for use. N. B. A small quantity of the brandy may be reserved to wash the seeds, &c. after the straining. A VALUABLE STOMACHIC TINCTURE. Cascarilla bark bruised, and orange-peel dried, of each one ounce; brandy, or proof spirit, one pint: let the ingredients steep for a fortnight, and decant the clear liquor. Take two or three teaspoonfuls in a wine glass of water twice a day. This is a sovereign remedy to strengthen the stomach; and in most nervous and languid chronic complaints of that organ, will be taken with the greatest advantage.

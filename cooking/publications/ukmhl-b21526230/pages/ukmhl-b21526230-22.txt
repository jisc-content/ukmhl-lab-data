14 THE FRUGAL should not be packed away in bags when they are first plucked. They should be laid lightly in a basket, or something of that kind, and stirred up often. The garret is the best place to dry them, because they will there be kept free from dirt and moisture, and will be in no danger of being blown away. It is well to put the parcels, which you may have from time to time, into the oven, after you have removed your bread, and let them stand a day. If feather-beds smell badly, or become heavy, from want of proper preservation of the feathers, or from old age, empty them, and wash the feathers thoroughly in a tub of suds; spread them in your garret to dry, and they will be as light and as good as new. Jamaica rum, constantly used to wash the hair, keeps it very clean, and free from disease, and promotes its growth a great deal more than Macassar oil. Brandy is very strengthening to the roots of the hair; but it has a hot drying tendency, which rum has not. If you wish to preserve fine teeth, always clean them thoroughly after you have eaten your last meal at night. Rags should never be thrown away because they are dirty. Mop rags, lamp rags, &c. should be washed, dried, and put into the rag bag. There is no need of expending soap upon them : boil them out in dirty suds, after you have done washing.

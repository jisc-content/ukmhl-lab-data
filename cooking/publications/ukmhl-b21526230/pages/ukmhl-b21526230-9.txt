THE FRUGAL HOUSEWIFE. INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER, The true economy of housekeeping is simply the art of gathering up all the fragments, so that nothing be lost. I mean fragments of time, as well as materials. Nothing should be thrown away so long as it is possible to make any use of it, however trifling that use may be; and what- ever be the size of a family, every member should be employed either in earning or saving money. “ Time is money.” For this reason, cheap as stockings are, it is good economy to knit them. Cotton and woollen yarn are both cheap; hose that are knit wear twice as long as woven ones; and they can be done at odd minutes of time, which would not be otherwise employed. Where there arc children, or aged people, it is sufficient to recommend knitting, that it is an employment. In this point of view, patchwork is good eco- nomy. It is indeed a foolish waste of time to tear cloth into bits for the sake of arranging it anew in fantastic figures; but a large family may be kept out of idleness, and a few shillings saved, by thus using scraps of gowns, curtains, &c.

HOUSEWIFE. 01 a pint of cider, one teaspoonful of pearlash; spice to your taste. Bake till it turns easily in the pans. 1 should think about half an hour. ELECTION CAKE. Old-fashioned election cake is made of four pounds of flour; three quarters of a pound of butter; four eggs; one pound of sugar; one pound of currants, or raisins if you choose; half a pint of good yeast; wet it^with milk as soft as it can be and be moulded on a board. Set to rise over night in winter : in warm weather, three hours is usually enough for it to rise. A loaf, the size of common flour bread, should bake three quarters of an hour. SPONGE CAKE. The nicest way to make sponge cake, or diet bread, is the weight of six eggs in sugar, the weight of four eggs in flour, a little rose-water. The whites and yolks should be beaten tho- roughly and separately. The eggs and sugar should be well beaten together; but after the flour is sprinkled, it should not be stirred a mo- ment longer than is necessary to mix it well; it should be poured into the pan, and got into the oven with all possible expedition. Twenty mi- nutes is about long enough to bake. Not to be put in till some other articles have taken off the lirst few minutes of furious heat.

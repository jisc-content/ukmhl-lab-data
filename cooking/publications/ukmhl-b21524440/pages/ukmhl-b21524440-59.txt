SOUPS CHAP. II 45 those for whom the dish is cooked. Never use black pepper for white soup. The Stockpot.—This is a great help to a cook in preparing vegetable soups, gravies, and sauces. Put into a pan all odd pieces of meat, cooked or uncooked, provided they are good and untainted, bones, chopped small, necks, etc., of fowls. Cover with plenty of water, and let it simmer slowly but steadily by the side of the fire. The liquor in which meat or poultry has been boiled may be used instead of water. The stockpot should be cleared out thoroughly, once a week in winter, and more frequently in summer. Nothing need be wasted or thrown away, unless it is unfit for human food. General Directions for preparing Stock for Soup.—Stock for soup should always be made a day before it is wanted for use, to allow the fat to rise and form a cake on the surface. This must be carefully taken off before the stock is used.1 Any part of the ox will make good soup; the head, shin, neck, and tail are the parts usually chosen for this purpose. In preparing stock for soup, begin by cutting the meat into small pieces, and breaking up the bones, if there are any. Carefully wash and peel the vegetables (see “ To Cleanse Vegetables,” p. 33), cut them into thick pieces, and tie up the herbs in muslin. Put the meat and vegetables with the water into a large saucepan, and let the stock simvier gently. Stock should never boil fast. A gentle heat extracts the nourishing juices from the meat, and the flavour from the vegetables. The cover of the pan must fit very closely to prevent evaporation. Any scum that rises to the surface while the stock is cooking should be carefully taken off. The meat prepared in the same way may be put with the vegetables and water 1 The fat can be used for frying (see “Clarified Fat,” p. 132).

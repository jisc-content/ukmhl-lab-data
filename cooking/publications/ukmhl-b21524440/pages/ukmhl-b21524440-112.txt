98 PART II MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK Melt the butter in a small pan; stir in the flour; when the flour and butter are well mixed, add by degrees the stock or milk. Stir well until the sauce is sufficiently boiled, which will be in about five minutes; it should come away from the sides of the pan, leaving it clean. Mix the meat, parsley, lemon, salt, and pepper with the bread crumbs; add them to the sauce; mix- well, and set the mixture aside to cool. Slightly beat up the egg on a plate; put some bread crumbs into a sheet of paper; divide the mixed meat and crumbs, when cold, into pieces ; make the pieces into balls ; roll them in flour; dip each ball into the beaten egg; toss it in the bread crumbs, and fry a golden brown in clarified fat. Drain, when cooked, on kitchen paper, and serve at once on a folded napkin or arranged neatly on a dish. Cold meat of any kind can be used in this way; cold chicken and veal should have a little cooked ham or bacon added to the meat. The butter and flour can be omitted, and an egg used instead, to bind the mixture. Onion, mushroom, herbs, etc., can be used to vary the flavour. Boiled rice or mashed potatoes may take the place of bread crumbs. Macaroni and Cheese Croquettes 3 oz.

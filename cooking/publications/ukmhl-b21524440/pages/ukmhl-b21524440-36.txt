PART i 22 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK as gruel, oatmeal drink tea (not coffee, as it checks perspiration). Beef Tea is of much value during most severe ill- nesses, as patients can often take it when nothing else is acceptable. It is, however, not sufficient alone to sustain strength for any length of time; it is only one part of meat, and unless the fibre of meat (or some other flesh-forming food corresponding to meat) and warmth-giving food are given soon, the patient will suffer from partial starvation. The same remarks apply to ox or calf’s foot jelly. Tea is useful in a sick room when properly made and used, and is preferable to coffee. It should never be given in the evening or at night, as it prevents sleep, but a cup of tea early in the morning is generally most refreshing to a restless or suffering person.

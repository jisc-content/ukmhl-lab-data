PUDDINGS CHAP. XIII 157 Chop the suet fine (see “Suet Crust,” p. 154); add it with the salt to the flour ; mix them well together iu a bowl; add the water, mixing all together with a wooden spoon. Some kinds of flour require more and some less water than the quantity given above. It is better to mix in the water gradually, to avoid spoiling the pudding by using too much. Prepare a pudding- basin ; put in the mixture ; tie a cloth (see “ Pudding- Cloth,” p. 156) over; plunge the pudding into boiling water, and boil for two hours. This pudding is better steamed (see “To Steam Puddings,” p. 137). An egg makes the pudding richer. This pudding is lighter if made with ^ lb. bread crumbs and ^ lb. flour. Chop the suet fine; mix it with the bread crumbs (see “Bread Crumbs,” p. 133), flour, and sugar in a bowl. Grate the rind of the lemons; squeeze out the juice and strain it. Beat up the eggs; add them with the grated lemon rind and juice to the contents of the bowl; mix all well together. Put the mixture into a Prepared basin, cover with a buttered paper, and steam the pudding for two and a half hours. Serve with melted butter sauce. Apple Dumplings Peel, but do not divide the apples ; cut out the core ; fill up the hole left in the middle of the apple with sugar, and a clove, if liked. Make a crust with suet (see “Suet Crust,” p. 154); roll it out evenly; cut it into as many pieces as there arc apples. Put an apple on each piece of crust, cover the apple completely over, and put the dumplings into a saucepan of boiling Lemon Pudding J lb. Flour 4 „ Bread Crumbs | ,, Castor Sugar 2 Eggs I lb.

POULTRY 85 CHAP. V CHAPTER V POULTRY Roast Fowl When the fowl has been properly trussed (see “To Truss a Fowl for Roasting,” p. 135), put it to roast before a bright fire for three-quarters of an hour. Baste it well with good dripping; about a quarter of an hour before it is done dredge a little flour over it, as for roast meat (see p. 35). Serve with bread sauce (see “ Sauces,” p. 127) and sausages or bacon. A large fowl will take an hour to roast. Stuffed Fowl Make a forcemeat as directed for “ Roast Veal,” p. 81, and fill the breast of the fowl with it. Roast as above. Boiled Fowl Butter a piece of kitchen paper and fold the fowl in it. Put the fowl into a saucepan, and cover it well with boiling water; add one teaspoonful of salt; boil slowly for an hour, or an hour and a half, according to the age of the fowl. Take it from the pan without pricking it with a fork ; remove the paper ; let the fowl stand for a minute or two ; place it on a dish, and cover with egg sauce, or white sauce, or parsley and butter (see “Sauces,” pp. 124-127). Serve with boiled pork or bacon. Roast Duck 1 Duck 3 Largo Onions 7 or 8 Sago Loaves 3 oz.

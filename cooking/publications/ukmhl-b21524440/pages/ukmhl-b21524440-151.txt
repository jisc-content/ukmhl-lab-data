CHAP. X MISCELLANEOUS 137 delicate cakes, turn the mould after it is buttered over on a plate ; let it drain. If the cake is to be of a brown colour, sprinkle a little castor sugar into the mould; turn it over, and shake out the loose sugar. To Prepare Basins or Moulds for Puddings Dip a piece of folded kitchen paper in soft butter ; rub it over every part of the basin or mould till it is well covered. Be careful to prepare in the same way the paper for covering steamed puddings. To Steam Puddings All kinds of puddings are lighter when steamed than when boiled. Cover the basin or mould contain- ing the pudding with a piece of well-buttered kitchen paper; put it into a saucepan, which must have boiling water in it, enough to come within an inch of the rim of the basin or mould. If there is more water, it may, when boiling'fast, spoil the pudding by flowing over the sides of the basin; as the water boils away, add more boiling water. It is well to put a small pan of water on the fire soon after the pudding is put into the sauce- pan, to be ready when required to fill up the pan. Puddings take longer to cook when steamed than when covered with boiling water, half an hour, or an hour, according to the kind of pudding. When done, the pan can be moved to one side without injury to the pudding, if the fire is needed for preparing another dish. The difficulty of lifting the basin from the pan without burning the fingers is overcome by placing the pudding on a small drainer before putting it in the saucepan.

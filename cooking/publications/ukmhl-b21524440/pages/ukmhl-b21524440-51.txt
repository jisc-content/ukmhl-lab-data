GENERAL DIRECTIONS CHAr. I 37 tender. Be careful to put the fork into the fat or skin. If you pierce the lean, you will allow the juices to escape. If tongs are used, do not squeeze the meat. The length of time required depends chiefly on the thickness of the meat to be cooked. A separate gridiron should, if pos- sible,be kept for fish. When the top of the fire cannot be used (as in close rauges), suspend a hanging gridiron in front of the fire with the meat between the two halves of the gridiron, which must be turned with the meat. Boiling Meat covered with water and cooked in it is said to be boiled, but it must not be supposed that the water should be kept at boiling point. Plunge the meat into boiling water (212° Pahr.), enough to cover it. This hardens the outside, and keeps in the juices. After the water (cooled by the meat) again comes to the boil, let it remain boiling for about 5 minutes, then skim carefully, and add cold water, or move the pot to a less hot place, till the water simmers. Tested by thermometer, there is little difl'erence between the heat of boiling and of simmering. The difference of the result of the two methods of cooking is very great indeed, and appears to be due to the different rates atwhich the heat is communicated to the food. Meat boiled is meat spoiled— it must be simmered slowly to be properly cooked. Draw the pot aside, keep it simmering till the meat is cooked, allowing a of an hour to each pound, counting from the time the water begins to boil, and ^ of an hour over. If it is a large piece of meat, allow an hour over. Add a little salt when the meat is nearly ready. For salt meat or pork allow 20 minutes to each pound. Salt meat is put on with cold water. For fish allow 10 minutes to the pound, and, when thick, 10 minutes over. Green vegetables should be boiled briskly and If I i, f; • •• .

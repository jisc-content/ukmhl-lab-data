64 PART 11 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK onion mixed with bread crumbs, and a small piece of butter before they are rolled. Chop the meat of the lobster rather fine; if there is any coral, pound it with 1 oz. of butter, and press it through a sieve; add it to the sauce. Put the butter into a saucepan; let it melt; add the flour, stir it smooth, but do not let it brown. Add a quarter of a pint of cold water gradually, stirring all the time, till the sauce boils; take it from the fire, add the coral, pepper, and salt, and if cream is used, a tablespoonful of cream. Mix the chopped lobster with the sauce, spread it on a plate to cool, before making it into cutlets. Break an egg on to a plate, beat it slightly with a knife. When the lobster is cool, take a small quantity and shape it as much like a cutlet as possible, on a lightly floured board. Put some very fine bread crumbs into a sheet of kitchen paper; dip each cutlet into the egg, covering it well over; put the egged cutlet into the crumbs, toss them well over it; shake off any loose crumbs, and press a knife over the cutlets to press the crumbs well down before frying. Have ready a pan of boiling fat,1 put the cutlets into the frying basket, plunge it in the fat, and fry a golden brown. Take out the cutlets, put them on kitchen paper to drain ; take pieces of the antennae (feelers) of the lobster and stick a piece into each cutlet to imitate a bone. Milk can be used instead of water for the sauce. Lobster Cutlets 1 Lobster 1 oz.

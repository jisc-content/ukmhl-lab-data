MEAT 75 CHAP. IV let it boil for a few minutes; put the pieces of tail on a dish, strain the gravy over, adding the lemon juice just before straining. Garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread, and slices of lemon cut into halves. Cook according to “General Directions for Roasting,” p. 34. Mint sauce (see p. 128) should be served with roast lamb. If the joint is a forequarter, have a hot dish at hand, ready for the shoulder, when the carver has divided the joint. Put the bacon into a stewpan with the onion (into which two or three cloves may be stuck if the flavour is liked), the peppercorns, herbs, sugar, and salt. Put in the lamb; pour over sufficient water or weak stock to cover it. Let it simmer gently for an hour or an hour and a half. Boil a pint of green peas (see “Peas,” p. 121). When the lamb is ready, take it from the pan, remove the onion and herbs from the gravy, add the peas, put the meat on a dish, and pour the gravy and peas round it. If the peas are boiled with the meat, they lose their green colour. This dish may be varied by using rice instead of peas. Take the best end of the neck with the bones not cracked. Saw off the flat bone at the end, and divide the neck into cutlets. Cut off most of the fat, and all the skin ; scrape the bone at the top of each cutlet quite Roast Lamb Stewed Lamb 2 lbs. of Breast of Lamb 3 Slices of Bacon 1 Onion Water or Stock Bunch of Sweet Herbs 10 Peppercorns 1 Teaspoonful Castor Sugar i ,, Salt Lamb Cutlets

Broiled Mutton Chops See “ To Broil,” p. 36. Tomatoes cooked in various ways may be served with chops, as a purde round the meat, or baked and sent to table in a separate dish, or as a sauce (see p. 123). For Chops a la Maitre d’Hotel, mix 1 oz. of butter with 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a pinch of pepper, one of salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice. When well mixed, lay pieces on the chops.

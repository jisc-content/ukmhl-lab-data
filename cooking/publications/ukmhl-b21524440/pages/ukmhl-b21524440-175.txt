CHAP. XIII 161 PUDDINGS water in the saucepan must be boiling before the pudding is put in, and must continue to boil the whole time, till the pudding is taken out. A Lancashire Roly-poly 2 Apples 2 Tablespoonfuls Golden Syrup 2 oz. Currants Spice, if liked, and Grated Lemon Rind Mince the apples very fine, spread them with the currants on to the crust, and add the golden syrup,1 or treacle, if preferred. Roll up the crust as directed for the jam roly-poly, being very careful to close the edges firmly. Boil for one hour and a half. Rolled Currant Pudding Proceed as for jam roly-poly, using dried currants in- stead of jam, and adding a small quantity of sugar. J lb.

I his pudding may be divided into two ; half may be boiled for four hours, and put aside till required, when it must be boiled again for two more hours.

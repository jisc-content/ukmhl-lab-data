PASTRY 151 CHAP. XII Beat the butter to a cream (see p. 139); whisk the eggs for twenty minutes, adding the sugar gradually to the eggs while whisking; add the butter; stir in the flour; mix it well in, add the flavouring. Bake in well-buttered tins for twenty minutes ; spread jam be- tween. The quantity of flour, butter, and sugar required is equal to the weight of the two eggs used. Fruit Tart or Pie Before beginning to make the pastry, see that all the materials are at hand. Weigh out the quantities re- quired.

Ornament the edge by placing the thumb on the edge of the pastry, and drawing the back of a knife quickly up against the double layer of

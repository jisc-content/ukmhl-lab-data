PART I 2 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK need to replace brain tissue, and workers use up bone and muscle tissue; and both thinkers and workers are prompted (in health) by the feeling called hunger, to obtain fresh supplies of material to replace the brain and muscle tissue, and these supplies are termed food. And even in cases where very little work is done, and a very small amount of exercise is taken, there is still a demand for a lesser supply of food, for work is continually beiug done in the animal body, quite irre- spective of anything done voluntarily. For example, animals are continually breathing, their hearts are always beating, their blood is always circulating, and in the case of human animals the brain is continually at work suggesting thoughts and feelings; and, in short, a great deal of work is done in the body, and a great deal of tissue is consumed without there being any con- sciousness of it. Nevertheless, the consumed tissue re- quires to be replaced by food, and the animal economy is seriously deranged if the food supply is improperly managed. Hence we find that to keep the body in health, the food must contain matter that will build up brain, bone, flesh, and every other part. The chilliness of half-fed people and animals is familiarly known, as well as the lowered mental and bodily power induced by contiuued cold. Hence we see that warmth is essential to the health of the bod}’, and that food helps to keep up the animal heat.1 Food, then, must make up for loss of body tissue, and must supply heat, and it is a matter of great 1 The temperature of the human body is about 98° Fahr., and iu healthy persons is nearly uniform both in hot and in cold weather. Thermometers, instruments for measuring heat, have been constructed by various persons ; the one made by Fahrenheit is the one commonly used in England. On this, freezing point is 32° (° means degrees) ; temperate, 55° ; summer heat, 76°; blood heat, 93°; boiling point (water), 212°. Boiling point of oil, 600°

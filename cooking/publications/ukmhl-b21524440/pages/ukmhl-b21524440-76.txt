PART II MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK 62 Broiled Mackerel Split the fish up the back, clean and wipe, but do not wash it. Lay it flat on the gridiron, and broil according to the “ General Directions ” (p. 36). When cooked, lay it on a hot dish, put a small piece of butter on it, and a sprinkle of pepper and salt. Serve very hot. Any fish may be broiled in this way. Clean and skin the haddock, cut the flesh down close to the bone. Lay it flat on a board, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and put a piece of butter on it. Fold it over. Bake in a buttered1 tin for about ten minutes, with pieces of butter over it, and a buttered paper laid over. Serve with white sauce poured over it. Put a sprig of parsley, the piece of onion, and about a quarter of the rind of the lemon with the spices and salt into a stewpan. Wash and dry the fish and place it in the stewpan with cream, or milk enough to nearly cover it. Put on the lid, and let the fish simmer gently for about quarter of an hour. Mis the flour to a paste with a little cold milk. When the fish is sufficiently cooked, take it from the pan, and keep it hot. Add the flour to the cream or milk in which the cod has been cooked. Let it boil up, stir- ring the flour in. Add pepper and salt if required. Beat up the yolk of the egg in a basin, pour the sauce to the egg, stirring carefully all the time.

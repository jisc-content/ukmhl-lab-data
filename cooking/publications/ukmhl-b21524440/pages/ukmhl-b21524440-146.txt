Bring the water to the boil, stirring occasionally ; carefully remove any scum that rises. Then let it boil quickly, with the lid off the pan, till the liquid is a clear oil, which shows that the water has passed off in steam. So long as the liquid has a milky look, the water has not all passed off, and the fat. if used for frying, would fly up when heated. Clarified fat generally requires to boil from one to two hours. Draw the pan aside to let the fat go on melting, until the pieces are crisp and begin to brown; then let the fat cool a little) strain it through a strainer into a basin, pressing any pieces that are left to extract all the oil. When cold, the fat should be quite white. In straining the fat it must be remembered that it is much hotter than boiling water (see note on p. 2). The heat is so great indeed, that, if poured through a soldered strainer, it might melt the solder. It is because of this intense heat that food is so quickly cooked when fried, as directed on p. 39. For cooking, the fat does not actually boil. To Clarify Dripping The same dripping or clarified fat may be used for a very long time for frying. When it becomes brown and mixed with sediment, place it in an iron pan; let it

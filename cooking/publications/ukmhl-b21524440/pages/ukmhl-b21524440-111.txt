When brown, add the stock, ketchup, and sauce ; cover the pan; let the kidneys simmer for half an hour, or longer. Serve on toasted bread, or with fried bacon. Well wash the kidney; peel off its outer skin; split it lengthwise into two; put it in a basin of boiling water for three minutes; let it drain, then dry it. Put half the flour on to a plate; mix in the pepper and salt; toss each piece of kidney in the flour. Scrape the carrot, peel the turnip and onion ; put them into a stewpan with the kidney; nearly cover with water or stock, and let all stew for two and a half hours. When cooked, take out the vegetables; chop about half of them into very small pieces; cut out the middle of the kidneys neatly; fill up the space with the chopped vegetable, and place the kidneys on two slices of toast.. Make the gravy, by stirring the butter into the remainder of the flour over the fire in a small pan, adding some of the liquor in which the kidneys have been cooked; pepper and salt, if needed. When the gravy has boiled, add a teaspoonful of ketchup ; strain the gravy, and pour it neatly round the kidney. Stewed Beef Kidney 4 Kidney ^ Carrot \ Turnip \ Spanish Onion ^ oz.

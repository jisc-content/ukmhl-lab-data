VI PREFACE production of other dishes, which the size and cost of this little hook render it impossible to print in full. No young cook needs to suppose that she can- not make a certain pudding, etc., merely because she has less milk, suet, etc., than is mentioned in the recipe. If she will remember to use the half of every one of the ingredients (in other words, preserve the proportions of each of the in- gredients), the pudding will be correct as to taste, though, of course, smaller in size than was pro- posed. In Lancashire, the mistake of using the popular instead of the Imperial Gill measure often leads to the result of thin watery sauces, puddings, etc. The Imperial Gill, quoted in the recipes, is half the size of the popular one. A cookery book cannot be made as clear and inflexible as a mathematical proposition; and there are some things, such as beating up the whites of eggs, making pastry, clearing soup and jelly, regulating the heat of the oven, etc., eta, which can neither be taught by book, nor by watching another person, but only by taking practical lessons in the art. No recipes for corn flour preparations are given, as they are usually printed upon each packet.

MEAT CHAP. IV 73 Beef Steak Pudding Suet Crust, p. 154 1 lb. Steak 2 Sheep’s Kidneys 4 oz. Flour | Teaspoonful Salt I ,, Pepper Line a pudding basin neatly with suet crust, rolled out to the thickness of a little over a quarter of an inch ; cut off the paste round the rim of the basin ; roll out the pieces to a size a little larger than the top of the basin, to form a cover. Mix the flour, pepper, and salt together in a plate; cut the meat slantwise into slices ; dip each slice into the flour on the plate; cut the fat of the steak into small pieces; lay a piece on each slice of meat; roll the meat up, and lay it lightly in the lined pudding basin. Cut the kidney into small pieces, dip them in the flour, and add them to the meat. Pour two tablespoonfuls of water over the meat. Wet the edge of the paste; put the cover on; press the edges of the paste together so as to close them well. Dip a pudding cloth into boiling water, press the water out, and flour the middle of the cloth. Put this part over the pudding; tie the cloth round the basin below the rim with a piece of string; gather up the corners of the cloth and tie them together on the top of the pudding. Plunge the basin into boiling water; let it boil for two hours. When the pudding is ready, take it from the pan; remove the cloth; let the pudding stand for a minute or two, then give the basin a shake to loosen the pudding; turn it out on to a hot dish. Have, ready a little hot stock (see “ Stockpot,” p. 45), pour it round the dish, and serve the pudding. If liked, a little chopped onion, two or three cloves, or a small quantity of thyme can be added to the meat before the cover of the pudding is put on. Mush- rooms are a great improvement to the flavour. The kidney can be left out, or beef kidney used instead.

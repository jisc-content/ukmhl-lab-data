MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART I] 152 pastry at short distances. . With a paste-cutter, cut out leaves or any fancy shape from the remains of the paste and decorate the tart with them. If left plain, sprinkle castor sugar over before serving (see “ Baking,” p. 40). Roll the paste out into a square, about a quarter of an inch in thickness (either short crust or rough puf! paste); with a round tin paste-cutter, cut out rounds of a size to fit the patty-pans; fit a round of paste into each patty-pan ; half fill with jam. From the pieces of paste left from cutting the rounds, cut thin strips ; twist them ; lay four across each tartlet, crossing each other in a network. Bake for twenty minutes (see “ Baking,” p. 40). It is a good way of using up the paste left after covering a pie, to make it into tartlets or cheese- cakes. Put the scraps of paste one on the other, and roll out into a square. Make half the quantity of pastry given on p. 149 ; roll it out to the thickness of a quarter of an inch ; line three or four small deep tins with the paste. Beat up the egg with the sugar; add the milk and lemon peel; fill the lined tins nearly full with the custard ; sprinkle a little of the nutmeg over; bake for twenty minutes, or till the custard is set. These pies can be eaten hot or cold. The custard can be put into a small pie-dish lined with the paste, instead of small tins ; lay a double strip of paste on the rim of the dish, and ornament the edge, as directed for a fruit tart.

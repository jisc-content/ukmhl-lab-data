CHA1-. I A WELL-COOKED MEAL 43 1. Begin to arrange the dinner several hours before it is to be eaten. 2. See that the fire is made up, and the oven (if you are going to bake) is getting heated before you begin. 3. Arrange the various saucepans, etc., that will be required, ready for use. 4-. If you always put away the paDS thoroughly clean, and turned downwards, you find them clean and reacly for use when needed. 5. Dust or thoroughly rinse each article that may have gathered dustâ€”for instance, gravy strainers, etc. 6. Have plenty of hot and cold water ready. 7. Have the tins, or moulds, or basins ready buttered before you mix the puddings. 8. Have a kitchen cloth tucked into the belt of your apron, so that you may lift a pan without soiling your hands, by holding the handle with the cloth round it. 9. Weigh out all the materials before beginning to mix; also clean any currants that are required. 10. When you lift a saucepan lid to test the progress of the cooking, do not put it down in such a way on the bar, that the smoke fills the lid; if you do, the pudding, etc., will taste smoky, and will probably have smuts upon it. 11. In preparing the simplest dinner, always calcu- late beforehand how many pans will need to be upon the fire at once. Small fireplaces usually accommodate three or four pans, but if you have to roast a joint and prepare gravy, and sauce for a vegetable, and also boil two vegetables, and a pudding, you must so arrange that the five pans go on the fire in turn, and keep hot and slowly cooking by the side. 12. Be sure and have the dishes and plates warm,

Break the bread into small pieces; put it into the stock, which must be cold; let it come to the boil; add the other ingredients gradually, so as not to cool the liquid. Boil slowly for about one hour and a half, until the vegetables are soft. Rub the soup through a colander or sieve to make it quite smooth. Heat again and serve. Any other vegetables that are in season may be used instead of those mentioned. The soup may be made richer by putting the well-beaten yolk of an egg into the tureen, and stirring the soup gradually in with it. Wash the barley well; clean, and divide the carrot across. Cut half of it into small pieces with the turnip and leeks. Put the meat into a saucepan with enough cold water to cover it; bring it to the boil; add the barley and vegetables gradually, with the pepper and salt; let all simmer gently for three hours. Grate the remainder of the carrot, and add it to the broth an hour before serving. Take out the meat; place it in a hot dish ; serve the broth with the barley and vegetables in a tureen.

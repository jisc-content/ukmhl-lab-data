For this purpose let us consider one or two of our most important foods. Milk is a perfect human food, and infants live on it alone. We find that if milk stands for a short time, the cream or fatty part separates and rises to the top, leav- ing the skim milk below. The cream is the principal part which gives warmth, but it does not repair the used-up materials of the body. The skim milk does this. Skim milk can be separated into curd and whey.

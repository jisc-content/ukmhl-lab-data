MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 196 applying it to the patient. To mix the poultice, have two basins made hot; leave the hot water in one, and warm the spatula (or broad kuife) in it. Into the hot empty basin pour about the third of a pint of boiling water. Sprinkle the linseed in with one hand, and stir briskly with the spatula, until the mixture no longer permits the linseed to sink. Continue to stir or beat it for a minute, and then turn it out on a piece of linen (or tow previously flattened out). Spread it evenly with the spatula or broad knife, dipping the blade into the hot water, to enable it to spread the poultice evenly, about half an inch thick. Be careful to leave a margin of an inch all round the linen (or tow) ; and when the poultice is smoothly spread, turn up this edge all round. This keeps the loose bits from dropping out as the poultice dries, and thus prevents irritation to the patient. A little salad oil spread over the sur- face makes the poultice comfortable to the skin. Fold the poultice iu two (if properly made, it will not stick together), place it between the hot plates and carry it to the bedside. Care should be taken to prevent a chill when the poultices are changed ; and when they are discontinued, a piece of cotton wool should be placed over the tender moistened skin. Mustard and Linseed Poultice Mix two tablespoonfuls of mustard in the water before stirring in the linseed. Be very careful that all the mustard is perfectly mixed, and that there are no lumps. Charcoal and Linseed Poultice Use charcoal instead of mustard, as in foregoing recipe. When the poultice is ready, sprinkle a little charcoal on the surface before applying it to the patient

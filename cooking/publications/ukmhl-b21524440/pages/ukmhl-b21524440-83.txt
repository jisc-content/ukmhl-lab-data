Mackerel can be baked in the oven as directed for herrings (see “Baked Herrings,” p. 63). Put the fish to soak in cold water the night before it is used, with a few spoonfuls of vinegar. Put it into the fish kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it; let it come to the boil very gradually. Then let it simmer for about fifteen minutes. Serve with egg sauce. Cook according to “General Directions for Roasting,” p. 34. Garnish with scraped horse-radish, arranged in heaps round the dish; serve Yorkshire pudding (see p. 170) with the roast. A sauce made with grated horse-radish (see “Horse-radish Sauce,” p. 127) is the proper accompaniment to roast beef.

SALADS 147 CHAP. XI 1 Hard-boiled Egg 3 Tablespoonfuls Salad Oil 2 Salad Dressing, No. 1 1 Small Teaspoonful Made Mustard | Small Teaspoouful Sugar Vinegar Pinch of Salt The oil used in preparing dressing for salads should be the best olive oil, free from any rancid smell or taste. The reason why so many people dislike oil in salad is, that it too frequently has a strong, disagreeable taste. Good oil is both wholesome and agreeable. Malt vinegar is the best for salads ; if white vinegar is used, a less quantity than that given is required. Put the yolk of the egg into a basin ; rub it with a wooden spoon to a smooth paste; mix the salt, sugar, and mustard with it; add the oil gradually, stirring it well to the other ingredients ; pour in the vinegar gradually, mix all smoothly together. The white of the egg, cut into neat pieces, is used to decorate the salad.

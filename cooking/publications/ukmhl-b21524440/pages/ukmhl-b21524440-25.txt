chap, ii THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY 11 the daily diet, and that variety of food is essential to health. A second important lesson is, that food which will form flesh is to be found not only in milk, eggs, and butchers’ meat, but also in vegetable lood ; especially in pulses and in grains (wheat, barley, oats, etc.), and this food, in these pulses and grains, costs less than the same kind of food when bought in the form of meat, poultry, etc. CHAPTER II THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY Food is cooked that it may be made acceptable to the taste, and digestible. The chief modes of cooking are roasting, broiling, boiling, stewing, baking, and frying. Of these modes, boiling is the most digestible; roasting the most nutri- tious ; stewing the most economical. In this chapter we shall treat of foods as commonly known, viz animal food (including milk and eggs) and vegetable food. These require very different management in cooking. Two general rules may be laid down— 1. Meat, milk, and eggs should be cooked at a moderate heat (about 160° Fahr.) 2.

Animal Food.—Every one knows that when an egg is boiled for four minutes, the white becomes quite solid. The material of which white of egg consists is called albumen. Similar substances exist largely in milk, in fish, and in lean meat, but not in fat. If milk is cooked at boiling point, this substance turns into a

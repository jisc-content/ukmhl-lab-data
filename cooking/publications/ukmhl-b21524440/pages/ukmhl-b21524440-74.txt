60 PART II MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK into a pan or fish kettle with cold water, of which there should be sufficient to cover it completely. Salt, in the proportion of 1 oz. of salt to each quart of water, is added, and for flat fish, such as brill, a little vinegar; this makes the flesh firmer. Fish must never be allowed to boil fast; it must be boiled gently, or it is liable to break. The scum, which rises to the surface of the water while the fish is cooking, should be carefully removed. When done, the flesh separates easily from the bone. Allow eight or ten minutes to the pound after the water begins to boil, and if the fish is thick, ten minutes over. As soon as the fish is sufficiently cooked, it should be taken from the water and placed on a drainer. It should never be allowed to remain in the water after it is done, but if not wanted immediately, should be kept hot by covering it with a cloth and placing it on a dish over hot water. Slices of fish must be rubbed with salt and put into boiling water, then allowed to simmer gently. To Fry Fish Clean and dry the fish well. Break an egg on to a plate, beat it slightly, dip the fish into this, put some bread crumbs (see “Bread Crumbs,” p. 133) on a sheet of kitchen paper, and toss the egged fish in them, shake off the loose crumbs, and fry the fish (see “General Directions for Frying,” p. 39) in very hot clarified fat, a golden brown colour. To Bake Fish Haddock, mackerel, small codfish, etc., well cleaned, are filled with veal stuffing or other forcemeat, then sewn up with a large needle and fine string, put in a baking tin with butter or dripping, and baked iu the oven.

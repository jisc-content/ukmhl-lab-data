3 INTRODUCTION PART I interest to learn how the solid bread and meat that we eat is transformed within the body to the fluid form in which it is taken into the blood-vessels, and by them to the liver and lungs, where it is purified and fitted to be carried to all the organs to supply them with fresh material; while the requisite amount of heat is produced during its course by the chemical processes which are going on continually in the structure of every organ. The usefulness of food is entirely dependent upon its proper digestion, or assimilation to the body j and much of health and more of enjoyment depends upon the healthy performance of the work of digestion. Much care should be exercised as to the quantity of food taken at a time : neither, on the one hand, over- loading and distending the stomach with too large a quantity, nor, on the other hand, supplying food too small in bulk, or deficient in quality. To three other very important considerations three separate chapters will be devoted, viz.— 1. On the selection of the right materials, whether animal or vegetable, and on their use in proper pro- portions. 2. On cooking the materials in such a manner as to make them digestible—that is, capable of being readily turned into material fit for replacing the waste of the body already spoken of. 3. On adapting the use of food to the different cir- cumstances of age, employment, climate, and state of health.

MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 166 Break the pieces of bread, crust and crumb, into a basin ; put the milk into a saucepan; let it boil; stir in the butter ; when the butter is melted, pour the milk over the bread; cover the basin with a plate. Break the egg; beat it up with the sugar to a froth. With a fork beat up the bread till there are no lumps; add the egg and lemon peel; beat all well together. Prepare a basin or pudding-mould; pour iu the mixture; cover with a buttered paper; steam for an hour and a quarter. When cooked, turn the pudding out, and send it to table with jam, or syrup, or treacle, according to taste. This pudding can be varied in many ways, by adding 2 oz. of sultana raisins, or currants, or two spoonfuls of treacle, etc., or changing the flavour by using some essence instead of lemon peel. Crusts of bread, pieces left from bread cases, etc., are used up in this pudding. A little browned sugar stirred into the milk will disguise the colour of the crusts : and another egg and more butter make it richer. This pudding can be varied by being baked.

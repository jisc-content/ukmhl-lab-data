MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PAI'.T II ISO two tablespoonfuls of cold water; add them to the melted gelatine; whisk all together till the mixture begins to boil. Take out the whisk; let the jelly simmer for ten minutes ; remove it to the side of the fire ; let it stand for ten minutes. Pour boiling water through a tammis-cloth; then strain the jelly through the cloth into a basin. Dip a jelly-mould in cold water; drain it well; pour in the jelly, and leave it to set, in a cool place. If there is no tammis-cloth, a clean cloth tied over the legs of a kitchen chair, turned upside down on a table, answers very well for straining the jelly. Pour boiling water through the cloth before pouring the jelly; if the jelly is not clear after straining, pour it through the cloth a second time. Wine Jelly 1| oz.

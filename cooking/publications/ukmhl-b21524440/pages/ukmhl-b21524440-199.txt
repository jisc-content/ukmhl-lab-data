185 DISHES FOR INVALIDS chap, xvi disgust when ill. It is wiser, therefore, to omit the sugar from a pudding, etc., or to put in a very small quantity, and leave it to be added according to the patient’s taste. There is one point in the preparation and serving up of food for the sick-room that cannot be too often insisted upon, viz. the extreme cleanliness and neatness of all con- nected with it. No trace of fat should appear on the soup or broth ; no appearance of smoke on the milk, puddings, or toast.1 Every cup, plate, and glass, etc., should be bright to the eye and clean to the touch ; the gravy or sauce round the meat, etc., should never leave a mark on the edge of the dish. The table-linen should be spotless and free from creases, and the dishes made to look as dainty and tempting as possible. A large plateful of food should never be placed before an invalid, and it is better to make a small separate pudding, etc., for him, than to send up a piece cut from a large one. Half- emptied glasses and plates should never remain in the room ; even fruit should not be left within the constant sight of an invalid, on the plea that the sick person may “ fancy it by and by.” It must not be forgotten that food which has been long in the sick-room (especially in cases of infectious disease) becomes unwholesome and unfit for food. Potatoes and other vegetables should be simply and thoroughly cooked, and served without sauce, unless it is allowed by the doctor. Stewed Sweetbread J oz.

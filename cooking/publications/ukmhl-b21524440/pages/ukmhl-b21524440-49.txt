GENERAL DIRECTIONS 35 CHAP. I aii hour to each pound and one quarter of an hour over. If, however, the piece of meat is very thick, allow half an hour over. Young and white meat (veal, lamb, pork) require twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over. They are unwholesome when underdone. Sweep up the hearth, and make up a large fire in a well-polished fireplace an hour before it is wanted, so as to have it bright and glowing. Do not let the fire go down while the meat is roasting; add small pieces of coal or large cinders occasionally, so as to keep it up. Hang the meat by the small end to the hook of the jack. When there is no jack, the meat may be hooked to a skein of twisted worsted suspended from a hook projected from the mantelshelf. Wind up the jack, or twist the worsted, so as to make it spin slowly. Place the dripping pan under the joint. If you have a meat screen, see that the inside is bright (so as to throw back the heat upon the joint), and place it before the fire. Meat should be placed for the first ten minutes as near the fire as can be done without scorching, as the great heat hardens the outside, and keeps in the juices. Baste it as soon as the fat melts. Basting prevents the meat becoming dry and scorched. Then withdraw the meat 15 or 18 inches from the fire, and baste it fre- quently with the dripping produced by the melting of the fat. Much saving of weight and of flavour is effected by folding the meat in clean white paperâ€”with pieces of fat all round the meat or fowl, etc. Tie up the parcel and hang it on the roasting-jack by the string. Very little basting is required, because the fat melts gradually. A lean piece of meat should be basted with hot drip- ping melted for the purpose. The meat may be dredged with flour a quarter of an hour before it is quite ready, to make it browner and to thicken the gravy a little. When it is placed on a dish sprinkle it with a little salt. Before making sauce of the brown gravy, pour

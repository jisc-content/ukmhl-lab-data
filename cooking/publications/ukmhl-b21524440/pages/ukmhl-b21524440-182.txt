MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 168 Pancakes J lb. Flour 2 Eggs 2 oz. Castor Sugar £ Pint Milk \ Teaspoonful Salt £ lb. Clarified Fat or Lard Put the flour and salt in a basin; separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs; add the yolks to the flour, and stir well with a wooden spoon; pour in the milk gradually, stirring all the time; be careful to have no lumps in the batter. Put the whites of the eggs on a plate with a pinch of salt; beat to a stiff froth (see “To Beat Eggs,” p. 134); add this to the batter just before the pancakes are to be cooked, stir- ring it in lightly. This quantity of batter will make about eight pancakes. Divide the fat into eight pieces; put one piece into a small frying-pan to melt; put two and a half tablespoonfuls of the batter into a cup; when the fat in the pan is hot, pour in the batter from the cup, holding the pan so that the batter covers the bottom of it. Let the pancake set, then with a knife see that it does not stick anywhere. Shake it a little, and toss it over, or turn with a long thin knife. When a golden brown on both sides, put it on a hot dish, and roll it up, dredging a little sugar over. Cook the pan- cakes as quickly as possible, and serve very hot. Divide a lemon into quarters; cut each quarter in half ; put the pieces neatly on a plate ; send it to table with the pancakes, together with brown sugar, or castor sugar, according to taste. The batter is better if mixed some hours before it is used; the frothed white must not be put in till just before the batter is fried. Apple Fritters lb.

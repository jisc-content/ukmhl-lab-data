PART II 102 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK with a plain paste cutter, such as is used for cutting out tartlets, cut out as many circular cases as are re- quired ; take a smaller cutter, press it on the middle of the round, but do not cut right through the bread ; be careful to leave a sufficient thickness at the bottom to allow the case to be filled without breaking. The second cutter marks the piece to be scooped out after the case is fried. Break an egg on to a plate; beat it up slightly; put some bread crumbs on to a sheet of paper; moisten the case with a little milk. This must be done carefully; the best way is to take the case in the hand and pour the milk over the bread with a spoon; the bread must on no account be soaked. As soon as the case is moistened, dip it in the egg, toss it in the crumbs, and fry it in clarified fat (see p. 132). While the case is cooking prepare another. When the bread is of a golden colour take it from the pan; let it drain; scoop out the centre with a fork; put in the filling, and serve. The filling must be made hot before being put into the case. The pieces of bread left over should be used for crumbs or put aside for a pudding, the crusts put in the oven for chapelure (see p^l33). A pudding given on p. 165 is made from pieces of bread. Filling for Cases of Fried. Bread Mince the remains of any kind of cold meat, fish, ham, or poultry; mix it with chopped parsley, cooked onion, cooked mushrooms, chopped small, herbs, or any flavouring that is handy; season with pepper, salt, and spice if liked; make a sauce as directed for rissoles (see p. 98); mix with the meat: heat thoroughly, but do not let the mixture boil; fill the cases with it. A little cream stirred into the sauce improves the flavour: less milk must then be used.

55 OBAP. II SOUPS The secret of preparing this dish, which is an indispensable one in every French household of the middle class, consists in keeping the meat and vegetables at one regular heat, never allowing them to do more than simmer very gently, nor, on the other hand, allow- ing them to cease from simmering. Put the meat into a saucepan ; cover it with the water; add the salt, cloves, and peppercorns. Put the lid on the pan, and let the contents come very slowly to the boil. Carefully remove the scum as it rises, with an iron spoon. Let the pan simmer without interruption for two hours. Prepare the vegetables (see “To Cleanse Vegetables,” p. 33), add them with the bay leaf, gradually, when the meat has simmered for two hours, so as not to check the cooking. Let all simmer for one hour and a half longer. Take the meat from the pan, put it on a dish with the vegetables round it, and a cupful of the broth. Strain the remainder of the broth into a tureen, in which toasted bread, or rusks in nice pieces, should be laid before the broth is poured in. A half teaspoonful of browning should be added to the broth, just before the meat is taken out. Soup Maigre 4 Potatoes 1 Onion 3 Dessertspoonfuls fine Sago 2 Quarts Water 1 Pint Milk Pepper and Salt.

PART ) 8 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK iron, etc., it is enough to observe here, that with the exception of a certain amount of salt, these are not taken into the body in a solid form, but exist in very minute particles in different foods. They are chiefly supplied in vegetables, including grains and fruits. Lime is also supplied in water and in milk. These mineral matters are generally called III. Salts, which are essential to the health of the body. About two-thirds of the human body consist of water. In a full-grown person about five pints pass off daily in various ways. It is therefore evident that if one object of food is to replace the waste of the body, IV. Water must be supplied to replace what goes out, and must therefore form an important part of food. Liquid foods (milk, soups, and drinks) consist largely of water. It is not, however, necessary to replace the waste entirely by drinking liquid, as a large proportion of all appar- ently solid food is in reality water. Fruit and vege- tables contain a great deal of water, and there is much even in animal food. Water does not directly nourish the body either by forming flesh or giving heat. Its chief uses areâ€”(a) to mix with and soften solid food, and thus help the various stages of digestion ; (6) to assist in carrying the food to the various parts of the body, where it is required to replace what has been wasted; (c) to mix with and help to carry off matter which has been used up.1 It is very important that 1 The blood contained in tlio arteries conveys the digested food to the various parts of the body, and that contained in the veins removes the used-up matter. More than three-fourths of the blood consists of water.

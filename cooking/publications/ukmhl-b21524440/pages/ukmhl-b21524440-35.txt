21 ADAPTATION OF FOOD CHAP. Ill doctor is in attendance the diet will of course be regu- lated ; but where there is no doctor the sufierer may be cautioned generally against the use of the following articles of diet, which are difficult of digestion : flatu- lent vegetables (as peas, beans, cabbage); fat and greasy dishes, warmed-up meats, too many sweet dishes, and much tea. Give digestible food plainly dressed; in meats prefer mutton and tripe; give stale or toasted bread, rice, white fish, spinach, vegetable marrow, the flower of cauliflower or broccoli, fruit (if taken at all) only in the morning and quite ripe. Milk generally requires to be mixed with hot water or with potash, soda, or lime water; half a tumbler of hot water taken during dinner or half an hour after it, pro- motes digestion. Peptonised foods of various kinds are often recommended to those suffering from indiges- tion, and usually the directions for cooking or prepar- ing them are sent with each packet. The greatest care should be taken not to overheat this food while prepar- ing it, since the whole good effect is destroyed if the food is once heated to the boiling point. Diabetic patients require food that contains neither starch nor sugar; such as gluten bread, or cocoa specially prepared with a substitute for sugar. Such foods should be used by medical advice only, and be pur- chased only from reliable chemists.

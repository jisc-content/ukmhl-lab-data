CHAP. XI 143 SALADS been grown among weeds; small water-plants and in- sects cling to the leaves and stems. Wash it in two or three waters; pick off any decayed leaves; cut off the thick stalk; then drain and dry. Radishes.—Wash and brush the earth from them ; when clean, cut off the thin part of the root and the green top. Cut into thin slices, or arrange the radishes whole on the top of the salad as a garnish. Beetroot (see p. 115). Celery.—The white heart of the celery is used for salad ; wash free from earth ; dry in a cloth. Onions.—Spring onions should be washed clean; the roots and a part of the green tops cut off. Spanish and other Onions (see p. 34). Lettuce and Endive Salad 1 Cos Lettuce I Salad Dressing, No. 1, p. 147 1 Endive | \ Small Beetroot (cooked) If the lettuce and endive are large, use the half of each ; mix the dressing as directed; put the white of the egg aside to garnish the salad ; cleanse and dry the lettuce and endive (see “To Prepare Lettuce andEndive,” p. 142); cut the heart and leaves of the lettuce across in strips ; divide them if very long; put a part of the cut lettuce into a salad bowl or glass dish; then some leaves of the endive, till all is used; pour the dressing over. Cut the beetroot into slices; divide into dice ; scatter them over the salad, or arrange according to fancy ; cut the white of the egg into slices, and garnish the salad with it. The heart and yellowish green leaves of the lettuce make the best salad; the larger leaves are often tough. Be careful not to use the thick stalk, which is bitter. There should be more lettuce than endive in the salad. Mayonnaise or any other dressing can be used if preferred.

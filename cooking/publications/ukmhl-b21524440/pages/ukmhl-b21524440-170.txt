MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK 156 PART II core. Prepare a pudding-basin (see directions, p. 137); line it neatly with suet crust (see “Suet Crust,” p. 154); put the slices of apple into the lined basin; add sugar according to taste, two or three cloves, or the rind of half a lemon, cut very thin, and two or three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Cover the basin with a piece of paste rolled out to the size required; close the edges carefully. If the pudding is to be boiled, dip a pudding-cloth into boiling water ; squeeze it out (this may be done by putting the cloth into a basin, and pressing the rim of the saucepan lid on it); carefully flour the cloth, and tie it over the top of the pudding-basin with a string. Gather the corners of the cloth together, and tie1 * * them together on the top. Plunge the pudding into boiling water, and let it boil for two hours. Puddings of all kinds are lighter and better if steamed instead of being boiled (see “ To Steam Puddings,” p. 137). Allow half an hour longer if steamed. Gooseberry Pudding Cut off the stalks and tops of the gooseberries; line a basin with suet crust as above; fill the basin with the gooseberries ; add sugar according to the acidity of the fruit, and a little water. Cover the basin with paste, and boil as directed for apple pudding. Currant, raspberry, plum, and all other fruit puddings are made in the same way. If the fruit is juicy, do not add any water.

MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK 94 rART II Tomato Rarebit 1 oz. Grated Cheese 1 Large Tomato 1 Teaspoonful Ketchup 1 oz. Butter Pinch of Pepper \ Teaspoonful Salt Slice of Buttered Toast \ Teaspoonful Lemon Juice Put the butter in a small stewpan with the tomato; let the tomato cook until it is soft enough to pass through a sieve; return the pulp to the pan; add the cheese and flavourings. Stir together till the mixture is hot, but do not let it boil. Serve on buttered toast. Scalloped Tomatoes 1 Teaspoonful Pepper i „ Salt 1 „ Chopped Onion 3 Large Tomatoes 2 Tablespoonfuls Bread Crumbs 1 oz. Butter Cut the tomatoes into halves ; take out the pulp care- fully without breaking the skins. Put the pulp into a pan with the butter, onion, crumbs, pepper, and salt; stir over the fire till the mixture is hot. Fill the skins with the mixture; sprinkle a little chapelure over (see “ Chapelure,” p. 133); pour a few drops of hot butter on each tomato; bake in a hot oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. The onion may be left out if the flavour is disliked. Farce of Tomatoes Tinned tomatoes answer very well for this dish, but whether tinned or fresh, they must be skinned before being cooked. Butter a tin or pie dish ; cut the tomatoes into slices; put a layer of tomato, then a layer of fine bread crumbs mixed with pepper and salt. Proceed in this way till the dish is full; the last layer must be bread crumbs. Melt an ounce of butter; drop it over the crumbs ; bake a golden brown in a hot oven. Serve in the tin or dish in which the mixture has been cooked, slipped into an ornamental dish. Browned onions can be added if liked.

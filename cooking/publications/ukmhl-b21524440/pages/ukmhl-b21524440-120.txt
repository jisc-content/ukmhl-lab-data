MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 10G let the sauce boil for a few minutes; add the cloves, pepper, and salt ; lay in the slices of cold meat; put the pan by the side of the fire, where it can simmei very gently, but not boil, else the meat will be hard. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more stock or water before the meat is put in. Let it simmer for ten or fifteen minutes; serve with sippets of toasted bread or a wall of mashed potatoes. If the sauce is not brown enough, add a little browning, or a teaspoon- ful of mushroom ketchup. Another Way Slices of Cooked Meat 1 Teaspoon ful Chopped Parsley 1 ,, >, Thyme 2 Tablespoonfuls Bread Crumbs £ Teaspoonful Pepper l „ Salt 1 Egg 1 Teaspoonful Lemon Juice Trim the slices of meat as above; mix the parsley, thyme, pepper, and salt with the bread crumbs; break the egg on to a plate; beat it up slightly; dip the slices of meat into the egg, then into the bread crumbs ; cover both sides of the meat. Put about an ounce of butter or very good dripping into a pan ; let it get hot; fry the meat a light brown. Make a sauce with butter and flour, as directed for hashed meat; add the lemon juice after the sauce is taken from the fire; arrange the meat on a dish; pour the sauce round. This dish can be varied by laying the slices of meat on a bed of vegetables, such as peas, mashed potatoes, French beans (see p. 119), or haricot beans (see p. 120). Another variation is to fry the meat without the egg and crumbs, merely sprinkling it with pepper and salt, and arranging the slices round a bed of spinach (see p. 118), adding the gravy or omitting it, according to taste.

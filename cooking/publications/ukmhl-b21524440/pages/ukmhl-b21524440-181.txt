CHAP. XIII 167 PUDDINGS Friarâ€™s Omelette 1 lb. Apples 2 oz. Butter J lb. Bread Crumbs 1 Tablespoon ful Sugar Lemon 2 Cloves Peel, core, and slice the apples ; put them in a pan with the sugar, cloves, rind, and juice of the lemon; add a few spoonfuls of water, according to the juici- ness of the apples ; let them stew till soft. Spread the butter thickly on the sides and bottom of a pie-dish; press the bread crumbs on the butter till the dish is thickly lined ; take the lemon rind from the stewed apple; pour the apple into the pie-dish; cover with bread crumbs; bake for half or three-quarters of an hour. When done, turn out the pudding on to a dish; it should be of a golden brown colour; sprinkle castor sugar over. A little butter stirred into the stewed apple, just before putting it into the dish, makes the pudding richer. Put the fruit (any kind of fresh fruit that is in season will do) into an enamelled or brass pan, with the sugar; let it stew till soft. Cut very thin slices of bread, sufficient to line a pint basin ; cut off the crust; when the fruit is cooked, pour it immediately into tire lined basin ; cover over with bread ; put a plate on the top ; place a weight on it; let the pudding get quite cold. Turn it out on to a dish; serve with custard or cream. This pudding should be made the day before it is wanted. Sponge-cake or Savoy biscuits can be used if liked. Malvern Pudding 1 lb.

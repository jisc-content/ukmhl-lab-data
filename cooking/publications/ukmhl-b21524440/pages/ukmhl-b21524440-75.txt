01 FISH CHAP. Ill Filleted Sole Skin the sole by making an incision at the tail, passing the finger between the skin and the fish along the fin. Divide the sole into four fillets. Cut the fish from the bone as neatly as possible. Flatten the fillets with a knife dipped in cold water, and cut the fins off with a pair of scissors. Roll the fillets over the fingers with the side that was next the bone out- wards. Place the fillets in a buttered baking tin, squeeze lemon juice over them, add salt, cover with buttered paper, and bake in the oven for ten minutes; serve with parsley and butter sauce poured over them. These fillets can be filled with shrimp panada. Mackerel a l’Envers 1 Mackerel 2 Tablespoonfuls Bread Crumbs J Teaspoonful Powdered Herbs 1 Small Sprig of Parsley Small Piece Onion Nutmeg, Pepper, Salt, Cayenne Cut off the head of the mackerel, and clean the fish without cutting the front. Split the fish up the back, and take out the backbone. Put the roe aside. Wash the mackerel in cold water, removing the black skin inside by rubbing it with salt. Dry the fish thoroughly, and lay it in a buttered tin with the skin side down- ward. Chop a small sprig of parsley very fine, powder the sweet herbs, mince the onion, and mix with the bread crumbs, together with a quarter of a saltspoon- ful of pepper, the same of salt, and a little cayenne and grated nutmeg. Spread the mixture on the mackerel, sprinkle some brown bread crumbs over (see “ Cliape- lure,” p. 133), put small pieces of butter on the crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven from fifteen to twenty minutes. A few mushrooms chopped with the parsley and onions are a great improvement to the dish. Bake the roe, and serve with the fish.

CHAP. VIII 111 VEGETABLES Worcester sauce. Turn out the shape; pour the gravy round. The gravy should be a good brown colour. This is an economical way of using up the remains of cold meat, vegetables, or pieces of bread. Cold carrot, or any other vegetable chopped fine, may be mixed with the meat, and improves the flavour. The scraps of bread soaked for a few minutes in a little stock or milk, beaten up so that no lumps remain, may be used instead of rice, or cold potatoes mashed smoothly. An egg makes the dish richer. CHAPTER VIII VEGETABLES Potatoes for Boiling should be chosen as much of one size as possible, in order that all may be equally cooked. They are best cooked in their skins, as the finest part of the potato is next the skin, and some of this is removed by paring before cooking. The length of time required for cooking, varies according to the size and age of potatoes, large and old potatoes taking the longest. Those grown on sandy soil are the finest, and keep their colour best, when not used immediately. Good potatoes should present a mealy and dry appear- ance when well cooked, and should not have any hard piece in the middle. The skins must on no account be eaten, as they are most indigestible. The water in which potatoes are cooked should be thrown away, and potatoes should be parboiled before being added to any dish (Irish stew, etc.), because there is in potatoes a hurtful, almost poisonous, quality, which is removed by great heat; and thus the water that potatoes are boiled in is rendered unwholesome.

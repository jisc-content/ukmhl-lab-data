PKEFACE The Middle Class Cookery Book is intended for the use of families of moderate means, and is a companion to the School Cookery Book} Its com- pilers have endeavoured to give only such recipes and directions as can he carried out by untrained cooks; although the dishes are not restricted to the cheapest kinds of cookery, but are such as are found on the tables of families where one or two servants are kept. With additional eggs, butter, and flavourings, and by the exchange of milk into cream, many of the recipes will be found to belong to the so-called high class cookery; but as there already exist abundance of expensive books on expensive cookery, the object of the School in compiling this little volume is to enable girls who are learning the cookâ€™s art, to prepare a lew inexpensive delicacies. The recipes selected afford many hints to persons of ingenuity, for the 1 Pages 4 to 21 and 22 to 42 are, by permission, almost entirely reprinted from tho School Cookery Book, edited by C. E. Guthrie Wright.

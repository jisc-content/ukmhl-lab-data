MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK 174 PAET II wanted, form a large ball and place it on a floured tin; then place a smaller ball on the top of the large one, and make a small hole or mark on the top. If moulds are used, flour them and half fill them with the dough. Cover the loaves and let them rise for about twenty minutes in a warm place, then bake in a hot oven for about two hours. Turn the loaves out of the moulds, or remove them from the tin, and slant them against a dish or board to allow the steam to escape. The above are general directions; certain flours (generally the best) absorb more water than others, and the cook must learn by experience the proper consist- ency of the dough. If brewerâ€™s yeast is used, the dough may stand all night in a warm place. Wheat Meal Bread 3 lbs. Wheat Meal I 1 Heaped Dessertspoonful Salt 1 i oz. German Yeast | 11 Pint Tepid Water 1 Dessertspoonful Castor Sugar Mix the meal with the salt in a large bowl; cream the sugar and yeast together; add the water to the yeast; make a hole in the middle of the flour ; pour in the yeast and water; make a thick batter in the middle of the meal, leaving the meal round the sides of the hole dry; sprinkle a little meal over the batter; cover the bowl with a cloth, and set the meal in a warm place to rise. When the covering of dry meal sprinkled on the top is broken through, mix all the meal and yeast together; put a little meal on a board; turn the dough on to it, and knead it to a stiff dough. Make it into small loaves; put them on a baking-sheet; cover them with a cloth ; set them again to rise. When risen, bake them in a hot oven for twenty or thirty minutes. The time the dough will take to rise depends on the warmth of the place where it is made.

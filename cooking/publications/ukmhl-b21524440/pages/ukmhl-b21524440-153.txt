139 CHAP. X MISCELLANEOUS Eggs in Sauces The yolk of an egg stirred into melted butter (see p. 124) makes the sauce richer. If used, it must be remembered that if the egg is added while the sauce is boiling, the egg will curdle, and spoil the sauce. The yolk of the egg must be put in after the sauce has cooled a little; the sauce must be stirred during the time the egg is being added. Cooked Vegetables used as Salads French beans, peas, potatoes, haricot beans, cauli- flower, make excellent salads, either by themselves, or mixed two or three together. Small quantities of cold cooked vegetables, instead of being wasted, can be made into an agreeable dish by the use of vinegar and oil (see “Salads,” p. 141). To Boil Eggs Hard Boil the eggs for fifteen minutes; plunge them into cold water for a few minutes ; take them out and remove the shell. To Boil Rice for Curry Take a quarter of a pound of rice (Patna rice is the best for curry); wash it well (see p. 42) ; put it into a saucepan of boiling water; let it boil quickly for fifteen minutes; add a quart of cold water to rinse away the starch ; put it into a colander to drain ; place a plate under the colander when the water has drained away, and another plate over the top ; put the colander into the oven for an hour or rather longer. The rice will be quite white, and every grain separate, if these directions are carefully carried out. To Cream Butter, Eggs, etc. Stir with a wooden spoon, until the butter is like cream, and the eggs arc smooth.

Choose large old potatoes; wash them free from earth; dry them; put them into a hot oven. Turn them occasionally that they may be equally cooked. They are ready when they feel soft, and generally take from an hour and a half to two hours. Serve very hot, in a folded napkin. Boil the potatoes; when quite cooked, drain them and let them dry. Break them up with a large fork, carefully pressing any lumps; when smooth, add the butter, milk, and salt. Stir the potatoes over the fire till they are thoroughly hot; put them on a dish, heaped up lightly ; and score them in ridges by drawing the fork over them. Serve them hot.

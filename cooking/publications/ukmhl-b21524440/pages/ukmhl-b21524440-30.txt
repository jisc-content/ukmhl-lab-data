16 PAET 1 MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK should still form a large part of the diet, also farina- ceous food, especially oatmeal porridge. Stimulants, such as tea and coffee, should, if taken, be weak; coffee with two-thirds milk. Healthy adults should be able to take a free mixture of all wholesome foods, variously cooked, at intervals of about five hours. The circumstances of climate and employment must, however, be considered. The digestive powers of elderly people are weaker than in middle life, the food should, therefore, be nourishing and easy of digestion ; it should be taken warm and at shorter intervals than in middle life. As the system is apt to become lowered during the night, a light nourishing supper is advisable, and in cases of debility, also a little warm food during the night. II. Different Climates More exercise is usually taken in cold than in hot climates, and this causes a more rapid wearing out of the materials of the body. The increased rapidity of breathing, caused by exercise, promotes the mixture of the oxygen of the air with the minute particles of food in the blood, and so uses or burns up more of these, and causes demand for increased supplies of food. Animal food is stimulating and exciting; it is therefore more suitable for cold and temperate climates than for hot. When a false appetite is created for it in hot climates by the use of condiments, it is apt to produce various disorders. Fat is not easily digested unless exercise is taken freely; more oxygen must be mixed with it to produce heat, than is required for starches and sugars. There is more oxygen in the air in cold than in hot weather. It is in cold weather and climates, therefore, that fat can be most easily digested and turned into warmth.

Break the eggs; stir the yolks into the sauce gradually, taking care they do not curdle. This makes a good sauce for cod-steaks or halibut. The capers can be left out, if not liked. In that case, add a dessert- spoonful of plain vinegar to the tarragon vinegar. If well prepared with good salad oil, this is an excellent sauce.

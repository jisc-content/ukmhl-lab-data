Butter Cut the veal into slices; trim off the edges; cut the slices into narrow strips, and divide the strips into small dice; melt the butter in a stewpan; stir in the flour; add the stock and milk gradually; put in the mace, salt, a pinch of white pepper, and the chopped lemon rind ; let the sauce boil for a few minutes ; put the pan by the side of the fire; add the veal to the sauce; let it get hot through, but not boil. Take out the mace; put the veal on a dish; garnish with sippets of toasted bread and slices of lemon. The stock should bo flavoured with vegetables. This is easily done by boiling a small piece of carrot, onion, etc., with a bunch of herbs, in liquor taken from the stockpot. The fat must be first removed (see “Remarks on Hashes,” p. 105).

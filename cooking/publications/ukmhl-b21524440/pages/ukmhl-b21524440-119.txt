COLD MEAT COOKERY CHAP. VII 105 cook can prepare a gravy from the contents of the stockpot (see p. 45) that will enable her to send a savoury dish to table from the remnants of cooked joints. Satirists and humorists have delighted in de- scribing the horrors of a dinner where hashed mutton is the principal dish, and we need not be surprised at this when we see that the popular idea of a hash is a greasy liquid, in which float lumps of tough meat, the whole having a strong flavour of onion. With a small amount of trouble this despised dish may be converted into one as palatable as it is economical. One import- ant rule in re-cooking meat must be remembered; the meat must be put into hot liquid and allowed to heat thoroughly ; but the liquid must not boil after the meat is put in, otherwise the meat will be tough and leathery. A wall of rice, haricot beans, or mashed potatoes im- proves both the look and taste of the dish. A portion of the contents of the stock-jar should be strained from the bones every day and set aside to get cold; the cook will then have a supply of stock, from which all fat can be easily removed ; it is nearly impossible to remove it from hot stock. Greasy gravy is both unpalatable and unwholesome. The bones from the cold meat, instead of being hastily boiled for gravy, can be put into the stockpot, there to stew till all their juices are extracted. Hashed Meat £ lb.

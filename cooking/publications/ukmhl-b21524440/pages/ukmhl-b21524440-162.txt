MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 148 Carefully separate the white from the yolk of the egg ; put the yolk into a basin with the salt; stir it with a wooden spoon; add the oil very gradually, a drop at a time, stirring it into the egg. After the first teaspoon- ful is stirred in, the oil may be added more quickly ; but care must be taken not to pour in more than a few drops at a time. When the oil is all mixed into the egg, the mixture should be quite smooth and thick. Add the vinegar, drop by drop,1 stirring constantly, as before. It may be added in larger quantities as the dressing becomes more mixed, but if much is added at a time, the mixture will curdle and be spoilt. The dressing should be perfectly smooth. It requires a quarter of an hour to prepare this quantity, which is sufficient for a salad. For mayonnaise of fowl, or lobster salad, a larger quantity is required. A little tarragon vinegar mixed with the malt vinegar is a great improve- ment to the flavour. CHAPTER XH PASTRY Short Crust, No. 1 J lb.

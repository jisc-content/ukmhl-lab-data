MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK part ii 38 without a lid on the pan; this helps to preserve the colour. Steaming In steaming, the food to be cooked is placed in a tin or earthenware vessel, covered with a tight cover or buttered paper.1 The vessel is placed in a pan of boiling water, which comes half-way up its side. If the water boils away, more boiling water must be added. Puddings, etc., when steamed, do not require to have so much liquid in them as when baked. The dry air of the oven dries them; steaming keeps them moist (see p. 137). Stewing In stewing juicy meats the outside should be hardened by browning (see p. 42) in order to keep in the juices. The meat is then placed in a stewpan and a small quantity of hot water or stock poured round it. This is slowly warmed and then allowed to simmer slowly, and must on no account be allowed to boil. Stewing chiefly differs from boiling in the quantity of water used, and in the length of time of cooking. The juice that is drawn out of the meat is served in the gravy. Coarse pieces of meat may be made tender by careful and long stewing, but they should not be browned. If very tough, they may be dipped in vinegar to soften the fibre. Gristly pieces should be put on with cold water and simmered till tender, but not allowed to boil fast. Another and a good way of stewing is to put the stew in a stone jar with a closely fitting lid or cover of buttered2 paper. The jar is placed on the hob, or in a slow oven, or in a saucepan with water kept boiling round it. 1 No printed paper should be used in cooking 2 Soft fat can be used instead of butter.

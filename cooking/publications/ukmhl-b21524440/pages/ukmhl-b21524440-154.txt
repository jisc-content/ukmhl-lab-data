MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PAltT II 140 DRINKS Tea In preparing tea, half fill the teapot with thoroughly boiling water; let it stand for two minutes to heat the teapot; pour it away. Have the tea 1 ready to put in immediately; add boiling water (freshly boiled); let it stand for five or seven minutes, or longer if the water is hard. If tea has to be kept, it should be poured off from the leaves, as a bitter and hurtful flavour is drawn out when the leaves are long soaked. The teapot should be well dried before it is set aside, and left with the lid open. For good tea, allow one large teaspoonful to half a pint of boiling water. If inferior tea is used, a larger quantity is required, in proportion to the water. Tea is an exhilarating and refreshing stimulant when properly prepared and taken in moderation. When it is long cooked, or taken in excess, it injures the nervous system and the digestion.

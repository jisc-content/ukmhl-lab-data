Stuff the goose with the same stuffing as for roast duck, increasing the quantity according to the size of the bii'd. Roast before a bright fire for an hour and a quarter, or longer, according to the size of the bird. A very large goose will require nearly two hours to cook. The giblets may be used for gravy, or made into a pie, or stewed. Serve with apple sauce. Clean the giblets thoroughly ; wash them ; put them into a stewpan with the onion, herbs, pepper, and salt; add the water (a little more than a pint may be required); let the giblets stew gently for an hour and a half. Cut the steak in pieces; make a crust of rough puff paste. Take the giblets from the pan ; let them cool; strain the gravy. Lay pieces of the steak in a pie dish; put a layer of giblets on them, then more steak, and so on till the dish is full; pour in the gravy ; cover with the crust; and bake for one hour.

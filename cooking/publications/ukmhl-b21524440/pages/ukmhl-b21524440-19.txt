The blood is spread out in little thin hairlike vessels all over the lungs, so that the air breathed into the lungs may mix with it. The mixture of that portion of the air called oxygen, with the fatty particles floating in this blood, causes in living creatures a burning up of these fatty particles, and this combustion produces heat, and is so much like the process of burning which goes on in a fire, that it is sometimes called animal-burning or combustion.2 This mixture of fresh air with the 1 Technically called Carbonaceous Foods, because they contain a great deal of carbon.

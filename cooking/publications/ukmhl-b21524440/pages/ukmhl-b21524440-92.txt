MIDDLE CLASS COOKERY BOOK PART II 78 Season the meat well with pepper and salt in the space where the bone was removed, before putting in the stuffing. Chop the suet fine; mix it in a basin with the bread crumbs, parsley, grated lemon rind, and the juice of the lemon. Beat up the eggs, add them to the mixture, and stuff the meat according to the direc- tions given above. Boil according to “ General Directions,” p. 37. Serve with caper sauce (see “Sauces,” p. 125), boiled turnips, and carrots (see “Vegetables,” p. 113), either sent to table round the meat, or mashed and served separately. For the loin or neck, see p. 76. Trim the chops to a nice shape, cutting away most of the fat; put the butter into a stewpan, let it get hot, put in the chops, and let them fry a light brown colour but not cook thoroughly. Pare and slice the vegetables (see pp. 33, 34) or cut them iuto dice; add them to the meat; let them fry till slightly brown. When fried, add sufficient cold w-ater to cover or nearly cover the chops; put in the salt, pepper, herbs, and bay leaf; cover the pan closely; let all simmer slowly for one hour and three-quarters. Add a dessertspoonful of ketchup or Worcester sauce to the gravy just before serving the meat. Put the chops on a dish, take out the herbs and bay leaf, pour the gravy, and arrange the vegetables neatly over the meat. Boiled Mutton Haricot Mutton 2 lbs. Chops from the Neck 1J oz.

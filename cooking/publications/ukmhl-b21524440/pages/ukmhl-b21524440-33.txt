CHAP. Ill adaptation of food 19 poor man’s goose, fried liver and bacon,1 and other nutritious but somewhat indigestible articles, may safely form part of the diet of labouring men. Most labourers can obtain cheese, bacon, flour, barley, oatmeal, rice, peas, and beans. With these, and with potatoes and fresh vegetables, grown it may be in their own gardens, a few flavouring herbs (as thyme, mint, marjoram, sage, and parsley), which could easily be cultivated in a small garden, they may obtain a thoroughly nutritious and varied diet. Cheese especially, ranks near flesh meat in the amount of nour- ishment it contains. A dinner of bread and cheese, accompanied by half a lettuce (too little used by the poor), or an apple, water-cress, or a few dandelion leaves, gives all the kinds of food needed to support the body in health. But these materials even when more lightly prepared are unsuitable for children’s diet without the addition of milk, and it is much to be regretted that this im- portant element of diet is so difficult to be obtained in country districts. The custom of allowing each cottager grass for a cow seems to be rapidly dying out, and one consequence of it is that children are in- sufficiently nourished. Landed proprietors and tenant- farmers could hardly confer a greater benefit upon their cottagers than by providing a plentiful supply of milk for them to purchase. In places where there is insufficient pasturage for cows, goats might be kept. IV. Different States of Health Diets for those in health are embodied in the pre- ceding remarks.

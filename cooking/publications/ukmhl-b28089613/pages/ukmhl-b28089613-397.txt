371 The Cellar for Wines. improved by being placed under tbe sun’s rays on the leads of dwelling-houses, a system much practised in the great cities of America. A cellar, as Mr. Red- ding clearly and succinctly says, “ should be a cellar in material, site, temperature, and solidity of con- struction.” The finer and more delicate wines grow turbid, ropy, or sharp when stowed away in unfitting localities. In such a city as London, all one can hope for or expect is to secure a cellar of an equal temperature, solidly constructed of brick or stone. The variations of the external atmosphere should not be allowed to penetrate within it. As Barry wrote ninety years ago, “the structure of a wine cellar ought to be such as will most effectually defend the wine from the frequent variations of the external air, adjacent fires, and the agitation of carriages, and to preserve an equal degree of heat, though some varia- tions must be unavoidable.” Lighter wines require a colder cellar than the strong wines; but, as a general direction, the tem- perature of a cellar ought to be from about forty to fifty degrees. The size of a cellar ought to be in proportion to the quantity of wine for which it is designed. The situation ought to be low and dry. Double doors are an advantage to every cellar, as one may be closed before the other is opened, and thus the changes of the external atmosphere cannot penetrate. Cellars in private houses are rarely ven- tilated, and thus foul air is frequently generated. In

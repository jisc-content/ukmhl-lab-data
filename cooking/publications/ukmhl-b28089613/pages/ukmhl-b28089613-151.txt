Soups and Broths. 125 and the shank-hones of mutton, are excellent addi- tions to the stock-pot, and should be reserved for it. As soup is the food of childhood and old age, it should be restorative and nourishing. The great de- fect of English soups is, not the want of meat, but the want of a proper boiling or concoction. This radical fault is vilely but vainly attempted to be sup- plied by the excessive use of seasoning and herbs. The following elementary rules for making nourish- ing broth, are from the French of Parmentier I. Sound, healthful, fresh viands. II. Vessels of earthenware in preference to those of metal, as a less degree of heat keeps them boiling; and once heated, a few hot cinders will maintain that slight degree of ebullition which is wanted. III. Double the weight of water to that of the meat used. IV. A sufficient quantity of common salt to facilitate the separation of the blood and slime that co- agulates under the form of scum. O V. In the early stage of the process, such a degree of heat as will throw off the whole scum. VI. A lower, but an equable temperature, that the soup may simmer gently till the substances employed, whether nutritive, colouring, or flavouring, are perfectly combined with the water, according to their several degrees of solubility.

194 Game and Pastry. Russe, gooseberry and all tartlets; but this is a widely different thing from undertaking this duty for a dinner of fourteen, sixteen, or twenty persons, in addition to the two or three courses. For my own part, I have remarked that the people most in the habit of dining out eat very sparingly of pates and pastry. Under the head patisseries, the French in general comprehend, first, les pates chands et tourtes cTentrees. Secondly, les pates froids, les gateaux, les patisseries sucrees. Thirdly, les patisseries seches ou croquantes, eaten at dessert. In early ages, in France, the caba- retiers, who furnished food to the traveller, furnished also pastry. Saint Louis, in 1270, regulated this trade by certain statutes; but there was not a regular com- pany of patissiers till 1567. One hundred and fifty years ago Pithiviers was celebrated for its pates of larks; Perigueux, for its pates of truffled partridges; Amiens, for its turkeys and geese; Angers, for its poulardes ; Versailles, for its foies gras, and Strasbourg and Toulouse, for its pates of foies d'oies. It was not till 1780 that a patissier of Paris invented pates de jambon. When l'Uopital was Chancellor of France, he forbade the sale of petits pates in Paris, on the ground, “ qu’un pared commerce favorisait d’un cotei la gourmandise et de l’autre la paresse.”

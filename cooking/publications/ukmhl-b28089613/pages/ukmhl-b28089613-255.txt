The Dessert. 229 manners of the court of Henry III., makes the same remark. After the dessert, says he, “ Les uns pre- noient un peu d’anis confit, les autres, cotignac,* mais il falloit qu’il fut musque. Autrement il n’eut point eu d’effet en leur estomach qui n’avoit point de cha- leur s’il n’etoit parfumA” At the royal table, and in establishments of great lords, another custom prevailed which did not obtain in the houses of private persons. Independently of the spices which composed the dessert, there were others more select still, which were served in a small box divided into compartments. This box was of gold, silver, or silver gilt, and was called a drageoir, comfits being the principal portion of its contents. This box was generally presented to the king by an esquire or person of condition, and to the king only, unless his majesty wished particularly to honour some one among the guests. He then sent to him his comfit-box, <c On apporta vins et epices,” writes Froissart, “ et servit du drageoir, devant le Hoi de France tant seulement, le Comte d’Harcourt.” Brandied fruits, compotes and fruits preserved in syrup, are generally produced at a French dessert; as are marmalade fruits, as, for instance, marmelade (Tabricots, de peches, de pommes, &c. Fruit jellies, as cornel berry jelly, apple jelly, are also esteemed deli- cacies. Various pastes are also occasionally handed * Cotignac was a confection of quinces.

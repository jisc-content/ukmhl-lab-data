An ordonnance published by him directed that in each canton, or district, the vines should only occupy a third of the ground; the other two-thirds were to be converted into arable or pasture lands. In 1577 Henry III. modified the ordonnance of the king his brother, recommending to all the officers charged with the government of his provinces to see that the arable land was not left uncultivated to give place to an excessive plantation of the vine. The edict published under the reign of Louis XY. was not so foolish as the preceding one. Many in- tendants of provinces having represented that the vines occupied an undue space of lands fitted for corn or pasturage ; that it caused the dearness of wood ; that it multiplied the quantity of wine to such an excess that the value and reputation were in a number of places destroyed; the king, in 1731, for- bade any new plantation of vines, and directed that vineyards which had ceased to be cultivated for two years should no longer be continued. It often happened that proprietors of wines, not being able to get rid of their article, preferred to sell it in retail. In this contingency they suspended to the threshold of their door a broom, a crown of ivy, or something similar. Those who wished to purchase carried a pot with them, and thence came the ex- pression, vendre d pot. Some caused their wine to be announced by the public crier.

What- ever is boiled in a brass or copper pot, should be taken out while it is hot; if left to cool, it would have a disagreeable taste, and be very unwholesome. As a convincing proof of this, if the liquor that any kind of meat is boiled in remains in the pot till the next day, the fat at the top will be quite green, and the liquor of course very pernicious. Iron pots, sauce- pans, &c., are the most wholesome, but they spoil the colour of many articles of cookery, and therefore are not much used ; but they are useful for anything that would not be discoloured. Pots lined with earthen- ware are certainly preferable to any other kind, but they are very expensive. The broth to be used for soups and gravies should be kept separate ; because the broth of the stock-pot, being required for white as well as brown sauces, should not be coloured ; whilst that for soups, unless they be white soups, should always be made brown.

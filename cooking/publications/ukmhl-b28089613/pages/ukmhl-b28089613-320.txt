294 On Wines, Ancient and Modern. It will appear from what I have written that the attention paid to vine-dressing and the cultivation of the vine was the result of a perfect knowledge of husbandry. I have already said that the wines of the ancients were racked and fined, but there seems to have been as much adulteration 1800 years ago as at the pre- sent moment. Adulterations are repeatedly men- tioned in the classic writers. After the wine was made and underwent the secondary fermentation, it was placed in pitched skins, or in earthen vessels, denominated amphoree, containing twenty-seven old English gallons. That the ancients understood the process of matur- ing wines perfectly is evident from all the writers on the subject. After the wine was made and put into the vat, where it underwent the secondary fer- mentation, it was placed in pitched skins, closed with a lid of baked earth, and hermetically sealed.* It were a curious task to trace how long; domestic customs and utensils survive forms of polity and go- vernment. In glancing at such a subject, I merely remark that the amphorae have outlived the Roman * It would, however, appear that the Romans employed corks :— “ Corticem astrictum pice dimovebit Amphorm,” says Horace.

Anthony Careme. 397 Anthony Careme? Did he not abandon the first families to write his cookery and the practice of some great contemporaries t for, observe you, Careme is not always peering a Brodignagian / under your nose, or flourishing the flaunting motto of ‘ Ego et Rex Meus ” before your perplexed eyes. No, this good savoury Samaritan cook has some bowels, some thoughts of others, some kindliness for the absent and the departed.

See how great geniuses fall on the same style and method. “ It was in the night,” says Careme, “ after a short sleep, that I lately dictated to my daughter my most recent chapters.” “ In the busiest period of my service with Alexander,” says this ingenious maker of sauces, “ I never once abandoned my evening notes.” Admirable, glorious man ! who will not think in reading this of the parallel passage in the life of Fox, who, in the busiest conflicts of party, left the blaze and bustle of the Commons to read Aristophanes, as the other great pei’former left

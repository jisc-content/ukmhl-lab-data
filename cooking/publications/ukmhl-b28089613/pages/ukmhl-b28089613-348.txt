322 On Wines, Ancient and Modern. reason is that one occupies himself personally in the matter, whilst the other trusts to an ignorant or knavish vine-dresser. To Francis I., and the grandees of his court, Champier attributes the discredit into which the wines of the neighbourhood of Paris had commenced to fall. “ These personages,” says he, “ having had their taste blunted by good cheer, found the Parisian wines poor and weak. They, therefore, fell on the strong and vigorous wines of the south of France, which they obtained at considerable cost.” The Auvernat wine of Orleans, so praised by the Abbe de Marolles, is thus severely treated by Boi- leau,— “ Un laquais effronte m’apporte un rouge bord D’un Auvernat fumeux, qui mele de lignage; Se vendoit chez creuet pour vin de l’hermitage; Et qui rouge et vermeil, mais fade et doucereux, N’avoit rien qu’on gout plat, et qu’un deboire affreux.” The first time I find mention of a vin de Grave is towards the year 1550. If we are to judge from the testimony of Madame de Sevigne, it was indifferently esteemed in her day. In speaking of M. de Lavar- din, who is stated by St. Evremont to have been Bishop of Metz, she says, “ C’est un gros merite qui ressemble au vin de Grave.” The district of Graves yields from 1000 to 1500 tuns, generally of a lively and brilliant colour, with more body than the vines of Medoc, but less bouquet, raciness, and fineness.

Of the turkey, Nonius says, “ Egre gie alunt et bonum succum corpori euppeditant.”* Some writers, such as Athenaeus, JElian, and Aiis- totle, would have us believe that turkeys were known to the ancients under the name of Meleagrides, but this is a mistake. It is a nice question when turkeys first appeared in France, and who first introduced them. La Mare, in his « Traite de la Police,” would have it that it was Jaques Cceur, the treasurer of Charles VII.; but this is also an error. According to Champier, who wrote his treatise “ De Re Cibaria,” in 1560, they Avere only introduced into France a few years before he wrote. Here are his words: — “ Venere in Gallias, annos abhinc paucos, aves qurn- dam externa}, quas gallinas indicas appellant: credo quoniam ex Insulis Indiae nuper a Lusitanis His- panisque palefactae,primum invectas fuerunt in urbem nostrum.” In the French poets of the thirteenth century, and in authors still more ancient, there is frequent men- tion of capons. Madame de Sevigne speaks of the “ poulardes de C&n,” and of the “ bonnes poulardes de Rennes.” In Regnard’s “ Comedy du Bal,”A.D. 1696, the author speaks in praise of “ les poulardes de Caux.” Long—nearly a century—antecedent to this, our *“Ludovici JSTonni Dieteticon,” Antverpiae, mdcxvi.

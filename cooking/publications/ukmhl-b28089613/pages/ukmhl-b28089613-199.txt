Boiling. 173 or fried, may be served in twenty ways—a la hol- landaise, a la Sainte Menehould, a la 1 erigeaux, a la provengale. As to salmon, the same observation may be made. It may be served d la Saint Cloud, a la genevoise, a la venitienne, a la Royale, in filets aux anchois, d la d’Artois, a la Sainte Menehould, en pa- pillotes, a la d'uxellc ; but, unless you have a superior cook, salmon is best plain boiled. I will conclude with the following remarks as to the time required to boil poultry. Turkeys, capons, fowls, chickens, &c., are all boiled in the same manner, allowing time according to their size. A chicken will take about twenty minutes. A fowl, about forty minutes. A poularde or capon, about an hour. A small turkey, an hour and a half. A large turkey, two hours or more. Rabbits should be put into a basin of warm water; then put them into plenty of water, and boil half an hour. If large, three quarters of an hour. Of frying I would merely say, that the frying is the finest and most delicate when good olive oil is employed. “ II est reconnu que c’est avec la bonne huile d’olive que se font fritures les plus fines, les plus delicates.”—Manuel de Cuisinier et de la Cui- siniere, par P. Cardelli.

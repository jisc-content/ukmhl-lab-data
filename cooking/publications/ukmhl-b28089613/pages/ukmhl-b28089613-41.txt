Ancient and JSlediccval Cookery. 15 Mans, in speaking of the clique, says, “ Us ne sau- roient manger que du veau de riviere: il faut que leurs perdrix viennent d’Auverge : que leurs lapins soit de la Roche Guyon.”* The same thought may he found in the fifth Satire of Juvenal, though some- what differently expressed. “ Mullus erit domino, quern misit Corsica, vel quern Taurominitanse rupes, quando omne peractum est, Et jam deficit nostrum mare.” With the qualifying restrictions previously made, it may fairly be admitted that it is not to the Grand Monarque, but to the Regent Orleans, that the French of the present day owe the exquisite cuisine of the eighteenth century. The Pain a la d' Orleans was the invention of the regent himself; the filets de lapereau d la Petri were invented by his aban- doned daughter, the Duchess de Berri, who plunged into every sensual excess, and whose motto was <£ Courte et bonne.',’> • Her suppers were the best, and, it must be added, the most profligate in Paris. As the Duchess de Berri, the daughter of the re- gent, was gourmande as well as galante, she is deified by the race of cooks and epicures, one of whom says that the alimentary art owes to her fertile genius a great number of receipts. Nor Avas she the only female who distinguished herself at this era in cookery, for it became d-la-mode to be the creator of a plat. * Amsterdam, 1726.

212 On Salad. asparagus, which had been freshly gathered by Ids farmer’s wife. “ Montani Asparagi, posito quos legit villica fuso.” I remember having read somewhere of a gentleman travelling near the town of Arras (where Robes- pierre was born), and meeting a countryman who in- sisted on supping with him. Entering an inn, the gentleman asked for an omelette and some asparagus. After having helped the rustic to his half-share of the omelette, the stupid lout asked what were the aspara- gus. “Oh! ” replied the host, “they are a very fine vegetable, and you shall have half of the bunch, as you have had half of the omelette.” Thereupon the intelli- gent gourmand transferred to his neighbour’s plate the ends, or as the late Mr. Justice Creswell quaintly, yet forcibly used to say it, the handle of the esculent, who thought these quisquilice tougher to chew than the stalky part of the cabbage. The Marquis de Cussy tells us that no less a per- sonage than Napoleon ate the haricots de soissons, or kidney-beans with oil, as a salad.

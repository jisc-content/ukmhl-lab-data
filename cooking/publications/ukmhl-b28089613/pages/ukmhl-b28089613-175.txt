149 On Fish. sturgeon taken in the sea, or elsewhere, within the realm is seldom seen at private tables in England. Two distinct species have been distinguished by the fishermen of the Solway Firth; but several species frequent the rivers of Russia. Caviare, so much used in Russia, and now very generally imported into this country, is made of the roe of the female sturgeon. The flesh of the sturgeon, besides being preserved by salting and pickling, is in request for the table while fresh, and is generally served with a l’ich sauce. The appearance and flavour of stur- geon is not unlike that of veal. The flesh, like that of most of the cartilaginous fishes, is more firm and compact than is usual among those of the osseous families. When fresh, sturgeon is as white as the very finest veal; when red, nothing whatever can be done with it. There are thirty different methods of dressing sturgeon in France. I give the names of a few of them :— Darne d’estm-geon a la broche sauce genoise. Esturgeon en Tortue. Esturgeon au vin de madere ou de champagne. Cotelletes d’esturgeon a la Sainte Menehould. Filets d’esturgeon a la Orly. Papillotes d’esturgeon aux fines herbes. Sturgeons in England are roasted, or baked, or boiled in Ude’s manner, or served a la Beaufort, for which there is a receipt in Francatelli’s “ Modern Cook.”

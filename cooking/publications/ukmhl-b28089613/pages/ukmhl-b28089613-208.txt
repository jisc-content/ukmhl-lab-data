We have no idea of this expendi- ture in England, nor do our higher and better classes use or consume truffles as they ought to be used. Chaptal, who was one of Napoleon’s Ministers of the Interior in France, published a work, “ Sur Indus- trie Fran9aise,” in 1819. In it he speaks of the enor- mous quantities of fowls in France :■— « In order to have an idea (says the Comte de Chaptal) of the enormous quantity of fowls of all species which exists in France, it will suffice to ob- serve, that there are annually sold at the markets of Toulouse 120,000 geese, which are fattened in the neighbourhood; and M. Lavoisier has estimated the number of eggs consumed at Paris, on an average of several years, at 78,000,000, and the number of fowls at 39,000,000. Supposing the price of each- to be a franc, including the cocks, this would give a capital of 41,600,000 francs. If to this be added the value of hens and cocks, of turkeys, geese, ducks, and pigeons renewed almost every year, the amount may be aug- mented by 10,000,000 ; so that the capital for fowls of all species amounts to 51,600,000 francs.” Some exquisites and Muscadins of the second Em- pire maintain that there is nothing “ si Chaussee d’Antin,” nothing “ si lourdement bourgeois” as a dinde aux truffes, as a plat de rot.

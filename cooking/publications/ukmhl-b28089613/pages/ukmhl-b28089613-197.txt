Boiling. each pound will suffice. During the process of boil- ing meat or fish, the scum which arises should be skimmed off, otherwise the meat or fish will be dis- coloured. The majority of cookery books direct that fresh meat should be put into water when it boils, and salt meat when the water is cold ; but the bet- ter opinion seems now to be that fresh and salted meats should be put into cold water, and allowed to become hot gradually. The five constituent pro- perties of the flesh of animals used by man areâ€” fibrine, gelatine, osmazone, fat, and albumen. Gela- tine is soluble only in boiling or very hot water, whereas osmazone is very soluble, even in cold water, and contains the sapid principle of all meats. Fat is insoluble in water, but the heat melts it, when it floats in a liquid form on the surface. Albumen resembles the white of an egg. It is soluble in cold or lukewarm water, and coagulates at a less temperature than that of boiling water. Albu- men abounds in the blood, and exists in portions of the flesh of animals. It is the albumen, in coagula- ting after having been dissolved, which causes the scum to rise in the liquid in which a joint has been boiled. It is evident that if the meat be put in a vessel with boiling water, or if the water being cold be boiled too quickly, the albumen in the first case by coagulating on the surface of the water, and in the second in the interior of the joint of meat, pre- vents the gelatine and osmazone from dissolving.

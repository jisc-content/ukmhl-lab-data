151 On Fish. considered it as the best dish at their grand re- % pasts. Next to turbot, the fish most in request at English dinner-tables during the season is salmon. Our chief salmon fisheries are carried on in the rivers and es- tuaries of Scotland; but the finest salmon in the London market comes from the Southampton water, near Christchurch; and much good salmon is also sent to Billingsgate both from Ireland and Holland. The produce of the fishings of the rivers Tay, Dee, Don, Skey, Findhorn, Beauley, Borriedale, Thurso, and the coasts adjacent, are conveyed in steam-boats and small sailing-vessels to Aberdeen, where they are packed with ice in boxes, and sent to London. The Severn salmon is in season in January, Feb- ruary, March, October, November, and December; and the Scotch from March to September. There are innumerable ways of dressing salmon practised by French cooks, such as Dame de saumon au vin de champagne, sauce au beurre d'ecrevisses, sau- mon au court bouillon, a la frangaise, a la Re- gence, a la Cardinale, &c.; but it may be ques- tioned whether salmon is ever eaten with more relish or satisfaction by Englishmen than when plain boiled, either whole or in slices, in the English fashion. It may be served with lobster, shrimp, Dutch, or parsley- and-butter sauce. The slices of crimped salmon served at London dinners in May and June, are, to my mind, perfection.

Ancient and Medieval Cookery. 16 The Jilcts de volatile a la Bellevue were invented by the Marquise de Pompadour, in the chateau of Bel- levue, for the petits soupers of the king. The poulets a la Villeroy owe their birth to the Marechale de Luxembourg, then Duchess of Villeroy, one of the most sensual “ gourmandes ” of the court of Louis XV. The Chartreuse a la Mauconseil has been trans- mitted to us by the Marquise de Mauconseil, cele- brated alike by her taste and her gallantries. The vol au vent a la Nesle proceeded from the fertile brain of the Marquis de Nesle, who refused the peerage to remain premier marquis of France, and the poularde a la Montmorency was the production of the duke of that name. Filets de veau a la Montgolfier, are so named because they are of the shape of balloons. The petites bouchees a la reine owe their origin to Maria Leczinska, wife of Louis XV., whose devotions, how- ever self-denying in other respects, never prevented her from relishing a good dinner. All the entrees bearing the name of Bayonnaises were invented by the Marechal Duke de Richelieu. The perdreaux a la Montglas acknowledge as their father a worthy magis- trate of Montpelier, whilst the cailles a la Mirepoix were imagined by the marechal of that name, who in gourmandise, but in gourmandise only, rivalled the Marechal de Luxembourg; and last, though not least, the cotelettes d la Maintenon were the favourite dish of that frigid piece of pompous and demure hypocrisy, Madame de Maintenon herself.

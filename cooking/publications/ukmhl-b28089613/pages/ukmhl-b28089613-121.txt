This is a more common arrangement than three courses, which are attended with so much additional trouble both to the guests and servants. Whether the dinner be of two or three courses it is managed nearly in the same way.

When there are rare French or Rhenish wines, they are placed in the original bottles, in ornamented wine- vases, between the centre-piece and the top and bot- tom dishes ; or if four kinds, they are ranged round the plateau.

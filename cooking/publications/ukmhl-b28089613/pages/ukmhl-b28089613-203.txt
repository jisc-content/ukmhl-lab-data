In short, if it were true that the eating of these fowls brought the gout upon us, we should see nothing else but gouty persons everywhere ; for we may say, that there is now-a-days no food more com- mon than poultry.” Of capons, this famous doctor thus speaks : — « Their flesh is very nourishing, it produces good juice, is restorative, recovers decayed strength, good for the phthisic and consumptions, easy of digestion ; and they often make broth of it, in order to fortify and recover strength. The flesh of a capon is in virtue and taste much like unto that of a chicken ; in the mean time, that of a capon is more nourishing, pleasant and properer for people used to fatigue than the other; and the reason is, because this same flesh contains juices that are more concocted, digested, and fuller of oily balsamic particles.” When poultry is brought into the kitchen for use, it should be kept as cool as possible. The best posi- tion in which to place it is with the breast down- wards, on a shelf or marble slab. The crop and the gut of the rump should be taken out. Choose fowls with a thin transparent skin, white and delicate. Pigeons full fledged, are heating and hard to digest. The younger they are in general the better, and in Italy, where pigeons are much used, they are always eaten young. In choosing turkeys, select the brown Norfolk; but if you can find any of the red American breed, the flavour is still finer. N

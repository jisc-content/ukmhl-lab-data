91 VALUABLE EECIPES. TO BOIL CORNED BEET. Mrs. J. Beaty. But the beef in water enough to cover it, ana Vet it heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careful to take oh the grease. Many think it much improved by boiling potatoes, turnips, and cabbages with it. In this case the vegetables must be pealed and all the grease care- fully skimmed as fast as it rises. Allow about twenty minutes of boiling for each pound of meat. BEEF OR VEAL STEWED WITH APPLES. Mrs. James Beaty. Rub a stewpan with butter; cut the meat in thin slices, and put in with pepper, salt, and apple, sliced fine; some would add & little onion. Cover it tight, and stew till tender.

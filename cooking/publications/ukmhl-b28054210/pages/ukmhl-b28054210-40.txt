THE HOME COOK BOOK. 34 If there be a card receiver in the hall, the visitor’s card is left in it, that the hostess may have the pleasure after- ward of recalling all the friends who favour her with their presence. Coffee, chocolate, cake and ices, are to be found in a side room at such receptions. The form of card for afternoon tea, which means ladies in visiting or carriage dress, a harlequin tea service, each cup different, or a set of choice East India China, scorns coosy with warm curtains, and signs of womanly occupa- tion, everything in short to have the daintiest horne-iook possible, are issued in this fashion : Mbs. Bradley Cowles, Friday, January 18th, Tea at 4 o’clock. (Name and No. of street.) Guests arrive in the five minutes before the hour, or the five minutes after. The tea is brought in punctually and placed on the hostess’ table in the corner, where are the urns of black, green and Eussian tea for those who like each, a basket of wafers, delicate sandwiches of chicken or thin sliced meats, and a basket of fancy cake. If the English style is followed, the cups of tea are carried to the guests on a tray, and a tiny table to rest the cups on placed in reach of each group. Cards are issued for dinner parties and afternoon recep- tions in distinction from evening parties and weddings, invitations to which are engraved on notepaper. Written invitations are more complimentary than printed ones, but the idea of cards and engraved requests is to save the labour of writing notes for a large party, 02

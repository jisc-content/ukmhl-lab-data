THE HOME COOK BOOK. 296 ciently baked, pierce it with a broom-straw through the centre ; if done the straw will come out free from dough; if not done, dough will adhere to the straw. Take it out of the tin about fifteen minutes after it is taken from the oven (not sooner), and do not turn it over on the top to cool. ICING. The following rules should be observed where boiled icing is not used : Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthen dish, and allow, at least, a quarter of a pound or sixteen table- spoons of the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part of the sugar at first and sprinkle over the eggs; beat them for about half an hour, stirring in gradually the rest of the sugar ; then add the flavour. If you use the juice of a lemon, allow more sugar. Tartaric acid and lemon juice whitens icing. It may be shaded a pretty pink with strawberry juice or cranberry syrup, or coloured yellow by putting the juice and rind of a lemon in a thick muslin bag and squeezing it hard into the egg and sugar. If cake is -well dredged with flour after baking, and then carefully wiped before the icing is put on, it will not run and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting on to the cake in large spoonsful, commencing over the centre ; then spread it over the cake, using a large knife, dipping it occasionally in cold water. Dry the frosting on the eako in a cool, dry place. FPOSTING. Mrs. Louise Dewey. One pint granulated sugar, moisten thoroughly with

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 12 curtains drape well, if the walks, steps, and piazzas ara neat, and the door knobs and paint in order, making a note of every want, and having it attended to at once. Dexterity with tools is very convenient to any one, and I have known accomplished women who would set a pane of giass, put on a door knob, and hang a gate in the best style. One of the valued contributors to the New York press is a woman who reads Horace in Latin, and Bastiat’s political economy, makes point-lace and em- broiders beautifully, who at the gold mines with her husband built the chimney to her house, and finished most of the interior with her own hands. A little care, weekly, keeps a place in that bright order that so attracts and welcomes one at sight. It looks as if whole people lived in it, with live sensibilities and intelligence. In- doors the same spirit is reflected. The bell-pull never is left for weeks after it gets loose, the gas burners are never suffered to leak, or grow dim; the kerosene lamps are large enough to give good light, and of the best pattern for safety, and for the eye. The stoves are the open “Fireside” kind, the modern version of the old Franklin stoves—giving the ventilation and delight of an open fire, burning either coal or wood, wflth bars and fender like a grate; yet, capable of being shut up as tightly as any base-burning heater by two tight fitting covers that may be removed and put away at pleasure. The health, the comfort, the luxury of such an addition makes up for many a deficiency beside. The carpet was well-chosen at first in small figure and warm colours of good quality, whether Brussels or three-ply, and it looks well as long as it lasts, and kept clean by shaking twice a year.

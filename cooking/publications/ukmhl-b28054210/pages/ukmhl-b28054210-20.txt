A scrap basket, with ap- plique border, and a bright lining, goes far toward keep- ing a room tidy. The mistress will try to have her rooms in keeping with the style by a few pieces of furni- ture in the fashion of the day, a Turkish chair embroid- ered in wools, a straight-backed one in unbleached toweling and applique of crimson, blue, black and gold, a stand covered with velvet, or a home-made easel with the single good picture the house affords on it, a jar- diniere of titles or wickerwork in the window, or a bamboo lounge, things not expensive in themselves, yet lending a graceful air to quiet surroundings.

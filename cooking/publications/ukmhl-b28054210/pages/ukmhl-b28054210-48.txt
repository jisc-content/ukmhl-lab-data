Then Jennie read on: “A little nutmeg ; flour enough to stiffen it, so aa to bake in rings ; bake quickly.” The flour was sifted; the butter and sugar first creamed together by Annie, while Jennie beat the yolk of the egg, and added it to the creamed sugar and but- ter ; then they put in the nutmeg, the cream and the soda; then the beaten white of the egg, and the sifted flour ; then they put the jumbles into the buttered rings and baked them. As the oven was quick and hot, I am happy to say these jumbles were a success. In taking them out of the tins when done, they did not pile them on one another, but placed them carefully about on a large plate to cool. Then the little housekeepers made the tea, according to the directions in the Cook Book, and also the cheese sandwiches, which were a complete suc- sess. The cutting of the bread was a difficult task, since to be nice the slices should be even and thin, but it was managed nevertheless with patience and care. When all was ready, the cream nicely whipped, the strawber- ries put in the preserve dish, the little round table in mamma’s room drawn out, and the luncheon arranged, they were just ready to sit down to enjoy the fruits of their labour, what should they hear but Bridget’s voice at the door. So it came to pass, that with the luncheon ended for this time the practical experiments of our little housekeepers. But it all goes to prove that, if we live with our eyes open, we shall all of us find that, with such help as our Home Cook Book, we shall be ready for those emergencies which come to big as well as the little housekeepers, when Bridget is not at hand.

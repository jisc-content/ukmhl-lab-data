54 THE HOME COOK BOOK. The day it is wanted for the table, fry a3 brown as possi- ble a carrot, an onion and a very small turnip sliced tliin. Just before taking up, put in half a teaspoonful of sugar, a blade of mace, six cloves, a dozen kernels of allspice, a small tablespoonful of celery seed. With the vegetables this must cook slowly in the soup an hour; then strain again for the table. If you use vermicelli or pearl barley, soak in water. JULIENNE SOUP. M. A. T. Shred two onions and fry brown in a half spoon of but- ter; add a little mace, salt and pepper; then a spoonful or so of stock; rub a tablesp^onful of flour smooth with a little butter and let fry with the onions; strain through 9 colander, then add more stock if desired; cut turnip, car rot and celery in fillets ; add a few green peas; boil ten- der in a littie wrater and add both water and vegetables the soup. If washed, the flour can be left out, and it will make a clear light-coloured soup. In that case the onion3 should be cut in fillets and boiled with the vegetables. MUTTON SOUP. Mrs. Whitehead. Eoil a leg of mutton three hours; season to your taste with salt and pepper, and add one teaspoon of summer savory; make a batter of one egg, two tablespoons of milk, two tablespoons of flour, all well beaten together; drop this batter into the soup with a spoon, and boil for three minutes.

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 228 is white and stiff; mould and pour around it soft custard. CHARLOTTE RUSSE. Mrs. A. M. Gibbs. Whip one quart rich cream to a stiff froth, and drain well on a nice sieve. To one scant pint of milk add six eggs beaten very light; make very sweet; flavour high with vanilla. Cook over hot water till it is a thick cus- tard. Soak one full ounce Coxeâ€™s gelatine in a very lit- tle water, and warm over hot water. When the custard is very cold, beat in lightly the gelatine and the whipped cream. Line the bottom of your mould with buttered paper, the sides with sponge cake or lady-fingers fastened together with the white of an egg. Fill with the cream, put in a cold place or in summer on ice. To turn out, dip the mould for a moment in hot water. In draining the whipped cream, all that drips through can be re- whipped. CHARLOTTE RUSSE. Mrs. J. P. Holt. Take one quart of thin cream, sweeten and flavour; whip the cream until all in froth ; then take half box of gelatine, put in as little cold water as possible to soak, and set on the stove to melt; have the gelatine cool be- fore putting into the cream; have a dish already lined with cake or lady-fingers, pour the cream into it and set on ice until ready for use.

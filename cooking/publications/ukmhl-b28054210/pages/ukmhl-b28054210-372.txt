366 THE HOME COOK BOOK. TO PRESERVE EGGS. Mrs. Midgley. Take a patent pailful of spring water, pour it into a stone jar, take one pound of lime, one pint of Liverpool salt: let it stand for three days, stir it every day, then pour it off, and put in your eggs. HOW TO MAKE UP SHIRT BOSOMS. Take two ounces of fine gum arabic powder; put it in a pitcher and pour into it a pint or more of boiling water, according to the degree of strength you require and then having covered it let it stand all night; in the morning pour it carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle, cork and keep it for use. A tablespoonful of gum stirred into a pint of starch made in the usual man- ner will give to lawn, either white or printed, a look of newness when nothing else can restore them after they have been washed. IRONING. To keep starch from sticking to irons rub the iron* with a little piece of wax or sperm. GREASE ERASER. Mrs. Oiipbant. Benzine, alcohol, ether, equal parts; mix; apply with Bponge (patting the spot); put a piece of blotting paper on each side and iron with a hot flat iron.

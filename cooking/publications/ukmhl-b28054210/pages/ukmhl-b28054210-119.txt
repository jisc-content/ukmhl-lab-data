113 VALUABLE RECIPES. POTATO SALAD. M. A. T. Sliced cold boiled potatoes; almonds blanched and quartered; hickory nuts, also, if liked (both of these may be omitted). A very small quantity of chopped onions; pour over this any good salad dressing, not too much, and garnish with chopped parsley; cold boiled beets, sliced lemon, and anchovies, may be added to the salad, if liked. ASPAEAGUS SALAD. Boil the asparagus in water until tender; cut off the hard ends, and set the rest away. When cool, cut in inch long pieces, and put it in your salad dish. Pour over a mayonaise dressing, and garnish with a few capers. CUCUMBER SALAD. Mrs. King. Take a dozen ripe “white spine” cucumbers ; wash, pare, and cut into strips, taking out the seeds; cut into pieces, like small dice; to each dozen cucumbers take twelve large white onions chopped; six large green pep- pers, also chopped; one-quarter pound each of black and white mustard seed, and a gill of celery seed; mix all well together; add a teacup of salt, and hang up in a cotton bag to drain for twenty-four hours. Then add enough clear cold vinegar to cover it; put into stone jars and fasten nearly air-tight. In six weeks it will be fit for use. Excellent.

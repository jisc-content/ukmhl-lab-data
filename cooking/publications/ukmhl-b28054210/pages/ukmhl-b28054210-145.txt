VALUABLE RECITES. 139 PICKLED OYSTEES. Mrs. Carl Hammond. 'Wash the oysters and scald tliem in strong salt and water; skim them out and throw into cold water ; scald vinegar well and whole peppers; let it get cold. Put the oysters in a stone jar; make liquor to cover them of water they were scalded in, and vinegar. A cup of vin- egar to one quart liquor, to he used cold. BEINE THAT PEESEEYES BUTTEE A YEAE. Mrs. D. McCranev. To three gallons of brine strong enough to bear an egg, add one-quarter pound good loaf sugar, and one tablespoonful of saltpetre ; boil the brine, and when it is cold strain carefully. Pack butter closely in small jars, and allow the brine to cover the butter to the depth of at least four inches. This completely excludes the air. If practicable make your butter into small roles, wrap each carefully in a clean muslin cloth, tying up with a string ; place a weight over the butter to keep it all sub- merged in the brine. This mode is most recommended by those who have tried both.

256 THE HOME COOK BOOK. GRAPE JAM. Mrs. S. W. Cheever. Take your grapes, separate the skin from the pulp, keeping them in separate dishes, put the pulps in your preserving kettle with a teacup of water; when thorough- ly heated, run them through a colander to separate the seeds: then put your skins with them and weigh; to each pound of fruit, put three-fourths of a pound of sugar; add merely water enough to keep from burning. cook slowly three-fourths of an hour. This is a delicious jam, and worth the trouble. BLACKBERRY JAM. M. A. T. To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a pound of sugar ; mash each separately; then put together and boil from one-half to three-fourths of an hour. RASPBERRY JAM. To five or six pounds of fine red raspberries (not too ripe) add an equal quantity of the finest quality of white sugar. Mash the whole well in a preserving kettle ; add about one quart of currant juice (a little less will do), and boil gently until it jellies upon a cold plate; then put into small jars; cover with brandied paper, and tie a thick white paper over them. Keep in a dark, dry, and cool place.

Time required to boil poultry : a chicken will take about 20 minutes ; a fowl about 40 minutes ; a small turkey an hour and a half; a large turkey two hours or more. BOILED FOWL. Take a young fowl and fill the inside with oysters ; place in a jar and plunge into a kettle of water ; boil for one and one-half hours ; there will be a quantity of gravy in the jar from the juice of the fowl and the oysters ; make this into a white sauce with the addition of egg, cream, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters, or serve up plain with the fowl. This is very nice with the addition of a little parsley to the sauce.

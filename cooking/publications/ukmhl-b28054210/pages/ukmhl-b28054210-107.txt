Take your bones, and stew them in a little water with an onion, some salt and pepper, and, if you like, a little savoury herbs; when the goodness is all out of the bones, and it tastes nice, thicken the gravy with a tea- spoonful of corn starch, and if it is not very strong put in a bit of butter, then place your stew pan on the hot hearth, and put in your slices of meat. Warm but not boil. Serve with toasted bread. SPICED YEAL. Mxs. C. E. Brown.

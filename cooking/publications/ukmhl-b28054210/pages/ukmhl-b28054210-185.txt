VALUABLE RECIPE8. 179 PUDDINGS. Mrs. Upham. Appi a Float.—A pint of stewed, well-mashed apples, the whites of three eggs beaten to a still froth, four large tablespoonsful of sugar; then add the apples and sugar alternately, a spoonful of each, and beat all together until it stands ujj perfectly stiff; it will swell immensely. Serve this in saucers on a custard made of the yolks of the eggs, one pint of milk, two table- sp jonsful of sugar, and flavour with vanilla. Apple Meringue.—Prepare a pudding dish two- thirds full of nice sour apples, add one and one-half cups of water, and one cup of brown sugar, and some salt. Cover closely, and let them simmer in the oven until done to a mash. Beat the whites of five eggs, one cup of sugar, and the juice of a lemon, until they are a stiff froth ; pour over the apples and set in the oven to brown. Peaches or other canned fruits are very nice. The yolks of the eggs make a rich custard if beaten and stirred into a quart of boil- ing milk. Sweeten, season, and pour oyer it. SUET PUDDING. Mbs M.

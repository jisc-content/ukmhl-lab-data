One-third of the lump may be taken for rolls, which can be made by working in butter the size of an egg, and setting aside to rise again: when light the second time make out in oblong shapes ; cover them with a cloth and let them rise again. As soon as they break apart bake in a quick oven. They will not fail to be nice if they are baked as soon as they seam. This is the great secret of white, flaky rolls.

The sponge is made over night in the centre of a pan of flour, with milk and warm water and a cup of home- made hop and potato yeast to about four loaves. The yeast is put in when about half the flour and water are mixed, and then the remainder of the water is added and the sponge beaten with a wooden spoon for fifteen minutes and left to rise over night in a moderately warm place. In the morning, the bread-dough mixed and kneaded for half an hour, adding flour to make a stiff dough, and left to rise in a mass. It is then made into small loaves, being kneaded with as little flour as possible, and put in pans to rise the second time, all the while kept moderately warm and when light bake in a moderately hot oven. The important part of said recipe is the beating of the sponge fifteen minutes, as given.

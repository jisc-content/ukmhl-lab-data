Three pounds of lean veal, two eggs, six small butter crackers, one tablespoon of thyme, one of salt, one of pepper, two of milk; knead it like bread, and bake it two hours in a slow oven, basting it with butter often, then slice for tea. CHEESE SCALLOP. Soak one cup of dry bread crumbs in fresh milk. Beat into this three eggs; add one tablespoon of butter and one-half a pound of grated cheese ; strew upon the top sifted bread crumbs, and bake in the oven a delicate brown. An excellent relish when eaten with thin slices of bread and butter. FISH RELISH. After Marion Harland. One cup of drawn butter with an egg beaten in, two hard boiled eggs, mashed potato (a cup will do), one cup of cold fish (cod, halibut, or shad), roe of cod or shad, and one teaspoon of butter, one teaspoon of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste. Method: Dry the roe previously well boiled; mince the fish fine and season; wash up the roe with the butter and the yolks of the boiled eggs ; cut the white into thin rings; put a layer of mashed potatoes at the bottom of a deep buttered dish; then alternate layers of fish; drawn butter with the rings of the whites imbedded in this roe; more potato at top; cover and set in the oven until it smokes and

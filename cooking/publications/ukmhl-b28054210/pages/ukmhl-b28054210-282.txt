THE HOME COOK BOOK. 27 G GRAHAM BEE AD. Mrs. H. P. Stowell. Set sponge of fine flour, same as for -wheat bread; when sufficiently raised, instead of mixing with fine flour, oaix with Graham to the usual consistency; mould with fine flour a little, raise once, then it is ready for the Dven. Sweeten with syrup or sugar, if desired, though I think it better without either. EOLLS. Mrs. H. F. Waiter To the quantity of light bread dough that you would take for twelve persons, add the white of one egg well beaten, two tablespoons of white sugar, and two table- spoons of butter ; work these thoroughly together ; roll out about half an inch thick ; cut the size desired, and spread one with melted butter and lay another upon the top of it. Bake delicately, when they have risen. FRENCH ROLLS. Mrs. Thos. Orton. Take one-half cup of yeast, rub a small one-half cup of butter in the flour (you will have to guess the quantity), then add the yeast, and water enough to wet; mix as for soda biscuit. Let it rise till morning. Roll in thin sheets, and cut into squares, spread a very little butter on each, and sprinkle a little flour on to roll up. Put in the pan when light, bake twenty minutes. Nice*.

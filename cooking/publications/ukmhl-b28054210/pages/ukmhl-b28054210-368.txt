THE HOME COOK BOOK. 362 AN EXCELLENT HARD SOAP. Mra. Kate Johnson. Pour twelve quarts soft boiling water on two and one- half pounds of unslacked lime; dissolve five pounds sal soda in twelve quarts soft hot water; then mix and let them remain from twelve to twenty-four hours. Pour off all the clear fluid, being careful not to allow any of the sediment to run off; boil three and one-half pounds clean grease and three or four ounces of rosin in the above lye till the grease disappears; pour into a box and let it stand a day to stiffen and then cut in bars. It is as well to put the lime in all the water and then add the soda. After pouring off the fluid, add two or three gallons of water and let it stand with the lime and soda dregs a day or two. This makes an excellent washing fluid to boil or soak the clothes in, with one pint in a boiler of water. CLEANING SILVER. Mrs. 0. L. Parker. Never put a particle of soap about your silver if you would have it retain its original lustre. When it wants polish, take a piece of soft leather and whiting and rub hard. The proprietor of one of the oldest silver estab- lishments in the city of Philadelphia says that house- keepers ruin their silver in soap suds, as it makes it look like pewter. POLISH FOR ZINC OR TIN. Mrs. Thos. A. Hill. To three pints of water, add one ounce of nitric acid.

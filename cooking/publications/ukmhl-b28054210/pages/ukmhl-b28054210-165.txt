SOUTHEEN WAY OF BOILING EICE. Mrs. Stotesbury. Tick over the rice ; rinse it in cold water until perfectly clean, then put it in a pot of boiling water, allowing a quart of water to less than a teacup of rice ; boil it hard seventeen minutes ; drain off the water very close, and let it steam fifteen minutes with the lid off. When care- fully done in this way, each kernel of rice stands out by itself, while it is perfectly tender. The water in which the rice has been boiled makes, it is said, good starch tor muslin, if boiled a few minutes by itself.

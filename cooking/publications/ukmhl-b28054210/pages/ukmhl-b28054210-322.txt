THE HOME COOK BOOK. 316 WEDDING CAKE. Mrs. Upliam. Five pounds of seeded raisins, two pounds of cur* rants, one pound of citron, twelve eggs, one pound of butter, one pound sugar (brown), one coffee-cup of molasses, a little brandy, one tea-cup of spices. ICEING FOE ANY CAKE. Mrs. Upliam. Instead of beating the eggs to a stiff froth, as is gem erally the case, take four tablespoons of sugar to the egg, and stir thoroughly; then spread on cake; will make a much harder iceing than beating it. CAKE. Mr. Upliam. Cream filled cakes: These delicious cakes are very easily made it care is taken to have the water boiling. Measure out one-half pint and put in *a small kettle; immediately after it comes to a boil again put in two- thirds of a cup of butter and one and a half cups of flour ; stir briskly for a moment, leaving it over the fire; remove this mixture and place in a dish where it will get entirely cold; beat five large fresh eggs very thoroughly, then stir in your cold mixture a spoonful at a time ; stir it all until smooth and free from lumps; drop them upon a greased dripping pan in small pear- shaped cakes ; bake half an hour in a real hot oven; donâ€™t be afraid they will burn unless you see them doing

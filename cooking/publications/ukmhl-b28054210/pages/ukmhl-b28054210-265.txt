The first step in this process is the reduction of sugar to a syrup, which is done by adding water to sugar in the proportion of a pint and a half of water to three and a half pounds of sugar. When this boils up in the kettle we have simple syrup. A few more min- utes of boiling, reduces the water which holds the sugar in a perfect solution. At this stage, if the syrup is al- lowed to cool, the candy crystallizes on the sides of the dish, and we have rock candy. If* instead of allowing it to cool at this point, we allow it to reach a higher dc« gree of heat, we shall find, in putting a spoon into the syrup, when drawing it out a long thread of sugar will follow the spoon. It is to this point that confec- tioners bring the syrup for the greater number of can- dies produced, The greatest skill is required on the part of the operator to push the boiling sugar to this point without allowing it to reach the caramel state, when it becomes bitter and dark and is no longer fit to use as a confection. The proportion of sugar and water for candy making will be three and one-half pounds of sugar to one and one-half pints of water. To this add one teaspoon of cream of tartar, which will irrevent the

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 216 cnps of milk, one teaspoon of butter, and two of ginger, added last. This makes two pies. SQUASH PIE. Mrs. L. EE. Dayis. Two teacups of boiled squash, three-fourths teacup of brown sugar, three eggs, two tablespoons of molasses, one tablespoon melted butter, one tablespoon ginger, one teaspoon of cinnamon, two teacups of milk, a little salt. Make two plate pies. CUSTARD PIE. Mrs. E. E. Marcv. Make a custard of the yolks of three eggs with milk, season to the taste; bake it in ordinary crust; put it in a brick oven, that the crust may not be heavy, and as soon as that is heated remove it to a place in the oven of a more moderate heat, that the custard may bake slowly and not curdle ; when done, beat the whites to a froth; add sugar and spread over the top, and return to the oven to brown slightly; small pinch ot salt added to a custard heightens the flavour; a little soda in the crust prevents it from being heavy. Very nice. TORONTO PIE. Mrs. D. One cup of sugar, three eggs, one and one half cups of flour, one teaspoon of baking powder; flavour to taste; bake as for jelly cake in layers, and spread between the layers raspberry jam.

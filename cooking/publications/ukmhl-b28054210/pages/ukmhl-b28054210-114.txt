THE HOME COOK BOOK. 108 crackers, or bread crumbs that have been browned and rolled, and bako in a slow oven for two hours. SALTING PORK. A. M.^G. Cover the bottom of the barrel with salt an inch deep; put down one layer of pork and cover that with salt half an inch thick; continue this until all your pork is disposed of; then cover the whole with strong brine; pack as tight as possible, the rind side down or next to the barrel; keep the pork always under the brine by using an inner cover and clean stones. Should any scum arise, pour off the brine, scald it, and add more salt. Old brine can be boiled down, well skimmed, and used for a fresh supply. CURING HAMS. Mrs. Mulfprd. Hang up the hams a week or ten days, the longer the tenderer and better, if kept perfectly sweet; mix for each good-sized ham, one teacup of salt, one tablespoon of molasses, one ounce of salt-petre ; lay the hams in a clean dry tub ; heat the mixture and rub well into the hams, especially around the bones and recesses ; repeat the process once or twice, or until all the mixture ia used; then let the hams lie two or three days, when they must be put for three weeks in brine strong enough to bear an egg; then soak eight hours in cold water ; hang up to dry in the kitchen or other more convenient place for a week or more; smoke from three to five days, being careful not to heat the hams.

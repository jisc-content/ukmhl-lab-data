131 VALUABLE RECIPES. SPICED TOMATOES. Mrs. Stotesbury. To four pounds of large red tomatoes, take two pounds ca good brown sugar, one pint of cider vinegar, half ounce of cloves, and half ounce of stick cinnamon; stew all together in a preserving kettle until the tomatoes are cooked; take the tomatoes out and put them on dishes to cool, letting the syrup go on simmering slowly; when the tomatoes are cold return them to the syrup for a little while ; let them become cold before putting them in the jars. The syrup must be boiled down as thick as molasses, and poured cold over the tomatoes; tie them down with bladder or waxed paper. PICKLED CUCUMBERS. Mrs. Packard. Wash with care your cucumbers, and place in jars. Make a weak brine (a handful of salt to a gallon and a half of water). When scalding hot, turn over the cucum- bers and cover; repeat this process three mornings in succession, taking care to skim thoroughly. On the fourth day have ready a porcelain kettle of vinegar, to which has been added a piece of alum the size of a wal- nut. When scalding hot, put in as many cucumbers as may be covered with the vinegar; do not let them boil, but skim off as soon as scalded through, and replace with others, adding each time a small piece of alum. When this process is through, throw out the vinegar and replace with good cider or white wine vinegar; add Bpices, mustard seed, and red peppers. Sort the pickles

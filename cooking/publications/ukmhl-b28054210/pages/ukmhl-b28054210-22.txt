THE HOME COOK BOOK. iG many an attack of cramps, coughs and neuralgia. The food must be of the best quality, and she must know that it is. It pays to give an extra shilling on the half barrel for selected potatoes and apples, as they go farther and make more muscle than poor ones, and don’t poison anybody. Sharp scrutiny of eggs, meat, butter, and milk, is a benefit to others as well as her own family, by raising the standard of provisions, besides more direct gain. More disease comes into the world in tho shape of tainted butter and milk, than any one dreams of but the doctors. If she gets the hygienic craze about food, don’t let her carry it to the verge of confounding things “healthful” with things uneatable, for badly cooked eatmeal and graham “gems” are as distressing to deli- cate organisms as the richest mince pie and old cheese together. That slight sour tinge, which nobody noticed, in the home-made bread, that solid pudding, which yet was not quite rejected at dessert, are responsible for the bad breath of the children and the beginning of a sick headache in their elders. Never be satisfied with any but the nicest cooking, with variety enough to make your table a delight as well as a necessity. And don’t let anybody lay it to you that you are pampering your family, and devoting yourself to a low sphere of action. You are doing no such thing, but are giving them strong, active bodies, steady nerves and tempers, and clear brains to meet their work with. By just so much as you neglect your part of the work, they will fail in theirs. You are the engineer to feed the fires, and keep the wheels oiled, and the whole family svstem depends on you. Don’t dare to call such work low*

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 844 CREAM NECTAR. Mrs. John Morse. Four pounds of white sugar, six quarts of water, put over a slow fire, milk warm, acid whites of two eggs well beaten; bring the whole to nearly boiling point; let boil and strain immediately; when cold add six ounces of tartaric acid; flavour with lemon; a wineglass to be used in a tumbler of water ; add half a teaspoonful of baking soda. SODA CREAM. M. G. Hand. Two and one-half pounds white sugar, one-eighth pound tartaric acid, both dissolved in one quart of hot water ; when cold, add the beaten whites of three eggs, stirring well; bottle for use. Put two large spoons of this syrup in a glass of cold water, and stir in it one- fourth of a spoon of bicarbonate of soda. Any flavour can be put in the syrup. An excellent drink for summer. RASPBERRY ACID. Mrs. G. W. Pitkin. Dissolve five ounces of tartaric acid in two quarts of water ; pour it upon twelve pounds of red raspberries in a large bowl; let it stand twenty-four hours ; strain it without pressing; to a pint of this liquor add one and a half pounds of white sugar; stir until dissolves., Bot- tle, but do not cook for several days, when it is ready for use. Two or three tablespoons in a glass of ice water will make a delicious beverage.

A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHERS. V advice which occupy the preliminary pages are extremely valuable, and young housekeepers would do well to read them, even several times. Your compilers appear to have omitted nothing likely to prove beneficial in the manage- ment of the dining-room, the kitchen, and the general household. Too much attention cannot be paid to domes- tic affairs, and habits of rigid economy should be studied. The advice which the authors of this book advance will secure that end if acted upon. I have read your book with much pleasure, and though I know in a little while I shall forget all about the way in which mince pies should be made, or oysters roasted, or pop-corn popped, yet it is a satisfaction to me to know that I once knew how these delicious things were prepared. Finally, I would ask every housekeeper who wishes to add cookery to the other accomplishments which she may possess, to secure a copy of this book. Begin at page 51 and go right through the volume. It is true you may have soup for a month, and pudding for a quarter, and custards, perhaps, all through the year, but what of that, none of them are very bad to take. Yours, gastronomically, Geo. Stewart, Jr.

157 VALUABLE RECIPES. POTATOES FRIED. Mrs. A. Pare potatoes; cut in pieces one-half inch wide, and long as the potato; keep them in cold water till wanted; drop in boiling lard; when nearly done, take them out with a skimmer and drain them; boil up the lard again, and drop them back, and fry till done; this makes them puff up; sprinkle with salt and serve very hot. POTATO CROQUETTES. Take finely mashed potato and mix through it sufficient salt, pepper, and butter to season well, with sweet milk or cream to moisten; mix thoroughly with this one beaten egg, and then make up into small rolls, being careful to have the surface perfectly smooth. Have ready one plate with a beaten egg upon it, and another with cracker crumbs. Dip each roll into the egg and then into the crumbs, and fry of a rich golden brown in hot lard. Lay the croquettes on brown paper first, and serve on a napkin. PARSNIPS. Boil until tender in a little salted water; then take up; skim them, cut in strips, dip in beaten egg, and fry in melted butter or hot lard. TURNIPS. Boil until tender ; mash and season with butter, pep- per, salt, and a little rich milk or cream. Serve with mutton.

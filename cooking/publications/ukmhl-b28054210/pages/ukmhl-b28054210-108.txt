102 THE HOME COOK BOOK. JELLIED YEAL. M. A. T. Boil the veal tender, pick it up fine, put in a mould, add the water it was boiled in, and set it in a cold place ; season with salt and pepper to taste; a layer of hard oiled eggs improves it. FRICANDEAU. Mrs. J. M. Brown and Mrs. M. L. Three and one-half pounds of cold roast veal chopped fine, one tablespoon of salt and one of pepper, one-half of a nutmeg, four or five rolled crackers, three eggs. If the veal is thin, add a piece of butter half as large as an egg, and tablespoon of cream. Form all this in a large roll, and spot the roll over with bits of butter; then strew over it the pounded crackers, (a little of the cracker should be mixed with the meat), put it in the oven, and from time to time add a little water. Cook slowly two hours. When cold, slice thin, and it makes an excellent relish. SWEET BREADS. Scald in salt and water, take out the stringy parld j then put in cold water a few minutes; dry in a towel; dip in egg and bread crumbs, and fry brown in butter ; when done place in a hot dish; pour into the pan a cnp of sweet cream, a little pepper and salt, and a little parsley chopped fine ; add flour, and when boiling pour over the sweet breads ; add mushrooms, if desired.

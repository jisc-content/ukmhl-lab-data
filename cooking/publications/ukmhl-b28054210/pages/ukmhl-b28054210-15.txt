a hx Home Cook Book. HOUSEKEEPING. Word of grace to women; word that makes her the earthly providence of her family, that wins gratitude and attachment from those at homeland a good report of those that are without. Success in housekeeping adds credit to the woman of intellect, and lustre to a womanâ€™s accomplishments. It is a knowledge which it is as dis- creditable for any woman to be without as for a man not to know how to make a living, or how to defend himself when attacked. He may be ever so good an artist, ever eo polished a gentleman; if deficient in these points of aelf-preservation you set him down for a weakling, and his real weight in society goes for very little. So, no matter how talented a woman may be, or how useful in the church or societ}*-, if she is an indifferent house- keeper it is fatal to her influence, a foil to her bjilliancy and a blemish in her garments.

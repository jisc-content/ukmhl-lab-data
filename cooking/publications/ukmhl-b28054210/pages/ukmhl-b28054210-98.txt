DOMESTIC RECEIPTS. TO COOK A HAM (VERY FINE). Mrs. J. Beaty. Boil a common-sized ham four or five hours, then skin the whole and fit it for the table ; then set it in an oven for half an hour, then cover it thickly with pounded rusk or bread crumbs, and set it back for half an hour. Boiled ham is always improved by setting it into an oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat fries out; and this also makes it more tender. TO BOIL A LEG OF YEAL OR MUTTON. Miss Kate B'jaty. Make a stuffing of bread and a quarter as much of salt pork, chopped fine and seasoned with sweet herbs, pepper and salt. Make deep gashes, or, what is better, take out the bone with a carving-knife and fill up with stuffing, and sew up the opening with strong thread. When there is a flap of flesh lap it over the opening and sew it down. Put it into a large pot and fill it with water, putting in a tablespoonful of salt, and let it sim- mer slowly three hours. If it is needful to add water ©o’*r in boiling water

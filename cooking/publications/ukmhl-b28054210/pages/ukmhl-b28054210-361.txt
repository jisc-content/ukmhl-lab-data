Strain out the sediment, and pour out the clear solution of lime into the solution of sal soda. The result will be a thick butter-milk solu- tion, otherwise the lime was not strong enough. Filter this until it is perfectly clear. For leaves, use one part of solution to one part of water ; for ferns, use the solu- tion full strength.

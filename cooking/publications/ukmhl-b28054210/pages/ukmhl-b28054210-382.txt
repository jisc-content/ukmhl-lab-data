VALUABLE RECIPE*. 376 much confidence in this simple remedy that I am will- ing you should give my name in connection with this statement. For Felon.—Take common rock salt, as used for sail- ing down pork or beef, dry in an oven, then pound it fine and mix with spirits of turpentine in equal parts ; put it in a rag and wrap it around the parts affected ,* as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours you are cured. The felon will be dead. No harm to try it, as I have with success. Cure for Neuralgia.—A friend who suffered horrible pains from neuralgia, hearing of a noted physician in Germany who invariably cured the disease, went to him, and was permanently cured after a short sojourn. The doctor gave him the remedy, which was nothing but a poultice and tea made from our common field thistle. The leaves are macerated and used as a poultice on the parts affected, while a small quantity of the same is boiled down to the proportion of a quart to a pint, and a small wine glass of the decoction drank before each meal. Our friend says he has never known it to fail ol giving relief, while in almost every case it has effected a cure. God gave herbs for the healing of the nations. Tincture of Iodine on Corns.—Dr. Bajis states that corns may be rapidly cured by the application of the Tincture of Iodine ; the corn disappearing in the course of a few days, if touched with the Tincture several times a day. If the corn be situated between the toes, it should be covered with a piece of linen steeped in a mixture of the Tincture and Glycerine.—Mrs. C. Patterson.

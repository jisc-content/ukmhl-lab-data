THE HOME COOK BOOK. 1G2 CAULIFLOWER. Mrs. C. Belford. Remove tho leaves ; cut the main stalk close to tkÂ« flower; lay it in boiling milk and water slightly salted, with the stalk down ; when done, take out carefully and drain in a colander, then place in the vegetable dish and pour over it a rich drawn butter dressing. ESCALOPED TOMATOES. Put into an earthen baking dish a layer of cracker crumbs and small bits of butter; then a layer of toma- toes with a very little sugar sprinkled over them ; then another layer of cracker crumbs seasoned with butter, and a layer of tomatoes, until your dish is full, with the cracker crumbs at the top; pour over all this a little water to moisten, and bake half an hour. STEWED TOMATOES. Mrs. Saulter. Put ripe tomatoes into hot water and skin them; then throw them into an earthen stew pan, (a new tin will do, but not so good); cut up and let the tomatoes cook gently a few minutes; season with butter, pepper, salt, and serve. Or you may add bread crumbs and sugar to the tomatoes if preferred. Some cooks stew tomatoes tor a long time, but the flavour is finer if allowed to sim- mer but a few moments, just sufficient time to heat well through.

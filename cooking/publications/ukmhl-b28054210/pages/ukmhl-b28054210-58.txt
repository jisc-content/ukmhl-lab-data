SUET SOUP. MADE WITHOUT MEAT. In your soup pot put about a quarter of a pound of butter, set on the stove, slice into it four large onions ; fry them a nice brown, stirring all the time. Now put in four quarts of cold water, one large coffee cupful of split peas previously washed ; boil four hours. Before serving stir smartly with your potato-masher, strain through a colander into your tureen. Many like tomato catsup in this, but it is better to serve that separate. TO KEEP STOCK FOR SOUP.

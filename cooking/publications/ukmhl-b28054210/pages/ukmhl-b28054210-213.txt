FRUIT PIE. fclra. L P. Car:''/. Must be baked in a two-quart tin basin ; to give it tho right shape the basin must be of nearly the same size top and bottom ; first make a nice pie crust; put a layer of it in the bottom, but not around the side of the dish; then a layer of chopped sour apples, two inches thick; then a layer of chopped raisins; sprinkle sugar over this, pieces of butter, and any spice you likeâ€”cloves and nutmeg are nice; another layer of crust and fruit, etc., until your dish is full; put a crust on the top; bake slowly for two hours ; when done, turn bottom upwards on a plate, and before putting it on the table sprinkle fine sugar over it. It is quite as good when warmed again as when first baked. It takes one pound of raisins, ten or twelve good sized apples, two large cups of sugar, more if you like.

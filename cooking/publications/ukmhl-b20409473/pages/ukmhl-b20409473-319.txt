ON DISHING UP DESSERT-STANDS. 271 oval or round fruit stand or basket, is to see that you have all the requisite accessories needed for the piu'- pose ready to your hand; these consist of either rounds or ovals of stout pasteboard, which should be of graduated sizes, and in number about three or four, and also some dyed moss and vine or other green leaves. The broadest round of pasteboard should have a cylindrical tube of the same, securely stuck in its centre, to rest on the bottom of the interior of the vase or basket, so as to afford a solid base to the whole structure; this is to be covered with a bed of moss of about half-an-incli in thickness, and the larger fruits are first to be disposed all round, near the edge, at half- an-inch distance from each other; the interstices are to be filled up with moss; fill in the centre of this first row with a close bed of moss, and place a smaller round of pasteboard upon it, and then continue to finish building up the edifice by raising one tier above another, gradually diminishing the circles as you pro- ceed until the summit is just wide enough to receive a fine peach, or some other similar sized fruit: the smaller sorts of fruits, such ^^is cherries, currants, medlars, strawberries, &c., are to be introduced in between the angles of the larger fruits. A pine apple is often used to crown the summit of a basket of fruit. In winter, such fruits as the season or hot-hou^ afford must, of course, be dished up somewhat in the manner directed above.

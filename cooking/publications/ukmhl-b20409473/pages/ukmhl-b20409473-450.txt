^86 THE ART OF CONFECTIONAEY. Ho. 802—Variegated Ice Bricks. Fill the brick moulds with any three kinds of water or cream ice, or of these mixed: such as strawberry water, vanilla cream and pistachio cream, or chocolate, peach and pine apple, and when frozen stiff, cut them in slices, and dish them up in a pyramidal form. No. 803.—Imitation Fruits moulded with Ice. All kinds of water or cream ices are equally adapted for this purpose : for the sort of moulds, see Adams's Illustrations of ice moulds. To insure success, the best plan is to unmould the ices an hour before serving them, placing them in an ice cave to stiffen them; this precaution tends to preserve their distinct shape a much longer time. 'No, 804.—Imitation Pine-Apple composed of Ice. A pewter mould in the shape of a pine apple will be required for this purpose, and a quart of pine apple water or cream ice (more or less, according to the size of the mould) should be prepared with which to fill the mould : this is to be imbedded in rough ice, and about a dozen imitation fruit moulds are likewise to be prepared for the purpose of being grouped on the ice stand or dish, to serve as a base for the pine apple ice to be raised upon. The crown and stalk palms of the pine are to be imitated with preserved green angelica. The imitation fruits are to be moulded according to directions given in the foregoing number.

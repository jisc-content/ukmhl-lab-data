THE AUT OF CONFECTIONARY. 70 a slow fire. By the words simmer, as here applied, it is intended to convey an idea which perhaps would be better expressed by saying that the syrup when on the fire should be allowed to attain that degree of heat only which would cause it to tremble at the side of the pan. Let it be distinctly remembered that, when any fruits are being preserved whole for drying or otherwise, they must not be allowed to boil, other- wise they would burst. Thus, the cherries having been simmered, put them with their syrup away, covered over in a white jpan until the next day; the syrup must then be drawn off, boiled up, skimmed, and poured back to the cherries. The syrup must be thus boiled up twice more, making in all what we term giving four fashions of sugar. On the fourth day drain the cherries on a cane sieve entirely free from any excess of moisture, strew them thinly, and apart from each other upon bright clean wire trays resting on dishes, and place them in the screen to dry—slow heat, for if the heat should be excessive, it darkens the cherries. The beauty of this, and all dried fruits, consists in their light colour. As soon as the cherries are sufficiently dry, that is, when on being touched they do not stick to your fingers, they must be withdrawn from the screen, and when cold, may be packed away in boxes lined with clean paper. Note.—All kinds of small plums may be treated in the same way as cherries; those received from the south-western provinces of France termed pistoles are prepared in this way; and previously to their being packed in small round boxes are pressed flat betwixt the index and the thumb.

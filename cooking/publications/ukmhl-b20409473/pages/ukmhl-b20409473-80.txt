Ho. 95.—How to dish up Compotes. In dishing up all round fruits forming compotes, it is necessary to begin by placing the centre piece of the compote; and on the contrary, when dishing up pears, or fruits cut in ovals, or oblongs, commence by placing the outer circle first, finishing Vvith the centre piece. In all cases wherein compotes require the addition of syrup, this should be perfectly bright, and should be XDOured upon, or round them, only just before sending to table. ITo. 96—To clarify Sugar for Compotes. Break four pounds of the finest loaf sugar into small lumps, put this into an untinned copper pan, commonly called a sugar boiler, (see Adamses Illus- trations,) add one quart of cold water Vvdiisked up with half a white of egg, stir all together, and allow it to stand by until the sugar is completely dissolved; the pan may then be placed on the fire, and the sugar stirred with an untinned copper spoon till it begins to boil; it must then be removed to the side of the stove, and, as it continues to boil up at the side of the pan, pour in occasionally, at different times, the value of another pint of cold water; this will drive up the egg.

CREAM ICES IN GENERAL. 351 the flavouring are mixed, they must be quickly and continuously stirred while on the fire until the com- position begins to thicken; the composition should then be removed from the fire and stirred till it has become sufficiently thick and smooth, and then rubbed through a sieve into a basin. No. 727—Pine Apple Cream Ice. Ingredients: 1 lb. of pine apple pulp, made by peeling, grating, cutting up small, or pounding and rubbing the pulp through a hair sieve, 12 oz. of sugar, li pint of milk or cream, and 8 yolks of eggs.

You now commence working the ice by twisting or twirling the freezer in a circular rotatory motion, first one way and then the other, from right to left, and left to right: this twirling motion causes the contents of the freezer to congeal more quickly. The ice must be stirred and

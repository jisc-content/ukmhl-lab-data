PLAIN CAKES AND BREAKFAST ROLLS, ETC. 171 manner, add the remainder of the tepid milk by degrees, working the dough vigorously with one hand, into an elastic smooth body: you then gather up the paste, divide it into as many equal parts as may be calculated to produce the intended sized rolls, and with flour on the slab, use your hands to mould these—either round or oval shaped, and place them on baking-sheets, or in roll tins [see Adams' Illustrations]; cover them over with paper, and set them in a warm place free from any current of air, to rise; they are then to be brushed over with milk, and baked in tolerably sharp heat. This dough may also be made up in a variety of fancy shapes, such as twists, rings, half-moons, &c. No. 383—German Bolls.

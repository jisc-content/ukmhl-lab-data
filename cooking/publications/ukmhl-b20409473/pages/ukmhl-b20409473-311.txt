ON DISHING UP DESSERT-STANDS. 265 or stand, and having a cylindrical band of pasteboard to support its raised position in the dish. A neatl}^ arranged bed of dyed moss, about half an inch thick, should be carefully spread, with the curled part of the moss on the edges of the dishes, and the fruit raised in pyramidal groups upon it; moss being placed between the fruits to give solidity in raising the pyramid. The most choice specimens should be se- lected with which to crown the edifice. No. 565.—How to Bish. up Cherries. The circular piece of pasteboard being safely fitted to the dish or stand, and a firmly arranged bed of moss placed thereon, this is to be neatly covered with vine leaves of equal size, so placed as to present their pointed ends to the edge of the dish. Upon this bed the cherries are to be built up in pyramidal shape— either square or triangular—finishing in a point at the summit, in exactly the same manner as you may have noticed cannon balls piled in an arsenal. To facilitate the dishing up of this fruit, the stalks of the cherries must be cut to within an inch of the fruit. Cherries may also be dished up in the form of a circular cone, and in this instance it is safest to com- mence building a small cone in the centre of the dish, and afterwards to complete the dish by raising other cherries round it. When dishing up cherries in a square or triangular pyramidal form, it is necessary to commence placing the fruit on the outer part of the base, and to narrow the squares or angles as you raise the tiers until the edifice reaches to a point.

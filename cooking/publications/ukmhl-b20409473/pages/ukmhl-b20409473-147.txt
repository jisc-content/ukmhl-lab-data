ON DESSERT CAKES IN GENERAL. 107 Note.—Ground almonds are sold at Crosse and Blackwell's, Soho Square, ready prepared for all such purposes; yet, as these are sometimes oily, it is better that you should prepare the almonds yourself. No. 253.—Swedish Macaroons. Ingredients: 12 oz. of shred almonds, 4 oz. of ground almonds, 4 oz. Brown and Poison's Indian corn flour, 1 IB. of fine sugar, two whole eggs, the zest or rind of two oranges rubbed on sugar. Mix the whole of these ingredients in a basin until thoroughly incorporated, then roll out the paste or mixture in balls the size of a small walnut, place these upon sheet wafer laid out on baking sheets, push in the oven, moderate heat, and bake the swedes of a light colour. No. 254.—Swedish Macaroons another way. Prepare the paste as directed in the foregoing num- ber, spread it out a quarter of an inch thick on sheet wafer laid out on baking sheets, push in the oven, mo- derate heat, bake of a light colour, and when done, and before they are cold, with a sharp tin cutter, stamp out the macaroons in the form of leaves, or crescents, bend these across a rolling pin, and when thoroughly cold and crisp, they may be removed and kept in a box in a dry temperature.

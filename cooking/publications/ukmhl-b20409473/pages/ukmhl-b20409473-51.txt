HOW TO BOTTLE FRUITS. 11 pine into a three-pound jar (supposing that the pine may weigh about one pound and a half), fill the inside and all round the fruit with pounded sugar, cover the jar with a lid or paper, and place it in the screen, moderate heat, and allow it to remain there until the sugar is dissolved into a syrup; then fill up the jar with more sugar, and as soon as this second lot has also become dissolved into a syrup, the jar may be covered down in the usual way, and set aside in the cool. Note.—If, when peeling the pine-apples, you at first remove the roughest portion of the exterior only, you may then pare off the rind a little thicker without fear of v^aste, as the rind can be placed in bottles and preserved according to either of the foregoing methods, and will become useful for making ices, <!reams, flavouring punch, &c. No. 26.—To preserve Apples for India. Newtown Pippins, Eibstons, Russets, Golden Pippins, Wellingtons, and all apples of firm texture and rich flavoured, are best suited for this purpose. Let the apples intended for preserving in this manner be cut in halves, or quarters, with the cores neatly removed, turned or peeled smooth, and placed immediately out of hand in their bottles; fill up each bottle with twenty-four degrees syrup, as soon as its quantity of fruit is complete, to preserve the apples from becoming discoloured; cork, and tie down. Time : twenty-five minutes' ebullition.

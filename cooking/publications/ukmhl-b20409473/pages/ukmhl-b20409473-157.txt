MASSEPAINS AND ALMOND CAKES. 117 filberts in the screen for a few minutes only, in order not to damage the colour of the icing. No. 274—Walnut Rout Cakes. Prepare the paste as in No. 272, leave one-third in its natural state, and colour the remainder of a light brown with grated chocolate and ground cloves ; use a cut board representing the model of half the shell of a walnut, to push into the hollow form of the shell a small piece of the brown paste, and cut the surplus off level with the board; take out the model carefully, and place it with the fiat part downwards upon a waxed baking plate, to be dried, and afterwards baked. Use some of the uncoloured paste to model the kernels in like manner; dry and bake these also, and when both parts of the walnut are complete, stick them together so as to represent a walnut, the upper part of which has been shelled: they are then to be dried a little longer in the screen. No. 275.—Almond Faggot Rout Cakes. Prepare the paste as in No. 272, roll it out thin, cut it in bands measuring Ij inch in width, cut these in straw-like shreds, gather up a dozen of them in a straight bunch, tie them together with a shred of the same paste, and, as they are turned out of hand, place tlie faggots in rows upon a waxed baking plate; dry them until the next day, and then bake them of a very light colour.

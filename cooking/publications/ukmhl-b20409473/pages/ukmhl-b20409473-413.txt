ON ENGRAVED BOAEDS FOR GUM PASTE, ETC. 349 with thin pliant white paper in the following manner :â€” First cut a circular piece of paper the size of a large or small plate or saucer, according to the capacity of the mould, and press this round piece of paper upon the rounded part of the mould, so as to give it a saucer-like shape; this will then fit closely into the bottom of the mould; a broad band of paper cut to the depth of the mould will serve to line the sides. The mould thus prepared previously to filling in the ice, facilitates the delivery of the bomb. When about to turn out or unmould the bomb, a long knife should be carefully passed all round in between the ice and the sides of the mould, to free and loosen any adhering portion; the bomb will then easily deliver by turning the mould upside down with a sudden jerk of the wrists; when dished up the papers must of course be removed.

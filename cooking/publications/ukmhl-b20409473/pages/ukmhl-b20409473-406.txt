342 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. ice-water from wasting. These tubs should be painted both inside and out, not merely for appearance sake, but also on account of the rust which necessarily would collect on the hoops, and soil everything ap- proaching them. It is necessary to possess three sizes of tubs, adapted to the dimensions of different sized freezing- pots, each tub admitting of a space of at least two inches intervening between the inside of the tub and the freezer, to receive the rough ice in the circular cavity thus formed. E"o. 707.—The Large Tub for holding several Freezers. This tub very much resembles a common washing- tub, and differs principally in having iron hoops, and that instead of rising handles, it has merely pro- jecting holds from the edges. These larger tubs are required when several freezers are to be set in motion at one time : the fact of their being all in the same tub will enable one person to work them alternately with more ease and expedition than when set up separately. The large tubs are also useful for freezing-blocks, or coloured water stands, for dishing up various kinds of ices, as already explained in Nos. 614 and 615. No. 708.—Ice Crushers. A large-headed pestle, fastened to a strong handle about three feet long, is useful to pound or crush large quantities of rough ice ; a common wooden mallet will also be found very handy for this purpose.

THE ART OF CONFECTIONAEY. 310 to imitate; yon must also draw out a scale for the foundation, as a guide for cutting out the different parts required to complete the whole. Nothing should be hurried when you are composing any kind of ornament; and it is wrong to attempt anything of the sort, unless you have plenty of leisure time patiently and carefully to carry out your design. The stands or foundations upon which pieces-montees are usually raised are composed of a variety of forms, representing rocks, pedestals, arches, bridges, &c.: these are made up in different substances. Eock-stands for a fountain or temple, for instance, are often made of different coloured parts of Savoy biscuit, which should be prepared in the following manner:â€”Take twenty eggs, one pound of sugar, one pound of flour; proceed in the usual way, and when the batter is ready, divide it into four equal parts, and colour three, each separately, one red, another green, a third brown with grated chocolate, leaving the fourth white; finally mix all together gently, so as to give the whole a marbled pattern or appearance, and bake it in a paper case. When done, pull the biscuit gently to pieces in rock-like shapes; dry these thoroughly in the screen, and use them to build up what are called rock-stands. A foundation representing rough hewn arches, made with confectioners' paste (baked of course), must first be erected on a circular or square flat, made also of the same paste. The rock is to be stuck together with gum paste mastic; gum paste, coloured in different shades of green, brown, and yellow, and pushed through a coarse wire sieve, will produce imitation

108 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. No. 255.—Sticks of Vanilla. Ingredients : 4 oz. of sifted sugar, 4 oz. of flour, 4 yolks of eggs, li oz. of butter dissolved, a table- spoonful of vanilla sugar (No. 199). First, work the sugar, vanilla, and yolks of eggs in a basin for ten minutes; then add the flour and the butter, work all together vigorously until well incor- porated ; fill a biscuit or macaroon forcer with some of the paste, using a tin piping funnel, the point of which should be of the same width as a stick of vanilla; push out the paste on a table strewn with sifted sugar; cut the piping in four or five inch lengths, and lay these out straight, in rather close parallel rows upon a baking sheet previously sparingly rubbed all over with white wax; (the baking sheet m^ust be first warmed). When all the paste is laid out as directed, fill a paper cornet with royal icing (No. 202), strongly flavoured with vanilla sugar, and push or pipe the icing upon these sticks of paste ; when completed, push in the oven, moderate heat, and bake them of a light colour. No. 256.—Sticks of Cinnamon. Prepare the paste as in the preceding case, using cinnamon sugar instead of vanilla; and flavour the icing with cinnamon sugar also. No. 257.—Clneen's Cakes, or Hearts. Ingredients: 8 oz. of flour, 6 oz. of sugar, 6 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of cleansed currants, the zest of two lemons, and 4 eggs.

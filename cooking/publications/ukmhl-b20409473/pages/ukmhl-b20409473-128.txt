88 THE AET OF CONFECTIONARY. No. 219.—How to Shred Almonds. The almonds being skinned, cut them lengthwise in thin shreds by dividing each almond in this way into five or six long shreds. No. 220.—To Shred Almonds another way. Instead of shredding the almonds lengthwise as directed in the preceding case, cut them thinly cross- wise, thus rendering the shreds shorter. No. 221.—Chopped Almonds. When the almonds are freed from their hulls or skins, use a large knife to chop them more or less finely according to the purpose for which they are required. No. 222.—To Pound Almonds. After scalding the almonds and removing the skins, let them soak in cold water for an hour; this in a measure will prevent them from becoming oily while being pounded. When soaked, pound the almonds in a mortar, adding occasionally a few drops of water or orange-flower water, and when thoroughly pulverised into a softish pulp they will be ready. No. 223.—To Colour Almonds. When the almonds are shred, or chopped, add any colour required to be produced, rub them together until every part has become equally saturated with the colour, and then dry them in the screen.

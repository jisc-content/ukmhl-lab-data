65 COMPOTES IN GENERAL. prevent the crusts from sticking and becoming hiirnt; they should be glossed with the sugar,—on one side at least,—and, as they are finished out of hand, place them, the brighest side uppermost, on a wire drainer in the cool. To dish up this compote, a little Spanish branco, No. 161, should be strewn at the bottom of the compotier, and also a small heap (vermicellied through a wire sieve) in the centre ; build the glossy crusts round the branco in three graduated tiers, using apricot jam to make them hold together in the desired position: fill up the centre with vermicellied branco, and strew cinnamon sugar over this, leaving the crusts perfectly glossy. Pour some orange syrup round the base. No. 164.—Compote of Spanish Vermicelli. Break eight fresh eggs into a perforated flat tin strainer (see Adams' Illustrations), dividing the yolks with the shell, and gently rub them through with the point of a spoon into a basin.

ON DESSERT CAKES IN GENERAL. 109 Work the batter in a basin until it creams, then work in the sugar, afterwards the flour and the eggs, and lastly the currants and the flavouring; and when all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated, use the batter to fill small deep pans or moulds (heart- shaped tins are usually chosen for this purpose) previously buttered inside; dredge their surfaces with sugar, push in the oven, and bake the cakes of a light colour; and when done, turn them out of their moulds upon a wire tray. These cakes may be iced, glace No. 258—Clueen^s Drops. Prepare the paste as in the foregoing case, and use a biscuit forcer, to lay out the drops in small round balls the size of a walnut upon paper, dredge them over with sugar, and bake them of a light colour. When the drops are done, remove them from the paper by slipping a knife under them. No. 259.—Genoese Paste. The ingredients for making this paste are the same as for pound cake. No. 231; but, when intended to be converted into Genoese, the paste must be spread out on a baking sheet lined with thin buttered paper. The thickness of the Genoese depends entirely on the purpose for which it may be required; in any case it must be baked of a light colour. Instructions will be hereafter given for a great ^variety of cakes, the foundation of which consists of this kind of paste.

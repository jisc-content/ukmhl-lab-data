4G THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. "No, 109.—Compote of Apples Grilles. A compote is said to be grille, when it has under- gone the following joi'ocess:—When it happens that 3^ou have the remains of compotes of apples or pears having lost their original whiteness, put them in a flat pan, or a sautapan for instance, and set the pan over a brisk fire that the accompanying syrup may thus be boiled down quickly to a light coloured caramel; use a fork to roll gently and carefully each -piece of apple in the caramelled syrup, in order that the rounded part may present an even glossy surface; and as they are thus glazed out of hand, let them be dished up at once in their compotier; just before sending to table, pour a little curacoa round the base of the fruit. !N"o. 110.—Compote of Apple Paste. Reduce sufficient marmalade of apples to serve your purpose; colour one half pink with a few drops of cochineal, and spread each lot about half an inch thick upon clean plates, and set them aside to become stiff and cold. When cold, cut out the marmalade with a knife, or with a tin cutter, in squares, diamonds, rings, ovals, leaves, &c.; use a fork to dip each of these in some caramelled syrup, and as each piece is so dipped, place it out of hand upon a trelliced ware drainer resting on a dish; and when all are complete, put them in the screen to dry for twenty minutes. Dish up this compote pyramidally^ and pour a little cinnamon liqueur round the base.

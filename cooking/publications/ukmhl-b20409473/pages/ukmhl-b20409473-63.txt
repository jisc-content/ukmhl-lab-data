Peel and slice up the pears into a pan containing acidulated water; and as soon as all are ready, drain the fruit on a sieve, put it into a preserving pan with a pint of water to twelve or fifteen pounds of fruit; stir over the fire until the pears are sufficiently done to admit of their being rubbed through a coarse hair sieve into a white pan; add four ounces of pounded sugar to each pound of pulp; mix, fill the bottles,, cork and tie down. Time : ten minutes' ebullition.

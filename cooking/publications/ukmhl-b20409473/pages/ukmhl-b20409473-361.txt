IMITATION HAMS, WEDDING CAKE, ETC. 297 has arrived at its proper degree, it is desirable that the flame or heat, should not reach higher up the sides of the pan than the sugar itself; to this end, a rim of iron or tin, having a hole in the centre of just suffi- cient capacity to admit the bottom of the sugar boiler, should be placed over the stove; by this means, the whole heat of the stove being concentrated under the sugar boiler, the sugar would consequently be boiled all the quicker and whiter; a consideration of the highest importance. The degree of sugar required for making baskets, vases, &c., is the crack; but when intended for spinning, it is necessary to give it an extra boil, to enable it to keep the shape or form to be given. For spinning, two silver table forks should be tied together, the ends of the prongs being dipped in the sugar; with the right hand, shake or whisk the sugar off, to and fro, quickly upon the back of a large knife; and when you have spun a certain quantity, cut off the knotted ends, and use the silken threads to form the intended sub- ject. If your object is to make a plain sultana or basket, the sugar must be spun across and about a mould previously rubbed with a spare quantity of oil of almonds. When any design is required to be pro- duced on the outside of a mould, the design should be first traced out accurately with chalk upon the mould, and a pointed stick, or the end of a spoon, being dipped in the sugar, this should be drawn in thick threads over the tracing. The sugar while boiling, may be coloured of any shade of colour, using for the purpose, wet colours, adapted to the proposed tint. It is a delusion to imagine that ornaments made of spun

THE ABT OF CONFECTIONAKY. 138 must be formed to their long oval shape; use egg- plum or greengage jam to stick them together, and also to mask them over with; gloss or glacez the cakes with transparent icing, No. 206, very slightly tinged with spinach green, No. 193; and, by drying the egg- plums when finished in the screen, the heat will so change the colour as to give them the semblance of ripe fruit. No. 317.--Greengage Biscuits. Prepare these also in the manner indicated for peach biscuits, keeping them of the size and form of the plums; stick the two halves together with greengage jam, cover them all over with the same, and hold them on a silver fork to dip them entirely in transparent icing. No. 208, coloured with spinach green; when they are dried in the usual way, stick in a thin twig of green angelica to form their stalks, and add the bloom as directed for peaches. No. 318.—Magnum Bonum Biscuits. Prepare in the first instance as directed for peaches, keeping the size and form of the cakes to the shape of these large plums; use plum or damson jam to stick the two halves together, and also to mask the plums; glacez them with high coloured transparent icing—using carmine mixed with a very little ultra- marine blue to give the natural plum colour; when dry, add the bloom with fine sugar very lightly laid on in places with a camel hair brush.

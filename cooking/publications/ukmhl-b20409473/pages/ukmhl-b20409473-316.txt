THE ABT OF CONFECTIONARY. 268 of a different kind of currants, black, white, and red ; or the currants may be raised in a quadrangular pjTamid, using in this, case two sorts only, and dishing up the different kinds at cross corners. No. 572.—To Dish up Pine Apples. When dishing up a handsome pine of some four or six pounds weight, it is probable that you may have also some other kind of fruit worthy of the honour of supporting its dignity. On such an occasion, failing a better contrivance, I would advise that the whole of the stalk be left on, to enable you to fix it safely in its necessarily elevated position, by sticking it into a sub- stantial thick cushion-like ring, made of pliant paper, twisted under in the form of a large thick hard bun, and which is known by professors under the name of tampion; the base of the pine should be covered in with dyed moss and vine leaves, real or artificial; and whatever other fruit may be intended to grace the pine, should be raised up round it in artistic groups. Note.—The dyed moss here alluded to is procurable at all fruiterers' in London, and also in most large pro- vincial towns; as are likewise artificial paper leaves. Adams and Son, Haymarket, St. James's, have always on sale an excellent contrivance most useful for dishing up pines and grapes. ITo. 573.—To Dish up Medlars. Trim away all rough asperities with scissors, and dish up the medlars similarly to plums.

THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 378 chocolate ice, smoothed with a knife clipped in cold water, placed in an ice cave; as soon as the cave is filled with the biscuits, let it be entirely buried in rough ice with salt; an hour and a half afterwards they will be ready for table. These biscuits may be dished up with leaf-shaped pieces of green preserved angelica, or placed in small obiong-shaped white paper cases made to their size. ^"0. 791.â€”Iced Biscuits a la Thackeray. Ingredients: 1 pint of syrup of 32 degrees strength, 1 pint of strawberry pulp, 15 yolks of eggs, 1 oz. of vanilla sugar, J pint of double cream whipped. Mix the syrup and yolks, strain, then add the straw- berry pulp and vanilla sugar, set the composition as directed in No. 786 ; incorporate the whipped cream lightly and fill the paper cases (either plaited and cir- cular, or square) ; these must be surrounded each with a band of stiff paper of sufficient width to reach half an inch above the edges of the cases, the bands to be pinched, stuck, or pinned together at one corner, so as to render them secure. The biscuits filled, place them in the ice cave, and imbed this in ice in the usual way. When about to send these biscuits to table, after having first removed the bands of paper, cover their surfaces with brown coloured ratafias bruised to a fine powder and sifted upon them. It will be obvious that the bands of paper to be placed round the cases are intended to give the biscuits the appearance of the composition having risen out of the cases, while the biscuits are supposed to have been baked.

THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 106 The reason macaroons souffles are so liable to spread, is owing to the addition of the royal icing. Note.—Macaroons souffles may also be baked in very small plaited paper cases. Wo. 25L—Italian Macaroons. Prepare the macaroon paste as in No. 249, roll it out in small round balls in your hands, and, as each of these is finished, dip the whole of its surface in w^hite nonpareils, or, as they are familiarly termed white harlequin's eggs, and place the macaroons in rows—at distances from each other upon wafer paper laid out on a baking sheet:—bake in moderate heat. The nonpareils must not lose their whiteness. No. 252.—Ratafias. Ingredients : 8 oz. of Jordan almonds, 4 oz. of bitter almonds, li lb. of fine sugar, four whites of eggs. Scald, skin, wash, and wipe the almonds, and, after they have been dried in the screen, pound them thoroughly, adding the whites of eggs gradually; and then work in the sugar; this will form a firm paste. Fill a macaroon or biscuit forcer with some of the paste, push it out in very small balls—cutting them off to the proper size, and allowing them to drop in rows at distances upon the wafer paper ready placed upon baking sheets to receive them; pass the tip of your finger moistened with water upon their surfaces, push in the oven, at very slack heat, and bake the ratafias of a very light colour,

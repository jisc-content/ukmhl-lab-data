193 FRUIT PASTES AND DROPS, ETC. dried in the usual way, are to be placed in the can- dying pan, as indicated in No. 418, and finished accor- dingly. Fruit pastes intended for candied brochettes, are first to be cut in squares, or stamped out with a shilling-sized tin cutter, rolled in powdered sugar to absorb any moisture on their sides (the sugar to be brushed off), and afterwards are to be stuck through upon straws or splints of wood at proper distances from each other; the brochettes thus rendered com- plete, are to be placed in the candying pans as indi- cated in No. 414 ; the ready boiled sugar when cold is to be poured upon them; and after undergoing the process described in No. 414, they are to be finished in like manner to the dried fruits. No. 416.â€”Rock, or Souffle Sugar. Ingredients: 1|- tb. of loaf sugar, 1 white of egg of stiff white royal icing containing lemon juice, a square case measuring 8 inches by 6 inches, and about 4 inches deep; this case must be made of strong cartridge paper. Boil the sugar tS the crack, then add a good table- spoonful of the icing, stir both together quickly, and allow the souffle to rise in the pan; then stir it again to make it deflect or go down, keep on working the souffle, and as soon as it rises again, pour it into the paper case (having first dredged the bottom and sides of the case with fine sifted sugar), and have ready a nearly red-hot shovel to hold over the souffle for two minutes, as soon as it is poured into the case; this will necessarily caramel, or slightly burn the top part.

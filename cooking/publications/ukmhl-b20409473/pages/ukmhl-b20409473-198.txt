THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 158 No. 354.—Imitation Strawberries. First, push out any given number of large pointed dots, resembling as nearly as possible strawberries ; sprinkle these over with rather coarse granite sugar composed of five parts of deep pink colour, and one sixth part yellow, well mixed :—the leafy stalks of the fruit are to be imitated by using a small cornet, or paper biscuit forcer, to pipe, or push out small circular rows of pointed dots, upon paper, whicn are to be sprinkled over with green granite sugar, No. 193; when both strawberry and leaves are sufficiently dried, let the strawberries be stuck in the centre of the imitation of their leafy stalks. No. 355.—Imitation of Grapes. As you prepare the Italian meringue, No. 349, give it a rose pink blush tint of colour by adding a few drops of prepared cochineal, and use this paste to fill a biscuit forcer with which to form the bunches of grapes by pushing out the meringue paste in drops or pearls of different sizes, so grouped and arranged on the bands of paper as to represent small bunches of grapes: intelligence and practice are of course needed to arrive at any degree of perfection in this as in everything else. Try, and persevere. The leaves and stalks are easily imitated by cutting thin lozenges, or, as they are commonly called, diamonds, of green angelica, and, by placing five of these with the points of one end converging towards the stalk of the bunch of grapes, you will to a certain extent imitate the leaf; stick a thin shred of angelica in at the base of this for the stalk.

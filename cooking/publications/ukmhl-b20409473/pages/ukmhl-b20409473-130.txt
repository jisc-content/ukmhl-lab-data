THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 90 No. 227â€”On Essences for Flavouring. It is very important that all essences used in Con- fectionary should be of the purest kind; and on that account I would recommend that they should be pro- cured at Messrs. Savory and Moore's, New Bond Street, where they are sold of best quality, and in a genuine state. This remark refers also to oil of almonds, rose, and orange flower waters, and generally to all chemicals required by confectioners: such as alum, cream of tartar, carbonate of soda, gums, &c.

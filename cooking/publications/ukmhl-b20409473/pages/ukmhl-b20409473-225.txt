185 ALMOND SOUFFLE ROUT CAKES. First wash the gum, and then put it to soak with a gill of tepid water in a covered gallipot; when the gum has absorbed all the water, it will have become sufficiently soft to admit of its being easily squeezedâ€” or rather, wrung through a strong clean cloth upon a plate : work this gum with your flattened fist on a slab, adding the sugar gradually until the paste becomes stiff enough to enable you to handle it; you now add the two essences, and work in the remainder of the sugar; and, if the quantity named should prove in- sufficient to produce a very stiff paste, add more sugar, as, possibly the gum may have been too much diluted. Keep the Diavolini paste in a covered pot while you are using it. The Diavolini are shaped in the following manner: Take a piece of the paste the size of a walnut, roll it out with your hands, with fine sugar strewn on the slab, so as to form it into a rope about the eighth of an inch thick; divide this with a knife into very small dots, and use fine sugar to aid in rolling them with your finger against the palm of your hand, so as to shape each in the form of a grain of rye or barley. As the Diavolini are turned out of hand, they should be dropped into a clean dry sieve containing half an inch deep of fine dry icing sugar; and when a certain number of Diavolini is completed, move the sieve to and fro to riddle off the sugar, strew them apart from each other over a sheet of paper on a baking- plate, and dry them in the screen : moderate heat. Use up the whole of the paste in this manner, and when the Diavolini are thoroughly dry and cold, keep them in air-tight stoppered bottles.

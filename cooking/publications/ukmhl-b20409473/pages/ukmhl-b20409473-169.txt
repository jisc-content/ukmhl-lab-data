BISCOTTINI AND PATIENCE BISCUITS, ETC. 129 No. 300.—Eussian Biscottini. Ingredients: 8 oz. of flour, i oz. of salt, 1 gill of double cream, 1 oz. of sifted sugar, J oz. of carraway seeds. Mix all the ingredients on the slab into a firm com- pact smooth paste, divide it into about thirty equal parts, roll out these with your fingers on the floured slab, in the form of small sticks, and as you turn each out of hand, spread out the tip of each end on the baking-sheet {not buttered) so as to fasten it down; by this means the biscottini will not twist out of shape while baking; they must be put into a rather sharp heat, and about six minutes will suffice to bake them. These cakes are adapted for the breakfast table, or for handing round with cheese. No. 301.—Hard Cream Biscuits. Ingredients: 8 oz. of flour, 3 whites of eggs, ^ gill of cream, a small glass of brandy, 1 oz. of sugar, a pinch of salt. Work all the ingredients into a compact smooth paste, roll it out very thin, stamp out the biscuits with a round tin cutter of two inches in diameter, prick them all over with a fork, and bake them on a floured sheet, rather sharp heat. These are wine biscuits. No. 302.—Wine Biscuits. Ingredients: 8 oz. of flour, 2 oz. of sugar, 2 oz. of butter, a spoonful of orange sugar, a small glass of malaga wine, a pinch of salt.

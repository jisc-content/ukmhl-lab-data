The greengages may then be drained, dried, and passed through the sugar as in No. 165, drained upon brass wire trays (see Adams' Illustra- tions), and set in the screen to dry for twenty minutes ; afterwards, when cold, to be packed away in boxes with paper. No. 169.—Dried Cherries. Fine large Kentish cherries should be selected for drying. Let the stones be dexterously removed by means of small pointed wooden skewers, made no larger than a quill toothpick, and so handled in the operation of extracting the stone as not at all to tear or damage the fruit.

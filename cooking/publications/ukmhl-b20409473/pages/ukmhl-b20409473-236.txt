THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 196 No. 419.â€”To cast small Ornaments in Grained Sugar. The process is exactly similar to that which has just been described, differing only in the fact that, for this purpose, smaller moulds intended to represent various designs and imitations, such as fruits, eggs, birds, animals, insects, shell-fish, flowers, &c., are to be used instead of larger sizes required in the former cases. When the smaller imitations cast in grained sugar are ready, they are to be painted in colours, so as to imitate nature as nearly as may be. The finish and style, and the degree of perfection to be attained in the production of these very beautiful objects, neces- sarily must depend very much upon the amount of knowledge and experience possessed by the prac- titioner; yet it is to be remembered that an in- domitable determination to succeed, will accomplish wonders.

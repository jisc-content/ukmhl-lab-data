About three or four hours are required to freeze these blocks in warm weather; when a frost prevails, the blocks will readily become frozen by placing the moulds containing the coloured water over night in the open air. When about to turn the blocks out of their moulds, they must be sharply dipped in warm water; and, by immediately setting the several parts forming the vase, &c., in their proper positions, they will instantly become solidly fixed by freezing together.

For greater security in cases where some part of the block will not have sufficient substance to support its own weight, it is positively necessary that a rod of iron should be frozen in the centre of the dolphin stand; for instance, this rod is to u

1)2 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. into a rather soft paste, knead this into the form of a round ball, put it into a stewpan capable of holding three times its quantity, score it all round with a knife, put the lid on and set it to rise in a rather warm place; in the winter it may be put in the screen, but, in hot weather, the fermentation will proceed more satis- factorily, if it is placed on the kitchen table, or in some such place of moderate warmth. This part of the operation is termed setting the sponge. Next, put the remainder of the flour on the slab, and spread it out to form a hollow in the centre ; then put in the salt and the sugar, pour in a little water to dissolve them, add the butter, break in six eggs, and work the whole well together with the hands, until it is well mixed; and then, rubbing the paste with both fists held flat on the slab, move them to and fro so as to reduce any remaining lumps smoothly. By the time that the paste is mixed, the sponge will probably have risen sufficiently; to be perfect, it must have increased three times its original size ; and when spead out on the paste ready to receive it, it should present the appearance of what is called a honey-comb sponge, full of holes, from which it takes its name. Both the above should then be immediately, but gently, and thoroughly mixed. A napkin must be spread in a wooden bowl, or basin, some flour shaken all over the bottom and sides, and the brioche paste lifted into it: sprinkle some flour over the paste, and after throwing the corners of the napkin over all, set the bowl con- taining the paste in a cool place, in the larder, or cellar, free from any current of air, till the next morning.

A lace pattern dessert paper should first be placed on the block when turned out ready to receive the ice; and upon the kind and style of ices, or iced pudding, will very much depend the character of any ftirther decoration which it may be desirable to add.

The mould required to prepare the stand represented in illustration No. 23, may be procured^at Adams and Son's, 57, Haymarket; a pattern may be seen in their illustrated catalogue. When I have used this sort of mould I have found that the upper part upon which the ices have to be placed is insufficient in width; and to remedy this deficiency of space, I contrived an oval piece of very stout pasteboard, round the edge of which I added some fanciful and appropriate droop- ing border, representing sea-weeds, aquatic grass, &c. This imparts a charming eff*ect to the whole.

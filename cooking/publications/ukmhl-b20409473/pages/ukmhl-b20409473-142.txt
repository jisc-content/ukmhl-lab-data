You now fold a sHeet of strong cartridge paper, which must be equally folded in reversed plaits, so that, when the paper is opened, it may present the appearance of angular trenches about an inch deep. Next, fill a biscuit forcer with some of the batter, and push out some finger length biscuits into the aforesaid paper trenches placed on a baking sheet; they must not touch each other; a space of 2 inches should be left between the ends of each biscuit; dredge some sugar over their surface, and bake them of a very light golden brown colour. No. 244.—Orange Biscuits. Prepare the paste as directed in the foregoing number, omitting the carraway seeds, and adding, in their stead, the zest of four oranges rubbed on sugar, and scraped off; push the batter into small round deep moulds previously buttered, sprinkle some small shreds of candied orange peel on their tops, dredge them over with sugar, and bake them in a very moderate heat, of a light colour. No. 245.—Lemon Drops. Prepare the paste as in the foregoing case, using the zest of four lemons instead of the oranges, add the juice of one lemon, and finish with candied lemon instead of orange peel.

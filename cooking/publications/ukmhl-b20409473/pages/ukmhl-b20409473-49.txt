HOW TO BOTTLE FHUITS. I have occasionally purchased them of Mr. Pulleii, in Covent Garden Market; they are of the size of small cherries, and of a beautiful red colour. If you should ever be able to get any quantity of this pretty fruit, I advise you to preserve them for winter use: they are so useful for decoration. The process for preserving these, or other cran- berries, is precisely the same as indicated for red currants, No. 12. No. 20.—To preserve Angelica Green. Cut the tubes, or stalks of angelica into six-inch lengths; wash them clean, and then scald them in water in a copper preserving pan for three minutes, refresh them in cold water, drain upon a sieve, and afterwards proceed in all particulars as directed for green apricots, No. 15. jNfo. 21.—To bottle Apricots whole. It sometimes happens that owing to a high wind, or some other cause, apricots fall before they are quite ripe; on such occasions only is it proper to bottle this fruit whole, and then they are fit for little else but being made into tarts; however, when you wish to preserve any of* them, let them be placed in the bottles, filled up with twenty-two degrees syrup, corked and tied down. Time : twenty minutes' ebullition. No. 22.—To bottle Peeled Halves of Apricots. The fruit for this purpose must be quite ripe,—but not over ripe; split the apricots, and remove the stones

54 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. K"o. 128.—Compote of Currants in bunches. Dip each bunch of currants, holding one end of the stalk, in tepid water, drain them on a sieve, and set them to dry for a few minutes in the screen or hot closet. Whip the white of an egg with a wineglassful of water, and as soon as both are become froth, and incorporated, add a good dessertspoonful of icing sugar, mix and strain through a sieve into a basin. Next, dip each bunch of currants in the egg-water, shake off any superfluous moisture, roll them thoroughly and lightly in some fine powdered sugar previously warmed in the screen for the purpose; and as the bunches are thus sugared over with a semi- transparent coating of icing, place them neatly upon a wire drainer (see Adams' Illustrations), and put them for a few minutes to dry in the screen. When dishing up, arrange the currants in a pyramidal form upon vine-leaves in their compotier. Note.—A number of pretty compotes may be thus prepared; by using for the purpose any kind of small fruits, such as red, black, and white currants, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, plums, &c.; a variety of these for sake of change may form a single compote. No. 129.—Compote of Plums. Pick off the stalks, prick the plums all over with a pin, and let them simmer in syrup a little longer time than for cherries; in all other respects this compote is prepared in the same way.

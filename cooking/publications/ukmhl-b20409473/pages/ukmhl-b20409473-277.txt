Spanish Liquorice Jujubes. Raspberry Jujubes. Black and Red Currant Jujubes, Ordinary Jujubes. No. 504â€”Chocolate Pastilles. Take eight ounces of the finest French chocolate, put it into a sugar pan and place it in the oven (moderate heat) to soften; as soon as you find that on pressing it with the end of your finger it readily yields to the pressure, add half an ounce of gum arable dissolved in a tablespoonful and a half of hot water; stir these together over slow heat until the chocolate becomes perfectly smooth; then add two ounces of fine icing sugar, work this in, and lay out the pastilles by dropping them from the spout of the sugar boiler; as you do so, use a curved piece of wire to cut each pastille off neatly with the wire as it drops upon the sheet of polished tin.

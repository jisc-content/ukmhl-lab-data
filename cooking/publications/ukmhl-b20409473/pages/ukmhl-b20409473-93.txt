COMPOTES IN GENERAL. 53 little apple or orange jelly ; pour over all some syrup flavoured with maraschino. Note.—Previously to cutting out the baskets, the oranges should be turned very thinly and spirally : this part of the process renders the fruit transparent. No. 125.—Compote of Lemon Baskets. Proceed as for orange baskets, using cadrati or citronelle liqueur to flavour the syrup. No. 126.~Compote of Cherries. Fine large cherries are best adapted for making compotes; cut the stalks to within half an inch from the fruit, and when all are so prepared, drop the cherries into some syrup in a sugar boiler, give them a gentle simmer on the fire for three minutes, pour them carefully into a basin, and when dishing up the compote, place the cherries in symmetrical order in the compotier, with their stalks upright, out of the syrup ; add a little syrup flavoured with noyeau. No. 127.—Compote of Currants. Choose the finest fruit, pick the berries from the stalks carefully without bruising or tearing them, and drop them into hot syrup of twenty-two degrees strength, give them a simmer without boiling, pour gently into a basin, and when cold, dish them in their compotier in the form of an elevated cone, and pour the syrup round the base. Note.—Compotes of white and black currants are prepared as the above.

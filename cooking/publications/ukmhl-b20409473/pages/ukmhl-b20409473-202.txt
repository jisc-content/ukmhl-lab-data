THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 162 moulds previously very slightly oiled inside. As each mould is so lined, cut the edges level before the noufifat becomes quite cold, for it is then brittle and breaks.

These nougats form a pretty variety for dessert. No. 364.—Nougat de Marseilles. Ingredients: 8 oz. of honey, 8 oz. of sugar, Ij lb. of scalded and skinned almonds, \ a gill of orange-

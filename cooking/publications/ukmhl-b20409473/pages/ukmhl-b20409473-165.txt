MASSEPAINS AND ALMOND CAKES. 125 cherries^ while down the centre of the remainder you insert a stripe of green angelica; bake them in mode- rate heat. No. 294.—Spanish Macaroons. Ingredients : 8 oz. of Jordan almonds, 1 To. of sugar, 12 yolks of eggs, a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and the rasped rind of two oranges. Boil the sugar to the blow degree, No. 102, then add the pounded almonds and the flavouring, and allow them to simmer very gently together over a slow fire for ten minutes. By a slow fire, I mean a smothered charcoal fire, or some such kind of slow heat incapable of sufficient intensity to burn the composition. At the end of the ten minutes' gentle boiling (stirring occa- sionally) add the yolks of eggs, and stir the paste again over the fire (quicker heat) until it becomes both firm and compact; it must then be removed from the fire, and when cooled is to be rolled in the hands slightly greased with oil of sweet almonds, and laid out upon sheet wafer spread on baking sheets, and baked in rather sharp heat.

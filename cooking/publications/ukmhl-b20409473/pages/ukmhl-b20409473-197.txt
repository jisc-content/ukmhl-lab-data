LONG BISCUITS ICED, AND MERINGUES. 157 over with rather coarse granite sugar No. 189. Tlie underpart, or green leaves, which envelop a cauli- flower, are imitated in a somewhat similar manner to tlie above; by pushing out the paste in pointed dots upon bands of paper, in the manner and form as di- rected for the imitation of the heads, only somewhat flatter; these, in order the better to represent green leaves, are to be sprinkled over with green granite sugar. No. 193, and when both parts have been dried in the closet, or screen, stick the head or white part, upon the leafy, or green part; thus you will form more or less truthful imitation of a cauliflower, according as in a greater or lesser degree you may have displayed your taste. Patience, industry, and perseverance overcome all difficulties. No. 353.—Imitation Mushrooms. Use a biscuit forcer to push out the Italian meringue paste in the forms of small long corks and round drops on stiff paper; slightly sprinkle these over with grated chocolate, and dry them in the closet, or screen; afterwards, stick two of the elongated pieces resem- bling corks together, thus representing the stalks; run the narrowest end of these into the underpart of the drops; and by this means the mushroom will be imitated :—the broad end, or base of the stalk of the mushrooms, should be first dipped in white of egg, and then in grated chocolate, in order the more per- fectly to imitate nature, by adding as a last touch, the imitation of the dark mould which adheres to the stalks.

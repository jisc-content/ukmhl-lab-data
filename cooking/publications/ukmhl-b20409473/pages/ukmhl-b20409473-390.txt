Cinnamon com- fits must receive six or eight coatings of sugar in this way, shaking the pan continuously during the whole time they remain over the fire, and bearing in mind that the comfits must be turned out of the pan upon a baking sheet, to be dried between each charge of syrup given them, the pan being cleaned on each occasion.

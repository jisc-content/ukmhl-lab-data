385 ON FANCY ICES, ICED BOMBS, ETC. after explained, to assist you in composing other fancy- ices which you no doubt will be enabled to imitate without further directions. No. 800.—Imitation Asparagus. To produce this fancy ice you will require at least eighteen asparagus moulds made in pewter, and pro- curable at Adams's, 57, Haymarket; for a pattern, see Adams's Illustrations. Prepare a quart of vanilla cream ice and half a pint of green pistachio ice, or a spoonful of spinach greening mixed with a fourth of the vanilla cream ice will serve the purpose. Use the white ice to mould two-thirds of the asparagus, adding the bud end with the green composition. The asparagus must be imbedded in rough ice for at least an hour, and turned out of their moulds, placed upon paper on the shelves of an ice cave for another hour, in order that they may become frozen perfectly stiff, so as to insure facility in dishing them up. An oval ice block in the shape of a rather low basket or pedestal is best adapted for dishing up imitation asparagus; and to insure a safe maintenance of their position the best way is to dish them in exactly the same manner as natural asparagus. No. 801.—Orang-e Baskets Candied, fiUed with Tuttifrutti Ice. Prepare a dozen orange baskets, No. 124, and just before sending them to table, fill them with tuttifrutti ice, No. 785. Lemon baskets are prepared in the same manner.

383 ON ICED PUDDINGS. sugar; 4 oz. of pine apple cut small, 4 oz. of Sultana raisins, a gill of kirschenwasser, and | pint of double cream whipped. Mix the custard and liqueur, freeze the composition, add the fruit and the whipped cream, and mould the ice. These iced puddings may be further varied by using Nos. 745, 746, 747, and 748 for the purpose. 'Ko, 798.â€”Iced "Water-blocks or Stands, ornamented with Natural Elowers, for dishing up Iced Puddings. I have already treated of this subject in No. 615, and my only object in introducing it again in this place is to add that these very beautiful accessories may be further embellished by using natural flowers for the composition of borders round the edges of the baskets or vases, and also for the ornamentation of the base. To facilitate the appending of the flowers or bouquets to the edges of the vases, &c., it is neces- sary when the coloured water is poured into the mould, that hooks made of wire with a bent top should be hung on to the outside of the vase, having the reversed end bent down an inch long into the water. The water, as it becomes frozen, securely fastens the hooks into the edge of the vase; upon these hooks alternate bouquets of violets and lilies of the valley, mignionette and rosebuds, &c., produce a most charm- ing efl'ect. You will of course have the bouquets ready to hand. For a specimen of this sort of stand, see Illustra- tion No. 29.

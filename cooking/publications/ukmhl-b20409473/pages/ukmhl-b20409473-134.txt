Place the butter in a basin, and work it with a wooden spoon until it assumes the appearance of thick cream, then add the flour and the sugar, and the eggs gradually; when the whole is thoroughly incorporated, add the brandy and salt, mix well to- gether, and bake the paste, either in tin hoops, or else on baking sheets previously greased with butter, or in preference to this, line either the hoops or the baking sheets with buttered paper to prevent the cake from acquiring too much colour. Dried cherries, currants, pistachios, or candied peel, may be added. No. 232.â€”Savoy Biscuits in a Mould. Ingredients: 1 Bb of sifted sugar, fourteen eggs, 4j oz. best flour, 4J oz. of potato flour, or of Brown and Poison's Indian corn flour, a pinch of salt, and any kind of flavouring. ' First, separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, taking care not to drop any portion of the yolks into the whites, as any mixture of these renders it impossible to whisk the whites firm. The yolks must be put into a large white pan, and the whites into a round copper egg bowl, and kept in a cool place until used. Add the sugar and salt to the yolks, also the flavouring, such as vanilla, orange, or lemon zest sugar.

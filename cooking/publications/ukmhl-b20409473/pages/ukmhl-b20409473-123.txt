TRANSPARENT ICING FOR DESSERT CAKES, ETC. 83 maraschino, or kirschenwasser, to flavour the icing, and to bring it to its proper consistency for working; you then take a silver tablespoon, stir the sugar well together, and with the back part of the bowl of the spoon rub and work the sugar up against the sides of the pan; this is intended to give to the sugar an opalised appearance; you then use one of the forks to lift one of the cakes intended to be iced, dip it in the sugar, or else, while holding it upon the fork, use a spoon to pour some of the syrup merely over its surface, and with the other fork lift off the cake upon the paper covering the baking sheet. Proceed to ice over all the other cakes, and when all are completed, push them in the screen, slow heat, to dry them; this will take about ten minutes. No. 205.—Yellow Transparent Icing.

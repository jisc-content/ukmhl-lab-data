No. 623.—Instructions for executing Designs in the forms of Esses, Scrolls, &c., in Caramel. In order to execute any design intended to be made in caramel sugar, it is important that you should first trace out the model with a lead pencil on white paste- board, and afterwards cut it out accurately; this model is then to be placed upon an oiled slab, and its outline is to be traced out thereon with a chalk crayon ; with this correct design for your guide, you will be able to execute in caramel any object you may desire.

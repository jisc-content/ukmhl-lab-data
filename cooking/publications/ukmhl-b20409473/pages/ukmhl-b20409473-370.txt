306 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. Fo.630—On the Introduction of Statuettes as Supporters to Vases, Baskets, 8cc. The Cupids, birds, &c., introduced as supporters in the illustrations contained in this work, are intended to be cast in grained sugar; some of the birds, however, it would be better to form in gum-paste, using moulds for the purpose. In all cases where the statuette is supposed actually to support any apparent weight, it is necessary that a thin rod of iron should run right up the centre of the figure. This rod of iron should be secured at the foot with wax in an upright position in the mould used for casting the figure or statuette. Moulds for similar purposes are com- posed by modellers with dissolved gelatine in the following manner :— Place one or two pounds of common gelatine with water,—at the rate of half a pint to the poimd of gelatine,—in a bain-marie stew-pan, set this in another stew-pan containing hot water, and put both near the stove in order to dissolve the gelatine, and then mix thoroughly. Fasten the Cupid, or any other figure, securely at the base, on the bottom of an appropriate sized bain-marie or pan, then pour the warm dissolved gelatine to it in sufficient quantity to cover in the top of the figure, and place it in the cool to become set stiff. You then dip the pan containing the cast in hot water to turn it out, and as soon as the outside has dried, cut through the gelatine enveloping the figure, so as to divide the gelatine into four equal quarters: this will enable you to remove the figure. You then unite the four quarters together and tie them round securely with string, replace this

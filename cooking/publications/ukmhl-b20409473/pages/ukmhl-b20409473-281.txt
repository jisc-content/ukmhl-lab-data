CHOCOLATE BONBONS AND JUJUBES. 241 No. 515.â€”Ordinary Jujubes. Ingredients : 1 lb. of picked gum arabic soaked in a pint of hot water and afterwards strained, 14 oz. of sugar, J oz. of essence of roses, and a few drops of prepared cochineal. Let the mixture be prepared as directed for other jujubes, but instead of taking the trouble to cast these in impressions made in starch powder, when the preparation is ready, pour it into a very clean smooth tinned baking-sheet to the depth of a quarter of an inch, and set it to dry in the screen, or hot closet (moderate heat); when sufficiently dried, so that on pressing the surface it proves to be somewhat elastic to the touch, remove it from the heat and allow it to become cold; the sheet of jujube may then be easily detached, and is to be cut up with scissors in the shape of diamonds.

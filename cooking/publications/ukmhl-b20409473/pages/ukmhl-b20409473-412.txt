The simplest and easiest method for moulding a bomb-ice is the following:— First set up the mould in a bed of ice for at least half an hour previously to its being filled—the mould thus prepared sets the ice more quickly; commence spreading the ice up—and all over the sides of the mould, in order to fill in any existing cavities formed by the design of the mould, as would be the case when using a pine-apple or melon mould, for instance; when the inside coating is complete, fill the interior with the remainder of the ice, and imbed the mould in plenty of rough ice, and cover a wet cloth over the tub. These directions refer to the moulding of a bomb- ice made of one kind of ice only. Ho. 724.—To Mould a Bomb made of two different sorts of Ices. The mould having been buried in rough ice for half an hour, commence by spreading a thin coating of the fruit-water ice (say a quarter of an inch thick), equally and smoothly over the inside of the mould; and this completed, fill in the interior with the cream ice; close the mould, and imbed it in plenty of rough ice well pounded and mixed with salt.

When it happens that plain moulds are used for this purpose, such as high-dome or flat-topped moulds without any design or cavities, they should be lined

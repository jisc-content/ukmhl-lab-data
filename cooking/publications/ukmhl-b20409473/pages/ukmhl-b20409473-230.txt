This pan should be made of block tin, measuring about fourteen inches by eight inches, and two inches deep ; the sides should be rather on the slant, with a small funnel-like tube in one of the angles or corners of the pan; and if you require several of these pans for making any large quantity of candies, it becomes necessary to have the funnel-shaped tubes placed at different corners, on the right of one pan, and the left corner of the other; so that, when placed upon each other, the excess of sugar may easily drain off.

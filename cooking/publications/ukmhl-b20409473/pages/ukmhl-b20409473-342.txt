284 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. ¥o. 606—A Charlotte a la Parisienne on a Pedestal. Illustration No. 15 represents a Charlotte a la Parisienne. This is composed of a number of pieces of baked pastafrolle, No. 368, cut of equal dimensions in the form of lozenges or diamonds: these are to be iced over, and, when dry, are to be built up in, or rather outside, a plain charlotte mould, the lid or upper part being formed separately: the different pieces required to complete the charlotte are to be stuck together with royal icing: the decoration, in relief and lace pattern, is in royal icing, piped on. The stand is composed of confectioners' paste and gum paste. Ko. 607.—A Chateaubriand on a Pedestal. This consists of six panels of oblong shape, com- posed of pastafrolle-paste baked, and afterwards iced over, either with royal icing, or with transparent icing: the latter is preferable. The six panels must be cut of equal dimensions, for otherwise they would not fit in correctly with each other, so as to form a perfect hexagon, that is, a figure of six angles and sides. The whole of the decoration consists of royal icing, piped on; the six panels are to be decorated before building up the Chateaubriand, and the borders and fringe piped on afterwards. Illustration No. 16 is placed here for your guidance. The pedestal in this case also is made of confec- tioners* paste.

260 THE ABT OF CONFECTIONARY. Put the fruit into a large earthen pan, pour the water with the tartaric acid dissolved in it over the fruit, cover the pan with some kind of lid, and allow the whole to steep for twenty-four hours in a cold place; and if possible, it would be all the safer if the pan containing the fruit could be immersed in rough ice. Next, pour the steeped fruit into a suspended stout flannel bag; and when all the juice has run through, tie up the open end of the bag, and place it on a large earthen dish, with another dish upon it, place a half-hundred weight upon this to press out all the remaining juice, and then mix it with the other juice. You now put the sifted sugar into the juice, and stir both together occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, and then bottle off the syrup; cork and tie down the bottles with wire, and keep them in the ice well, or in a cold cellar, in a reclining position. All juices of fruits may be prepared in the same manner. This is the best method for preserving fruit syrups with their full natural flavour.

CREAM ICES IN GENERAL. S6b When about to freeze the Plombieres, put the com- position into the freezer, twirl it about with quick motion, and occasionally work the ice with the spatula; as soon as it has become set or has frozen pretty stiff, work in the meringue, and when thoroughly incor- porated, mix in the whipped cream, and set up or mould the Plombieres. Plombieres cream ice is not always set up in a mould; it is sometimes piled up in rock-like fashion, with apricot jam between the layers, and garnished round the base with some kind of almond cakes. A lace pattern dessert paper, placed upon a folded napkin on a dish or ice stand, is generally used for this pur- pose. All other ices may be served in the same fashion. ITo. 736.-Walnut Cream Ice. Ingredients: 3 gills of milk, 12 oz. of the kernels of fresh walnuts, just as they begin to ripen; at a later period walnuts do not answer the purpose so well; the kernels are to be well pounded with a tablespoonful of orange-flower water and a little of the milk, and after- wards mixed with the remainder of the milk, and rubbed through a hair sieve into a basin; 12 oz. of sifted sugar, a pint of double cream whipped, and 2 whites of Italian meringue. Mix the walnut kernel milky pulp with the sugar in the freezer, freeze and work the ice well until it has become stiff; then add the meringue by degrees, and as soon as this is incorporated, mix in the whipped cream lightly, yet thoroughly; and set up the ice in its mould in the usual way.

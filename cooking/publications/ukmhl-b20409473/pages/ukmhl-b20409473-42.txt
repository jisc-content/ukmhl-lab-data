THE ART OF CONFECTIONAPvY. 2 13*0. 2—The safest Method for corking Preserves. Soak the corks in tepid water containing a little sugar^ and use Adams & Son's corking machine [see illus- trations*] to press and force the corks into the bottles. No. 3—How to tie down the Corks. Twirl one end of a piece of string so as to form a circular loop measuring about two and a-half inches in diameter; then raise the string in your right hand —inside the loop—so as to represent the handle of a basket; place this contrivance immediately over the neck of the bottle, with the raised part of the string resting close upon the top of the cork, pull the two ends of the string tightly, raise up the ends, and fasten them together securely with a double-knot: let this be repeated crosswise. No. 4.—Tying down with Wire. It is necessary to wear strong gloves to prevent the wire from cutting your hands. Use pincers to fasten the ends, for the purpose of twisting them securely instead of tying them as directed when using string. A circular piece of tin must be placed upon the top of the corked bottle to prevent the wire from cutting through the corks—an accident which woMld be sure to happen unless this precaution were used. The principal advantage of using wire instead of string for corking down preserves consists in its neatness. * Adams & Son's Illustrated Catalogue is here and in other parts of this work, for the sake of brevity, thus referred to.

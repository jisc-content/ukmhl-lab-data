IMITATION OF FRUITS IN ALMOND PASTE, ETC. 243 sugar, No. 418, or almond paste, No. 225, being used for these purposes, according to directions given in No. 419 and following. No. 517.—On Colouring of Imitation Emits. The object intended to be coloured, such as an imitation peach, for instance, must be perfectly dry, and the process of laying on the colours is to be conducted in the manner following:— Grind gamboge and cobalt-blue with water on a plate in such relative proportions as will produce a yellowish green tint; this colour must be rather watery, and is be painted all over the peach with a camel-hair brush, sparingly and equally, and allowed to become perfectly dry before giving it another coat. The main body colour to be produced is a faintly greenish yellow, which, to have a good effect, should be laid on in three different coatings; the rosy ripeness of the peach is to be imparted by using a short-haired paste brush, with the hairs tied close round to within half an inch of the tip; lightly dip this in prepared oarmine, lay the colour on one side, or partly over the natural division of the peach, and use a dry soft brush to spread the colour off to an imperceptible shade ; when this is dried, give a delicate coating with thin gum, and before the gum has become quite dry, use some starch powder tied up in a small muslin bag, to be shaken lightly and sparingly over the peach, to imitate the velvety bloom natural to the fruit.

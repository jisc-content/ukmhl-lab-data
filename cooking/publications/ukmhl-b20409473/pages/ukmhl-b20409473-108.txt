THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 68 until it oecomes dulled or whitish ; then throw in the dried halves of apricots, shake all round gently together, and use a silver fork to lift out the pieces of apricots, placing them with the outer side uppermost upon the brass drainer as before, and set them in the screen again to dry the sugar for about an hour: when finished, put them away in boxes with a sheet of clean paper in between each layer of dried apricots. No. 166—Dried Peaches. Prepare the peaches in the first instance as indicated for compotes No. 136, but with more syrup; boil up the syrup three days running, adding it boiling to the fruit in its basin each time. The halves of peaches are afterwards to be drained, dried upon the brass drainers in the screen, ver}^ lightly painted over with a camel-hair brush dipped in prepared cochineal or carmine, and when the colour is perfectly dried on the peaches, finish them in the same manner as indicated for apricots. No. 167.—Dried Plums. The larger kind, egg-plums, golden-drops, magnum-" bonums, &c., are best suited for the purpose. Divide the plums in halves, or leave them whole, according to fancy; let them simmer very gently in twenty-four degrees syrup for about five minutes, and pour them gently into a white pan to steep in their syrup until the next day; the syrn-p only must then be boiled up, skimmed, and poured back on the plums, and covered over.

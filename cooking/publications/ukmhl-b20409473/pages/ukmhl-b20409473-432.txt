THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 868 ance with the required strength, marks 24 degrees. In the event of the composition being too thin, too poor in sugar, the saccharometer would mark below the 24 degrees; and this will be rectified by adding a little more syrup to bring the composition to the right point. If too rich in sugar, it will then mark a higher number than 24; add a little water to esta- blish the correct proportions, by reducing it to 24 degrees. For setting up the freezer, and freezing and finishing the ice, see No. 716. No. 768.—White Currant Water Ice. Ingredients: Ij pint of white currant juice, (flavoured by adding a third of white raspberries if procurable,) 1 pint of strong syrup, 2 whites of Italian meringue, No. 349. Mix the juice and the syrup, freeze the composition stiff, then add the Italian meringue by degrees; work altogether vigorously, and when thoroughly incor- porated, and the ice has become frozen sufficiently firm, let it be set up in its mould, and imbedded in rough ice, until it is required to be turned out of its mould, previously to sending it immediately to table.

ON DESSERT CAKES IN GENERAL. 95 or a few drops of any kind of essence; work all well together for twenty minutes, until the batter becomes a creamy substance. The whites must now be whisked into a smooth firm snowy froth, and when ready, mix them in. very lightly with the batter, adding the two flours gradually at the same time. The batter thus prepared must be poured in a mould previously prepared in the following manner:â€” Chop finely eight ounces of beef or veal suet, and melt this down in a small stewpan over a slow fire, then strain it through a sieve, pour it into the cake mould, turn the mould round in all directions that the inside may be equally greased in every part; then drain out all superfluous grease, shake out any remain- ing drops, throw in a pound of the finest sifted icing sugar, shake this round inside the mould, so as to thoroughly line it with a thin coating or covering of the sugar. When the cake is ready for the oven, stick a broad band of stiff paper equally round the upper edge of the mould to prevent the batter from running over as it rises, twist a thick cording of paper into a circular shape to be placed round the bottom part of the mould, this to be placed resting upon a thin heap of wood-ashes on its baking sheet; push in the oven, moderate heat: particular care must be taken to keep the oven door closed as much as possible while the cake is baking, and also not to increase its heat after- wards ; this may be easily avoided by heating the oven to a suf&cient temperature in the first instance. It is almost impossible to determine the exact length of time, that this, or indeed, any other cake

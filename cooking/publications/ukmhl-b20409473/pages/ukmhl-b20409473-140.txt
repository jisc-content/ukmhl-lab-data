THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 100 buds and flowers, and wreaths of artificial orange flower blossoms, to be intermixed with the other mode of decoration. The whole of the ornamentation of a wedding cake must be white, with the exception of a wreath of blush roses. {See Frontispiece.) No. 239.—Ginger Cakes. Ingredients : 1 lb. of flour, 12 oz. of butter, 12 oz. of sifted sugar, 2 oz. of ground ginger, eight yolks of eggs. Work the whole of the above-named ingredients with the hands on a pastry-board, or slab, and having gathered the paste up into a compact mass, separate it into four parts; roll these out with flour to the thick- ness of the sixth part of an inch, one after another, and with a tin cutter —either oval, round, or any other shape, stamp out as many cakes as the paste will produce, and place them in order upon a slightly but- tered baking sheet; push in the oven, pass a paste brush dipped in white of egg over them when about half done, dredge some sugar over their surface, and finish baking the cakes of a light colour. No. 240.—Ginger Drops. Prepare the paste as in the foregoing case, adding two whites of eggs; use this to fill a biscuit forcer, and push out the drops the size of a small walnut on a buttered baking sheet—at the distance of one inch and a half from each other; strew small shreds of candied peel on their tops, and bake them of a light colour.

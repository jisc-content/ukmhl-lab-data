PRESERVED FRUITS IN BRANDY. 209 No.439—Pears in Brandy. Divide the pears in halves or quarters, and as they are turned out of hand drop them into some acidulated water, to prevent them from becoming brown; then let the pieces of pear simmer in syrup till half done through, and finish them as directed for peaches. Ho. 440.—Cherries in Brandy. Morello cherries are fittest for this purpose; cut the stalks off to within half-an-inch of the fruit, and as you do so, drop each cherry into a glass jar; when the jars are all complete and ready to receive the liquid, mix equal proportions of twenty-eight degrees' syrup, cold, and brandy, and pour this to the cherries: cork them down tight, tie them over with bladder, and keep the jars in a cool temperature.

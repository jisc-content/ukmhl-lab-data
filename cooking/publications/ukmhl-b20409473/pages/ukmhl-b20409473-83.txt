COMPOTES IN GENERAL, called the thread: this is to be ascertained by dipping the tip of the index or forefinger of the right hand, first into iced water, then into the boiling sugar, and instantly back again into the iced water to prevent burning your finger; but, as the sugar in this state would quickly run off your finger, and melt away before you had time to ascertain its degree, you must quicldy withdraw it from the water; then pinch the sugar between the index and thumb, and on slightly distending them apart, you will find a thread is formed, which prompth^ snaps before it has reached to but a short length; it is then called the small thread; when,^ after a few more ebullitions, it admits of the thread being extended to greater length, it has arrived at the large thread degree. No. 101â€”Second degree, or Pearl. The sugar, having boiled a few moments longer, must now be tried as in the former case, between the fingers, when, if you find that on drawing it out to a thread it snaps quickly, and also that, while boiliiig,^ the sugar presents the forms of large pearls or globules on its surface^ it will then have reached the small X^earl degree; and w^hen the pearls become closer connected on the surface of the sugar, it has then arrived at the large pearl degree.

55 COMPOTES IN GENERAL. Note.—All compotes of plums are to be made in the same manner. ^0.130.—Compote of Apricots. Split the fruit in halves, peel them thinly and smoothly, let them simmer in thin syrup for a few minutes, add the kernels, and dish them up in a pyramidal form, with their syrup over the compote. No. 131.—Compote of G-reengages. Pick off the stalks, prick them all over, let them simmer in syrup, and serve as above. For appearance sake, the greengages may be coloured green, as directed in No. 15. No. 132.—Compote of Pomegranates. With the point of a small knife cut out a circle the size of a five-shilling piece off the peel of the pome- granates, then split down the sides of their skins, and carefully remove the bright ruby i^ips, without bruising them, into the compotier; pour some syrup flavoured with orange juice or maraschino over the compote.

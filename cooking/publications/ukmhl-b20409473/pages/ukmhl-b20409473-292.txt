252 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. N"o. 540—Beignets of Fruit Paste a la Eeine. Prepare thin layers of any kind of fruit paste de- scribed in this work, stamp out circular pieces the size of a florin, and between two of these insert another similar sized piece of some kind of stiff jelly, such as apple or currant jelly; when a given number are completed, finish the beignets as directed for angelica lozenges glaces, No. 593. Uo. 541—Beignets of Pine Apple. These consist of thin slices of preserved pine apple, stamped out with a circular tin cutter: to form the beignet it is necessary to stick two of them together with pine apple jam between; they must afterwards be pounced over with sifted sugar, and dried upon wire trays in the screen, and are then to be dipped in half- grained sugar^, and again placed in very moderate heat to dry. Note.—These beignets may be still further varied by using for their preparation any of the different kinds of fruit pastes described in this work; bear in mind that the jelly introduced between the two circular pieces of fruit paste should be of a diff'erent colour to the paste.

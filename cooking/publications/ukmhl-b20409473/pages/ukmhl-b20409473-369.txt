IMITATION HAMS, WEDDING CAKES, ETC. 805 lined with either kind of paste rolled out very thin and gently pressed into the mouldings or sunk portions of the moulds, so that when the objects moulded are delivered they may turn out perfect. All kinds of moulds as well as most elegantly devised patterns of gum-paste border-moulds, and indeed every requisite imaginable for the use of an artist of our profession, are always procurable at Adams and Son's, Haymarket, St. James's. It is of the last importance that the different pieces composing the whole edifice, whether this consists of what is generally called a piece montee (a term generally supposed to mean some representation of architecture in the form of a temple, pavilion, kiosk, fountain, castle, ruin, &c.), or of baskets, vases, stands, &c., should be thoroughly dried before they are stuck together, for otherwise the ornament would be liable to give way and fall to pieces. Almond and gum paste being usually coloured for these purposes, it is useless to colour them afterwards as in former cases. When the body of the ornament is coloured, the borders or other decorations should be white; when it happens that the vase, &c., is white, the ornamentation should be coloured either brown, pink, blue, or green : in no case use more than three colours; indeed, it is admitted as a rule, that two colours only constitute the best taste. In some instances the whole ornament may be wrought in pure white; but this course requires the greatest precision and correctness in the execution of the whole work, as the absence of colour tends to expose defects more distinctly to the eye.

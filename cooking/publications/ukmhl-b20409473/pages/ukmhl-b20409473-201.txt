161 CHAPTER XVI. ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOUGAT, PASTAFROLLE AND Ingredients: 1 lb. of shred almonds dried, No. 129, and 10 oz. of sifted sugar. First put the almonds on a baking plate just at the entrance of the open oven to make them hot through, and while the almonds are being heated, place the sugar in a copper egg-bowl, and keep moving it about with a clean wooden spoon over a moderate stove fire until it begins to melt; you then quicken the motion of the hand, and, as soon as you perceive that the sugar begins to pearl up on the surface in the form of small white bubbles, immediately throw in the almonds, stir all together gently until well mixed, and then proceed to use the nougat to line thinly small deep fancy-shaped CHESTNUT BISCUITS.

IMITATION OF FBUITS IN ALMOND PASTE, ETC. 251 with sifted sugar, and place them out of hand upon wire trays in the screen to dry. No. 538.—Imitation Walnuts. Ingredients: 1 Bb. of sugar, 8 oz. of cleaned kernels of fresh walnuts, pounded with a gill of maraschino into a smooth pulp. Boil the sugar to the crack degree, No. 105, and incorporate the pounded walnuts therewith, use half the paste to cast impressions of the one half of the kernel of a walnut—in hollows imprinted in starch powder as directed for other honbons: use the remainder of the paste to cast impressions in imitation of one shell of a walnut, in like manner to that in- dicated for the formation of the kernels. When both parts of the walnuts are dried, stick them together with gum paste, or thick diluted gum, so as to repre- sent a walnut with the upper part of its kernel bared; paint the shell with burnt umber colour, and use thin royal icing to give a light coating to the exposed kernel. E'o. 539.—Angelica Glace, with different kinds of Jelly. Select a few broad hollow stalks, or reeds of green preserved angelica, cut them in rather large lozenge or diamond shapes, fill up the hollows with stiff apple or currant jelly, or any other stiff preserve; dip these in half-grained sugar, and place them out of hand upon wire trays in the screen to dry.

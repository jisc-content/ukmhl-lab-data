108 ON DESSERT CAKES IN GENERAL. No. 246â€”Brussels Biscottes. Ingredients : 1 fb. of flour, 10 oz. of butter, 4 oz. of sifted sugar, ^ oz. German yeast, the zest, of two lemons, a pinch of salt, a gill of double cream. Prepare this paste as directed for brioche paste No. 228, and when it has proved, or risen satisfactorily, put it in a pan, add the cream, and when thoroughly incorporated, beat up the paste with the hand until it becomes elastic. Divide the pound of paste into about twelve equal parts, roll these out with flour on the slab, about three inches in length, and put each into oblong shaped tin pans previously buttered to receive them; set them on a baking sheet to rise in a com- paratively warm atmosphere, and as soon as risen, egg them over, push in the oven, rather better than moderate heat, and bake them of a bright golden colour. When baked and cold, cut the cakes in slices lengthwise, spread out the slices on clean baking sheets, and colour them slightly in the oven. If you have no moulds or tins appropriated to this purpose, the rolls may be at once placed in rows on a buttered baking sheet, and when risen, baked. No. 247.~Plain Rusks. Ingredients: 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of yeast, half a pint of double cream, a teaspoonful of salt, 6 eggs. Proceed as for brioche paste. No. 228, adding the cream when the paste has risen twice, work both vigorously in a pan, divide it in four equal parts^

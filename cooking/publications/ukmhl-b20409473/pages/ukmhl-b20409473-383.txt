ESSENCES FOR MAKING LIQUEURS, ETC. 319 First rub the almonds in a clean cloth, and then riddle them in a coarse sieve, to clear them free from all dust and fragments. Put the clarified s^Tup in a small egg-bowl to boil on a stove fire, and as soon as it has boiled to the pearl degree throw in the ahnonds and the essence, and with a wooden spoon gently stir all together; at each stroke of the spoon lift the almonds from the bottom of the pan, turning them over and over as you do so in order to envelop, or, as we term it, to charge the almonds with a coating of sugar. To perform this part of the operation with all security, and to prevent the sugar from burning, as soon as the almonds begin to crack, or rather to emit a cracking noise, the pan should be immediately removed from off the fire ; and as by the act of stirring the almonds in the sugar the latter becomes grained almost like sand, as soon as it presents this appearance cease stirring the almonds, and empty them out on a dry baking sheet to cool. You now pick out the charged almonds, and put the sandy-grained sugar remaining behind, again into the sugar boiler with another half pint of thirty-two degrees syrup ; boil both together, adding a few drops of carmine or cochineal, and when the sugar is boiled to the small crack, again gently cast in the burnt almonds, stirring them gently to give them another coating or charge of sugar. The burnt almonds must receive one or two more charges conducted in the same fashion: this will end the process. If the pralines present an uneven rocky surface, are of a light pinky tinge, and perfectly hard and crisp when bitten asunder, they will be perfect.

THE AET OF CONFECTIONAEY. CHAPTER I. ON PRESEKYmG FRUITS m BOTTLES. No. 1.—Preliminary Eemarks on preserving Fruits in Bottles. To arrive at perfection in the art of preserving fruits in bottles, it is important that strict attention be paid to the following instructions—viz.: First, in all cases the fruit should be morning-gathered and not over ripe; secondly, the bottles must be so made as to present an equal thickness of substance through- out their shape, and, moreover, they must be entirely free from any crack or flaw, and perfectly clean and dry; thirdly, the corks used for stopping the bottles must be cut to fit tightly, so as to be forced into the necks of the bottles, and they must be cut from the soundest material, perfectly free from decay, and, in fact, as faultless as may be. Corks, or bungs, pro- duced from the material used for cutting claret corks, are the best for our purpose.

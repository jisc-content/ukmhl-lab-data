THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 62 K"o, 157—Compote of Tangerine Oranges. These may be prepared in every variety of form prescribed for ordinary oranges. Ho. 158.—Compote of Cocoa Nut, white. Saw the shell of the cocoa nut and divide it in quarters, peel off the brown skin, and soak the clean pieces in cold water with lemon juice and a little salt; first cut these in thin slices and afterwards in thick thread-like shreds resembling vegetables cut for julienne soup; as these are shred in small quantities out of hand, let them be dropped into a basin of cold water with lemon juice and a little salt, and allow the shreds to soak in this for an hour. At the end of this time the prepared shreds are to be drained on a clean sieve, washed in another water to free them entirely from the oil which exudes, and drained again on the sieve. Boil one pound of the finest loaf sugar to the blow, remove it from the fire, throw in the prepared cocoa nut, give all a boil up on the fire, stirring lightly with a silver fork, and then lift out the shreds with the fork well drained from the sugar and place them on a sieve; boil up the sugar, throw in the cocoa, give it another boil on the fire, and drain it again ; add a few drops of lemon juice to the sugar, boil it to the pearl, throw in the cocoa, move it lightly, and lastly drain it on a sieve; separate the shreds carefully with two silver forks, one held in each hand, and when cold dish up the cocoa in an elevated pile in its compotier; pour round the base some clear syrup flavoured with cedrati Uqueur.

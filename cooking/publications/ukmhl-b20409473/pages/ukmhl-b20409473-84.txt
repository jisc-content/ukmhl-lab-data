44 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. sugar is right, it will form itself into small globules on the other side; this will indicate the degree called the blow. No. 103.—Fourth degree, or the Feather Boil up the sugar a little longer, dip the skimmer in it, shake it, and, on finding that it shivers into a sort of thready fringe from the edge, it will then have reached the degree called the feather. No. 104.—Fifth degree, or the Ball. In a few moments' more boiling, the sugar will be at the ball degree ; in this state, if a little is dropped into cold water, and immediately rolled between the index and thumb, it will readily be formed into a soft ball. No. 105.—Sixth degree, the Crack, or Snape Give the sugar a few more ebullitions, dip the finger in cold water, then in the sugar, quickly back into the water, and then if you find that the distended piece of boiled sugar instantly snaps asunder, and is hard and dry, it has arrived at the degree called the crack. No. 106.—Seventh degree, or Caramel. As soon as the sugar begins to gain more or less colour, it is said to have become caramelled, or hard baked; this degree is perceptible from its strong acrid odour or smell, as well as from its assuming a light brown colour; any degree of baking beyond this.

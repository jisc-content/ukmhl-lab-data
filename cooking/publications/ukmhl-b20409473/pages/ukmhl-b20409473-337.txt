ORNAMENTAL CARAMEL BASKETS, ETC. 281 Tlie croque-en-houche is also to be placed on an ornamental pedestal. Ho. 599.—A Swan made of Nougat. For this purpose it will be necessary that you should possess a mould representing a gracefully designed swan, and use it to form a shell of that pattern with nougat prepared as in No. 362; leaving a circular hole on the back sufficiently large to admit of its being easily filled with some kind of ice, before sending it to table. The bill, eyes, and feet, are to be imitated with royal icing resembling their proper colours. The feathers, as represented in illustration No. 8, are to be piped on with double cream whipped without any sugar, adding instead an ounce of finely powdered gum arabic: this keeps the cream stiff. The waves are formed of spun sugar, and the imitation fruits consist of transparent glaces, for making which see No. 260, and following. Ho. 600.—A lyre formed of Gum Paste and Spun Sugar. To accomplish this, it is necessary that you should procure a proper mould adapted to the purpose : this is procurable at Adams's, 57, Haymarket, St. James's. Gum paste. No. 831, is required for the moulding and formation of this graceful ornament: the strings and other portions of the decorations are to be formed of caramel sugar, and of royal icing, piped on in imitation of the designs represented in illustration No. 9. For the preparation of the flowers, see No. 631.

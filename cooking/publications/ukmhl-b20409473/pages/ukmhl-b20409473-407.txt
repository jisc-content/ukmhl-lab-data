ON ENGRAVED BOARDS FOR GUM PASTE, ETC. 343 "No. 709.—The Freezing Bench. A low table or bench upon which to rest the freezing- tubs, is a most useful thing when freezing ices, as from its moderate elevation you are enabled to have full power over your actions while freezing. Ho. 710.—Boards to stand upon while Freezing. To protect your assistants from taking cold by standing in a pool of cold water while attending to ice freezing, I would recommend that you should always be provided with some boards to keep their feet dry. ^0, 711.—Ice Shovel. This may be made either of iron or copper; it should be somewhat in the form of a large scoop; a larger kind of shovel is also necessary, the more effectually to deal with large quantities of rough ice. No, 712.—An Ice Dibble. This is a rather thick wooden roller, measuring about two feet in length, and obtusely pointed with an iron ferule at one end; it is useful for the purpose of breaking any awkward pieces of ice which may have been inadvertently put round the freezer, and also to procure ventilation by thrusting it down a mass of ice m order to let off the water more quickly.

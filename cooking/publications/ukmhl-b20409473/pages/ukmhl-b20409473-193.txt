LONG BISCUITS ICED, AND MERINGUES. 153 begins to dissolve on their surface, push them in the oven, very moderate heat, and bake them of a very light fawn colour. When the meringues are done, remove each piece separately and carefully off the paper; use a dessert- spoon to scoop out the white soft part, and with the point of the bowl of the spoon smooth the inside of the meringues; after this they are to be placed with the rounded side downwards upon baking sheets to dry the insides in the oven, and when thoroughly crisp, are to be kept between sheets of paper in a tin box in a very dry place. When using the meringues for dessert or otherwise, garnish them with whipped cream flavoured with vanilla, orange, lemon, or any other flavoured sugar, with orange-flower water, or any kind of liqueur, sticking two halves together after they are so garnished. These meringues may also be slightly garnished with any kind of preserve previously to adding the whipped cream. No. 347.â€”Cream Iced Meringues. For this purpose the meringues should be made smaller, about the size of a pigeon's egg; they are to be filled very neatly with stiff whipped cream, taking care that when the two halves are closed together none of the cream is allowed to ooze over the edges; or, if it should do so, wipe it off; when the meringues are ready crammed, hold each separately on a silver fork to dip them all over in transparent icing, using for the purpose any of those described at No. 204 and following numbers.

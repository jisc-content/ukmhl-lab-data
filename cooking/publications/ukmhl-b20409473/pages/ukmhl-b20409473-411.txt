ON ENGRAVED BOARDS FOR GDM PASTE, ETC. 847 also circular ice-caves of smaller dimensions, used for freezing iced souffles, or a small number of iced biscuits. (See Adams' Illustrations.) Ko. 721.—Ice-Bamb Moulds. These moulds are made in several pieces, and are fastened together with brass pins; they are of different forms and shapes, some being conical, while others are spherical; the latter being round like a bomb-shell, are most appropriate as far as their shape goes; but the fact is that bomb-ices may be, and are made, or rather moulded, in a variety of differently shaped moulds bearing no resemblance to a bomb-shell. The par- ticular composition which chiefly characterises this kind of ice consists in its being exteriorly coated with one kind of coloured ice, while the interior is filled with a different sort and colour; for instance the rind or outer shell of the bomb should be formed with a thin coating of cherry-water ice, while the interior should consist of a vanilla cream ice. No. 722.—Bricked-shaped Ices for cutting up. For this purpose a mould of the size and form of an ordinary brick and made in copper or tin is required; the different kinds of ices, whether composed of fruit or liqueur-water ices, or of cream ices, are used for filling the moulds, which, after being frozen, are cut up in slices previously to being handed round; a knife dipped in hot water is used to cut up the ices; they are best adapted for evening parties, concerts, routs, balls, &c.

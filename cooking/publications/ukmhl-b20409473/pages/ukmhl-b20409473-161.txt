MASSEPAINS AND ALMOND CAKES. 121 size of a walnut, upon sheet-wafer spread on baking plates. The cracklings should be placed one inch and a half apart from each other, slightly spread out with the tip of the finger dipped in water, and kept to a circular form, and a quarter of an inch in thickness: bake them in moderate heat, and of a light colour. No. 285—Pistachio Cracklings. Ingredients: 6 oz. of shred pistachios, 4 oz. of pounded pistachios, 10 oz. of sifted sugar, 2 whites of eggs, a tablespoonful of vanilla sugar. Thoroughly mix all the ingredients together in a basin, and afterwards lay out the cracklings as directed in the preceding number. These cracklings must be baked in slack or slow heat, on account of the colour of the pistachios, which is apt to turn yellowish if exposed to great heat. No. 286.-Filbert Cracklings. The same proportions as for almond cracklings, using filbert kernels instead of almonds for the pur- pose ; flavour with noyeau. No. 287.—Rheims Biscuits. Ingredients: 15 oz. of sugar, 6 oz. of flour, 12 whites of eggs, 10 yolks, a pinch of salt. Place the eggs and the sugar and salt in a copper egg-bowl, and whisk them with the bottom part of the bowl resting upon a trivet placed above a smothered charcoal stove fire, and continue briskly whisking

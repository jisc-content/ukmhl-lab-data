Place the bottles to be iced in a tub about four inches apart from each other, fill them with spring water within one and a half inches of the neck; twist a covering of paper tightly over the tops, and then surround the water-bottles with rough ice pounded and mixed with salt at the rate of one pound of salt to eight pounds of ice; be careful not to allow the ice to reach more than three parts up the sides of the bottles, for when too powerfully charged with ice and salt, from the congealing force given to ice by the addition of salt or saltpetre, the bottles are liable to break. When about to place the iced water bottles on table, if the water inside should be frozen in a solid mass, just place them in cold water for three minutes : this will cause a portion of it to dissolve, and produce a sufficient quantity for immediate necessity. An hour and a half will prove time enough to freeze a bottle of water. No. 686.â€”Instructions for the preparation of Iced Beverages, called Graniti.

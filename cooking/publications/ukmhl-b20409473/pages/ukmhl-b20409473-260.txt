The sugar having become cold, you then use a clean wooden spoon to work it vigorously, commencing by detaching it from the sides of the pan with the spoon, and working it up from the bottom, until it becomes soft and flexible. At first, this part of the operation will be found rather tedious; but, as the sugar greases, or slightly grains, it will become easier to work. When the sugar has rested some little time, take small portions of it in a spouted sugar boiler, to be warmed over the fire, stirring gently the while with a spoon, carefully avoiding to heat it too much, and allowing it to attain only a medium degree of heat; for when the sugar is too much heated, it destroys all delicacy: at the same tune, be it re- membered, that it is better to err on the safe side, that is, better to have the sugar over than under baked.

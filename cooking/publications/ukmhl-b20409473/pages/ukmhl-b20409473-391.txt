COMFITS, NONPAREILS, ETC. 827 No. 671â€”Nonpareils. Procure two ounces of orris root powder and half an ounce of fine powdered gum arabic, and use just enough very thick syrup to mix them in a pan over slow heat into a very stiff paste ; divide this into infi- nitesimal quantities, and with fine sugar roll them in a leather drum (this resembles a sieve), and set them on paper to be dried in the screen. For coating or charging nonpareils with sugar proceed as for carraway seeds; they may be coloured by adding a pinch of car- mine while giving the last two charges. Any other colour is considered in bad taste.

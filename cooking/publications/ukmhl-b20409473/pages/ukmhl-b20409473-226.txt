THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 186 Note.—These comfits are very expensive to buy, and are moreover very seldom to be met with in any of the confectioners' shops in England.—I have placed them here on account of their being required to com- plete the following recipe. No. 404.—Small Souffles with Candied Peels. Ingredients : 4 whites of eggs, 12 oz. of sifted sugar, 1 oz. of Diavolini, and 2 oz. of finely shred candied peels. Whisk the whites stiff, then incorporate the sugar, Diavolini, and peels ; nearly fill the small paper cases, and bake the souffles in slow heat, of a very light colour. No. 405.-Zephyr Souffles. Ingredients : 8 oz. of fine sifted sugar, 8 oz. of finely shred almonds, 2 whites of eggs, and a few drops of essence of peppermint. Put the whites of eggs and the sugar in an untinned copper sugar boiler, and whisk them over a very slow smothered charcoal stove fire, into a substantial white frothy icing; you then add the almonds, and about three drops of the essence, and gently mix the whole with a dessert-spoon ; then lay out the zephyrs in the manner following:— Spread some sheets of white wafer upon baking- plates, and use a dessert-spoon to- lay out the zephyrs in lumps the size of a rather large walnut, one inch and a half apart from each other; bake them in slow heat, of very light colour.

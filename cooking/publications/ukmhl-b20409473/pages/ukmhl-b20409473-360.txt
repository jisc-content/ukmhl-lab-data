296 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. No. 621—To boil Sug^ar for Spinning As the quantity to be boiled, must necessarily depend upon your present requirement, it becomes useless to name any decided weight of sugar; although, it must be admitted that it is far better to boil sugar in com- paratively large quantities, (three or four pounds,) than in very small quantities, (eight or sixteen ounces,) from the fact that, in the latter case, the sugar passes so rapidly from one degree to another, that nothing short of the strictest and most minute attention, will enable you to boil eight ounces of sugar to any given degree, in a perfectly satisfactory manner. The sugar boiler should be of upright shape, and of moderate thickness; a thin worn out sugar boiler, is worse than useless, for, in attempting to use it, waste is certain to be the only result. The upper part or pointed end being the purest part of a loaf of sugar, keep this in reserve for boiling; break up the sugar into small lumps, and put it in the sugar boiler with just as much cold water as will thoroughly saturate it, and allow it to become dissolved; then add a pinch of cream of tartar, and set it on the fire to boil to the crack degree. Great attention should be paid to the quantity or proportion of water added to the sugar,—neither too much nor too little; the excess of water, by prolonging the time required to boil the sugar, increases its colour; while an insufficient quantity, has a tendency to grease and grain the sugar: both these objections may easily be avoided by adding about half a pint of cold water to each pound of sugar. While boiling the sugar, and in order to prevent its acquiring colour, even before it

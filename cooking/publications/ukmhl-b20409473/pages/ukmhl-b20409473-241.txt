FLAVOURED CANDY TABLETS. 201 bon-like bands upon ready oiled, or floured round sticks; as these become partially stilY, pull, or rather slide them off, and join the ends so as to form them into rings. Let it be distinctly understood that the whole of the operation tending to the production of imitation ribbon must be conducted close to the stove fire, in order to avoid the stiffening of the sugar while it is being worked. It is also necessary to remind ladies who are afraid of spoiling their hands, that they had better forego the attempt, as they would be likely to fail; not so much through fear of burning their hands, but because they really ivould be very likely to do so. It is an unquestionable fact, that success in the production of well made sugar ribbon, requires great presence of mind, intelligent activity, and much taste and tact. When it is intended to produce ribbon of two shades, such as white, and an}^ other colour, as rose- pink, blue, yellow, or brown, the colour (ground wet) must be added on the slab to one-half of the sugar, and worked by another person separately from the white band; as soon as both are sufficiently worked, lay them side by side, cut the double band in two or more pieces, and let each be given to an assistant to be pulled out in thin strips and twisted round the sticks as before indicated. Imitation ribbon may also be formed of two colours, by joining green and pink, pink and blue, and brown with any colour. Eemember that the shades of colour must be delicate.

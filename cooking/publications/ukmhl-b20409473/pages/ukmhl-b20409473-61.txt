The fruit must be rubbed through a clean hair sieve into a cold white pan, then add fourteen ounces of pounded sugar to each pound of pulp, and half an ounce of cream of tartar: mix thoroughly, fill the bottles, cork them tight, and tie them down with wire. The bottles should be kept in an ice-house, if possible, and where this is not practicable, let them be laid down in a cold cellar.

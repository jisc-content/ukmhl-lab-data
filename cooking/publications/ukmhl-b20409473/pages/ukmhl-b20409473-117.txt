COLOURED AND PERFUMED SUGARS. 77 by confectioners granite sugar, and serves as the ground work for the production of the following coloured sugars. No. 190.—To prepare Pink Granite Sugar. Put the granite sugar, prepared as in the foregoing number, on a^ clean plate, add a pinch of carmine and a few drops of rose water, and with both hands rub all together until the sugar has become evenly coloured of a delicate pink or rose colour; dry the sugar in the screen—very moderate heat—rubbing it between your fingers frequently, to prevent its clogging together, and when dry, put it away in a clean bottle or paper box for use. No. 191.—To prepare Yellow Granite Sugar. For this colour use gamboge, and proceed as in the former case; the little moisture required to rub the gamboge on a plate will suffice to saturate the sugar. No. 192.—To prepare Orange Granite Sugar. Make an infusion of a good pinch of hay saffron with a spoonful of water boiled in a sugar pan until the moisture is nearly absorbed, and then squeeze out the colour through a bit of muslin into the granite sugar on a plate; a few drops will suffice to colour the sugar; remember that it must not be so much moistened as to cause the grains to clog together ; dry the sugar in the usual manner.

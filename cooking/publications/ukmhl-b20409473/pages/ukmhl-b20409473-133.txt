ON DESSERT CAKES IN GENERAL. 9rS It is usual to make this kind of paste late in the evening of the previous day when it is required for use. The first thing on the following morning the brioche paste must be turned out of the napkin on the slab; then shake a little flour under and over it, and fold over the paste half a dozen times, each time kneading it down with the knuckles; put the paste back again into the bowl as before ; and, in about two hours afterwards, it will be ready for baking. No. 229.—A Large Brioche. Prepare the paste as directed in the foregoing number, mould two-thirds of it into a round ball by kneading it well together, and press this with the open part downwards in a tin hoop placed on a baking plate; then knead the remainder into another ball, and with some water or egg, fasten this on the centre of the first ball; egg it over with a paste brush, score the sides with a knife, and push in the oven, moderate heat. As soon as the brioche begins to rise, and has acquired a light golden colour, cover it with paper : it will require about an hour's baking. This kind of cake is fittest for tea or breakfast. No. 230.—Small Fancy Brioches for Breakfast. Prepare the paste as in No. 228, and make it up into twelve small brioches, to be shaped as directed for a large brioche. Brioche paste may also be made up in different shapes, such as twists, finger rolls, half moons, &c., these form a welcome addition to the breakfast table or tea tray.

BISCOTTINI AND PATIENCE BISCUITS, ETC. 185 biscuits with a plain tin cutter; lay them in rows on a slightly buttered baking-sheet, prick them all over, pass a brush dipped in milk over their surfaces, sprinkle salt upon them, and bake the biscuits in sharp heat eight minutes. No. 312.—Patience Biscuits. Ingredients: 6 whites of eggs, 1 oz. of flour, 12 oz. of sugar, and a few drops of essence of cinnamon or a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Whip the whites of eggs quite firm, then mix in the sugar and the flavouring, and afterwards thoroughly incorporate the flour; lay out the biscuits with a biscuit-forcer upon baking-sheets (buttered and floured over) in the form of narrow short fingers, dredge them over with sugar, set them in the screen (not too hot) for about ten minutes, push them into the oven at moderate heat, and bake them of a fawn colour; when done, use a knife to lift them off the sheet. No. 313.—Patience Biscuits another way. Ingredients: 10 eggs, 8 oz. of sugar, 6 oz, of flour, and 1 oz. of candied orange flowers bruised. Whisk the yolks with the sugar and flavouring in a copper egg bowl over a very slack stove fire until the batter forms a thick creamy substance, then add the whisked whites and the flour, mix lightly, and lay out the biscuits in the same manner as in the preceding case, in the form of small round drops, dredge them over with sugar, and finish as in the former case.

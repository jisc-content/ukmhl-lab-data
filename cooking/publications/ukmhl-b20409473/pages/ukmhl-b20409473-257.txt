LIQUEUB BONBONS, PSYCHe's KISSES, ETC. 217 the ball degree, or feather degree; the consistency of the latter degree is ascertained by first dipping the finger in cold water, and then in the boiling sugar, immediately back again into the cold water and out again; if you find that, by pressing this particle of sugar between the finger and thumb, it presents the appearance and substance of glue, the sugar boiler is then to be removed from the fire, and immersed in a pie dish containing cold water, in order to cool the sugar quickly; a lid must be placed over the pan to prevent the sugar from forming a crust on its surface. When any kind of essence, liqueur, essence of coffee, or fruit juice, is intended to be added, the sugar must be boiled to the full ball degree, so that when pressed between the fingers, it is easily rolled into a ball or pellet; the flavouring is then to be worked into it. No. 453.—How to Cast, or Mould, Liqueur Bonbons. It is a rule to imprint the forms or moulds in the smooth levelled starch powder contained in flat boxes previously to boiling the sugar, so that they may be ready for running, or casting the preparation into the forms:—a long spouted sugar boiler should be used for this purpose; and, as soon as the bonbons are cast, their surfaces should be thinly covered over with starch powder sifted over them, to avoid the possibility of there being any lumps, as these would tend to pierce their surfaces, and spoil them. The box is now to be placed in the screen or hot closet (moderate heat), and left to set and to dry the bonbons for about fifteen hours.

45 COMPOTES IN GENERAL. causes the sugar to become almost calcined ; in wliich state it is barely fit for making colouring for cooking purposes. No. 107.—Compote of Apples. Cut the apples in halves, scoop out the cores neatly, either turn or peel them in straight bands of equal breadths; and as each is turned out of hand, drop it into some acidulated water; simmer in twenty- eight degrees syrup until the apples are partially done through, and allow them to steep in their syrup in a basin until they are dished up ; they must have been well drained on a napkin; decorate the compote with angelica, the red peel of apples, and different sorts of jDreserve, all previously cut in thin sheets or slices, and stamped out with tin cutters, in ornamental shapes to form tasteful designs upon each piece of apple—representing wreaths, stars, &c. Cover the whole with a thin sheet of apple jelly asv indicated in No. 94. No. 108—Compote of whole Apples. First, remove the core in its whole length by in- serting a long tin cutter (tapering at one end) at each end of the apple, and with the point of the index finger force out the core ; by using this precaution, you will not split the apple ; place the apples in acidu- lated water to keep them white as they are turned spirally out of hand. Finish the compote as directed in the foregoing case.

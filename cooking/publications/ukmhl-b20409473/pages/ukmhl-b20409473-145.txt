The paste being ready, cover some baking sheets with wafer-paper, and lay out the macaroons in the form of small round balls about the size of very small wal- nuts; take care to place them at least an inch apart from each other; and when the sheet is full, pass a wet paste brush over their surfaces, push in the oven —very moderate heat, and bake them of a light fawn colour:—When done, and cold, break away any excess of wafer that may cling to the edges of the macaroons, and keep them for use in a dry place.

No. 202, work both together until thoroughly incorporated, use this to fill a biscuit forcer, and push out the macaroons upon wafer paper, as shown in No. 249. Bear in mind that macaroons must be baked in very moderate heat; otherwise, if the heat of your oven should be at all excessive it would cause the ma- caroons to run into each other, and thus produce a useless mass.

.S36 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 2 pounds of lump sugar ; pour 2 quarts of boiling water to this, stir all together, tie a bladder over the top of the pitcher, and set it aside under lock and key to allow the ingredients to steep undisturbed for a couple of days. At the end of that time boil 2 quarts of sweet genuine milk, add this to the other ingredients, mix thoroughly, and an hour afterwards filter the punch through a clean beaver jelly bag. When filtered, bottle off the punch, cork down tight, and keep the bottles in a good cellar. When required for use let it be well iced. No. 695.—Regent Punch. Put the following ingredients into a freezing-pot ready imbedded in ice, viz.: 3 gills of syrup, 3 gills of pine apple syrup, 1 pint of brandy, 1 pint of old rum, 1 gill of Kirschenwasser, 1 gill of lemon juice, a small teacupful of green tea not strong, and a bottle of genuine champagne. The rind of a Seville orange should be steeped in the syrup previously to using it. Mix and half freeze the punch similarly to sorbet or granito. Note.—This, and several of the following kinds of punch, are far better adapted to follow turtle soup than Eoman punch, from the fact that they are not so cloying. No. 696.-Bishop.

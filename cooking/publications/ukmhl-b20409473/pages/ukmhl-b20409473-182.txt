142 TPIE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. No. 326.—Brown Bread Hard Biscuits Ingredients: Ij B. of brown wheaten flour, 1 oz. of fresh butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and rather better than J pint of water. Proceed as for Thick Captain's, No. 328. These biscuits are also called digestive biscuits. No. 327.—Echaud6s, or Beer Biscuits. Ingredients : 1 IB. of flour, 4 oz. of butter, 1 oz. of carbonate of soda, 1 oz. of salt, and 6 eggs. Mix all the ingredients, with the salt and soda dis- solved in a spoonful of water; work all together on the slab with the hands, rubbing the paste with the flat- tened fist, and working it to and fro with the knuckles, until the paste becomes thoroughly elastic; it must then be put on a floured plate, covered over, and set aside in a very cool place till the next day. The paste is then to be rolled out with the hands on the floured slab into the form of a long rope about one inch and a half thick, and cut into pieces the size of a walnut; these are to be dropped separately into a pan of boiling water on the fire, and when they have all risen to the surface of the water, are to be taken out with a skim- mer, and put into a large pan of cold water, and al- lowed to steep in this for about three hours; the echaudes are now to be drained on a sieve, placed in separate rows at two inches distance from each other in a very deep sort of baking-sheet, or sautapan (in France, they have covered double iron baking- sheets for this purpose), and are to be baked in sharp heat: 20 minutes.

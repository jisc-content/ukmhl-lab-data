THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 366 I have very generally recommended the use of syrup of different degrees of strength for sweetening ices, as constituting by far the simplest and easiest method for amalgamation with, and giving body to, the other ingredients composing the ices; and I maintain my opinion that, for the use of practitioners generally, and more particularly the inexperienced in such matters, syrup is the safest medium for the purpose. Yet, holding the Neapolitan method of preparing sugar for ices in the highest estimation, I recommend the system, especially as regards the confection of fruit water ices. Owing to the sugar being boiled to 38 degrees strength, and about half grained by working it while hot with a spoon up against the sides of the pan, a substance is produced which admits of being diluted with the addition of a larger proportion of fruit juice than would be needed if using 24 or 28 degree syrup; thus the Neapolitan method affords the means of making the ices richer in fruit; in itself this constitutes a great advantage, and more- over mainly contributes to give greater body to the composition. When using Neapolitan sugar for ices, it must first be dissolved with a little water on the fire, poured into a basin, and the fruit juice added by degrees in sufficient quantity to dilute it down to 22 degrees by the saccharometer or syrup gauge. Great attention should be paid to avoid overcharging your ices with sugar, for in that state they would be too rich or ropy, and are difficult to freeze; but in such cases the composition may be instantly rectified by adding a little fruit juice, or even water. While, however, it is

176 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. sponge, "throw in a small handful of salt, work all together, add just enough lukewarm soft water to enable you to work the whole into a firm compact smooth dough; and after having kneaded this with your fists until it becomes stiff and comparatively tough, shake some flour over it, and again cover it over with a cloth in order to keep it warm so as to assist its fermentation. If all that has been described has been properly managed, the fermentation will be accom- plished in less than half an hour. Meanwhile as the bread is being thus far prepared, you will have heated your oven to a satisfactory degree of heat, and brushed it thoroughly clean with a damp mop. Divide your dough into two, or four-pound loaves, knead them into round, oval, or long shapes, making a hole at the top with your thumb, and immediately put them out of hand into the oven to bake, closing the oven door upon them. In about two hours' time the 4-Ib. loaves will be done, the 2-Tb. loaves in less time : they are then to be taken out of the oven, and allowed to become quite cold before they are put away in the bread-cupboard.

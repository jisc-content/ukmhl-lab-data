The strictest care and attention should be paid to the proportions of ingredients composing different ices, and also to the flavouring, for while small quantities of the latter, recommended in some cases, will prove sufficiently powerful to impart a pleasant taste, an over dose, on the other hand, would produce an un- satisfactory result. Let it therefore be remembered that, as a general rule, it is far better to run the chance of using too small a quantity of flavouring than an excess.

CARAMEL FRUITS AND CREAM BONBONS. 211 according to their natural divisions; observing that the thin skins covering the pulp of the fruit must not be at all torn; as the pieces of orange are so far turned out of hand in a perfect state, place them on a wire tray to dry for an hour or so in the ordinary warmth of a kitchen. As the quarters of oranges are turned out of hand, a delicately cut wooden twig about six inches long should be stuck into the broad part: this twig serves to dip the fruit into the sugar effec- tually without burning your fingers. Boil one pound of sugar to the crack, dip the pieces of oranges into it, drain off all excess of sugar, and, as you turn them out of hand, rest them upon oiled wire trays which, when full, are to be set aside in a cool atmosphere to allow the sugar to stiffen upon the fruit. When about to use the caramel, pass your fingers under the wire tray in order to lift or push up the quarters of oranges without breaking or damaging the sugar that covers them ; and dish them up, either in a compotier upon green leaves, on a dessert dish or drum, or else, as part of a dress-plate, as will be here- after described. No. 443.~Caramel Fruits in general. All kinds of fresh fruits intended to be prepared for dessert in the form of caramels, such as cherries, large strawberries, greengages, plums, or grapes, should be first freed from their stalks, stuck upon small wooden splinters or twigs, and prepared in given necessary quantities as described in No. 442, and finished as therein indicated. r2

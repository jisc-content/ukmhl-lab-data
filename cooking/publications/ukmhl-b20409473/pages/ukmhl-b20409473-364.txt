For this purpose it is essential that you should possess a number of dip-models, made of lead fastened to a wire with a hook at the end; these are made in great variety of form, representing the full blossom of almost every species of flowers; (for patterns of these see Adams's illustrations) two iron rods or skewers should be driven, three feet from each other, into a thick board or table, and a wire extended from one to the other. This contrivance must be prepared before commencing operations. The leaden models must be got ready oiled to hand on a clean dish. Boil the sugar to the crack degree, and then colour it to the shade required for imitating the flower intended to be produced, so far as this object can be accomplished with one shade of colour only; add the colour at the last stage of boiling. When the sugar is ready, dip each model in it, up to the verge of the edge, but no further; for if the sugar reaches over the edge, it would be impossible to remove the flowers without breaking them. As each leaden model is dipped and drained, hang it by the hook upon the dis- tended wire to cool and stiffen; a small knot of sugar appended to the pointed end of the model, should be gently pinched out before it becomes cold, to form the stalk. Pinks, roses, tulips, convolvuli, blue-bells, pansies, and many other flowers may easily be formed in cara- mel sugar by this very simple method; almost every kind of leaves also, may be imitated with similar tools.

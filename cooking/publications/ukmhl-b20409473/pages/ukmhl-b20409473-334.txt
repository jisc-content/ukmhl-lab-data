THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 280 Ho. 597.—Neapolitan Cake on a Pedestal or Stand. Prepare an ornamented Neapolitan cake as in No. 370, and decorate it after the patterns designed in illustration No. 6 ; when finished, place it upon an ornamental pedestal similar to the one there repre- sented. No. 598.—Croqne-en-bonclie of quarters of Oranges on a Stand. The oranges most suitable for this purpose are the Medina or Tangerine oranges, because they are less Juicy, and because the pellicule, or transparent skin, which covers the natural divisions of the fruit, being comparatively stronger, it is less liable to break and let the juice out on the caramel, which pro- duces an unsatisfactory result, inasmuch as by melting the sugar it causes the structure to give way. The quarters of oranges are to be prepared as in No. 442, and when they have become set and cold, are to be built up inside a high charlotte mould previously rubbed with oil of almonds; the quarters of oranges must be slightly dipped in sugar boiled to the crack degree, as they are built up in circular reversed rows, as shown in illustration No. 7. The croque-en-houche must not be removed from its mould until the sugar with which it is stuck together has cooled; and when it is turned out perfect, it is to be further decorated by additions of ornamental designs in caramel sugar, in a similar manner to the decorations portrayed in the illustration.

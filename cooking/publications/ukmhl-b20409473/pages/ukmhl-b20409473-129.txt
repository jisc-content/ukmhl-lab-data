DIFFERENT MANNERS OE PREPARING ALMONDS. 89 No. 224.—Orgeate of Almonds. To one pound of skinned almonds add one pound of sugar, pound as directed in the foregoing case, adding occasionally a few drops of orange-flower water. No. 225.—To make Almond Paste. Scald, skin and soak the almonds for three hours, drain and pound them, adding occasionally a few drops of orange-flower water, and when thoroughly pulverised into a soft compact pulp, rub this through a hair sieve on to a plate; add the pulp to an ounce of soaked and passed gum dragon,—that is, the gum after being soaked in a gill of tepid water, must be squeezed through a cloth. Place the prepared gum on a clean marble slab and work it with the fist until it becomes white and elastic, then add the almond pulp and half a pound of fine sifted icing sugar, and continue to work all together until well amalgamated, adding gradually icing sugar enough to produce a firm, compact, elastic paste. The use of this will be shown hereafter. No. 226.—Almond Paste another way. Boil a pound of sugar to the crack, add fourteen ounces of almond pulp, stir all together with a wooden spoon over a slow fire until the paste ceases to adhere to the sides of the pan, and then work in half an ounce of prepared gum dragon with more icing sugar on the slab.

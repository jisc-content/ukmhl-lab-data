202 THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. No. 430.â€”Imitation of Celery in Sugar. The process for the preparation of imitation celery is very much like that indicated for imitation ribbon. Boil the sugar to the crack, add just enough saffron to give it a straw-coloured tinge, approaching as nearly as may be to the natural colour of white celery. The sugar when ready, is to be first worked on the slab, afterwards with the hands as directed for ribbon; and, when the sugar has been pulled out sufficiently to lessen its elasticity without rendering it at all brittle, great care and attention ought to be paid when finally pulling out the sugar, in order to form the stems or ribs of the celery; indeed, it is essential to have an assistant, whose share in the operation would consist in pressing the stems together at the thick end, while the loose ends must be held downwards to keep them apart; thus giving lightness and elegance to the celery, which, for our purpose, should, contrary to perfection in nature, be spread out so as to resemble that vege- table in its neglected growth. Thus, eight or nine stems being joined together so as to form a perfect head of celery measuring from twelve to eighteen inches long, tie a string round the root and suspend it to a nail, or distended wire, that it may become cold and stiff, when it may be fastened at the root end with caramel sugar upon a disc, that is a six-inch diameter liat piece of baked confectioner's paste (or even a round of thick pasteboard would serve the purpose), to afford a safe base, so as to insure its standing up in a firmly upright position. The celery may be garnished round the base with rout cakes made in imitation of vege- tables : see No. 276.

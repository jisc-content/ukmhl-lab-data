These are then to be moulded, or rolled with the hand, into round balls, and afterwards flattened out upon slightly buttered baking-sheets, set to rise in a warm place, and when risen satisfactorily, to be brushed over with beaten egg, and baked in moderately sharp heat. These cakes are cut in two or three slices, toasted, buttered, and served for breakfast, &c.

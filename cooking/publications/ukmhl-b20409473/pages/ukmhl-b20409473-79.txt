COMPOTES IN GENERAL. S9 operations. Compotes, to be perfect, must be neat as well as elegant; and to attain this perfection, it is essential that the fruits should be both well trimmed and smoothly peeled, or, as we term it, roundly and smoothly turned in their natural forms.—To turn, in confectionary phraseology, means to remove the rind or peel of fruits, by endeavouring to use the sharp edge of a small knife, so as to effect the same result as that which might be produced by the use of the lathe, or turning machine; in other v/ords, the fruit, when turned out of hand, should be well rounded and perfectly smooth. Whether a pear or an apple is intended to remain whole or in halves, the process is nearly the same. If any fruit is intended to be turned whole for compotes, such as pears, for instance; first, scrape the stalk, and then with the i3ear held in the left hand, turn it on the edge of the knife held in the right hand—so as for the knife to act upon the fruit in a w^ay to produce spiral grooves forming the curves of a corkscrew— tapering from the thick end or head of the pear down to the stalk. If an apple is being turned whole, roundness and smoothness are the chief consider- ations ; if either of these fruits is intended to be dressed in halves or quarters, let the fruit be pared in even bands lengthways; this method produces also a pretty effect. Oranges and lemons should always, when dressed whole, be turned spirally. 'Eo, 94.—Apple and other Jellies for Compotes.

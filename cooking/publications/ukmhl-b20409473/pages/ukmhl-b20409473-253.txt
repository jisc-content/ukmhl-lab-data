CARAMEL FRUITS AND CREAM BONBONS. 218 of muslin into a basin, the essence of vanilla added to it, and filled in with as much icing sugar as it will absorb; w^ork the whole into a rather stiff, yet soft and elastic body. Dissolve the chocolate with about a table-spoonful of w^ater in the oven, work this thoroughly smooth with a spoon, and incorporate it with two whites of eggs of royal icing. Fill| a biscuit forcer, having a quarter inch tin tube adapted to it, with the white vanilla cream preparation, and push it out upon a large sheet of paper well dredged over with fine sugar ; and, as the contents of the forcer are pushed out with the left hand, with a small knife held in the right hand, cut off the white cream as it is pressed out, in pieces the size of small filbert kernels; as each sheet of these drops is completed, place it on a baking-plate for ten minutes in the screen, merely to dry their surfaces. Next dip each of these white balls in the chocolate icing, holding one at a time upon the tip of a fork, so as to be able to place it out of hand on a close made wire tray, and when each is filled set them to dry for about ten minutes in the screen ; they may afterwards be put away between sheets of paper in a box.

THE PREPARATION OF DRIED FRUITS. 71 No. ITO.—Dried Pine-Apple. Peel, thoroughly clean, and pick out the brown specks or eyes of the pine-apple ; cut it up in slices rather better than a quarter of an inch thick, or else in finger-like lengths; give these a ten minutes' gentle boiling, and put them away in a pan till the next day; give four more fashions, as directed for cherries, and finish in the same manner. No. 171.—Dried, or Candied Oranges in Quarters. Divide the oranges in quarters, pick out the pips, and gently boil the fruit in plenty of water until the peel becomes a little soft, so as to admit of a quill being easily run through it; the quarters must then be drained on a sieve to run off all excess of moisture, and let them simmer in twenty-eight degrees syrup for ten minutes, then to be poured into a white pan, and left to steep till the next day. Give four more fashions, or boilings, to the syrup separately from the oranges ; and after drying the quarters upon wire trays in the screen, dip each quarter in the semi-grained sugar before drying it a last time. No. 172.—Dried, or Candied Orange Peel. Cut the oranges in halves, carefully remove the pulp of the fruit, give the peels a gentle boiling until they become sufficiently soft to admit of running a quill easily through them, drain, and cool them in plenty of cold water, and finish as directed in the foregoing number.

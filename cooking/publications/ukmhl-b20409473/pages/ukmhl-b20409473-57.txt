17 CHAPTER III. TO PRESERVE THE PULP OF DIFFERENT FRUITS FOR MAKING ICES. ISo. 42.--T0 preserve the pulp of Red Currants. Place twelve pounds of ripe red currants with four pounds of ripe raspberries in a large white pan, add one quart of water; with both hands perfectly clea'n thoroughly bruise the fruit—so as to crush every berry, and you will find that as you press and •squeeze the currants, the stalks will gather in your hands; they must be thrown aside, for, if allowed to remain, they impart an acrid flavour to the fruit. The fruit thus bruised, use one of Adams and Son^s Fruit pressing machines (see Illustrations) to extract the juice or pulp, and pour it as it runs out, into a larga earthen pan. Red Currants.

IMITATION HAMS, WEDDING CAKE, ETC. 295 white royal icing piped on after the design shown in illustration No. 26. No. 619.-A Wedding Cake. Prepare the cake of such dimensions and weight as occasion may require; bearing in mind that if the cake is intended to be a large one, it must be baked in separate quarters, in tin moulds made and calculated to turn out portions or parts which, when fitted together, will form a perfect circle. For the preparation of the cake and the icing thereof, see No. 237. The decoration shown in the Frontis- piece to this volume is composed of wreaths of blush roses, and the blossom and buds of the orange tree ; the whole being surmounted with a floral fountain and a Cupid. The initials of the happy pair may be added. No. 620.-On Spinning Sugar. Practice alone will enable you to attain to any degree of proficiency in the art of sugar spinning; and as it constitutes one of the richest, as well as one of the most useful branches of ornamentation in confectionary, it is well worth your while to bestow some time and labour upon its study; in order that through frequent experi- ments, you may arrive at perfection. A most important element of success in sugar spin- ning, depends on the quality of the sugar used, and the degree of perfection to which it is boiled. The latter is so essential that I have thought it advisable to introduce here some instructions on boiling sugar for spinning.

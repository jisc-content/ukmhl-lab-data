For the formation and design of the meringue, you will be guided by illustration No. 5. The meringue itself may be baked in rings of small meringues over- laying each other, and afterwards these rings may be raised up upon each other to form the shape there represented; or else a cylindrical shape made of pastafrolle-paste, and previously baked upon or in a high narrow charlotte mould, may be used to raise the meringue upon in manner following: Fasten the cylindrical form of pastafrolle-paste upon a circular flat piece of the same paste, cover this all over evenly and smoothly with stiff meringue paste, No. 346 or No. 349, dredge it over with sugar, then dry it in the oven, and afterwards pipe small pointed meringues in equal rows up the sides of the cylinder, dredge this over with sugar, and bake it of a very light fawn colour. The meringue, when finished, is to be placed upon an ornamental pedestal or stand, the foundation of which is to be made of confectioners' paste, coloured with granite sugar; the decorations are intended to be either in gum paste, or in royal icing, piped on in imitation of the designs foreshown, or any other more suitable to your taste or fancy. The meringue should be filled with whipped cream and strawberries on the top, and covered with a small sultana of spun sugar.

87 CHAPTER IX. ON THE DIFFERENT MANNERS OF PREPARING ALMONDS. Throw the almonds into a pan containing boiling water, allow them to remain in this on the fire until you find that on taking one of the almonds between your fingers you can easily push off the skin by pinching the almond between the finger and thumb; then drain off the water, cool the almonds in cold water, drain them again, and, as you rub off the skins or hulls with your hands in a cloth, let the almonds be thrown into cold water with a little salt, and when washed clean, drain and dry them in another cloth. When the almonds are prepared, as in the foregoing case, insert the point of a knife at the end, when you will find that they will readily split in halves at their natural division.

IMITATION OF FRUITS IN ALMOND PASTE, ETC. 245 vegetables, and several sorts of flowers, may be repro- duced in this manner : much care and taste, as well as considerable intelligence, will necessarily be required to insure success in this beautiful art. E"o. 521.—Barley Sugar. Break a pound of fine loaf sugar in small lumps, put it with three gills of water in a sugar boiler on the fire to boil, skim it and boil it to the crack degree. No. 105, then add the juice of a lemon and a few drops of essence of lemon, give the sugar a boil, cool the bottom of the pan in cold water, and when the first heat has subsided pour the sugar on a marble slab very slightly smeared with oil of almonds; as the sugar spreads lift it up all round in a heap with a knife, and as soon as it has cooled a little, cut off portions the size of a finger, roll them in the form of round sticks, twist them so as to resemble cords, and place them on a baking sheet slightly oiled to become cold and stiff. Keep the barley-sugar in well-stoppered glass jars in a dry place. Ho. 522.—Apple Sugar, Eouen Method. Boil a pound of fine loaf sugar with eight ounces of plain water and eight ounces of apple juice, add a tea- spoonful of acetic acid, and when the sugar is boiled to the crack degree, proceed as directed in the foregoing article. Note.—This sugar in addition to the apple juice may also be flavoured with orange-flower water, rose water, or cinnamon essence.

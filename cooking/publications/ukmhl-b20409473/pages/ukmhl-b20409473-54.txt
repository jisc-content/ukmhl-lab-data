THE ABT OF CONFECTIONARY. 14 No. 32.--TO bottle Large Plums. All large plums should be first pricked with a needle and dropped out of hand into a preserving pan containing twenty-two degrees syrup just off the fire; when all your fruit is in the S3Tup, set the pan (covered over to keep out the dust, &c.) either inside a hot screen, or else uipon a trivet over a smothered charcoal fire, until the syrup becomes quite hot; the plums must then be removed carefully with a large confectionary spoon into a white jDan, and set aside until the next day, in order that they may become charged with sufficient syrup to give them substance; and, on the day following, use a spoon to fill the bottles with the plums so far prepared; give their syrup a boil up, and skim it, and when nearly cold fill up the bottles; cork, and tie down. Time: fifteen minutes' ebullition. ITo. 33.—To bottle Plums a plainer way. All plums of ordinary size — such as Orleans, Mussel, &c.—are to be picked into the bottles, shaken down close without bruising, filled up with twenty-two degrees syrup, corked and tied down. Time : twenty minutes^ ebullition. No. 34.—To bottle Damsons. Proceed as indicated in the preceding article for the preparation of plums. Time : fifteen minutes' ebulli- tion.

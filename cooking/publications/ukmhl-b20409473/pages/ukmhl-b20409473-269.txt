Ingredients: iB. of pulp (the currants and rasp- berries in equal proportions boiled, and afterwards rubbed through a sieve), lib. of sifted sugar, v Stir both together in a copper sugar boiler or pre- serving pan over a brisk fire, until the paste becomes sufficiently reduced to show the bottom of the pan as you draw the spoon across it; then proceed to lay out the drops about the size of a florin, using a spouted sugar boiler for the purpose. The drops should then be placed in the screen (very moderate heat), to dry for about an hour or so. When the drops are dried, use a thin knife to remove them from the tin sheet on which they have been laid out; and put them away between sheets of paper in closed boxes, to be kept in a dry place.

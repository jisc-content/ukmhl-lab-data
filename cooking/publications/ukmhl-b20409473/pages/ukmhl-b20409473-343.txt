ORNAMENTAL CARAMEL BASKETS, ETC. 285 No. 608—A Croqiie-en-l)Ouche composed of different kinds of Fruits in Caramel. Prepare the following different kinds of fruits in caramel, as directed in No. 442 and following numbers : greengages, Orleans plums, grapes, cherries, quarters of pink pears, and quarters of oranges, &c. Failing fresh fruits, preserved fruits answer the purpose. In this case, and in the event of fruit in syrup being used, care must be taken to drain and partially dry it in the screen, before dipping it in the caramel; for if allowed to retain any moisture on the exterior, the fruit would not take the sugar. Thus, the caramel fruits being ready to your hand, use a plain high round mould, slightly rubbed outside with oil of almonds, to build or mount the caramel fruits up outside in circular rows, commencing with the larger fruits at the base of the mould, and ending with the smallest; so that, when the croque-en-bouche is lifted off the mould upon its dish, the small fruit will be uppermost: this arrange- ment is calculated to give a lighter effect than would be produced, if the reverse principle were adopted. The ornamentation consists of green angelica and spun sugar. Illustration No. 17 is intended to guide jour labours. No. 609.—A Croqne-en-bouclie composed of Dates and Preserved Green Almonds.

THE ART OF CONFECTIONARY. 308 in with as much fine white dry icing sugar as they will absorb, to produce a soft paste; add a few drops of acetic acid, a pinch of cream of tartar, and either a small quantity of prepared gumdragon, or a spoonful of starch powder: the addition of these ingredients gives a greater body and elasticity to the icing, and also causes it to dry much more quickly. The icing should be worked with a spoon for half an hour; and, to be in a state of perfection, as you withdraw the spoon, the point of icing left behind should stand erect. These flowers are piped when of some size, on the pointed end of an egg, or something of the kind, and, after being dried, are easily shifted off; the smaller sort may be piped on the backs of small tartlet pans. You commence by making a large or small dot, according to the size of the flowers to be imitated, and then pipe the petals up against and round this dot. The pistils are to be imitated with bits of waxed thread, the ends of which must be dipped in yellow granite sugar; the stalks are made of wire covered with green paper, and the green leaves piped on the stems after the flowers are mounted. It will be apparent, that the icing should be coloured to suit the tint of the flower you are about to imitate. Yet, it must be admitted that, providing you are desirous more closely to imitate nature, the flowers should be made in white icing, and afterwards shaded with powdered colours, using floss cotton attached round the end of an uncut quill for the purpose of adapting the colour, and spreading it delicately and softly on the flower.

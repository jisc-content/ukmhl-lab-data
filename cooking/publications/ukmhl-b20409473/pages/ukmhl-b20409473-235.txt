FRUIT PASTES AND DROPS, ETC. 195 The method here described of soaking the plaster of Paris moulds in water instead of slightly greasing them with oil of almonds, according to the more general practice, has this advantage: the objects being cast without oil, the surface is brighter and of a bettei colour. When copper moulds are used for casting Vases, Baskets, &c., they must necessarily be slightly smeared with oil of sweet almonds, to prevent the sugar from sticking to the sides, and to ensure a perfect delivery of the objects cast in them. No. 418.—Vases, Baskets, Figures, &c., cast in Grained Sugar. Plaster of Paris moulds described in the preceding No. 417, are used for this purpose, and are to be prepared as therein directed. The sugar being boiled to the ball degree, No. 104, add a few drops of acetic acid, and work the sugar with the back part of the bowl of a silver tablespoon, up against the side of the sugar boiler, fetching up the whole in turns, so that every portion may acquire an opalised, or whitish colour; as soon at the sugar has been worked up to this state, which constitutes graining," pour it immediately into the ready prepared mould; and when it has become perfectly set firm in the centre, you may turn the Vase, Basket, or whatever the object may be, out of its mould, and place it, either in the screen or hot closet to dry,—very moderate heat, not more than 15 degrees Fahrenheit.

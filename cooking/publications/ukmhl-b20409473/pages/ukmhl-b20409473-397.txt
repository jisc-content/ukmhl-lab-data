383 GRANITI FOR EVENING PARTIES. No. 687.-Coffee Granito. Ingredients: 1 pint of strong bright coflfee, ^ pint of syrup of 28 degrees strength. Mix the coffee and syrup in a freezer, twirl the composition first to the right and then to the left, and as it becomes frozen up the sides of the freezer, detach it by scraping it down into the centre with the spatula, bearing in mind that granito must be only half frozen, so as to resemble snowy-like water, just sufficiently liquid to admit of its being poured into glasses to be handed round to the guests. No. 688.—Another Method of Freezing Graniti. The- composition should be put into water-bottles or jugs, twirled round in the ice, and as the contents become frozen up the interior of the bottles, a narrow wooden spatula should be thrust in for the purpose of scraping down the frozen portion into the liquid. When graniti are frozen in perfection, the minute particles of the frozen portion of the composition, resemble a numerous constellation of small crystals. No. 689.—Claret Granito. To one quart of orangeade add a bottle of claret, and freeze as above. No. 690.-Sherry Granito. To one quart of lemonade add a bottle of sherry, and freeze.

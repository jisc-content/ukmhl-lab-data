A quarter of a pound of sugar ; ten ounces of butter; one pound of flour ; three large or four small eggs ; a little nutmeg. Work the sugar and butter together till quite soft, throw in the eggs that have been previously well beaten, and then add the flour and a little nutmeg, knead twenty minutes and let it rise ; then roll it between your hands into round balls the size of a small potato, but do not add any more flour; flour your pasteboard lightly and roll out each ball into a thin oval the size of the hand, cut with a knife three slits like bars in the centre of the oval, cross the two centre ones with your fingers, and draw up the two sides between, put your finger through and drop into it boiling lard, which must be ready in a small stewpan. Turn them as they rise, and when a nice brown, take them up with a fork, and lay them on a tray with paper underneath them. The lard must be boiling before putting them in ; a stewpan wide enough to put three in BAKED AND BO For boiled puddings you will require either a mould, a basin, or a pudding- cloth : the former should have a close- fitting cover, and be rubbed over the inside with butter before putting the pudding in it, that it may not stick to the side; the cloth should be dipped in boiling water, and then well floured on the inside. A pudding-cloth must be kept very clean, and in a dry place. Bread-puddings should be at once answers best, and when the lard would froth too much add a little fresh before putting in any more. When all are done, save the lard in a basin, as it will answer, by adding a little more fresh, to use again. MINCE MEAT. Apple Mince Meat. 506.

LED PUDDING-S. tied very loosely, as they swell very much in boiling. The water must be boiling when the pudding is put in, and continue to boil until it is done.

PREFACE. In preparing a People’s Edition of the Model Cookery Book, the Publishers have been careful that such receipts should be selected as would best suit the requirements of housekeepers with small incomes. At the same time a few dishes have been added for home entertainments, &rc., of a rather more expensive kind. Plain cooks will find full instructions in it, by which they may execute any receipts hereafter placed in their hands, and it is hoped that by all readers this condensation of the “ Model Cookery ” will be found generally useful. Bedford Street, Covent Garden, May, 1868.

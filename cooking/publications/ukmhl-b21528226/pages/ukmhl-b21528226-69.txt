Strain through a sieve, and pour back the liquor into the stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter. When boiling, throw in a small leek, a few mari- gold leaves cut up, half a pint of green peas (or asparagus cut up small when green peas cannot be procured), or, what is by many preferred, the white heart of a cabbage cut up, about a pintbasinful, or rather more; half a teacupful of parsley chopped small, and a bunch of thyme. Mix two heaped table- spoonfuls of flour in a pint of milk, the blossoms of four or five marigolds plucked, and when the peas or asparagus are done, throw it into the stewpan, stirring all the time till it comes to a boil; then let it boil ten minutes to take off the rawness of the flour, with the lid off the stewpan, or it would boil over. Some, who prefer the parsley green, do not put it in till after the milk boils. Before dishing up, season with a little salt, as the salt is apt to curdle the milk if added before. Have ready thin

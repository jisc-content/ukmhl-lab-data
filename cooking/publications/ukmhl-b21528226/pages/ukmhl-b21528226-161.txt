147 Mode of Folding Table-napkins. To Fold the Mitre.—The napkin must be folded in three, thus :—Fold one third over, turn it backwards, and thus make the three folds. Fold both ends to meet in the middle. Take the left-hand corner, a, and fold it across in a right angle. Take the opposite corner, b, on the left hand at the top, and fold it in the same manner ; you will thus form figure'i. Turn over and fold in halves lengthwise; open the points, and you will have figure 2. Bend the point, a, towards the right, and tuck it in the groove, c ; turn the point, b, backwards towards the right hand, and tuck it in as at a ; you will then have figure 3—The Mitre. The Water Lily.—Have a square napkin and fold it like a half handkerchief. Then take the two opposite points and make them meet on the centre one, which forms a square. Take the bottom corner, opposite the points, and roll it up as at figure 4. Turn the napkin over, and roll point a to about the centre. Take point b, and tuck it in the groove ; raise it, and you have figure 5—the Water Lily. Turn the corners over, and tuck them in at c and d. Turn back the second fold at the top—fig. 6. Napkin Folded for small '1 arts at the side and a Cake in the middle.—Have a perfectly square napkin ; turn the corners over so that they meet at the centre. Turn the four corners back to the edge, and you will have figure 7 ; carefully turn the napkin without unfolding it ; turn it over from two opposite sides into the centre at figure 8 ; turn it over again and make the other two ends meet in the middle you have then figure 9.

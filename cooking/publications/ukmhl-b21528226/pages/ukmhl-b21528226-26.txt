^6 K itchcn Utcnsils. Omelet-pan, with sloping sides. Saurt-pan (see Sautd-ing). Captain Warren's Bachelor's Frying-pan, closed. Bachelor's Frying-pan, open. - This frying-pan, invented by Captain Warren, is, we think, preferable to the or- dinary frying-pan. It retains the heat better from being fluted instead of plain, and renders it unnecessary to touch the Trussing Needle, for trussing poultry, steak with the beef tongs. It shuts (as shown in the engraving) over the steak or chop, and can be turned over from one side to the other, as the cook pleases, till the meat is dressed. Meat Saw, for sawing bones in parts of meat where the chopper cannot be used. Lrrding Needle, made with split ends, like a cleft stick, to receive strips of fat bacon, which by its means are grafted into the flesh of turkeys, poultrv, &c.

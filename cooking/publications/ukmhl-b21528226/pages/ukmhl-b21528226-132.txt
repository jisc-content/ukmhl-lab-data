118 Baked and Boiled Puddings. Queen Mabâ€™s Pudding. Time, half an hour. 554- One pint and a half of cream, or a pint of milk and half a pint of cream ; peel Of one lemon; six bitter almonds; one ounce of isinglass ; five ounces of sugar ; yolks of six eggs ; two ounaes and a half of dried cherries ; three ounces of preserved ginger ; two ounces of candied orange peel ; one ounce of pistachio-nuts. Blanch and bruise about six bitter almonds, cut the peel of a lemon very thin, and put both into a clean stewpan with a pint of milk; stir it at the side of the fire until it is at the point of boiling, and the flavour of the lemon and almonds is well drawn out. Then add an ounce of isinglass, and a very little salt. When, the isinglass is dissolved, strain the milk through muslin into another stewpan, and add the sugar broken, and the cream ; just allow it to boil, then stir quickly in the yolks of the eggs well- beaten, and stir it constantly and carefully to prevent its curdling, until it becomes of the thickness of a good custard ; then pour it out, and again stir it until nearly cold ; then mix with it the dried cherries, and the citron cut into shreds. Rub a drop of oil over a mould, pour in the mixture, and set it in a cold place or on ice, for some time before it is turned out. Preserved ginger may be substituted forthe dried cherries, and pistachio-nuts blanched and cut for the candied citron, with the syrup of the ginger poured round it; currants may also take the place of the cherries, but they must be steamed for a quarter of an hour before they are used ; and a sauce of sweetened raspberry, strawberry, or any other juice of fresh fruit may be served as sauce instead of the ginger syrup [see coloured plate).

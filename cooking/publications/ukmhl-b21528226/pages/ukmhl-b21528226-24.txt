'4 K itchen Utonsils. Saucepan Digester. Stcwpan Digester. The Patent "Digester ‚Äù cannot be too warmly recommended to those who have need to practise economy. The mode of using it is simple and easy. Care must be taken in filling a digester to leave room enough for the steam to pass off through the valve at the top of the cover. This may be done by filling the digester only three-parts full of water and bruised bones or meat, which it is to be noticed are all to be put in together. It must then be placed near a slow fire, so as only to simmer (more heat injures the quality), and this it must do for the space of eight or ten hours. After this has been done, the soup is to be strained through a hair sieve or colander, in order to separate any bits of bones. The soup is then to be put into the digester again, and afterwards whatever vegetables, spices, &c., are thought necessary are added, the whole is to be well boiled together for an hour or two, and it will be then fit for immediate use. In putting on the lid of the digester, take care that a mark, thus (X) on the lid, is opposite to a similar one on the digester. The digester may also be obtained to con- tain from four quarts to ten gallons. The saucepan and stewpan digesters hold from one to eight quarts. Salmon or Jack Kettle. Turbot Kettle. Fish Kettle.

Ingredients.—A round of beef, 4 gallons of water, 41b^ of coarse brown sugar, 2oz. of saltpetre, 61bs. of bay salt. Boil all these ingredients till quite clear or while a scum rises. Let it lie for 24 hours, when you may put the beef into the vessel you intend to keep it in, and pour the liquor over it till it be quite covered, and in this condition it must be kept. If the meat is to be preserved a considerable time it will be necessary to boil the pickle over again, once in, two months removing all scum as it rises, and throwing in whilst boiling 2oz. of sugar and Ub. of common salt.

PREFACE. In adding yet another Cookery Book to the multitude already in circulation, I have two objects, firstly, the recipes, all of which have been tested, and are the result of many years practical knowledge, are no common ones, and will, I venture to think, prove a welcome addition to those already well kuown in most households ; secondly, it has been my aim to present them to the reader in such a way that the merest novice, by carefully following the instructions given with each, may rest assured of success. The collection is not taken from any published flource, but derived from manuscripts in my posses- sion, comprising what is best in old English, Scotch, and Irish Cookery; the French recipes were collected by a celebrated French chef, at the time when the Tuillieries was the scene of all that was bright and gay, and were given to Lady C , in whose service he subsequently lived, she in turn handing them down to my grandmother.

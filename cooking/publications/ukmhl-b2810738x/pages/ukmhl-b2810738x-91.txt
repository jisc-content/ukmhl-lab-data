layer of forcemeat (see below) about an inch, thick, on this lay the fillets of tongue, cheek, truffles, and here and there the pistachio nuts. Cover these with another layer of forcemeat and proceed as before till the head is sufficiently garnished. Season with pepper and salt, and if liked a dust of nutmeg. Now wrap the head up in a strong cloth pre- viously well buttered, and sew it well up to preserve its shape. Put it into a braizing pan with the vegetables sliced, meat and game trimmings, calf’s feet and cover with stock Set the braising pan on the fire and simmer gently for 5 hours. As soon as it boils skim thoroughly. Take out the head and carefully tighten the cloth to preserve its shape Put it back into its braise and let it remain till cool. Now put it into a deep braising dish in the oven for a few minutes. Take it out, carefully remove the cloth and glaze the head over with dark coloured glaze. It can be orna- mented with Italian paste or lard piped on, and should be sent to table garnished with aspic jelly. FORCEMEAT FOR ABOVE. Ingredients.—lib. of veal, lib. of fat bacon 4 chopped mushrooms, ^ a teaspoonful chopped parsley, pepper and salt and the yolks of 3 eggs. Chop these ingredients very fine. Pound well in a mortar with the eggs, work all thoroughly together and the force- meat will be ready for use. GLAZE. Ingredients.—Rich stock, omitting celery and turnips. Put the stock into a stewpan over the fire and let it boil till it somewhat stiffens, then keep stirring carefully to pre- vent it burning. When it is sufficiently reduced and comes to a glaze turn it into a glaze pot and proceed to glaze the boars head with it. Where dark glaze is required more beef aDd less veal should be used and vice versa.

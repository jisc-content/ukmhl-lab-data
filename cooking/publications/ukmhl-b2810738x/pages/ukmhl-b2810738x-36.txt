32 Shell the walnuts, throw them into boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes to remove the skins, then put them into a mortar and pound them with a little of the stock, which should be cool. Pound them till they are perfectly smooth, adding by degrees a little more stock till the whole is used and the puree is thoroughly mixed. When this is done strain the mixture through a sieve into an enamelled sauce- pan* put it on the- fire stirring all the time till quite hot, then pour in the cream, mix, season with salt, and serve directly with fried croutons. If the puree be too thick more stock must be added, it being impossible to give exact proportions as walnuts vary so much in size.

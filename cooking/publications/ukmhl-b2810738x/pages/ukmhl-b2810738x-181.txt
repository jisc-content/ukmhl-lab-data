177 SWEETS. COMPOTE OF APPLES.—COMPOTE DE POMMES A LA FRANCAISE. Ingredients.—Apples, J a pint of water, | a pint of white wine, lib. of lump sugar, 2 sliced lemons, a little cinnamon. Peel the apples very thin and even and put them into water. Now put the peelings into a stewpan with the water, wine, sugar, lemon, cinnamon, and pippins. Set the pan on the stove and let the contents boil very slowly for 1 hour. When this is done strain the syrup from the apples through a very fine sieve. Lay the apples evenly round a preserving pan (not one upon another) pour the syrup over them and simmer very gently until they are quite tender. Now take the apples up with a slice and put them on a dish to cool. Reduce the syrup to the amount suffi- cient to cover the apples and garnish with sliced preserved oranges when quite cold. Placed on ice for a few minutes this dish is best. ALMOND CHEESECAKES.

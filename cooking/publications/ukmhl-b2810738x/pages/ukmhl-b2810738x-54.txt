Ingredients.—A turtle, 121bs. lean gravy beef, 2 bottles Madeira wine, |oz. of mace, Joz. of nutmeg, a dust of cayenne, black pepper, and salt to taste, 6 shallots, a bouquet of sweet herbs, crumb of 2 French rolls, yolks of 4 eggs. 1 pint of ketchup, forcemeat, butter. Cut the head off, tie it up by the hind fins and let it hang 2 hours. Separate the calapee (the lower shield of the turtle) from the calipash (the upper shield). Take out the entrails, split them, and when scoured perfectly dry, clean them with salt and water. Now cut off the fins close to the calapee, and cut all the meat close to the skull. Now cut the calapee and calipash into 6 or 8 pieces, lay them and the fins in boiling water for 2 minutes, then dry them for blanching as you would an ox palate. Now boil the meat for 6 minutes and let the calapee, calipash, and fins simmer till they are perfectly tender, and when half done bone the calipee and calipash. Boil the entrails till they are as tender as the skin of a calf’s head. When all this is done lay the pieces on dishes for 1 day. Then make the beef into good gravy and add to it the wine, mace, nutmeg, shallots, sweet herbs, and seasoning, bread crumbs and eggs. Cut the calapee, calapash, fins, and entrails into neat pieces (as for a ragout) lay them in a large pan. Into this pour the seasoned gravy, mix well together and pom* the prepared turtle and gravy into a large dish. Cover with veal force- meat, butter, and yolks of hard boiled egg and bake for the tune you would any other large meat dish.

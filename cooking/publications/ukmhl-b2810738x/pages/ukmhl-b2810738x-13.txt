SOUPS. AUSTRIAN SOUP—POTAGE AUTRICHIEN. Ingredients.—Liquor in which, a piece of beef has been boiled, 4oz. of butter, |lb. calf’s liver, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 onions, 1 head of celery, a little parsley, 2 tomatoes, pep- per, and salt. Chop up all the vegetables, and put them to the butter, melted in a saucepan over the fire, toss them about till they are well browned, then add the liver finely minced, the beef liquor (or common stock), and set all to simmer gently for 6 hours. When required strain through a hair sieve and then through a fine napkin, as neither the liver or vegetables are served in this soup. ASPARAGUS SOUP.—PUREE D’ASPERGES. Ingredients.—31b. of asparagus, 6 pints of white stock, 4 leeks, 2 onions, a bunch of herbs, 4oz. fresh butter, 5 tablespoonfuls of fine flour, 1^ pints of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs, 2 drops of lemon juice. Cut off the green tops from the asparagus, and put them aside, then chop up finely the white part of the leeks, onions, and herbs. Now put the asparagus stalks, leeks, onions, and herbs into a saucepan with the butter, and fry altogether for 20 minutes, add the flour, mix well together, then put in the stock. Let all simmer gently for about an hour till the vegetables are quite tender, removing from time to time carefully any scum that rises. When this is done, strain off the liquor from the vegetables, these should then be pounded, and the stock added to the pulp, and the whole rubbed through a fine sieve. Warm the puree, add the cream previously made hot, and at the very last stir in the eggs and lemon juice, add the asparagus points, which have been boiled until quite tender, and serve very hot. This soup looks very pretty coloured a very pale green with a little spinach colouring.

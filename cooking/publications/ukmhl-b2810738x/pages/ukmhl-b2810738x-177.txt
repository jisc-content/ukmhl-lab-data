173 Boil the butter, sugar, water and half the rind of the lemon together. Drop a. little into cold water and if crisp it is done. When the boiling has ceased stir in the juice of the lemon. Blanch the almonds, halve them, and lay flat side downwards on a buttered tin which should be shal- low. When cold the toffee will be easily removed from the tin. When the almonds and lemon are omitted a little vanilla flavouring is very nice. WEDDING CAKE.

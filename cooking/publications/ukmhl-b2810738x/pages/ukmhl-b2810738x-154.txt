150 CONTINENTAL SALAD. GENUINE GERMAN RECIPE. Mince equal proportions of cold roast veal, raw herring,, apple, cucumber, hard boiled egg and mixed pickles. Mu with shred lettuce and a little vinegar. ENDIVE SALAD.—SALADE DE CHICOREE. Ingredients.—2 heads of endive, French salad sauce. Thoroughly wash and clean the endive, and free it from its outside leaves. Mix it well with French salad sauce to which may be added when liked, a very little finely chopped onion. LETTUCE SALAD.—SALADE DE LAITUE. Lettuce salad can be dressed with either French, English, or mayonnaise sauce, and can be made entirely of lettuce or mixed with beetroot, watercress, tomato and mustard and cress. In making salads bear in mind that to be a success the vegetables used must be perfectly dry, in order to achieve this squeeze them in a hot clean napkin till all mois- ture is extracted. Never cut lettuce but tear it in pieces with the fingers. Finally never pom’ the sauce over the salad till just required to serve, as if the salad is left long in the sauce it will lose all its crispness. ITALIAN SALAD.—SALADE IT ALIENEE. Ingredients.—1 or 2 heads of cauliflower, an equal quan- tity, when in season, of asparagus points, ditto of French beans, \ a pint of green peas, 3 artichoke bottoms, a few new potatoes, some young carrots, seasoning of tarragon, and chervil, tartar or mayonnaise sauce. When all the vegetables are boiled and coldj cut them up in any pretty fancy shape with a vegetable cutter, the caidi- flower should be cut up in small tufts. Season the vege- tables with a litle tarragon, chervil, oil, and vinegar. Put the vegetables in a glass salad bowl and mix with a suffi- cient quantity of sauce, serve very cold.

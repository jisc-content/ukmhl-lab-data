'19 POULTRY AND GAME. CHRISTMAS PIE. FAMOUS OLD IRISH RECIPE. Ingredients.â€”2 geese, 2 turkeys, 21bs. raw and peeled truffles, 31bs. prime ham, fillet of veal, farce, bacon, 1 pint of stock, seasoning of pepper, salt, and fine spice. Bone the geese and turkeys and season them inside, then put them away in a cold larder for 3 days. Now draw the geese one within the other, and put some rich farce in the middle with about 6 truffles, and then tie the geese up into good shape. Prepare the turkeys in the same manner add- ing the ham which should have been previously braised for 2 hours and tie them up the same shape as the geese. Put the stock into a braising pan only just large enough to hold the birds, and put it on to a slow stove to simmer very gently for \ an hour. When this is done leave the birds to < ool in the pan. While they are cooling make a raised pie (according to previous recipes), and be sure the geese and turkey are quite cold before you put them into the pie. Cover the bottom of the pie with slices of veal, cover these with a layer of farce, then put in the birds, put farce between them and all round the sides of the pie, then add the remainder of the truffles and cover them with slices of bacon. Cover the pie with pastry and ornament it according to fancy. Next day put it into the oven for about 8 houis (one from which the bread has just been drawn is the best), and leave it for 24 hours to get thoroughly cold. A pie like this should be prepared 4 or 5 days before it is required. When ready to send to table, carefully remove the top, lake away the slices of bacon, cover with chopped aspic and ser ve. Where the pie is to be kept for some time the following stock will be found a better method than the aspic which is liable to tuna sour.

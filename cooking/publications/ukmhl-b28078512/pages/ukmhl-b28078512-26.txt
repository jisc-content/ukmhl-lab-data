SOUPS A LA MODE. 14 wine, when the soup should be made hot again. Two or three kinds of game may be mixed in the same soup. Soup de Galles. Potage a la Galles. Take a pigâ€™s-head, set aside the cheeks, which may be cured ; partly boil the rest; then cut up the meat into neat square pieces, and put the bones to stew in three quarts of second stock, well flavoured with vegetables, sweet herbs, pepper and salt; then strain and set by to cool. The next day take off all the fat from the stock, heat it in a stewpan, thicken with flour and butter, and add the pieces of meat with forcemeat and egg-balls. The meat should be first simmered in the stock for a quarter of an hour before the forcemeat balls are added, and the egg-balls should only be put in just before sending to table. Make the forcemeat balls of finely chopped suet, bread crumbs, a little veal and ham or tongue, finely chopped sweet herbs, pepper and salt; bind all together with a little yolk of egg, make up into small balls with a sprinkle of flour, and boil them well for a few minutes before putting into the soup. For the egg-balls take the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs and half the yolk of a raw egg, mix together, rub through a wire sieve, make into a paste with a sprinkle of flour, form into small balls, and boil two or three minutes in water. Flavour the soup with a little mushroom ketchup or Old English sauce, a squeeze of lemon, and a little .sherry or Marsala.

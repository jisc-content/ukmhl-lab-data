SOUPS A LA MODE. 34 from the bone and the fat from the meat; break the bones in half and take out all the marrow from them, the marrow being put aside for other purposes. Put the meat and bones into a stockpot and pour in five pints of cold water ; put in a teaspoon- ful of salt to assist the scum to rise, place the stockpot on the fire with the lid on, and let it come to the boil quickly. Skim the scum off constantly, then draw the stockpot rather to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for five or six hours. Now scrape two young carrots, peel a turnip and cut it into slices, take half a head of celery, one leek and one onion ; wash them well and cut them in squares. Take one cauliflower, wash it in cold water and squeeze it dry in a cloth, cut off all the green leaves and the stalk, and pull the flower into sprigs ; watch and skim the soup, and add now and then a little cold water to make the scum rise. One hour before serving the soup the vegetables are added, putting in the carrots, celery, and leek first. In half an hour add turnip, and a quarter of an hour after that the flower of the cauliflower. Take a saucepan full of hot water and put it on the fire to boil, and when the water quite boils put in a quarter pint of shelled peas, a teaspoonful of salt, and a pinch of carbonate of soda, and let all boil with the cover of the saucepan off from fifteen to twenty minutes. Now feel if the peas are soft; take them out and drain them in a colander, and put them into the hot soup tureen, and ladle the soup and other vegetables from the stockpot to the tureen. A piece of sugar in the soup is a great improvement.

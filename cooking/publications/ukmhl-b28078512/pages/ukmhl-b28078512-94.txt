82 DRESSED FISH A LA MODE, fish, a bay-leaf, and a finely-minced shalot, pepper, salt, and a little lemon-juice. When the sauce is properly flavoured, strain it and add the fish minced very fine. Tartare Sauce. Take two eggs, and put the yolks in one basin and the whites into another; take a wooden spoon and stir the yolks enough to break them ; add a saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful of French vinegar. Take a bottle of salad oil, and pour in drop by drop a gill of it. Then add a teaspoonful more vinegar, and a few drops of tarragon vinegar. Then take a small bunch of parsley and put it in a small sauce- pan of boiling water, with a little salt and soda, for two or three seconds ; then dry it thoroughly by squeezing it in a cloth ; chop it up finely to make a teaspoonful. Take a few gherkins or capers, and chop them up finely enough to make a tablespoon- ful. Put all these into the sauce and mix in with a spoon. Sauce a la Trois Freres. Mince half a dozen mushrooms, half a dozen onions, and a clove of garlic. Put the mushrooms into a saucepan, pour over them as much stock as will cover them, and simmer gently till the sauce is pleasantly flavoured. Strain the liquor through a tammy, add a glass of claret, boil up once more, and serve. A few drops of anchovy essence is an improvement.

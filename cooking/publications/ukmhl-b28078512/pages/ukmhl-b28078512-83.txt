DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. 71 ful of lemon-juice or chili vinegar, a teaspoon- ful of essence of anchovy and a dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup. Strain over the fish and serve very hot. Turban of Trout. Turban de Truite. Take the fillets of two small trout, flatten them and trim and cut them so that they will fit the mould, which should be a plain round one ; season them with a little salt, and well sprinkle half of them on one side with lobster spawn (if lobster spawn is not procurable, sprinkle with chopped parsley). Butter the mould and line it with buttered paper; arrange the fillets of trout alter- nately round the mould like Savoy cakes in a Charlotte Russe mould, put over these a lobster farce ; smooth this well inside with a broad knife dipped into hot water, and press the farce well on to the fillets. Fill up the centre with some cucumber cut into slices and cooked in sauce. Place some more farce on the top and smooth it again; place the mould in a stewpan with sufficient boiling water to come half-way up the mould. When the water reboils, draw the pan to the side of the stove and put the lid on, and let it steam for nearly an hour ; when ready, turn out the dish, pour the sauce round, and garnish the top of the turban with quenelles of lobster farce and sliced pieces of cucumber cut in the shape of peas round the base. The sauce for this should be made of the fish bones, an onion, a sprig of thyme, a small bay-leaf, a little salt and pepper boiled up in cold water, and when brought to the boil skim and let it boil

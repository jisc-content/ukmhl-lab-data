58 DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. Boiled Salt Fish a la Moderne. Morue bouillie a la Moderne. Soak the fish in cold water for thirty-six hours, changing the water four times. Put the fish to soak flesh downwards. This done, cut the fish into neat fillets, and boil them slowly in milk and water, skimming carefully. When cooked, arrange the fillets in a circle round the dish; mask each fillet with egg sauce; fill up the centre with egg sauce ; and garnish round the fillets with a wreath of parsnips which have been boiled in butter and water, and then cut into very thin strips of two inches long. Tammy a hard boiled yolk of egg, and sprinkle it all over the parsnips, and sprinkle a little finely-chopped parsley in little tufts here and there over all ; garnish with egg balls and quarters of lemon. A puree of parsnips made with cream can be handed with it, or egg sauce flavoured with lemon. Sole ^ Iâ€™Aurore. Butter a tin dish and lay on it a sole, covering it with buttered paper ; place it for ten minutes in the oven, take it out and carefully remove the centre bone, strew a little chopped onion and parsley, and replace the upper fillets and pour over a white sauce and return it to the oven. Boil some eggs hard, take the white and cut in fancy shapes, and pass the yolks through a sieve and sprinkle over the top of the fish ; garnish the side with the fancy shapes of the white.

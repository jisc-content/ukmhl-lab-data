15 SOUPS A LA MODE. Giblet Soup. Potage de Gibelettes. Take two sets of goose or four sets of duckâ€™s giblets, scald and skin the claws, ends of legs, &c., and wash them clean in cold water, and then put them into boiling water for five minutes to blanch. Then throw them into cold water and wash and scrape them clean, then cut the giblets into pieces about one and a half inches long and place them in a stewpan. Then take one-quarter head of celery, one carrot, one turnip, two onions and a shalot; wash all these well and scrape and peel them; put these into stewpan with the giblets, and add two cloves, a bouquet garni, and a bay-leaf. Pour in two quarts of second white stock, and let it boil gently for two hours, skimming occasionally. Then take out the best pieces of the giblets and trim them neatly and put them aside, leaving the stewpan on the fire to boil for half an hour; take another stew- pan, and put in one and a half ounce of butter and one ounce of flour, and let them fry for a few minutes, stirring well with a wooden spoon ; now add the stock and stir well till it boils. Remove the stewpan to the side of the fire and let it simmer for twenty minutes, the cover of the saucepan being only half on. Then skim off all the grease which will have arisen to the top, and strain the soup into a basin, adding one quarter-pint of Marsala, sherry or claret, a dessertspoonful of lemon juice, a grain of cayenne, and salt to taste. Put the giblets that were set aside into the tureen, and pour the soup over it.

DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. 43 slices of hard-boiled eggs, and a fillet or two of anchovies cut up into dice. When all the fish is thus arranged in the mould, pour the jelly in very gently, a tablespoonful at a time, in order not to disturb the solid material. Let the mould stand on ice (or in cold water for seven or eight hours), when it can be turned out. Ornament with parsley, lemon, and beetroot. Matelote of Eels. Anguilles en Matelote. Take a couple of skinned eels, cut into pieces, dip in flour, and fry them a light brown in butter. Melt four ounces of butter, mixing with it a table- spoonful of flour ; add half a pint of stock and the same quantity of Burgundy, a small bundle of herbs, two shalots, pepper, salt, and cloves to taste. Boil this sauce for a quarter of an hour, strain it over the eels in a saucepan with a few button mushrooms, and let the whole stew gently for half an hour. Squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, and serve very hot. Eel Pout a I’ltalienne. Lottes a I’ltalienne. Fry the eel pout and dish them up covered with the following sauce. Take a small parsnip, a young carrot, two sliced onions, a bead of garlic, a bay-leaf, and three cloves ; warm in butter, and moisten with three-quarters of a pint of champagne and a little stock ; simmer for an hour, pass through a tammy, skim off all grease, and reduce the sauce if too thin. Season with a pounded anchovy, some chopped capers, salt, and black pepper.

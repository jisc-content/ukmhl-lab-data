G LACES—ICES. In French cookery or confectionery language the word glace has a threefold meaning: anything coated or masked with meat glaze, sugar, or syrup, is called glace; but the course known as glaces in this instance refers to sweet juices, creams, or other sweet mix- tures, which are by means of artificial freezing rendered into semi-liquid or solid ice. There are several varieties of ices; those known as cream and water ices are the most popular; whilst Souffles, Mousses, Par/aits, Sorbets, Bombes, Poudings glaces, and Ponding souffles, being somewhat more complicated, are termed compound ices, or iced pre- parations.

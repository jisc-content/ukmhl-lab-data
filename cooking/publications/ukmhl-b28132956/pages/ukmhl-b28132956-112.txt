ENTREES 7« dishes.” A dish bearing the name “entree” is always composed of more than one ingredient, and should be distinguished from meat served only with a garnish. When two entrees are chosen in a dinner, the first should be the lighter of the two. All entrees should be made in fancy style, so as to avoid carving; for entrees are never carved or served from the side- board. Dishes known as fish entrees, excepting in the case of cold dishes, are allowable as entrees during Lent. The great secret in entrees in general lies undoubt- edly in the sauces used for their preparation or their accompaniment. As sauces, or as liquid seasonings, they must be rich and carefully prepared. Compound or long process sauces, foundation sauces and their offsprings, play a most important part in the entrees themselves, as well as in their relation to the dishes which precede and follow them.

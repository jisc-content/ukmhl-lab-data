168 ROAST [ROTI) game is roasted (cooked) before the fire on the spit, or else in the oven, and is served with a nicely flavoured rich gravy. When a remove (joint) is served, the Roast consists of birds, game, or poultry. When game is out of season, capons, poularde, turkey, duckling, duck, pigeon, guinea fowl, etc., etc., are served instead. Game and poultry should be accompanied with the necessary bread sauce, brown (fried) breadcrumbs, croutes of bread, garnished with watercress, chipped or other fried potatoes, and a seasonable salad also forms a usual accompaniment with roast birds. Roast joints are not again mentioned here, because these have already been exhaustively treated in the chapter headed Releve. De la Volaille—Poultry. Canard roti. Campines rotis. Canetons votis.

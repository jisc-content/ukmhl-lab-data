Sorbets, Granites, Roman Punch, and similar preparations, are ices in a semi-liquid state ; they are never moulded, but are served in goblet, stem, or punch glasses, immediately before the roast, the object being to refresh the palate and to prepare the guest for the more perfect enjoyment of the succeeding dishes, viz., the roast and the entremets. Although served separately, the punch or sorbet should not be given an extra heading on the menu, but be simply placed on a line distinct from the other courses. There are close on a hundred varieties of these preparations, the most popular of which are listed below. SOPbet aux fpaises (Strawberry Sorbet).—Straw- berry water ice half frozen, flavoured witn sauterne and Curasao.

23 SOUPER ET MENUS DES SOUPERS. SUPPER AND SUPPER BILLS OF FARE. This is the term for the last meal of the day, and one which has a wide and varied meaning. During the Middle Ages supper used to be served as early as 5 p.m., when it was customary to serve soup ; from this the name supper is supposed to have originated. History tells ps that soups, or supper dishes, originally consisted of liquid food both savoury and sweet, such as fumity, porridge, and various kinds of spoon meat, which were eaten with pieces of bread called sops, soppets, or sippets. Where late dinner is served, as is usually the case at the present time, supper is rarely eaten. So-called ball suppers and theatre suppers are fashionable both here and abroad. There is no set rule as to the kind of dishes served for supper, but when partaken of as an every-day meal supper may consist of dishes hot or cold, with or without soups, vegetables, or even sweets. Cheese and salad when in season are usually included, but this is not to be regarded as a hard- and-fast rule. Light cakes and fancy gateaux, tea or coffee, are sometimes included in a supper menu, which shows that many regard this meal as but a light repast. The following menus are selected as specimens for so-termed set suppers; SPECIMEN MENUS FOR SUPPERS. MENUS DES SOUPERS. French.

ADVERTISEMENTS ix ALWAYS ORDER LIEBIG AS WARNING: It is not generally known that there are more than a dozen inferior imitations of the genuine Liebig Company’s Extract (Lemco). But the only extract with which the celebrated Justus von Liebig was ever connected and to which he gave his name is LIEBIG COMPANY’S EXTRACT, made by Liebig’s Extract of Meat Company, whose initials—L E M C O —mark the only genuine brand to protect you from inferior substitutes.

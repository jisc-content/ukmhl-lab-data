PEPTONISED OYSTERS 97 form adapted to ready digestion in the stomach. Be sure to boil the peptonised beef after it has stood three hours in a warm place, otherwise the digestion will proceed until the meat is spoiled. The process above given for peptonisation of beef will do equally well for other kinds of meat, such as mutton, veal, lamb, fowl, game, etc. Peptonised Oysters. (ORIGINALLY SUGGESTED BY DR. N. A. RANDOLPH.) Take six large oysters with their juice and half a pint of water; heat in a saucepan until they have boiled briskly for a few minutes. Mince the oysters finely, and reduce them to a paste with a potato- masher in a wooden bowl; now put the oysters in a glass jar with the broth which has been set aside, and add 'zymine' three measures (15 grains), and bicarbonate of soda one measure (15 grains). Let the jar stand in hot water or a warm place where the temperature is not above 115Â° F. for one and a half hours, then pour into a saucepan, and add half a pint of milk; heat over the fire slowly to boiling-point, flavour with salt and pepper, or condiments to taste, and serve very hot. There will be found but very small pieces of the oysters undigested, and these may be strained out or rejected in eating the soup, tut will not prove disturbing to the stomach except in very rare cases. The milk will be sufficiently digested during the few minutes which will elapse before the mixture boils, if heated gradually. Be sure to boil the peptonised oysters to finish the process. 7

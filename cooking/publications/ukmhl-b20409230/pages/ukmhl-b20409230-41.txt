ROASTING OR BAKING MEAT 31 lower animals, especially in sheep, is found generally in the kidneys and liver, and they therefore require to be cooked long enough for the heat to penetrate to the interior and destroy the microbes. In a fresh tongue the fibres of the flesh are small and delicate, and if slowly cooked are very digestible (see recipe), but pickling hardens the fibres. The flesh of birds contains very little fat; this deficiency therefore must be made up : in roasting by the use of butter or lard, and in boiling by serving melted butter or bacon with them. The flesh of fowls, pheasant, partridge, turkey, pigeon, guinea-hen, etc., is nutritious and easily digested. Those birds whose flesh contains some fat, and whose muscular fibre is closer—such as geese, ducks, teal, etc.—are far more difficult to digest. Rabbits are a light food, and more digestible than hares, but not so nutritious; in both these cases the want of fat should be supplied by serving with bacon or pickled pork. Roasting or Baking Meat. Our first care in roasting or baking a joint of meat must be to form a coating of solidified albumen on the outside of it; this is to seal up and keep in the nutritious juices, and so prevent as far as possible their escape, and the consequent loss of nourish- ment. To do this we must give the joint great heat on all sides for the first ten minutes; then the albumen on the outside will be coagulated by the heat, and form a crust or coating. But if this great heat were

26 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY Fried Fillets of Sole. i sole. i egg. Breadcrumbs. Flour. Parsley. Frying fat. Remove the dark skin and fillet the sole; a moderate-sized sole will make four large or eight small fillets. Wash, dry, and rub them with a little flour ; cover them well with egg and breadcrumbs. Fry in smoking-hot fat, sufficient to cover them, for ten minutes, unless the fillets are very thick. Drain well on soft paper ; decorate with fried parsley. If liked, the fillets can be saturated in lemon-juice for half an hour, and then well dried before covering with the egg and crumbs. Filleted Sole aux Crevettes. i large sole, filleted. i gill of shrimps (picked and pounded). Pepper and salt to taste. A little butter. Divide the sole into eight fillets; dry them well; sprinkle them with pepper and salt; cover with the pounded shrimps. Roll each fillet up, and put side by side in a pie-dish. Put a small piece of butter on each, and, if liked, a squeeze of lemon-juice; cover with buttered paper or a dish. Bake in a moderate oven from twenty to thirty minutes. Serve with fish-sauce (No. 2) poured over. Garnish with finely- chopped parsley and hard-boiled yolk of egg. Sole stewed in Milk. 1 sole. Salt. New milk.

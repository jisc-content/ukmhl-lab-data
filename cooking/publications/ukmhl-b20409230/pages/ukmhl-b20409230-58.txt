Wash the palates and put them into a stewpan, with hot water to cover them; boil gently, until the skin is tender and can easily be removed. Then skin the palates, and cut them into six pieces. Melt the butter or dripping in a stewpan, and when quite hot add the vegetables, prepared and cut into small pieces ; fry a nice brown. Then add the stock, herbs, cloves, curry-powder, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper. When it boils, put in the palates ; simmer very gently for four hours, or until they are quite tender. Then take out the palates, skim off every particle of fat, thicken the gravy with one table- spoonful of flour mixed smoothly with a little cold water; stir until it boils, and add one wineglassful of port wine.

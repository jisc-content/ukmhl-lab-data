MILK, EGGS, BUTTER, CHEESE—FRUIT 63 is highly nourishing; but when rancid or cooked (as in pastry, cakes, sauces, hot buttered toast, etc.) it often proves exceedingly indigestible. Cheese contains large proportions of nitrogenous substances—tv/ice as much, weight for weight, as meat. The richer, softer kinds, if taken in modera- tion, have been proved not difficult to digest; indeed, some physicians advocate a small piece after dinner to help in digesting the other food by its stimulating action on the stomach. The poor, hard kinds of cheese contain a large proportion of caseine, and are therefore difficult to digest. Eggs are almost a perfect food, only wanting in mineral salts, which are found chiefly in the shell. They are a highly-nutritious food in a concentrated form. If taken raw or lightly cooked, they are easily digested, but boiled hard or fried, are most difficult to digest. Poaching or steaming (see recipes) are the two lightest modes of cooking eggs. Many people who for years have been unable to digest eggs boiled in the usual manner, for three and a half minutes, can do so easily when they are served steamed. Owing to the gentle heat in steaming, the albumen (or white) never becomes hard or tough, but is softly solid. Fruit. Fruit contains very little nutritive matter, and, when fresh, much water, the latter making the juicy sorts very valuable in hot weather as substitutes for alcoholic drinks or doubtful water. The value of fruit is due to the anti-scorbutic and aperient pro-

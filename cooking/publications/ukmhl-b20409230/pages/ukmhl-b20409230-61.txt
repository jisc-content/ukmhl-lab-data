VEGETABLES 5l also contain a large amount of water, often as much as 90 per cent., but the nitrogenous substance is very small. The digestibility, and therefore greater value as food, of many vegetables is largely increased by cultivation. .Spinach, when freed from grit, properly cooked, and rubbed through a sieve, is very whole- some, and as it acts as an aperient, is frequently ordered for constipation. Cauliflowers are most digestible and delicate, also seakale. Onions are used as a condiment as well as a vegetable, and contain a large amount of albumenoid matter; they are slightly laxative, and frequently ordered in kidney complaints. If onions are parboiled or scalded before being cooked, they lose a great deal of their strong oil, and so are much more easily digested. Tomatoes are refreshing and wholesome, but, on account of their containing oxalic acid, are seldom allowed where there is a tendency to gout or rheumatism. Vegetable-marrows are of little value as food, owing to the large quantity of water they con- tain, but are light and easily digested. Steaming is the best mode of cooking them, because their full flavour is retained, and no foreign water introduced. Asparagus is easy of digestion, and is thought by some medical men to act as a sedative in cardiac palpitations. Cabbages, brussels sprouts, greens, etc., contain a large amount of sulphur, and therefore cause flatulence to some people. The best way to free these vegetables from insects is to put them into a large dry basin and pour boiling water over them ; this not only kills the insects (the old plan of soaking 4â€”2

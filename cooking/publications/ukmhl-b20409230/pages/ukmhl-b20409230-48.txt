THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY Stewed Chop and Rice. 1 chump chop. 2 oz. rice. Pepper and salt. i bunch of parsley or sweet herbs. £ pint boiling water. Trim the chop ; put it into a small saucepan, with the pepper and salt, and the parsley and herbs tied in a bunch, so that they can be easily lifted out when dishing. Pour over the boiling water, add the rice well washed and picked over. Simmer very gently one and a half hours, taking great care the rice does not stick and burn, and adding more water if neces- sary ; but the stew should be quite thick with rice when done. For serving, put the chop on a hot dish, take out the parsley or herbs, and pour the rice and gravy round. This is a most nourishing dish for an invalid, any nutriment that comes from the chop being mixed with the rice and gravy. Pepper in any of these recipes can be omitted, if not allowed. Baked Sweetbreads. S lambs' sweetbreads. 2 oz. butter „„„ Breadcrumbs. Trim the sweetbreads, and soak them in cold water for three hours; then put them into boiling water or stock, and simmer gently for half an hour. Drain them until dry ; cover with egg and crumbs. Place them on a tin, pour over them the butter (melted), and bake in a moderate oven for about an hour, basting frequently. If the sweetbreads are small, half an hour will be sufficient. Serve garnished with cut lemon.

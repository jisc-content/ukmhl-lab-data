62 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY commenced by a change which takes place in the starch, converting it into sugar. A little butter in the water also helps to soften them whilst cooking. If they are to be cooked for soup or stews, put them into cold water to extract the nutriment, but if for vegetables into boiling water. Milk, Eggs, Butter, Cheese. Milk is a perfect food, not only containing all that is necessary to sustain life in the young, but doing so in the right proportions. For adults it requires to be mixed with other foods to obtain the right amount of nourishment. Milk is best heated slowly; if allowed to boil fast, the albumen hardens and be- comes indigestible. It also burns very quickly if the saucepan is not perfectly clean. One of the simplest and best ways of heating milk is to place it in a jug standing in a saucepan of cold water, which should be allowed to come to the boil very slowly. The milk should be stirred occasionally to prevent the albumen forming a skin on the top. Milk heated in this way is rich and creamy.

Butter is one of the most digestible, delicate, and agreeable in flavour of animal fats, and

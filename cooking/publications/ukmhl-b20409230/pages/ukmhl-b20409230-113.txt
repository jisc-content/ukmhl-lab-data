A NURSING NOTE 103 as in other things. It is a good plan to heat a little teapot, and to pour into it the tea made in another one, as doctors often prohibit ' tea that has stood.' In any case the plates should fit comfortably into the tray, and yet not absolutely like the pieces of a dis- sected map ; and if there is room for a specimen glass holding a fresh rose or other flower, sent perhaps by some loving friend, we may be sure it will be greeted with a smile, and the morning tea after the weary night will seem all the better. In sickness the un- expected does not lose its power of giving pleasure. It may be permitted, too, in a note of this sort to plead for variety of food. Its importance is now understood in preparing meals for those in health; but in sickness it is even of greater value. Let the nurse then obtain for her patient all the variety that is consistent with the limitations of the case, re- membering that even the change in the colouring of a dish is not an insignificant one, and will often induce a patient to eat. In a monotonous and suffering life a change which seems trifling to outsiders is very real to the prisoner within four walls. To move the sofa to a slightly different position, to change the picture opposite the bed from time to time, to bring in some unexpected flowers or fruitâ€”none of these things are beneath the attention of the nurse on whom the wellbeing and restoration of the patient depends, and whose power, like that of genius, lies in ' an infinite capacity for taking pains.'

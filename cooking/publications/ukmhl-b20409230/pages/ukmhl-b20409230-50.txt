Cut off all the meat from the bones, and put them into a saucepan with half a pint cold water and a little salt; boil until reduced to half. Cut the lean part of the meat into strips ; roll them up. Mix the seasoning on a plate, and dip the rolls into it; place them in a pie-dish, and pour over them the boiling stock made from the bones ; let them stand to cool whilst making the crust. Prepare the crust, and cut off one third for the cover; roll out the remainder, and line a well-greased pint basin with it. Beard the oysters and cut away the hard white part, or remove the stalks and peel the mushrooms (if the latter are used, let the stalks boil with the bones). Place the rolls of meat and oysters, or mushrooms, in layers in the basin ; pour over the stock in which the meat has been standing, wet the edges of the parts, put on the cover, press the edges firmly over, cover with a greased paper, and steam from three to four hours. Serve in the basin with a napkin folded round. Game, chicken, rabbit, or steak and kidney, can be used instead. If chicken or rabbit, add half a pound of bacon or ham.

STEAMED CHOPâ€”STEWED CHOP 37 salt on both sides. (If the salt were put on before cook- ing, it would draw the gravy out.) Serve at once. If allowed, one teaspoonful finely-chopped parsley and a few drops of lemon-juice can be mixed with the butter. Bread or apple sauce served with the chop makes a pleasant change, especially when potatoes cannot be allowed. Small mutton cutlets off the neck, covered with egg and breadcrumbs, and fried, are a pleasant change from broiled chops. Steamed Chop. 1 loin chop. 2 oz. rice. Pepper and salt. Cut all the fat off the chop, and put it into a basin with the rice, pepper, and salt, and enough water to nearly cover it. Cover with a saucer, and steam for two hours. Stewed Chop. i chump chop. Pepper, salt and flour. Enough boiling water to just float the chop. Trim off all, or nearly all, fat from the chop ; flour it well on both sides; put it into a small saucepan, and pour over it enough boiling water to float it, but not to cover it, and add the salt and pepper. Simmer very gently one and a half hours, turning the chop over when half done, and skimming frequently. When serving, skim off all fat from the gravy, and pour it over the chop. Decorate with a few sprigs of parsley.

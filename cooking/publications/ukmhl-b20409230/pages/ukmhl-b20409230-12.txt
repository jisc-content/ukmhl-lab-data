2 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY cold water with a little salt (as this also helps to extract the nutriment), when the water will be found to be a bright red, and the meat of a grey colour. The meat and water should then be placed in a jar with a closely-fitting lid, or be tied over firmly with paper, and the jar be placed in a saucepan of cold water, which should be allowed slowly to come to the boil, and kept simmering for one hour. By this gentle heat the beef-tea will be well cooked. It should never be allowed to boil, as at boiling-point the albumen becomes hardened, and this renders it indigestible. For soups or broths, cut up the meat and chop the bones very finely, and put them into cold water with a little salt and moist sugar (the latter by softening the water helps to extract the nutriment), and allow them to simmer slowly for six or eight hours. By these means no coating of solid albumen is formed, but the juices slowly pass into the water, producing a nourishing soup. If the lid of the sauce- pan does not fit very tightly, it is of importance to place a weight on it to prevent the escape of the steam, which would carry off with it much of the nutrition. Beef-Tea. J lb. gravy beef or steak. J pint cold water. A pinch of salt. Remove all skin and fat from the meat, and shred it very finely; put it into a jar containing the cold water and salt, and let it stand from two to three hours. Cover the jar closely (if there is no lid, tie a

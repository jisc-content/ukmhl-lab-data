98 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY Predigested (Zyminised) Milk. Into a clean vessel pour a pint of fresh milk, a teacupful of warm water, and add the contents of a ' zymine ' peptonising tube (Fairchild); set the vessel in a warm place, or in water as hot as the hand can bear for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. At the end of this time the milk should be quickly boiled or placed on ice. If peptonisation be allowed to proceed beyond the specified time, the milk will become bitter. When the peptonised milk is not for immediate use, it should be boiled for two or three minutes, or kept on ice. Boiling permanently stops peptonisation, cold simply suspends it. Milk, Partially Zyminised. Put the powder contained in one of the ' zymine' peptonising tubes (Fairchild) into a clean granite- ware or porcelain-lined saucepan with a teacupful (gill) of cold water; stir well, then add a pint of fresh, cold milk. Place the saucepan on a hot range or gas-stove, and heat with constant stirring until the mixture boils. The heat should be so applied as to make the milk boil in ten minutes. When cool, strain into a clean bottle, cork well, and keep in a cool place. When needed, shake the bottle, pour out the required portion, and serve hot or cold, as directed by the physician. JV.J3 â€”Milk thus prepared will not become bitter.

io THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY Haricot Puree. 1 pint haricot beans. i pint milk. 2 onions, scalded. ^ pint cream. £ oz. butter or dripping. i strip celery or J teaspoonful 2 quarts white stock or water. celery-seeds. Salt and pepper to taste. Soak the beans in cold water for twelve hours, then strain them, and, if possible, leave them to dry for twenty-four hours. (This drying again causes the starch in the beans to commence to change into sugar, making them more palatable and easier to digest.) Then put them into a saucepan with the cold stock, and butter or dripping. When the soup boils, add the onions sliced and the celery (if seeds are used, tie them in a piece of muslin). Simmer from two to four hours, or until the beans are quite soft; the time varies very much : if the beans are stale, they require a long time to soften. The butter or dripping helps to soften them. When quite tender, strain the soup through a wire sieve; rub the beans, etc., through with a wooden spoon. Return the soup to the saucepan, add the milk, cream, pepper, and salt; stir until the soup is quite hot. Potato Puree. 2 lb. potatoes, parboiled. i leek, i onion. i quart white stock, i strip celery or £ teaspoonful i pint milk, celery-seeds. i pint cream. Salt and pepper to taste. Prepare the potatoes, put them into boiling water with a little salt, boil for five minutes.

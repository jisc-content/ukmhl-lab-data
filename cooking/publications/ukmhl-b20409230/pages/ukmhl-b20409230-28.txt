18 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY FISH. Fish is valuable as an article of food, being nourish- ing and easily digested. It contains less flesh- forming matter than meat or the flesh of birds, hence it is of less nutritive value; but the potash, salts, and phosphates of lime it contains are essential mineral constituents of food. The digestibility of fish, and its nutritive quality, greatly depend on thorough cleansing and cooking, but also on its being in season, for when out of season it is quite unfit for food. As a rule, this can be detected at once by the semi-transparency and want of firmness of the flesh. Fish should also be very fresh. An easy way to test this is to press the finger on the flesh; if fresh it will be firm and elastic, but if it is soft, and an impression is made, it is stale. Fish is, roughly speaking, divided into two classes â€”the white and the oily. The former is the most wholesome and easily digested, as the oil and fat the white fish contain are found chiefly in the liver. Whiting contains the least fat of any, and is therefore the most digestible, and highly nutritious. Many doctors order plaice instead of sole in cases of dyspepsia, as the flesh is lighter. As white fish are wanting in carbonaceous matters, it is necessary that they should be served with starchy foods in order that the right proportion of heat-givers should be added to the flesh-formers they contain. The principal white fish are : Whiting, sole, plaice, turbot, flounders, cod, etc.

35 STEWING mix one teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley with half an- ounce of butter and a little salt and pepper. Spread on the chop or steak when on the plate ; just melt in the front of the fire, and serve quickly. Fried meat is, as a rule, hard because the extreme heat causes the albumen to become solid throughout, and so dries up the fibres, and prevents the gradual access of heat to the interior. It should, therefore, never be given to invalids or convalescents. Stewing. Stews are nutritious, being, as a rule, composed of various substances which contain all the elements of nutrition, and easily digested, because all solid food has to be liquefied before it can be digested, and they assist the action of the stomach in this particular. Stewing consists of cooking meat at a low tempera- ture for a long period in a small quantity of liquid. By the long continuous action of moderate heat, the fibres of the toughest meat are softened, and form a most nourishing dish, for any nutriment which may have escaped from the meat during cooking will be found in the gravy. If tough steak or sinewy meat, such as leg of beef, is used, it will be rendered much more tender by dipping the meat into vinegar after it is cut up; the acid helps to soften the fibres of the meat. This kind of meat must never be fried with the idea of browning the stew; the great heat of frying would only increase the toughness. A good brown gravy should be made, and poured boiling over the meat. It should then be cooked as slowly as possible either 3â€”2

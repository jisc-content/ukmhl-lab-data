THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY boiling put in the tongue, and put on the lid with a weight on it. Simmer very gently for three or four hours, then take out the tongue and let it get cold ; pass the gravy through a sieve. All this can be done the day before it is required. When cold, lard the tongue (which should be skinned when taken off the fire), with large lardoons rolled over parsley, and one shallot very finely chopped up, and a soupcon of nutmeg; then roast it one hour, basting it with the gravy in which it was stewed.

FISH—TO BOIL FISH 19 The principal oily fish are: Salmon, mackerel, herrings, etc. In these the oil and fat are found throughout the flesh, and they are therefore more difficult of digestion, although more satisfying. A dry, tough, woolly texture also shows that the flesh is indigestible. Lobsters, crabs, and all shell fish, with the exception of oysters, are very difficult to digest. Oysters are far more easy of digestion when eaten raw, as the nitrogenous matter they contain is rendered tough and insoluble by heat. Salted white fish contains very little nutriment, as the salting process extracts a very large proportion of it, and hardens the fibrin; and when, as in the case of salt cod, the fish is soaked before cooking, very little, if any, of the nourishment remains. The fat of the oily fish, such as salmon or herrings, is not removed by salting, so they are valuable as food, but not easy to digest. The modes of cooking which retain the whole of the nutritive properties are the best and most advan- tageous, such as steaming or baking (see recipes). If fish is boiled, only just enough water to create steam should be used, as the fish itself contains such a large proportion of water; also because much of the flavour is lost if boiled in a large quantity. To boil Fish. All fish, with the exception of salmon, should be put into hot, not boiling, water; the latter cracks the skin and spoils the appearance. Salmon is put into it to set the colour. Very little water should be used 2—2

THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY (one pint for two or three pounds). The fins of the fish should be added to the water, as they contain gelatinous substance, especially in the case of turbot. If the water the fish has been boiled in is afterwards used for the sauce, it will have a better flavour, and any nutriment that may have escaped into the water will not be lost. A tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice, added to the water, helps to whiten the fish and keep it firm. The white side of a turbot should be rubbed with a cut lemon to keep it white, and the black skin be Cut across in several places to prevent the white skin cracking, which would spoil its appearance when sent to table. Fish should be boiled very slowly, and skimmed frequently. No special time can be given for boiling fish; it depends greatly on the thickness and on the kind of fish. A short thick fish weighing the same as a long flat one would require longer cooking than the latter. The fish should be tried after ten or fifteen minutes with a skewer; if the flesh easily leaves the bones it is done, and should be taken up at once, or it will break and the flavour be spoilt. To fry Fish. Well-fried fish is never greasy; the outer coating of egg and crumbs, or batter, prevents the fat soak- ing into the fish; but to obtain this desired end several rules must be observed. The fish, after washing, must be well dried first with a cloth, and then rubbed with a little flour to ensure its being thoroughly dry; if it is at all damp, the egg and crumbs, or batter, will not adhere to it.

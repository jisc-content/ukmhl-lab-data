11 GIBLET BROTH-ARTICHOKE SOUP Giblet Broth. i set of fowl's giblets. i quart white stock or water. i small onion. i small blade of mace. 2 cloves. 2 tablespoonfuls semolina, tapioca, vermicelli or mac- aroni. Prepare and wash the giblets thoroughly, cut them into small pieces, put them into a saucepan with the stock or water (cold), and the cloves and mace. When they boil, skim well; add the onion, peeled, scalded, and sliced. Simmer very gently from two to three hours, or until the broth is reduced to half the quantity. Then strain, return to the saucepan, add the semolina or tapioca, and boil slowly for fifteen minutes, stirring all the time. Season to taste, and serve. This could be thickened, for a change, with vermicelli or macaroni; if the latter, put it into boiling water with a little salt, boil until tender (about one hour), then cut into half-inch lengths and add it to the broth. Half a glass of marsala added to this is a great improvement. Peel and wash the artichokes, prepare the onions and celery ; put them into a stewpan with the stock or water, mace, sugar and salt. Boil for about an hour, or until the artichokes are tender, then strain and rub through a sieve. Return to the stewpan, Artichoke Soup. ij lb.

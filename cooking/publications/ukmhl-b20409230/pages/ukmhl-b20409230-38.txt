28 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY Stewed Cod or Hake. i lb. cod or hake. i tablespoonful vinegar. i oz. butter. i tablespoonful parsley. 1 egg. 4 peppercorns. J pint hot water. i tablespoonful flour. Salt. Prepare the fish, cut it into slices not too thin, put it into a stewpan with the hot water, vinegar, salt, and peppercorns. Simmer very quietly about fifteen minutes, taking great care the slices do not break, then lift them out carefully and keep hot. Mix the butter and flour to a smooth paste, stir into it by degrees the water in which the fish has been cooked, pour it into a small saucepan, and stir until it boils and thickens. Then add the parsley, finely chopped, and the egg, well beaten ; season to taste, and pour over the fish. If liked, the egg can be boiled hard, the white cut into small dice before adding to the sauce, and the yolk be rubbed through a sieve or strainer on to the fish after it is covered with the sauce. This way looks much prettier, but it is not suitable for invalids, as the albumen in the white of the egg becomes indigestible by boiling hard. Wash the fish thoroughly, and remove the scales. Cut it into pieces, and put it into a very clean white-lined saucepan with the cold water and salt. Let it come to the boil with the lid off, and skim Fish Soup. i haddock, medium size, i pint cold water, i small potato, i oz. butter. 2 leeks, i gill milk. i teaspoonful cornflour.

THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY 32 continued, the albumen throughout the joint would solidify, and render it tough and indigestible, and therefore after the first ten minutes it should be cooked very slowly to slightly harden the inner albumen, and so make the meat firm enough to be cut into slices. Spreading the lean part with dripping, and dredging it with flour, also forms a coating, and helps to keep in the gravy. For beef or mutton allow fifteen minutes to every pound, and fifteen minutes over; for pork, veal, or lamb, twenty minutes, and twenty minutes over. The browned outside of the joint is difficult to digest, and should not be given to invalids or those with weak digestions. The inner slices are lighter and more easily digested, but underdone meat is not, as is commonly supposed, more nutritious. The common plan of sprinkling salt on the joint after it is placed in the dish, and then pouring hot water over it, cannot be too strongly condemned; the salt draws the gravy from the meat, and renders the latter dry and indigestible, and the water soddens it. Gravy should always be poured round, and not over, a roast joint. A good way to make gravy for roast meat is, after placing the joint on a hot dish, and pouring off every particle of dripping from the dripping-pan (this should be sprinkled with flour before com- mencing to roast), to pour into it about a gill of boiling stock, scraping off the brown particles which adhere to the pan ; they will both colour and flavour the gravy.

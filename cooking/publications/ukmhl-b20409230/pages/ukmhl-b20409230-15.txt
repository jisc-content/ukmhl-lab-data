VEAL-TEA-MUTTON BROTH-CALF'S-FOOT BROTH 5 allowed, pepper. It is best to let this tea stand till it is quite cold, when the fat can be easily taken off; if required at once, pass kitchen paper over the top till every particle of fat is removed. Veal-Tea. Proceed exactly as for mutton-tea; but instead of adding barley, thicken ten minutes before serving with one teaspoonful of arrowroot mixed into a smooth paste with a little cold water. Mutton Broth. 2 lb. scrag end of neck of mutton. 1 quart cold water. 1 oz. pearl barley. 1 turnip. 1 carrot. 1 onion or leek. A few sprigs of parsley. Pepper and salt to taste. Wash and cut up the mutton ; put it into a stew- pan with the cold water and salt. When it boils, remove carefully the scum. Prepare the vegetables ; cut them into small pieces; add them to the broth. Wash the barley; add it also. Simmer gently for two hours, skimming frequently ; then strain through a sieve, and season to taste. If possible, allow the broth to stand until it is cold, as the fat can then be removed more thoroughly. The parsley can be either tied in a bunch, and added with the vegetables, or chopped finely, and added just before serving. Calf's-Foot Broth. 1 calf's foot. 1 quart milk. 1 pint cold water. 1 teaspoonful castor sugar. ^ teaspoonful salt. Wash and split a calf's foot. Put it into an enamelled pan with the milk, water, sugar, and salt.

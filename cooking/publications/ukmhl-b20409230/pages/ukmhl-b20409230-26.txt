16 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY as the scum rises. Simmer by the side of the fire for four hours or more. When it has cooked for two hours, add pepper and salt, two carrots, two leeks, one turnip, a little parsley, and a little celery. (Wash the leeks, but cut nothing off.) When serving, cut the bread in thin slices, place in the tureen, pour a little of the liquid over, and cover with a plate. After a few minutes, strain the rest of the soup over it, and serve. The meat from the pot-au-feu must not be given to invalids, but a cupful of the bouillon will be much appreciated as a change from ordinary clear soup, as the flavour of vegetables is so good. If served with a poached egg instead of the bread, it would be a further variety and very nourishing. Meat Essence. (very strengthening.) 4 lb. shin of beef. A fowl. 4 lb. knuckle of veal. Cut all up small, and take away the skin and bone. Put the meat into an earthen jar, tie over the lid close, and over that a paste, and tie down again with a cloth, so as to prevent any evaporation. The chicken bones may be placed on the top of the meat, and add a little salt and butter, but no water. Place the jar in a large saucepan, with plenty of water round, to keep simmering for eight hours at least; then pour off the essence, and give in small quan- tities to the patient either as a jelly or liquid, whichever is preferred.

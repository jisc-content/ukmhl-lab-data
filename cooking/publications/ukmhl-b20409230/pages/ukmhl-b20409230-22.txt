12 THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY add the butter and flour kneaded together and made into a paste with a little of the milk; add the rest of the milk, stir until it boils, then add the cream, and season to taste. Prepare the spinach and onions, shell the peas and put aside a large cupful. Melt the butter in a sauce- pan, add to it the rest of the peas and the other vege- tables, and a good handful of the shells well washed. Put the lid on, and let them steam for fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally, and taking care they do not burn. Then pour over them the stock (boiling), add the ham cut into small pieces, and the sugar and salt. Boil slowly for one hour, then pass all through a sieve, return to the saucepan and stir until the soup boils ; add salt to taste. While the soup is being rubbed through the sieve, boil the cupful of peas in sufficient boiling water to cover them, with a very little salt. When quite tender, pour them and the water that may remain with them into a hot soup- tureen, and pour the boiling soup over them. This soup should be a pale green colour. If not green enough, press the juice from a few leaves of boiled spinach ; add a few drops until it is the right colour. Green-Pea Soup. J peck fresh green peas. 3 spring onions.

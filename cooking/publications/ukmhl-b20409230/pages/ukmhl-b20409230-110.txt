ioo THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY It may be used at the table instead of ordinary milk with tea and coffee. Milk, Effervescent Zyminised. Put some finely cracked ice into a glass, and then half fill it with cold Apollinaris, Vichy, or aerated water, as preferred; then quickly pour in the zyminised milk, and drink during effervescence. Zyminised milk may be made agreeable to many patients by serving with a little grated nutmeg, sweetened with Kepler malt extract, or flavoured with a little brandy, etc. Milk, Brandy, and Egg. Place an egg in a tumbler and beat up into a froth, add powdered sugar to taste, and a dessert- spoonful of brandy. To the mixture add quarter of a pint of fresh or zyminised milk. Digestive Whey. Curdle warm milk with the pepsencia (Fairchild), as under ' Digestive Junket'; when firmly curdled, beat up with a fork until the curd is finely divided, then strain, and the whey is ready for use. Whey is a highly nutritious fluid food, containing in solution the sugar and salts (mineral constituents) of milk, and holding also in suspension a considerable portion of casein and fat (cream) which pass through the strainer. It is peculiarly useful in many ailments, and always valuable as a means of imparting variety to the diet of the sick. In the form of this digestive whey it is frequently resorted to as a food for infants to tide over periods of indigestion.

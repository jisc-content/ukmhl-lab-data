THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY 72 Nun's Pudding. The yolks of 3 eggs and the white of 1 egg. ij pints milk. 2 oz. loaf sugar. J lb. ratafia biscuits. 2 tablespoonfuls flour. Pink sugar or crimson ' hun- dreds and thousands.' Grated lemon-peel. Beat up three eggs, leaving out two of the whites. Add to them gradually one and a half pints of milk. Then mix very carefully two tablespoonfuls of flour and two ounces of loaf sugar, with grated lemon-peel to give a flavour. Boil these ingredients over a slow fire, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until the flour is quite dissolved. Prepare a dish with ratafia biscuits to cover the bottom, and when the cream is sufficiently boiled, pour it through a sieve upon the biscuits. This dish is always served cold, and should be powdered with pink sugar or crimson ' hundreds and thousands ' just before sending to table. Sponge Cake Pudding. 3 stale sponge-cakes. Jam or raspberries and red currants. J pint milk. 1 egg. Sugar to taste. Cut the cakes in slices, spread them with the jam, or crush the fruit with the sugar, and place the cake and fruit in alternate layers in a small pie-dish. Warm the milk; add it to the egg well beaten. Pour it slowly over the cake in the dish, and bake in a very moderate oven for twenty minutes. If liked, grated lemon or orange rind can be sprinkled on the layers of cake instead of jam, or fruit and sugar.

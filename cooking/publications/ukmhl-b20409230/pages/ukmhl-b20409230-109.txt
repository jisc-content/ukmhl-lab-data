MILK, HOT ZYMINISED, AS A BEVERAGE 99 Digestive Junket. Take half a pint fresh milk, heated lukewarm—not warmer than can be agreeably borne by the mouth— add one teaspoonful of pepsencia (Fairchild), and stir just enough to mix. Let it stand till firmly curdled. The junket may be served plain, or with sugar and grated nutmeg. Milk, Hot Zyminised, as a Beverage. Into a clean quart bottle put the powder contained in one of the ' zymine' peptonising tubes (Fairchild) and a teacupful of cold water; shake, then add a pint of fresh, cold milk, and shake the mixture again. Place the bottle on ice till the mixture is required for use. When needed, pour the portion to be used into a saucepan, and heat as hot as can be agreeably sipped. If required for immediate use, the ' zymine' peptonising powder, cold water, and cold milk may be thoroughly mixed in the saucepan, and heated to the proper temperature for drinking. At this temperature (and during the heating), the zyminising powder acts with great rapidity, and in a few minutes a hot peptonised milk may be pre- pared which will be sufficiently digested for the majority of cases. Hot zyminised milk is the most grateful, nourishing, and bracing beverage for in- valids, dyspeptics, diabetics, and consumptives; it is especially useful with breakfast, and at any time when suffering from a sense of exhaustion, with an intolerance for solid food. It is very acceptable to persons who require nourishment before sleeping, especially if a little Kepler malt extract be added. 7—2

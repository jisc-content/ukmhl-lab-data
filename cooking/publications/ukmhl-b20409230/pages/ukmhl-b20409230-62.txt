They contain scarcely any fat or nitrogenous substances, and require to be eaten with meat, fish, butter, or milk. They are best steamed or baked, to prevent the loss of salts; the latter is also the easiest way for digestion. If boiled, they should be always put into boiling water, never into col.i, to harden the outer ring of gluten, or vegetable albumen ; this prevents the water entering into the starch in the centre and making the potatoes watery and waxy, which would render them very difficult to digest. For people with weak digestive powers, potatoes should always be put through a potato- masher or fine sieve.

Wine Sauce, quickly made. i wineglass sherry. 1 oz. butter. 2 tablespoonfuls castor sugar. Put the ingredients in a cup or small saucepan until the butter is melted and the sauce quite hot; but it must not boil. Then serve. Vanilla Sauce. 2 oz. loaf sugar. \ pint cold water. i inch vanilla stick. i tablespoonful arrowroot. Boil the water, sugar and vanilla stick ten minutes, then add the arrowroot mixed smoothly with one tablespoonful of cold water. Boil five minutes, stirring well. Take out the vanilla and serve. If liked, two tablespoonfuls of rum can be added. Gruel. i tablespoonful coarse oatmeal. Sugar to taste. i pint water or milk. A small piece fresh butter. A little ginger, if liked. When the water boils shake in the oatmeal; stir for five minutes, then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and simmer slowly for quite one hour. Strain and sweeten, and flavour to taste. Coarse oatmeal gives the gruel a nicer flavour than the fine, but should always be strained, as the rough pieces very often irritate the digestive organs. If the patient is not feverish, and the flavour is liked, the gruel may be flavoured with two table- spoonfuls of rum.

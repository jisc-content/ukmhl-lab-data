If cooked alone it should be steamed, so that none of the small amount of saline and nitrogenous matter it contains be lost in the water. Semolina, macaroni, and vermicelli are the richest in flesh-formers of all these foods; they are made from a hard and highly-nitrogenous yellow wheat grown chiefly in Italy. Semolina is the wheat coarsely ground. Maize, hominy, and oatmeal are also very nutritious ; the latter acts as a slight laxative with some people, and the coarse oatmeal often causes dyspepsia. Gruel, when made from the coarse, should be cooked slowly for quite one hour, and then strained; thus prepared it is highly nutritious for invalids.

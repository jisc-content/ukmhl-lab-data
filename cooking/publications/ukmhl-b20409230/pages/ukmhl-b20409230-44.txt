THE NURSE'S HANDBOOK OF COOKERY or convalescents, it has not been thought necessary to enter into the subject of boiling salt meats. Broiling or Grilling. This has nearly the same effect on meat as roast- ing ; the outer albumen is hardened, forming a skin or crust, and so retaining the juices. To do this perfectly, a bright clear fire is necessary, and the bars of the gridiron should be heated before the meat is placed on it, as the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers. The meat should be put close to the fire for one minute, and then turned so as to prevent the escape of the juices on the side furthest from the fire. The meat will be much more tender, and full of gravy, if it is turned frequently. A fork should not be used in turning, as it would make holes and let the gravy escape: use either the tongs sold for the purpose, or a knife and spoon. Meat broiled over the fire has a better flavour than that broiled in front of it. To broil meat well is one of the best ways of preparing it for invalids ; it is then easy of digestion, as nearly all the juices are retained. Allow from ten to fifteen minutes, according to the size of the chop or steak, which should be thick. Chickens, when broiled, are split in half. Fish is usually wrapped in buttered paper for broiling. Serve the chop or steak as quickly as possible on a very hot plate; put a little butter, pepper, and salt on each side (salt must never be put on before cooking, as it draws out the gravy). For a change, maUre d'hStel butter can be used. To make this,

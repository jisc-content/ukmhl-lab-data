BOILING MEAT 33 Boiling Meat. In the notes on soup, etc., we endeavoured to show that if we wish to extract the nutriment from meat we must put it into cold water; but in boiling a joint for the table our object must be to retain, as in roasting, the valuable red juices by hardening the outside albumen, and so forming a crust or coating. To do this, the joint must first be plunged into boiling water, and allowed to boil for five minutes, removing the scum as it rises, or it will boil down and dis- colour the meat. Then add a large cupful of cold water to reduce the heat, and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire where the water will only simmer, the heat never being allowed to exceed 170Â° Fahr. during the whole time of cooking. Allow twenty minutes to every pound, and twenty minutes over; this is five minutes a pound longer than for roast- ing, owing to the low temperature of the water. If necessary, the joint should be tied round with string, and not fastened with skewers, the latter making holes through which the juices would escape; the meat would thus become dry and less nutritious. Meat, with the exception of heart and liver, should not be washed, as the water takes out some of the nutriment. If the meat is not quite fresh, it can be wiped with a cloth dipped into vinegar and water. Vegetables, if liked, can be cooked with the meat. Gravies or sauces should always be poured over boiled meat. As these notes are intended for cookery for invalids 3

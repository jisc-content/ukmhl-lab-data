12 Plasmon. This applied to all dishes, from soups to sweets and savouries. The soups submitted for competition were of the purte and mixed vegetable order, both with and without meat foundation. In all cases Plasmon, while not interfering with the flavour, gave a most agreeable impression of strength and velvety softness. High marks were accorded for the gastro- nomical value of the soups. Entrees of various kinds were sent in; the addition of Plasmon had apparently facilitated the work of the cooks, at all events the results were excellent. Cutlets dipped in a kind of batter formed chiefly of Plasmon and egg, then crumbed and fried, proved delicious ; while the croquettes possessed a creamy interior. Plasmon as an addition to the vegetable dishes also proved a success. But we regret to say that the avowedly “ Vegetarian Cookery” dishes did not attain so high a level, either as regards appearance, originality, or flavour. Nevertheless, we think that this was accidental, as we are decidedly of opinion that if Plasmon were judiciously used it would tend con- siderably to enhance the dietetic and gastronomic value of vegetarian cookery.

H Plasmon Stock is the foundation of many dishes, and is referred to in a number of the recipes. If used for whipping into a nourishing cream, it must be quite cold (and is best made overnight for the next day’s use); but for adding to milk, coffee, soups, and certain other dishes, it may be used hot as soon as made. Stock will keep a day or two if treated as milk. Note.—If the saucepan be rinsed with cold water it prevents burning. A WHITE STOCK FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES. 4. To 4 teaspoonfuls of Plasmon Powder add gradually i pint of tepid water, stir till it boils, and while boiling add | saltspoonful of salt to restore the white colour. If used for soups, vegetables, rice, barley, etc., can be added, and any additions of flavouring used. PLASMON COCOA. 5. For each breakfast cup take i to 2 teaspoonfuls of cocoa, mix into a smooth paste with g cup of milk, add § cup of water, and boil for 2 minutes. PLASMON TEA. 6. For each person put 1 teaspoonful of tea into a teapot previously heated, add boiling water, and let stand for 3 minutes to draw. PLASMON CREAM. 7. Is made from Plasmon Stock (No 3) as follows:—Put 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls (not more at a time) of Plasmon Stock into a large cup or one pound jar, whisk briskly a few minutes, when a thick cream will result. Add sifted sugar and vanilla, or other flavouring to taste, whisk quickly again for half a minute. This cream can now be used for tea, coffee, cocoa, stewed fruits, etc., or may be eaten alone. A “ Dover” wheel whisk gives the best results—namely, Plasmon Whipped Cream ; the longer it is whisked the thicker it becomes. Note.—To have this Cream in perfection, it is essential for the Stock to be quite cold.

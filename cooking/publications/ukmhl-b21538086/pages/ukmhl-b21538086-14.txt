IO unaltered condition. Plasmon is the result of prolonged investigations. It is the albumen (proteid) of pure milk, containing its most important original salts, prepared by a process which does not alter its vital and physical properties or in any way lessen its nourishing effects. The albumen (proteid), as it exists in fresh milk, remains absolutely pure, though in a dry granulated form, and retains its properties unchanged for an indefinite period, and is perfectly soluble. Plasmon added to any food—no matter how poor such food may be in albumen (proteid) substance—at once raises the nourishing value of the food, a teaspoonful of the Plasmon powder being equal to the nutriment contained in | lb. of prime fillet of beef. It is flavourless and odourless. Plasmon, owing to its high nutritive qualities, and the perfect way in which it is assimilated, invigorates the digestive system, so that other foods taken with it, or after it, are more easily digested. Although it increases the weight, it does not do so by inducing the accumulation of fat—but owing to the ease and rapidity with which it is absorbed by the system, it gives strength to the digestion, and speedily rectifies all irregularities in the nutrition of the body; so that while semi-starvation from imperfect digestion becomes impossible, so also are the many evils which result from the morbid absorption of fat and the use of non-nourishing foods prevented. A feature which demonstrates the strengthening qualities of Plasmon is, that when it is taken regularly, the craving for alcoholic stimulants—even among confirmed inebriates—is subdued. Plasmon, being free from flavour, and smell, and perfectly soluble, is an ideal food-enricher for all classes of the com- munity, and can therefore be applied to all descriptions of foods.

The following six recipes have been specially prepared by Miss Ball, L.C.A., diplomee of the National Training School of Cookery, diplomee of the Cercle Agricole, Paris, and medallist of the Cookery and Food Exhibitions of 1893, 1895, 1S97, 1899, and 1903. It is a well-recognised fact that one of the reasons for the excellence of Continental cookery is the art with which foreign cooks make use of sauces. By this means they make meat and fish palatable, and greatly add to the gastronomic and dietetic value of vegetables. A well-made sauce is a work of art and a help to digestion. In the half-dozen recipes the cook will find special help, as they all contain Plasmon, and are therefore nourishing. So that by using these sauces not only will the dishes be made more tasty, but even such “watery ” vegetables as marrows and turnips will have a nutrient value added to them.

THE LARDER 27 from the loin, “best end” of the neck, and the leg. On the other hand, the bones in these cuts are smaller and weigh less than in other joints, so that advantage is gained in this way. In the shoulder, which is considerably cheaper in price, the bones count for nearly half the total weight. Veal and lamb, being young and not fully grown meats, are less digestible than beef or mutton, but when well cooked they are nourishing, veal particularly so because of the amount of natural gelatinous matter it contains. Veal wastes less than any other meat in the process of cooking. Being naturally lean, it combines well with bacon and ham, and it is an advantage to cook the two together, one helping to make out the cost of the other. The bones of veal should always be well broken up, as they contain so much gelatine and in a stew or in broth add greatly to its enrichment, or when merely roasted the gravy becomes very much improved. Pork, though the cheaper meat to buy, is less nourishing and more difficult to digest, because it contains so large a proportion of fat—over-rich fat. Fat and water account for eighty-seven out of every hundred parts in the weight of pork, therefore it cannot be said to be economical, since both these constituents waste very much by ex- posure to heat in cooking. Pork meat is at its best when cured and smoked and sold as bacon; it is more profitable according to weight, wastes less, digests better, and is altogether more nutritious. Bacon goes further and is more easily digested

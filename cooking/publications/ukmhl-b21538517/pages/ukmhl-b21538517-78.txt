62 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK this, salt and pepper and a few breadcrumbs sprinkled over, one or two spoonfuls of milk added, and then the dish set in a hot oven or under the gas grill just long enough to set them and make the surface slightly brownâ€”altogether the work of about twenty minutes. Many people prefer to cook bacon in the gas oven instead of in a frying-pan, and it is sure to be tender done in this manner, though not so crisp as when fried. Cold boiled potatoes left over from the previous dinner may be sliced and tossed in the frying-pan, sprinkled with pepper and salt and dried parsley, and served with the bacon; while almost everybody likes to find a few pieces of fresh tomato among bacon slices. Eggs, of course, can be fried, or poached, or boiled to make variety. With a few spoonfuls of porridge or flaked oats to begin the meal, a portion of any one of these dishes mentioned, some toast or bread and butter and a taste of marmalade to finish, and, of course, coffee or tea to drink, the working members of the family start their day well and comfortably pre- pared for any demand that may be made upon them. And a breakfast of this kind is needed just as much by the young boy or girl attending school, while the little ones at home could have the same, minus, of course, the meat dish. There is one way in which our English breakfast, as outlined here, might be made better still, and that is by adding to the table a plate of fresh ripe fruit in summer, or a little stewed or baked fruit in winter. We do not eat enough fruit as a rule.

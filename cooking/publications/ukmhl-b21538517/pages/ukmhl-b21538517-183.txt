BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRIES 167 butter, with two ounces castor sugar, stir in next, three eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately—a few drops of lemon flavouring, and half-pound self- raising flour. Beat well and pour into shallow tins about an inch and a half deep. This should bake fifteen minutes in fairly hot oven, but not browned. Slip out of the tin, and when cool cut into shapes and again in half across to spread jelly or icing between, cover with liquid jelly or icing, and roll some in pistachio nut (ground) or ground almonds, some in cocoanut, and some in icing. The mixture can be baked in tiny individual shapes, and then be iced or decorated according to fancy. ROCK BUNS Rub into half a pound of ordinary flour a little cream of tartar, then add a pinch of salt, three ounces of sugar, three of currants, and three of butter.

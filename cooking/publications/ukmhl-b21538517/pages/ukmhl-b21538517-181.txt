Turn out to cool and split each one, spreading a layer of the filling between, close, and then spread another layer between the two cakes when bringing them together, thus making three layers of cream or jelly, then cover the whole with icing. The icing should be boiled, and, if the filling of the layer cake is chocolate cream, the icing will be chocolate fondant icing; if coffee cream is chosen, it will be a coffee fondant; if lemon, or French cream, or walnut, then a white icing.

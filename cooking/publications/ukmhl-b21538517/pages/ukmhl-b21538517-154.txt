138 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK Baked Buddings QUEEN OF PUDDINGS This is equally good for eating hot or cold. Make a light mixture of two beaten yolks of eggs, a teacupful of fine white breadcrumbs, a teaspoonful of grated lemon rind, three teaspoonfuls of white sugar, and a pinch of salt, adding a large breakfast- cupful of warm milk to the whole. Pour into a well-buttered pie-dish, putting a morsel of butter on the top of the mixture, which should not more than half-fill the dish, and bake in gentle oven till set firm, but only slightly browned. Withdraw and spread a layer of nice jam—apricot or greengage— over the top, then beat the whites of egg to a stiff froth; add sugar and a few drops of the juice of lemon. Return the pudding to the oven to just set the meringue, and the pudding is ready to serve. LEMON MERINGUE PUDDING This is made with the same mixture as the above, but instead of a layer of jam between the pudding and meringue, a little lemon curd is spread, and the pudding is finished off as just directed. A Cocoanut Pudding would be made the same way, substituting dessicated cocoanut for the lemon rind and flavouring the meringue with a drop or two of almond essence. Two tablespoonfuls of desiccated cocoanut are not too much in proportion to the other ingredients, and a little thick cream greatly enriches the meringue.

i66 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK layer cake, and for French cream take the yolks of two eggs, an ounce of butter, a small tcacupful of milk, a few lumps of sugar, and a teaspoonful of cornflour. Wet the latter with the cold milk, add to the dissolved butter in a saucepan, then stir in the eggs and the sugar and boil very gently till smooth. BOILED SUGAR ICING Take a pound of loaf or granulated sugar and a small wineglassful of water with a few drops of citric acid. Dissolve sugar and water together very slowly at first, using a metal saucepan for the purpose, keeping on the lid. When quite clear increase the heat, skim, and stir, skimming again constantly, then boil fast for about ten minutes. Instead of pouring out the syrup on to a cold wet slab of marble and working it up to a ball of fondant (which is the correct way in confectionery), an easier method for the home is to pour it into a glazed stoneware bowl previously wetted, and to take a spatula and beat it continually till it becomes stiff enough to spread evenly over a cake. It must not get cold before doing this, or it will not spread well. Use a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold water to smooth over the surface last of all.

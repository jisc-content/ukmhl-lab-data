A SMALL KITCHEN 5 soup-making purposes, made like the china in such delightful shapes and colours that it is a pleasure to use; at least, one is sure that what is cooked in these will not turn out either “ a burnt-offering or a bloody sacrifice,” as a certain Scottish parson described the dishes which his untutored wife prepared for him ! As we shall presently return to a more detailed consideration of our cooking utensils, we must now give thought to the larger and more important fitments of the kitchen itself. Even the smallest kitchen has usually some sort of permanent fitted dresser, and sometimes this is a quite commodious affair. If there are several upper shelves, it is worth while going to the expense of having the three top ones closed in with glass doors, and to store there such portions of the dinner-service and spare china not frequently used. This will obviate any necessity for frequent dusting down and cleaning of shelves. The open space underneath the dresser, usually allotted to heavy pans, boots, or other unsightly objects, can likewise be enclosed with doors of plain wood and give storage for dry goods and cleaning materials. The drawers in this dresser will hold kitchen cloths, dusters, rubbers, etc., but should not be allowed to become, the repository of all the oddments for which no other place can be found. On the top of the dresser will stand the dishes that are too large for the shelves, and anything that is decorative, and this can be covered with a thin washable oilcloth.

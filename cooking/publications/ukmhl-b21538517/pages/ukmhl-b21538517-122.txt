io6 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK the bones of mutton are less heavy in proportion. The primest mutton is Welsh, which is small sized and delicious in flavour, but it is high priced. The next primest is Southdown, which is larger and of richer quality and also high priced. As a rule, large mutton is more tender and more nourishing than that which is medium sized or small—Welsh mutton excepted. Much cheaper than English mutton is Canterbury lamb or New Zealand mutton. This is also very good and sweet, especially for eating hot; it is apt to seem some- what flavourless when cold. But for the small family requiring small joints it is highly to be recommended, and, while it loses more in cook- ing than English mutton does, it wastes less than -frozen mutton, is more juicy and better flavoured. It is better to buy Canterbury lamb by the whole joint and cook it without dividing —a whole shoulder, a whole loin or leg, and so on—thus keeping in the full flavour of the meat. The best parts of mutton or lamb for roasting are the loin, shoulder, “ best end ” df the neck, and leg. The leg is also the primest cut for boiling, though the shank half of a shoulder is hardly less good.

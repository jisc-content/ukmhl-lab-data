A SMALL KITCHEN 15 Where washing is done at home, a little money will have to be spent upon fitting out the scullery with suitable tubs, a big boiling-pan and water scoop, a clothes-horse, scrubbing-board, and pails. Irons and an ironing-board will also be needed, and a receptacle made for soap, starch, etc. A stout clothes-line for outdoor use and clothes-pins will be needed, and for drying indoors the handy home carpenter can make a wooden bar to let down with cord and pulley. This is much neater than stretching a cord across the scullery, and is quite easy to compass.

We add very little water to a stew, because it is desired to cook the meat as much as possible in its own steam and natural moisture. Hence a stewpan must have a closely fitting lid, and it must be given plenty of time to perform its cooking. Frying is one of the quickest modes of cooking, and it is one whereby a very savoury flavour can be given to food. But it is also a mode of cooking that may render food quite unfit to eat and very unpalatable, if the cook is careless and does not understand how to fry. The secret of pro- ducing a successful “ fry ” is in giving the object fried what cooks call a surprise^ that is to say, it should be suddenly plunged into fat so hot that its outside becomes a crisp brown case which encloses the interior so securely that even if that interior be quite soft and juicy, like a ripe fruit or a spoonful of soft mince, it cannot escape.

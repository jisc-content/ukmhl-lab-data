THE MENU 37 is to secure a suitable type of nutrition as well as a suitable amount of it, and this not merely as far as our means allow, but often in spite of our limitations ! It stands, indeed, for something more than this, for each day’s meals are part of the whole life’s health and effectiveness, and it is when this great fact is realised that we see how vitally important is the work done by the little home cook. If she shirks it or does it in a half-hearted manner, the comfort and peace of the whole household will suffer grievously. Let us understand clearly what our daily menu has to provide for us. We live on food, water, and air. The full-grown man or woman, it has been found, takes in daily through the mouth and lungs (air being in this sense as much a food as solid matter and water) as much as eight and a half pounds weight daily. Corresponding waste is per- petually occurring through the different channels formed by the skin, breath, kidneys, and intestines. The menu, then, must provide us with food both solid and liquid. The former is composed of fat, sugar, starch, blood-making material, salts, acids, and minerals ; the latter we take as drink and in the form of watery fruits and vegetables. Fat we find in butter, oil, dripping, or lard, in milk, cream, cheese, nuts, cocoa, and chocolate. Sugar is present in all the ripe fruits, in wheat and starch grains, and some vegetables. Starch, which in the mouth turns to grape sugar, is found in farinaceous foods, flour, potatoes, and cereals. The blood-making foods are meat, fish, eggs, and milk.

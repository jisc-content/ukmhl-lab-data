i8o THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK water gives the best success, and that is obtained by adding carbonate of soda, and the addition of this will greatly facilitate the cooking of beans and such-like things. Soda cannot, how- ever, be added to water intended for making tea' and coffee, without running the risk of spoiling the flavour thereof. Where the purity of water is doubtful a piece of alum should be dissolved in it, and where soda cannot be used to soften it a little borax is sometimes admissible. Hard water, however, will make good tea and coffee, provided the blend chosen be selected for it, and some firms make a speciality of suiting their blends to the water of different districts. Soft water for drinking or culinary purposes should always be filtered before using, while it may be further purified by boiling. The first requisite for the making of good tea and coffee is water absolutely at boiling-point— and it is strange how few people really know when water does boil! The boiling-point is, as every one should remember, 212° Fahrenheit, and when it reaches this violent bubbling ceases, while a volume of steam is thrown off. When the kettle “ sings,” or when the water gallops hard, it should not be mistaken for boiling—and yet there are quite clever people who will make tea as soon as these stages are reached! The un- lettered cook, on the other hand, will come and say, “ Shall I fill the pot, ma’am, the kettle has been boiling a long time?” What she has to learn is that water overboiled has lost its natural

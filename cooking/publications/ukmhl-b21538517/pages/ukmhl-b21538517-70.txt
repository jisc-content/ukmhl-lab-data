54 the successful HOME COOK Now we will sum up the foregoing reasons and principles for the convenience of the home cook who is tentatively putting them into practice. Roasting that is done before the fire will need that the fire shall have been built up level with the top of the range and left to burn till clear, so that all smoke and flame shall have passed off. The meat should be kept a little distance from this at first, but when the fat begins to run, bring it quite close and turn and baste constantly. Roasting in a gas oven will require the gas to have been lit for fully five minutes previously, then it can be lowered for about ten minutes while the joint heats through, and then raised to a sufficient height, but not so as to scorch or burn the meat. Boiling of fresh meat that is to be eaten requires that the water shall have reached boiling-point, and when the meat is put into it the pan is withdrawn from the heat to check boiling and is gradually brought up to the boil again, then kept cooking just below this point. Fish is put into boiling water, but not allowed to more than simmer after- * â€¢ wards. As fat or oil never really boils in the same way that water does, its heat can be tested by dropping into it a piece of the soft crumb of bread ; if this begins to brown directly, the fat is hot enough. Fat is boiling when a faint blue smoke arises from it. If kept occupied, that is, as long as there is some- thing in the pan, fat will not burn; but if given nothing to do, it will soon become scorched.

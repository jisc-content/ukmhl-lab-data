METHODS OF COOKING 53 pan is a close-fitting one with cover intended for holding live coals, the heat is obtained from above as well as from beneath, but inside a steam is generated which prevents any drying either of the surface or of the natural juices. Braising makes anything much more succulent than roasting or baking; but as the process of cooking is a slower one than either of these, a finer cut of meat would become soft and be apt to fall to pieces. But a cheaper cut of an inferior kind, or an old bird among poultry, become tender and juicy and eminently eatable by this process, when by any other they would have been tough. It is not necessary to possess the correct type of braising- pan, however, especially when we cook by gas. The earthenware casserole makes an excellent substitute, providing its cover fit tightly; this we place in the oven, subjecting it to a slow steady heat for a somewhat longer time than if we were considering a stew. When the cooking is finished, a piece of braised meat can be left to get cold without removing the cover of the pan, or better yet is to take off this cover, invert a plate over the meat sufficiently small to fit inside the pan or casserole, put a heavy weight on that, then leave to get cold. To do this makes the meat cut more firmly and causes the gravy to form a jelly round the sides. A very lean piece of meat, especially veal, should be larded through with strips of fat before putting into the braising pan or the casserole. This is a great improvement to its flavour, besides supplying moisture.

A still further improvement is to drain the cabbage—or spinach—when tender, to press it dry, and return it to the pan with a piece of butter, some pepper and salt, and to let it steam through, this time closely covered, for about ten minutes. When greens have been boiled hard for a long time to make them tender, without the aid of any soda and without any change of water, the result is a colourless, flavourless mess, with nothing to recommend it but that it supplies work for the digestion to do until got rid of. Properly boiled cabbage, on the other hand, can prove a positively delicious dish. When boiling white vegetables, besides salt a little vinegar is often added to the water, in order to keep their whiteness, and some, like Jerusalem artichokes and very young turnips, are often boiled in milk. Vegetables cooked beyond their proper time soon become sodden; they should be drained the moment they are done.

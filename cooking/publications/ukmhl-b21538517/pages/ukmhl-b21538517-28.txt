12 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK of cast-iron, also enamelled white, for boiling fruit or pieces of bacon or meat are likewise a useful possession. Cheap tin saucepans are not worth buying, they wear out so quickly and become rusted, but two large saucepans in block-tin are indispensable for boiling greens and boiled puddings, and one of these may with advantage be oblong in shape, so that it may be used for a roll pudding or for boiling fish. When these saucepans are scoured with Vim after using, and are well dried, they last a very long time. The cookâ€™s character may be judged by her saucepans. If she be a dainty cook, she will keep each one rigidly to its proper use; if her sensibilities are blunted, she will use them all indiscriminately. The smaller-sized enamelled ones should be kept for milk, sauces, rice, etc., and a small one of block-tin for brown gravies; one large enamelled pan should be devoted to potatoes and root vegetables, and another one for the use of vegetables that are liable to tarnish the pan, such as beans and onions. Thus a set of six or seven enamelled saucepans will be needed, ranging from one holding three or four quarts of water down to a half-pint. Two or, at most, three pans in block-tin will suffice. A wire frying basket is a necessity also, but this does not need a special pan to fit it, as a large enamel saucepan will answer the purpose equally well, only, if setting up with new utensils, it is just as well to have a proper frying saucepan if you can. The basket is a wonderful help when

METHODS OF COOKING 55 Stnving requires the greatest heat to be applied just at first, then to be checked by putting back into a corner of the stove or oven and given a long time for gentle simmering. The same for braising. The time to be allowed for roasting meat is fifteen minutes per pound, and fifteen minutes to admit of its getting hot through. To boil, allow twenty minutes per pound and twenty minutes for it to reach boiling-point. In baking, the same as for roasting, or rather less. In braising allow thirty minutes per pound, the same for getting hot through, and the same for stewing. When frying one must judge by appearances; a crisp and brown outside is not always an indication that the interior is cooked. Allow a chop to cook more slowly than fish, for example, as also anything that is coated with egg and crumbs or with batter. As a rule, the first sign of anything being cooked through is when a steam begins to rise from it. Only experience will give a cook the judgment that can tell at a glance whether anything is cooked to the right point or not; but after a few trials and observations, one who brings intelligence to bear on the subject need not fear further failures, and a sort of intuitive sense soon becomes developed which enables the cook to judge and arrange and decide almost without consulting her rules.

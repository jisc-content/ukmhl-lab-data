i82 the successful HOME COOK people attempt it at home with a frying-pan. The bean must be cooked as well as coloured, and the deeper the colour the richer the coffee, provided that it be not scorched or burnt. Any beans that get burnt must be promptly discarded. Proper machinery keeps the beans revolving all the time. To rebake the beans in the oven is a good way of reviving stale coffee, likewise to reheat that which is already ground. Having everything hot is another essential in good coffee-making. There are several kinds of patent infusers and coffee-making machines, but none that supersede the common French block-tin cafetiere^ which can be bought at any ironmongery warehouse. Similar shapes in fireproof china are really better, though dearer, because they do not stain or corrode if left with coffee standing in them; but a plain tin cafetiere will last good for years if it be washed out after every time of using, and thoroughly dried. Having the water absolutely boiling, and the coffee all ready in a hot and clean cafetiere, pour over the water by slow degrees, by not more than a teacupful at a time. Let it percolate slowly into the receiving pot below and keep it very hot, but do not let the infused coffee boil, once it is made.

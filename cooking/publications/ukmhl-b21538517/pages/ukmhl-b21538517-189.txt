Ornamentations usually consist of stamped-out leaves and flowers, made with fancy cutters. The edges of pies and tarts are crimped with the fingers, with the dull edge of a knife, or with the points of scissors. It is not good taste to give anything the appearance of having been much handled, therefore the cook should be rather sparing of decoration. A light hand, however, very easily gives the touch requisite for a dainty finish; the main point is to secure perfectly cut edges and absolute neatness. The edges of a pie-dish should be wetted before putting on the crust, as, unless this is done, it will sag when heat is applied and be apt to fall in at the sides. When cutting the edges level, incline the knife so that the top projects slightly over the edge of the dish. Press the edges of the paste well on to the brim of the dish before cutting.

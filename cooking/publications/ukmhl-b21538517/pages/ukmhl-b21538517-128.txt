112 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK dairy fed, which will be small in size and of a deli- cate pink colour and fine texture. Large fat pork is not digestible, and it loses much in cooking. Pork is in season from November to March, earlier than this it is apt to be too young and immature, and later it is coarse; in hot weather it should never be touched. It is hardly possible to cook pork too thoroughly, and for this reason the oven should not be too hot. Pork should be roasted or baked ; it is not suitable for boiling unless it has been salted, nor for stewing. The best parts for roasting are the loin and spare-ribs. If a leg of pork is roasted, it must be a small one and cooked very thoroughly, being well .protected on the outside. Pork chops are very savoury, but if fried they must be cooked well; it is better to lay them in a baking tin and cook in the oven. They should never be grilled. The savoury flavour of pork, whether roasted, fried,' treated as sausages, or in a pie, makes it a welcome addition to the table, and in cold weather it is, if properly cooked, really wholesome and nourishing. It is when it is insufficiently cooked and eaten out of season that it is indigestible. Digestion is helped by putting suitable condiments with pork, as mustard, apple sauce, chutney and tomato, seasoning and curry. All these excite digestion and increase the flow of the gastric juices. As pork can hardly be too well cooked, it is an exception to the general rule that twice- cooked meat is not nourishing, and it lends itself admirably to a Hchaiiffe made hot with curry.

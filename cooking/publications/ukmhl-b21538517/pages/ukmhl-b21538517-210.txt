WATERCRESS SOUP Boil a pound of white haricot beans, after previously soaking them overnight; boil until they begin to mash, then rub carefully through a sieve, and add a pint of water to the pur^e thus obtained. Chop finely a bunch of watercress picked from the stalk, and with it some spring onions, a little parsley or sorrel, or other green herbs. Put this chopped green-stuff into a shallow frying-pan and let it stew gently with butter, then stir in sufficient potato-flour to absorb this butter ; add all to the boiling puree, season well, and just before serving pour in a cupful of boiling milk. POTATO SOUP Boil three or four large-sized potatoes and mash them very finely, then put into the stewpan with a pint of boiling water. Stew a minced white onion in butter until it is perfectly tender, but do not let it brown. Dredge a little potato-flour over to absorb the butter with pepper and salt, and stir this into the boiling liquid. Just before serving beat up the yolks of one or two eggs and stir these with a cupful of hot milk into the pur^e, with a little more butter, then pour into the tureen. Serve grated cheese with this puree.

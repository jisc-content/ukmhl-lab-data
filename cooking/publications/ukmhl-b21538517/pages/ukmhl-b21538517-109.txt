I, • ! riifi 1A j e I ??RNT«AL LIBRARY TREATMENT OF FISH AND PO Smoked and dried fish should be rinsed in hot water before baking or frying them, while smoked II haddock may be cooked in milk instead of in 1/ water and be much improved thereby. Let || kippers and bloaters steam through by covering ! the pan with a plate after baking or frying them. I 'g ^ I The flakes of a cooked haddock (smoked) make V delicious fish cakes combined with boiled rice. ^ In choosing a fowl for roasting purposes it is no > economy to buy a small cheap bird, as the pro- ; portion of meat to bone will be small and there will be no fat to keep it moist while cooking. But i the small cheap fowls which come from abroad I may be made very palatable by braising or stewing them in a casserole with certain vegetable additions and a little ham or bacon. A large- boned and older fowl answers excellently well for ; boiling purposes, a process of cooking which will ! make the flesh tender, while it becomes appetising ! by the sauce served with it. But for eating roast, ) either hot or cold, only the well-fed plump fowl is any good, and that is improved by having a thin slice of fat tied down over the breast. When i braised in a covered vessel a fowl should first be [ larded, and the process is an easy one, only t requiring a few strips of fat bacon or pork, which, f being inserted in the end of a larding needle, are drawn through the skin of the breast by raising j this between the thumb and finger of the left hand, ! putting the needle through with the right. The 1 fat strip is left with two ends standing up at each i insertion.

THE TREATMENT OF MEAT * 105 required, which can be cut from bladebone*^teak, they should be about two inches in width and four in length. Beat them on a flat board, then lay on each strip a thin coating of minced mushrooms and spring onion, seasoning, and chopped herbs. Roll up carefully and tie with tape, then fry the rolls first, afterwards laying them in the casserole with some gravy, letting them simmer for an hour. Another excellent mode of treating beef—one well suited to the children’s table—is to pass through the mincer a pound of moderately fat bacon or ham and a pound of lean uncooked beef, and to add to the meat a few spoonfuls of crumb of bread, of minced parsley, and other herbs, and seasoning, then to moisten with gravy and shape into a firm roll. Wrap this in buttered paper and bake it in the oven for a full hour. Remove the paper and pour gravy round the roll, garnishing it with potato balls. Beef and carrots go excellently well together in a savoury stew, while beef cut very fine and sprinkled Between layers of sliced potato in a deep pie-dish, with seasoning and water added, makes an exceeding good pie, with a pastry crust put on after the interior is cooked. The thin flank of beef, which is usually fairly fat, is an excellent piece for boiling fresh ; it should be boned, rolled round, and pressed after cooking, and then it cuts into thin slices and is sure to be tender. If anything, mutton wastes rather more in cooking than beef does; but, on the other hand.

230 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK of a sufficient height to keep the walls from getting spotted or stained. Wash the tin over with warm water and a little soap to keep that from being unsightly in its turn. Have kitchen aprons made with a frill at the bottom so that the edge of the dress does not run any risk of getting spots from droppings. If the apron is not a pinafore with long sleeves, have deep cuffs or over-sleeves, made to slip on over the dress or blouse, and keep these close at hand. Beaten up white of egg mixed with sugar and lemon juice will cure hoarseness. The yolks of eggs eaten raw clear and strengthen the voice—a useful hint to singers ! In spare moments a good cook may do many things which greatly facilitate her work when she has cake- or pastry-making on hand. For instance :— Almonds can be blanched by dropping the kernels into a basin of hot water, leaving them to soak awhile, when the skins will easily rub off; they are then chopped and dried, or even browned in the oven. Cocoanut can be browned also when it will be wanted for decorating the edges of cakes. Pistachio nuts are dropped into boiling water that contains a good pinch of carbonate of soda, which preserves their green colour. When the skin is rubbed off they are chopped finely, dried, and stored. Lemon rind or orange rind can be grated and then mixed with powdered sugar, dried, and kept in a tin for flavouring cakes.

i88 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK of nettles or dandelions for making beer has no fermenting quality in it, so the addition of sugar and yeast are required to make it work, and the beer is bottled as soon as the first effervescence has passed off. Another excellent and refreshing summer drink is barley water, for making which mix one dessert- spoonful of Robinson’s “ Patent ” Barley with a wine-glassful of cold water into a smooth paste. Pour this into a stewpan containing one quart of boiling water, and stir over the fire for five minutes. Flavour with lemon and sugar, either or both according to taste, allow the mixture to cool, and strain off the barley sediment. For invalids requiring nutriment, a larger quantity of barley should be used and the straining of sedi- ment omitted, or not, as directed by the doctor. Gruel.—Take of Robinson’s “Patent” Groats, one tablespoonful, mix with a wine-glassful of cold water, gradually added, into a smooth paste, pour this into a stewpan containing nearly a pint of boil- ing water, or milk, stir the gruel on the fire (while it boils) for ten minutes ; pour it into a basin, add a pinch of salt and a little butter, or if more agree- able, some sugar. Note.—When gruel is made for an invalid, butter had best be omitted.

BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRIES 155 be more profitable ; and though these are not harmful, it is the use of pure flour and pure yeast alone which gives the home-made lo^f a flavour which a baker cannot impart to his products, call them by what name he will. VVe test flour in three ways: by its appearance, by its odour, and by the touch. The best house- hold flour is of a slight creamy tinge, not dark or even brown, but yet not perfectly white. For fine pastry and biscuits, however, it must be sifted further, and the light flour which pastry and cakes demand is perfectly white and dry. Pure flour has also a certain fragrant odour of its own, and must be free from the faintest suspicion of mouldi- ness. When pressed together in the hand it should retain for a while the shape of the hollow of the hand without immediately collapsing, as this shows whether it contains gluten or not. The more gluten the flour contains, the better it is for bread-making purposes. The actual process of bread-making is in itself the foundation of all culinary processes. It is the basis of the finer arts of pastes, crusts, and cakes, and of all that leads up to the very highest products of skilled mixtures of all materials what- soever ; and thus we see how valuable it is to have a right understanding of its principles.

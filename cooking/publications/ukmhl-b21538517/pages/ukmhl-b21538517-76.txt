Still, if it saves others from temptation, and the day begins the better for it, and health is improved by it, the effort is more than repaid.

When previous preparation is made, the substantial breakfast becomes the work of but a few minutes the next morning. Without this thinking and preparing, however, it degenerates into a scrambled meal, half cooked and unsatis- factory to all concerned.

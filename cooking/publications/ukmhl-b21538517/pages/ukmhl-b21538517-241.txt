RECIPES AND KITCHEN HINTS 227 Saisify, or the Oyster Plant, is a vegetable which, though troublesome to prepare, is yet worthy of the cookâ€™s pains, for it makes an excellent supper dish, accords well as part of a savoury stew, or is good just plainly boiled and served as an accompaniment to meat. For a supper dish, after scraping and throwing the salsifies into water to keep them white, drain them and wipe dry, then dip in batter and fry to a golden brown. They may be rolled in crumbs of bread after dipping in batter to give them a still better appearance. It is an improvement to par-boil the salsifies first, and let them cool before frying, as this ensures them being quite tender. They require no sauce, and make a very tasty dish. Mushroonts may be dressed in many ways, but for a dish alone large ones may be stuffed with a mixture of the chopped stalks, parsley, and butter, sprinkled over with crumbs, and set in a buttered dish and baked in the oven. For stewing it is an improvement to lightly flour the mushrooms, then arrange them in a stewpan with some bits of butter, add pepper and salt and just a teacupful of water, then cover and stew for a good half hour. A small peeled onion is an improvement to the flavour. Mushrooms should be very fresh, very dry, and very carefully peeled,.so that all danger of using unwholesome ones may be avoided. Frame-grown mushrooms are more reliable than those which come from out of doors.

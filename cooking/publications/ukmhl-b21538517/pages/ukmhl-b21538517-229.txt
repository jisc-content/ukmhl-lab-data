RECIPES AND KITCHEN HINTS 215 LAMB OR VEAL SWEETBREADS Wash the sweetbreads and put them into a saucepan with sufficient water to well cover, also a small white onion. Boil gently for fifteen or twenty minutes. Take up, drain on a cloth, and, if a veal sweetbread, cut into slices half an inch thick ; or, if lamb sweetbreads, leave whole and dip into beaten egg, cover with breadcrumbs, and fry to a delicate brown. Keep the sweetbreads hot while some strips of bacon are also fried lightly. For a break- fast dish the sweetbreads and bacon are served without gravy; but for an entree, or supper dish, a little thick gravy is made and poured over them. ITALIAN MEAT CAKES Any kind of cold meat or fowl will make these if freed from all skin and gristle and minced very finely, preferably through a mincing machine ; add to the meat half its quantity of breadcrumbs, some parsley and seasoning, and sufficient gravy or tomato sauce to moisten the whole. Flour the hands and roll the mince into small cutlet shapes, flattening them with the back of a spoon, then coat with egg and fine bread raspings, and fry to a light brown on both sides. Arrange them round a mound of boiled maccaroni or spaghetti, and pour into the dish some hot gravy. IMITATION MEAT CAKES Boil some spaghetti or other Italian paste till soft, drain well, and mix with it a good lump of butter, two or three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese.

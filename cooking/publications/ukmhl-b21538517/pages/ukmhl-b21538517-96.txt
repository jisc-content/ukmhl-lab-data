8o THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK roux is made more gradually and slowly, and removed before it turns colour ; brown roux is pur- posely browned by more rapid cooking. A spoonful of this suffices to thicken and enrich a quarter of a pint of either white or brown stock. For savoury brown sauces to serve with meat dishes and some vegetables, the foundation of the sauce would be bone stock and the additions some roux^ or potato-flour, stirred in and boiled till the right consistency is obtained, and the flavour added last, whether this be with made sauces such as Worcester, tomato, ketchup, chutney, mushrooms, or wine. For fish the sauce is made with either clear water or fish stock or milk, the thickening is butter and flour worked together, and the flavouring (added after the sauce is made) either ready-made anchovy sauce, anchovy or shrimp paste, or lemon juice, egg-yolk, minced parsley or fennel, button mushrooms or picked shrimps, and the necessary salt and pepper. For plain “melted butter,” as a plain white sauce is commonly called, the butter and flour should first be mixed together until perfectly smooth, the proportions being a piece of butter the size of a pigeon’s egg to a dessertspoonful of flour; a little cold water is added to keep the paste smooth, then by degrees a large teacupful of boiling water or boiling milk is stirred in, and the whole is boiled together until quite smooth and clear. Some people add a little more butter at this stage, or a little cream, and, of course, salt.

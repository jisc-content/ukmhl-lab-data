156 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK to form a thin paste; and having this at the temperature of about 85°, he mixes with it first a small quantity of wheat flour, and then the right amount of liquid brewer’s yeast. This mixture is kept warm and allowed to undergo its gradual process of panification, whereby the soluble starch becomes transformed into sugar and is fermented by the yeast, which thus grows and becomes more active, the process taking about eight hours to complete itself. The next process is the mixing of the sponge^ which is made by incorporating this ferment with about a third of the whole amount of the flour which is going to be used, together with water used at the same temperature, in quantity about half what will eventually be used, and salt. When thoroughly stirred together, this sponge—which is made in the centre of the trough containing the flour—is left to rise, always in the same temperature of about 85°. The time it takes to rise will be about five hours, and then it begins to break and to let the carbonic acid gas escape, when the remaining flour and water can be stirred into it, and kneading begins. This is done either by the hand or by machinery. More often in large bakeries this is now done, like the mixing, entirely by machinery, the hand never touching the bread from beginning to end. After being thoroughly well kneaded the dough is left to rise again, standing in a warm place, and when sufficiently risen it is weighed, portioned out, and shaped into loaves, and baked.

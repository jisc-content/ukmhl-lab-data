122 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK of mashed potato may be put. A mixed vegetable pie, made moist with plenty of gravy and season- ing, and covered with a crust of mashed potato (bound together with an egg), baked in a quick oven, makes a splendid dish for a midday lunch or children’s dinner. Mashed potatoes are better for adding to rissoles and croquettes than bread- crumbs, and quite as good as boiled rice for fish cakes. Turnips add a sweetness and richness to most stews into which mutton enters, and parsnips are excellent where there is beef in the compound, or with boiled beef—with which turnips should nevc7' be put—while parsnip fritters, made by boiling and mashing parsnips to a smooth paste, adding a spoonful of flour, some seasoning, and frying this by spoonfuls in hot fat, are a delicious accompaniment to hot roast beef and a change from the usual Yorkshire pudding. There are a few little-known vegetables which make very rare appearances on English tables, but which are not dear to buy and very desirable as food. Among them is celeriac—the turnip- rooted celery—of which only the root is eaten. When pared and boiled, either whole or in slices, and served with white sauce or gravy, this is invariably welcomed as a treat by every one who tries it. A large root can be bought for three- pence or fourpence, and as the vegetable comes in the winter-time when other things are scarce, it is really a great and valuable addition to the table. Having the flavour of celery, it accords with almost any meat—boiled, stewed, or roast.

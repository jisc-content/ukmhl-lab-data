THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK 14 Without going into every detail as to what the small kitchen should possess in the way of common crockery, it may be remarked that a set of kitchen cups and saucers and a few odd plates are neces- sary, as it is very thriftless management that allows portions of the best dinner- or tea-services to be used for kitchen meals; in the same way there should be kitchen knives and forks and tablecloths, even when the kitchen is used by the family for breakfast and occasional meals. Cooking knives and spoons are essential, but these may be cheap and strong, the spoons being of wood or enamel. A basting spoon and a wire fork are other requisites, like a lemon-squeezer, a gravy strainer, an egg-beater, bread-grater, and skewers. Among other minor tools, not perhaps exactly necessary, yet very helpful in kitchen work, are an apple- corer, a can-opener, pepper mill, coffee mill and tin cafetiere^ a sink tidy, housemaid’s gloves, a wooden bowl and pestle, rolling-pin and pastry- board, and a small mincing machine. A saucepan brush, dish-mop, and sink brush are all necessities, and some form of holder for domestic refuse intended for the dust-bin should be devised. The above equipment, if bought new, could all be obtained for the sum of five or six pounds, exclusive, of course, of the larger furniture and the floor-covering; the kitchen completely furnished, with every item mentioned here, including floor- covering, curtains, table, and chairs—but not, of course, including the Hoosier cabinet!—could be comfortably fitted out for ten pounds.

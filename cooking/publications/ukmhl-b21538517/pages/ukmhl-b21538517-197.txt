This is worth remembering by the home cook, who may go on brewing thin coffee and adding to it hot milk, and still fail of attaining a fragrant result. One may make a good coffee essence for oneself by passing very slowly a small quantity of cold water through freshly ground coffee, using twice the amount of coffee as when making it with hot water; pass the water through several times, taking hours to the process if necessary, and then cork down the essence, which will keep for several days. Add boiling water or boiling milk to a spoonful of this essence when a cup of coffee is demanded. Never reheat the coffee itself.

io8 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK does not depend upon meat for its value. For the full flavour of both meat and vegetables to be extracted, it must simmer slowly and for a long time, never boil hard, and the scum should be removed as it forms. A very favourite mode of dressing mutton is to have it curried. In plain family cookery curried mutton generally means cold leg or shoulder rMiauffd. Not so the curry of the good restaurant. For a savoury curry fresh meat must be used, and each piece is lightly fried brown before it goes into the prepared curry sauce to finish cooking by slow simmering in a closely covered vessel. The breast and neck portions are the best for the purpose, each piece neatly trimmed and made as much as possible of even size. These are rolled in flour and fried brown in clarified dripping or butter, then laid in the casserole while in the fat is fried a minced white onion, a sliced apple, or peeled and sliced tomatoes. To these add a spoonful of Halfordâ€™s Indian Curry Powder and a spoonful of baked flour to absorb the butter, then seasoning, a few drops of pickle vinegar, and a cupful of brown gravy or stock. Boil gently for five minutes and strain over the mutton, cover the casserole and set it in the oven, and allow to simmer for an hour or longer. If the apple and the onions have been finely minced, it is not necessary even to strain the curry sauce. Halford & Co., the great Curry People, sell a Curry Sauce which has every necessary ingredient all ready mixed, even to broth, and this saves much time and perhaps failure.

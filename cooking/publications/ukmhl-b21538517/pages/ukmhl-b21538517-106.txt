go THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK menu as often as possible, in as many different ways as possible. For instance, where fish is not forming one of the chief dishes at the midday meal, it is usual to find it introduced as a hors- dâ€™oeuvre, in the form of sardines, salted herrings, or anchovies, and the home cook might also introduce a modest tin of sardines in the same way. We cook fish by boiling, broiling, baking, or frying, and considering the choice in method and the variety in kind there is to treat, it is astounding that a dish of fish is so generally considered monot- onous faring! For boiling, choose thick fish, or pieces such as the middle or head and shoulders when a whole fish is too much. The Dutch invariably choose to boil fish in sea water, but the addition of salt to fresh water suits the English idea better and gives us a fish stock which can make the foundation of our sauce, if we will. As regards quantity of water, only just sufficient to cover the fish should be used, and in addition to salt, for white fish, a little lemon juice or vinegar is an improvement. Small fish, or slices of fish, should be put into water that is nearly boiling, but large thick pieces or whole fish should be put into water that is merely hot and be brought gradually up to the boiling-point, then allowed to simmer until a skewer pierces the thickest part with ease. In cooking slices of fish, or fillets, they may be poached in water, much as one would poach an egg, watching all the time so that they cook just enough, but not too much. This is a delicate way

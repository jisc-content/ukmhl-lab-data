THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK 6 Where the kitchen is large enough, and where the usual fixed dresser is in sufficiently com- modious, or where other cupboard room is short, a Hoosier Kitchen Cabinet would prove a delightful possession to a housewifely soul. These cabinets are made by Tickle, Bell, & Co. of Liverpool, and they serve much the same purpose in the kitchen as the business man’s filing cabinet serves in his office. In the Hoosier cabinet—which is quite an ornamental piece of furniture — every article is arranged in order, the things which are most frequently wanted being in the handiest positions, and everything of a kind grouped to- gether. The cabinet opens out so as to serve as both pantry and kitchen table ; it is dust-proof and mouse-proof; it saves steps, time, and thought; and it helps the housewife to remember exactly what she has in store. To a modern woman, in fact, the Hoosier renders the same service as his Shannon file or Card Index system does to the modern busy man. In most small houses the sink and water taps are fixed in a separate scullery, but where they are in the kitchen itself, or where the scullery opens into the kitchen without a door between, the sink ought, for more than one reason, to be enclosed. The upper part can be shut in so as to cover the plate-rack and any shelves there may be, and the lower part when enclosed will give cupboard space for pails and scrubbing brushes, etc. There is no occasion for the working apparatus to be always in view!

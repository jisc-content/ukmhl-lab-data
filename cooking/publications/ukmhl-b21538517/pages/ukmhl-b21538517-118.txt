One does not baste a grill, but instead it is an advantage to lay the meat in a marinade of oil before putting it on the grid. Grilled chops usually have suffi- cient fat about them to provide their own surface moisture. The principles involved in boiling a potato are mentioned elsewhere, but it may be mentioned here that to put them into water that is nearly boiling, as one would put meat, to bring to boiling-point, and then to cook gently, just below that, is the way to keep in the flavour of a potato as it keeps in the flavour of meat. The most economical of all methods of cooking meat of any kind is stewingâ€”though braising, which is another form of slow cooking, is very nearly as profitable. Nothing is lost in a stew; all the vapour is utilised, and though the meat may shrink in size, its goodness remains in the gravy that is formed. Moreover, as vegetables or rice are generally added to a stew and absorb some of its savouriness, a little meat goes much farther when stewed than when submitted to any other process of cooking. The brown stew-jar or earthenware casserole is the best to use for stewing in ovens, particularly in gas ovens; enamelled stewpans heat too quickly and cook too rapidly to be successful for this purpose. It is quite usual to speak of meat that is baked in the oven as roasted meat; and now that roasting before the open fire is rarely practised, people are

BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRIES 163 of flavouring essence, and a small cupful of hot water j then beat in the whisked whites, and, finally, sift in the flour very lightly. Pour at once into a tin lined with greased paper, and allow the paper to stand well above the mixture to shield it from the fire. Bake in very hot oven, but keep it from colouring too quickly. If a gas oven, lower the gas for five minutes when the cake is half-baked, then increase the heat a little for the finish. Once the cake has risen well it should not fall again, but the oven door should not be opened for the first ten minutes while it is baking. Fruit Cakes RICH PLUM CAKE Beat together to a cream, half a pound of butter and the same weight of sugar; work in half a pound of plumped currants, a quarter-pound of picked sultanas, three ounces of finely shred candied peel, two ounces of ground almonds, the yolks of four eggs, and sufficient self-raising flour to make a soft dough. Beat well and bake in a buttered tin in moderate oven for an hour and a half, keeping protected. LUNCH CAKE Take a pound of bakerâ€™s dough and work into it with the hands four ounces of softened butter, four of sugar, and six of picked sultanas or stoned raisins and currants mixed. Shape into two loaves, and bake in buttered tins for nearly an hour.

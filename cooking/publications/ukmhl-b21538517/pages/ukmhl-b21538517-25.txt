A SMALL KITCHEN 9 plain self-colour for a kitchen floor, as it shows every footmark and magnifies every fleck of dust. Neither choose a large pattern to put in a small room. Something neat, clean looking, and cheerful is all that is required, and if possible have a nice little rug to lay down before the hearth when cooking is done. Kitchens in old-fashioned houses often have stone floors, which need frequent scrubbing and are apt to be both cold and damp. The best covering for these is a thick woven rush mat that covers the whole centre—such mats as one meets with in country cottages abroad, but, failing these, good dyed cocoa-matting is excellent, if it be kept clean. Where the floor is composed of red bricks, the same matting would still be the best and pleasantest covering to put down. But do not put cocoa-matting over a boarded floor, as it harbours dust and soon wears shabby when this is done. A wire fire-guard, standing nearly the same height as the stove and about a foot’s space away from it, is better in the small kitchen than a fender against which one is always hitting one’s toes. If the wire guard has a bright brass rail at the top and is firmly fixed at each end, it is safe without being heavy or cumbersome. It can also be used for airing linen and drying cloths when the fire is low. 1 he window of the small kitchen should be prettily, even daintily, curtained. Short muslin curtains, stretched on rods at top and bottom.

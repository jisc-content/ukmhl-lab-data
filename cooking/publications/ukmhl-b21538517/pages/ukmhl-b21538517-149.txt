PUDDINGS AND SWEET DESSERTS 133 spoonfuls of flour, adding gradually a half-pint of milk. Add salt. Pour into a buttered mould and steam for an hour and a half; or pour into a buttered pie-dish and bake for three-quarters of an hour in hot oven. In either case serve with wine, or raspberry sauce, or with jelly. BOILED FRUIT PUDDING A light suet crust is always the most satisfactory for a boiled fruit pudding, although it is possible to make delicious dumplings with ordinary short crustâ€”using it to line a mould, of course. In either case, if the mould is an enamelled one, it produces a better pudding than will the ordinary white stoneware mould. Grease the mould well, roll the crust not too thin, line it evenly, fill with fruit (uncooked) and put in a very little water, roll a round of the paste to fit the top, moisten the edges and cover carefully, then tie down with a greased paper, and boil the pudding never less than two hours. The filling may be sliced apples, blackberry and apple, plums, apple and plum, gooseberries, currants, currants and raspberries, or any other garden fruit. Foreign or dried fruits are not suitable for these puddings. Pass a knife round between the crust and mould before turning out. The proportions of suet and flour are half of the former to one part of the latter, or of dripping or lard in the same proportions for the short crust. It should be mixed rather stiff and dry.

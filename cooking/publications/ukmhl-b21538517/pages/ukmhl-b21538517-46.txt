30 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK shrimps are well favoured when we are at the sea- side. Smoked fish is both good and digestible, but is not the kind of food to be eaten with great frequency. Its place is among the “relishes.” Cheese as a food we do not value half as much as we should do. We eat it raw, as a “ finish ” to a meal, when it should really be a highly esteemed part of the meal. Perhaps the only familiar form of cooked cheese is the Welsh rarebit—often an indigestible dish enough. But ripe cheese and bread, with celery, a spring onion, or an apple or tomato, form a perfectly constituted meal, and - should be eaten as such. A little dish in which cheese makes a chief ingredient is again an ideal form of nourishment, and can be digested by those who turn away from ordinary ^ cheese. Or grated cheese served with soup, or macaroni, or some vegetables, adds tenfold to the value of that dish. Moreover, the use of cheese grated or cooked opens up so many ways in which the cook may vary and make attractive the bill ^ of fare, that instead of regarding it as an extra, we ought to look upon it as one of the regular items of our marketing purchases. Not a scrap of cheese need ever be wasted, as it is the driest corners and crumbs that we want for our cooking purposes. If buying cheese for eating with bread, buy the best quality and the ripest. New cheese and that which is tough or moist weighs heavy in the scales, but it weighs far heavier on the digestion that is unfortunate enough to be burdened with it 11 1 I I UP II II Ji

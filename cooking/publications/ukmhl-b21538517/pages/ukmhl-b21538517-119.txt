THE TREATMENT OF MEAT 103 forgetting what constitutes the difference between the two methods. The difference between the two flavours is patent enough to any one who has tasted both, and the reason is simple. When meat is roasted most of the vapours pass off up the chimney, or, if roasted by suspension in a gas oven, they pass out in vapour like smoke through the flue. In a closed oven these vapours are shut in and consequently come back upon the meat To be properly roasted in the oven, there must be a current of air admitted by ventilators and pro- vision made for the escape of vapours and steam. But there are parts of meat that are better suited for baking than for roasting, such as the top ribs of beef, a shoulder of mutton, or stuffed fillet of veal. So that each method is useful and necessary, and the point is to choose the method to suit the meat or the meat to suit the methodâ€”as one would choose an actor to suit a part. A sirloin, wing rib, or rib of beef should be roasted either before the open fire or by suspension from the hook in a gas oven, being submitted to full heat at first, then as soon as a brown crust has formed the heat should be reduced ; the time allowed for cooking is fifteen minutes per pound weight, with fifteen minutes for getting hot through. These joints are much improved by frequent basting with hot fat. Top ribs, or a piece of brisket, will boil well, or will be equally good baked. It should be cooked rather slowly and long enough to admit of the bones being slipped out with ease. If for eating

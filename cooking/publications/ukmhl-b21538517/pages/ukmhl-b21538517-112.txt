q6 the successful HOME COOK or fried crumbs. A little game bird that is gener- ally very cheap in price is the ptarmigan, and when nicely cooked is most delicious, lieing of dry flesh it needs wrapping in a sheet of fat or tying in a roll of fat bacon, then laying in a small pan for roasting, or better still it is if braised in a covered casserole that is only just large enough to hold it comfortably. The ptarmigan makes an ideal dish for the small dinner table of two, served with nice brown gravy and some bread sauce. In the winter season blackcock and prairie hen are also cheap birds and very tasty when cooked after a similar manner, while the fat Bordeaux pigeons are not dear for the very small family. There is a large amount of real nourishment in the flesh of these birds, in proportion to their weight, and the bones which are left over should always be added to the stock- pot. All birds of the grouse family should be roasted, and roasted quickly, but without scorching; the larger feathers are plucked and the smaller ones singed off. After drawing them they are wiped out with a soft cloth, but never rinsed. From thirty minutes to an hour, according to size, is sufficient time to allow for roasting any young bird, whether game bird or poultry, if the oven is brisk, as it should be. Slow cooking spoils anything of this kind. Braising will take just twice as long.

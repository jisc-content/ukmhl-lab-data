There is little doubt but that Bath buns date back to the Roman occupation of the city of Bath, and in shape and composition they much resemble the Italian Placenta of that period.

Caraway-seed cake is also another British invention, while Scotch bread, or shortbread, is peculiar to Scotland alone. In addition to combinations of ingredients by various methods of mixing them, different kinds of cake are produced according to the way the mixtures are subjected to heat—whether quick baking, slow baking, top heat, bottom heat, radi-

i84 the successful HOME COOK to general health. If going on a journey or in preparation for a long spell of *work, a cup of chocolate is more sustaining than either tea or coffee, and for children it would be found more nourishing than cocoa and be better liked. It is not difficult to make good chocolate, even where we omit the whip of cream that gives it such a delicate finish, as .served in Vienna. But it cannot be made well with chocolate powder. A bar of a good make of unsweetened chocolate should be taken and scraped to powder, mixed smooth with cold water, and then a large cupful of boiling water added, the whole put into a sauce- pan and boiled for a full minute, stirring all the time; sweeten it then, and when pouring out place a little cream at the bottom of the cup and fill up with the chocolate. A spoonful of whipped cream or mixed white of egg and cream is lightly stirred in at the last, where an extra luxury is desired. Cocoa is made either with boiling water or with boiling milk, according to the make used, but in the latter case a further boiling improves it, return- ing it to the saucepan and the fire for a matter of five minutes or so; and a little cold cream greatly improves the flavour. Quite the readiest way of making a summer fruit drink is to take fresh fruit and press out the juice, strain it clear, put it into a glass jug, add sugar, and All up with soda water or even plain cold water.

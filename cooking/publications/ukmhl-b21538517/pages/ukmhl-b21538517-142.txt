126 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK sweetened make nice little fruit jellies of a nourish- f ing kind for the invalid. Then we have fruit syllabubs, for which we crush the juice from fresh uncooked fruit and mix it with perfectly new milk, about half and half, and sufficient sugar to sweeten nicely, then whisk the two well together. Tall narrow glasses are * three-parts filled with this, and on the top the whisked white of egg stirred into a little fresh ^ cream is piled, and the glasses are set on ice | for an hour, then handed round with sweet 4 biscuits.

The result is that the fruit has kept in all its own flavour and retained its shape. In ordinary stewed fruit the flavour is in the juice, and the fruit is nothing but a dull pulp. It is possible to colour the juice of a compote so as to make it contrast with that of the fruit. One of apples or pears, for instance, where the fruit itself is white or nearly so, can be coloured a bright pink with cochineal. A little saffron will tinge the syrup when oranges or J bananas are the fruit. All the plums make delicious compotes, whereas they are utterly spoiled by prolonged stewing. Fruit that has tough skins, however, need slower and more gentle cooking, ,

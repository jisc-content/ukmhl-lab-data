50 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK from meat for the sake of obtaining a broth, we plunge it into water that is only just warm, and very gradually bring it up nearly, but not quite, to the boil, withdrawing it directly it shows signs of ebullition, and let it have several hours of quite gentle simmering after this. In the end all the goodness will have been withdrawn and yet the broth will be cooked, whereas in the making of beef- tea the juice should be extracted still more slowly, and the simmering temperature maintained all the time. There is always a certain amount of scum to be removed from boiling meat or soup, as this arises both from the meat and the water, and this should be removed while the pot is gradually coming to boiling-point. Meat that has come out of cold storage should be kept in a warm place for several hours before it is cooked in order to bring it to the normal temperature, and for boiling purposes it is better to put a joint of Colonial meat into water that is nearly cold, bringing it gradually to the boil, then treat as before mentioned. Grilling, qr Broiling, is a process similar to roast- ing, only it is used for smaller pieces of meat, such as steaks and chops. These are placed on a grill and held over the clear embers of a hot fire or under the grill of a gas stove, and are constantly turned over and over during the few minutes of their rapid cooking. Stewing is allied to boiling in the sense that the pot which holds the stew must be subjected to its greatest heat just at first, then withdrawn to cook

PUDDINGS AND SWEET DESSERTS 149 sprinkle with red pepper, and set in a hot oven or under the gas grill for a few moments. Sardines drained from their oil and dipped in stiff batter and fried crisp and brown, being piled together in a hot dish, make another tempting savoury. Little rounds of fried bread capped with curls of crisp fried bacon, inside of which curl is a strip of anchovy, make another delicacy. Still another is made by spreading very thin slices of bread with some nice fish paste, closing two together as for a sandwich, cutting this again into small squares, then dipping each square in batter, to fry to a crisp brown on both sides, and serve very hot.

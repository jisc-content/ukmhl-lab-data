26 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK in quantity. The finest qualities of beef waste the least in cooking; the best-grown English and Scotch beef wastes less than does the Colonial or foreign meat. Hence, in buying for small eaters, it is really an economy to choose the best, even though that is the highest in price, for the gain is found after it is cooked, and assuredly so when it comes to be eaten. But as the meat bill in a large family is a very serious consideration, there is nothing to be said against buying Colonial or foreign in that case, since the animals are both well grown and well fed, and in big joints the waste is less in proportion and the flavour greatly better in comparison. Mutton should also be bright red in colour and with clear white fat. The thicker and plumper the meat, the more likely is it to be tender, unless the sheep is altogether very small, like the hardy mountain flocks of Wales, whose flesh is tenderest and sweetest of any. Mutton is more easily <j digested than beef, though it is very nearly as ^ . nutritious, but it is a meat which is less well j adapted for eating cold. It should also be cooked j rather more quickly. In mutton about one-half of its weight will be fat, and a considerable pro- portion of this will dissolve during the process of ' cooking; but clarified mutton dripping makes one of the best of frying fats, so that it is not really lost. It will also make good pastry crusts for meat pies intended for eating hot, but the pastry will be hard when cold. In buying mutton the most expensive cuts are g

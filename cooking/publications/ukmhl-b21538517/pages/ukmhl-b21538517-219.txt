RECIPES AND KITCHEN HINTS 205 halibut will boil well and make a delicious dish, with tomato, mushroom, or lemon sauce and boiled potatoes for accompaniment, and the remains of cooked halibut make capital fish cakes. It is an economical fish on the whole, for there is so little bone in proportion, and a broiled or fried halibut steak would make an excellent first course for dinner. It is also a nice fish for the childrenâ€™s table. Fish Salad, for which cooked lobster or crab is perhaps best suited, requires the broken leaves of a firm white lettuce to be arranged in the bottom of a dish, the flakes of fish freed from all skin and bone disposed among the leaves, and a mayonnaise dressing poured over all. The mayonnaise is, of course, made by beating the yolk only of a fresh egg with as much salad oil as it it will take up, adding a small spoonful of vinegar last, with pepper and salt. It needs very thorough mixing. Cold cooked salmon makes a delicious salad, also cold cooked turbot. In case a present of fresh trout should ever find its way into the hands of the home cook, it is desirable to mention that broiling or baking will be found the best modes of dealing with this most dainty fish. Empty the trout and dry them, then rub over with dissolved butter, and put them under the gas grill for broiling, with not too much heat on, or place in a buttered dish in the oven, covering with paper, and cook for about half an hour. Serve without other sauce than the butter which is in the dish.

lOI THE TREATMENT OF MEAT forethought tells us to build up the fire in good time, or to light up the gas in the oven some ten minutes before putting in the meat, and afterwards to reduce the heat. Frequent basting is another essential to suc- cessful roasting, though in gas ovens, which are described as “ self-basting,” this part of the cook’s labour is saved. In the ordinary range oven, and when roasting before the open fire, constant atten- tion pays for itself in this respect. So great is known to be the need for basting well all dry meats, that it is usual to wrap a piece of leaf-fat round the body of lean fowls or small game birds to ensure that the flesh shall be kept as moist as possible. Young meat like lamb and veal require most basting, as the natural supply of fat is small, while pork needs perhaps the least attention in this way. The fat which runs from the joint is, of course, the best for basting purposes; but where it is not sufficient, it must be supplemented by melting a little dripping in the baking tin, and in the case of small birds it pays to use butter for basting them. ^The fat of salt bacon may be used with advantage for veal, but it will spoil the flavour of game or poultiy. It is said that there is no better test of a cook’s capacity than the way she grills a steak or boils a potato. It is quite true too, for the principles of cooking are all included, and all are required to ensure success. Grilling follows the same principle as roasting, the point being to submit the meat to great heat to begin with, to help

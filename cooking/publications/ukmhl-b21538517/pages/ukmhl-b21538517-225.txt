RECIPES AND KITCHEN HINTS 211 inches broad. These are floured and laid close together in an enamelled stewpan, with pepper and salt sprinkled over and a few minced sweet herbs, and water enough to just cover well. Stew in the oven for about two hours, then just before serving pour in about half a bottle of capers and the same amount of vinegar, and serve. Chopped sorrel, if it can be procured, is used by many in preference to capers. FILLETS OF BEEF, BROWNED The fillet of beef is best for this dish, but a slice taken from the shoulder answers almost as well, or any part that is streaked with fat. Cut the fillets about two inches long by one and a half across and somewhat less than an inch thick. Roll in flour and fry gently in fat on both sides to a good brown, then lay in a stewpan and fry in the same fat a small minced onion and a tomato, and stir into this a spoonful of flour, a little meat extract, and a glass of red wine; add a little water or brown stock and boil for a moment, then rub through a sieve and pour into the stewpan, allowing the fillets to simmer in this gravy for nearly an hour before serving them in a hot dish—a silver entree dish, if you can !—with an accompaniment of boiled French or kidney beans. FILLETS OF BEEF, STEWED Cut the fillets as before, using shoulder of beef or stewing steak this time, and brown them; then add to them in the stewpan some rounds of carrot.

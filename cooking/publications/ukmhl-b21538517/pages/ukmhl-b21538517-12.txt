/ * 4 n / i I i IN PRAISE OF FRUGALITY A LATIN POEM BY POPE PIUS IX. Translated by ANDREW LANG {and reproduced by permissio7i) What Diet lends the strength to life, and frees The flower of Health from each malign disease? Neatness comes first: Be thy spare table bright With shining dishes and with napkins white; Be thy Chianti unadulterate, To cheer the heart and raise the spirit’s weight. Yet trust not much the rosy god,—in fine Be sure that you put water to your wine. Picked be thy grain, and pure thy home-made bread. Thy meats be delicate and dairy-fed; Tender, nor highly-spiced thy food, nor tease Thy taste with sauces from ^gean seas. resh be thine eggs, hard-boiled or nearly raw. Or deftly poached, or simply served au plat. “There’s wit in poaching eggs” the proverb says. And you may do them in a hundred ways. Nor shun the bowl of foaming milk that feeds The infant’s, and may serve the senior’s needs. Next on the board be Heaven’s gift, honey, placed And, sparing, of Hyblean nectar taste; Pulses and salads on thy guests bestow— Even in suburban gardens salads grow— And chosen fruits, whate’er the times afford. Let rose-red apples crown the rustic board. Last comes the beverage of the Orient shore. Mocha, far-off, the fragrant berries bore. Taste the dark fluid with a dainty lip. Digestion waits on pleasure as you sip. 1 wlETROPOLlTAH JOliL nESERVE (qt. ^blio Libharles) 1 Book NurTTW*. I 0 ! O

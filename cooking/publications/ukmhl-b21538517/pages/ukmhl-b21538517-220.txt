Say the loin is one of two pounds’ weight; first take out the under fillet in one piece, and then cut off the fat flap end. Then remove the bones from the upper part of the loin, leaving that also in one piece, from which it is now possible to cut the cutlets in even thicknesses right along. About half an inch is the right thickness. Coat these in egg and crumb of bread and fry to a nice brown, then lay in a dish with cover and let them steam through without further cooking. From the under fillet trim off fat and skin and cut into slices the short way across, and dip these also in egg and crumb of bread and fry the same way, serving them with the former if required; or if these are kept for another occasion they may be placed round a mound of spinach, or served with creamed potatoes or seakale. These little cutlets from the under fillet are most tender and delicious for an invalid, and they may be lightly broiled instead of fried.

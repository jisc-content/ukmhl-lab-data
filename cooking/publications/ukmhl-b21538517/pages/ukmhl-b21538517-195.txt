To make tea in perfection the kettle ought to ^be freshly filled (by preference at the spring, of course!) and then allowed to just reach the boiling point, when the pot should immediately be filled, covered, and set aside to “ draw ” for about three minutes. Some people still follow the fashion of “ mashing ” tea, and, provided they do not “ mash ” it for more than five minutes, the result will be good ; only when tea is mashed all the goodness seems to come out in the first potful, and a fresh mashing is necessary for a second supply. Whereas, if the pot is filled up, stands awhile, is poured off, and then refilled, there is sufficient real “good- ness ” left for two brewings. But given boiling water (not water that is over- boiled), a hot teapot, a few minutes of “ repose,” and last, but not least, a good blend of tea, one can hardly fail to produce a good result. Similarly with coffee; boiling water is the first requisite, but a good blend of coffee is hardly less imperative. It must not only be a well-flavoured bean, but a properly roasted bean. To ensure this, buy it from a good warehouse, see that it is properly roasted and freshly ground, and^ if chicory is added to it, let it be mixed on the spot. A slight admixture of chicory is no detriment to good coffee, and economises it in the using. Roast- ing is a very important point, requiring skill and proper machinery to do it well, although some

VEGETABLES AND FRUIT 125 buttered paper over all, setting the mould in a brisk oven for half an hour, or in a pan of water to steam.

An apple charlotte should be baked until the bread becomes quite crisp and brown, and to help it to do so a little sugar is sprinkled round the mould after buttering, and butter is used more liberally. Such a charlotte is delicious served hot. Apple may receive a few blackberries or plums or damsons to give it flavour, and all these fruits gain by having apple pulp put with them.

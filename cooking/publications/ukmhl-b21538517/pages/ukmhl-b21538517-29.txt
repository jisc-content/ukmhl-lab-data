13 A SMALL KITCHEN frying small fish, fish-cakes, rissoles, and so forth. The ordinary shallow frying-pan should be of black iron with convenient handle; enamel ware burns too readily, and great heat is necessary for successful frying. The omelet pan, on the other hand, may be of the daintiest enamel we can find, and must be kept strictly to its purpose and never by any chance be used for any other. Aluminium ware will serve every purpose equally well, but it is rather expensive to start with. Of French fireproof earthenware, the kind that is rough outside and glazed within, we ought to possess two casseroles, a large and small one, a marmite for soup-making, and a shallow dish for baked eggs. The marmite should be capable of holding six pints, and will cost about two shillings ; one casserole, holding, say, four pints, would cost about the same, and the small one eighteenpence. But the casseroles are for stewing meat and vege- tables, for making economical savouries, and for vegetable cookery, not for soup-making. In addi- tion to this rougher and cheaper ware, our small kitchen ought, if possible, to possess one or two prettily shaped shallow gratin dishes in fireproof china â€” green or brown outside and white within. Whatever is cooked in these comes to table in the same dish, hence the desirability of having a pretty shape and colour. A casserole is often brought to the table too, wrapped round with a serviette. Some little ramakin cases in this fire- proof china are good to possess, if the cook intends to make cheese savouries at any time

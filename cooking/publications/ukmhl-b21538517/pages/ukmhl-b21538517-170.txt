154 the successful HOME COOK to expend her strength in the effort. Pure flour, not too white, is the first essential. On the other hand, in the country district, where the baker’s man is not a dependable person at all, and where flour that has been ground on the spot and yeast fresh from the brewery is to be had, the ability to make a good loaf of bread puts the home cook into the first rank at once. Therefore, we will study the first principles of bread-making here. The early and simple forms of bread were unleavened; these still survive in the oatcake and barley bannock of Scotland, the damper of the Australian bushman, the chuppattee of the Indian, and other peculiar cakes of peasant cookery. Leavened bread was first made by the Chinese, although it was also made by the Egyptians and came to the Greeks and Romans probably by way of Egypt. All bread was leavened until about the beginning of the nineteenth century, when leaven was superseded by the introduction of brewer’s yeast as a ferment—in its earlier form known as barm—then later mixed with other ingredients capable of producing the same effect of fermenta- tion and of making the liquid barm solid and portable, so forming what is still called “ German” yeast—a manufacture, however, carried on in our own country. There are additions, like the diastase of malt, added to bread by bakers to make the sponge rise in the shortest time possible and to increase the bulk of the dough, so that bread-making may

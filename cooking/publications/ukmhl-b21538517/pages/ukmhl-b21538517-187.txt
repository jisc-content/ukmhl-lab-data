BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRIES 171 soft. Short pastry should not be too much rolled, only sufficient to make an even crust. Baking- powder is added to short pastry to make it light, as only half the weight of shortening to flour is used. A good self-raising flour is really better for the purpose than baking-powder, as it is more even and reliable. Use very cold water for mixing, and forget not to work in a pinch of salt. Short crusts should be thick rather than thin. For Flaky Paste a little more weight of shortening is allowed, say, three-quarters to a pound of flour, but only a part of this is rubbed into the latter. And when the dough has been formed, with a beaten egg added to the water used, it is rolled out on a floured board into one thick sheet, and the rest of the shortening is spread over in thin flakes, the paste folded over again and rolled out once more, again folded and rolled quite thin. Lard makes the best flaky pastry. Puff Paste, on the other hand, requires equal, or very nearly equal, proportions of flour and shortening—the latter being either all butter or a mixture of butter and lard. A well is made in the centre of the flour, and a very little of the butter is finely chopped and mixed in this well with sufficient of the flour and water to form a “ sponge.” This is left in a cool place for twenty minutes. After this the rest of the flour and sufficient ice- water are used to work the whole into a ball of dough, which is kneaded like bread. This

CHAPTER I A SMALL KITCHEN It is one thing to work out a sum in Reduction on paper or slate—it is quite another thing to do it with tools and appliances, with money and materials. The young bride wha- comes to her new small home from a big family house, has first of all to • bring her ideas into keeping with her more limited surroundings, and to banish from her mind any idea of modelling her own household arrangements on the same lines as those followed in the bigger home with its greater possibilities. And what is not easy for the young bride, who starts with everything new and fresh, and with ambitions as bright as her pots and pans, is tenfold more difficult for the one who, as so constantly happens in this world, has to work out that sum in Reduc- tion through change of circumstances and loss of income. In each case, however, the start has to be made by bringing the mind into keeping with its surround- ings—looking at possibilities with a wise regard for impossibilities. Much can be achieved in spite of limitations, if set about in the right and sensible way.

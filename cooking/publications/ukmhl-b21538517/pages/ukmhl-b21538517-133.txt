CHAPTER V 117 VEGETABLES AND FRUIT The home cook who is modern and up-to-date in all her work cannot show her skill and wisdom in any surer way than in the manner in which she brings forward vegetables and fruit in her menus. As a people we English are considerable eaters of fruit, but small eaters of vegetables, except of greens and potatoes. We do not really appreciate vege- tables, that is the truth. A glimpse of a Continental market tells a very different story; the cleanliness and attractiveness of the vegetable displays make us marvel when we see them, and we notice, too, how much more variety there is to be seen. There are vegetables there of which we know not even the names, and even the old familiar sorts have a superior look about them. It is because the grower has known that his efforts would not be wasted if he did his best, and he does it. Now that we are reaping the result of the introduction of French gardening in England, it is high time that the everyday customer showed ability to appreciate what is done, by buying carefully yet freely, and by at least trying to cook well what is produced.

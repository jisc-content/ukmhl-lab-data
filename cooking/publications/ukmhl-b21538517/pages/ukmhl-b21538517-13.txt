V PREFACE This book is written specially for home cooks whose means are limited, with the hope of helping them to make the most of their limitations. It is also written in the hope of making it clear to all that successful cooking—by which is meant perfect cooking—is just as possible in the cottage as in the mansion; and to show that, however simple and economical the table may necessarily be, it may yet bear criticism from the culinary expert. The difficulties of home cooks are rarely if ever met by paying others to deal with them. They call for patience and study, for considerable power of invention and resource. But because they are big with importance on account of their bearing on the health of the family, and through the family upon national life, it behoves every home cook to deal with them intelligently and seriously. It is with this conception in mind that we have dealt with principles and reasons before giving directions and recipes, believing that, when prin- ciples are understood, any home cook may com- pile her own recipes.

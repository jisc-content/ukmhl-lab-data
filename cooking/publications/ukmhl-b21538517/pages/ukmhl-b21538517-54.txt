38 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK Salts, acids, and minerals are present to some extent in all the animal and vegetable foods, but sometimes a little supplementing becomes neces- sary, as when the taste indicates that more salt should be added to potatoes, and so on. We find sulphur in eggs, phosphates in fish, and minerals in most vegetables and some fruits. Thus it is easy to see why a mixed diet is the most rational one, provided that it be mixed with understanding. The visible results of right feed- ing are seen in firm muscle, pure blood, and that sufficiency of fat to make “the layer of wadding beneath the skin which rounds off the muscles and keeps the body warm,” as some one has described it; but there are other hardly less visible indications too, which are bright spirits, alertness and activity of mind, and equability of temper. Let us never forget, however, that the best food will not suffice to bring about these good results unless there is also given abundance of air for the lungs to feed upon, and this must be given by night as well as by day. Better stint in food than in air, although both are requisite for perfect nutrition. Bad ventilation in living rooms, insuffi- cient air in sleeping rooms, will bring on diseases of the internal organs, causing them to be unequal to their work of digesting any food, however good. It would be quite possible to enlarge on this subject until this little book became a text-book of physiology, but to do so would only weary the young home cook. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that in daily practice even the most

212 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK slices of onion, or, better still, small whole shallots, a few peeled mushrooms, some minced herbs and pepper and salt, and sufficient gravy or stock to cover all well. Leave to stew in the oven for fully an hour, or longer, and serve altogether. A GOULACHE For this rump steak should be taken, freed from all fat; about a pound will make enough for four persons. Cut the steak into small squares, rather less than an inch every way. Roll well in seasoned flour and pack into a stewpan with water enough to barely cover, and put in at the top a few rounds of carrot and one or two onions. Cover tightly and stew for well over an hour, then remove the carrot and onion and add to the gravy a little sharp sauce or mushroom ketchup. Serve from a deep dish, with boiled spaghetti or mashed potato in a separate dish. Boiled spaghetti—a fine maccaroni—is an ex- cellent accompaniment to stewed beef of any kind. It wants breaking into short lengths, dropping into boiling salted water, and cooking fully twenty minutes. BEEF MOULD {to be eaten cold) Mince finely, if possible using a mincing machine for the purpose, a slice of lean beef of fully a pound’s weight, then mix with this some rather fat ham also minced, a little chopped parsley and a few mushrooms, shallots and savoury herbs, with a teaspoonful of salt and half one of pepper.

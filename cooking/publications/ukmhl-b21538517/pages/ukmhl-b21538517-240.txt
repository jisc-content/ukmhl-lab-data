226 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK salt, and they are eaten either with or without a white sauce, to which grated cheese may or may not be added, according to taste. They are also served exactly like potatoes with the gravy of meat, and they make an excellent foundation for a white soup, and can be added to a stew of mutton. Asparagus in its season is justly esteemed a delicacy, and is valuable for its medicinal qualities. It should stand upright in a deep saucepan, as otherwise the heads cook before the rest is tender and are apt to drop off. Boil well, then drain and serve with pure butter dissolved, but not made into sauce, or serve cold with mayonnaise. Asparagus, when fully cooked, should yet preserve a certain crispness, therefore it must not be boiled too long. Many people spoil it by overboiling. It should be quite easy to handle when taken in the fingers, and should be served on a folded serviette so as to be thoroughly drained. Seakale is boiled and served exactly like aspara- gus, save that it can lie flat in the pan, the tops not being more tender than the rest of the stalk. It is usual to mask seakale with white sauce, but only salt should be added to this, as the delicate flavour of the vegetable must not be hidden. Sweet Potatoes or Yams are not very satisfactory as a vegetable, being rather pulpy and pasty, instead of dry and mealy like the ordinary potatoes. They are perhaps best to be baked or roasted in their skins and eaten with a spoon.

Where they are baked, they are done at the same time as the meat; where sautd, they are first boiled, then sliced and tossed in a hot frying-pan with chopped parsley sprinked over. The stuffing for the veal is, of course, made before- hand and the meat put ready for baking. The spinach is washed and put ready for boiling.

no THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK just mentioned. Of course, roast fillet or loin of veal is very excellent; but, to be paradoxical, it should not be roasted, but baked, and that only under protection of fat or greased paper or other shield, for veal is a very dry meat and needs much care to keep it from becoming drier. The round of veal is nearly always stuffed, the bone being removed and its place taken by a savoury stuffing, and the whole well covered with greased paper while it bakes through. When the round of veal is cooked in a piece in the casserole, it is improved by having a good-sized piece of fat bacon or salted pork put with it; a cut from the shoulder of veal so cooked is excellent. For boiling with rice the shank of veal gives the best results; for stewing the breast is most suitable. The latter, indeed, makes a delicious stew when cut into three-inch lengths and about one-inch width, these being laid in the casserole with pepper and salt and sufficient water to well cover, cooked gently for an hour and a half, adding half a bottle of capers to the gravy and filling up the casserole with new potatoes boiled, returning to the oven to cook another half-hour before serving. Veal braised in the casserole has for ideal accompaniment either spinach or sorrel cooked like spinach. With the veal should be put fat bacon or pork, very little fat being taken off the gravy, since spinach requires a rich gravy. A piece of veal cooked in this way would eat well cold if pressed down in the casserole under a weight, when the gravy would form a jelly round it.

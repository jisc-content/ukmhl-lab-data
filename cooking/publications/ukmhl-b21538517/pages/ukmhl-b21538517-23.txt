7 A SMALL KITCHEN The advantage of a copper in a small scullery is questionable; where there is laundry work done at home it is of course required, but unless needed for this the space occupied by the copper might be utilised to a better purpose. But if the copper must remain, because brought into occasional service, it can at other times be made into an extra table by having a separate flat top to cover it, as sometimes there is not room for any other table in the scullery. The ideal arrangement for a sink is for the glazed stoneware trough to be in the centre with water taps over it, the sloped shelf for draining plates, etc., at the left-hand side, and another broad shelf on the right-hand side, the spaces below each being made into cupboards, and the walls lined with glazed tiles. Thus in washing and drying crockery there is no occasion to take needless steps, and the whole space can be closed in with doors to resemble a wardrobe or closet when not in use. If the sink is placed immedi- ately in front of a window, as not infrequently is the case, the upper halves of these doors could be of ground glass to let the light through. In the small kitchen we cannot afford to lose our corner spaces. These can be filled in with cupboards which any home carpenter could make . out of plain deal, and then be painted to be in keeping with the rest of the woodwork of the kitchen. One such cupboard could have small shelves from floor to ceiling, and hold a current store of jams, marmalade, pickles, etc. Another

48 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK to moisten the surface, then to bring it near to a greater heat so that a crust shall form on the surface that will keep in the gravy of the meat while it is being cooked through. And as the heat should be applied on all sides evenly, a roasting jack or spit is made to revolve round and keep the joint continually moving. In Baking—too often confounded with roasting —the principle is that the oven shall be sufficiently hot at the beginning to subject the meat to the same shock of surprise which articles that are fried receive when they are immersed in boiling fat. An oven that is too “ slow,” that it is but poorly heated, dries the surface without bringing any crust upon it, and leaves the whole joint the same pale colour right through, or it will keep the bread or pastry from rising, and not allow it to become brown. While Roasting is a process of cooking by radiated heat, baking is a combination of radiated and air-conducted heat—where the oven is venti- lated. Properly-built bakers’ ovens are always ventilated, and hence whatever goes into them retains a pure taste; but the oven of the small range that is without ventilation will impart a flavour of iron, and often of stale fat, to whatever is put into it. An oven used for baking needs to be kept scrupulously clean, whereas a careless cook will too often allow it to become encrusted with fat, or the burnt juice of fruit pies, or stale crumbs. Washing out with hot water and soda (using a mop with a handle, or a brush) should be done at least once a

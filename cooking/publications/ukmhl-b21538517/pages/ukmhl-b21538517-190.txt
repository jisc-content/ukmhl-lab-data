174 the successful HOME COOK called a deflector; this throws down the heat on to the surface of whatever is near to it, and causes it to brown quickly. Pies, and especially small pastries, should be placed rather close up to this deflector at first, then afterwards removed to the lower shelf to finish cooking. If the crust is browned before you have reason to think it is cooked through, lower-the gas to reduce the heat. When making small open jam or cream tartlets it does not improve jam to cook it again, and when puff pastry forms the shell it is better to put a bit of soft bread into the centre of the tartlet, removing this and filling with jam after it is baked. A meringue of white of egg and sugar can be dropped on the top of the jam and the tartlets returned to the oven just long enough to set this, if especially nice tartlets are wanted. Lemon Cheesecakes are rounds of puff paste filled with lemon curd before baking; the curd can be made and kept in jars ready for use. One fresh lemon—the strained juice and grated rind—is allowed to three eggs and a quarter of a pound of butter, the whole being cooked together to a rich curd. For a Lemon Meringue Tart, if this curd was freshly made for the purpose, the whites of the eggs would be kept back and whisked stiff with sugar and piled on the top when the tart had finished baking, setting it back in the oven for just a moment or two. Such a tart should be made in one of large size, rather than in several small ones.

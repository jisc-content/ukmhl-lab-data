92 THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK a garnish, fry that also a second or two. Slices of fish fry well, and so do fillets and the smaller kinds of whole fish like whiting and flounders, sprats and whitebait. When drained these should be sprinkled with salt and pepper. Whitebait, after drying well, are rolled in a well-floured cloth to become coated, then dropped into a deep pan of fat into which the wire frying-basket fits. They require gentle shaking from time to time while they cook to keep them from sticking together, then drying in a hot oven before bringing to table. Smelts are another delicious small fish for serving fried, but they are big enough to dip in beaten egg and roll separately in crumb of bread. They are served on paper dâ€™oyleys, with thin slices of cut lemon, and eaten with brown bread and butter. For broiling, only such fish are suitable as can be split open down the back and the bone removed ; they are then oiled on both sides and laid on a grid and held over a clear fire till done. A few minutes suffices to broil fish over a clear fire. This method of cooking suits well the smaller mackerel, river trout, and herrings. Fish which boil well are salmon, turbot, halibut, cod, hake, brill, bream, and mackerel. Baking fish are halibut, gurnet, mackerel, cod, haddock, trout, sole, and mullet. For frying, all fish that will fillet, with soles, plaice, lemon sole, smelts, and sprats, whitebait, whiting, and flounders. For broiling we have fresh trout, mackerel, herrings, and, in some cases, soles.

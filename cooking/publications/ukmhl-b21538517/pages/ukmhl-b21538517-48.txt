THE SUCCESSFUL HOME COOK 32 small housekeeper. She is tempted to buy more things and things other than she really meant to buy; she pays dearer for them and always pays something for accommodation and convenience; she is often the recipient of stale goods and short weights; she is often charged with things she never had. The only cheap way of marketing is to go and choose for oneself, to pay ready-money, to see the weight, and insist upon knowing all about the purchase. This is the way the Con- tinental woman goes about her marketing; it is done early in the morning, and done as regularly as she makes her bed, without any fuss or dressing- up, and it is done with a basket on her own arm and without any idea of loss of dignity. Abroad very little household shopping is done after eleven oâ€™clock in the morning, and markets as a rule close at noon.

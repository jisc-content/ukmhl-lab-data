CHAPTER VI PUDDINGS AND SWEET DESSERTS BOILED PUDDINGS We will take first the most substantial varieties of puddings—those which have breadcrumbs or flour for their chief ingredient, which are boiled, steamed, or baked, and served with sauces, and which make a« great addition to the family menu, especially in winter-time. There is a goodly choice among these; but of nearly all it may be said that they are much improved by being made some time in advance, even the day before wanted, except in the case oDthose puddings into which self-raising flour enters, or baking-powder. BARONESS PUDDING Weigh out equal quantities of stoned and chopped raisins, flour, or breadcrumbs, say, a quarter of a pound of each; add a quarter of a pound of finely minced suet, and mix the whole with milk to a stiff paste. Put into a buttered pudding-mould and tie down with greased paper; the mixture should only three-parts fill the mould. Place this in a pan of boiling water, and let it boil or steam four hours. Serve with plain white sauce.

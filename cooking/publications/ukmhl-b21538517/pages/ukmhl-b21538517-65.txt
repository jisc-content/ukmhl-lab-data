METHODS OF COOKING 49 week, whether the oven be one belonging the range or that of a gas stove. In Boiling meat we have to consider whether our object is to cook the meat for eating, or to extract the juices from it for the sake of the liquor or soup we may make with it. If we are cooking the meat for its own sake, we use water in the same way as we use fire or oven heat; but if we want to extract the values of the meat, we require the water to act as a chemical agent or solvent. Thus, in practice, two degrees of boiling are considered: one that is real boiling, and the other that is only sim- mering. Boiling-point is 212° Fahrenheit or 100° Centigrade, and can be ascertained by the thermometer, although in common practice we know when water boils by its violent bubbling up and throwing off steam. As a piece of meat, or fish, intended to be eaten boiled is often bulky, to keep it at the boiling-point all the time would render it tough; but it is plunged into the water at this high temperature to begin with, in order that a crust may form on the outer surface to retain the juices, then it is withdrawn after a few minutes so that the ebullition shall be gentle, although still not much below the boiling degree. It needs to be kept thus, at what we may call just under boiling-point, for a considerable time, hence in reckoning the time to be allowed for cooking a joint by the boiling pro- cess, we allow twenty minutes to the pound, whereas a quarter of an hour is the rule for roasting. When, however, we wish to extract the goodness 4

LONDON: GOUBAUD AND SON, 39 & 40, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, W.C.I » r f % UNlVFRStTy LIBRAiiy LEEDSA 2 PREFACE HIS little volume must not be considered in anyway as a substitute for larger and well-known Cookery Books, the standard works on the subject of cookery for many years. It is more intended for beginners who require a book to which they can instantly refer whilst preparing a dish, and which tells them in the fewest possible words the ingredients they will require in its preparation, the quantity of each ingredient, the process or processes through which it has to go before it can be mixed with the other ingredients, and the order in which these processes have to follow each other. No attempt is made to treat cooking from a scientific point of view; the object has been to provide a handy, practical, concise book, easily referred to, and in which it is not necessary to read through the whole of the recipe in order to find the particular point that requires the moment’s study. The tabular system followed obviates any necessity of this kind : the young student of cookery looks down the columns, notes the nature and amount of the ingredie'nts required, collects these round her, and then sees what has to be done with each one. The quantities have been given as accurately as possible, and should be carefully observed ; at the same time, the cook should note the taste of the individuals for whom she exercises her art, and alter the seasonings and flavouring of the dishes as she thinks expedient in order to render theIV PREFACE. food thoroughly palatable. A little experience will soon give the necessary skill forjudging such matters. The recipes given include all those usually required by English middle-class families, and to these have been added the recipes of a number of French, German, and Italian dishes, all good in their several ways, easy of preparation, and likely to be acceptable as providing a little agreeable change in the rather limited menu of the ordinary English cuisine. More recipes are given for soups and vegetables than are usually found in English cookery books, for these two very nutritious, economicrd, and delicious branches of cookery are generally too much overlooked in England. A great number of recipes are also given for “little dishes,” made either from fresh meat or from such as has been already cooked. The preparation of these requires care and intelligence, but without a due exercise of these two qualities neither cooking, nor any other art, is likely to be pursued with success.CONTENTS SECTION PREFACE METHODS OF COOKING...

TO CASTING is the simplest and most generally adopted way of cooking fresh meat; it may be done in the oven, or before the fire on a spit, or suspended from a bottle-jack—most people prefer this method, as tending less to deteriorate the flavour of the meat. For a large joint the fire should be strong and even ; for a smaller joint it should be brisk—in either case the length of the fire should be a little longer than that of the meat, so that the ends of the joint may be roasted equally with the centre. Large joints are improved if they are allowed to lie in the dripping pan near the fire until warmed through, before they are hung up to roast. Great care must be used in roasting meat on a spit not to run this through the best part of the joint, as the gravy escapes by the holes made by the spit— the same remark holds good with skewers: string should be used as much as possible instead of skewers, to prevent the loss of gravy. The time generally allowed for roasting is a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat, and the joint is tender in proportion with the slowness of the roasting. There are, however, some points to be noted with regard to time that should be remembered; fresh meat takes longer to roast than does meat that has been hung for some time; young meat requires less cooking than that of older animals ; and fat meat takes longer than lean meat, which should be covered with buttered paper before roasting, to prevent burning and dryness. Small—and especially thin—joints may be put down to aMYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. vm brisk fire, which causes the fibres to contract and prevents the gravy from escaping. Large joints should not be put close to the fire at first, but gradually brought nearer to it, so that the heat may penetrate to the centre of the joint without scorching and burning the outside of it. Salt may be sprinkled over the joint while it lies in the pan before the fire, or when it is partially cooked : basting should be continued the whole time the joint is before the fire. It should be sheltered from draughts while roasting, and when the steam rises from the joint it is time to take it off the spit. The outside of a well-cooked joint is well browned, but not burnt: the inside is filled with natural gravy, the juice of the meat. Some joints, such as a fillet of veal, have flour dredged over them and browned, just before taking the meat from the fire. The cook must consult the taste of the family as to the amount of roasting that is required : veal, pork, and lamb should always be thoroughly done, but many people prefer beef and mutton rather underdone. To secure great tender- ness, keep the joint at a distance from the fire, and allow half an hour to each pound of meat, and put it closer to the fire to brown it for the last half hour before serving. Roasted in this way the joint will be tender and thoroughly done. BAKING. The oven is now often used for roasting meat instead of cooking the joint before the open fire: to many people, however, meat cooked in this way is unpalatable, and, except for its convenience, baking cannot be recommended as a substitute for roasting. Meat is baked in a tin dish, but raised on a stand so that it may not rest in the gravy that drips from it. To prevent it from being dried or burnt, sheets of buttered paper mayIX METHODS OF COOKING. be skewered over it, and potatoes or a Yorkshire pudding may be baked in the dish under the meat. The oven is, however, exceedingly well adapted for many methods of slow cooking when regular heat is required. Stews of m.eat, fish, or vegetables may all be cooked in the oven, either in earthen jars or in stewpans—rice baked in this way, with a proper amount of liquid and a little meat or fish, is excellent; and stock and soup can be as well prepared in the oven as on the fire. Many kinds of fish are nicer when baked than dressed in any other way; fresh cured hams may be covered with paste and then baked, and will be found very tender and of fine flavour—in fact, any process of cooking that is done in a closed vessel, and that requires gentle and regular heat, may be safely entrusted to the oven. For baking pastry the oven should be moderately hot to raise the paste, but not hot enough to burn it before it is cooked through. When the pastry has been put in, the oven door must be closed, and not opened again until the paste is thoroughly set: if the heat is checked, or allowed to escape, the pastry will fall and become tough. Raised pies require a much hotter oven than is needed for fruit tarts : it is a good plan to heat the oven by burning wood in it for an hour or so before the pie is put in. Resi- nous or scented wood must not, however, be used for this purpose. Meat pies, when sufficiently browned, should be allowed to stand on the top of the oven for an hour or more, that the meat in them may become thoroughly cooked. The paste may be covered with white paper, to preserve it from blacks or dust and from burning. Baked milky puddings, such as rice, sago, custard, etc., require a very gentle oven ; but puddings of the batter kind require more heat to raise them.MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. X Baked puddings that resemble a souffle, and that have frothed white of eggs mixed with them the moment before they are put in the oven, require a moderate heat, and should be sent to table the instant they are taken out of the oven. A sheet of white paper placed over a pudding, when it is set and slightly browned, will preserve it from burning or from becoming too dark a colour. Large cakes require a well-sustained - heat, or they will not be baked through: when done they should be gently taken out of the moulds and put near the door of the oven to dry the surface, and then laid on their sides on a sieve to cool. Small cakes and gingerbread must be baked in a slow oven, but light cakes, macaroons, ratafias, etc., require rather more heat. Cake tins should be well buttered, and lined with paper. BOILING. The time required for boiling meat varies with the size and nature of the joint, and also with the kind of meat: the method of cooking also varies slightly. Fresh meat is generally put into cold water, in the proportion of a quart of water to each pound of meat, and allowed to come gradually to the boil; the pot is then drawn aside, and the meat simmers gently until it is done. It is a good plan to place a reversed plate or dish at the bottom of the pot, to prevent the meat from resting on this and possibly adhering to it. Another way of boiling joints of fresh meat is to put them at once into boiling water, and when they have remained in it a minute to add cold water until the tempe- rature is reduced to tepid. After this the heat is again increased, and the joint is allowed to simmer until tender. This plan is said to keep the gravy in the meat withoutMETHODS OF COOKING. xi hardening it. Large joints require from fifteen to twenty minutes boiling to each pound of meat; smaller joints take from twelve to fifteen minutes to each pound; lamb and veal take longer than mutton or beef; a chicken takes twenty minutes ; a fowl thirty or forty minutes; a turkey from an hour and a half to two hours, depending on the size; rabbits require a great deal of boiling in plenty of water, nearly or quite an hour and three-quarters. All salt meat should be soaked in cold water for at least two hours before it is required for cooking, and well washed and dried. It is put into cold water, which is allowed to come gradually to the boil, and the pot is then drawn away from the fire so that the meat can simmer gently until done. Some people consider it a good plan to let the meat boil fast for ten minutes before drawing it aside to simmer; this boiling preserves the juices, and it does not last long enough to harden the meat. The time usually allowed is a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat, but this, although suffi- cient for small joints, is not always enough for large ones. Bacon, for instance, takes much longer to boil than salt beef, ham, or tongue. All boiled meat or poultry that is to be eaten hot should be taken out of the pot as soon as it is done—it will become sodden and flavourless if left too long in the water. Meat that is to be eaten cold, such as tongue or ham, should be allowed to cool in the liquor it has been boiled in ; rolled tongue and pressed spice beef are, of course, e.xceptions, as they must be moulded while hot. The meat should always be covered with water, although it is not desirable that there should be a great depth of water above the joint. Fast boiling will entirely spoil the meat, and render it hard, tough, and a bad colour. The scum must be taken off as it rises, but, except when skim- ming is necessary, the lid should be left on the pot, and theXU MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. heat, which need not be great for simmering, should be even and uninterrupted. In boiling poultry or white meats, a piece of bread with- out crust, and a little butter or beef suet, may be added to the water to soften it, and to keep the colour and improve the flavour of the joint. STEAMING. Steaming is often preferred to boiling for some kinds of food, such as potatoes, rice, vegetables, macaroni, fish, and sweet puddings. The steamer fits into the top of a sauce- pan made for the purpose, and any article that has no strong flavour may be boiled in the water contained in the sauce- pan, and which provides the steam for the steamer. The food to be steamed is prepared as for boiling, and the lid of the saucepan must be firmly closed to prevent the escape of the steam. Steaming is an excellent way of warming cold puddings and meat, as it entirely preserves their original flavour. FRYING. There are two chief points on which the success of fr}'- ing depends ; one is to have a sufficiency of fat to cover the articles to be fried, and the other is to have this boiling before anything is put into it. No food can be properly fried in a thin layer of warm grease ; there must be plenty of it, and it must be at the right degree of heat. A deep pan is therefore necessary for frying any but very flat objects, such as soles; and an admirable plan is to put the articles to be fried into a kind of wire-work basket, which is dipped into the pan of boiling fat, and then taken out with the fried articles in it when these are cooked. If wellMETHODS OF COOKING. xiii covered with the fat, they are fried on both sides at once, and do not require turning, or any handling or touching, until they are removed from the basket. Butter, oil, lard, dripping, and clarified suet are all used for frying; of these, lard, dripping, and clarified suet are most used in general cooking. Olive oil answers extremely well for frying fish, and, if strained and carefully kept, can be used several times. Fat, also, may be used more than once for meat, if carefully strained and kept quite fresh. Butter is generally used only in frying vegetables for stews, when it forms part of the gravy, and for light and delicate dishes. No fat that has been used for one kind of food should ever be used for any other kind, as it invariably con- tracts the flavour of the articles fried in it. To test the heat of the boiling fat wait till it has left off bubbling, then dip your finger in water and shake it over the pan; if the fat crackles and sputters the heat is right, and the articles can be put in. The fat used must be per- fectly fresh, clean, and free from salt, otherwise the food will be spoilt in flavour and colour. All fried food must be carefully drained before it is sent to table; it should be so dry that it scarcely leaves a trace of grease on the cloth or paper on which it is served. Omelets should be fried in a special enamelled pan kept for the purpose, and never used for any other kind of food. The butter in which they are fried must be boiling hot, but not brown, or it will spoil the colour of the omelet. BROILING. The success of broiling depends almost entirely on the brightness and clearness of the fire: there should be a steady glow at the top, without smoke or flames. MuchXIV MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. can be done to improve the lire, if it is not clear, by sprink- ling a handful of salt on it. The gridiron should be perfectly clean and polished: gridirons with fluted bars and a receptacle for the gravy answer best. When hot the bars should be rubbed with suet or grease, to prevent the meat from sticking to them : chalk is used instead of grease for fish, and the gridiron is held in a sloping position over the fire. No salt should be sprinkled on the meat before broiling, as it has the effect of bringing out the gravy, which falls into the fire and is wasted. The meat, if thick, must be gradually heated through by being kept at a little distance above the fire, otherwise the outside will be burnt while the inside is nearly raw : thin meat may be broiled more briskly. Steaks, chops, and all broiled articles should be frequently turned with a pair of tongs: the holes made by a fork let the gravy out. Meat that has been dipped in egg and bread crumbs should also be dipped in clarified butter before broiling; cutlets may be seasoned a little with pepper and salt, and then brushed over with oil or butter—they are very good cooked in this way. Fish may be wrapped in buttered paper for broiling. STEWING. Fresh meat for stewing may be first gently boiled in the stewpan with the vegetables and stock, and then skimmed, but sometimes the meat is put into boiling stock or water: at other times cold water or stock, sufficient only to provide the necessary gravy in either case, is poured over it. In French stews the meat and vegetables are browned in butter and flour in the stewpan, the hot stock is then addedMETHODS OF COOKING. XV with the seasoning and other ingredients, the lid is put on and the stewpan is placed where it will have slow but well- regulated heat, until it is ready to serve. The regulation of the heat is an important point in all stews, as the flavour of the dish depends almost entirely on the care that is taken to keep it steady and even, never too fast nor too slow, for an error in either direction will destroy the flavour, and either harden the meat or leave it insufficiently cooked. Once fairly started a stew should be interfered with as little as possible ; even raising the lid checks the process of cooking, and the fragrant steam that escapes is so much lost from the flavour. Good stock or gravy is absolutely necessary to make a rich and well flavoured stew; water or thin stock can only be used for Irish stews and similar homely family dishes. Stewing is the most economical process in cooking, as nothing is put into a stew that is not eaten, unless it is perhaps the bunch of parsley and herbs put in to flavour the gravy. No method of cooking is more easy, yet none is so often a failure, chiefly because the gravy is too thin and flavourless, and the stew is allowed to boil at a gallop, when it should simmer very gently. When cold meat is to be served as a stew, the gravy must be first made and simmered with the vegetables, seasoning, flavouring, etc., until it is of the right consist- ence ; any thickening it requires should be put in at the very first stage; the addition of flour towards the end of the cooking should be avoided as much as possible, as it does not mix well, and often gives the gravy a raw flavour. If it is necessary to thicken the gravy a little more, this should be done by adding a little butter kneaded with flour, or a little prepared white or brown roux. The gravy when thoroughly cooked is strained, if necessary, into another saucepan, and the meat, cut in neat slices and perfectlyXVI MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. free from gristle and skin, is then heated in the simmering gravy, which must never be allowed to boil. Boiling will infallibly harden the meat and destroy the flavour of the stew, which should be served as soon as the meat is thoroughly hot. Saucepans should not be used for stewing: a stewpan, with a well-fitting lid, is the only vessel fit for the purpose. Meat and vegetables that require browning before they are stewed can be fried in an ordinary stewpan, or in a deep frying pan or saute pan. Good stews can, however, be made by putting all the ingredients in an earthen jar with a well-fitting top, and putting this in a slow oven to stew gently till done. The lid of the stewpan or jar may be rendered air-tight by put- ting some flour-and-water paste over the opening, and removing this only when the stew is cooked. BRAISING. A braising-pan is required for this method of cooking joints, etc. This is a large or small, deep, oblong vessel of copper, with a tinned lining like a stewpan, having a very deep lid or cover, with an upright ledge all round it, to keep in the hot coals or embers that are burnt on it, to give the necessary heat above and below the article cooked. Meat and some kinds of poultry, turkeys, fowls, game, etc., are frequently braised ; slices of fat bacon are placed in the pan, and the meat is covered with more slices before it is put in. Onions, herbs, and sometimes vegetables are added ; bones and trimmings of meat are put in to add richness to the gravy, a sufficient quantity of good stock is poured over it, with any seasoning that is needed, the cover is put on, hot coals are placed on this, and the pan is placedxvii METHODS OF COOKING. where its contents will simmer or stew very gently for two or three hours. When the meat is done it is taken out of the pan and kept hot, and the gravy is strained into a basin ; to get rid of the fat plunge the basin of gravy into cold water, and when the fat coagulates at the top take it off. Then boil the gravy quickly until it thickens, and pour it over the meat ; if very thick, brush it over and put the meat in the oven for a few minutes to form a glaze. Delicate kinds of meat are covered with a sheet of buttered paper, to save them from being burned by the fire on the lid. GLAZING. Glaze is a thick, but clear brown gravy, produced by the continued boiling of an ordinary good made gravy until it is reduced to a third or fourth part of the original quantity, and is about the same consistence as the best treacle—when cold it becomes a jelly. Glaze is used for brushing over made dishes, and many that are eaten cold—ham, tongue, boned turkey, etc. When two or three coats of glaze are needed, as is some- times the case, each coat must be allowed to cool before the next one is put on. When cold they form a thick, brown smooth jelly all over the article glazed. LARDING. The best fat bacon should be used for larding, and slices of this, free from lean and rind, are cut into strips of equal size and thickness. For poultry, game, and small joints the strips of bacon are two inches long and about the eighthMYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. will of an inch square; when the larcloons are required for large joints, or have to be taken right through the meat, the strips are longer and nearly half an inch square. Small lardoons on the breasts of birds, or on the upper surface of the meat, should be put in very regularly in intersecting lines, and at equal distances apart. To insert the lardoons, secure one end in the larding needle, and take up with the point as much of the meat to be larded as will keep the strip firm ; draw the needle through and the bacon with it, but leave the two ends out —these should be of the same length—and when the lard- ing is finished tlie meat should resemble a cake stuck with almonds. For larding or daubing the inside of meat, the bacon is rolled in seasoning before it is inserted: a large larding needle is used, and the strips are drawn right through the meat. Larding is a great improvement to meat or poultry of a dry nature. S Y R U P-M A K I N G. The best lump sugar should be used for making syrups, candies, and caramel ; coarser sugar is less easily clarified, and there is more waste in boiling it. The sugar is broken in large lumps into the preserving pan, and a pint of water is allowed to each pound of sugar for syrups, or about a third of a pint of water if the sugar is to be candied. To clarify this half the white of one egg is enough for six pounds of sugar. Beat the white of egg to a light froth, alone first, then add it to the water and beat the two together. When well mixed pour the greater part of the water on to the sugar, and let this stand until dissolved ; stir well, put the pan onMETHODS OF COOKING. XIX the fire, and let the syrup boil for five minutes without disturbing it. Take the pan off the fire, let it stand two minutes, and then skim carefully and thoroughly. Put the pan back on the fire, and when the syrup begins to boil pour in a little of the water that was left over. Repeat the skimming until the syrup is quite clear, and then strain through muslin into a clean pan to be boiled again. There are several degrees of boiling sugar which may be learnt most accurately by means of a syrometer, but which may be judged of with a considerable degree of correctness by the ordinary thumb and finger test. The first stage is that of a thin syrup; if the finger is dipped in water and then in the liquid, and pressed against the thumb and quickly withdrawn, the syrup will form short threads that snap directly. Another five or ten minutes of rapid boiling will bring it to the second stage of a thick syrup, and the threads may then be drawn out to a great length without breaking. Long threads will also fall from the skimmer when this is raised. In the ne.xt two stages the syrup forms bubbles on the surface in boiling, small at first and then large ; if it is intended to make barley sugar or caramel the flavouring of lemon juice must now be added, but for candying the syrup is simply stirred until it rises in white foam almost to the top of the pan. It must now be taken out instantly and put on dishes, or it will resolve itself into a powder that will lequire more water and reboiling. Stirring is necessary in making barley-sugar, after the lemon juice is put in, which is at the rate of a dessert-spoonful of strained lemon- juice to three pounds of sugar. To test the barley-sugar, drop a little from the ladle or skimmer into a basin of cold water, take it out at once, and if it snaps clean and crisp between the teeth it is done, and must be taken off the fire immediately.XX MYRA’S COOKERY BOOK. Caramel is the last stage of syrup making; the sugar becomes a dark yellow colour, and emits a strong odour. The pan must be drawn away from the fire, and a little water thrown into it. In making orange-flower or cocoa-nut candy, these are thrown into the boiling syrup after it has been clarified and skimmed, and when it is very thick and white. It is then stirred until it rises in a mass, when it must be taken out immediately and laid on sheets of fine white paper. There is no great difficulty in making syrups and candies, but they require great care and constant watching, as if left on the fire a moment too long the syrup may be entirely spoilt, and be either wasted or require re-boiling. PRESERVING. In preserving fruit the pan containing it should at first be subjected to gentle heat, until the sugar is melted; the heat may then be increased until the boiling point is reached. Steady, regular heat must then be continued the whole time, together with constant stirring, or the fruit will burn and the preserve be rendered uneatable. The pots when filled must be left until they are stone cold before covering. The best way to do this is, first, to lay on the j"am a round of tissue paper the exact size of the jar, and press it down. A second round of tissue paper, cut larger than the jar, is dipped on one side in beaten white of egg, laid over the top, and pressed down round the rim. The white of egg on the inner side will make the paper adhere firmly to the jar, and the top, when dry, will have the consistence of parchment.MYRA’S COOKERY BOOK. SECTION I.—SOUPS.

Take care not to break the gall bladder, if you do, it will entirely spoil the flavour of the bird by giving it a bitter taste which no washing wull remove. Do not break the gut joining the gizzard either, lest the inside should become gritty.MYRA'S COOKERY ROOK. i6o TO TRUSS A TURKEY— Q. Wipe the inside quite clean with a wet cloth. 10.

The number of eggs used for an omelet should never exceed twelve, as a thick omelet is far less delicate than a smaller one. The omelet pan must be perfectly clean and never used for any other purpose. The eggs are best when beaten with a fork, but they should not be beaten for more than a minute or two, otherwise they become thin, and do not set well. Omelets are much lighter if a few small pieces of butter are beaten up with the eggs, or added to the beaten eggs immediately before frying. The butter in the pan must be quite hot, but not coloured, before the eggs are put in. All kinds of vegetables, cold meat, poultry, game, fish, macaroni, etc., •can be added to omelets to flavour them; they must first be broken or cut in small pieces and lightly fried in butter. 21.-EGG CHEESE, or Order.

It should be light and yet firm; if it is too heavy add the beaten white of an egg, if, on the contrary, it swells in the water and is limp when taken out, add a little milk to the mixture before poaching any more. 52.-CALFS LIVER FORCEMEAT.

As the heat of your oven must be regulated by what you intend to bake, the following rules should be carefully attended to:— 1. Light paste requires a moderate oven, but not too slow, as that will deprive it of the light appearance it should have, and too quick an oven will catch and burn it, without giving it time to rise. 2. Tarts that are iced require a slow oven, or the ice will be brown before the paste is properly baked. 3. Raised pies must have a quick oven, and be well closed up, or the pie will fall in at the sides; and it should have no water put in till just before you put it in the oven, or the crust will look sodden. l.-CRISP PASTE FOR TARTS. 1. Mix I oz. of loaf sugar beaten and sifted, with i lb. of fine flour, aiid make into a stiff paste with a gill of boiling cream or milk. 2. Work 3 oz. of butter into it. 3. Roll it very thin and make your tarts or pie-crust. 4. Ice your paste by beating the white of an egg a little, and rubbing it over the paste with a feather. 2.-RICH PUFF PASTE. 1. Rub a pound of butter very fine into a quarter of a peck of flour. 2. Make it into a light p-aste with cold water, just stiff enough to work it. 3. Roll it out to the thickness of a five-shilling piece, and put a layer of butter all over it. 4. Sprinkle on a little flour, double it up, and roll it out again. 5. Double it and roll it out seven or eight times, when it will be fit for all sorts of pies and tarts that require a puff paste. 3.—LIGHT PASTE FOR TARTS. 1. Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth, and mix it with as much water as will inake J lb. of flour into a tolerably stiff paste. 2. Roll it out very thin; lay 3 oz. of butter in thin pieces upon it and dredge It with a little more flour. 3. Roll it up tight, then roll it out again, and continue until * lb. each of butter and flour be used. 4. Cut It into square pieces, and make your tarts. This will require a quicker oven than crisp paste. \ 2MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. 4.-SUET CRUST, I, Shred 10 oz. suet and chop fine, and mix it with i lb. flour, and water into a stiff paste. 5.-DRIPPING PASTE. r. Boil the dripping in a good quantity of water for 4 or 5 minutes to take the strength off it, then use instead of butter according to the preceding receipts. 6.-AMERICAN PUFF PASTE. 1. Work 4 lb. of butter into i lb. of flour until it is like sand. 2. Take 2 tea spoonsful of cream of tartar, and i tea spoonful of carbonate of soda, rub them through a sieve and add them to the flour. 3. Add enough cold water to bind and work it smooth. 4. Roll the paste to 4 inch thick. 5. Spread J lb. of butter over, then fold it up and roll it out again. 6. Repeat No. 5 twice till you have used i lb. of flour. 7. Fold and roll for the last time. 7.-PASTE FOR MEAT PIES. 1. Work I lb. of butter into 2 lbs. of flour, until it crumbles. 2. Add a small teaspoonful of salt. 3. Beat up the yolks of 4 eggs with half-a-pint of cold water. 4. Strain and mix with the flour to a firm paste. 5. Roll it out to the required thickness. 8.-FRENCH PUFF PASTE. 1. Put I lb. of flour on the paste board, and make a hole in the centre. 2. Put 4 teaspoonful of salt, and ij wine glassful of water into the hole. 3. Work the flour in with the right hand, and add another wine glassful of water gradually with the left hand. 4. . Work the paste till it is quite smooth and does not stick to the board or the fingers. 5. Make the paste into a ball, and roll and flatten it with the hands. 6. Cover it with a cloth, and put it aside in a very cool place for 4 hour. In hot weather stand it over ice. 7. Flour the board and put the paste on it, then roll it into an oblong shape. 8. Put in the middle J lb. of firm, well washed and squeezed butter.PASTRY. 277 FRENCH PUFF PASTE—(continued). 9. In summer the butter should be kept on ice, till wanted. 10. Fold ihe ends of the paste over the butter, and form a square mass. 11. Flatten it again into an oblong shape, and fold it in three from the ends. 12. Let it stand 10 minutes. 13. Repeat this folding and flattening 6 times in summer, and 7 times in winter, always letting it stand 10 minutes between whiles. 14. Flour the board lightly each time. 15. After the last time of folding, let it stand 5 minutes, and it is then ready for use. 9.-GERMAN TASTE, for fruit tarts. Order. Ingredients. Quantities. Method. I... Flour ijlb. ...

To glaze meat pies beat up the yolk of an egg only, or the yolk and white together if a lighter colour be desired, and brush over the paste with a paste brush before baking.279 PASTRY. 14.-TO ICE PASTRY, Moisten the paste before baking with cold water, and sprinkle finely powdered sugar over it. Another way is to take the tart from the oven when nearly baked, brush it with frothed white of egg, sprinkle sifted sugar over it and a few drops of cold water, and put it back in the oven for a minute or two to set. 15.-GAME PIE.

Simmer the calfs’ feet gently for several hours, strain the liquor through a sieve and let it get cold. When cold take off the fat and put the jelly back on the fire, adding to it the strained juice of one lemon ; take off the scum when the jelly begins to boil. Beat up the whites of two or three eggs in a basin with a little water, take the jelly off the fire, stir it quickly with one hand and with the other pour in the beaten whites of egg very suddenly. Put the saucepan back on the fire at once and the moment it begins to boil pour in a glass of cold water and let it boil up again. Strain it at once through the jelly bag, and repeat this two or three times if necessary. If the jelly is not required immediately let it simmer gently on a slow fire, until it is sufficiently reduced without boiling, then pour it into an earthen jar and keep it in a cool place. It will keep good for some time.CAKES AND BISCUITS. 335 SECTION XVII.—CAKES AND BISCUITS. mi - - ■ —■ ■■ .-I — l.-RICH CAKE. Order. Ingredients. Quantities. Method. I... Currants 34 lbs. ...

A little cinnamon may be added to flavour the pickle, if liked, but it should be used in very small quantities. REMARKS ON PICKLING. The vinegar used for pickling should be of the best kind and greatest strength, and boiled in stone jars in preference to saucepans. All vegetables and other ingredients should be thoroughly dry before they are put into the vinegar, and if this becomes thick, as is sometimes the case, it should be poured off the pickles, boiled up again and then once more poured over them. It is most important that all pickle jars should be air tight, and that when pickles are removed from the large jars to smaller ones for use, a perfectly dry wooden spoon should be used for the purpose. The pickles left in the large jar must be covered with vinegar, or they will spoil.

In ordinary cases the only suitable food for young infants is milk. So soon, however, as some solid addition to the liquid food becomes desirable, there is nothing better for the purpose than BROWN AND POLSON'S CORN FLOUR. Its principal functon is to supply h^ If also contributes to the formation of fat, so essential to life at all stages, but especially to the earlie'r. BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR FOR THE FAMILY TABLE. In the hands of an accomplished cook there is no known limit to the variety of delicate'and palatable dishes which may be produced from BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR. It is equally susceptible of plain and simple treatment for ordinary domestic purposes, and one of its chief recommendations is the facility with which it may be prepared. Boiled with milk, and with or without the addition of sugar and flavouring, it may be ready for the table within fifteen minutes; or, poured into a mould and cooled, it becomes, in the course of an hour, a Blanc-mange, which, served with fresh or preserved fruit, will be acceptable at any meal. Add sultanas, raisins, marmalade, or jam of any kind, and in about the same time it is made into an excellent Baked Pudding. To which may be added:—Take care to boil with milk, when so required, for not less THAN EIGHT minutes. BROm & POISON'S CORN FLOUR • FOR THE SICK-ROOM. The properties of BROWN AND POLSON’S CORN FLOUR are identical with those of arrowroot, and it is in every respect equal to the costliest qualities of that article. The uses of arrowroct in the sick room are not only matter of tradition, but of every-day experience, and there can be but few persons who are not acquainted with its uses as an important ally to medical treatment. BROWN AND POLSON’S CORN FLOUR claims to serve the same purposes, with at least equal acceptance and at considerably less cost, and therefore offers the facility of freer use to a larger public. It has received from medical and scientific authorities the highest testimonials to its purity and serviceableness ; it is largely used in Hydropathic and other Institu- tions throughout the Kingdom, and its export to all foreign parts has long given it a worl^-wide reputation. NOTE.—Purchasers should insist on beine: supplied with BROWN AND POLSON’S CORN FLOUR. Inferior kinds, asserting fictitious claims, are being offered for the sake of extra profit.HEALTH AND PERSONAL ATTENTION. {See Myra’s Answers in “Myra's Journal.’’) EXTRACT FROM TOILET LIST PHILIP H. MASON, IJljannntcutinrl (fljcmist, anb (Cljcmist to tbc ^arrisoit, " 25, HIGH STREET, GOSPORT. The entire list (containing some eighty preparations) will he sent by return post, on the receij^t of stamped address. NOTICE.—All articles in this List admit of Postal Transit, and will be delivered free per post at the prices marked, secure from observation, and carefully packed. The immense number of postal applications which have followed Myra’s ” esteemed notices of a few of Mr. Mason’s Preparations, show that there are large numbers of ladies who, in the country, are remote from a| first-class pharmacy, or who, in towns, find it inconvenient to go or send to their immediate neighbours for such articles as Hair Restorers, Cosmetiques, Depilatories, Corn Plasters, and the thousand-and-one toilet requisites and medicinal remedies in daily use. The want thus shown, this List is in some measure intended to supply.

Its effects in im- proving the complexion, and softening and dealing the skin, are wonderful. 3s. per case. SULPHUR SOAP (for the hair).—The natural colour of the hair is due to an organic pigment, into the composition of which sulphur and iron largely enter. It is believed that in many cases grey hair is due solely to a deficiency in this natui'al secretion of sulphur. In such cases the sulphur may be supplied to the hair glands by occasionally washing the hair and scalp with the above soap. It is most particularly recommended that in cases of incipient greyness this should be tried before artificial colour restorers are resorted to. It is also the best soap for cleansing the hair applying any dye or colour restorer, as it greatly quickens and enhances their action. It is also of great service for washing the skin in many cases of eruption and skin disease. Is. 3d. THE COLLURION.—A fiuid compounded on strictly chemical and physiological principles. It accomplishes its purpose of restoring the hair to its pristine hue by its peculiar action on those vessels which secrete its colouring matter, the tempo- rary derangement of which, caused eitlier by accident or disease, leads to a suspen- sion of their functions, and hence pre- mature greyness ensues. It must be home in mind that tlie action of the Collurion, being natural, is gradual, and therefore all persons using it must not expect the change to be sudden; on the contrary, it will, according to the natui-e of the case, take more or less time, but when once restored, an occasional application will preserve the colour to any ago. An addi- tional advantage of the Collunon over all dyes C'Uisists in its requiring no pomade or oil to be used with it, and its action on the skin, instead of being in- jurious, is positively beneficial. 2s. Cd. per case. COMPLEXION PILLS.—Specially adapted to produce a healthy action of the skin and a clear complexion. If used in con- junction with certain easy rules of diet, tlieir eifect is rapid and marvellous. Is, 3d., 2s, lOd. per box.

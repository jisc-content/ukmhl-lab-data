Hang it on a hook and draw out the strings from the thigh. Cut the neck off close to the back, but leave the crop-skin lon<T^ enough to turn over the back. ° Remove the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and the gut at the throat end. Cut off the vent, remove the gut, take a crooked wire and pull out the gizzard, and the liver will easily follow. Take care not to break the gall bladder, if you do, it will entirely spoil the flavour of the bird by giving it a bitter taste which no washing wull remove. Do not break the gut joining the gizzard either, lest the inside should become gritty.

Large joints should not be put close to the fire at first, but gradually brought nearer to it, so that the heat may penetrate to the centre of the joint without scorching and burning the outside of it. Salt may be sprinkled over the joint while it lies in the pan before the fire, or when it is partially cooked : basting should be continued the whole time the joint is before the fire. It should be sheltered from draughts while roasting, and when the steam rises from the joint it is time to take it off the spit.

Some joints, such as a fillet of veal, have flour dredged over them and browned, just before taking the meat from the fire. The cook must consult the taste of the family as to the amount of roasting that is required : veal, pork, and lamb should always be thoroughly done, but many people prefer beef and mutton rather underdone. To secure great tender- ness, keep the joint at a distance from the fire, and allow half an hour to each pound of meat, and put it closer to the fire to brown it for the last half hour before serving.

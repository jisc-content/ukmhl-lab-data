Have the joint boned. Pound all together in a mortar, and ► rub it into the beef well on both sides. Turn it every day and rub it well for 8 days. Take it out of the pickle, wash it and wipe it dry. Sprinkle all over the beef, and roll it up very tight. Put a coarse cloth round it, and tie it up tight with tape. Boil it in a large copper of water. If it be a large collar it will take 6 hours, but a small one will be done in 5 hours. Take it out and put it in a press till cold, or, if you have no press, put it between two boards with heavy weights upon it. Garnish the dish. O

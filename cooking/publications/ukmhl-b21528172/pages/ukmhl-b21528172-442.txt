The vinegar used for pickling should be of the best kind and greatest strength, and boiled in stone jars in preference to saucepans. All vegetables and other ingredients should be thoroughly dry before they are put into the vinegar, and if this becomes thick, as is sometimes the case, it should be poured off the pickles, boiled up again and then once more poured over them. It is most important that all pickle jars should be air tight, and that when pickles are removed from the large jars to smaller ones for use, a perfectly dry wooden spoon should be used for the purpose. The pickles left in the large jar must be covered with vinegar, or they will spoil. FINIS.

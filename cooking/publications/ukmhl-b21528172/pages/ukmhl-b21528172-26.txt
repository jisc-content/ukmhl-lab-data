XX MYRAâ€™S COOKERY BOOK. Caramel is the last stage of syrup making; the sugar becomes a dark yellow colour, and emits a strong odour. The pan must be drawn away from the fire, and a little water thrown into it. In making orange-flower or cocoa-nut candy, these are thrown into the boiling syrup after it has been clarified and skimmed, and when it is very thick and white. It is then stirred until it rises in a mass, when it must be taken out immediately and laid on sheets of fine white paper. There is no great difficulty in making syrups and candies, but they require great care and constant watching, as if left on the fire a moment too long the syrup may be entirely spoilt, and be either wasted or require re-boiling. PRESERVING. In preserving fruit the pan containing it should at first be subjected to gentle heat, until the sugar is melted; the heat may then be increased until the boiling point is reached. Steady, regular heat must then be continued the whole time, together with constant stirring, or the fruit will burn and the preserve be rendered uneatable. The pots when filled must be left until they are stone cold before covering. The best way to do this is, first, to lay on the j"am a round of tissue paper the exact size of the jar, and press it down. A second round of tissue paper, cut larger than the jar, is dipped on one side in beaten white of egg, laid over the top, and pressed down round the rim. The white of egg on the inner side will make the paper adhere firmly to the jar, and the top, when dry, will have the consistence of parchment.

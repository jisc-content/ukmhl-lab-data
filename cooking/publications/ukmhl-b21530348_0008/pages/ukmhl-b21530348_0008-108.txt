762 THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. For details respecting Culinary Processes, Utensils, Sauces, tic., referred to, see under their special heads. Weights and Measures—continued. 2 table-spoonfuls = 1 gravy-spoonful (1 sherry wineglassful, or 1 fluid ounce). 2 Dort wineglassfuls* = 1 teacupful (1 gill, 1 qrtm., or 5 fluid ounces). 2 teacupfuls = 1 breakfast-cupful (1 tum- blerful, £ pint, or 10 fluid ounces). 2 breakfast-cupfuls = ] pint (20 fluid ounces, or 1 fluid poundf). 2 pints = 1 quart. 4 quarts = 1 gallon. * 2 port wineglassfuls = 3 sherry wineglassfuls. + 1 fluid pound of 20 fluid ounces —lib. of 16oz. solid measure. Solids. Measurements of capacity must necessarily vary considerably, as regards weight, with different mate- rials ; for example, the weight of a teacupful of breadcrumbs is less than that of a teacupful of moist sugar. To provide for this discrepancy, certain typical ingredients are given hereunder by which, with judgment, a very accurate apportionment can be made. A Breakfast-cupful of Breadcrumbs (pressed in) weighs about 4oz. Butter* or Lard (melted, or pressed down) ,, 7oz. Currants or Sultanas (heaped) ,, 6oz. Flour, Cornflour, Arrowroot, or other floury starches (level) ,, 4oz. Flour, Cornflour, Arrowroot, or othei floury starches (heaped) ,, 6oz. Baisins (stoned and pressed in) ,, 8oz. Rice (heaped) ,, 7oz. Sago, Tapioca, Semolina, &c. (heaped) ,, 4oz. Suet, chopped very fine (heaped) ,, 4oz. Sugar, moist or caster (heaped) ,, Soz. * A “pat” of butter weighs loz. Average Weights. It must be borne in mind that these refer to medium sizes only. 10 Eggs 25 Eggs (yolks only) ... 20 Eggs (whites only) * 5 or 6 Apples 3 or 4 Carrots (old) ... 15 to 20 Carrots (new) 6 to 8 Onions 4 to 6 Potatoes (old) weigh about lib. „ lib. „ lib. „ lib. ,, lib. ,, lib. „ lib. „ 11b. * This allows for some waste in separating yolks from whites. The white constitutes more than half the egg. When Scales and Weights are available it is advisable to weigh all the ingredients used according to trades- men’s avoirdupois weights. 27 3 grains = ldr. 16 drachms -=loz. 16 ounces = 1 lb. 28 pounds = 1 quarter 4 quarters = 1 hundredweight (cwt.) 20 hundredweight = 1 ton. The foregoing are the weights in general use, and should therefore be adopted for weighing ingredients in the kitchen. The following are what may be termed Weights and Measures—continued. In addition to the above tables, there are Measures used in some parts of the country which are somewhat confusing. Potatoes and fruit are sometimes sold by the gallon. The following table explains the relative values of these quantities and proportions, the weights differing in almost every case: Dry Measures of Capacity. 4 pints (f gallon) = 1 pottle. £ gallon (z pottles; = 1 quarter peck. 1 gallon = 1 half-peck. 2 gallons = 1 peck. 4 pecks =1 half bushel. 8 pecks = 1 bushel. Sometimes fruit is sold by the sieve, that being a fanciful measure depending upon the size of the vessel, usually a sieve, that the fruit is gathered into. As there is no definite capacity ascribed for this measure, it is often made use of for the purposes of deception. In Scotland a table peculiar to the country is occa- sionally used; but since the introduction of railways the English and Scotch peoples have become so closely asso- ciated in commerce that they are now very seldom used. Scotch- Dry Measures. 4 lippies = 1 peck 4 pecks = 1 firlot. 4 firlots = 1 boll.* 2 bolls = 1 quarter. * A boll of meal is 1401b., or 2 bolls are 1 sack ; on the Border, a boll is equal to 6 firlots. Concerning the measurement of liquids the following tables are used : Liquid Imperial Measures. 4 gills = 1 pint. 2 pints = 1 quart. 4 quarts = 1 gallon Beer. Firkin = 9 gallons. Kilderkin = 18 gallons. Barrel = 36 gallons. Hogshead (rarely used)...= 54 gallons. Puncheon ,, ...= 72 gallons. Butt = 108 gallons, or 3 barrels. Wine. Aum of Hock or Rhenish = 30 gallons. Hogshead of Claret = 46 gallons. Pipe of Madeira or Cape = 92 gallons. Pipe of Marsala = 93 gallons. Pipe of Teneriffe = 100 gallons. Butt of Sherry or Tent = 108 gallons. Pipe of Port or Masdeu = 115 gallons. Butt of Lisbon or Bucellas = 117 gallons. In France find other parts of the Continent a system of weighing and measuring is used based upon the decimal, or multiple of ten, plan; but, although very convenient in many respects, the prospect of its adoption in this country is very remote. Special Weights. Stone ofButellers’ Meat = 81b. Firkin of Butter =561b. Box of Fish, about =901b. Barrel of Raisins = 1121b. Barrel of Butter =4 firkins, or 2241b. Sack of Potatoes = 1681b., or 3 bushels of 56lb. each. Sack of Flour = 2801b., or 5 bushels of 561b. each. Peck or Stone of Flour = 141b. Gallon of Flour =7lb. [quartern) loaf. Quart of Flour = 3flb., which will make a 4lb. (or French Weights and Measures. Measures of Capacity are calculated from the Litre, which is about If British pints (P76077). The 10th part of a litre = 1 Decilitre. The 100th part of a litre = 1 Centilitre. The 1000th part of a litre =1 Millilitre. 10 litres = 1 Decalitre. 100 litres = 1 Hectolitre. 1000 litres = 1 Kilolitre. 10,000 litres = 1 Myrialitre.

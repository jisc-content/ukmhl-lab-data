MEN MEN 253 150 Tons at 30s. 160=£7 10s. x30= £225. Ans. To calculate cwts. grs. lbs.— Set down the cults., to the right put the lbs. contained in the qvs. and lbs., to which add 12 lbs. for each cwt., which will give the total number of lbs. If the price per lb. be pence, consider them as pence ; if shillings, consider them as shillings. 5 cwts. 2 qrs. 20 lbs. at 6d. per lb. Thus :—5 cwts. ; place after the 5 the number of the lbs. (2 qrs. and 20 lbs.) =576 lbs., to which add 5 12 lbs.= 60 lbs.+576 lbs. =636 lbs. taken as pence=£2 13s. x6d.=£15 18s. Ans. 15 cwts. 3 qrs. 18 lbs. at lOJd. per lb. Number of lbs. 1782 lbs. as pence, =£78s. 6dx.lOJd.=£7719s. 3d. Ans. In calculating acres, roods, and perches, reckon the acres as pounds, multiply the roods by 5, the product consider as shillings, and the perch- es by l^d. (which is the price of a perch at £1 per acre) which will give the amount of the whole at £1 per acre, which multiply by the number of pounds per acre. 80 acres, 2 roods, 8 perches, at £3 10s. per acre. £. s. d. SO 2 8 5 lj 80 11 Ox 3i=£281 18s. Cd. Ans. Trot Weight.—The grs. are to be considered as half-pence, the diets, as shillings, and ozs. as pounds. 12 ozs. 8 dwts. 4 grs. at 6s. 8d. per oz. 6s. 8d=J£ £12 8 2 £4 2 8J Ans. To find the value of an ounce, the price per lb. being given. Take the shillings as farthings, and multiply by 3 for Avoirdupois ; for Troy, multiply by 4. Thus 1 oz. Avoirdupois at 4s. per lb. 4x3=12 farthings=3d. Ans. The price of a pound of Avoirdupois being known, to find the price of a stone of 14 pounds. For every penny in the price of a pound, take one shilling and twopence for the stone ; thus a stone at 3d. per lb. cost 3s. 6d., at 8d. 9s. 4d. For a farthing in the price of a lb. reckon 3 id. in the stone ; for a half-penny, 7d; and, for three farthings, LOjd. ; as a stone at 9 Jd. per lb. comes to 10s. 6d. and 3Jd. or 10s. 9$d. at 4Jd., 4s. 8d. and 7d. or 5s. 3d. and at 6|d., 7s. 10i The price of a pound being given, to find that of a hundred-weight or 112 lbs. For every farthing in the price of a pound, take twice the number of shillings, and four times the number of pence. Example : 1 cwt. at 2 jd. per lb. 2Jd.=10 farthings. 10 times 2=20, the shillings, 10 times 4=40, the pence, and these added, make £1 3s. 4d. To find the value of a lb., the price per cwt. being given.—Multiply the shillings in the price by 3, and divide by 7 for the price of a pound in farthings.— Thus, 1 lb. at 14s. per cwt. 14x3 +-7=6 farthings=l£d. Ans. From the price of a Cwt., to find that of a Ton. For every shilling reckon a pound, for threepence, a crown, and for every half-penny over, tenpence. As, at £3 9s. 8d. a cwt., how much a ton ? Ans. £69 and 10s. and 3s. 4d. or £69 13s. 4d. By reversing the process, the price of a cwt. may be found from that of a ton, thus, a ton at £34 16s. 8d. how much a cwt? Ans. 34 shillings, 3 threepences, and 2 half-pence, or £114s. lOd. When the price of one is known, to find that of 100. For every farthing in the price of one, take twice as many shillings, and once as many pence. Thus, 100 articles at 2£ each, 2J=g farthings, 9 times 2=18s. and 9d. give 18s. 9d. Ans. 100 lbs. at 5Jd. per lb. S£d.=21 farthings, 21 times 2=42 shillings, or £2 2s. and 21d.=ls. 9d. then, £2 2s. and Is. 9d.=£2 3s. 9d. the price of a hundred at the given rate.

303 PIC PIC PHEASANT, to stew.—Put it into the stewpan, with, as much veal stock as will cover it; stew it till there is liquor enough left for sauce; skim, and add artichoke bottoms parboiled, beaten mace, a glass of wine, pepper and salt; thicken with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a little lemon- juice ; take up the pheasant; pour the sauce over it; put forcemeat balls into the dish, and serve it. PICKLE, Picallillo, or Indian Pickles.—Lay 1 lb. of white gin- ger in water a night, then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt till the other ingredients are ready. Peel, slice, and salt 1 lb. of garlic three days, then put in the sun to dry. Salt and dry long pepper in the same way. Prepare various sorts of vege- tables thus: Quarter small white cabbages, salt three days, squeeze and set in the sun to dry. Caul iflowers cut in their branch- es; take ofF the green from the radishes; cut celery in three-inch length; ditto young French beans whole, and the shoots of elder, which will Jook like bamboo. Ap- ples and cucumbers, the least seedy sort; cut them in slices or quart- , ers. All must be salted, drained, ! and dried in the sun, except the ; latter; over which pour boiling j vinegar, and in 12 hours drain i them, but use no salt. Put the spice, garlic, £ lb. of i mustard-seed, and vinegar enough for the quantity to pickle, into a J stone jar, and 1 oz. of turmeric, i When the vegetables are ready, put some of them into a two-quart a stone jar, and pour over them one a quart of boiling vinegar. Next ' day take out those vegetables; i and when drained, put them into i a large stock jar, and boiling the 1 vinegar, pour it over more of the , vegetables; let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed each set from dust; then to every gallon of vinegar put 2 ozs. of flour of mus- tard, mixing, by degrees, with a little of it boiling hot. The whole of the vinegar should be previ- ously scalded, but left to be cold be- fore it is put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. This pickle will not be ready for a year; but you may make a small jar for eating in a foi'tnight, only by giving the cauliflower one scald in water, after salting and drying as above, but without the prepara- tive vinegar; then pour the vine- gar, that has the spice and garlick boiling hot over. If at any time it be found that the vegetables have not swelled properly, boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will plump them. PIC-NIC BISCUITS.—Into 1 lb. of flour, work very small 2 ozs. of butter, mix well with half a salt-spoonful of the finest carbon- ate of soda, 2 ozs. of sugar, mix these thoroughly with the flour, and make up the paste with a few spoonfuls of milk, not more than quarter of a pint. Knead it very smooth, and roll it quarter of an inch thick, cut in rounds, II inch diameter, roll it thin, prick them well, lay on tins sprinkled with flour, bake in a slow oven till they are crisp. When they are cold, put them into dry canisters. Cream instead of milk will greatly enrich them. Carraway seeds or ginger can be added at pleasure. The quantity of soda should be so small as not to taste them in the slight- est; milk which is slighly sour, mav be used with it.

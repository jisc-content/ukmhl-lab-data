Tie them close for a year. Then take them out, and for every gal- lon of liquor, put two heads of garlic, j lb. of anchovies, a quart of port wine, and 1 oz. each of mace, cloves, long, black, and Ja- maica pepper, and ginger. Boil all together till ths liquor is re- duced to half. Bottle for use. It is good in fish sauce, or stewed beef. The longer it is kept, the better it is. WALNUT KETCHUP, very fine.—Boil a gallon of the express- ed juice of green tender walnuts, and skim it well; then put in 2 lbs. of anchovies, bones and liquor, 2 lbs. shalots, 1 oz. each of cloves, mace, pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, but is not good the first. Be very careful to express the juice at home; for it is rarely unadulterated, if bought. WALNUTS, to pickle.—When a pin will go into them, put a brine of salt and water boiled, and strong enough to bear an egg, being quite cold first. Let them soak six days; then change the brine, let them stand six more; then drain, and pour over them in the jar a pickle of the best vinegar, with plenty of pepper, pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard- seed, and horse raddish; all boiled together, but cold. To every hun- dred of walnuts put six spoonfuls of mustard-seed, and two or three heads of garlick or shalot, but the latter is least strong. In this way they will be good for several years, if closely covered. They will not be fit to eat under six months. This pickle makes good ketchup. WARM PLASTER. Gum plaster, 1 oz.; blistering plaster, 2 drachms. Melt over a gentle fire. This plaster is useful in sciatica, and in rheumatic pains; renew once a week. Should it blister the part, use less blistering plaster, and add a little camphor.

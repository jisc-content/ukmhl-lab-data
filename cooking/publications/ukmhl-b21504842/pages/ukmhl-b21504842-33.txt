Take a tablespoonful night and morning in warm milk. ASPARAGUS, to boil.—Scrape the asparagus; tie them in small bunches ; boil them in a large pan of water -with salt in it; before you dish them up toast some slices of bread, and then dip them in the boiling water; lay the asparagus on the toasts ; pour on them rich melted butter, and serve hot. Ef. ASPARAGUS, ragout of.—Cut small asparagus like green peas; the best method is to break them off first; then tie them in small bunches to cut, boil them till half done ; then drain them, and finish with butter, a little broth, herbs, two cloves, and a sprig of savory. When done, take out the cloves, herbs, &c., mix two yolks of eggs, with a little flour, and broth, to garnish a first course dish. But if you intend to serve it in second course mix cream, a little salt, and sugar. Hu. ASPARAGUS AMULET.— Beat up six eggs with cream, boil some of the largest and finest

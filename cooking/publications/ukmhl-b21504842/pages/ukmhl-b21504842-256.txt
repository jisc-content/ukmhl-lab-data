254 MEN MILE To find what any nnraber of pence per day, will amount to in a year. Add together as many pounds, half as many pounds, and as many Jlve- pences as there are pence per day, and their sum will be the answer. Ex- amples. What does a boy who earns 3d. a day gain in a year? Ans. £3 and £1 10s. and 16d. or £4 11s. 3d. What will 8d. a day amount to in a year? £8 and £4 and 3s. 4d. or £12 3s. 4d. Or, take 305 days as pence= £1 10s. 5d. which multiply by the number of pence per day. To find the amount of any number of pence per day, (Sunday excepted) for a year. For every penny a day, take so many Guineas, Crowns, and Pence ; thus, at 9d. a day. =£9 9s. and 9 crowns=£2 5s. and 9(1. The sum= £1114s. 9d. To find the price of a Gross, the price of one article being given.— Take the pence in the price of one article as shillings, and the number of pence in these shillings will be the price of a gross in shillings. Thus, 1 Gross at 6d. each. 6d. as 6s. reckoned as pence=72, which con- sider as 72s. Ans. INTEREST. At 5 per cent, multiply the princi- pal by the months ; reckon the pro- duct in Pounds sterling as pence.— Or, the Interest of £1 per month at 5 per cent, and so proportionately for any part of a pound. Find the Interest for one month, and multiply it by the number of months. Thus, Interest of £40 for 3 months at 5 per cent. £40x3 months=£120 as pence=10s. Ans.

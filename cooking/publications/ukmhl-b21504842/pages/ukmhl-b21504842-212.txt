The stomach and intestines are lined with a membrane which se- cretes a liquid termed “mucous.” This disease is often caused by ex- posure to cold and wet, especially while in a state of perspiration; the suppression of customary evacua- tions, indigestible food, mercury, frequent drastic purges, feculent accumulation in the intestines, strangulated rupture, and over- feeding, giving nature more than it is able to do; drunkenness is an awful thing for the bowels, gradu- ally, by its extreme terrible friction, lessening the secretion of the mu- cous.

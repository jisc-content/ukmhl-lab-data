When cold, place between each pearl a smaller one of red-currant jelly. Fill your bouchees with apricot marmalade, ap- ple jelly, &c.; if, however, the jelly, or whatever else you may use, be of a red colour, your intermediate pearls should be composed of light-coloured preserve, such as apricot marmalade, Ac.

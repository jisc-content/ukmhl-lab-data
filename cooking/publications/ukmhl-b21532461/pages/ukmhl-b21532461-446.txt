414 PHE PIIE take care tliat jour meat is covered with the liquor ; put a buttered paper over the whole, and set it on the fire ; when it has boiled a few minutes, take it off, and put the saucepan on the stove with fire on the lid, and leave it for an hour, boiling constantly. When quite cold, take out each article, add the ham and bacon to a farce, made as di- rected for Partridge standing-pie chaud- froid. Raise your crust as usual, and put into it a quarter of the farce, make it smooth, and having untied the veal, lay that in the pie, strew a little spiced salt over, a third of the remaining farce, and four truffles, each cut in two; then take the thread from the pheasants, trim them a little that they may lay in the pie with- out injuring the shape ; put a pinch of spiced salt, and some truffles ; cover them with the rest of the farce, in which put more truffles, cut in halves, then add the butter, hay leaves, &c., and finish as di- rected in the above mentioned receipt. Three hours and a half are sufficient to bake this pie; when taken out of the oven, pour in the consommS, previously strained through a cloth, and close the hole with a piece of paste. Pheasant (to rcast').—Take out the en- trails, and singe the pheasant over the stove, then roll a bit of butter in pepper and salt, and put it into the inside of the bird ; truss it neatly with the head turned on one side, keeping the breast as full as possible; over which should be laid slices of fat bacon tied on with packthread ; be- fore it is put on the spit, break the back- bone, that it may lay the better on the dish. A good sized pheasant will take half an hour; when nearly done, take away the bacon, brown the pheasant well; sprinkle it with flour and salt, and froth it with butter ; serve it with water cresses, a good gravy under it, and brend sauce in a boat. Pheasant (Salmis of).*—Take two cold roasted pheasants, cut them up, trim the pieces properly, take off all the skin, and put the limbs into a stewpan. Put the remains of the pheasants into another saucepan, with a glass of white wine, four shalots, a little Seville orange peel, half a clove of garlic, half a bay leaf, four spoons- ful of espagvole tvavaillce, a bit of glaze, and a spoonful of consomme; reduce these, and then strain the sauce over the phea- sant, make it hot in the bain-marie, but do not let it boil ; lay them in a dish, the smallest pieces first, and the more con- siderable ones round, intermixed with fried bread ; squeeze the juice of a Seville orange into the sauce, which pour over the bird. Pheasant with Saur-Kraut *—Take a large pheasant, and having picked and singed, truss it like a chicken ; season the inside with parsley, scallions, salt, pepper, I and spices, and lard it; take a sufficient i quantity of saur-kraut to fill a good sized dish, put it into a saucepan, with a piece I of bacon, and a servelas, and some pot j skimmings, set it on a moderate fire for a quarter of an hour, then take out the ba- con and servelas, put in the pheasant, and leave it an hour and a half; when done, take it out, put it on a dish, drain the saur- kraut, and lay it round the bird; remove the skin, and cut the servelas into slices, which, with the bacon also sliced, place round the whole. Pheasant (Souffli of).*—This dish is prepared in the same manner as the soufjlS of partridge. Pheasant with Truffles.—Take a fine large pheasant, and prepare it the same as a fowl for boiling, with slices of fat bacon on the breasts; and put into the inside four or five whole truffles, and some chopped, with parsley and thyme ; then put it to roast till it is well done, and of a fine brown, colour, then dish it up, and garnish it with a good brown sauce, with truffles and mushrooms. Pheasant to Truss.— Let it be well picked and singed, then cut a slit in the back of the neck, and carefully take the crop out witliout breaking it; then cut off the vent, and draw out the inside, after this, well wipe the inside, and then put in a little pepper and salt, mixed with a bit of butter. Having cleansed it, proceed to truss the bird, by first cutting off the pinion at the first joint, so that the feathers need not be picked off tliat part; break the back bone, and truss it in the same manner as a fowl, by pressing the legs close to the apron, then turn the bird on the breast, and run a skewer through the end of the pinion, the leg, the body, and the leg and pinion on the other side, with the head fixed on the end of the skewer, and over the breast lay a slice of fat j bacon, and tie it on with packthread. It for boiling or stewing, truss them the same as a fowl for boiling. Pheasants a la Tnrque-—Prepare two fine young pheasants, the same as chickens are prepared for stewing, with slices ot fat bacon laid over the breasts, t icn e them stew very gently in good braise, i they are done ; in the meantime have

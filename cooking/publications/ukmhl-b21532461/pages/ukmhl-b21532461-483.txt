Rabbits (Boiled).—Before they are boil- ed, hold the heads for a few minutes in a saucepan of water that is boiling, which will prevent the disagreeable appearance they otherwise have in cutting up ; they will take about half an hour in boiling, according to their size. If boiled and smothered with onion sauce, melt the butter with milk instead of water. Rabbit (Broiled).—-Take a couple of young rabbits, cut them up, and put them to steep for a few hours in a little oil, mixed with parsley, leeks, a few mush- rooms, and a clove of garlic, all shred fine, salt, and pepper ; roll each piece of rabbit in a rasher of bacon, and put them, with a part of the seasoning, into pieces of white paper; butter the papers inside ; broil upon a gridiron, over a very slow fire, and serve hot in the papers. Rabbit Fillets en Cartouche*—Put into a pan about the size of an egg of grated bacon, double the quantity of butter, four dessert-spoonsful of oil; make these quite hot, and add three dessert-spoonsful of champignons, minced very small, and squeezed thoroughly in a cloth ; leave the pan on the fire for a quarter of an hour, then put in a spoonful of slialots, well washed and minced, give them a turn, and add the same of shred parsley; stir the whole together over the fire; your fillets being ready, cut each in half, and put them into the above, with salt, pepper, and pounded spice; when they are brown on both sides, take them out, and set them by to cool. In the meantime, cut as many square pieces of paper as you have bits of rabbits, and each large enough to contain the half fillet; rub them over with oil, lay a thin slice of bacon on every one ; on this put the fillet, with some of the above sea- soning ; wrap the paper over in the form of a cartouche, talcing care to fold the ends of the paper so that none of its contents can escape ; place these on a gridiron, over a clear fire, turn them frequently; when done, serve them dry, or with a clear gravy, as you please. Rabbits in a Fricassee.—Take two lino white rabbits, and cut them in pieces, by cutting off the legs, shoulders, and back ; blanch them in boiling water, and skim them for one minute ; stir a few trimmings of mushrooms in a stewpan over the fire, with a bit of butter, till it begins to fry ; then stir in a spoonful of flour ; mix into the flour, a little at a time, nearly a quart of good consomme, which set on the fire, and when it boils, put the rabbits in, and let them boil gently till done ; then put them into another stewpan, and reduce the sauce till nearly as thick as paste; mix in about half a pint of good boiling cream, and when it becomes the thickness of bichamelle sauce in general, squeeze it through the tammy to the rabbits; make it very hot, shake in a few mushrooms, the yolk of an egg, and a little cream ; then serve it to table. Add Cayenne, salt, and lemon. Rabbits may also be preserved, white or brown, in the same manner as chick- ens. Rabbit Galantine*—Bone a rabbit en- tirely (except the head), take away the meat of the thick part of the thigh, lard it with seasoned lardons ; mince the meat taken off with the fillets of two other rabbits, take an equal quantity of bacon, minced, mix them together, add salt, pep- per, pounded spice, and minced truffles; lay the rabbit open on a cloth, season, and spread a layer of the farce all over it; on this place tongue a Vicariate, truffles, and lardons, in small pieces; proceed thus, alternately, until the rabbit is full ; then form it as well as you can ; tie slices of bacon all over it, wrap it in the cloth, and tie it again; lay slices of bacon in a braising-pan, put in the rabbit, a knuckle of veal, the bones of the rahbit, two car- rots, three onions (one stuck with cloves), two bay-leaves, a little thyme, parsley, scallions, half a bottle of white wine, a ladleful of stock, and a little salt; set the pan on the fire to simmer for two hours, then take from the fire, and in half an hour’s time take out the rabbit carefully When quite cold, take it out of the cloth glaze, and serve it. Rabbits Gihelotte.*— Cut a rabbit into pieces, as near of a size as possible ; make a roux with a quarter of a pound of butter and two dessert-spoonsfuls of flour ; when it is of a good colour, put in the rabbit to brown, add a quart of good stock, and half the quantity of white wine, stir till it boils, then put in some champignons, streaky bacon (previously browned), a bunch of parsley, scallions, a little thyme, and a bay-leaf; set the whole on a brisk fire to reduce the liquor ; season with salt and pepper to the taste. Toss up about thirty small onions in a little butter, and add them, with some bits of eel, to the above when about three parts done. Take 2 c 2

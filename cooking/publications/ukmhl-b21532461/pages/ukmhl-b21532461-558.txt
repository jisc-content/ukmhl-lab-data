On the ninth day, put a few cloves and some cinnamon in a glass of water for twenty-four hours; then cut each clove into four pieces, lengthwise; cut the cinnamon also into bits about the same size, take the walnuts out of the syrup, and stick four pieces of clove, and as many of cinnamon, into every walnut; in the mean while, boil the syrup to grand lisse ; and when half cold, pour it over the fruit and leave it; in twenty-four hours drain off the syrup, and set it on the fire for the last time ; as soon ns it begins to boil, put in the fruit, let them boil up together about a dozen times, and then take them from the fire. Make the bottles quite hot, put in the walnuts one by one, with a skimmer, pour the syrup on (they should be quite covered with it), and when cold, cork them tight, and tie a parchment over every one. These walnuts may be eaten immedi- ately, or they will keep for ten years but, as in the course of time the fruit sucks up the syrup, they should be filled up, when required, with a syrup, made with coarse sugar, boiled with some water.

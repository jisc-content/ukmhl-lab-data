196 CRE CRE quite, boiling for an hour and a half; then, if the cream is properly set, which may be known by touching it with your finger, and observing whether it may be easily detached from the mould, take it from the bain-marie and let it stand; when no more than lukewarm, turn it out on your dish. It sometimes happens, unavoidably, that bubbles arise on the surface of the cream ; in such a case, boil a glass of cream, and add to it, by degrees, three yolks of eggs; stir it constantly with a wooden spoon; mix three ounces of fine sugar with it, and continue stirring it over the fire, till of a proper consistence, and on the point of boiling, then take it off and strain it. W hen the cream is ready for table, cover it com- pletely with the last-made cream, which will hide its defects. Cream Biscuits.—Break six eggs, se- parate the yolks and whites, beat the former with six ounces of pow'der sugar, and the same of flour; whisk the whites, and then mix them together; add to it whipped cream, in proportion to the sugar and flour, stir it carefully, pour this into moulds or paper cases, and bake. Cream Biscuits.*—Take six ounces of flour, two of powder sugar, a pound and a half of cream, and the whites of twelve eggs ; beat up the latter with the sugar and flour; whip the cream, and lay it on a sieve. When well drained, mix them together, and put the prepa- ration into cases, and bake in the usual way. Cream Biscuits*—Put the yolks of three eggs into a pan with a quarter of a pound of powder sugar, on which has been rasped the zest of a small cedrat; beat them up for about ten minutes, and then whip the whites and mix them gra- dually with the yolks, an ounce and a half of dry sifted flour, and four spoons- ful of whipped cream. When these in- gredients are well mixed and smooth, pour the paste into about a dozen small cases, glaze the tops of them with sifted sugar; when that is melted, put the biscuits into a gentle oven, and bake them for twenty or five-and-twenty mi- nutes. Cream (Burnt).—Set on the fire in a stewpan two tablo-spoonsiul of clarified sugar, leave it on till it begins to burn and get brown ; then shake it about, and put in an ounce of ratafia biscuit, a small piece of lemon peel, sugar, and orange flower; stir together; then put in a pint of new milk, boiled; when it has simmered by the side of the stove for twenty minutes, beat up four eggs, and the yolks of two, in a stewpan; take the milk from the fire, and mix wdtli it half a pint of good thick cream, then the eggs, which rub through a tammy, and repeat it a second time. Rub some small moulds with clarified butter, and fill them with cream; have a large stew- pan on the fire with a very little water at the bottom, when it boils gently, put in your cream; and cover it close, with fire laid upon the cover (if you think proper, it may be put into one large mould).— When done take them out of the water, wipe them, and turn them on a dish. Cream Cake.*—Putapound offlourup- on a pie-board ; make a hole in the middle, put in half a pint of clotted cream, and a little salt; mix the paste lightly, let it stand for half an hour, then add half a pound of butter; roll it out, five times, the same as puff paste, and form it into small cakes; gild them with the yolk of egg, and bake in an oven. Cream Calces.—Sift some double-re- fined sugar; beat the whites of seven or eight eggs; shake in as many spoonsful of the sugar; grate in the rind of a large lemon; drop the froth on a paper, laid on tin, in lumps at a distance; sift a good deal of sugar over them; set them in a moderate oven; the froth will rise; just colour them; you may put raspberry jam, and stick two" bottoms together; put them in a cool oven to dry; serve, if you please, with whipped cream between every two. Cream Cakes.*—Put into a stewpan two glasses of cream, a quarter of a pound of butter, the rind of a lemon, cut small, a quarter of a pound of powder sugar, and a pinch of salt. Set it on the fire, and when it begins to boil, put it by the side of the stove; take out the lemon peel, and add, by degrees, as much flour as the liquid will bear; keep stir- ring it constantly, and place it on the fire again, for five minutes, then pour it into a basin; add to it, one by one, as many eggs as will make the paste stick to the fingers; put the paste on a slab, and make your cakes of a round form. Cream an Caramel.*—Put a pint of milk and half a pint of cream, with a hit of cinnamon, some coriander seeds, and the peel of a young lemon, into a sauce- pan, and boil them for a quarter of an hour; then take it off the fire, and

Endive Soup.—Ibis is a clear soup, made in the same maimer as lettuce soup. Be careful to wash the endive well, and pick out the bitter parts. Endive (Stewed).—Take a dozen heads of the very best endive; pick off what you think bitter; wash it well, and blanch it whole in plenty of water, with a good handful of salt; when done, lay them on a sieve to drain, and tie each separate with packthread, and lay them between lards of iat bacon, and stew them gently in good strong consomme; take them out of tlmcim- somme, and lay them in a line upon a clean cloth; take off the packthread, and roll the endive tight up in the cloth for a mi- nute or two, then open the cloth, and cut the endive in pieces, about six inches in length ; lay them on a dish ; have ready a saute a l’Espagnole with a bit of butter mixed in it, and a squeeze of lemon; when this sauce is very hot, pour it over the en- utve, and serve it to table. Endive au Veloutt*—Take off all the outer leaves of your endive, and havino- opened the hearts, put them into cold water to wash them. In the mean while neat a kettle of water, put in it a handful ot salt, then throw in the endive; keep it constantly under the water, to prevent eir turr‘ing black. As soon as the en- dive is tender, drain, and then put it into cold water, and when quite cold, drain it again; press the water out with your hands; then chop it small, and put it into a sauce- pan, with some butter, salt, and pepper, stir it well, and then add five spoonsful of veloute, the same ot consomme; reduce it till pretty thick, and then put it in a dish, with fried bread round it. Endive may also be dressed with cream, in which case put two spoonsful of flour into it, and moisten it with cream. Entree.*—There is no word precisely equivalent to this in English. Any dish of butcher’s meat, fowl, game, or fish, dressed for the Jirst course, is called an entree. ENTREMET.*—There is no word equivalent to this in English. All dishes of vegetables, jellies, pastries, salad, prawns, lobsters, and, in general, every thing that appears in the second course, except the roast, is called an entremet. ESPAGNOLE.—Take an old fowl, and about fourteen pounds of leg or shoulder of veal; chop the latter into pieces, and put it, with very little water, into a large saucepan, with two carrots, three onions, a pound of ham, a few peppercorns, a small quantity of spice, and a clove of garlic ; let this stew over a moderate fire, shakino- it frequently, till it becomes of a brown colour, when you may add to it a sufficient quantity of hot water to come about four inches above the meat. Set it by the side of the stove to boil gently, skimming when necessary, till the meat comes from the bones; then strain it through a silk sieve, and set it by for use. Espacnule (Grande) *—Take two jioix of veal, a pheasant, or four partridges, half a noix of ham, four or five large carrots, five onions (one of them stuck with five cloves) j put all these into a saucepan, and pour over them a bottle of Madeira wine, and a ladleful of stock; set it over a large fire, to reduce it, then place it on a slow fire, until slightly coloured; take it off, and let it stand about ten minutes. Prepare some sous-noit as directed for Grunde Sauce, and add the liquor to the espagnole; skim it well, and put in some rottx, two or three bay leaves, a little thyme, mushrooms, parsley, scallions, and shnlots. As soon as the sauce boils, set the sauce- pan by the sido of the stove, to let it do more gently, for two hours. Be very care- ul that your saucepan be perfectly clean before you use it, otherwise the espagnole Will be thick and muddy.

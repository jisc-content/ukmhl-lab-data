HALT Vinegar.*—In Germany, this vinegar is made with barley and wheat malt, of both of which there are two sorts, oie dried in an oven or kiln, the other dred in the open air; of the latter the largest quantity is generally used. Put ten gallons of boiling water into a larje tub, stir it till it cools a little ; then adc your malt (two thirds barley, and one thiid wheat) a little at a time, stirring it wtli a stick until thoroughly mixed with th>. water; cover the tub. Boil some more wtter, take the mash from the bottom of thelarge tub, put it into a smaller one, anc place this within a larger one, so that the'e may be two inches space between thebottoms of each tub ; set another small tub on the top ; this latter should have hols pierced in it, through which pour the boiling water on the mash, beneath lay strav over, and leave it for an hour and a half; after that time, draw off the water by neans of a cock placed between the two tubs; then pour fresh boiling water over the malt, let it stand again, and repeat thisoperation as many times as you think necssary; the precise number must be reguatedaccording to the intended strength of tie vinegar. Pour the liquor into casks, and,vhen cold and settled, put it into a largi barrel with a head to it; add some beeilees, cover and leave it for ten hours to foment; as soon as it is clear, pour it intoa cask, previously washed with strong vingar, put to it some yeast; skim it wel, and you will then have vinegar of the besl quality.

Maraschino (Conserve of).* — Pound and sift some of the best lump sugar, mix it in a china basin with spirit of maras- chino, until it is of the consistence of pastil paste; then put it into a skillet over the fire, and beat it gently, stirring it con- stantly (but without letting it boil), till very liquid, when it may be poured into funnel-shaped tin moulds; put these moulds on iron plates, and dry the con- serve in a stove. Maraschino (Frontage Bavarnis).*—Boil a pint of double cream, to which add half a pound of sugar and six drachms of clari- fied isinglass ; run it through a sieve, and place it on ice; the moment it begins to congeal, pour in, by degrees, half a glass of maraschino; then stir in the whipped cream, and finish as usual.

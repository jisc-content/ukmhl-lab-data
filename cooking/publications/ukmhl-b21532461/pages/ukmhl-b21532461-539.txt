VEA VEA 507 ready a pint of green peas boiled, six cucumbers pared and sliced, and two let- tuces cut into quarters, and stewed in brown gravy, with some forcemeat balls ready fried ; put all these to the veal, and let them just simmer; lay the veal in a dish, pour the sauce and peas over it, and serve the lettuces and forcemeat balls all round. Veal (Cold) hashed.—Cut it in slices, flour it, put it into a saucepan with a little good gravy, some grated lemon peel, pepper, salt, and ketchup. Make it hot, then add a little lemon juice ; serve fried sippets round the dish. Veal (Minced).—Cut the veal into very small pieces, but do not chop it; take a little white gravy, a little cream or milk, a bit of butter rolled in flour, and some grated lemon peel; let these boil till of the consistence of a fine thick cream ; with a little salt, and white pepper ; put it into the saucepan to the other ingredients, and make it quite hot, but be careful that it does not boil after the veal has been put in, or it will be bard; before being taken up, squeeze in some juice of lemon ; serve it on a dish over sippets. Veal (Minced) with Podched Eggs.— Mince part of a roasted fillet of veal ex- tremely fine, put it into a stewpan, and pour over it a sufficient quantity of good hot hcchamelle saucfe to make it of a toler- able thickness ; then have a stewpan full of water, with a little vinegar in it, and salt, and as soon as it boils, break in two eggs, and keep it boiling quick (but not so as to boil over) ; when they are done, take them out with a cullender spoon, and put them into another stewpan of clear warm water; break two more into the vinegar and water, and do the same as the two first, and so on till six are done; when you want to serve, squeeze a little lemon juice in the mince, pour it on a hot dish; take the eggs out of the water neatly, trim them, and lay them on the veal, and serve. VI?Al (Minced) in a Timbale.—Make some mince, the same as minced veal, with poached eggs, and keep it hot by the fire, fry some good plain pancakes, made with- out sugar or lemon peel ; then lay a pan- cake at the bottom, and all round a well- buttered oval mould, then lay the rest open, and spread each with the mince; roll them up neatly, and lay them close in the mould; cover them up with a pan- cake; about half an hour before dinner is to be served, put it into a moderate oven ; and when wanted, turn them out in a dish, and pour a little strong gravy in the dish under them. Veal a la Moclle.*—Take some very thin cutlets, beat them well with a rolling- pin; pound a piece of crumb of bread, about the size of an egg, some bacon, beef marrow, shred parsley, with pepper and salt, in a mortar; spread a little of this farce over a slice of veal, and cover it with another; fix the edges together with beaten egg; when all are done, dip them in egg, bread, and broil them. Veal Olives.—Take some slices from a fillet of veal, then cut them round of about the size of the palm of your hand, make a forcemeat with the remains of roasted chickens, suet, herbs, eggs, and spices; lay the slices alternately with a little of this forcemeat and fat livers sliced, truffles, or mushrooms ; continue these to a mode- rate height, the last layer being veal; then roll them in a caul, and tie or sew them up ; put them into a stewpan, with slices of ham and veal, parsley, shalots, two cloves, one of garlic, pepper, and salt, a little stock, and one glass of white wine; let it stew slowly; when done, take off the caul, wipe off the fat, skim, and strain the sauce; add a little cullis, lemon juice, and chopped parsley, and serve over the olives. Veal Olives.—Cut some thin slices from the fillet (if it is large, one slice will be sufficient for three olives) ; rub them over with yolk of eggs, strew on them some bread crumbs, mixed with parsley chop- ped, lemon peel grated, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; on every piece lay a thin slice of bacon, it must not be too fat; roll them up tight, fasten them -with small skewers, rub the outside with egg, roll them in the bread crumbs, &c., and lay them in the Dutch oven, and let them brown, without burning; they will take a long while doing; some prefer frying them. Serve the following sauce over them: Thicken a pint of good gravy with rout, add ketch- up, Cayenne, and pickled mushrooms, and boil this for a few minutes. Forcemeat balls may be added. Veal Olives a la blade.—Take two pounds of veal, boat it very fine, as for forcemeat, and mix it with the yolks of two eggs, two anchovies, half a pound of marrow, a few mushrooms, either fresh or pickled, half a pint of o_vsters, some thyme, sweet marjoram, parsley, spinach, lemon peel, salt., pepper, nutmeg, and mace, finely beaten ; let the whole bo thoroughly well

STU 484 STR Strawberry Jam.*—Gather the scar- let strawberries when perfectly ripe, bruise them well, and add the juice of other strawberries ; take an equal weight of lump sugar, pound and sift it, stir it thoroughly into the fruit, and set it on a slow fire at first, boil it twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises; pour it into glasses, or jars, and when cold, tie them down. ^ , Strawberry Marchpane*—Take tw0 pounds of sweet almonds, two pounds and a half of sugar, and a pound of picked strawberries. Beat the almonds to a fine paste, and mix them with the sugar (boiled to petit boule); crush, and strain the juice of the fruit, which add to the almond paste and syrup ; stir the mixture well, set it on hot ashes, and continue stirring until the paste is sufficiently done; this may be proved by laying a piece on the back of your hand; if it may be re- moved without its sticking, it is enough ; when cold, spread it over a slab, and cut it of any size and shape you think proper.

Whisk the whites of eighteen eggs to a firm froth, to which add a pound and a half of powder sugar, stir them together as lightly as possible; then mix them with the strawberries. Pour the whole into a croustade, and bake it an hour in a moderate oven ; when done, irlaze it, and serve g Strawberry Tart.-Pick, and put into a basin two quarts of the best scarlet strawberries, then add to them half a pint of cold, thick, clarified sugar, and half a pint of Madeira, with the juice of two or three lemons; mix these well to- gether, without breaking the strawberries, and put them into a puff paste, previously baked; be careful to keep them very cool. STURGEON.—Of a good sturgeon the flesh should be white, the gristles and veins blue, the grain even, with a few blue veins, and the skin tender. Sturgeon (Baked)*.—Clean, and take the skin from a small sturgeon ; split it along the belly, without separating it. Lay^it in a large baking-dish, season it with salt, pepper, pounded sweet herbs; moisten with oil, lemon juice, and a bot- tle of white wine. Put it in the oven, baste it frequently ; make it a nice colour, and serve it with its own gravy.

Put it into a fish-kettle, with a rich court-bouil- lon, grated bacon, or butter. It requires more seasoning than any other fish ; put therefore plenty of sweet herbs, and salt; set it on the fire, and put fire on the lid; moisten it often ; when done, drain and serve it with an Italiemte, to which add the liquor, with a bit of butter. Sturgeon Cutlets en Papillotes. Having cleaned and skinned the fish, cut it into cutlets, about an inch thick; put a bit of butter into a pan, lay in the cutlets, set them on the fire, and turn them.

When done, take out the fish, strain the liquor, take off the fat, add three spoonsful ot espaonole, reduce you sauce, pour it into a dish, and serve sturgeon on it. ,_BoiI a slice StuuciFON (Gnllade of )• -fv of sturgeon in a small saucepan, some slices of bacon, bay leaves, salt,

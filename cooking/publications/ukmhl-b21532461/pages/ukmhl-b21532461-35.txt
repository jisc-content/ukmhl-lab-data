While baking, whip the whites of two eggs, and mix two ounces of powder sugar with them, and cut four ounces of sweet al- monds into slips (shortwise) ; mix them also with two ounces of powder sugar and a spoonful of white of egg whipped. In three quarters of an hour take out the cake, and if it be firm and well coloured, cover it with the whipped egg and sugar, and on that strew the almonds equally, pressing them in, that all may be coloured alike. This operation must be performed as quick as possible, and when done, turn the cake out and cut it in four slips (lengthwise), and then divide each into six parts lozenge- shaped ; this will give you twenty-four cakes, which must be arranged in stars on jmur dish, six to every star. They may also be cut in two lengths instead of four, and these divided into fifteen small pieces’ and then, with a paste-cutter, formed into crescents. The ingredients, and the pro- per quantities for this cake, are as follows : six ounces of flour, the same of powder sugar, three ounces of sweet and bitter almonds, six yolks, and two whole eggs, six ounces of butter, two of sugar mix'ed with the whites of two eggs whipped, four ounces of cut almonds added to the sugar and eggs, a spoonful of brandy and a grain of salt.

BLA BLA 72 Black Puddings, Scotch Way.—Chop off tlie head of a goose, save the blood ; stir it till cold, then mix it as above directed with groats, spice, sweet herhs, salt, and beef suet, chopped; take tho skin from the neck, pull out the windpipe and fat, fill your skins, tie them at both ends. BLACKBERRY Wine.—Put full ripe blackberries into a large vessel with a cock in it, pour on as much boiling water as will cover them, and as soon as the heat will permit, bruise them well with the hand till all the berries are broken; cover them, and in about three or four days, when the berries rise to the top, draw off the clear part into another vessel; add to every ten quarts of the liquor one pound of sugar, stir it well in, and let it stand a week or ten days to work. Draw it off through a jelly-bag. Steep four ounces of isinglass in a pint of sweet wine for twelve hours, then boil it slowly till dissolved, put it in a gallon of the blackberry juice, boil them together, and put altogether ; let it stand a few days, and bottle. BLANC.—A mixture of butter, salt, water, and a slice of lemon ; also as fol- lows : Cut a pound of beef suet, and the same of fat bacon into dice, half a pound of butter, the juice of a lemon, salt and pep- per, one or two onions, a hunch of parsley, a little thyme, a bay leaf and spice, and well boil it. Blanc.*—Take half a pound of the beef fat, half a pound of bacon, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, two carrots, two onions cut in half, a hunch of sweet herbs, a few bay leaves, the juice of a lemon, some salt, whole pepper, and two glasses of stock, and boil the whole for some time, and strain ; it will be then fit for use. Blanc.*—Put one pound of grated bacon, one pound of fat, hall a pound ot butter, two lemons cut in slices, and the white taken out, two hay leaves, two cloves, four -carrots cut into dice, four onions, and a very small quantity of water, into a sauce- pan, and boil tho whole till it is reduced. You must take care to keep stirring to prevent your blanc from catching; when all the moisture is sucked up and tho fat is melted, moisten it with water ; add some clarified salt, let it boil, and skim it ; it is then ready for use. BLANC-MANGE.—To one ounce of picked isinglass, put a little water, boil it till the isinglass is melted, with a bit ot cinnamon; put to it three quarters of a pint of cream, two ounces of sweet almonds, six bitter ones blanched and beaten, a bit ot lemon peel, sweeten it, stir it over the fire, i let it boil, strain, and let it cool, squeeze i in the juice of a lemon, put into moulds ; | and garnish to your fancy. Blanc-mange may be coloured green by i adding spinach juice ; red, by a hit of cochineal in brandy, let it stand half an | hour and strain it; yellow, with saffron. Blanc-mange, Diablotins aux Avelines.— Pound and blanch six ounces of filbert nuts, and heat them up with three glasses of scalded cream ; squeeze them through a napkin to extract as much milk as pos- i sible from your almonds ; then gradually pour it upon two large spoonsful of rice flour, and beat it well together, taking great care not to let it be lumpy, adding three ounces of sugar and a very small quantity of salt; put it to turn over a mo- derate fire, and dry it for forty minutes until it becomes quite a stiff thick paste ; then put it on a dish and leave it to cool; when cold, roll it into strips, cut them into small pieces about the size of a filbert, and as you cut them roll them into balls and lightly sprinkle them with flour. The whole being thus prepared, place some of them in a small cullender, and put the cullender into batter, so hot that the dia- blotins will immediately catch (this batter should have been standing on the stone for two hours), and become of a nice dark colour in almost an instant. Then take your cullender out of the batter, put your balls in a napkin, roll them in powdered sugar, and serve on a very hot plate. Fry the remainder of your diablotins, serving them hot and hot. Blanc-mange (Dutch).—Put a pint of cleared calf’s-foot jelly into a stewpan ; mix with it the yolks of six eggs, set it over a fire, and whisk till it begins to boil ; then set the pan in cold water, and stir the mixture till nearly cold, to prevent it from curdling, and when it begins to > thicken, fill the moulds. Blanc-mange a la Fvan^aiseP—Blanch | one pound of sweet and a score ot bitter | almonds : drain them on a sieve, and after- wards dry them, by rubbing them in a napkin; pound them in amortar, continually moistening them with half a tea-spoonful of water at a time, to prevent their oiling, t When they are pounded as fine as possible, take them out of the mortar, and put them 1 into a pan; then with a silver spoon beat up youralmondsgradually, with five glasses of filtered water ; after this, spread a nap- kin over an oval dish, and put your almonds upon it; then gather up the corners of your

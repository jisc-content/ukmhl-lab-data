SAU 469 SAU roots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celery, also sliced ; put all these into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon ; cover it close and let it stand on hot ashes for sometime; then add equal quantities of white wine and good broth, place the stewpan in the bain-marie, and let the sauce simmer for four hours, when it may be strained for use. Be careful not to put in so much of any single ingredient, that its flavour may predominate over the others. Sauce (Brown).*—Take a pound or two of steaks, two or three pounds of veal, lean ham, some pickings of fowl, carrots, and onions, put all these into a saucepan with a glass of water, and set it on a brisk Are; when scarcely any moisture remains, put it on a slow fire, that the jelly may take colour without burning; and as soon as it is brown, moisten it with stock (or water), add a bunch of parsley and green onions, two bay leaves, two cloves, and some champignons, salt it well, and set it on the fire for three hours, then strain; dilute a little rouse with your liquor, and boil it an hour over a gentle fire, take off all the fat, and run it through a tammy. Sauce (Carrier).*— Scrape a small stick of horseradish, cut an onion or two in thin slices, put these into a sauce-tu- reen with a little vinegar and whole pep- per; set the tureen in the drippingpan under a shoulder of mutton whilst roast- ing ; serve this sauce quite hot with the meat. Sauce a la Diable * — Mince half ; dozen shalots very small, wash and presi out all the moisture ; then put them int< a saucepan with a glass of vinegar, a clovi of garlic, a bay leaf, and some veal glaze i educe it to nearly a jelly, moisten it witl a little good gravy; add pimento butter and a spoonful of olive oil.

In the mean time put the knuckle into a saucepan with four or five carrots, as many onions (one stuck with cloves), and two ladiesful of consom- me ; set it on a brisk fire that the liquor may reduce to a jelly, as soon as this jelly begins to take colour, pour on it the liquor from the other saucepan to dissolve the jelly gradually; then make it boil. Dilute some roux with the above liquor, and add it to the meat with some champignons, a bunch of parsley, scallions, and two bay leaves, skim it when it begins to boil, and again when the roux is added, put in more consomme or roux, according as it is too thick or too thin. When it has boiled an hour and a half, take off all the fat; and when the meat is quite done, strain the sauce through a bolting-cloth.

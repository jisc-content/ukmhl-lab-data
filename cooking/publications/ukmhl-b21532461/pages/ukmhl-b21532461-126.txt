Cabbace and Cheese Soup a la Provencale. —Cut a large cabbage into quarters, and, after blanching, boil it in water; when three parts done add a quarter oi a pound of butter and the requisite seasoning. Grate half a pound of gray ere, or Parme- san cheese. Prepare, also, some very thin slices of bread, and, two hours before din- ner, make the soup in the following man- ner : Take a metal or earthenware tureen that will stand the fire, and that can be used at table; first, put into it a layer of grated cheese, then one of cabbage leaves, previously boiled and dried on a cloth; next, some of the slices of bread, then those of cheese, commencing again with cabbage, &c. alternately, the upper layer of all being of sliced cheese. Having thus filled the tureen within two fingers’ width of the top, pour on its contents about half a pint of the water in which the cabbages (after beingblanched) were boiled, making tho cabbage broth penetrate to the bottom of tho tureen, by piercing its contents in several places with a knife; then place the tureen on a stove of moderate beat, letting tho soup simmer, without stirring, for more than an hour. When the soup is ready for table, the cabbage broth will have been all absorbed ; some persons, conse- quently add more hot broth to itat the mo- j ment of serving; but the true method of serving it a la Provencale, is to send it up | dry, using with it, at table, only the finest j oil. Cabbage Pudding.—Take two poundsof beef suet, as much of the lean part of a leg of veal; take a little cabbage and scald it, then bruise the suet, veal, and cabbage together in a marble mortar; season them with mace, nutmeg, ginger, a little pepper and salt: some green gooseberries, grapes, or barberries;—in winter, some verjuice; mix them all well together, with the yolk3 of four or five eggs, well beat; wrap up all together in a green cabbage leaf, tie it in a cloth ; an hour will boil it. Purple Cabbage to pickle.—Take two cauliflowers, two red cabbages, half a peck of kidney beans, six sticks with six cloves of garlic on each stick; wash all well, give them one boil up, then strain them in a sieve, and lay them leaf by leaf upon a large table, and salt them with bay salt ; then lay them to dry in the sun, or in a slow oven, until as dry as cork. Cabbage Ragout.*—Take the half of a middling-sized cabbage, boil it for half an hour, and then change it in cold water; squeeze it well, and take out the heart; cut the cabbage in small pieces, and put it into a stewpan with a slice of good butter; turn it a few times over the fire, and shake in some flour; put in sufficient gravy to give colour to the ragout; let it boil over a slow fire till the cabbage is done, and re- duced to a thick sauce; season it with salt, coarse pepper, and a little grated nutmeg : serve under any meat you think proper.

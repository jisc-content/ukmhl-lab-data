It also should be eaten sooner after it is killed. As England does not produce sufficient cattle for consumption, large importations are made ever year. In 1872 the value of oxen and bulls imported alive from France was 12,939, and in 1875 it was ^260,991 ; and from Germ.any, in 1872, it was ^917,269, and 1875, ^1,074,318; so that the importation from France is enormously on the increase. In addition to these amounts there were importations of salted meat from America to the value of ^277,317 in 1872, and of ^346,469 in 1875. The total weight of cured beef im- ported from all places was 215,581 cwts. The value of the cows and calves imported from Germany was ;£i57j393 in 1872, and;^338,28i in 1875 ; so that our chief foreign supply of living oxen, cows, and calves, comes from Germany. Large cargoes of fresh beef are now being brought to this country in steamers from America and Canada in large compartments specially fitted up, which are freely supplied with air cooled down to 38°. It is found that this temperature keeps the meat as well as a lower one, without so much risk of its becoming bad on being removed from the compartment. The value of fresh meat imported in 1876 was £\77,7SAi against .£97,343 in 1875. Mutton is obtained from sheep {ovis artes). This animal, unlike the ox, is not believed to have been in- digenous here, but to have been introduced into Europe from Africa. The quality of mutton varies with the breed, age, and food of the sheep, the finest in flavour being obtained from the mountainous districts of Scotland and Wales and the downs of England. These sheep are also leaner than those fed in Lancashire, and are of a different breed. Sheep can live well on pasturage, which is not sufficient for oxen, and are therefore bred largely on poor lands. The value of sheep and lambs imported from Germany in 1872 was £^929,791, and in 1875 ;£^62,72o; so that, although the importation of oxen, veal, and salted beef has increased, that of sheep has decreased. A considerable increase has, however, taken place in salted and fresh meat, not being pork or beef, and therefore chiefly mutton, as in 1872 the weight was only 55,354 cwts., whilst in 1875 it was 144,954 cwts. The total weight of preserved meat—beef and mutton —imported in 1872 was 350,729 cwts., and in 1875 171,373 cwts. Mutton hams come from Australia, and are good eating. In addition to the above, a cargo of living sheep has very recently been brought from Canada in very good condition. Pork is the flesh of the swine or hog {sus scro/a), which is derived from the wild hog—an indigenous animal of Britain, crossed with the foreign breeds of China, Africa, Spain, and Portugal. The flesh is enclosed in a layer of fat, which when melted down forms lard ; so that in this respect it differs from that of other animals. If is one of the most useful animals for food which we possess, as it will live on almost any food, and can readily be preserved by salting. It is also very savoury, and when young is delicate, although even then difficult of digestion. Pigs are subject occasionally to a disease known as measles {Trichina spiralis), so that uncooked hams, bacon, or sausages, should never be eaten. The number of swine imported from Germany has much decreased since 1871, when it was 128,188, whilst in 1872 it was only 4,711, and in 1875, 10,050. The quantity of salt pork brought from America and Germany has, however, somewhat increased, as the value from the former country in 1872 was £^300,032, and in 1875 £36^,272 ; and from Germany ;^56,264 in 1872, and £^67,218 in 1875. The value of baco7i and hams imported from America in 1872 was ;£3,458,55o, and in 1875 it reached the enormous sum of £^5,469,662 ; whilst the imports from Germany in 1872 were 0^7^523,927 against £^1,339,024 in 1875 : so that we received nearly seven million pounds worth of these articles of food during 1875. In 1876 this large total had increased to ;£8,554,229, being an excess of more than a million and a half sterling in one year. American bacon loses in cooking a large propor- tion of its weight, as does also the pickled pork, in con- sequence of the pigs having been fed upon acorns. There are three qualities of pickled pork imported into this country : “ mess,” which consists altogether of sides ; “ prime,” of three shoulders, without feet and other joints ; and “cargo,” of 30lbs. of head, four shoulders, and other joints in each barrel. Venison is obtained from the deer {Cervus), of which there are three kinds in this country—the red deer {Cervus Elephas), which is the largest, and rarely found wild in England ; the fallow deer {Cervus Dattia), which is smaller and paler than the former, and is the kind used for stocking our parks ; and the roe dter {Cervus Capreolus), which has become very scarce in Scotland, and is not met with except in certain districts of the Highlands. The male red deer is called a hart, and the female a hind ; the male fallow deer a buck, and the female a doe. The red deer and the roe-buck are indigenous. Venison affords but a very limited food supply, but it is much esteemed, especially the haunch ; when obtained from a wild animal it is more difficult of digestion than from a park deer. The flesh of the Goat {Capra Hircus) is not much eaten in England, but is more frequently used in Wales, where it is considered nearly equal to venison. The flesh of the kid is tender, and considered by many as a delicacy, but has not much flavour. The milk is richer than that of the cow. Amongst the novelties which have been imported from Australia is the meat of the Kangaroo. It much resem- bles rabbit in colour and flavour, and the tail produces a capital soup, which is prepared in Australia and sent here in hermetically-sealed tins. CALISTHENICS FOR LADIES.—III. FREE EXERCISES {continuedfrom f. 66). The following elbow exercises will be found to be of great service in obtaining a really good carriage, and curing round shoulders :— 1. Assume the same position as in No. i of chest exercises. Force the right elbow down four times to A (Fig. 19), and up four times to C, then repeat with the left, then alternately, then together, four times each. 2. Place the hands on the back of the hips (Fig. 20), and throw the elbow forcibly backwards. Repeat ac- cording to the usual course, four times each. 3. Interlace the fingers firmly against the back of the waist (Fig. 21), standing erect the while, then thrust down the interlaced hands as far as possible. Repeat four times. Next pass the interlaced hands (the palms front) to the right side in a line with the waist, and draw them down sharply, and return to the first position. Repeat on opposite side, and alternately, taking care that the movements are rapid and act on the shoulders. 4. Clasp the hands together, and place them on the waist in front, the backs of the hands forward, the elbows bent at right angles (Fig. 22). Carry the hands four times to B and back, then four times to c and back, and so on to D and E, and finally, alternately to B and to D, clapping the palms together with a slight noise at each return to the waist. 5. Place the interlaced hands, with the back of the hands upwards, on the top of the head (Fig. 23). Throw

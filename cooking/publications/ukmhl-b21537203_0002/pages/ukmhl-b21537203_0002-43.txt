CASSELL’S HOUSEHOLD GUIDE. ^ “ CALISTHENICS FOR LADIES.—I. The word “ calisthenics ” is derived from the Greek, “ kalos,” beautiful; and “ sthenos,” strength; the object of calisthenic exercises being to secure physical beauty by developing the limbs and muscles of the human frame, and making the joints flexible, thereby giving strength and muscular action, which, if well directed and regular, in- vigorates the system. Exercise is now recognised to be as great a necessity in woman’s education as in man’s: we are learning that many bodily defects and much of her weak health is attributable to the want of it; more especially in youth, when the frame is growing. Nine women out of twenty have one shoulder larger than the power, and ensuring a graceful carriage, erect bearing, and freedom to the figure. In the olden time the Greeks set this physical education before the mental; and within the past few years we have begun more particularly to recognise the import- ance, with regard to women, of such training as shall confirm their health and perfect their beauty ; for, as Ruskin tells us, “ The highest refinement of that beauty is unattainable without splendour of activity and delicate strength.” Helplessness and inactivity are no longer looked upon as feminine virtues. Lack of exertion leads to irregular other, many pursuits, such as reading, writing, and draw- ing, tending towards this ; and physical exercise is ab- solutely necessary to counteract such tendencies, curing as it does many deformities of mind and person, render- ing the soft, flexible tissues firm and strong, and making weak, delicate constitutions robust. The advantage of calisthenics to a narrow-chested girl is untold, for bodily organs unpractised naturally become weak, and general weakness of the whole system follows. Such exercises must, however, be carried out under a system; irregularly conducted, they do more harm than good. The constitution must be coaxed, not strained ;

Then the best roast possible in season or choice of two, and a salad ; a first-rate vegetable, a slice of really fine ham, to some a most fitting accompaniment; two choice sweets, one of which may be iced ; a parmesan souffle, a sweets, herring-roe on toast, or a morsel of sav0UI7- fine barely salted caviare, pale and pearly grey, which may be procured in two or three places at most in town, will complete the dinner. For dessert, which may be ushered in with a couple of companion ices of delicate texture, the finest fruits in season to gratify both eye and palate and for light amusement after; or simply nuts in variety, and dry biscuits ; nothing between the two is tolerable, and little more than the latter is really wanted ; and for decorative purposes the resources of flowers are now unbounded, to say nothing of autumnal tints for rich variety in season. But it may be admitted that the diminished number of sweet entremets strengthens the plea for a supply of delicious fruits, rendering the dessert useful and agreeable as well as ornamental. And now that dessert is over, let me say that I do not admit the charge sometimes intimated, although delicately, by foreigners, of a too obvious proclivity Dessert.

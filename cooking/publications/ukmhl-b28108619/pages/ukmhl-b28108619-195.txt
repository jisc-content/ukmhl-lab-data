189 Food Elements in Fish. water, and cannot live out of it, the proportion of that element in the animal’s structure exceeds only by a small amount the proportion which is present in land animals. In other words, the solid constituents of fish as a class, and there are important exceptions here and there, are but little less in weight than those of land animals already described. In one hundred pounds of fish without bone, from seventy-five to eighty-five are Water and water, or rather more than three- solids in quarters of the whole; leaving, say, about twenty pounds of solids as a mean estimate. Of these, about twelve to eighteen pounds are nitro- genous compounds. The most important, or flesh- forming principle, is less in quantity than in meat, and there is a rather larger proportion of gelatine. The proportion of fat varies greatly. The saline matters are pretty constant, and moderate in quantity. The comparison can be more easily made by means of the following table :— Analysis in General Terms of the Composition of the Flesh of a Healthy Land Animal not Arti- ficially Fattened, and Omitting the Bones.

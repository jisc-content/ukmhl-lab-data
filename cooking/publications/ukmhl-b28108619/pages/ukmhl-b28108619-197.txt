Fish Compared with Flesh. 191 We may now arrive at an approximative estimate of the place which fish occupies as Value of fish nutrient material among the other pro- wit^that^ ducts which the animal kingdom offer of meat, to men. Fish is inferior to flesh, not in the quality, but in the quantity of certain constituents, viz. the proteids, or flesh-formers, of which it contains fully a third less than ordinary meat. It contains more gelatine, which, although a nitrogenous product, is much inferior to “ albumen,” and can only partially in this restorative quality, although the solids present are larger in quantity in “fish-tea” than in that of meat, being chiefly gelatine. I have had the following experiments performed in the most accurate manner, which will show in part the nature of the chemical difference:— One pound of rump-steak, one pound of turbot, each without skin and bone, the former freed from fat, were thus separately treated. The flesh was passed twice through a mincing-machine, and sufficient cold water to cover (one pint) was added. After standing one hour, the mass was heated to boiling point, and allowed to simmer ten minutes, then strained through calico, and the contents of the strainer washed with water : a little floating fat was removed (in the case of the beef). Each of the liquids was evaporated on a water bath to the consistence of a soft extract. Beef-product. Weight of extract, 276 grains or 3-94 per cent. Of this product, 5 per cent, was gelatine. Fish-product. Weight of extract, 396 grains or 5-6 per cent. Of this product the gelatine amounted to 2rS per cent.

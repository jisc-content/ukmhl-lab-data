Varieties of Salad. 185 beans, peas, cauliflower, and other greens, may all be employed thus : combined and garnished accord- ing to the maker’s taste, which there is abundant opportunity for displaying. Salads also may be varied and made more substantial by the addition of small fillets of sole or trout, or the flavour may be heightened, if desired, by morsels of haddock, sardine, etc. Well known and appreciated as the Salade de ligumes * always is at a Paris restaurant, most persons here would prefer the vegetables simply sliced, so as to preserve some of their natural form and texture, rather than cut into innumerable small cubes, as usually presented. In all cases, such salad should be kept very cool, and be dressed immediately before serving in warm weather. * Salad of Cooked Vegetables. The French salad of cold cooked vegetables, Salade de legumes, is made as follows :— Take 4 ozs. of carrots cut in squares of about a quarter of an inch; 3 ozs. of turnips cut in the same way; 4 ozs. of small green asparagus cut in pieces ; 4 ozs. of peas ; 4 ozs. of French beans cut in squares like the turnips and carrots. Boil each of these vegetables separately in about a quart of water, with a teaspoonful of salt ; when cooked strain them on a cloth ; let them cool, and then place the French beans at the bottom of a salad bowl. Arrange the other vegetables in little heaps around, first the carrots, then the peas, then the turnips, then the asparagus, so as to alternate the colours, and so on again. The rest of the peas and asparagus may be placed in the centre, and sprinkled with a spoonful of chopped ravigote (fresh tarragon, chervil, parsley, and chives). Serve with oil and vinegar apart.

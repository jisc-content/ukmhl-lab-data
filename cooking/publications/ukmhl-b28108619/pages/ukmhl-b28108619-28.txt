We find the proteid element abundantly in lean meat, the muscle of animals, where it is known as “ myosin,” also in the blood and other parts as “ fibrin.” There are, moreover, two modifi- cations of nitrogenous compounds allied to, but not identical with, true proteids, viz. “ gelatin ” and “chondrin,” in bones and cartilage respectively. Proteids are largely present in eggs, forming “albu- men,” or what is familiarly known as the “white of eggs ; ” and in milk as “ casein,” the nitrogenous from vege- tables. constituent of cheese.* Again, in wheat, and existing therefore in bread, in smaller proportion as “gluten ;” and in the leguminous seeds (peas and beans) abundantly, as “ legumin,” which is almost identical with “ casein.” 2.

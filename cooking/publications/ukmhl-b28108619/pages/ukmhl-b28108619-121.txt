Braising, the Complete Process. 115 that the flesh falls from the bones, and can scarcely be cut. It is equally certain that it Caution. will not be so, although it will be deliciously tender, provided that the rules above given respecting the temperature are followed. The third principle in braising is not generally considered essential to the process, although it is un- doubtedly the last refinement necessary to produce a first-rate example. It is that of partially browning or half-roasting the portion also ; and this may be accom- plished in two ways. The legitimate or original way of doing this, is, to have well fitted to the braise-pot a sunk copper or iron cover, in which some hot cinders or charcoal are placed, towards the end of the process, when the braise is nearly finished, in order to transmit downwards a scorching heat to the top of the portion which is uncovered by the liquid in the pot below. The upper surface of the meat thus obtains that browning of the surface which is the crowning addi- tion to other flavours, before referred to as “ the taste of the fire.” In treating it thus, the portion should be covered, especially if a fowl, with a piece of white paper, which serves to shield a delicate morsel from a too fierce heat. The other and inferior way is to very lightly roast the meat, before putting it into the pot to braise, and so dispense with the hot cinders or charcoal on the cover; but this hardens the flesh, and tends to prevent the juices penetrating it, and cannot be recommended. It may be seen, then, that a braise in which no

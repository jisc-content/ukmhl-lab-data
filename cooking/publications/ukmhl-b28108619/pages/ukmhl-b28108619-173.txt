Cooking of Vegetables. 167 d la Paysanne, is to add first butter as before, salt and onion ; and then stew slowly in a fair quantity of stock, with lettuces, finely sliced, some sugar, and a shred or two of parsley, if desired. Almost any peas may be rendered tender and appetizing if thus treated. Again, haricots verts sautfc an beurre, is a favourite mode of cooking them ; but no super- Frenchbeans fluous butter should appear when they “sautes, are served ; the quantity allowed in which to toss them for a few minutes on a brisk fire, after boiling, should amount to no more, according to the rule, than a tenth part by weight of that of the vegetables themselves when dry.* But who does not know that it is common enough, both in town and province throughout France, to be supplied not only with French beans, but other vege- tables, saturated with butter, rendering them for most English stomachs, at all events, hazardous, and to some tastes repulsive. The natural inference from all this is, that cer- tain French methods are desirable, and their success is remarkable, when—as we have already seen in * Some persons who have not studied practical cookery may not quite understand the French term sauter, or the correspond- ing English term, “ toss.” It means, to fry lightly or partially in butter, using a shallow pan, and, moving the material to be fried, or, rather, “ tossed,” so as to avoid the production of a temperature high enough to brown the surface—a condition which is intended to be produced by frying proper, as before ex- plained (p. 133) to take place, by immersing the material in heated oil.

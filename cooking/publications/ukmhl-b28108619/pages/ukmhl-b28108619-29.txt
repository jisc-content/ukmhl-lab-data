All these must be present in the food supplied, and are obtained in most forms of food from both animal andvegetable sources(see note,p.4i). Meantime, as a result of chemical changes which take place in every portion of the body How through the assimilation of all these utIlized- elements, chiefly by oxidation, heat is produced ; while not only the proteids, but also the fatty matters and the carbo-hydrates of our food, as well as the inorganic constituents, are utilized in the repair of wasted tissues. Thus we may regard the human body as a complex and highly organized machine, adapted A cqmplex to execute work of varied but specific machine, kind, but one which is self-supplying fngandPly by means of food, and also automatically rePairm£- regenerates itself in order to maintain a condition of good repair. Thus, any material which is competent to supply

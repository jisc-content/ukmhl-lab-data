A Practical few words of explanation are necessary directions. jn reiation to the temperature of the fat which forms the frying bath, a matter of importance to ensure satisfactory results. When a bath of melt- ing fat is placed on the fire and the temperature has risen to 212° some bubbles come to the surface with a hissing sound ; these are due to a small portion of water, inherent in the solid dripping, especially if it has been clarified previously with hot water, so fre- quently necessary, which, being converted into steam, rise until all is got rid of. This is not the boiling of the fat, which is now tranquil, and when the temperature has advanced much higher, to something like 340°, a slight vapour is given off. If the fat is permitted to become much hotter, smoke appears, indicating a degree of heat to be avoided, and that the fat has reached what is called the boiling point, when it decomposes and spoils. Before this is reached, the heat should be tested by putting in a slip of bread, which if browned in a few seconds, a sufficient temperature has been attained, and the bath is ready for use. The above remarks apply equally to the temperature of any oil used for the same purpose. The principle on which suc- cess depends is, that at the moment of contact with the almost boiling fat or oil, a thin film of every part of the surface of the fish or other object Effect of high temperature,

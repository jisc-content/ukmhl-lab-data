Food and Feeding. 276 must, of course, be a savoury one, which the palate receives, being thus rendered “clean,” prepared to rest—or perchance to relish the last glass of wine by the delicate savoury morsel which terminates the menu. I desire to ask special attention to the fact that Haveomitted numerous popular dishes have been omitted—and purposely so—from these menus, simply for the reason that they are well known, and can therefore be adopted at pleasure by way of addition or exchange. Thus, none of the joints, such as sirloins, rounds, haunches, saddles, loins, shoulders, etc., have been named, with perhaps a single exception only. Every- body is familiar with English joints, which have been on this account excluded from a list necessarily so restricted as the limits of only thirty-two menus demand. For the same reason, I have not included in them turtle in any form, nor curries ; nor such special soups as mock-turtle, mulligatawny, hodge- podge, split-pea,* giblet, water-souchets, and fish soups ; nor whitebait, nor the fresh-water fish, carp, tench, dace, pike, etc.; nor among sweets, tarts, ices, sorbets, and the farinaceous puddings, custards, etc., nor have I named the preliminary oysters, which the most familiar dishes, such as “joints,” “turtle,” * ‘ special soups,” and fish, oysters, etc., to save needless menu writing-; * Our common split-pea soup, wholesome and agreeable in winter, with dried mint and tiny croutons, is wholly unknown in France ; the dried green peas, termed fiois cass/s, only are used for similar purposes there.

Illustrations to follow. 263 The essentials, then, of a dinner reduced to its lowest term are— The lowest term essential for dinner. 1. Preliminary . . Soup only: or fish only, if soup dis- agrees, or is objected to. Both, il desired. Meat alone ; or fish in its place, if soup only has been taken; or the etitrde alone if lighter food than meat is preferred. 4. A Roast .... A roast bird of some kind. 5,6, and 7. Entremets. A vegetable ; sweet, or savoury—one of each only, or two only, as preferred. 2 and 3. The Meat and entree. Examples of moderate menus to follow for each month in the year. In order to illustrate the foregoing remarks, I shall now furnish a few examples of small but complete dinners ; which are easily reducible, however, to the “ lowest term,” by the omission of a dish or two on the principle laid down. In each menu a choice of soups, fish, entrees, roast and sweet entremets, are given ; constituting, in fact, the menus of two dinners. Such a double menu is sketched from the materials most in season for each month in the year, making twenty-four dinners in all. I have ventured to do so because the sugges- tion has been so frequently made that practical illustration of the principles advocated should be appended, and also because it appears possible that a few examples may, perhaps, be of some slight Menu for each month.

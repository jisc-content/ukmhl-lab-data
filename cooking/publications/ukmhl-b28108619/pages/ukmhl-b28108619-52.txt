And from various other grains are obtained by fermentation and distillation, several forms of ardent spirit. Vinegar, best when produced from the grape, is also largely made from grain. Millet, dhoora, and buckwheat are all lower but useful members of the cereal group, and feed large populations in Eastern Africa and India. The legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, form a valuable aliment, containing more proteids (“ legumin ”) even than the cereals, but with fat in small proportion, while starchy matter and the mineral elements abound in both groups. The tuber finds its type in the potato, which Tubers contains far less of proteids than rice, and roots. much starch, and almost no fat, few mineral salts, no less than three-fourths of the weight being water ; the same may be said of the yam also. The roots may be illustrated by the beet, carrot, parsnip, and turnip, all containing little nitrogen, no fat, but much sugar, and water in very large proportion. Derived from roots and stems of foreign growth, we have arrowroot, tapioca, and sago, all pure starches and destitute of nitro- gen. Fatty matter is abundantly found in the olive, which supplies a large part of the world Oils and fat.

Food and Feeding. 230 Continental nations of commencing either midday “ Hors- ctijeilner or dinner by eating small d oeuvres;” portions of cold pickled fish, of raw vegetables, of highly flavoured sausage thinly sliced, etc., to serve, it is said, as a whet to appetite. This custom reaches its highest development in the za- the “za kuska of the Russian, which, consisting kuska ” of of numerous delicacies of the kind the Russians. ,. , . .. , , r , mentioned, is sometimes to be found occupying a table in an ante-room to be passed between the drawing-room and dining-room ; or, and more commonly, spread on the sideboard of the latter. The Russian eats a little from three or four dishes at least, and “ qualifies ” with a glass of strong grain spirit {vodka) or of some liqueur, before taking his place at the table. Among these savoury pre- liminaries may often be found caviare in its fresh state, grey, pearly, succulent, and delicate, of which most of the caviare found in this country is but as the shadow to the substance. I have no hesitation in saying, after much con- r k sideration of the practice of thus com- on “ hors- mencing a meal, that there is no good d oeuvres ; ” warrant for it on the part of individuals endowed with fairly good appetite and digestion. For them, both pickled food and spirit are un- desirable, at any rate, on an empty stomach. And if appetite and digestion are wanting, the stimulant of the hors-d'oeuvres is not only unnatural but decidedly prejudicial. Rational means to regain Caviare.

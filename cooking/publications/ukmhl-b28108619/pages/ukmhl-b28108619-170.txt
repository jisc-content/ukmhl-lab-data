Food and Feeding. 164 Vegetables served as “entremets.” sultanas boiled, mushrooms, olives, truffles. In the same way chestnuts are admirable, whole, boiled, or roasted, and as a pur£e freely served, especially in winter, when vegetables are scarce; serving also as farce for fowls and turkeys. While such vegetables as green peas, French and young broad beans, celery and celeriac, asparagus, seakale, cauliflower, spinach, artichokes, salsify, vegetable marrows, etc., are worth procuring in their best and freshest condition, to prepare with especial care as separate dishes.* And here, again, the distinctive principles, already French and referred to, of French and English cuisine, Veatment of are iUustrated in relation to the cooking vegetables; Gf vegetables ; and again, let me add, not always to the disadvantage of our own system. * A hint about boiling asparagus is worthy of mention, since the proper method is rarely followed by English cooks. Asparagus of the stouter sort, always when of the “giant” variety, should be cut of exactly equal lengths, and boiled standing ends upward in a deep saucepan. Nearly two inches of the heads should be out of the water—the steam sufficing to cook them, as they form the tenderest part of the plant; while the hard stalky part is rendered soft and succulent by the longer boiling which this plan permits. Instead of the orthodox twenty minutes allotted to average asparagus lying horizontally, in the English manner, which half cooks the stalk, and over- cooks the head, diminishing its flavour and consistence, a period of thirty to fifty minutes, on the plan recommended, will render fully a third more of the stalk delicious, while the head will be properly cooked by the steam alone. One reason why it is not uncommon to hear the best produce of the fields of Argenteuil insufficiently appreciated here, and our own asparagus preferred, is, that the former is rarely sufficiently cooked at English tables.

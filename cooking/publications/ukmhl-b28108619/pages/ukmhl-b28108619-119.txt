ii3 Cooking by Thermometer. Explanation of Illustration on Page 112. Fig. 1 is used in large braising pots, as for a ham. Range of temperature from 6o° to 220° Fahr., so as to safely cover the boiling point 212° when required. The usual range for “ slow cooking ” is marked on the scale as lying between 130° and 1750. Its length is eight inches not reckon- ing the ring at the upper end. Fig. 2. (A) is a smaller instrument with a range of temperature from 120° to 220° Fahr., for use in a small saucepan or shallow stewpan. (B) represents a metal socket in which it stands upright, so that the temperature may be read with ease. In hashing a few slices of meat, for example, the temperature should never exceed 135° to 140°, at which heat no hardening takes place, and this is the best kind of instrument to employ. In its socket it is five and a half inches in length. H

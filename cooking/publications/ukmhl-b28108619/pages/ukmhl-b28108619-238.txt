Recently the use of this bivalve has greatly diminished owing to the undoubted fact that typhoid or enteric fever has, not infrequently, been produced by eating raw oysters taken from beds near shore, where they have been contaminated by sewage from a neighbouring town or village. Danger on this point may be averted by following the practice of several of the leading London fishmongers, who put the oysters as soon as they arrive from the beds into salt water to “ scour ” for twenty-four hours. By this process the intestines are completely emptied, and any dangerous matter they may have contained is eliminated.

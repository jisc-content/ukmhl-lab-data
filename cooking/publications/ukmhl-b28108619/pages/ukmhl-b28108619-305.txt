Gonffd's Directions, Rdsumd. 299 for three or four hours. But the vegetables and herbs should be removed and set aside when the former are well cooked, after which they must not remain in the pot, the meat only remaining until the end of the process. The liquor is now to be poured off into a perfectly clean vessel until cold, and any fat thereon removed. It ought to be clear, with an agreeable odour and colour. The quantity of soup resulting should be diminished about one-third by the process, and should suffice for six or eight persons. It is generally served at table now with a few full-sized thin slices of freshly cooked carrot, turnip, and leek, in which case it would be more properly termed a la paysantie. The addition of a rather thin slice of the crust of a loaf, one to each plate, constitutes it a cro&te an pot. The bouillon, or good clear beef-broth, produced by the pot-aufeu, is the basis of all brown soups. And a decoction of veal and veal bones, with fowl and vegetables as before, similarly treated in all respects, is, or should be, employed as the basis of all white soups, clear or purees. A consomme is a stronger decoction of meat than the bouillon, with a fuller body and flavour. Compared with the receipt for the pot-au-feu, and using the same quantity of water, beef bones, and vegetables there required, add half the weight of veal (meat and bone) as that of the beef, and proceed in all particulars of boiling, skimming, simmering, etc., as for the pot-au-feu. It is to be presented perfectly clear when finished, and, if necessary, must be clarified in the usual manner (for which, see a good cookery manual). Or a consomme may be made by using the beef botiillon in place of water, adding the additional veal recommended above, and repeating the process of the pot-au-feu just referred to. For a consomme of game, adopt the pot au-feu

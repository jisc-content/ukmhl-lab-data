All the inimitable fragrance of coffee is an effect of the same remarkable change of which partial carboniza- tion by heat is the agent. Then the burning of almonds, and the roasting of nuts in all their variety, furnish further illustrations of the principle. So, carbonized wood, for the sake of the essential oils which are burned and volatilized in the rising smoke, the. odours of which are thereby changed and communicated to salted meats and fish, thus con- ferring upon them a peculiar aroma with a slight bitterness of taste, as we all so well know, in smoked bacon, hams, tongues, herrings, haddock, and salmon.

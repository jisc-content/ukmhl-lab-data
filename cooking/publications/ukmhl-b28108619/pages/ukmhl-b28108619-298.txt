EPILOGUE. As a worthy and interesting subject, I introduce a brief notice of one of the most celebrated authorities and writers on the culinary art, and at the same time a philosopher and a man of great literary power. Needless to say that such was Brillat Savarin. The most complete translation of his celebrated work, entitled Physiologie du Gout, is that published in 1884 (by Nimmo and Bain), with fifty-two original etchings by A. Lalauze: an Edition de Luxe. Anthelme Brillat Savarin was born on April 1, 1755, and died in Paris on February 2, 1826. Occupied with municipal and judicial duties, he found time above all things for that study and cultivation of the taste which has made his book a classic. Monselet has said of his early manhood—“ Without ambition, inclined to study and sufficiently rich, he seemed to lead the peaceable and happy life of a country lawyer, who has a knife and fork laid for him in all decent country houses. Until he was thirty-four years old, people saw him often going to and fro in the fertile country of Bugey, sometimes sitting down in well-provisioned inns, where strings of poultry were roasting, sometimes opposite to some jovial cure, some- times coping with noisy huntsmen. From that time there remained to his memory those precious receipts that he was to leave to posterity—the fondue, the omelette with tunny, the stuffed pheasant, etc.”

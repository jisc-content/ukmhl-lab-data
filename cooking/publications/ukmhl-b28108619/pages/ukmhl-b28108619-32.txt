No such treatment of the beans will produce an equivalent, and their special proteid “ casein,” like cheese, its congener in milk, is then quite unsuitable. The lower animals, living on vegetables only, have stomachs and allied organs widely differing from our own, specially adapted to deal with vegetable foods, and to convert them into flesh. Thus it is that oxen and sheep, exclusively vegetable feeders as they are, consuming only grass and a few roots, produce largely and rapidly the necessary proteids in the form of flesh, as man himself is wholly incapable of doing, and meat thus becomes for him a concentrated food of exceeding value, admirably adapted to his digestive system. The need for an Valuable . c ,. ... to the abundant supply of easily digestible labourer. proteids to sustain the hard-working inhabitants of the British islands is obvious. And hence it is, that almost all those who ordinarily supplied, it appears that while four-fifths of the albumen con- sumed from animal sources are digested (81 parts in the ioo), not quite half (46-6 in the 100) is digested of albumen derived from vegetable sources, cereals, legumes, etc. This is cor- roborated by other experiments made by Rubner. “ Food in Health and Disease,” by I.

Wheat and its congeners, which rank highest in quality, had been distinguished, in the form of bread, as “ the staff of life,” long before the physiological demonstration of the fact had been attained. Wheat, oats, rye and barley, maize and rice, are the chief members of this group, wheat containing most of the nitrogenous or flesh-forming material, besides abundance of starch, a very small amount of fat, together with sufficient saline and mineral elements. 1.

Evil of Drinking Habits. 19 action of the mind is forgotten altogether. So it often comes to pass that at middle age, Evils of when man finds himself in the full early indi- gestion thus, current of life’s occupations, struggling for pre-eminence with his fellows, indigestion has become persistent in some of its numerous forms, shortens his “staying power,” or impairs his judg- ment or temper. And, besides all this, how apparent it is that few causes are more potent than an incom- petent stomach to engender habits of selfishness and egotism. A constant care to provide little personal wants of various kinds, thus rendered necessary, develops the growth of these sentiments, and they influence the man’s whole character in consequence. On the other hand, the poor man, ad- and 0ther- vancing in years, shows signs of damage wise caused- to his constitution from continuous toil with inade- quate food, the supply of which is often diminished by his expenditure for beer, which, although mostly noxious, he regards as the elixir of life. Many of this class are prematurely crippled by articular disease, etc., and become permanent inmates of the workhouse. But abstention from alcohol in all its forms has been of great service, and might be far more largely extended, with incalculable advantage to the com- munity, for the practice is clear and defined. The “total abstainer” means what he says, and does not take his daily or occasional glass of wine or beer unless strongly advised by his doctor, and by no means always then.

6 Preface. more fully the principles on which they are employed, the objects aimed at, and the rationale of each procedure. The subject of “slow cookery” is one which I have long practically studied with much interest, and I have recorded the result of various experiments. I am satisfied that in cooking food derived from the animal kingdom the longer application of low tem- peratures will render it more easily digestible and nutritious, as well as more agreeable than the old methods. By these latter I mean the long-established custom of cooking “joints” by the highest tempera- ture obtainable through boiling water, or by radiation from a fire in the course of two or three hours, viz. the familiar processes of “boiling” and “roasting” respectively. I append to this edition a brief reference to that great man whom France produced in the eighteenth century—at once Philosopher and Gourmet of culti- vated taste—and the famous twenty aphorisms with which he prefaced his work, and which he regarded as embodying the principles to be carried out in the large volume devoted to his subject. 35, Wimfole Street.

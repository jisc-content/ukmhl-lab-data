One of the most important practical results of “slow cooking” is that, in hot summer weather, by its means a small joint, such as a neck, loin, or even a small leg of mutton, from a sheep killed yesterday, can be served at table to-day as tender as if it had been hung for ten days in cold weather. It has merely to be put into a large saucepan filled with boiling water, which must be maintained at the boil- ing point for about five minutes only. Then the vessel is to be removed to a corner of the fire or hot- plate, or over a gas ring, and the temperature be per- mitted to fall to about I70°-I75°, and remain so for a period of time at least three times the length of that usually ordered by the cookery book for boiling the joint in question—say for four or five hours instead of one or i J for a small one. It may then be served as it is ; or, better still, be well sprinkled with the raspings of a French roll, placed in the oven, and be basted with a little butter until it is covered with a brown crust, which renders it an appetizing dish, giving it to some extent the flavour and aroma of a roasted joint.

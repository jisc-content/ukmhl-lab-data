Notes about Truffles; Caviare. 279 eaten and appreciated the fresh truffle, it appears to me that eating them when preserved is more the result of fashion, than of much gratification derived from the act. Something of the same .... „ Caviare, kind may be said of caviare. Once eaten in its freshest and finest condition, say in Moscow, and the black herring-flavoured, small- seeded caviare, commonly found here, becomes uneatable. But the pale grey and fresher kind does, to a satisfactory extent, recall the delicious qualities of the best Russian product when fresh. And this latter may sometimes be found at Berlin, a distance it can reach by rail without injury.* emphasizing the change. The mode of preserving the truffle recently adopted, in air-tight tins instead of the well-known thick bottles—so contrived as to look large, and to hold but a few ounces—is far more successful than these in preserving the fine scent and nut-like texture of the tuber. Cobbett, of Pall Mall, and Morel, of Piccadilly, have effected this improvement. But during the short winter season of the fresh truffle, each receives a direct supply by rail from the Perigord district at least three or four times a week. * It may be added also, that a fairly good, not highly salted, caviare is now less difficult to procure than it formerly was, thanks to increased facilities for rapid transit. It should be obtained as soon after arrival here as possible, in time for immediate use.

Fish Sauces and Garnish. 199 ingredient there should be a concentrated liquor made from the trimmings of the fish shell-fish as itself, with the addition of a few drops garnish, of lemon juice, and strengthened, if necessary, from other sources, as from shell-fish of some kind. Thus an everyday sauce of wholesome and agreeable quality is easily made ; and this principle finds its highest illustration in that admirable dish, the sole, with sauce au vin blanc of the French, or, as associated with shell-fish, in the sole a la normande * This is well served in Paris, of course, but it can be found in perfection on the coast of France, especially in the south, due in part probably to the abundant garnish of shell-fish, which are found in finer condition and fresher there, while * A leading review, in a friendly notice of the above when it first appeared, spoke of a “ mistake ” made by me in “ imagining a sole cn matelote normande to be a simpler dish than it really is.” I certainly intended the sentence in which it is named, and which is reprinted above without change, to signify my high respect for this finished dish, and if I have not made this clear, I hereby desire to do so. It was named to show that the principle of employing the juices of fish, and especially of shell-fish, as a sauce, finds its highest expression in the sole d la normande. Turning to my copy of Jules Gouffd’s classical work, pp. 621-22 of the original edition, Paris, 1867, I see that he remarks specially thereupon, “ La recette que j’indique n’a pour base comme on a pu constater, que l’essence de poisson,” pre- cisely warranting what I had stated. It is understood, of course, that these juices are combined with a good veloutt to make the sauce, and that it may be garnished further to any extent, according to the luxury demanded by the guest, or for the entertainment.

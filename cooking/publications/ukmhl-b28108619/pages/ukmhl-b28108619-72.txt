Food and Feeding. 66 corn and flour from foreign countries, while more of our own land is yearly devoted to grazing purposes. The increased import of foodstuffs from abroad during forty years is shown by the following figures. In the year 1869 the amount of overseas Corn and Flour consumed by every man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom was nearly 156 lb. In 1888 it had risen to over 220 lb. ; in 1904 to 293J lb., though in 1907 it had dropped to a little over 279 lb. per head. Bacon and Ham from the same sources amounted to only 2^ lb. in 1869, but had risen to over 16 lb. in 1907. Our imported Butter that was only 4^ lb. per head in 1869, had nearly doubled in 1888, and in 1907 was 10J lb. Imported Cheese was consumed in 1869 at the rate of nearly 4 lb. per head, and in recent years has averaged about 6 lb. Of Eggs laid abroad we used in 1869 to consume about 14J each, but we now demand about 50 per head. At the same time our importation of Meat has enormously increased. In 1889 the Dead Meat brought into this country was valued at the ports at £18,601,309; but in 1908 this value had gone up to £41,763,430. It is true that in the same period, owing to Government restrictions, the Live Animals intended for our food have dropped from £10,360,807 to £6,617,810, but on adding together the amounts for each period the increase is seen to be still enormous. Other imported items of the national bill of fare cost us in 1908 as follows : Butter and Margarine, £26,163,771 ; Cheese, £6,684,203 ; Eggs, £7,183,112 !

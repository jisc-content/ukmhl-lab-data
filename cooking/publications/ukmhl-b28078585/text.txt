HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. I am so often asked by young housekeepers what their weekly books ought to come to, that it may be of help to many if I give what I have usually found to be the proportion of each book to the total sum allowed for the week’s housekeeping. The butcher’s book comes to about ij of the whole amount. „ grocer’s „ i „ dairy „ l „ baker and confectioner’s ,, l ,, „ greengrocer’s „ TV „ fishmonger’s „ „ These figures are not absolutely correct because I wish to avoid smaller fractions, and also the amounts will vary a little from week to week; but, on the whole, the proportions are what they should be. It so entirely depends on the kind of household that has to be provided for, as to the cost of catering for it, that it is difficult to give any hard and fast rule for the amount to be spent on food. The usual thing is to allow 105. a head per week where the ex- pense has to be considered. In a large household this allowance2 HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. is a liberal one for ordinary good plain living, and with a little skill a very good table can be kept on it; but for young married people, where the household is small, it is hardly sufficient unless economy dictates its necessity. It always costs much less in proportion to feed a number than a few. But taking as an example a household of six—a husband and wife, three servants, and usually one visitor—and a weekly allowance of ^3, the books will average as follows : £ s. d. Butcher . . x o o Grocer . . . 0120 Dairy . . . o 12 o Baker and confectioner . 070 Greengrocer . . 046 Fishmonger . . 046 One week the books may be less and another more, but at the end of a few weeks this should be the result. In the baker’s book is reckoned all the flour that is used. If the bread and cakes are made at home, which is strongly advised, then this book will come to less, but the grocer’s and dairy book will be a little more, as you must add to them the fruit, butter, and eggs used in making cakes. Tea and coffee are included in the grocer’s book. Butter and eggs are always troublesome items to control, as there is practically no limit to the amount that can be used in cooking. It is therefore absolutely necessary, where economy has to be studied, to order only a certain quantity of each every week, and then to regulate your cooking accordingly. To help do this I have divided the list of sweets and puddings under three head- ings : those that contain eggs and butter, those that contain only eggs and no butter, and those sweets and puddings that contain neither. Under this last heading are milk puddings, as the small amount of butter required is insignificant and is also not indispensable. Good cooking takes an immense amount of butter, but it is easier to regulate the use of it in soups and made-3 HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. up meat dishes and vegetables than in sweets. In households where people keep their own poultry and grow their own vege- tables this will make a great difference to their weekly books, and something must be deducted from the weekly allowance for the maintenance of the garden and poultry yard ; that is to say, the allowance per head must be less than the regulation io.y. a week. In first-class private schools, where the number to feed is anything over forty, a most excellent table of the kind required can be kept up at 6s. a head per week. This is partly because large quantities of provisions are cheaper than small quantities, and partly on account of the plainer food required, but it is the truest economy to buy the best of everything—-that is as regards quality ; I do not mean the most expensive things. In large institutions of other kinds the catering could be provided at still less a head and yet be very good, but it would be plainer than that required now- a-days in first-class preparatory schools. The aim of a good housekeeper should be to nourish those under her care in the best possible manner. It is not sufficient that the food should be “ nice,” though that is a sine qua non. She must observe quietly the particular kind of food that suits the constitution of the people she has to provide for. It is a pretty general rule that men dislike twice-cooked meat, and many do not care for sweets. The first difficulty can often be obviated by cutting off a small portion of the joint before it is cooked, and using it up in some of the ways given in this or in any other cookery book. If the man or men in your household do not care for sweets give them an extra course of something else,—one day a good savoury, another an entree, another a vegetable course, and always soup or fish. For yourself have a little pudding made. Nearly all the recipes for them can be halved or made in even less quantities. If you have only women to provide for you will probably find they much prefer dainty made-up dishes to joints, and would rather have poultry and game than meat, and they will certainly like sweets.4 HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. Children, again, are hard to feed. They are very dainty, and though this trait must on no account be encouraged, the difficulty can be almost entirely avoided by care on the part of the house- keeper. They require very little meat; that meat should not be twice cooked; and greasy things must be scrupulously avoided. Soup is good for them, but they will not eat it if it is highly seasoned. Everything must be very plain, but very good, for children. Milk puddings are made more palatable to them if a fruit sauce is served with the pudding in a separate tureen, and it is also very good for them. Fruit sauce can be made from jam if no syrup is handy. There is a great art in good housekeeping. Nourishment is, ot course, the primary object of food, and must lie at the root of all your endeavours, but there is much to be learnt by the inexperienced in the proper combination of food. Variety is not essential to nourishment, but it is very expedient, and if it were not wanted there would be no need of any cookery books. In composing a menu you must consider the whole as well as the details, choosing for the various courses those things that go best together. There is not space to go thoroughly into this question here, and I can only give the broadest and most elementary rules. These are not to let two white courses follow each other ; that is, if you have white soup let the fish be fried. Do not have boiled meat and boiled fish, or boiled meat and a boiled pudding. If you have pastry in the meat courses avoid it in the sweets. If you have a rich kind of meat, let it be followed by a fruit sweet in some form or other. The taste of things is improved by the dishes that precede and follow them. Harmony must be, in fact, observed in the composition of a menu, though the effect may be heightened and improved by the introduction of some discords in the shape of very indigestible but very delicious compounds.5 SOUPS. With a little care soups are easily made, and recipes are given for many kinds that are good, nourishing, and economical. The more elaborate recipes for soups can be found in any of the ex- cellent cookery books already published. Excellent nourishing soup can and should be made in every household from vegetables, and bones and trimmings of meat and poultry that are too often wasted. These should be put daily in the stock-pot, which should always be kept going. For particulars see “ How to make a Stock-pot.” The liquor that fresh meat or poultry has been boiled in makes good stock. If you, in this way, always keep sufficient stock in the house, there are endless varieties of soups quite simply and easily made. This will be proved by glancing through the recipes. Lemco is. very useful, and a judicious use of this extract will be found invaluable in making soups and gravies. How to make a “Stock-pot.”—Ingredients : 2 or 3 carrots, a very small bit of turnip, 1 onion stuck with 2 cloves, a sprig of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs tied together, a stick of celery, 12 peppercorns, a slice of lean bacon or ham ; bones of any kind, cooked or uncooked ; a crust of bread, trimmings of meat or poultry, salt and pepper ; either arrowroot, sago, vermicelli, or rice. First provide yourself with a brown earthenware stew-pot with a lid, the size you will require for your household, from two to six quarts. Put in the stew-pot the carrots cut into small pieces, a very small piece of turnip, the small onion stuck with two cloves, a sprig of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs tied together, a stick of celery, a dozen peppercorns, a slice of lean bacon or ham, bones of any kind, cooked or uncooked; a crust of bread, and trimmings of meat or poultry. The bones should be well cracked and broken up, and the marrow scooped out. Then fill the pot with cold water, stand it on the grate, and let it heat gradually. When it boils skim off all the scum, draw the pot6 SOUPS. back, and keep it simmering slowly for five or six hours. Strain the liquor through a sieve and let it stand till cold. All the fat can then be easily taken off. When the soup is wanted put the stock (from which the fat has been taken off) into a saucepan, about half an hour before it is wanted, with seasoning of salt and pepper. One teaspoon of arrowroot mixed smoothly with one tablespoon of cold water can be added to thicken the soup, or sago, vermicelli, rice, etc., according to the recipes for the same given later on in the book. Stock made in this way is sufficiently good for all ordinary purposes, and one teaspoon of Lemco, added to it just before it is served, will greatly improve the flavour. The same bones do for two days, but the vegetables must be fresh every day. To make the stock very good use a cow-heel, or part of one, in addition to the bones. Stock for Clear Soup.—Ingredients : 4 lbs. shin of beef, 2 oz. lean bacon or ham, 1 oz. butter, 1 onion stuck with two cloves, ^ a small turnip, 1 lump of sugar, 2 carrots, 1 head of celery, 12 peppercorns, £ blade mace, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, 2 quarts of water, bones and trimmings of poultry or meat. Rub the butter on the bottom of the stew-pot, and put the meat and bacon cut into small pieces also into the stew- pot, with half a pint of cold water and all the other ingredients. Cover the stew-pot and place it on a sharp fire, stirring its contents from time to time. As soon as the bottom of the stew- pan gets covered with a pale jelly-like substance, add two quarts of cold water and simmer gently for five hours. It must never be allowed to boil quickly, and the scum must be removed whilst it is cooking. It can be cleared in the usual way. Strain it through a hair sieve, and when cold remove all fat. To clarify Stock.—The whites of two eggs, i pint of water. Whisk the eggs well, taking care there should be no particle of the yolk with the whites. Whisk them with the water, and still whisking add them gradually to the stock, which must be just warmed. Place the soup on the fire, and when boiling whisk it7 SOUPS. well; draw it to the side of the fire and let it settle until the whites of the eggs become separated. Strain it through a fine cloth that has been dipped in boiling water. Two eggs are suffi- cient for two quarts of soup. White Stock.—2-J- lbs. knuckle of veal, 2 oz. lean bacon or ham, 2 carrots, 1 onion stuck with 2 cloves, 1 stick of celery, 12 peppercorns, i blade of mace, a bunch of herbs, i oz. of butter, 2 quarts of water, any poultry trimmings. Rub an earthenware stew-pot with the butter, and put in it the veal cut up into small pieces and the bones and trimmings of poultry, the ham, and half a pint of water. Put the lid on the stew-pot and simmer till the gravy begins to flow ; then add all the other ingredients and about two quarts of cold water. Simmer for five hours, skimming it occasionally. When nearly ready add salt to taste and strain through a very fine hair sieve, and leave it to get cold. White Stock (Economical).—The liquor that fowls or mutton have been boiled in makes very good stock for many white soups, such as artichoke, rice, celery, etc. Asparagus Soup.—2 quarts of stock, 50 heads asparagus, 1 onion, 2 small lettuces, a sprig of mint, a few spinach leaves, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. flour, cayenne and salt. Put half the stock and 30 of the asparagus heads and all the other vegetables into the stew-pot, and simmer till quite tender; then rub through a sieve with a wooden spoon, and put the puree into a saucepan ; add the re- mainder of the stock and the pepper and salt, and let it come to boiling-point. Just before serving thicken it with the flour and butter, previously mixed together. Boil the remaining asparagus heads by themselves, put them in the tureen, and pour the soup over them. Artichoke Soup (White).—3 pints white stock, 3 lbs. Jerusa- lem artichokes, 5 pint milk or cream, 1 small onion, cayenne and salt. Strain the stock and put over the fire to heat in a sauce- pan. Add the artichokes, which have been previously washed and pared and boiled till quite soft. When these have gentlySOUPS. cS stewed down to a smooth pulp put in the seasoning. Stir well, and when it has simmered for five minutes pass it through a strainer. Pour it back into the saucepan, let it again simmer for five minutes, taking care to skim it well, and stir to it the cream or milk, which must be warmed before it is added. Serve with crofitons of fried bread. Beef Tea.—Beefsteak or shin of beef i lb., water x pint, salt, i small onion stuck with 2 cloves, 6 peppercorns. Ever)' bit of skin and fat must be cut away from beef that is used for beef tea. It must then be shredded quite fine with a sharp knife and mixed thoroughly with the water in an earthenware stew-pot. If the beef tea is for a very delicate invalid it is best to use no seasoning but a little salt, which is added after it is cooked, but other- wise it will be greatly improved by the addition of a small onion stuck with two cloves, and six peppei-corns. Then the lid is replaced and the stew-pot put on the side of the stove to heat very slowly. It must be stirred from time to time. It should stand thus two or three hours and not even be allowed to simmer; it should then be gently boiled for fifteen minutes. The salt is added when the boiling commences. The beef tea should be strained into a basin and left to get cold. Then the fat, should there be any, can easily be skimmed off, and the beef tea can be heated in a clean saucepan when it is wanted. Celery Soup, Thick Brown.—3 heads of celery, I onion, 1 carrot, a very small bit of turnip, 1 egg, xT pints of stock, pepper, salt, sugar, 1 oz. of butter. Cut up the celery into pieces about an inch long and boil in salt and water till tender. Cut up the other vegetables small and fry them lightly in the butter. Add the celery and moisten with a little stock. Season with pepper and salt and a pinch of sugar, and rub through a sieve. Put the puree back into the saucepan with the rest of the stock and make it boiling hot, take it off the fire and stir in the yolk of an egg beaten up with a little cold stock. Serve with crofitons of fried bread.9 sours. Celery Soup, Cream of.—2 heads of celery, 2 oz. of butter, 2 quarts chicken broth, 2 oz. flour, 1 pint boiling cream, cayenne pepper, salt, nutmeg. Wash the celery, and cut the stalks into pieces about an inch long and boil them in salt and water for ten minutes, then strain off the water and put back the celery into a saucepan with the butter, salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg; cover the saucepan and boil slowly till the celery is quite soft, then rub it through a sieve and mix it with the chicken broth, and thicken it with 4 oz. of flour cooked in the butter. Boil it for about ten minutes, stirring constantly ; skim it and pass through a fine sieve. Put it over the fire again, and add a pint of boiling cream and a very small piece of butter. The stock that a fowl has been boiled in is quite sufficiently good for this soup. Crofitons of fried bread should be served with it. Chicken Broth.—Half a fowl, 1 blade mace, 1 quart of water, a pinch of nutmeg, \ an onion, small bunch savoury herbs, salt and pepper, and 6 peppercorns. Skin the fowl and put it into the stew-pot with all the ingredients, and simmer gently for 2 hours, carefully skimming the broth. Then strain it and put it aside till it is cold; then take off every particle of fat. When it 's wanted, warm up as much as is required, and season to taste. Hare Soup.—I hare, 1 lb. gravy beef, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 1 onion, 1 sprig of parsley, 1 bay-leaf, 12 peppercorns, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz. butter, 3 quarts water, 1 glass port wine. Joint the hare and cut it and the beef into small pieces. Put the butter into the stew-pan and fry the hare and the meat in it for a few minutes till they are nicely browned, then put in the vegetables, also cut into small pieces, and fry them slightly. Add the water, cold, and the other ingredients except the wine, and simmer gently for five hours. Pour off the stock, and when it is cold remove the fat. It is best to make the soup the day before it is wanted, and to let it stand all night. After the fat has been carefully removed, strain the soup into a saucepan, then take out the bones, and rub as much of the meat as you can through a sieve, and add it to the stock in theSOUPS. IO saucepan. When the soup boils thicken with flour if necessary, and add a wineglass of port wine, and salt and cayenne to taste. Some forcemeat balls should be served in the soup. Hare Soup (2).—Very good soup can be made with the re- mains of a jugged hare. Put all that is over of the hare into a saucepan with 3 pints of stock, let it simmer for two hours, strain it and rub the meat through a sieve. Put the stock and the puree back into the saucepan, season with cayenne and salt, add a wine- glass of port wine, make it quite hot, and serve with forcemeat balls. It may be necessary to thicken the soup with a little browned flour. Imitation Hare Soup.—1^ lbs. gravy beef, r oz. butter, 1 slice lean bacon, 1 onion, 2 cloves, 1 small carrot, 1 oz. flour, 1 bunch of sweet herbs, 1 dessert-spoon of mushroom catsup, 1 teaspoon of Harvey’s sauce, 1 quart water or stock, 1 bay-leaf, 6 peppercorns, a small piece of turnip, a sprig of parsley, 1 large wineglass of port or claret. Cut the beef into small pieces and flour them. Put the butter in the stew-pot and set on the fire to get hot, and add the onion stuck with the cloves and the flour. Then put in the bits of beef, and let them get brown. Add the water or stock, the vegetables and peppercorns, and the small slice of bacon. Simmer gently for 1-5- hours, and strain. Set it aside to get cool, and when cold skim off all the fat. Half an hour before the soup is wanted for use put in a saucepan, and just before it boils add the wine and sauces, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve with forcemeat balls made in the following way : Forcemeat Balls.—-2 tablespoons of bread-crumbs, I tea- spoon of chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon of chopped suet, £ teaspoon of dried herbs, | teaspoon of grated lemon rind, 1 egg, a little powdered mace. Mix all together with the yolk of an egg, and make into balls. Drop them into the soup, and let them simmer for ten minutes. Haricot Bean Soup.—1 lb. of haricot beans, 2 quarts stock, parsley, pepper and salt. Soak the beans for at least twelve hoursSOUPS. 11 in cold water. Drain them and boil for about i| hours in cold water slightly salted, or until they are very tender. Drain them again and rub through a sieve. Warm the stock and add the puree of beans, season with pepper and salt, and add one tea- spoon of chopped parsley. Boil up once more and serve. Croiltons of fried bread should be served with this soup. Julienne Soup.—2 quarts “stock for clear soup” (see page 6), 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 stalk celery. Scrape the carrots and cut the red part of them into straws an inch long. Scrape and cut up the turnips and celery also into straws an inch long.

Put the vegetables into the tureen and pour the clear soup, boiling, over them. Lettuce Soup, Cream of.—3 lettuces, 4 oz. rice, 1 small onion, 2 oz. of butter, ^ pint cream, 2 cloves, parsley, sweet herbs, mace, 2 quarts broth or white stock. Wash the lettuces well and drain them in a cloth, and then chop them rather fine, and put them in the stew-pot with 2 oz. of butter; cook for five minutes stirring slightly, and then add the stock, the rice (well washed), a bunch of parsley, a small onion stuck with two cloves, and about half a salt-spoon of powdered mace. Cover the stew-pot and cook for three quarters of an hour, then strain and pour into a saucepan. Just before it boils pour in the cream, season with salt and cayenne, let it nearly boil again, stirring all the time, and then serve. Crofitons of fried bread should be served with this soup. Lentil Soup.—1 pint lentils, 3 carrots, 2 oz. butter, 2 turnips, 1 Spanish onion or 1 head of celery, 1 sprig of parsley. After washing the lentils soak them all night in two quarts of water; then put them in the stew-pot with the water they were soaked in and set them on the fire. Add the other vegetables, which must be washed and cut up small, and a little salt. Boil till quite soft and rub through a sieve, adding boiling water as12 SOUPS. required ; return the puree to a saucepan, season with pepper and salt, stir in the butter, and boil a few minutes. Serve with crofitons of fried bread. Mutton Broth (for an Invalid).—i lb. scrag end neck of mutton (very lean), i onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, i pint water. Put the mutton into a stew-pan, pour over the water cold, and add the other ingredients. When it boils skim very carefully, cover the pan closely, and let it simmer very gently for an hour ; strain it, let it cool, take off all the fat from the surface, and warm up as much as may be required, adding, if the patient be allowed to take it, a teaspoon of minced parsley which has been previously scalded. Pearl barley or rice is a nice addition to mutton broth, and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients. When either of these is added the broth must not be strained, but merely thoroughly skimmed. Plain mutton broth without seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton, water, and salt together, straining it, letting the broth cool, skimming all the fat off, and warming up as much as is required. Mulligatawny Soup.—i fowl or i rabbit or 2 lbs. veal can be used for this soup with 2 quarts stock, 1 onion, 2 apples, 1 tablespoon of curry powder, 2 oz. butter, i pint cream, and a teaspoon of lemon juice.

Now heat the butter in the stew-pot, first fry the meat in it and then the apples and onion. Add the stock and let all simmer together about two hours, or until the meat drops off the bones. Strain the soup and put it into a saucepan. Cut up the meat into small pieces. Thicken the soup with flour ; add, just before serving, the boiling cream, lemon juice, and pieces of meat, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Boil some Patna rice as for curry, and let it be handed round with this soup instead of toast. Ox Tail Soup.—2 ox tails, 1 oz. lean ham, 1 carrot, r oz.SOUPS. }3 butter, g small turnip, i onion, i head of celery, i bunch sweet herbs, i bay-leaf, 4 cloves, 2 tablespoons of catsup, 12 peppercorns, 1 wineglass of port wine, 3 quarts water, salt and pepper to taste. Cut the ox tails in small pieces, dividing them at the joints; thoroughly wash them, wipe them dry, and fry in an earthenware stew-pot with the butter. Add the vegetables (which should be sliced into small pieces) and the herbs. The onion, a fair-sized one, should be stuck with the cloves, and not cut up. Put half a pint of cold water in the stew-pot, and stir over a sharp fire till the juices are extracted; then add the remainder of the cold water, skim well, and simmer very gently for four hours, or longer if the tails are not tender. Take the meat out; skim and strain the soup. Thicken the soup with one teaspoon of flour, season it with salt and pepper, the catsup, and port wine. Put back the' meat, simmer for five minutes, and serve. Pea Soup.—1 lb. good split peas, 2 quarts stock, a slice of lean ham or bacon, dried mint, seasoning. Wash the peas in two or three waters, and throw away all those that float; soak them for twelve hours, and then boil them in just sufficient of the water they were soaked in to allow them to mash easily. Put them with two quarts of stock and the bacon, and stew them gently in it for an hour; then rub the whole through a sieve, heat the soup again, clear it perfectly from scum, season with salt and pepper, and send it to table with a dish of crofltons of fried bread. A small dish of very finely crushed dried mint should be handed round with this soup. Green Pea Soup.—3 pints green shelled peas, a few sprigs of mint, 2 quarts of stock, a few spinach leaves, 1 lettuce, 1 onion, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. of flour. Put one quart of stock and all the vegetables, except half a pint of the peas, into the stew-pot, and simmer till quite tender, then press through a sieve. Put the puree into a saucepan, add the remainder of the stock, and season with pepper and salt; let it come to boiling-point, and just before serving, if the soup is not very thick, add the butter and flour,SOUPS. 14 which must have been well mixed together. Boil the half-pint of peas by themselves, put them in the tureen, and pour the soup over them. Plain toast should be served with this soup. Potato Soup.—3 lbs. mealy potatoes, 3 pints of stock (white is best, but ordinary stock will do), 3 onions, i pint of milk, 1 tea- spoon of parsley chopped fine, cayenne and salt and pepper. Strain the stock and put it to heat over the fire in a double sauce- pan. Boil separately 3 lbs. of potatoes which have been peeled, and three onions ; season with pepper and salt and cayenne, and boil till tender. When cooked rub them through a sieve and add them to the boiling stock. Just before serving add half a pint of milk. This must be done gradually, and the soup must on no account be allowed to boil after this is added. Then stir in the chopped parsley and serve with a dish of croutons of fried bread. Rabbit Soup.—Cut a few slices of ham (about 3 oz.) and cover the bottom of your stock-pot with it. Cut up 2 rabbits and put in the pot, and add a bunch of parsley, a little bit of thyme, 3 small onions, a blade of mace, and about half a pint of cold water. Put the lid on the stock-pot and let it stew very gently for an hour. Then add as much stock as you want soup, and let it boil for an hour. Take out the rabbits and strip the meat from the bones; beat it in a mortar quite fine, put it in the soup with the crumbs of a penny roll, and let it boil again for an hour. Rub it through a sieve, add half a pint of cream that has been boiled, put into a double saucepan to get hot, and add seasoning to taste. If meat is liked in the soup, a few choice bits of rabbit may be saved to put in it. Rice Soup.—6 oz. Patna rice, 2 quarts white stock, Vpint cream or milk, mace, cayenne, salt. Boil the rice in the stock, and then rub half of it through a fine sieve; put the stock in a double saucepan, add all the rice, and simmer gently for a quarter of an hour. Take the soup off the fire and add the cream gradually, which has been boiled separately; set theSOUPS. 15 saucepan again on the fire, and let it gradually heat, but not boil. Stir all the time, and season well. Sago Soup.—3 oz. sago, 2 quarts ordinary stock. Wash the sago in boiling water, and then by degrees add it to the boiling stock; simmer till the sago is dissolved. Scotch Mutton Broth.—3 lbs. scrag end neck of mutton, 4 pints water, 4 carrots and 3 turnips cut up into pieces, 3 onions, 2 tablespoons pearl barley, salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley. Cut up the mutton, dividing the bones, and trim off most of the fat. Put into the stock-pot with 2 quarts of water; as soon as it boils skim it well, and then simmer for an hour. Add the other ingredients and stew for three hours. About half an hour before sending to table add the minced parsley, salt, and pepper. Semolina Soup.—j lb. semolina, 2 quarts ordinary stock.

Cut up the veal (scrag end of knuckle is best) and the ham or bacon, which must be very lean, and put into the stew-pot with the water and the vegetables, • herbs, mace, and peppercorns. Stew gently till the liquor is reduced to about three pints, then strain it and set it aside till it is cold, when the fat can easily be skimmed off. Skin the fowl and wash it, and take away the dark spongy substance that adheres to the insides. Put the fowl in the stew-pot and pour the veal <broth over it; put the lid on the stew-pot and boil it gently for an hour, then lift out the fowl, cut off all the white meat, and put back the rest of the fowl into the stock-pot, and stew gently for one and a half hours. Pound the white meat you have cut off to the finest paste, and leave till wanted in a cool place, covered over with a basin. Season the soup that is still simmer-SOUPS. i6 ing on the fire and strain it, and let it get cold, and skim off the fat. Steep the bread in a little of the stock when it is boiling, and when it has simmered a few minutes drain the moisture from it and add it to the flesh of fowl, and pound together till they are perfectly blended, then pour the stock to them very gradually, and mix smoothly together; pass the whole through a sieve, heat it in a clean saucepan, stir to it three quarters of a pint of boiling cream ; if necessary add a little more seasoning, and thicken with three quarters of an ounce of arrowroot mixed smoothly with a little cold milk. » Spinach Soup.—Wash thoroughly 2 quarts of spinach, pick the leaves from the stalks, put them in a saucepan with x gill of water, put the lid on and let them boil; remove the lid and stir well to prevent them burning, continue the boiling for twenty minutes, then rub them through a wire sieve. Put in a saucepan 1 oz. of butter, 1 oz. of flour, stir over the fire till smooth, then add the puree and 3 pints stock ; boil until it thickens. Warm a gill of cream and add it to the soup; heat, but do not let it boil. Serve with fried croxltons of bread.

Put the tomatoes and water into a saucepan, allow them to cook slowly fifteen minutes, and pass through a sieve. Melt the butter in the sauce- pan, add the flour, and by degrees the liquor. Allow this to boil for three minutes to cook the flour, then add the sugar, salt, pepper, and cream or milk, or half of each. Heat, but do not let the soup boil after the milk is added, or it will curdle. Vegetable Soup.—1 head of celery, a few spinach leaves, 2 carrots, 1 turnip, 1 parsnip, 1 lettuce, £ small cabbage, f pint shelled peas, bunch of sweet herbs, 3 small onions, \ pint cream or milk, 1 oz. rice or potato flour, 3 oz. of butter.

Pour the soup through a sieve, and press the vegetables through with a wooden spoon. Dissolve the re- maining one ounce of butter in a saucepan, stir into it the rice or potato flour, add the vegetable puree, stirring well all the time. Stir over the fire till it boils again, and add salt and pepper and the cream or milk previously heated. Serve very hot, and with crofltons of fried bread. Vermicelli Soup.—i lb. vermicelli, 2 quarts ordinary stock. Put the vermicelli in the soup when it is boiling; simmer very gently half an hour, and stir frequently. 218 FISH. Fish when in Season.—Turbot and brill are always good. Cod is good all the winter from September to the end of March. Eels are good all the year except April, May, June, and July. Haddock is always good, except, perhaps, in the spring, when it is less good. Herrings are best in the autumn and winter. Mackerel should not be eaten from November to the end of March. Mullet are only good from the beginning of April to the end of September. Smelts are only good from November to end of May. Soles are always good, except in the early spring. Salmon is good from February to end of September. Whiting are good from June to end of April. Crabs must not be eaten in January, February, and March ; lobsters the same. Oysters are good in all the months that have an “ r” in them. Fish, and how to Choose it.—The eyes must be bright, the gills a clear fine red, the body stiff, and, though firm, yet elastic to the touch. The fish must not have a disagreeable smell. A good turbot is thick and fleshy. If the under side has a bluish tint it is not good; the colour of it should be a pale cream. Soles can be chosen by the same signs as turbot. Salmon and codfish are best when the head is small, the shoulders thick, and the scales of a salmon must glisten and be very bright. If mackerel are not fresh the bright green of their backs becomes a coppery colour, and they are then very unwholesome food. Prawns and shrimps should feel very stiff and crisp when they are freshly boiled, and the tails turned inwards ; when these relax and the fish is soft they are stale. Hen lobsters are best for soups and sauces on account of the coral, but the flesh of the male is best for eating. Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when they are opened : it the shells are apart ever so little they are losing their condition, and when they remain far open the fish are dead, and oniy fit to be thrown away. Small natives are the best.KISH. 19 To Clean Fish.—To clean fish properly requires scrupulous care, and it must never be so roughly handled as to bruise it. If fish is soaked too long in water it loses its flavour, so that care must be taken not to leave it longer than necessary in the water. The scales must be scraped off, and water poured over the fish to wash off all the loose scales; then empty the fish without opening it more than you can help; wash out the blood, and scrape it away from the backbone. The dark skin of the sole must be stripped off when it is fried, but left on for boiling. Whiting taste better with the skin left on, but usually have it taken off for frying. The gills of all fish must be removed. To know when Boiled Fish is Cooked.—When the flesh breaks away from the tail in a whole fish or from the bone in a portion of a fish, and the eyes loosen from the head, it is sufficiently cooked. Fat for frying Fish.—Fat for frying must be very good, whether it be butter, lard, or oil. Olive oil is the best ; lard is the most used, and is much better for this purpose than butter. Frying fat can be kept in a clean jar and used several times, but it should be strained each time it has been used. There must always be sufficient fat in the frying-pan to entirely cover the fish. The fat must be so hot that it has ceased to bubble, and be giving off a blue flame, before it is hot enough to put the fish into. A small piece of bread must be thrown into the fat to test the heat, and if it comes out golden brown it is ready for use. Burnt fat must not be used again. To keep Boiled Fish Hot for Table.—Never leave it in the water after it is done. Take out the fish and lay the fish- plate on a large dish, made very hot, and place this across the top of the fish-kettle; cover the fish with a clean cloth wrung out in boiling water, and over this put a tin cover. Just before the fish is wanted put the fish back in the fish-kettle of boiling water for an instant, and then drain it and serve immediately. Bloaters.—Cut off the heads and tails, open the bloaters at20 FISH. the back, take out the backbone, rub over with cold butter, and cook them in a Dutch oven before a bright fire, or fry them. To Boil a Brill.—A brill requires less cooking than a turbot, but is otherwise treated in the same way. Clean the brill, cut off the fins, rub with lemon juice. Lay it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it, and add i lb. salt to each gallon of water, and two tablespoons of vinegar. Bring it gradually to the boil, simmer very gently for ten to fifteen minutes, accord- ing to the size of the fish, and skim carefully. Serve very hot: garnish with slices of lemon and sprigs of parsley. Serve lobster, shrimp, or plain butter sauce with it. To Boil Cod.—Wash the fish and clean it very thoroughly, particularly the backbone. Lay it in the fish-kettle and cover with cold water mixed with salt in the proportion of 4 oz. to a gallon of water and two tablespoons of vinegar. Place over a moderate fire, clear off the scum, and only just keep it simmering. If the water boils away add a little by pouring it in at the side of the kettle. The fish will take from twenty to forty minutes, according to size. Drain it well and dish it up. Garnish with the liver and roe, parsley, and lemon. Oyster sauce, egg sauce, shrimp sauce, or plain butter sauce with anchovy can be served with this fish. To Boil Cods’ Sounds.—These should be well soaked in salt and water and thoroughly washed before dressing. They are considered a great delicacy, and may be either broiled, fried, or boiled. If they are boiled mix a little milk with the water. They take about a quarter of an hour to cook. Slices of Cod fried. —Cut the middle or tail end of the fish into slices nearly an inch thick, season them with salt and pepper or cayenne, flour them and dip into beaten yolk of egg and then into fine bread-crumbs, and fry in boiling fat till of a clear brown on both sides; drain well and serve. Garnish with fried parsley. Plain melted butter or anchovy sauce is served with this fish.21 FISH. To Boil a John Dory.—It is dressed in the same manner and served with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins must be cut off. To Stew Eels.—To skin the eel cut through the skin round the neck, and take hold of it with a rough cloth and draw it gently off. Then clean the eel without breaking the gall, cut off the bristles which run up the back, divide into pieces about two inches long, and lay these in strong salt and water for one hour. Dry the pieces well, and roll them in flour seasoned with pepper and salt, and fry a light brown. Let them drain till cold, then put them into a stew-pan with a bay-leaf, an onion stuck with two cloves, a bunch of parsley, an inch of lemon rind, and about half a pint of stock made from the trimmings. Let them simmer gently from twenty to thirty minutes; take them up and keep hot till the sauce is ready. Strain the gravy, thicken it with a little flour, add salt and cayenne, a few drops of essence of anchovy, and the juice of half a lemon ; let it simmer for ten minutes. Add a glass of port wine, make hot, strain, and pour over the pieces of eel in the dish. Garnish with sippets of toast. Fish Cakes.—Equal quantities of cold boiled potatoes and cooked fish are required for these cakes. Put the potatoes through a potato masher. Perfectly free the fish from skin and bone ; break it into flakes with a silver fork. Pound the fish and potatoes together in a pestle and mortar, and season rather highly with salt and cayenne, and a small pinch of mace and a few drops of anchovy sauce. Make into a stiff paste with one tablespoon of milk, half an ounce of melted butter, and the yolk of an egg for one pound of fish and potato. More or less milk and butter can be used according to the quantity of fish, but one egg is sufficient. Flour the hands lightly, and make into small round cakes ; use as little flour as possible in doing this. Brush the cakes over with the yolk of an egg and toss them in fine bread-crumbs, and repeat the process a second time ; if the cakes are not entirely covered they will burst in frying, as theyFISH. 22 will also be in danger of doing if much flour is used. Arrange the fish cakes in the frying basket, being careful not to let them touch each other. As soon as a thin blue flame can be seen rising from the fat plunge the basket into it, and let it remain until the cakes are a light golden brown ; take them out and lay them on kitchen paper on a sieve to drain. Let the fat get hot again, and put some very dry sprigs of washed parsley into the basket, and plunge into the hot fat for two seconds. Lay them a moment on the paper to drain, and serve on a very hot dish with the fish cakes. Fish Pie.—Remains of cold boiled fish, three or four potatoes boiled and mashed, a cup of melted butter well seasoned with anchovy or other fish sauce, one teaspoon of minced parsley, pepper and salt. Pull the pieces of fish apart with a silver fork, carefully removing all the skin and bones ; put it in a pestle and mortar and pound it a little with the other ingredients. Put it in a pie-dish and cover with a layer of mashed potatoes well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a small piece of butter. Cover the dish and set in a moderate oven till it smokes and bubbles, then remove the cover, and brown before serving. If the fish pie is made of cod or haddock, pickled walnuts are a great improvement to this dish, and should be served with it. Fish Mould Steamed.—Take a couple of small fresh haddocks or a large whiting, skin and bone them, and pound them in a mortar with ^ of a pint of white sauce, add one tea- spoon of minced parsley, two hard-boiled eggs chopped into neat squares, pepper and salt to taste, a very small teacup of bread- crumbs, and another of a pint of white sauce. Mix thoroughly, add the beaten yolks of two eggs and the whites whisked sepa- rately to a stiff froth ; fill a well-greased mould with the fish, and steam for an hour and a quarter. Turn out carefully and serve with white sauce round the mould. The fish can be steamed in several small moulds instead of one big one.23 KISH. To Bake Fresh Haddock.— For this dish it is best to have rather a large fish. First make some forcemeat. Take equal quantities of chopped suet and bread-crumbs (3 or 4 oz. accord- ing to the size of the fish), one teaspoon of grated lemon rind and one teaspoon of chopped parsley and thyme; add salt and pepper or cayenne. Bind these together with the unbeaten yolk of an egg, and if necessary a little milk. Clean and thoroughly dry the fish, fill it with the forcemeat, make three incisions with a sharp knife right across the back. Roll the fish so that its tail touches its head, and put it into a round pie-dish. Dredge with flour and put from 1^ to 2 oz. of butter, cut up into pieces, over it, and the juice of half a lemon. Bake in the oven from half to three quarters of an hour, or an hour if the fish is very large. Baste frequently. Serve in the pie-dish and pin round it a napkin. This is quite the nicest way of cooking a fresh haddock. To Boil Haddock.—Scrape, clean, and wash thoroughly. Lay the haddock in a fish-kettle with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and 4 oz. of salt to a gallon of water. If the -fish are small fasten the tails to their mouths. They will take from half to a quarter of an hour to cook. Serve with melted butter. To Fry Haddock.—Wash the fish and split down the middle and take out the backbone, sprinkle with flour and dry thoroughly in a cloth. Have ready about an ounce of butter melted in a frying-pan. Put the fish in the frying-pan, the white side near the fire first; when that is fried turn the fish and fry the other side. Sprinkle on it a little chopped parsley and some pepper and salt. Fry till it looks brown, and then serve very hot. To Fry Fresh Herrings.—Clean and scale the herrings; sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper, dredge with flour and brush over with beaten egg, and cover with coarse oatmeal. Fry in a little hot fat and drain well before serving. Another way isFISH. 24 to cut off the heads, split the herrings open, flour them, and fry. The roes should be fried separately. Kedgeree.—Boil 2 or 4 oz. of rice, according to the size of the dish required, as for curry. Pick the flesh of the fish from the bones, and break with a fork into flakes free from skin and bone; take equal quantities of fish and rice; melt a slice of butter in a saucepan, throw in the rice and fish, and stir all briskly together till the mixture is quite hot, seasoning it rather highly with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Have ready two slightly- beaten eggs, stir them into the kedgeree for a minute or two till the egg has set; serve very hot, piled on a dish. Kippers. -Put in boiling water for five minutes. Then drain well, put small pieces of butter on them, and place in a Dutch oven in front of a bright fire for ten minutes. To Boil Mackerel.—Cleanse the inside of the fish thoroughly, and lay it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it, A lb. salt to each gallon of water, and two tablespoons of vinegar ; bring it gradually to the boil, skim it well and simmer gently till done, which will be when the tail splits and the eyes start out. After the water boils it takes about ten or fifteen minutes^ or more if the fish is very large. Fennel sauce is usually served with this fish. Broiled Mackerel.—Cleanse the fish thoroughly and dry in a cloth ; cut off the head and tail and split the body open ; take out the backbone ; rub well with butter, and sprinkle with pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and a few drops of lemon juice. Broil in a frying-pan in which a small piece of butter has been melted. Put the white side of the fish next to the fire first, and when it is partly cooked turn it and let the other side brown. To Pickle Mackerel.—Clean and prepare the fish and wipe well in a cloth. Put the fish in a deep pie-dish with two bay- leaves, 3 doz. peppercorns, £ a teaspoonful of salt. Cover the fish with vinegar and water in the proportion of £ vinegar and £ water; put a plate over the top and stand in a slow oven an hour.FISH. 25 \ Mackerel that have been boiled can be used for this dish, but will only require to be in the oven for half an hour. Scalloped Oysters.—Open and beard a dozen oysters, and scald them for a second in their own liquor. Make a white sauce, into which some oyster liquor is poured, a few grains of cayenne, a salt-spoonful of anchovy sauce, a pinch of mace, and a squeeze of lemon. Boil this till it is cooked. Put the oysters into scallop-shells, pour the sauce over them, and strew bread- crumbs on the top, and place some little bits of butter all over. Brown them in front of the fire. Filleted Plaice and Dutch Sauce.—Brush over the fillets with beaten yolk of egg, dip into fine bread-crumbs, and fry in boiling fat; serve with fried parsley and Dutch sauce. The fillets should be arranged in a ring in the dish, and the sauce poured into the middle. To Fry Parsley.—Wash the parsley, dry well in a clean cloth, set in the oven for five minutes and then plunge into hot fat for one minute. The parsley should look green and crisp. To Boil Pike.—Scale and clean the pike. Lay it in cold water, and when it boils throw in 4 oz. of salt to every gallon of water, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. A middling-sized pike will take about half an hour, a larger one longer. Drain well and serve on a dish which has been already garnished with alternate heaps of very finely chopped parsley, the whites of two hard- boiled eggs minced, and the yolks rubbed through a sieve. A little of each of these ingredients should be put on every plate of fish when it is carved. A sauce of oiled butter should be served with this fish. To Boil Salmon.—Scale and clean the salmon with great care, and be especially careful to cleanse all the blood from the inside. Put 4 oz. of salt into each gallon of water and put it on the fire to boil, as salmon, unlike other fish, is cooked in boiling water to preserve the colour and set the curd. When the water boils put in the fish, and if it be a small one let it boil rather26 l-'ISM. fast, but if it is thick let it only boil gently. Be quite sure it is suffi- ciently cooked before you send it to table: 2 to 3 lbs. will take about half an hour to cook, 8 to 10 lbs. one hour and a quarter, small or thin fish less time. Cucumber should be served with salmon, and for sauce either oiled butter, lobster sauce, Tartar sauce, or plain melted butter and anchovy. Salmon Cutlets.—To every 6 oz. of cold boiled salmon add 2 oz. mashed potatoes, some white pepper, cayenne, salt and mace to taste, one egg, fine bread-crumbs, 1 oz. of butter. See that the fish is perfectly free from skin and bones, and pound it in a mortar; add the seasoning and potatoes, and the butter. Form the mixture into the shape of small cutlets, brush each one over with yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, and fry. Potted Salmon.—I lb. cold boiled salmon, 2 oz. clarified butter, white pepper, cayenne, salt, and mace. Pick the salmon from the bones with two silver forks, warm the butter, add the seasoning, and pound all together in a mortar till it is a smooth paste. Press into little pots, and, cover with clarified butter. Scallop-shells of Cooked Fish.—Remains of cold fish. For every half-pound allow 3 oz. of grated bread-crumbs seasoned with salt, cayenne and pepper, and grated nutmeg. Break the fish into small pieces with two forks, season it, and mix with it either some cold white sauce or one ounce of clarified butter; butter some scallop-shells, place a layer of seasoned crumbs at the bottom, lay in the fish, and sprinkle more crumbs on the top. Lay little pieces of butter on the top, and put the shells into a brisk oven. They will take about a quarter of an hour to do. Some people find it a very great improvement to sprinkle the top of the fish with Parmesan cheese instead of bread-crumbs. In any case butter must be put on the top. Smelts.—Draw them at the gills, as they must not be opened. Wash and thoroughly dry in a cloth. Dredge them with flour, dip into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into finest bread-27 PISH. crumbs. Fry them in a fish-basket in a saucepan of boiling lard. Dry them before the fire on a sieve on which several layers of kitchen paper have been laid. Serve with plain melted butter. To Boil Soles.—Cleanse and wash the fish carefully, cut off the fins, but do not skin the fish. Lay them in a fish-kettle with enough cold water to cover them, and allow 4 oz. of salt to each gallon of water. Let the water come gradually to a boil, and keep it simmering from five to ten minutes according to size. Drain the fish well and serve with shrimp sauce, lobster sauce, plain melted butter, or anchovy sauce. Fried Filleted Soles. —After the soles are filleted they are prepared and cooked precisely the same as soles, but Dutch sauce can be served with them if preferred to melted butter. To Fry Soles .—Skin and wash the soles, cut off the fins, and wipe them very dry, and let them remain in the cloth until it is time to dress them. Have ready some fine bread-crumbs (browned are best) and beaten yolk of egg. Dredge the soles with a little flour, brush over with egg, and cover with bread-crumbs. The soles must not be put into the frying-pan till the fat has ceased bubbling and is giving off a blue flame. There must always be sufficient fat (whether it be lard or olive oil) to entirely cover the fish. When the soles are cooked on one side turn them carefully and brown on the other. They take about ten minutes to fry, according to their size. When they are done remove care- fully from the pan and lay them on kitchen paper on a hot dish, so that all the fat drains away. Dish on a very hot dish, garnish with lemon and, when liked, fried parsley. Plain melted butter should be served with them. Soles with Mushrooms.—Fillet the soles and roll each fillet, keeping it in shape with a small skewer or tape. Put 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. salt, and 1 tea- spoon of lemon juice into the fish-kettle, lay in the fillets and bring them gradually to boiling-point. Then let them simmer very gently for ten minutes. Take out the fillets andFISH. 28 remove the skewers, and set them upright in a dish. Pour over them a sauce made as follows :—i lb. button mushrooms, i pint milk, 1 pint cream, 2 oz. butter, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, cayenne, 2 oz. flour, a little mace and salt. Mix the butter and flour in an enamel saucepan, stir till thoroughly mixed and smooth, then add the milk and cream and other ingredients, stirring all the time. It will take about ten minutes to boil. To Boil a Turbot.—Clean it, and then rub salt lightly over the outside to remove the slime, and rinse it. On no account remove the fins of a turbot, as they are considered a delicacy. To prevent the skin of the white side from cracking make an incision down the back of the fish. Rub the white side with lemon. Lay the fish in a very clean fish-kettle with enough cold water to cover it, and add £ lb. of salt to each gallon of water, and two tablespoons of vinegar. Let it gradually come to a boil, and skim very carefully; keep it gently simmering, and on no account let it boil fast, or it will spoil the fish. When the meat separates easily from the bone it is sufficiently boiled. Take it out and let it drain well, and dish it up. Garnish with slices of lemon and parsley. Lobster spawn, rubbed through a sieve, is sometimes added. Lobster sauce, shrimp sauce, or plain melted butter should be sent to table with this fish. After the water boils turbot takes from fifteen to thirty minutes to cook, accord- ing to the size of the fish. To Boil Whiting.—Clean and dry the fish, lay them on a fish-plate, and put them into water at the point of boiling; throw in some salt, a bay-leaf, and plenty of well-washed parsley tied together; let the fish just simmer for from five to ten minutes, and watch them closely that they may not be overdone. Large fish take longer. Serve parsley and butter sauce with them. Filleted Whiting. —These are cooked precisely the same as the whole fish except that they are never skinned, and Piquant sauce is usually served with them. To Fry Whiting.—Whiting are generally skinned, but they29 FISH. taste much nicer when the skins are left on. After they are cleaned and dried in a cloth their tails must be fastened in their mouths, dredge with flour, and egg and bread-crumb, then put in a frying basket and fry a clear golden brown in boiling lard. Drain them well and serve. Melted butter is the best sauce for this fish, or anchovy sauce. To Steam Whiting for an Invalid.—Place the fish in a steamer and steam for ten minutes if a small fish, and twenty minutes if a large fish. To Cook Whitebait.—These fish require great care to dress well. Handle as little as possible, and throw them straight into a cloth with three or four handfuls of flour, and shake the cloth well; then put into a bait sieve to get rid of the superfluous flour. The fish should be fried in a frying basket, and only left in the boiling fat for one or two minutes, as the fish must not be allowed to turn brown. Drain the fish, and serve piled high on a dish. Slices of brown bread and butter and cut lemon are served with whitebait. Bread-crumbs for frying Fish.—A constant supply should be kept to save time when preparing fish for frying. Put into a cool oven some slices of stale bread; they must be thoroughly dried and lightly crisped. Crush them with a rolling-pin, and pass through a fine wire sieve. Put into a perfectly dry bottle and store for use.30 MEAT. General Rules for cooking Meat.—The most important point to be considered in cooking meat is to cook it in such a way that it may retain all its nourishing properties. To do this the meat must be subjected to rather fierce heat for a few minutes to contract the pores of the surface of the meat; but, that being done, the temperature must immediately be lowered, in boiling by adding cold water to the boiling water, and in roasting by drawing the joint further from the fire, and then the more slowly the meat is cooked the more tender it will taste. See directions for boiling, roasting, etc. To Roast Joints, etc.—To roast a joint properly the cook must devote a good deal of attention to it. It is best to put the screen on which the joint is hung close to a clear bright fire for twenty minutes, and then draw it back a little, so that the rest of the cooking can be done quite slowly. A little dripping should be put into the pan to baste the meat with till there is sufficient of its own fat to use, and it must be basted continually all the time it is •cooking. About twenty minutes is the proper time to allow for every pound of meat, but this will vary with the seasons ; in the hot weather a little shorter time will be sufficient. To Bake Joints.—With the kitchen ranges now in vogue it is much more usual to bake meat than to roast it. For this pur- pose a very ingenious baking tin is sold, which cooks the meat without any attention on the part of the cook ; and as full instruc- tions about how to use it are sold with the baking tin, there is no need to repeat them here. To bake meat without the help of this new invention it is usual to have a hot-water tin on which the meat-stand is placed. In a corner of the tray there is a hole for the steam to escape. There must be enough water to come nearly up to the hole. The meat must be put on a stand, whether there is a hot-water tin or not, to keep it from getting sodden by the dripping. The oven must be made quite hot; if youMEAT. 3' have a thermometer it should stand at 240° Fahr. Put the meat on the stand after it has been trimmed and skewered and bound into a good shape, and dredged with flour and pepper; let the fat side be uppermost. Keep the ventilator of the oven closed for five minutes till the surface of the meat is hardened to keep in the juices, but then it must be opened or the meat will be spoilt. Baste the meat well every quarter of an hour. Allow twenty minutes to every pound of meat. When the meat is half cooked it can be turned over if it is a very thick joint. Half an hour before the joint is ready to take up sprinkle a little salt and flour over it and baste it well. After this it should not be basted again before it is served, or it will taste greasy. For the gravy pour off the dripping and put about half a pint of boiling water into the tin, stirring and scraping those parts which have become hard and dry, dredge in a very little flour and salt, and put the tin on the range to boil, then strain it and pour it into the dish. Cold Meat Cookery.—I have only given a few recipes for using up cold meat, and they are all good if the seasoning is properly attended to, and the gravy and other details are daintily prepared, but all depends upon these. The meat should never be really cooked again, only thoroughly warmed through. It is good housekeeping to have joints that are just the right size for your household, so that there should be as little as possible left to cook up. It is better to make dainty salads and sometimes serve a joint cold than have it cooked up. Curry and beef olives and many other dishes are more nourish- ing and much more tasty made of fresh meat than cooked meat, and it is often possible to cut something off the joint before it is roasted that can be used to make a second dinner. Some people dislike cold meat, and prefer delicate cooked-up trifles, and when they do the utmost care must be taken in the prepara- tion of them, that they may be good to look at as well as agreeable to the taste. To Boil Meat.—It has already been explained that when the32 MEAT. nourishment is to be extracted from meat for soups, gravies, etc., the meat must be put into cold water ; but when the juices of the meat are to be retained, as they must be for joints that are to be sent to table, the meat must first be plunged into fast boiling water for a few minutes. Then as much cold water must be added as will reduce the whole to a moderate temperature. Part of the water should then be taken away, as meat should never be cooked in a larger quantity than is necessary to keep it entirely covered until it is ready to serve; for this reason it should always be boiled in a vessel nearly of its own size. Large joints should be neatly trimmed, skewered and bound firmly into good shape when they are of a nature to require it, brought to boil over a moderate fire, and simmered until they are done, the scum being cleared from the surface of the water as it rises. Pickled or salt meat requires longer boiling than the fresh, and that which is smoked and dried longer still. This last should be laid into cold water and slowly heated. The time allowed for boiling meat is about the same as for roasting, from twenty to twenty-five minutes for a pound. Beef a-la-mode.—2 lbs. rumpsteak (two inches thick), a few thin slices of fat bacon, 1 calfs foot or part of a cow’s heel, 2 tablespoons of brandy, one carrot, one onion, pepper and salt, | pint water. Lay the slices of bacon on the beefsteak and put it into an earthenware stew-pot, lay at the side the calf’s foot or cow’s heel, a few sweet herbs, one small carrot cut into little pieces, one onion cut in slices, the brandy, water, pepper and salt. Put the lid on the jar and place in a moderate oven. Stew for three hours or more, turning the jar round occasionally. When done skim off the fat and take away the bacon and calfs foot. Serve with the gravy and vegetables round. Beef Olives (fresh meat).—ii lbs. rumpsteak, 1 egg, 1 table- spoon minced parsley and lemon thyme, or a thin layer of force- meat, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of stock, two or three slices of bacon, 2 tablespoons of port wine, thickening of butter and33 MEAT. flour. Divide the steak into thin slices, about four inches long and three wide; brush over with egg; spread with a layer of veal forcemeat; roll up the pieces tightly and fasten with a small skewer. Put the stock in a stew-pan that will only just hold the olives; lay in the rolls of meat, cover them with the bacon, which remove before serving. Stew them very gently for two hours. Take them out, remove the skewers, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and flavour with two tablespoons of port wine. Give one boil, pour over the meat, and serve very hot. Beef Olives (of cooked meat).—The remains of cold beef, forcemeat, thickening of flour and butter, mushroom ketchup. Cut some slices of beef rather thick; spread a little forcemeat on one side of each piece and roll it up tightly and secure with narrow tape. Have ready some gravy in a small stew-pan, put in the olives and stew gently about one and a half hours. Arrange the olives on a hot dish after cutting off the tape, and thicken the gravy with a little flour and butter and flavour with pepper and salt, and mushroom ketchup or wine. Pour round the olives and serve. Beef Cheek Pie.—Stew a beef cheek very tender, take out the bones, tie up the meat in a cloth, put a weight upon it, and let it stand till the next day; then make some forcemeat as for veal. Boil eight eggs hard, cut the cheek in slices, put one at the bottom of the dish, then a layer of forcemeat, another of egg, and so on till the dish is full. Then put in as much gravy as the dish will hold. Put on a puff paste and bake. Beefsteak Pie.—2 lbs. beefsteak and lb. beef kidney. Mix 1 tablespoon flour and 2 teaspoons of pepper and the same of salt on a plate. Cut the beefsteak into thin strips, dip each piece into the mixture and roll, set on edge in the pie- dish and pack to the top with layers of kidney between, and, if liked, hard-boiled egg. Fill half full with water and cover with pastry; make a hole at the top to let out the steam. Brush over 334 MEAT. with yolk of egg and bake two and a half hours, at first briskly and then slowly, with greased paper over the top. Beefsteak Pudding.—i| lbs. beefsteak and i 11). beef kidney. Cut the meat into rather thin small pieces, dip each into a mixture made of i tablespoon flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Make some suet crust and line the sides only of a buttered pie-dish, fill with the meat, pour in some cold water, cover with some more suet crust. Tie up in a scalded and floured cloth and plunge into boiling water. Boil for about four hours and serve in the dish. This is much the nicest way of making this pudding. Collared Beef.—Mix 4 oz. of saltpetre with the same quantity of pepper, 4 oz. of bay salt, and 4 oz. of common salt; with these rub well from 6 to 7 lbs. of the thin flank, and in four days add 7 oz. of treacle ; turn the beef daily in the pickle for a week or ten days; then dip it into water to take off the pickle, bone it and skin the inside, roll and bind it up very tightly, lay it into cold water and simmer for three hours and a half. Beef dressed in this way is extremely good. The beef should be put between two dishes whilst it is hot, and a heavy weight placed on the top. Glaze it when cold. Croquettes of Beef.—£ lb. lean cooked beef, 1 onion, 1 oz. butter, a little flour, £ pint of stock, 2 eggs, bread-crumbs, pepper and salt. Mince the beef finely, cut off all outside pieces, chop up the onion and fry it in a stew-pan with the butter till quite brown, then pour in the stock (if you have no stock use Lemco mixed with water) and a very little flour ; let it boil for a few minutes; season the minced beef with pepper and salt and put it with the gravy in the stew-pan, then stir in quickly for two minutes the well-beaten yolk of one egg and pour it upon a dish to cool. When cold make the mince into balls, roll them in very fine bread-crumbs, then in the yolk of an egg, and then in bread- crumbs again. Fry them in a frying basket a light brown, and serve piled up on a dish with fried parsley for a garnish.MEAT. 35 To Stew Rumpsteak.—2 oz. butter, if lbs. rumpsteak, 1 dozen oysters, 1 tablespoon flour, 4 pickled walnuts, 1 pint water, 1 onion. Cut up the steak into nice little pieces and fry in the butter until they are brown on both sides. Then in the same butter fry the onion chopped up and the pickled walnuts also cut into little bits. Put all into a saucepan with a pint of water and simmer gently for three hours, skim well and add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, 1 tablespoon of sherry, and thicken the liquor with the flour. Let it boil for a few minutes, and then take off" the fire and leave till it gets cold. Skim off the fat, and the following day warm up the steak and gravy and add the oysters with some of their liquor strained. To Pickle Beef.—-f teaspoon powdered mace, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon cloves, f small nutmeg, a pinch of cayenne, 3I oz. brown sugar. Mix these ingredients together, and well rub 6 lbs. of flank or silver-side of beef with them, and let it lie three days. Then add f lb. fine salt, and rub and turn it over once in twenty-four hours for twelve days. To Roast Sirloin or Ribs of Beef.—Trim the joint and tie and skewer it into a good shape. Dredge it with flour and hang it on the spit. Place it near the fire for a few minutes, then draw it to a distance and let it remain so until the heat has penetrated through it; baste continually, first with a little dripping, after- wards with its own fat; let it be drawn nearer to the fire for the last half-hour or more of roasting, to brown it well. From twenty to thirty minutes a pound is required to cook joints. For the gravy empty the dripping-pan of all the dripping, pour in some boiling water slightly salted, stir it about and strain over the meat. A simpler plan is to bake the meat in one of the new “ household ” self-basting baking-pans. They answer well, and are no trouble at all. Sirloin of Beef. —A sirloin of beef can be divided by cutting out the undercut and cooking it in one of the different ways for which recipes are given. The thick part of the meat can be re-36 MEAT. moved from the bones with a sharp knife, then rolled and roasted. A small quantity of meat should be left on the bones, which can be grilled for luncheon or breakfast. To Roast Rolled Ribs of Beef.—One or two ribs. Bone the meat and roll the meat round, secure it with wooden skewers, and bind it with tape. Roast like a sirloin. When cooked remove the skewers and put a silver one in place of them, and cut off the tape. If you use the new “household ” self-basting baking- pan, and read the directions for using it, this will be a still simpler way of cooking this joint. To Roast a Fillet of Beef.—Lard the fillet through with fat bacon, baste it with butter, and send it very hot to table with brown gravy and forcemeat balls. Serve red currant jelly or a piquant sauce with it. To Broil Beefsteaks.—The steaks should be from half to three quarters of an inch thick, equally sliced and freshly cut from the middle of a well-kept, tender rump of beef. The fire must be strong and clear. The bars of the gridiron should be thin and not very close together. When they are thoroughly heated, without being sufficiently burning to scorch the meat, wipe and rub them with fresh mutton suet ; next pepper the steaks slightly, but never season them with salt before they are dressed; lay them on the gridiron, and when done on one side turn them on the other, being careful to catch, in the dish in which they are to be sent to table, any gravy which may drain from them. Ten to fifteen minutes is sufficient to broil steaks. Let them be served at once on a very hot dish. To Fry Beefsteaks.—Put some butter into a frying-pan, let it get quite hot, and if you are going to use onions slice them and fry them in the butter. Then put in the beefsteak and turn it frequently until it is done, which ought to be in about ten to fifteen minutes. Should the beefsteak be rather fresh it is well to beat it before it is cooked, and fry it an hour and a half before it is wanted, and then put a plate over the frying-pan and draw it37 MEAT. away from the hottest part of the stove and let it stew slowly till it is wanted. This ought never to be necessary for rumpsteak, but in the country it is not always possible to get this, and ordi- nary beefsteak is very tender cooked in this way. To make more gravy pour a little boiling water, pepper, salt, and Harvey or ketchup sauce into the frying-pan after the meat is taken out. Scotch Collops.—11 lbs. lean beefsteak, i onion, i oz. butter, a little flour, ^ pint of stock, pepper and salt. Mince the beef finely with a knife, cut off all the fat and skinny portions; chop up the onion and fry it in the butter till brown, then pour in the stock and dredge in a very little flour; let it boil for a few minutes. Season the minced beef with pepper and salt, and add it to the gravy in the stew-pan. Simmer it very gently from ten to twelve minutes, stirring with a fork all the time that it may not get lumpy. Add a little more boiling stock if it is too dry. Serve on a hot dish, and garnish with crofttons. To Stew Beefsteak.—Fry the meat in I oz. of butter in the stew-pan, dredge in a little flour, and when it is brown pour in by degrees enough hot water to cover the meat. When it comes to boiling-point draw the pan a little back, take off the scum, add salt, a sliced onion, carrot, a stick of celery, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a dozen peppercorns. Simmer gently for three hours. A quarter of an hour before it is served mix in three teaspoons of arrowroot smoothly mixed with half a wine- glass of mushroom ketchup, a pinch of mace and cayenne. This will flavour and thicken the gravy. Button mushrooms are a great improvement, and if they are used they will take twenty minutes to stew in the gravy. To Stew Steak and Macaroni.—11 lbs. steak, | lb. maca- roni. Cut the beef in small pieces, roll them in flour, and fry slightly in 2 oz. of butter; put the meat into a stew-pan, just cover with hot water, and allow it to simmer for one and a half hours; then add the macaroni, and simmer again for three quarters of an hour.38 MEAT. Season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and stew for ten minutes more. Serve on a very hot dish, the beef in the centre and the macaroni round, and garnish with gherkins, chillies, or pickled walnut. To Fry Fillets of Beef (i) (very good).—Undercut of beef, 2 oz. butter. Pepper, salt, parsley, flour, mustard, tomato sauce. Mix a teaspoon of pepper and the same of salt, i tablespoon each of chopped parsley and flour (more if there is much beef) on a plate. Cut the beef into small slices and cover with made mus- tard. Dip each piece into the plate, first one side and then the other, till it is well sprinkled with the ingredients. Fry in butter. Arrange on a very hot dish in a ring, the slices overlapping one another, and pour round hot tomato sauce. To Fry Fillets of Beef (2) .—Undercut of sirloin of beef, 1 lemon, 2 oz. butter, gravy. Cut the undercut into small slices; fry them for eight minutes in two ounces of butter. Warm some good gravy and add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, seasoning it to your taste. Put a mould of mashed potatoes in the centre of a very hot dish. Stand the fillets or slices of beef round it, leaning them against the side of the potatoes. Pour the gravy round and serve. Fillets of Beef with Mushrooms.— 1 lb. button mush- rooms, undercut of beef. Proceed as in preceding recipe, but make a sauce of 1 oz. of butter and 1 oz. of flour melted in a saucepan and smoothly mixed, add a little stock and the mush- rooms and a little lemon juice. Cook till the mushrooms are tender, and heap them on the dish instead of potatoes, lay the fillets in the dish and pour the sauce round. Serve very hot. Spiced Beef (pressed).—From 6 to 8 lbs. of the round, rump, or thick flank of beef; | teaspoon each of pepper, mace, nutmeg, and mustard, all in powder; 1 teaspoon of ground cloves and a little cayenne; 4 oz. brown sugar; 4 oz. salt. Mix all these in- gredients thoroughly together and rub the beef well with the mixture, taking care that every part of the joint is rubbed. Leave39 MEAT. the joint in an earthenware pan with the mixture and turn it once in twenty-four hours. In twelve days the beef will be ready. It must then be washed but not left to soak, tie and skewer the joint into a good shape and put it into a stew-pan which is only just big enough to take it, and pour over it rather less than two pints of boiling water, a small onion, a carrot, a sprig of thyme and parsley, a bay-leaf, and a little bit of celery. Let it simmer slowly for three hours and skim occasionally, then take out the beef and put it in a deep dish. Press it, and when cold glaze it. To Salt Beef.—Take a piece of silver-side of the round weighing about 7 or 8 lbs. and cover it with brown sugar well rubbed in, and allow it to remain six hours; then powder half an ounce of saltpetre and press this equally on all sides to give it a colour; next cover it with common salt and let it stay till next day. Turn it and rub with the salt in the pan for five or six days, throwing the brine over it at the same time with a spoon. If salted in this way the meat will not become hard. Bubble-and-Squeak.—Boil some cabbage, drain it and press it, and cut small. Cut some thin slices of cold boiled beef, lean and fat together; fry gently in butter or dripping till they are hot through, and put them on a very hot dish. Then put the cabbage into the frying-pan to get thoroughly hot, and serve on the dish with the meat arranged round it. Potato Pie.—Cold meat minced, potato. To every pound of minced meat allow a quarter of a pound of mashed potatoes and a little minced parsley. Mix well, and put into a pie-dish with some gravy, a tablespoon of ketchup or Worcester sauce, a good seasoning of pepper and salt, and cover with mashed potatoes. Bake for an hour. Another way.—Cut the cold meat into slices and put alternate layers of meat and mashed potatoes or sliced tomatoes, and seasoning as before and gravy. Cover with mashed potato and bake. Crumb Pie.—Proceed as for potato pie, but use bread-crumbs instead of potatoes, and put little bits of butter on the top.M HAT. 40 Curry. — Any meat will do, but raw meat is the best. In the latter case cut up i lb. rumpsteak into pieces the size of dice, and fry them in 2 oz. butter till the meat is nicely coloured and about half cooked. Now fry 2 or 3 moderate-sized onions and an apple finely sliced, till they are a rich red-brown colour, add to them, in the same pan, 2 tablespoons of curry powder and a little dust of cayenne and salt ; let this fry also ; then pour on to it a little boiling water or stock, about a third of a pint. Add the meat and stew gently till the sauce is thick and the meat tender. When using cooked meat it is unnecessary to fry the meat the first time, but otherwise proceed as in the recipe for raw meat. Serve with a dish of rice. Dry Curry.—Fry a minced onion in butter until lightly browned. Cut into pieces the size of dice, | lb. of cooked chicken, rabbit, or any white meat; mix this with the onion and stir them together over the fire until the meat is hot quite through: sprinkle over it 1 tablespoon of curry powder and salt to taste. Thoroughly mix the meat with the curry powder, pour over it 1 tablespoon of cream or milk, and stir over the fire till the moisture has dried. Serve with a dish of rice. To Boil Rice for Curry.—Wash as much Patna rice as is required in several waters, and leave it to soak a little. Then throw it into a large saucepan of very fast boiling water with a little salt, and keep it boiling twenty minutes, or less time if it is soft: The rice should be drained in a colander, and cold water poured over it. Dry the saucepan, put the rice back into it with the lid half off, and set it on the side of the range to get hot and dry. Shake occasionally to separate the grains; take care the rice does not get hard. Gravy for Joints.—After the joint is cooked strain the dripping into a basin, then put some boiling water in the dripping-pan with 1 teaspoon brown flour and pepper and salt, stir it about, and set it on the stove till it is quite boiling, then strain it over the meat.41 MI*: AT. To Hash Meat.—Put into a saucepan one or two sliced onions and fry in a little butter. Then add half a pint of stock and flavour with pepper, salt, and mushroom ketchup. Thicken with a teaspoon or more of flour. If there is no stock, make some with the bones and trimmings of the meat, f of a pint of water, and i a teaspoon of Lemco. Then lay in the cold meat cut into neat thin slices, and warm through. If it boils the meat is spoilt. Put the meat into a hot dish and pour the gravy over Garnish with pickled walnuts and sippets of toast. It makes a variety to boil some macaroni separately and put a border of that round the hash. To Boil a Ham.—Well soak the ham in a large quantity of cold water for twelve hours, and change the water twice, then scrape it clean, put it into a large stew-pan with more than sufficient cold water to cover it, put in a blade of mace, a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf. Boil it four or five hours, and when done let it get cold in the liquor in which it was boiled. * Then remove the rind and shake browned bread-crumbs over it. To Cure Hams (very good).—Sufficient ingredients for two hams, about 16 lbs. each in weight : if lbs. of bay salt, if lbs. treacle, 5 oz. saltpetre, 3 oz. white pepper. Baste with the liquor once every day. Rub the hams with the dry ingredients thoroughly well the first day : the next day add the treacle and baste with the liquor ; leave one month in pickle, never omitting the basting once a day. When taken out of the pickle and drained, brush them all over with “ Smith’s Cambrian Essence,” and hang up in a dry place. The hams should be kept at least a year before they are used. They can be used sooner, but are not so good as when the)' are riper. Hot Pot.—2 lbs. beefsteak, or best end of neck of mutton, or two small rabbits, potatoes. For this a covered pie-dish or jar, that can be sent to table, is needed. Cut up the rabbit into joints and the meat into small pieces, flavour highly with pepperMEAT. 42 and salt, just cover the meat with hot water. Have ready some potatoes, peeled and cut in half lengthways, put a layer of these on the top and put a little bit of butter on them, sprinkle with salt. Put on the lid of the dish and bake in an oven an hour and a half or longer. Take the cover off a short time before sending to table to brown the top layer of potatoes. This is a useful supper dish. Cooked meat could be used, but is not nearly so nice. Meat Patties.—£ lb. minced meat (cooked meat), 4 oz. minced ham, 1 gill cream, r oz. butter, 1 oz. flour, 1 gill stock. Melt the butter in the stew-pan and stir in very smoothly the flour, and afterwards the stock. When the sauce is thick add a little cream and season rather highly with cayenne and salt, mace, and a teaspoon of ketchup. Add the mince, stir well, together for one minute, and take off the fire at once. Turn out the mixture on to a plate to get cold, and cover over with another plate. Make some pastry and line some patty-pans with it, put in a tablespoon of meat, cover with pastry, moistening the edges with water to make them stick. Brush the patties over with yolk of egg, make a hole in the centre, and bake. Breast of Lamb and Mushrooms.—Cut out the bones from the lamb, melt a little butter in a stew-pan, put in the meat and turn it about till it is equally browned all over, sprinkle with pepper, salt, and a teaspoon of chopped parsley, and the mush- rooms. Just cover the meat with water or stock and simmer very gently for an hour. Ten minutes before the meat is taken up add a few drops of lemon juice to the gravy. Put the lamb on a hot dish, place the mushrooms round it, and strain the gravy over it. The gravy should be thickened with a little flour and butter, and flavoured with white wine. To Stew a Breast of Lamb with Peas.—Breast of lamb, pepper and salt to taste, sufficient stock to cover it, thickening of flour and butter, i£ pints green peas. Skin the lamb and cut into pieces, and season with pepper and salt; lay these in a stew-pan43 MEAT. with sufficient stock or gravy to cover them and | pint of peas, and stew gently for an hour and a half. Just before serving thicken the gravy with a little flour, give one boil and pour it over the meat. Have ready the rest of the peas boiled, and put with the gravy over the meat. Stewed mushrooms are also an addition to this dish, or they can be used instead of the peas. Lamb Cutlets.—Cut and trim 8 cutlets from the best end of the neck, flatten them, brush over with beaten egg, and dip them into a mixture of fine bread-crumbs, minced parsley, pepper and salt. Fry them a golden brown in boiling fat. Put them before the fire on a sieve to drain. Have ready a puree of spinach in an entree dish, and place the cutlets neatly round it. Serve with brown sauce. Brown Sauce.—Mix 4 oz. butter and 4 oz. of browned flour in a small saucepan. When quite smooth and hot add 1 a pint of good stock well seasoned. Serve in a sauce- boat. Lamb’s Fry.—Partly boil the sweetbreads; throw them into cold water, and wrhen cold trim them. Flour all the pieces and fry in the frying-pan in some bacon fat. When nicely browned pour a little water into the frying-pan and thicken with a little brown flour. Throw in some chopped parsley and season with pepper and salt. Serve fried bacon with this dish. Lamb (to Roast a Fore-quarter).—Roast in the usual way accord- ing to directions given. The meat must be thoroughly cooked. Mint sauce should be served with it. A cut lemon, a small piece of butter, and a little cayenne should be placed on the table, so that when the shoulder is cut off they can be put between the shoulder and breast. To Roast a Breast of Mutton.—4 or 5 lbs. breast of mutton. Boil gently for an hour, take out of the saucepan and remove the bones and skin with a sharp knife. Sprinkle with pepper and bread-crumbs on the outside, roll into shape and skewer firmly, place a few small pieces of dripping on the meat. Put the meat in a brisk oven and bake for f of an hour. The bones needM EAT. 44 not be removed, but the meat should always be sprinkled with pepper and bread-crumbs before being put in the oven. Fillets of Mutton (entree).—Take out the fillet from a loin of mutton and pare away the fat. Cut it into little slices and lard each one. Cut into small pieces a carrot, onion, and small piece of turnip, lay them in a dripping-pan with a very little water. Place the fillets on the top, cover them with buttered paper, and cook in a brisk oven for twenty minutes; when they are cooked glaze them over and dish on a ring of mashed potatoes. In the centre of the ring pile up green peas or French beans. Pour some good brown sauce round the dish. Fillet of Mutton Roasted.—Cut out the bone, and fill in with forcemeat (made the same way as for veal). Tie the fillet round with tape, sprinkle the meat with pepper and flour, and roast in the ordinary way. When it is done cut off the tape and put in a silver skewer. Red currant jelly can be served with this joint. Haricot Mutton.—-3 lbs. best end neck of mutton, 3 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 onions, ketchup, salt, pepper, butter. Cut off some of the fat and divide the chops. Fry them lightly in 2 oz. butter till half cooked, cut the onions in slices and the carrots and turnips into fancy pieces, and fry them in the same butter in which the chops were done, but not enough to change their colour. Then put the mutton in the stew-pan with the vegetables on it and just cover with hot water, allow it to come to boiling- point, and then at once draw' it to the side of the fire to simmer till the chops are tender; season with pepper and salt and two- dessert-spoons mushroom ketchup. Set it to cool and take off the fat, then put it on the fire again to get hot, thicken the gravy with a little brown flour; serve very hot. Keep the stew-pan covered. Irish Stew.—The middle part of a neck of mutton, onions, potatoes. Cut the meat in chops and take off some of the fat. Put a layer of potatoes, peeled and sliced thickly, at the bottomMEAT. 45 of a stew-pan, then a layer of sliced onions, and then the meat, then pepper and salt, then the potatoes, etc., again till the stew- pan is full, taking care that the top layer is potatoes. Fill up with hot water and put on the lid. Stew very slowly, never letting it even nearly boil, for two or three hours. When it is done take out enough potatoes to lay round the dish, lay in the meat, and then mash roughly with a fork the rest of the potatoes in the gravy, so that it is quite thick, and pour over the meat. Leg of Mutton.—For a small household it is best not to cook the whole joint at once. It will make three separate hot dishes. Divide the leg, making the knuckle end the lesser half. Cut steaks off the fillet, but from the knuckle end of the fillet, as these are tenderer than the ones from the top end. The steaks can be fried or stewed according to the various recipes given, and will make one dish. The fillet, boned, stuffed, and roasted will make another. And the knuckle can either be boiled served with parsley or caper sauce or made into Scotch broth. To Boil Leg of Mutton. —Take the knuckle end of the leg and boil according to directions, in hot water. Add to it a few carrots and turnips cut into strips or fancy shapes, and two table- spoons of pearl barley or rice. When the mutton is cooked dish it up and pour over it some parsley or caper sauce, made with a little of the broth. Put the vegetables and rice in little heaps round the dish. Serve mashed turnips separately. To Boil a Knuckle of Mutton (Scotch Broth).—Another way of using the knuckle end of a leg of mutton is to cut it up into small pieces, put the meat into a saucepan with some cold water, some carrots and turnips and a parsnip cut up small, a cup of washed rice or pearl barley, and two onions. Bring to a boil and then leave it to simmer till tender. Put a little chopped parsley and pepper and salt in the saucepan about half an hour before it is ready. Serve in a soup tureen. Scotch Broth.—This is usually made of the scrag end of theMEAT. 46 neck of mutton, but is in every other respect like the preceding recipe. To Roast a Leg of Mutton.—Time, 20 minutes to the pound. A leg of mutton is better for roasting after it has been hung as long as the weather will allow. It must be wiped very dry and dusted with flour and pepper. Cut off the knuckle, and trim off the piece of flank. Roast in the ordinary way according to the directions already given for roasting or baking meat. To Roast Loin of Mutton.—Cut off some of the fat and dredge with flour and pepper. Roast in the usual way. Serve red currant jelly with it. Loin of Mutton.—If a loin of mutton is carved like a saddle of mutton, the part from where the slices have been cut can be filled with mashed potatoes, and re-warmed for luncheon in the patent baking tin. Loin of Mutton boned and stuffed.—Skin and bone it. Make a good forcemeat, the same as veal stuffing. Lay it out flat and season with pepper and salt and the forcemeat. Roll the loin into a tight compact shape and bind with tape. Roast in the usual way. Serve red currant jelly in a separate dish. Mince (1).—Fry an onion in a little piece of butter in a sauce- pan, take out the onion and add about a quarter of a pint of good stock, flavour with Harvey sauce, pepper and salt, and add a very little flour to thicken it. Lay in the meat minced very finely with a knife, not in a machine, and warm through. Serve with sippets of toast round, and if liked, poached eggs on the mince. Mince (2) (another way).—Chop the meat finely. Put it in a saucepan with a very little gravy, only just enough to moisten the meat, a little ketchup and pepper and salt. Just make hot and serve. Everything depends on the flavouring. A little grated lemon rind is an improvement to mince made of white meat. Mince Moulds.—6 oz. cooked beef or mutton, 2 oz. ham, 1 teaspoon minced parsley, 4 oz. bread-crumbs, 2 eggs, 1 oz. butter, pepper and salt. Free the meat from skin and gristle, and47 MEAT. mince it very.finely. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly together, and moisten with two beaten eggs. Butter some little moulds and fill with the mixture; bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, and insert a small sprig of parsley in the top of each when it is turned out of the mould. Pour brown gravy round them. Mince Cutlets.—? lb. minced cooked meat, I oz. minced ham, 3 or 4 tablespoons bread-crumbs, i oz. butter, i pint stock, i egg, i oz. flour, pepper, salt, and cayenne, i dessert-spoon hot sauce. Put the butter and flour into a saucepan and mix into a smooth paste. Add the stock, seasoning, and hot sauce, and let it boil, stirring all the time, pour it into a basin, add the bread- crumbs and minced meat, and mix well. Spread the mixture on a plate firmly and evenly, and put it aside to get cold and firm. With a floured knife cut the mixture on the plate into triangular- shaped pieces, starting from the centre of the plate. Flour a board and shape each piece like a cutlet, put 2 inches of straight macaroni into the narrow end of each cutlet to represent bone. Egg and bread-crumb and fry in very hot fat. Serve with a little brown gravy. Mutton Chops.—These are always best grilled. They should be cut from a loin, be about three quarters of an inch thick, and have about half an inch of fat left round them. They will take about ten minutes to cook. They should be turned four times (but on no account must a fork be stuck into them) and sprinkled with pepper and salt and a little piece of butter put on them. The chief point in broiling is to attend to the fire. Half an hour before you want to cook your chops stir up your fire and clear away the ashes, stir all dead cinders from the bottom, and by the time you are ready to cook the fire will be clear and bright. Mutton Chops and Green Peas.—ij lbs. best end neck of mutton, and 1 pint shelled peas. Trim the chops carefully, making them a good shape, and cutting away most of the fat, dredge them well with flour and lay them in a stew-pan with a sprig of mint and a very small onion, and just cover them withM EAT. 48 cold water. Bring them slowly to boiling-point, but do not allow them quite to boil or the meat will be very hard. Then draw back the stew-pan from the fire and add the peas. Season with salt and pepper and a dust of cayenne. Simmer gently for half an hour, or longer if the peas are not soft. Dish up the chops and put the peas in the centre of the dish and pour the gravy round. Mutton Cutlets (i).—2 lbs. best end neck of mutton. Take off the cutlets, shape them and chop off the thick part of the chine bone, beat them flat with a chopper, cut off all the fat. Season with pepper and salt. Egg and bread-crumb, and fry in lard. Place them on paper in front of the fire to drain off the fat. Serve with a puree of tomatoes or potato, etc. Mutton Cutlets (2).—2 lbs. loin chops, parsley, thyme, 2 eggs, bread-crumbs, 2 oz. butter, 1 lemon, cayenne and salt. Trim the cutlets and lay in a stew-pan with the butter which has been melted, season them and let them stew for a short time, but without getting any colour. Mince the thyme and parsley, and bind with the yolk of an egg. When the cutlets are nearly cold spread the minced herbs over them, sprinkle with bread-crumbs and cayenne, broil them on a gridiron, and when they are brown squeeze lemon juice over them. Mutton Cutlets a la Rdforme (an entree).—From 1 carrot, 1 turnip, the hard-boiled white of 1 egg, 2 slices of lean ham, 2 green gherkins, 9 French beans, cut out narrow strips of about two inches in length, also a few star- and diamond-shaped pieces. Partly boil the carrot and turnip before cutting into shapes. Make a sauce of 1 oz. of butter browned with 1 oz. of flour, add f pint of good stock, 1 shred onion, 1 tablespoon spiced vinegar, 1 dessert-spoon red currant jelly, 6 cloves, stir and let it boil for five minutes, then strain it through a fine gravy strainer, return the sauce to the pan, and add a few of the cut vegetables, white of egg, pickles, ham, a dust of cayenne, 1 tablespoon sherry wine, and let it just boil up. Have seven cutlets readyM EAT. 49 that have been dipped into the beaten yolks of two eggs, and then into a mixture of minced ham, bread-crumbs, pepper and salt; fry the cutlets in boiling fat for five minutes. Arrange the cutlets in a ring in an entree dish, pour the sauce in the centre, and garnish with the remainder of the vegetables, ham and eggs. To Boil Neck of Mutton with Parsley Sauce.—Cut off some of the fat and trim the joint to a good shape, sawing off a bit of the end of the bones to make the joint more compact. Put it into a saucepan with a few carrots and turnips and enough water to cover it, and some salt. Boil slowly, allowing twenty minutes to the pound. Rice or pearl barley may be added if liked, and served with the meat and vegetables round the dish, and parsley or caper sauce should be poured over the meat. To Roast Neck of Mutton.—This is rather a fat, rich joint roasted, but if it is liked it must be trimmed into shape and a great deal of the fat taken off and the ends of the bones sawn off. It should then be roasted in the usual way, allowing twenty minutes to the pound. Saddle of Mutton.—Time, twenty minutes to the pound. Take off the skin, cover the fat with a sheet of wTell-greased paper, and roast it according to directions already given for roasting or baking meat. A few minutes before the joint is cooked remove the paper, sprinkle salt over it and dredge with flour, and drop warmed butter over it. Make the gravy in the usual way and serve red currant jelly in a separate dish. Roast Shoulder of Mutton.—Twenty minutes to the pound. Flour it well and sprinkle with pepper. Roast in the usual way. Serve onion sauce with it. Pickle for Beef, Pork, or Tongue.—i lb. coarse sugar, £ lb. bay salt, i lb. saltpetre, and 2 lbs. common salt. Boil these ingredients in 2 gallons of water, take off the scum as it rises, and then let the liquor stand till cold and put in your meat. Turn it every day, and a tongue or moderate joint will be ready in a fortnight. 4MEAT. 50 Pork Chops.—These are best fried in a frying-pan in their own fat. They take about twenty minutes, or twice as long as mutton chops to cook, and must be thoroughly done. Season with pepper and salt. Either tomato sauce, apple sauce, or piquante sauce may be served with them in addition to some brown gravy. Leg of Pork.—Roast in the usual way according to direc- tions given. Score the skin across in narrow strips, rub a little salad oil on the skin with a brush or feather; this will make it very crisp and brown, and prevent the skin from blistering. When done, sprinkle with chopped sage, and serve with sage and onion stuffing-balls round the dish and apple sauce in a tureen. Loin of Pork.—The same as leg of pork. To Boil Pickled Pork.—If the pork is very salt let it soak in cold water for a few hours. Then put it in a saucepan and cover with cold water and bring it slowly to the boil. Skim the liquid, draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let the meat simmer gently till it is done ; as a rule, it takes half an hour to the pound from the time the water boils. Rissoles (i).—Mince finely any sort of cold meat, and be most careful to free it from every bit of skin, gristle, or outside pieces. Add a thin slice of fat ham or bacon minced with the meat. To four tablespoons of minced meat allow one tablespoon of grated bread-crumbs, one tablespoon cooked potato, one tea- spoon chopped parsley, half a teaspoon thyme, a little chopped lemon rind, salt and pepper. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly with the meat and bind together with an egg, roll into balls, dip in egg and bread-crumbs, and fry in very hot fat. Rissoles (2).—Take 1 lb. of beef or mutton, mince twice through a machine. Mix the meat together with | lb. mashed potatoes, 1 teaspoon of finely chopped parsley, pepper and salt to taste, moisten with 3 tablespoons of stock or gravy, and 1 egg well beaten. Make the mixture into balls, cover with egg and bread-crumbs. Fry a nice brown and serve. To Boil a Tongue.—The tongue should be fresh from the5 1 MEAT. pickle. Wash it well from the salt and trim off any unsightly parts. Put it in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Let it come very slowly to a boil, skim off the scum as it rises, and then simmer gently for about four hours. When done remove the skin and fasten the tongue down on a board with a couple of forks and a piece of string into the shape of a high-heeled slipper. When it is cold glaze and ornament it. To Boil a Calf’s Head. —Half a calf’s head, i pint melted butter with parsley, i lemon, pepper and salt. Soak the calf’s head in cold water for one and a half hours, and then for ten minutes in boiling water to blanch it. Remove the tongue and brains. Put the calf’s head into a saucepan with enough cold water for it to swim, and i dessert-spoon of salt, and let it boil gently. When the scum rises, skim well. After the head boils let it simmer gently an hour and a half. The tongue must be boiled with the head, and taken out just before the head is ready; skin and trim it. Take the brains and cut away the skin and fibre, and put them into a stew-pan with enough water to cover them, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Skim carefully, and boil for a quarter of an hour. Just before the head is served chop the brains, put them into a saucepan with half a cup of the melted butter, a tablespoon of chopped parsley, and a few drops of lemon juice, pepper and salt, and bring them to the boil. Put the tongue on a very hot dish, and pour the brains round, and serve at the same time as the calfs head. The head should be dished up, and parsley sauce poured over it and garnished with lemon. Boiled bacon should be served on a separate dish. Calf’s-head Mould.—A good way of using up any remains of a boiled calfs head is to make it into a mould with some aspic jelly. The receipt for this jelly will be found on page 56. Cut the meat off the head into small pieces, and a little ham minced fine is an improvement. Boil two or three eggs hard, dip them in cold water, and cut them in rings. Soak a plain mould in cold water and put a little melted aspic jelly in it and let it set, thenMEAT. 52 arrange the pieces of meat in it and a little chopped parsley and some of the rings of egg. Almost fill the mould, but leave spaces for the jelly to run between the layers of meat and egg. Fill up with jelly, and turn out when quite cold. Calf’s-foot Jelly.—2 calf’s feet, 2 quarts water, whites and shells of 3 eggs. Wash the calf’s feet very thoroughly and cut each one into four pieces, and cut away the fat round the claws. Put them into a stew-pan with rather more than two quarts of cold water and let it boil, then skim well and set it aside to simmer slowly for several hours till the liquid is reduced to one quart. Strain it through a hair sieve and let it get cold. Take off all the fat and put the stock into a stew-pan with the whites and shells of the eggs, stir well till it begins to get hot, then put on the lid of the stew-pan and let it stand on one side of the fire for about ten minutes. Dip your jelly-bag in boiling water and wring it dry, and put your jelly through it once or twice till it is clear. Calf S-head Ragout.—Boil a calf’s head according to direc- tions given. When it is cooked take it up, and cut it into as large slices as possible and about 1 inch thick, and dredge them on both sides with flour, salt, and a very little powdered mace; then fry them in about two ounces of butter till they are lightly browned, and put them in a stew-pan. When the meat is all fried, mix a tablespoon of flour very smoothly with the butter left in the pan, and add gradually half a pint of the liquor in which the head was boiled, and a wineglass of sherry. Season the sauce with a tea- spoon of lemon juice, and a little cayenne and salt. When it is quite smooth pour it over the meat, and let it all simmer together for ten minutes. Put the meat on a dish, and pour the sauce over it. Garnish with the minced brains and tiny rolls of bacon. Calves’ Sweetbreads.—Soak them for an hour and a half in salt and cold water, then boil them ten minutes only, and again throw them into cold water. Trim them, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry in boiling fat in a frying basket.53 MEAT. Sweetbreads Baked and Larded (entree).—Prepare them exactly as in the foregoing recipe, but instead of egg and bread- crumbing them, lard them with bacon and bake them in the oven, and baste with bacon fat. Sprinkle with minced parsley and serve with white sauce. Rolled Breast of Veal. —Bone a breast of veal, lay it flat on a table, and spread over the inside a layer of veal forcemeat (see p. 54), and over that thin slices of ham ; roll the veal very tightly and bind it with tape. Put it into a stew-pan with a plate under it to keep it from sticking, barely cover it with stock or hot water, and simmer gently for about three hours. Put it between two dishes, lay a heavy weight on the top, and let it get cold. This is a good dish for supper, breakfast, or luncheon. To Curry Veal.—i| lbs. veal cutlet, I pint stock, 1 gill cream, | lb. butter, 2 onions, 1 apple, 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon curry powder, 1 tablespoon curry paste, a little salt. Cut the veal into little square pieces. Chop the onion and fry it in the butter, and add the apple chopped finely, and then the curry powder and the paste. Fry these together for five minutes, then add the stock and stir till it boils. When it boils, put in the meat. Simmer gently for two hours, then add the cream and lemon juice. Arrange the meat on a dish with the sauce and serve with boiled rice. Veal Cutlets.—i| lbs. veal cutlet, I egg, bread-crumbs, lemon, butter, parsley, salt and pepper, bacon. Cut the veal into neat little pieces, the size of the top of an egg-cup, and £ inch thick ; brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread-crumbs which have been seasoned with chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Fry them a delicate brown, and be careful not to burn them. They should be thoroughly cooked through, but not dry. Make a gravy in the frying-pan with a piece of butter the size of a walnut and a tea- spoon of flour. When this is brown pour a little boiling water over it, season with pepper and salt and a little lemon juice. Give one boil and pour round the cutlets. A few slices of bacon should be rolled up and cooked on a skewer, and used to garnish the dish.MEAT. 54 To Roast a Fillet of Veal.—Take out the bone and fill the space with forcemeat. Bind the veal into a round and fasten with skewers and tape. Roast in the usual way according to direc- tions, but half an hour before it is done dredge a little flour over it and baste well. The joint should be nicely browned. When done remove the tape and skewers and put in silver ones. Pour £ pint thin melted butter into the dripping-pan instead of water for making the gravy. Garnish with small rolls of broiled bacon. Veal Forcemeat.—The rind of a lemon grated, 2 oz. bread- crumbs, 2 oz. chopped suet, a dessert-spoon chopped parsley, a small teaspoon thyme, pepper and salt, and the yolk of an egg. Fricandeau of Veal.—3! lbs. of the lean part of the best end of neck (boned), y lb. bacon, 3 carrots, y a turnip, 1 onion stuck with 2 cloves, bunch of sweet herbs, 1 bay-leaf, 12 pepper- corns, £ teaspoon grated lemon rind, about 1 pint water. The meat must be nicely trimmed and larded evenly with strips of fat bacon. Roll the meat and bind it with tape, with the larding outside. Cut up the vegetables into small pieces and put them into a stew-pan with some slices of bacon and the trimmings of the meat. Lay the meat on the top of the vegetables, and pour in as much cold water as will cover the vegetables without covering the meat (about one pint). Cover the stew-pan, and let its contents come slowly to the boil, and then stew very gently by the side of the fire till the meat is tender, basting it frequently with its own liquor. It should simmer about two hours. Twenty minutes before it is to be served take the veal out of the stew-pan and put it in a brisk oven to crisp the bacon. Strain the liquor in the stew-pan, skim off the fat, season it, boil quickly to glaze it, and baste the fricandeau with it till it looks glossy. Serve the meat with its own gravy or on a puree of spinach, or some other vegetable. To Boil a Knuckle of Veal.—Wash it and put into a stew- pan, cover with hot water, let it boil and then draw back and simmer gently, and skim frequently for from two to three hoursM EAT. 55 till the flesh will leave the bone. Parsley sauce should be served with it, or plain white sauce ; and bacon also may be served with it, either fried in rolls to garnish the dish, or boiled and served separately. Knuckle of Veal Stewed with Green Peas.—Melt a little butter in a stew-pan and put in two onions sliced and the knuckle. Turn the meat about till it is lightly and evenly browned. Then cover with boiling water, let it boil, and simmer gently for two hours or longer. Put in one pint green peas half an hour before the meat is cooked. Boiled bacon should be served with this dish. Minced Veal.—The remains of cold veal minced by hand, 3 tablespoons cream, x teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel, a pinch of mace, pepper and salt, 1 onion, 1 oz. butter rolled in flour, a little white stock or water. The stock may be made of the bones and trimmings of the meat. When this is made put it in a stew-pan with a little piece of butter rolled in flour to thicken it, add the lemon juice and peel and seasoning and put in the mince, then add a little milk or cream, and just before it boils take it off the fire and serve on a very hot dish garnished with little rolls of fried bacon, sippets of toast, and quarter-slices of lemon. Chicken can be treated in the same way. Stewed Veal and Green Peas.—2 lbs. of the loin, neck, or breast of veal, 2 slices lean bacon, 1 blade mace, 1 bunch savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 onion. Cut the veal into cutlets. Fry in a stew-pan in 2 oz. of butter till lightly browned on both sides. Add the bacon, one small onion stuck with two cloves, spices, herbs, and seasoning ; pour in 1 pint boiling water, and stew gently for two hours. When done skim off the fat and take out the herbs. Have ready 1 quart boiled peas, put a few through a sieve and add to the gravy to thicken it, add pepper and salt, the rest of the peas, and serve. Veal Pie.—About 2 lbs. veal, and a few slices ham or bacon (previously cooked, or it will spoil the colour of the veal). Mix on a plate 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, £ teaspoon56 MEAT. grated lemon rind. Cut the veal into thin strips. Dip each piece into the mixture on the plate and roll up. Set on end in a pie- dish and put some little pieces of ham and bacon in between. Boil four eggs hard, cut into rings and arrange also in the dish. Put a little cold water over the meat, line the edges of the dish with pastry, cover with paste, ornament according to fancy, make a hole for the steam to escape, and bake about two and a half hours. As soon as the crust is risen and set an oiled paper must be laid over it, and the pie put in the coolest part of the oven to cook the meat. Boil the veal bones for two hours in i£ pints slightly salted water, pour off the liquor, skim off the fat, and pour in through a funnel in the hole at the top of the pie just before serving. Rissoles of Veal.—£ lb. cooked veal, i lb. crumb of bread, 2 oz. suet, i pint milk, £ pint gravy, peel of half a lemon, 2 eggs, pepper and salt, mace. Scrape as fine as possible the veal, and salt and mix it with the crumb of bread (previously soaked in the milk), press the milk from the bread before mixing with the other ingredients, season with pepper, salt, mace, and lemon rind grated. Beat up the yolks of the eggs and mix with the mince to moisten it. Roll into balls, cover thickly with bread-crumbs, and fry a golden brown. Serve with gravy. Aspic Jelly.—I oz. gelatine, 1 pint stock, 1 onion, 1 carrot, a bit of celery, 2 cloves, 12 peppercorns, 1 gill sherry, rind and juice of half a lemon, white of 1 egg. The amount of gelatine to be used in making jelly varies a little according to the season ; in winter less is required than in the summer. The gelatine must be soaked in half a pint of cold stock for twenty minutes, and then half a pint of boiling stock should be added, and it must be stirred until all the gelatine is dissolved. When it is cold put it into a saucepan, with the vegetables cut up small, and the lemon juice and spices. Then beat up the white of an egg and add it, and also the shell (crushed). Put the saucepan on the fire, and whisk the mixture till it rises in the saucepan ; stop whisking, put /57 MEAT. the lid on the saucepan and draw it to the side of the fire, add the wine, and let it stand there for rather more than a quarter of an hour. Wring the jelly-bag out in boiling water to make it hot, and pass the jelly through it three or four times. Rinse a mould first in hot and then in cold water, and pour in the jelly and leave till cold. Useful for garnishing and other purposes. Brawn.—A pig’s head, r onion, 2 blades of mace, 4 cloves, 12 peppercorns, 2 bay-leaves, 4 allspice, cayenne, salt. The cheeks of a pig’s head are cured separately, and must be cut out of the pig’s head before it is used for brawn. Cut off the ears. Wash the head and ears and then boil them for an hour and a half, drain off the water and boil them again in cold water until the meat can easily be taken off the bones. It must be skimmed often. Cut the meat off the head and ears into rather small pieces. Put the bones back in the saucepan with one quart stock, vegetables, and seasoning, boil it quickly till it is reduced to one pint, strain it and put it back in the saucepan and add the chopped meat, boil up once more, and then pour it into wet moulds. A hard-boiled egg in the centre of each mould is an improvement. Put a heavy weight on it and let it get cold, and then turn out. Rub the head with salt two days before using. Salmagundi.—-1 calf’s foot, 1 pig’s foot, 1 lb. lean beef cut into small pieces. Put them together in a stew-pot with three pints of cold water, some peppercorns, lemon rind, and parsley, and let them simmer till the liquid is reduced to a pint. Strain through a colander and leave till next day, the meat in one basin and the liquor in another. Then skim off all the fat, take the bones out of the meat, cut the meat up small, and put in a stew-pan with the liquor. Season to taste, and let it get quite hot and well mixed. Pour into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water and let it get quite cold, and then turn out and garnish with parsley. It should be rather highly seasoned. Kromeskies.—These can be made of cooked beef, mutton, veal, or any kind of poultry. Make some batter with four ounces58 MEAT. of flour, a pinch of salt, and a quarter of a pint of lukewarm water. Stir into this about two tablespoons of salad oil, and at the last moment dash in the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. The meat or poultry must be freed from skin and bone, and finely minced and seasoned. Make a little white sauce with an ounce of butter put in a saucepan, and an ounce of flour stirred smoothly into it, and a quarter of a pint of cream. Let it boil, and then add a pinch of mace, salt, and cayenne, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and add the meat. Mix it well together, and as soon as it is smooth and stiff, turn it on to a plate to cool. Cut small slices of bacon as thin as wafers, and about three inches long and two inches broad. Spread a heaped-up teaspoon of the mince on each slice, and roll it up tightly in the bacon. Put each kromesky separately in a spoon, and dip it in the batter, and fry it in boiling fat with the batter that is in the spoon. The kromeskies will only, take about a minute to cook, and they must be drained on kitchen paper. Pile them on a dish and serve with tomato sauce. Liver and Bacon.—Cut the liver into slices a quarter of an inch thick, and dip each slice in flour, seasoned with pepper and salt. Fry some bacon gently in a frying-pan, and when it is cooked put it on a hot dish to keep warm before the fire. Lay the slices of liver in the hot fat, and fry them first on one side and then on the other, till they are very thoroughly cooked. They will take about a quarter of an hour. For the gravy, mix a dessert-spoon of brown flour smoothly with about a quarter of a pint of water. Pour this into the frying-pan, season it, and stir till it boils and thickens. Pour it through a strainer over the liver, but not over the bacon. Serve very hot. Potted Beef. —Procure i lb. of nice lean beef, free it from skin and gristle. Put it in a jar (if at hand one with a lid), with one tablespoon of water. Cover it closely and place in a saucepan of boiling water; let the water be about two inches from the top of the jar. Stew till tender, pass it three times59 MEAT. through a mincing machine, with a quarter-pound of lean ham. Mix all together with 2 oz. of butter, a salt-spoon of salt, one of pounded mace and one of pepper, and a dust of cayenne, and a little gravy if needed. Pound it all together in a mortar. Fill some small pots and cover with melted butter. Potato Cutlets.—Boil i| lbs. potatoes well, pass through a fine sieve, and mix in the yolks of two eggs. Season with pepper and salt. Take about a tablespoon of the mixture and make into balls, flatten out with a spoon, then take any kind of cold meat chopped finely, seasoned with pepper and salt • lay a little of the meat on the potato, then place another layer of potato on the top, press the sides together, flour, or dip them into egg and bread-crumb. Fry a light brown. Pork Pie (for one large pie).—2 lbs. of loin of pork, fat and lean mixed, cut in small pieces, and seasoned with teaspoons of white pepper and teaspoons salt. 2 lbs. of flour, 10 oz. of lard, 1 gill of milk, 1 gill of water, one small teaspoon of salt. Bones and rind for gravy. Warm the flour, rub into it 5 oz. of lard, boil up the other five ounces of lard with 1 gill of milk and 1 gill of water, make a hole in the flour in which the other lard has been mixed, pour in the boiling ingredients, mix first with a knife and then press into a ball with the hands, beat well with a rolling-pin till the paste is quite smooth. Cut off a piece for the lid of the pie. Form the rest of the paste into a high cone, and gradually work into a case for the meat with the hands. When finished the case should stand about five inches in height. Press the meat in well, put on the lid, make two holes in the top for the steam to escape. Bake two hours or longer in a moderate oven. The bones and rind of the pork should be put in a saucepan with three quarters of a pint of water and eighteen peppercorns and half a teaspoon of salt, and stewed for two hours. When the pie is baked pour into it gently through the holes at the top as much gravy as it will hold ; this should be repeated two or three times whilst the pie is cooling.6o POULTRY. How to Choose it.—The skin of fowls and turkeys should be clear, white, and finely grained, the breasts broad and meaty, the legs smooth, the toes pliable and easily broken when bent back, and the birds heavy in proportion to their size. White-legged fowls should be chosen for boiling, but the dark-legged ones are often the best flavour for roasting. To Truss Poultry —This must be learnt by demonstration. To Boil Chickens or Fowls.—White-legged fowls should be chosen for boiling, as they are a better colour. After they are trussed and singed and prepared for boiling, rub the breast with a lemon cut in half, and then tie over it a piece of butter-paper. Put them breast downwards into fast-boiling water; boil for one minute, then draw the saucepan back and simmer very gently for about three quarters of an hour, or for an hour if the birds are large, or for two hours if they are old fowls. When done, place on a hot dish and cover with white sauce (page 91), and garnish with yolk of egg rubbed through a sieve and sprinkled on the breast, and rolls of fried bacon should be placed round the dish. To Roast a Chicken or Fowl.—After the chicken is trussed and singed, dredge over it a little flour, rubbing it quite smooth with the fingers. Cook in front of the fire or in the oven. Baste frequently with bacon fat or butter. The time to cook the fowl will depend on its size and age, and will vary from thirty-five minutes to an hour. Serve with brown gravy and bread sauce, and bacon fried in little rolls put round the dish. Fowl Fricasseed.—Prepare the fowl for cooking, skin and cut it into joints, and lay them in a stew-pan with some strips of bacon rind scalded and scraped, two cloves, one carrot, a little parsley, thyme, a bay-leaf and blade of mace, salt and peppen and a small piece of lemon rind. Just cover the fowl with stock or water and simmer gently for three quarters of an hour, then6 I POULTRY. drain off the stock and leave it to get cold, and skim off the grease. In another saucepan fry some button mushrooms, unless you use bottled ones, when it is not necessary. Melt two ounces of butter in the stew-pan, and mix one ounce and a half of flour very smoothly with it, a teaspoon of lemon juice and six pepper- corns, then add the stock the chicken was cooked in, and simmer till it is reduced to a pint. Strain the stock and put it back into the saucepan with the pieces of chicken and the mushrooms, add a gill of cream and a little cayenne, and let it get very hot, but it must not boil, as the cream would curdle. Pile the chicken in a silver dish and pour the sauce over it, and garnish with sippets of toast. A few truffles are an addition to the gravy. Rice, boiled as for curry, can be piled round this dish instead of having sippets of toast, and is sometimes very much liked. To Mince Chicken.—Cut the flesh off the bones of a cooked chicken. Free it from skin and sinew, and mince it finely by hand. Season with salt, pepper, a small pinch of mace, and half a teaspoon of grated lemon rind. Put it into a stew-pan with sufficient white sauce or cream to moisten it. Simmer gently without boiling till it is quite hot, stirring all the time. Garnish writh sippets of toast and little rolls of fried bacon. Chicken Pie.—If a young fowl is used it can simply be jointed and packed in the pie-dish ; but if an old one is used it must first be boiled. Have the fowl for the pie skinned, not plucked, then cut into small joints, taking out the bigger bones. Have ready two or three hard-boiled eggs and a seasoning of 2 tea- spoons of flour, 1 of pepper, and 1 of salt mixed together on a plate. Dip each piece of fowl into the mixture on the plate and place in the dish between each layer slices of hard-boiled egg, some strips of cooked bacon or ham, fill up to the top of the dish, having egg and bacon as the top layer. Make some gravy with the giblets and other parts of the fowl that are not needed for the pie, and pour some of this into the pie-dish. Cover the pie writh pastry ; brush it over with the yolk of an egg. Make a hole in the top of the pie. Bake62 POULTRY. two and a half hours, at first quickly and then slowly, with oiled paper over the crust to prevent it burning. Stewed Chicken with Tomatoes and Mushrooms. When the chicken is prepared for cooking, cut it into small joints. Melt 2 oz. of butter in a stew-pan and fry a small minced onion in it for a few minutes, then fry in the same butter the pieces of chicken, and season with salt and cayenne ; when these are fried a golden brown, pour over them 15 pints of white stock, four tomatoes peeled and cut in half, and half a pint or less of button mushrooms. Mix a small tablespoon of arrowroot to a smooth paste with a little cold water and stir to the stock till it boils, then draw it back and simmer gently for three quarters of an hour ; add a small pinch of powdered mace, a dessert-spoon of minced parsley, and simmer for a quarter of an hour. Pile the chicken on a dish and pour the sauce over, garnish with tomato, parsley, and sippets of toast. To Prepare a Chicken for an Invalid.—Take a good-sized but young chicken, and boil it for thirty minutes ; take off all the white meat and put on a plate; then take the remainder of the chicken with a little of the liquor in which it was boiled, and a small piece of mace and lemon rind, and let it simmer till the bones will come out quite clear, and strain it. Pound the white meat of the chicken in a mortar with some of the liquor added to make it the thickness of good cream. This may be taken either warm or cold. The feet of the chicken should be stewed with the bones. Quenelles.—Take the crumb of some new bread, steep it in tepid water for ten minutes, then put it in a clean cloth and wring it tightly. Put the crumb into a stew-pan with 2 oz. of butter, a little salt, and two tablespoons of white stock. Place on the fire, con- tinuing to stir the panada the whole time with a wooden spoon till it assumes the appearance of paste and no longer adheres to the bottom of the pan, add 3 yolks of eggs, turn it out on a plate, smooth it over the surface with the blade of a knife, and havingPOULTRY. 63 covered it with a piece of buttered paper, place it in the larder till required for use. Then take of the panada and fresh butter half a pound of each, to these add 1 o oz. of prepared chicken or yany ’ other poultry. Cut the meat off a cooked chicken or turkey, chop it finely and rub it through a wire sieve with the back of a wooden spoon. Pound the panada and the butter and chicken to- gether in a mortar; when well mixed add salt to taste, as much mace as will cover a sixpence, a little pepper, one egg, and a little white sauce. Pound the whole quickly, take the mixture out of the mortar, put it in a basin and keep on ice or in a cool place until wanted for use. Divide the forcemeat into small portions and roll into balls. Flour lightly and put them in a stew-pan half full of boiling water. Let them simmer for four minutes and serve with white sauce. To Roast a Duck.—Ducklings should not be stuffed, but ducks should have a stuffing of sage and onions. Put them to roast at a clear bright fire, and keep them constantly basted. A short time before they are done dredge them with flour, and baste well with butter. They will take from three quarters of an hour to an hour to cook, according to their age. The gravy must be made from the necks, gizzards, and livers, and boiled up again in the dripping-pan after all the dripping has been poured off. The stuffing is made with a quarter of a pound of onions, a teaspoon of powdered sage, three tablespoons of bread-crumbs, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and cayenne. Mix well and put inside the duck. Apple sauce (page 84) is served with ducks. Duck Stewed with Green Peas.—Half a pound of lean bacon cut into little pieces and fried in butter. Dredge in a teaspoon of flour and stir for three or four minutes, then add a pint of stock, an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper. Fry the duck in a little butter or roast it before the fire for ten minutes to make it a good colour, then put it into the stew-pan with the gravy, and stew it slowly for about an hour and a half. Boil a quart of peas, and saute them with butter by shaking them64 POULTRY. in a saucepan with a little butter. Put the duck and the peas on a hot dish, thicken the gravy and strain it, pour over the duck and peas, and serve very hot. Wild Duck.—Pluck, draw, and truss the bird ; flour it well; roast it in front of a sharp, clear fire for twenty or thirty minutes, basting well with butter. It is an improvement to the flavour if the carver, after scoring the breast, squeezes a lemon dipped in cayenne over it. Only the breast is good to eat. Serve with gravy, adding half a glass of port wine, or with savoury orange sauce (page 88). To Roast a Goose.—Roast or bake in the usual way. The stuffing is made with % lb. of onions parboiled, 2 teaspoons powdered sage, 4 tablespoons bread-crumbs, pepper and salt. Cut the onions very fine and mix with the other ingredients after parboiling them. Truss it and fill with sage and onion stuffing. The goose can simply be stuffed with small apples, not peeled or cored. Sew up the openings of the bird securely, baste well, and roast for about two hours according to size. For the gravy boil some of the giblets and pour the stock from them into the dripping- pan after the fat has all been poured off, with two teaspoons of flour, and boil up. Serve separately. When the goose is stuffed with sage and onions serve apple sauce (page 84) in a tureen. Gravy for Roast Goose.—Slice an onion, chop it small, and fry it in a little butter till lightly browned. Pour over it a pint and a quarter of stock made from the giblets, etc., add a bunch of parsley, six peppercorns, and a little salt. Mix a dessert-spoon of browned flour to a thick smooth paste with a little cold water and add to it, and stew the gravy gently for an hour or more; it should be as thick as cream. Strain and serve in a tureen. To Hash Goose.—Cut into neat slices the remains of a roast goose and dredge a little flour over them. Put into a stew-pan any gravy that may be left, *and a small quantity of the stuffing, and add a little pepper and salt. Shake the pan over the fire till thePOULTRY. 65 gravy is quite hot, draw it to the side of the fire, and put in the slices of goose and let the hash simmer gently for a quarter of an hour. Grouse.—Let the birds hang as long as possible. Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside and out. Roast in a Dutch oven before a bright fire, basting well with butter. A little flour must be dredged on the breasts before they are quite done. They will take from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes. A piece of toast should be put under the birds a few minutes before they are ready. They should be served at once when they are cooked. Bread sauce, gravy, and fried bread-crumbs must be served with them, and they should be laid on the toast on the dish. Good gravy must be used, and a spoonful or two of sherry is an improvement to it. Guinea-fowl.—They are roasted in the same way as chickens except that a piece of fat bacon should be tied over their breasts, or they should be larded. Jugged Hare.—Prepare the hare for cooking; cut it into pieces, dredge them with flour, and fry in boiling butter. Drain them and put them into an earthenware stew-pot with a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions stuck with 3 cloves, 3 whole allspice, ^ tea- spoon pepper, a strip of lemon rind. Cover with hot water, and when it boils skim it. Let it simmer for about two hours, or longer if the hare is old. Take out the pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and two tablespoons of mushroom catsup and a wineglass of port wine ; let it boil about ten minutes, strain through a sieve, and pour over the hare. A few forcemeat balls should be fried or stewed in the gravy for about ten minutes. Serve red currant jelly with the hare. Forcemeat for Hare.—\ lb. beef suet, 2 oz. raw ham or bacon, 1 teaspoon chopped parsley, 1 teaspoon mixed herbs. Add grated rind of half a lemon, five ounces bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt. Bind the mixture with the yolks of two eggs. Roast Hare.—Roast or bake in the usual way, stuff with forcemeat, and sew it up with soft cotton. Truss it with the 566 POULTRY. hind legs forward and the fore-legs back, and put a skewer down the mouth and one in each ear to keep the head in position. Put slices of fat bacon over its back to keep it moist, and baste with cream or milk till it is nearly cooked, then dredge with flour and baste well with butter. It will take from an hour and a half to two hours to cook, according to its size. For the gravy pour off the fat, and pour into the dripping-pan some good brown gravy, thicken, boil, and serve in a tureen. Red currant jelly must be served with hare. Larks Broiled.—Pick and clean the larks, cut off their heads and legs, truss them firmly, rub them over with beaten egg, and strew bread-crumbs over them. Broil them over a clear fire, and serve them on fried toast. They take about ten minutes to broil. Larks Roasted.—Place the larks in a tin in the oven, dredge with flour and baste them with butter. When they have been cooking about ten minutes put a piece of toast under them. Partridges.—Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside and out. Roast before a bright fire or in a brisk oven, basting well with butter. A little flour must be dredged on the breasts before they are quite done. They will take from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes. A piece of toast should be put under the birds a few minutes before they are ready. They should be served at once when they are cooked. Bread sauce, gravy, and fried bread-crumbs must be served with them, and they should be laid on the toast on the dish. Pheasants.—Let the birds hang as long as possible and pro- ceed as for partridges. Allow from three quarters of an hour to an hour to cook them. Pigeons.—Tame pigeons taste better if cooked as soon as possible after they are killed. Wild pigeons should hang a few days before they are eaten. Pigeon Pie.—3 pigeons, I lb. beefsteak, 3 hard-boiled eggs, a few slices of cooked ham or bacon cut in strips. Cut the pigeons into four pieces and the beefsteak into very small strips.POULTRY. 6; Have ready on a plate 2 teaspoons each of pepper, salt, and flour. Dip each piece of pigeon and beefsteak into this mixture. Lay some pieces of pigeon at the bottom of the pie-dish and pack in little rolls of beefsteak round them, add a layer of slices of hard- boiled egg and a few little pieces of bacon or ham ; fill up to the top, making it higher in the middle, and having a layer of egg at the top and some pieces of fat bacon. Put the giblets of the birds and the heads skinned and the feet (reserving three feet to put in the hole at the top of the pie) into a saucepan with a little pepper, salt, mace, bacon rind, and water, and make into gravy. Pour some of this into the pie, and reserve some to add boiling through the hole at the top when the pie is baked. Cover the pie with pastry and brush over with yolk of egg, and bake at least two and a half hours, at first briskly and then slowly, to cook the meat, putting a greased paper over the crust. To Roast Pigeons.—Pluck, draw, and singe some young pigeons, and fill with either forcemeat or bread and butter, cut into dice. Tie thin slices of bacon over their breasts, dredge them with flour, and put them down to a clear fire; baste with bacon fat or a little butter. They will take from twenty-five to thirty minutes to roast. For the gravy, pour into the dripping- pan half a pint of boiling stock or water ; add a tablespoon of sherry and a teaspoon of the forcemeat; season with salt, cayenne, and mace, and thicken with the yolk of an egg well beaten. Send the gravy to table in a tureen, and bread sauce in another. Serve the birds on a piece of toast. For the forcemeat, if bread and butter is not considered sufficiently tasty, mince the livers finely and mix with them the same quantity of finely sliced suet and grated bread-crumbs. Add a little pepper, salt, and mace, and a heaped tablespoon of chopped parsley, a pinch of powdered thyme, and moisten the whole with the beaten yolk of an egg. To Stew Pigeons.—Pluck, singe, and draw as many as are required, and truss as if for boiling. Stuff them with slices of bread and butter, thickly sprinkled with pepper and salt, and cut68 POULTRY. into small dice. Brown them for ten minutes in front of the fire, basting well with butter or bacon fat. Make some good gravy of the trimmings of the pigeons by putting the heads and feet (skinned) and livers into a saucepan with a little stock and three or four peppercorns and a small bunch of herbs. Put this gravy (strained) into a stew-pan and lay the pigeons in it, and stew them very gently for an hour and a half. Take out the pigeons, and keep them very hot whilst you thicken the gravy with a little browned flour, and season it with pepper and salt; and add, if liked, a tablespoon of sherry or mushroom catsup. Ptarmigan.—Proceed as for partridges (page 66). Quails.—Pluck and draw the birds and roast before a quick fire, baste with butter and dredge with flour ; serve on toast. They take about fifteen minutes to roast. In drawing the birds reserve the liver and trail; cook in a little butter and pound them and spread over the toast on which the birds are placed, adding a little pepper and salt. The birds can be roasted without being drawn at all, in which case take care that the toast catches what- ever of the trail may fall. To Boil Rabbits.—After they are prepared put them into a saucepan with as much boiling water as will cover them; let them boil up, skim the liquor, and simmer gently till done, which will be in about an hour. Put them on a very hot dish and cover them quite over with onion sauce (page 87). Boiled or broiled bacon may be served with them if liked. To Curry Rabbit.—Cut up a rabbit into small pieces. Chop up one onion and one apple; put ^ lb. butter into the stew-pan and fry the onion in it; when the onion is a nice brown, strain it out, put on a plate, and return the butter to the stew-pan. Put in the rabbit and fry a light brown; add one tablespoon curry powder, one pint stock, the chopped apple, and a little salt; let it simmer for half an hour. Take out the rabbit, reduce the gravy by boiling fast, strain it; add one gill of cream, the juice of half a lemon, pour over the rabbit, and serve with a dish of boiled rice.POULTRY. 69 To Fry Rabbit.—Quite young rabbits are very nice just cut into neat pieces, floured, and fried in butter. Jugged Rabbit.—After the rabbit is prepared, cut it up into joints, and fry it in a saucepan with 2 oz. of butter and forcemeat balls. When the rabbit is nicely browned put it into an earthen- ware stew-pot with a lid and cover it with some stock, add pepper, salt, mace, and a bunch of herbs, one onion, two tablespoons of mushroom ketchup, and a thickening of flour. Place the lid on the jar and put it in a brisk oven, and let it remain there for two hours, then take out the joints of rabbit and put the forcemeat balls in the jar to get warm. Take them out and put in a dish with rabbit, and strain the gravy over. Serve red currant jelly with the rabbit. Rabbit Pie.—I large rabbit, or 2 young rabbits, 2 hard-boiled eggs, I lb. boiled bacon, flour, salt, pepper. Cut the rabbit into small pieces, take out the breast-bone, and bone the legs. Cut the bacon into small thin slices, mix on a plate 2 teaspoons each of pepper, salt, and flour, and dip each piece of rabbit into the mixture before arranging it in the pie-dish. Put pieces of rabbit at the bottom of the dish, slices of hard-boiled eggs between each layer of meat, and the thin slices of bacon rolled. Pack so that the meat is higher in the centre than at the sides, and put egg and bacon as the top layer. Have ready some gravy made of the bones of the rabbits that you did not use for the pie, and pour over the meat sufficient to three parts fill the pie-dish, reserving some to put in when the pie is cooked through a funnel put in the hole at the top of the pie. Cover the pie with pastry and brush over with yolk of egg. Make a big hole at the top of the pie, and keep open whilst baking, or a rabbit pie may become poisonous. To Roast Rabbit .—Truss the rabbit as you would a hare ; fill the paunch with veal stuffing (page 54), and roast it before a clear fire, or bake it in the oven for about three quarters of an hour, basting well with butter. Ten minutes before it is cooked dredge with flour. When done take out the skewers, put it on a70 POULTRY. hot dish, and serve with brown gravy, bread sauce, and red currant jelly, or with apple sauce. Salmis of Game.—Roast the birds, but do not let them quite finish cooking. Cut them up in joints and remove the fat, skin, and sinews from the legs, wings, and breasts. Set them on one side till wanted. Put two ounces of butter in an enamel saucepan and three ounces of lean ham finely minced and a dozen button mushrooms, half a scraped carrot, a few sprigs of parsley and thyme, three cloves, a bay-leaf, twelve peppercorns, and a slice of lemon rind. Stir over the fire till the sides of the sauce- pan appear slightly coloured, dredge in a tablespoonful of flour and let it brown, and then pour in gradually a pint of stock and a large wineglass of sherry. Put in the trimmings of the birds and the bones, and let the sauce boil up ; then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire and let the sauce simmer gently for an hour and a half till it is smooth, thick, and well flavoured. Skim carefully and strain and set aside to get cold, then take off the fat and warm it up in a saucepan, put in the joints of game, and let them slowly get very hot, but on no account boil. Lay the meat in a dish and pour the gravy over and garnish with sippets of toast. To Roast Snipe.—This wants very little cooking. Pluck the bird, singe it and truss it, but do not draw it. Cook it before a brisk fire or in a fierce oven for about fifteen minutes. Serve on toast. Baste with butter and dredge with flour. To Roast Teal.—Teal should be lightly cooked. They should be plucked and drawn, cooked before a quick fire or in a fierce oven, and basted with butter. Cut lemon and cayenne should be sent to table with them, and a little gravy served in a tureen. To Boil Turkey-—-Proceed exactly the same as for boiled fowls, only allow a longer time, and serve with white sauce (page 91) or oyster sauce (page 88). To Hash Turkey.—Cut the remains of a cold cookedPOULTRY. 7* turkey into neat slices and dredge a little flour over them. Put into a stew-pan any gravy that may be left, and add a little pepper, salt, and mace. Shake the pan over the fire till the gravy is quite hot. Draw it to the side of the fire and then put in the slices of turkey, and let the hash simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Cut the forcemeat balls into slices and warm these in the oven or before the fire. Arrange the hash on a hot dish, pour the gravy over, and garnish with alternate slices of forcemeat, sippets of toast, and pickled walnuts or gherkins. For the gravy to warm up the meat in, supposing there is none left, put the skin, bones, and trimmings of the turkey into a saucepan with a pint of stock, a bunch of herbs and parsley, four cloves, and some sliced mush- rooms if you have any. Simmer the sauce gently for an hour, strain it, season with pepper, salt, and mace, and thicken with the pounded liver of the turkey and a little browned flour. Just before sending to table add a teaspoon of lemon juice or a table- spoon of wine. To Mince Turkey .—Cut the meat off the bones, free it from skin and sinew, and mince finely by hand, season with salt, pepper, and mace, and a little grated lemon rind, and put it into a stew-pan with sufficient white sauce (page 91) to moisten it. Let it simmer gently without boiling till it is hot, stirring all the time. Garnish with sippets of toast and little rolls of fried bacon. To Roast Turkey.—After it is trussed, stuff the crop of the turkey with veal forcemeat (page 54) and sew up. Tie a piece of buttered paper over the breast, baste well with butter. Just before it is done remove the paper and dredge with flour, and baste well to brown it. It will take, according to the size, from one hour and a half to two hours and a half to cook. The bird may be stuffed with sausage meat if preferred, or chestnut force- meat. To Re-dress Turkey.—The meat can be used for patties, mince, rissoles, or in any of the other ways given for re-cooking poultry or meat; or it can simply be cut into neat pieces and72 POULTRY. warmed up in some good gravy made from the bones and well seasoned. Devilled Turkey Drumsticks.—Make a mixture of i oz. of butter, a teaspoon of mustard, a salt-spoonful of black pepper, a salt-spoonful of cayenne, and a little lemon juice. Score the drumsticks down parallel with the bone, and insert in these slits the devilled mixture ; then rub the drumsticks with butter and grill them over a fierce fire. These are much better prepared the night before they are wanted.73 VEGETABLES. Vegetables.—All vegetables, except potatoes, Jerusalem arti- chokes, and dried peas and beans, should be put into plenty of fast-boiling water which has been salted and skimmed. New potatoes must also be put into boiling water. Greens, lettuces, etc., must be soaked in very strong salt and water to fetch out the insects. The lid must be kept off the pan in which green vege- tables are cooking that they may keep their colour, and the water kept fast boiling. A piece of crust tied in muslin and put in the pan will lessen the unpleasant smell given off when boiling. To Boil Globe Artichokes.—Soak the artichokes in strong salt and water, cut the stalks even, trim away the lower leaves, and cut a little piece off the ends of the others. Plunge the artichokes with the stalks uppermost into quickly boiling salted water. Leave the lid off the saucepan, and boil the artichokes until the leaves can be drawn out easily. They will take from half an hour to an hour, according their size and age. Oiled butter (page 87) or Dutch sauce (page 85) is to be served with them in a tureen. To Boil Jerusalem Artichokes.—Wash, brush, and pare the artichokes. Put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water, slightly salted, to cover them. Let the water boil, skim it well, and boil the artichokes till they are tender, which ought to be in twenty minutes after the water boils. The lid must be kept on the pan. Drain the artichokes, and serve with melted butter (page 87) over them. The artichokes will turn black if left in the pan after they are done. To Boil Asparagus.—Scrape very clean all the white part of the asparagus stalks and throw them into cold water. Tie them in bundles and cut the stalks even. Then put the bundles into a saucepan, with the points at the top, and fill it only three parts full with hot water a little salted, so that the tops of the asparagus are not touched by the water. Boil fast for forty74 VEGETABLES. minutes. If boiled in an ordinary wide stew-pan, where the bundles have to lie in the pan covered with water, twenty minutes is enough after the water boils. Serve the bundles on a slice of toast, having first removed the string. Serve with oiled butter (page 87). To Boil Beetroot.—Wash it without breaking the skin, boil for two hours ; let it get cold, and then cut it in slices and pour vinegar over it. To Boil Broad Beans.—Shell them and throw into cold water, drain them, and put into a saucepan of boiling water, previously salted and skimmed. When they are tender, which will be in twenty to thirty minutes according to their age, pour them into a hot colander, drain thoroughly, and put into a vegetable dish. Pour parsley sauce (page 88) over them. To Mash Broad Beans.—Boil some beans, that are too old to serve in the usual way, for more than an hour. Take off the hard skins and mash with a little bacon fat. Add pepper and salt and put into a saucepan to warm, stirring all the time or shaking the saucepan. ' To Boil French Beans.—Cut off the ends of the beans and peel off the string that runs down each side, cut them into strips and drop them into cold water, drain them and throw into a saucepan of fast-boiling water previously salted and skimmed ; boil till tender, which will be in about fifteen minutes, but if old, half an hour; pour them into a hot colander to drain. Put a little piece of butter into a saucepan, which should have been dried, and shake the beans in it, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over them and serve. To Boil Haricot Beans.—Soak the beans all night, and remove those that float in the water. Boil in cold water about two hours, strain, and put back in a saucepan with a little piece of butter, some chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Shake them till all are coated with butter and serve very hot. To Boil Broccoli.—Strip off the dead outside leaves, and cut75 VEGETABLES. the inside ones even with the flower ; cut off the stalk close, and put it head downwards into a pan of strong salt and water for an hour; shake it and wash it in another water and plunge head downwards into a saucepan of boiling salt and water, and boil quickly with the lid off for from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, according to the size. Skim the water several times. Drain and serve with melted butter (page 87). To Boil Brussels Sprouts.—Pick off all the dead leaves and throw the sprouts into salt and water for an hour. Then put them into a saucepan of fast-boiling water to which a little salt has been added. Keep it boiling, with the lid off the pan, for about a quarter of an hour. Drain in a colander and serve very hot. The water should be skimmed several times while they are boiling. To Boil Cabbage or Savoys.—If the cabbages are very large they must be quartered ; soak them for an hour in strong salt and water. Drain in a colander and put into a saucepan of fast-boiling water to which some salt has been added. Keep the pan uncovered and skim the scum off as it rises to the surface. Drain, press, and serve very hot. To Boil Cauliflowers.—Put the cauliflowers head down- wards in strong salt and water for an hour. Drain them in a colander, and put them head downward into a saucepan of fast- boiling salted water ; keep the pan uncovered, and boil them quickly till they are tender, which will be from twelve to fifteen minutes, or longer if they are very large. Skim the scum off the water as it rises. When done drain and serve with melted butter (page 87). Cauliflower au Gratin (1).—Boil a cauliflower in the usual way, and then cut it up into small pieces and arrange them in a fireproof dish. Pour a cupful of oiled butter (butter simply melted) over them; strew over them a quarter of a pound of grated Parmesan cheese. Season with cayenne and salt. Brown in the oven or before the fire. Cauliflower au Gratin (2).—Make some white sauce. Boil7 6 VEGETABLES. a cauliflower. Add to the sauce a tablespoon of thick cream, salt, cayenne, and one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Squeeze the water from the cauliflower with a cloth, cut off the outside green leaves. Put it on a dish and pour the sauce over it, sprinkle over it another ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, and brown it before the fire. To Boil Carrots.—Very young carrots will only want washing, older ones must be scraped. Put them in a stew-pan, with sufficient hot water to cover them, and a little salt. Let them boil for twenty minutes, take them out, and serve in a hot dish, and pour over them parsley sauce (page 88). Carrots au Beurre.—After the carrots are boiled, drain them, and put two ounces of butter in a saucepan, and strew in some chopped parsley, salt, and white pepper; then add the carrots, and toss them very gently till they are covered with the sauce, which must not be allowed to boil. To Stew Celery (Brown).—Wash the celery and trim it. Put it into a saucepan with boiling water and let it boil five minutes. Drain it and put it into a stew-pan with stock to cover it, and stew it gently for half an hour or till it is tender. Thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and add pepper and salt to taste, boil a quarter of an hour longer, and serve the celery with the sauce poured over it. To Stew Celery (White).—Wash the celery thoroughly and trim it. Plunge into boiling water to which a little salt has been added. Boil till tender, which will be from fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve with white sauce. To Curry Vegetables.—3 large potatoes, 1 pint brown stock, 4 oz. butter, 2 onions, f lemon (juice of), i vegetable marrow, | pint of green peas, i pint of French beans, a few slices of cucumber, 1 tablespoon curry powder. Peel the potatoes, cut in small strips, and fry them with one onion sliced in two ounces of butter till they are golden brown ; put them into a stew- pan with the stock, one raw onion, and all the other ingredients.77 VEGETABLES. Simmer very slowly, stirring carefully occasionally until the vege- tables are nearly cooked, then add two ounces of butter and a little brown flour to thicken the gravy. Cook until the vegetables are quite soft, but not broken. Season with salt and pepper. Lettuces.—These should be dipped in cold water, shaken dry in a soft cloth, and put in a colander to drain ; set in a cold place, but not cold enough to freeze. This treatment will make them very crisp, and they will keep twenty-four hours. Lettuces should not be cut with a knife, but torn into pieces with the fingers just before they are wanted for a salad. To Stew Lettuces.—Strip off the outer leaves and cut away the stalks, wash them and throw into salt water to soak. Throw into boiling water previously salted and boil till tender, which will be in about twenty-five minutes. Take them out and drain and press the water from them. Chop them a little and heat in a saucepan with a little butter, pepper, and salt; then add a small cup of stock, boil them quickly till nearly dry, and add a few drops of lemon juice. Serve with fried sippets of bread. To Boil Leeks.—Trim off the coarser leaves, cut the leeks into equal lengths, tie them in small bunches, and boil them in plenty of boiling water which has been salted and skimmed.

Mushrooms as a Vegetable.—Stew them in milk and water, add a little pepper, salt, and cayenne, and thicken the gravy with cream or a little butter rolled in flour. To Stew Mushrooms.—Pull out the stems and peel the mushrooms. Melt a slice of butter in a stew-pan, add a tea- spoon of salt, half as much pepper, and a pinch of powdered mace. Put in the mushrooms, the upper side downwards, and let them stew gently till they are tender ; they will take fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve on buttered or fried toast. To Stew Spanish Onions.—Put an ounce of butter in the stew-pan, remove the skin of the onions and put them in the stew-pan. When they are a little browned remove to the side of78 VEGETABLES. the range and keep gently stewing three or four hours, closely covered with the lid. Serve with the gravy that is in the pan with them when they are finished. To Boil Parsnips.—Wash and scrape the parsnips, cut them into quarters, and throw into boiling water salted and skimmed. They will take from half an hour to an hour, and can be served whole or mashed. To Boil Green Peas.—Shell the peas, but do not leave them too long before using them. Put them in plenty of boiling water with some salt, and one or two sprigs of mint. They will take from fifteen to twenty minutes to boil, according to the age o( the peas. Pour off the water, and drain the peas well. Put a piece of butter in the saucepan, and a little salt, and shake the saucepan over the fire to coat the peas with the butter. Serve in a very hot dish. To Boil Potatoes.—Wash the potatoes well, choose those that are about the same size, using big ones for one day and small ones another, or some will be better cooked than the others. Peel the potatoes and throw them into cold water, and then put them into a saucepan with enough cold water to cover them, and a little salt. Let them boil as slowly as possible, and if they are boiling too fast throw in a little cold water to check them. They will take from twenty to thirty minutes to cook after the water boils. A fork should be stuck in to make sure the potatoes are done. Throw away the water, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt, and leave them at the side of the fire with a cloth over the saucepan, and the lid half off. Let them remain so for about ten minutes, and give the saucepan a shake occasionally. To Steam Potatoes.—Wash some potatoes, peel them, and throw them into cold water. Put them into a strainer, fill the saucepan belonging to it with boiling water, put on the lid, and let the potatoes steam for about half an hour. Test them with a fork, sprinkle them with salt and serve quickly, or they will turn black.79 VEGETABLES. To Boil New Potatoes.—Scrape or rub the skins off and throw the potatoes into cold water. Put them in a saucepan and cover with boiling water, sprinkle with a little salt and put a small sprig of fresh mint in the water ; put the lid on the saucepan and boil till tender, which will be in about a quarter of an hour. Pour off all the water, and lay a clean cloth over the potatoes, put the lid on again, and let the pan stand by the side of the fire till the potatoes are dry. Melt a little butter in a saucepan, and toss the potatoes in it. Serve very hot, and if liked sprinkle a little chopped parsley over them. To Bake Potatoes.—Wash the potatoes with their skins on, and cut a little bit off the end of each. Choose potatoes of an equal size. Bake in a moderate oven from one and a half to two and a half hours, according to their size and the heat of the oven. Serve on a hot dish in a napkin. To Mash Potatoes.—Boil or steam the potatoes, then put them through a potato masher, or mash with a fork till quite free from lumps. Melt half an ounce of butter in a saucepan with two tablespoons of milk, and pepper and salt to taste, mix with the mashed potatoes, let them get hot, and serve in a very hot dish. If they are wanted extra good, more butter can be used and a little cream, and they should be well whipped. To Brown Potatoes.—Wash and peel the potatoes, and partly boil them. When they are half cooked, take them up, drain them, and put them in the dripping-pan under the meat; let them remain till they are cooked through and equally browned all over. They will take about three quarters of an hour. If not convenient to put under the meat, they may be baked in a brisk oven till brown, being basted occasionally with dripping ; or placed in a tin before a hot fire. Potato Balls .—Yolks of 2 eggs, i tablespoon cream, parsley, i oz. butter. Boil or steam 2 lbs. potatoes, and mash them.

Mix thoroughly, and make the paste into balls, roll them in egg and bread-crumbs, and fry in a frying basket in boiling fat. Potato Balls (economical).—Proceed as in the previous receipt, but use less butter, and milk instead of cream. The balls must be well drained on kitchen paper before serving. To Fry Potatoes .—Wash and pare some potatoes, and cut into very thin rounds and throw into cold water. Have ready some boiling fat, drain the potatoes, and dry them on a cloth ; put them, a few at a time, into a frying basket, and plunge into the boiling fat. Let them remain till they are of a light brown colour. Put them upon a plate covered with kitchen paper, and set near the fire to drain and keep hot; let the fat boil up again, and put some more potatoes in the frying basket, and drain them in the same way. Serve very hot. Potato Mould.—The remains of cold potatoes. Mash them well, and to every pound add half an ounce of butter, and a little cream or milk. Press into a well-buttered mould, and bake in a moderate oven for about half an hour. Potato Scallops.—i lb. potatoes (cooked), £ oz. grated Parmesan cheese, i oz. butter, | teaspoon chopped parsley, i egg, a little cream.

Boil some fat, and when it is quite ready and aVEGETABLES. 81 blue flame is rising put the potatoes into a wire basket, and plunge them in the fat. Shake them to keep them from sticking together. Draw the saucepan to one side, and let them simmer for about five minutes till the potatoes are quite tender, then take the basket out and make the fat boil up again. Put the potatoes in the frying basket back into the saucepan of boiling fat, and again draw it aside. In about two minutes they will be ready to drain on paper and serve. Sprinkle them with salt. To Stew Potatoes.—Pare and cut into slices a quarter of an inch thick 2 lbs. potatoes, and throw into cold water for half an hour. Put them in a stew-pan with sufficient white stock to cover them. When tender, drain off most of the stock, and pour in a cupful of milk or cream. Boil about five minutes, stirring constantly. Add a lump of butter the size of an egg, rolled well in flour, a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Boil up once, and serve very hot. Potatoes a la Maitre d’Hdtel.—Boil 2 lbs. potatoes of a firm kind, and let them get cold ; cut them into slices a quarter of an inch thick, and then into pieces of the same size with a round cutter. Melt 2 oz. of butter in a saucepan, stir to it a small dessert-spoon of flour, and shake the pan over the fire for two or three minutes; add slowly a small cup of boiling water or white stock, some pepper, salt, and a tablespoon of chopped parsley ; put in the potatoes and toss them gently over a clear fire until they are quite hot and the sauce adheres well to them. At the instant of serving add a dessert-spoon of lemon juice. Potato Salad.—Cut some cold boiled potatoes into fairly thin slices ; put them into a salad bowl with a teaspoon of chopped parsley, half a teaspoon of eschalots chopped very fine (these may be omitted), two tablespoons of oil, two of cream, and two of vinegar; season with a little pepper and salt, and toss all carefully together -without breaking the vegetables.

Drain it on a hot colander and serve on toast. Pour white sauce over it. Spinach.—Pick the spinach leaf by leaf from the stems and wash it in several waters to thoroughly clear it from grit. Put it into a saucepan with only the water that adheres to the leaves, and sprinkle a little salt over it. Cook till quite tender, which will be in about ten minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid burning. Drain it and press the moisture from it. Rub through a wire sieve, put it into a clean saucepan with a little butter and pepper and salt. Fried sippets of bread should be served with this. Poached eggs can be served on the spinach. Baked Tomatoes.—This is a very simple but a very good way of cooking tomatoes when you want them as a vegetable. Cut off a very small piece from the stem end of the tomatoes and insert a dust of salt, cayenne, and a little bit of butter ; place the tomatoes in a dish and bake them in a moderate oven for an hour. Serve them in a vegetable dish very hot. To Boil Turnips .—Put them into boiling water salted and skimmed, and boil about twenty minutes, or longer if they are not very young. They must be pared and thrown into cold water before they are boiled. To mash them rub them through a wire sieve and put back in a saucepan to insure their being quite dry, then add some butter, salt, cayenne, and milk or cream, and continue to simmer and stir for five or six minutes till they have absorbed all the liquor. Serve very hot. To Boil Vegetable Marrow.—Peel the marrow, remove the seeds, cut it in quarters, and boil in boiling water previously salted and skimmed. Drain the pieces of marrow and serve on toast. Pour melted butter over. Stuffed Vegetable Marrow (entree).—Pound to a paste in a mortar equal parts of veal and ham or chicken; then pass them through a sieve, and return them to the mortar. Work into the paste thus obtained a fourth of its bulk of butter, and about the same quantity of bread-crumbs with the yolks of two eggs, add 583 VEGETABLES. a teaspoon of chopped parsley, season with pepper, salt, and a small pinch of mace. Cut a moderate-sized vegetable marrow in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds, fill each half with the stuffing, place the halves together, and wrap up the vegetable marrow in buttered paper and tie with tape, put it in a deep buttered tin or a pie-dish, and cover with another dish ; bake in the oven for an hour; take it carefully out of the paper, put in a silver dish, and pour clear gravy or tomato sauce over it.84 SAUCES. Anchovy Sauce.—Make some melted butter according to the recipe given for it (page 87), and add just before serving sufficient anchovy sauce to colour and flavour it. Apple Sauce.—Six apples, b ox. butter, t ox. sugar. Peel the apples, slice and put them in a saucepan with a tablespoon of water ; cover the pan, and set it over a moderate fire till the apples are soft, then beat the apples to a pulp, add the butter and sugar, and boil up.

Serve with roast turkey. Custard Sauce.—3 eggs (yolks only), f pint milk, vanilla. Boil the milk in a double saucepan. Have ready the yolks of the eggs beaten up. Pour the boiling milk very gradually over them, stirring well all the time. Pour the mixture back into the double saucepan, and stir till the custard thickens. The saucepan must not be put back on the fire after the eggs have been added. The heat of the boiling water in the outer saucepan is quite sufficient, and custard made in this way will never curdle. A flavouring of brandy can be added when the custard is made. Dutch Sauce.—4 eggs, 2 oz. of butter, 1 tablespoon of chilli or Tarragon vinegar, 2 tablespoons of cream, a dust of pepper, salt, juice of half a lemon. Put the yolks of the eggs well beaten into a stew-pan with the cream, butter, vinegar, and season- ing.

WhenSAUCES. 86 wanted it should be melted in a jar and the meat painted with it with a brush; when one coating is dry a second may be given. The stock can be made of i dessert-spoon of Lemco. Horseradish Sauce.—Grate a stick of horseradish very finely, and mix 2 tablespoons of it with a pinch of salt and a little more than a tablespoon of vinegar or as much as will moisten the whole, add two tablespoons of cream, mix well, and serve cold. A little made mustard mixed with it is an improvement. Jam Sauce.—5 lb. of any kind of jam, water enough to make it liquid. Simmer the jam and water together, rub it through a hair sieve, add a few drops of lemon juice or wine, and serve very hot. A teaspoon of arrowroot may be used to thicken it; only in that case it must be boiled. Lobster Butter.—Pound together in a mortar the spawn and coral of a boiled hen lobster, add to it double its weight of butter and a pinch of cayenne. Pass through a sieve, and keep in a jar in a cool place. Lobster Sauce.—Make half a pint of white sauce (page 91). Cut up about a quarter of the white meat of a lobster into small square pieces. Put these into the white sauce with enough lobster butter (see abdve) to colour it, and a pinch of cayenne, and heat without allowing it to boil. Maitre d’Hotel Butter.—Equal quantities of butter and chopped parsley, cayenne, salt, a little lemon juice. The butter and parsley must be measured by bulk, not by weight.

Baked Fruit Pudding. —Make it exactly the same way as a boiled pudding, but bake it instead of boiling it. Boiled Fruit Pudding.—Make some suet crust. Butter a pudding basin, line with some of the paste; fill with fruit of almost any kind ; add sugar, and a little water if the fruit is apples. Cover with crust, pinch the edges together, wring out a cloth in boiling water, flour it inside and place over the pudding, tying firmly. Put into plenty of boiling water, and let it boil two and a half hours. Turn out of the basin and serve. It must be kept covered with water and boiling all the time. Compote of Fruit.—Boil sugar and water together in the proportion of one pound loaf sugar to one and a half pints water, and skim well. When the syrup is clear drop in the fruit and simmer gently till the fruit is cooked, but do not let it lose its shape. For strawberries make the syrup of the juice of red currants boiled with sugar instead of water, and simply pour it over the strawberries instead of cooking them in it. Fruit and Cream Bread Pudding.—Line a basin with slices of bread half an inch thick soaked in boiled milk. Fill the basin with any stewed fruit and put another thick slice of soaked bread on the top; cover with a plate and put a heavy weight onSWEETS. IP5 the top and leave all night. Turn out the next day and cover with thick whipped cream. Half a pint of cream. Fruit Cream.—1 pint of the juice of any fruit, 1 oz. gelatine, f lb. castor sugar, 1 pint cream (or milk). Dissolve the gelatine in a very little water. Stew the fruit gently till the juice is extracted, and then strain it and leave till cold. Add the gelatine to the fruit juice, and let it soak for half an hour. Then add the sugar and boil till the syrup looks clear, and stir in gradually the cream (cold). Rinse a mould in cold water and pour in the fruit cream and set it aside to get cold, and turn it out. It makes a prettier but more expensive dish to use a mould with a hollow centre and fill this with whipped cream. For a plain sweet for children use milk instead of cream. Raspberries and strawberries are better not cooked. Fruit Salad.—Make a syrup of sugar and water in the pro- portion of one dessert-spoon of white sugar to half a pint of water, and boil till dissolved. Have ready some oranges peeled, quartered, and cut up, also some bananas sliced, some grapes, and some pine- apple cut up small; pour the syrup over the fruit whilst it is hot. Add a little lemon juice, and some of the juice of the pineapple squeezed in lemon squeezers. This salad can be made of any mixture of fruits, and white wine or a liqueur may be added if liked.

Put the gelatine and water into a saucepan, and let it dissolve slowly. Boil the milk and sugar, and pour it on to the beaten yolks of the eggs, stir well all the time with a silver fork. Pour the eggs and milk back into the saucepan, and set it over a very gentle heat. Stir vigorously until the custard thickens, and on no account allow it to boil. Pour it again into the basin, and add the dissolved gelatine and the ginger syrup, set it on one side to cool, and stir it now and then. When the custard is nearly cold add the cream, and when it has just begun to set add the chopped ginger, and pour the mixture at once into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water. Set it in a cool place, and turn out when cold. Gateau de Prunes.—1 lb. prunes, 1 oz. gelatine, 1 lemon, a few almonds, ■§■ pint water, sugar to taste, and cochineal to colour.

Blanch and skin the almonds and prune kernels. Put the prunes and kernels back into the syrup. Colour with the cochineal and put into a border mould. When quite cold dip the mould in warm water and turn out. Fill the centre with whipped cream and stick the sliced almonds into the mould like a porcupine’s quills. Gooseberry Fool.—Cut off the stalks and tops of 1 quart gooseberries, and put them in a stew-pot with a cup of cold water107 SWEETS. Rub them through a coarse hair sieve. Let the pulp get cold, and then mix it gradually with J pint of whipped cream. Greusze.—Stew currants, raspberries, or blackberries, and rub the fruit through a coarse hair sieve.

Put it back in the saucepan and boil till it thickens, then pour it into a basin, and when it is cool mix in the sugar and butter and the beaten eggs, and put the pudding into a buttered pie-dish and bake in a very slow oven. It is a great improvement to put a deep rim of pastry round the pie-dish before putting in the pudding. Ground Rice Mould.—2 oz. ground rice, 1 pint milk, i| oz. white sugar, flavouring. Mix the ground rice with a very little cold milk to a smooth paste. Put the remainder of the milk with the sugar and flavouring into a saucepan, and let it boil.

Pour the jelly into a mould rinsed first in cold water. How to Use Chivers’ Jellies.—Melt the packet of jelly in a little less than the amount of water specified, and make up the deficiency by using wine or the juice of oranges or lemons. For orange or lemon jelly grate the rind of an orange or the peel of a lemon in the water and boil it for ten minutes. Strain and melt the jelly in it, adding the wine or juice of the fruit. Junket.—Heat a quart of milk till it is lukewarm. Put into a cup half a teaspoon of powdered cinnamon, a tablespoon of castor sugar, and half a wineglass of brandy (this may be omitted).

Beat these ingredients in a hot basin set over a saucepan of boiling water till they are frothy. Pancakes.—The batter for these should be made some hours before it is wanted for use. It should be quite smooth, and of the consistency of thick custard. The proportions are one tablespoon of flour, and a quarter of a pint of milk to each egg. The whites and yolks of the eggs should be whisked separately, then add them to the flour, and when it is quite smooth add the milk or cream. Have a clear fire, and a small, clean frying-pan with some boiling lard in it. Pour in enough of the batter to cover the pan thinly. The edges of the pancake should be kept free from the pan with a knife, and the pan must be shaken lightly to prevent sticking. When the batter is set and nicely brown, the pan should be taken hold of at the end of the handle and lightly jerked upwards so as to turn the pancake completely over; brown on the other side and serve with cut lemons. Pommes a la Dauphine.—Peel and take out the core from 2 lbs. of apples, taking care to keep them whole, put them into a stew-pan, buttered at the bottom, add a very little water, a piece of cinnamon, a tablespoon of brandy, and 2 oz. sugar; put the stew-pan on a gentle fire to keep the apples whole; when done take them off the fire and place them in a mould or deep dish, the contents should rise rather above the level of it; put into each apple a spoonful of apricot or any other jam, and a small piece of candied lemon.

U4 Puff Pastry (Plain).—i lb. flour, 4 oz. lard, 6 oz. butter, 1 tea- 3 a wineglass of sherry and £ a wineglass of brandy, add sugar and nutmeg to taste. Sufficient for eight jelly-glasses. General Remarks on making Pastry.—Pastry must be made in a cool place, and with a light hand. The oven must be very hot when the pastry is first put in. Short pastry is the most digestible kind, and will keep well for a week in a tin. Puff paste is much better eaten on the day or the day after it is made. Puff Pastry (Superior).—r lb. butter, i lb. very fine flour, a few drops of lemon juice, yolks of two eggs. Mix a pinch of salt with the flour, and make it into a paste not too stiff with the lemon juice and eggs and a little cold water. Use a knife to mix it with. Mix till quite smooth, and then set on ice or in a draught to get quite cold. The flour must be perfectly dry and put through a sieve. The butter should be squeezed in a cloth to extract every atom of moisture from it. Then flour the marble slab or the board on which you are going to make the pastry, and the rolling-pin, and roll out the paste lightly and neatly and only one way; then put the butter in the middle of the paste (if the butter is very hard knead it soft first) and fold the ends and sides over it so as entirely to cover it. Then roll out the paste again, and be careful to roll it straight and not to let the butter break through ; then fold over one third of the length, flatten this slightly with the rolling-pin, and fold the other third over the top and set it aside either on ice or in a draught of cool air. Keep it there for a quarter of an hour. Then again roll it out twice with the rough edges towards you each time, just as you did before. Again put the paste on ice or in a draught for a few minutes and repeat till the pastry has been rolled out seven times. Put it on ice for a few minutes, roll it out about a third of an inch thick and it is ready for use. Pastry must be baked in a quick oven or it will be entirely spoilt. If you have made more pastry than you want, roll it up and keep it till the next day in a cool dry place, and bake it, then it will be quite good.SWEETS. 115 spoon of lemon juice, water. See that the flour is very dry; put it through a sieve. Rub in the lard with the tips of the fingers and mix it into a smooth paste with the water and lemon juice, using a knife, and taking care not to make it too wet. 1 urn it out on a floured pastry board, and roll it out till it is about half an inch thick; spread it with dabs of butter; sift over a little flour ; fold it up, roll out again, and spread more butter on it. Do this several times till all the butter is used up. It makes better pastry to put the paste on a baking sheet over ice or in a cool place for twenty minutes, and then to roll it again, but this is not necessary for ordinary plain pastry. Pastry for Meat Pies.—io oz. flour, 6 oz. lard, salt, i teaspoon baking powder, cold water. Rub the flour through a sieve. Mix in a basin with the baking powder and a pinch of salt. Rub in the lard lightly with the fingers, moisten with a little cold water, and mix with a knife. Roll out and use at once. Short Pastry.—i lb. flour, 6 oz. butter, and 4 oz. of lard, the yolk of an egg, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of castor sugar, about 3 tablespoons of water, a pinch of salt. Mix the salt and sugar with the flour. Crumble the butter and lard into the flour with the tips of the fingers. Make a hole in the crumbs, and put in the yolk of an egg, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and the water. Mix lightly but thoroughly with a knife or the hands. Roll out about a quarter of an inch thick, and use for fruit pies or tartlets. The pastry will be richer if 10 oz. of butter is used and no lard. To Boil or Steam Puddings.—Grease the basin or mould. Scald the cloth that is used to tie over it and flour it inside. Plunge the pudding into boiling water, and add more boiling water as it boils away. For jam rolls and suet rolls use no basin, but roll the pudding in a scalded and floured cloth and tie loosely at the ends and in the middle with string. A plate should be put at the bottom of the saucepan. To steam puddings without a steamer let the water come half-I 16 SWEETS. way up the basin only, and keep it gently simmering all the time. No cloth need be used, but a piece of butter-paper should be tied over the top of the mould. Caramel puddings will curdle if the water boils.

Stone the raisins, mince the suet very fine, grate the lemons, and mix all the dry ingredients together. Beat the eggs, strain them, mix with the other ingre- dients, and add the brandy. Stir most thoroughly till everything is blended well together. Sufficient for four puddings. They must be boiled for at least six hours when made. These puddings should be made a few weeks before Christmas, and hung up in a dry place. They must be boiled again four hours before using. They should be served with sauce royale (p. 89) or brandy sauce (p. 90). Plum Pudding.—6 oz. raisins, 6 oz. bread-crumbs, 2 oz. flour, 4 oz. sugar, 6 oz. currants, 6 oz. suet, 5 eggs, 3 oz. citron, lemon, and orange peel, | nutmeg, i grated lemon rind, i wine- glass of brandy.

When these things are well mixed stir in the well-beaten eggs and the brandy. Butter a mould, pour in the mixture, and boil for four or five hours. These ingredients can be increased when several pud- dings are to be made, and then they must be boiled longer if they are for keeping. Serve with brandy sauce (page 90) or sauce royale (page 89). Raspberry or Strawberry Cream.—1 quart of raspberries, 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of double cream, 1 oz. gelatine, | lb. castor sugar. Raspberries and strawberries are better not cooked.

Soak the gelatine for half an hour in the milk, and boil it till clear and add the rest of the sugar. Stir the cream in gradually, and when it is cold add the puree of strawberries or raspberries and put the mixture into a mould that has been rinsed in cold water. Set in a cool place till next day. Raspberry Fool.—Same as Gooseberry Fool (page 106), only the raspberries must be rubbed through a finer sieve. Rice and Apple Pudding’.—4 oz. rice, apples.

Spread it on a dish, and set it aside to cool. When quite cold roll it into balls, and dip them into yolk of egg and a little sugar, sprinkle them with bread-crumbs, and fry them. When done dredge sugar over them, and serve with a sauce of hot fruit or jam syrup in a tureen (page 86). Rice Pudding (Baked).—2 tablespoons of rice, ii pints of milk, sugar to taste, and a very small piece of butter. Wash the rice in several waters, and leave it to soak in the milk as long as possible before it is wanted. It is better set the night before.

Pears must be peeled and cored and cut in quarters lengthways, or in halves, and put in the stew-jar with enough claret to cover them, a little sugar, and a few cloves; the lid must be put on, and they must be left to simmer for an hour or two until they are soft. If claret is not used, and water pre- ferred, a little cochineal must be added to colour them. Strawberry Cream.-—The strawberries must be picked free from their stalks and a little white sugar sprinkled over them, then rub them through a hair sieve without being cooked at all, and mix with whipped cream. Sago, Apple, and Custard.—Boil some sago in the pro- portion of one tablespoon of sago to half a pint of hot water. Stew some apples wdiich have been peeled, cored, and sliced in an earthenwrare jar.

Blanch the almonds, cut them into spikes, stick all over the cake, and pour round it the custard (page 85). Trifle.—According to the size of the dish you require take small sponge cakes ; about six is a good number. Cut them lengthways and spread them with jam ; raspberry is the best. Put them together again and arrange in a dish, first three at the bottom, then two more, and on the top one, so that they form a small pile. Prick and pour over them as much sherry or mar- sala as they will soak up. Make a rich thick custard and pour over the cakes, and last of all cover with a high whip of rich cream, slightly sweetened. A few ratafias can be used as well as the sponge cakes, and are a great improvement, and these must also be soaked with wine.

Pour the batter into the tin under the meat, after the tin has got hot and greasy from being under the joint.124 CAKES. General Directions for Cake making. —All the ingre- dients must be of the finest quality. The flour must be dried and put through a sieve. The least damp in any of the ingredients makes the cakes heavy. Currants should be washed and picked and dried when they are bought, so that they are ready for use at any time. Never allow yourself to be interrupted when making cakes ; get all the materials ready to hand on the kitchen table, and go straight on when you have begun to make your cake, without stopping to do other things. See that your oven be the proper heat when you are ready to use it. For ordinary plum cakes good cooking eggs will do if fresh ones are not obtainable, but for sponge cakes it is absolutely necessary to have new-laid eggs, or they cannot be made well. The whites of pickled eggs or stale eggs will not whip properly. Always remember to re- move the specks from every egg you use. The best thing to use both for beating and stirring cakes is a large silver fork. For light cakes a brisk oven is required to raise and set them; very large rich ones require a well-sustained heat to bake them through; small sugar cakes a slow oven to prevent their taking a deep colour before they are half done; gingerbread requires a slow oven. Never bang the oven door; any draught or shaking of the cakes when they are half risen will make them heavy. Sheets of buttered paper should be put over the tins to prevent the cakes burning. Hints on Baking Cakes and Pastry.—The oven should be hot at first and allowed to get cooler when the cakes have risen. When you begin making cakes or pastry see that the kitchen fire is made up, and then test the oven at intervals by putting in a piece of white paper. If the paper turns dark brown directly it is put in, the oven will be ready for small pastry ; if light brown, for fruit tarts, etc. ; if dark yellow, for large meat or game pies and pound cakes, and when only just tinged yellow it is right for sponge cakes, meringues, etc. If the oven burns at the125 CAKES. bottom stand your cake on a small trivet. It is generally well to put a piece of buttered paper over the top of the paper that the tin is lined with. Shut the oven door slowly and gently. Almond Biscuits.—1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. flour, 6 oz. butter, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 3 eggs, 30 drops essence of almonds, a few almonds. Melt the butter and beat in the eggs. Mix the baking powder and sugar with the flour, then add the butter and eggs and essence of almonds. A little of the sugar must be reserved to roll the biscuits in. The biscuits should be about the size of marbles. They must be put on a tin far apart, and a small piece of almond stuck in each one. Bake in a quick oven about ten minutes. Almond Icing.—The whites of 3 eggs, 1 lb. sweet almonds, I lb. castor sugar, a little rose-water. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff" froth, beat the almonds very fine in a mortar with the rose-water, mix the almonds lightly with the eggs, and the sugar by degrees. When the cake is sufficiently baked, take it out of the oven, lay the almond paste on, and put it back to brown. Arrowroot Buns.—1 lb. arrowroot, | lb. butter, | lb. castor sugar, | lb. currants, 2 eggs, wineglass of sherry or white wine.. Beat the butter to a cream, add the other ingredients by degrees. Butter some patty-pans and half fill with the mixture, and bake in a quick oven a pale brown. Bread.—This is quite easy to make, and if a little of Leconte’s extract of malt is added the bread is made very much more digestible and nourishing. The proportions are for 7 lbs., flour II oz. German yeast, 1 dessert-spoon malt, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of Demerara sugar, about 3 pints lukewarm water. Put the flour into a deep earthenware pansion in front of the fire. Mix the salt with the flour. Break up the yeast into small pieces in a basin with the sugar. Put the malt into a cup and mix it with warm water, and then add it to the yeast. Make a hole in the middle of the flour and pour in the yeast. Cover the pansion with a cloth and leave for half an hour near the fire till the yeast126 CAKES. has risen. Then pour in the remainder of the warm water and mix all together with a wooden spoon into a dough ; knead well till quite smooth and the dough leaves the hands and sides of the pan quite clean. Cover again with a thick cloth and leave on a chair before the fire to rise. This takes from ifto 2 hours. Then divide the dough and make into loaves. Place the loaves on a floured baking sheet to rise in front of the fire for fifteen minutes, and then bake in a quick oven. Twenty minutes after the bread is put in the oven open the door for a minute to let out the steam. A loaf weighing 4 lbs. will take two hours to bake. Bread Cake.—Take il lbs. of the dough of which the bread is made, after it has been kneaded, and add £ lb. of butter or good beef dripping, i lb.

In another small basin put 1 oz. yeast with one teaspoon of castor sugar, and stir with a wooden spoon, add 3 gills of lukewarm milk and mix well. Make a hole in the middle of the flour and strain into it gradually the yeast and milk, mixing them into the flour with a wooden spoon. When smoothly mixed cover the basin with a cloth and set near the fire for about an hour, or until the sponge is covered with bubbles. While the sponge is rising prepare the other ingredients127 CAKES. thus :—Put in large basin ii lbs. flour. Rub i lb. of butter into this; add the fruit and castor sugar. When the sponge is ready, beat into it with your hand the other dry ingredients you have prepared; this takes plenty of strength ; at intervals add the two well-beaten eggs. Continue kneading till you can pull the whole lump of dough out without it sticking to the basin. Now cover the basin again with a cloth and set in a warm place till the surface cracks ; this will take about 15 hours. Have ready some flat well-greased tins; shape the dough into round balls and place them a good distance from each other on the tin ; place the tins in a warm place for twenty minutes till the buns have risen.

If they are cooked too fast they become tough. Remove instantly when done and lay on a hot dish. Add to the gravy from the kidneys a little stock thickened with flour, boil up once, pour over the kidneys, and serve. Kidneys are also sometimes fried in the frying-pan in which bacon has been cooked, and the bacon fat does instead of butter, and 10146 BREAKFAST DISHES AND SAVOURIES. they are then served in the same dish as the bacon. For breakfast they are very nice this way. To Broil Kidneys .—Skin the kidneys carefully, but do not slice or split them. Lay for ten minutes in warm (not hot) melted butter, rolling them over and over that every part may be well basted. Broil on a gridiron over a clear fire, turning them every minute. They should be done in twelve minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and lay on a hot dish with a bit of butter on each. Omelette aux Fines Herbes.—2 oz. butter, 4 eggs, salt, pepper, chopped onion, parsley. Beat the eggs well, whites and yolks separately, and add the herbs and seasoning. Put the butter into the pan 3 when quite hot put in the other ingredients, stir well, and as soon as it begins to set at the bottom of the pan lift it up with a knife to let the liquid get under it; repeat this till nearly all the liquid has gone underneath and become set. Fold the omelette in half before taking it out of the pan, and bind the edges together with the egg that is still not set. Serve immediately. Sweet Omelette.—Make this exactly like the preceding recipe, but omit the herbs and use a little jam, putting a spoonful between the omelette when it is folded. Porridge.—Oatmeal can be fine, medium, or coarse. Half a pint of water is enough for one plate of porridge. Put as much water as is required into a saucepan with a pinch of salt, and let the water boil. With a knife sprinkle the meal in gradually, stirring all the time. When the porridge is sufficiently thick draw the saucepan back a little, put on the lid, and let it simmer gently till wanted, the longer the better. If coarse oatmeal is used it is best to soak it all night and put it on the fire in the morning directly it is lighted. A basin of sugar and a jug of milk or cream should be served with porridge. Sausage Meat.—Cut the meat from the bones and stew the bones with as much water as wall barely cover them till they haveH7 BREAKFAST DISHES AND SAVOURIES. made a strong gravy.

Peas and French beans can be preserved in the same way. Chestnut Soup.—-Strip the outer rind from some fine Spanish chestnuts, throw them into a large saucepan of warm water ; just be- fore the water boils take out the chestnuts, peel them quickly, and throw them into cold water, wipe, and weigh them ; take * of a lb.149 ODDS AND ENDS. for each quart of soup. Cover them with good stock, and stew them gently for an hour, or until they break when touched with a fork. Drain, pound them smoothly, and rub them through a fine sieve; mix with them slowly the proper quantity of stock, add sufficient mace, cayenne, and salt to season the soup, stir often till it boils, i of a pint of cream will greatly improve the soup. Part of the stock in which the chestnuts were boiled can be used for the soup if the sweetness is not objected to. Chutnee.—3 dozen apples peeled and cored, cut into eight pieces, ^ lb. preserved ginger scraped, 1 oz. mustard seed picked and washed, 6 shalots, 5 Spanish onions cut in thin slices, i| oz. small bird’s-eye chillies, £ lb. salt, 2 lbs. coarse brown sugar, 3 quarts brown vinegar, 4 oz. sultana raisins.

Fry a good brown 5 oz. meat, three vegetables of any kind—cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, broccoli, for preference ; but not lettuce or spinach. Mix well together with a dessert-spoon of curry powder and salt. Add to the onions, and cook until all is a yellow colour. Add a teacup of gravy (water will do if fresh meat), 1 tablespoon vinegar. Simmer gently till meat is quite tender. Curry Powder.—Mix 8 oz. coriander seed, 4 oz. cunien seed,*5° ODDS AND ENDS. 3 drachms Nepaul cayenne, 6 oz. curcuma root, i oz. black pepper i oz. cardamom seed, i oz. carraway seed, i oz. fenugreek seed.

Cool Drink.—1 pint of clear barley water, the juice of three oranges, the rind of one orange grated on a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, 1 bottle soda water, ice. Then take one third of a French roll, well browned in the oven, and put it into the bever- age quite hot and cover it over. Cocoa Nibs.—These are more digestible than ordinary cocoa. The only secret in the success of making good cocoa from them is to stew them a great many hours, and make it the day before it is wanted, so that the fat can be skimmed off the cocoa when it is cold. Three ounces of cocoa nibs to a quart of water are good proportions. Put the nibs in an earthenware stew-pot and add the water cold ; let it boil, and then keep simmering all day. Set aside at night, and skim and boil up when wanted.ODDS AND ENDS. 151 To make Coffee.—To preserve the aroma of coffee the berries should be roasted at least once a week, ground just before using, and warmed before the fire. For making coffee use a fireproof china coffee-pot with a percolator. Make it hot with boiling water, pour this away, and put in the strainer one table- spoon of coffee for every cup required and one over, press the coffee down and put the upper part of the strainer on the pot. Pour about a third of a pint of fast-boiling water slowly through the top strainer, put on the lid, set the pot on the stove to keep hot, and add from time to time the remainder of the water you require quite boiling, and slowly. It will take about twenty minutes or half an hour to make coffee in this way. Before sending to table take out both strainers and put the lid on the lower half of the pot. Coffee made in this way will be strong, clear, fragrant, and hot. Cafe Noir.—Make the coffee in the same way as in the pre- vious recipe, but use one tablespoon of coffee to a quarter of a pint of water. Pickled Damsons.—Boil together 1 quart brown vinegar, 3 lbs. Demerara sugar, 1 oz. thick cinnamon, for ten minutes. Pour it over 3 lbs. damsons, which should have been previously pricked with a needle and placed in a basin. Cover with a plate and leave for three days, when drain off, boil ten minutes, and pour over the fruit again. Next day, boil plums and syrup together for five minutes, and then put into jars and cover down while hot. Damson Cheese.—Boil the fruit till tender, and rub it through a hair sieve till the fruit is like a paste; then add six ounces of loaf sugar to every pound of pulp, stir off the fire till it is dissolved, and then boil the preserve again, stirring con- tinuously till it leaves the pan quite dry and adheres to the spoon in a mass. Press it into little moulds, and when it is cold put a piece of paper soaked in brandy over the top, and fasten another piece of paper over the mould. A few of the damson stones should be cracked, the kernels taken out,ODDS AND ENDS. 152 blanched and chopped, and added to the damson cheese when it is boiling. To Cook Eggs without Boiling.—Eggs are lighter and easier to digest if they are put into a basin of boiling water and kept closely covered for eight or ten minutes, instead of boiling them over the fire. To Preserve Eggs.—Mix together i lb. of fresh lime, i gallon of boiling water, stir with a stick, then put it by and stir well once a day for three days. Place the eggs in layers in a deep brown jar, the pointed ends down, and pour in the lime water so that it covers the eggs about three inches. Only the clear water is used, and must be taken off the lime after it is well settled. Put a cover on the jar, and if the water evaporates fill up with more lime water. Before May is the best time to pickle eggs. They will keep good a very long time, but the eggs must be quite fresh when put in the pickle. Fennel Sauce.—Boil some fennel in a little water till tender, then pound it in a mortar and rub through a sieve; add salt to taste. Make | pint white sauce, and add sufficient fennel to make the sauce quite green. To Cook Fish for an Invalid.—Place the fish between two plates over a saucepan of boiling water and cook for six minutes. The fish can be seasoned with a little butter, pepper and salt, or it can be served plain. Ginger Beer.-—3 lbs. loaf sugar broken small, £ lb. whole bruised ginger, 2 oz. cream of tartar, the peel and juice of 3 lemons. Lay these ingredients at the bottom of a pan, pour upon them two gallons of boiling water. Cover with a thick cloth; when nearly cold put one tablespoon of brewer’s yeast on a slice of toast, and let it float on the ginger beer, cover the pan, and let it ferment twenty-four hours. Strain and bottle it. In three days it will be ready for use. How to make Jam.—The fruit must be picked when it is quite dry, and should be quite sound. Good lump sugar must be1 53 ODDS AND ENDS. used. If the glasses or jars in which the jam is to be kept are not absolutely dry the jam will ferment, so they must be washed and dried some time before they are wanted. After the fruit is freed from stalks or stones, as the case may be, it must be weighed. Then put it in the preserving pan and let it boil; stir and skim it. After it has boiled a few minutes add the sugar. The quantity to use varies with the fruit; strawberries and rasp- berries and the sweeter kinds take less than the more acid fruits. As a general rule three quarters of a pound of sugar should be used to every pound of fruit; damsons require a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. After the sugar is added the jam should boil steadily, but not too rapidly, till it sets when a little is put on a plate ; this is generally from half to three-quarters of an hour. It is best to add the sugar when the preserving pan is off the fire, or the jam might burn. The jam must be allowed to get cold in the jars, and then they should have paper soaked in brandy laid inside the jars on the top of the jam, and parchment or paper soaked in milk must be fastened over the top of the jars to exclude the air. In the case of stone fruit the stones must be most carefully skimmed off; they rise to the top when the fruit is boiling. Cherry Jam.—This is made in the same way as other jams (see Directions for making Jam), but the cherries must first be stoned. This is easily and quickly done with a little instrument that is sold for this purpose. If you pull out the cherry stalk and then insert the instrument into the cherry at the end where the stalk has come out, you will extract the stone without losing any of the juice. The fruit must be weighed after it is stoned, and half a pound of sugar is the allowance for a pound of sweet cherries, and a pound of sugar for a pound of Morelia cherries. Red, Black, or White Currant Jelly, and Blackberry Jelly •—Pick the fruit free from stalks, and put it into a preserving pan, and stir gently over a clear fire till the juice is extracted. The fruit should cook slowly. Then turn the fruit into a hair154 ODDS AND ENDS. sieve, and let it drain well, but without pressure. Pass the juice through a fine cloth or jelly-bag, first rinsed in boiling water, and then weigh the juice. Boil the juice fast for a quarter of an hour, and take the pan off the fire and add the loaf sugar, crushed to a powder in the proportion of half a pound of sugar to a pound of juice; stir it off the fire till the sugar is dissolved, and then boil the jelly again quickly for ten minutes. The scum must be carefully taken off during the boiling. Seville Orange Marmalade.—Rub the oranges with a clean cloth, do not peel them, but divide them into quarters, slice very thinly with a sharp knife, and take out the pips. To each pound of sliced fruit add one quart of water; let it stand twenty-four hours. Then boil it until the peel is tender; let it stand again till next day, then weigh fruit and water together, and to every pound add one and a quarter pounds of loaf sugar. Boil the whole until the sugar jellies and the peel is transparent, about three-quarters of an hour. To four dozen oranges add six lemons. Crab Apple Jelly.—Allow a pint of water to every pound and a half of crab apples, and boil gently till the apples are broken, but not fallen to a pulp. Pass through a jelly-bag, and when the juice is quite transparent weigh it and put it into a preserving pan ; boil quickly for a quarter of an hour, take it off the fire and add the sugar, three parts of a pound to every pound of juice; stir till it is dissolved, and then put it back on the fire and boil fast about twenty minutes. Strain very carefully, and pour into moulds. The crab apples should be rubbed clean, but not peeled or cored. Syrup of Currants or Blackberries.—Slightly warm the fruit and squeeze the juice from it with a wooden spoon, strain it, and set it aside in a basin, and let it stand in a cool place for twenty-four hours; then pass it gently through a fine hair sieve, using no pressure, and again put it through a jelly-bag rinsed out in hot water, or a cloth. Weigh the juice, and add an equalODDS AND ENDS. 155 quantity of loaf sugar broken small; leave this to dissolve, and then turn the syrup into a preserving pan, and boil gently for five minutes. Skim carefully. Pour the syrup into a basin or jug to get cold, and twelve hours afterwards bottle and cork it. Take care that the bottles are absolutely dry. This syrup makes a good sauce for puddings either hot or cold. Green Gooseberry Paste.—This preserve is much nicer than jam for eating, but not so useful for cooking purposes, so that it is well to make the ordinary kind of gooseberry jam as well as this. Cut the stalks and tops off the fruit and bruise it slightly. Boil till the fruit is quite soft; then rub it through a hair sieve and weigh it, and put it back in the preserving pan with the sugar. Allow three quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit pulp. Good loaf sugar must be used. Boil for about half an hour, stir- ring all the time to prevent it burning, and it must be well skimmed. The preserve should set when cold into rather a stiff paste. Rhubarb Jam.—Cut the rhubarb in pieces about an inch long, put it in an earthenware pan, and lay an equal weight of crushed loaf sugar over it, and let it stand twenty-four hours; then strain all the syrup from the fruit and boil it gently about twenty minutes. Add the pieces of rhubarb and boil until they look clear, and be careful not to boil it too much or it will candy. Green rhubarb looks the prettiest when done. Marrons Glaces.—4 dozen chestnuts, 1 lb. sugar, 1 pint water. Boil the chestnuts gently, take them from the fire, and peel them. Boil the sugar and water to a syrup. Keep stirring the whole time or the sugar will burn. Take off the scum as it rises, add the chestnuts, which must be whole. Boil gently in the syrup for about fifteen minutes, stirring them the wTole time (too fast boiling will break the chestnuts). Then remove from the fire and place them on a sieve until dry. They must be kept in a dry place. Meat Jelly for Invalids.—2 lbs. shin of beef, ii lbs. of veal.156 ODDS AND ENDS. Cut the meat into small pieces quite free from skin and fat, and put them into a jar with two tablespoons of cold water, a very little salt, and six peppercorns. Tie the jar down with bladder or oiled paper, and set it in a saucepan half full of cold water. Let it simmer seven hours without intermission, then strain through muslin. When it is cold take off the fat. Minced Meat for Invalids.—Raw meat or poultry, from which every scrap of skin, fat, and sinew has been removed, very finely minced by hand. Sprinkle a little salt on it, put into a saucepan, and heat it with either a very little bit of butter or a drop of water. When it is hot through it is done. If it boils it is hard. Orange Salad.—6 oranges, I wineglass brandy, 2 oz. castor sugar, and 6 lumps sugar. Rub 6 lumps of sugar on the rinds of the oranges, and put them in a glass dish. Reel the oranges and carefully remove all the white pithy part. Cut into thin rounds, remove the pips, lay them in the dish, strew with sugar, pour the brandy over them, and cover the dish with a plate till the salad is required. How to lard Poultry or Meat.—A larding needle is neces- sary. Some fat bacon must be cut into strips about two inches long, a quarter of an inch wide, and an eighth of an inch thick. It is best to use bacon that has been boiled for white meat, or it will colour it red. Rut each strip into the larding needle and pass the point of this through as much of the fowl or joint as will hold the bacon safely, then draw the needle and bacon half through so as to leave equal ends projecting. This must be done at equal intervals and in regular rows till the meat is covered evenly. The breasts only are larded of poultry or feathered game, the backs and thighs of rabbits and hares. It is easier to lard poultry if the part to be larded is dipped for a moment into boiling water. Lemonade.—Pare very thin the rind of two lemons and put into a jug, then carefully remove the white pith from the lemons. Slice them and take out the pips, put the slices with the rind into a jug with about an ounce of loaf sugar. Pour over a pint and aODDS AND ENDS. *57 half of boiling water, cover with a cloth, and let it stand till cold. Stir, strain, and use. Paste for Sticking.—2 even teaspoons of flour, 1 breakfast- cup of water, powdered alum sufficient to cover a threepenny- piece. Stir the flour into a smooth paste with a very little cold water and fill the cup up with boiling water, stirring all the time to prevent it getting lumpy. Then pour it into a saucepan and boil; stir constantly, and when it is just ready add the alum. Leave it to get cold, it is then fit to use. Pot Pourri.—\ oz. bottles of essence of bergamot, essence of cassia, oil of ambergris, 2 dozen cloves grated, 1 oz. bay salt broken into small pieces. Rose leaves well dried and mixed with all sorts of sweet-smelling leaves, such as lavender, scented geranium, and verbena. The roses must be picked from the trees and be quite dry, and the petals must be separated and dried in the sun on sheets of newspaper. Then they must be mixed with the spices. This quantity is enough to fill one large bowl or two or three small ones. Russian Toffee.—I cupful each of sugar, golden syrup, and cream or milk, 2 oz. butter, 2 oz. grated unsweetened chocolate.. Put these ingredients into an enamelled saucepan and boil them together, stirring constantly for forty minutes. Then remove from the fire, and beat well until beginning to cool. Flavour with vanilla, and pour out on to a buttered dish to get cold. How to Clean Brass Trays.—-Wash with soap and water,, dry well, then rub the tray thoroughly with a lemon cut in half. Swill with cold water to remove all the lemon juice, polish with a. leather. Do not use any powder. How to Clean Silver.—The secret of keeping silver always, beautifully polished lies in the washing of it quite as much as in the polishing. It must be washed in hot water with ordinary yellow soap, and it must be dried at once. If all the silver is. washed first and dried afterwards, the silver will look smeared and dull, so it is best to wash a little and dry a little till all is done.ODDS AND ENDS. >58 After this it should be just rubbed up with a leather. The wash- leather must be kept clean by being washed frequently. A black leather will not polish. Once a week the silver should be thoroughly cleaned. A very little of Goddard’s plate powder mixed with methylated spirit may then be used, but it must be well rubbed off the silver with one leather and polished with a clean one. If these directions are followed the silver will always look well kept. No soda must be used in the water that silver is washed in, and it is better to keep a special cloth or sponge for washing the silver. 'The least particle of soda in the water or on the sponge will effectually spoil the polish. How to Clean Mirrors and Windows.—These are best cleaned with a pad of soft newspaper and a little methylated spirit and no water at all, and afterwards polished with a leather. How to Clean Water-bottles.—Tear up small some bits of newspaper and put in the bottles with some water, shake well, and the glass will look quite bright. Sloe Gin.—3 quarts of sloes, 1 gallon gin, 3! lbs. sugar-candy, 3 oz. bitter almonds. Put them all into a two-gallon jar and prick the sloes. Shake well two or three times a week. Keep well corked. At the end of two months strain and bottle it. The sugar-candy must be dissolved in some gin over a fire till it becomes a syrup. Sloe Gin (a simpler way).—Prick the sloes and fill the bottle with them, leaving room for sugar in the proportion of three quarters of a pound of lump sugar to a quart bottle of sloe gin. Pour over them gin sufficient to quite fill the bottles. Cork very tightly, and leave for a year. Then pour off the liquor, which s ready to use. It should be a bright red colour. Salad Dressing.—3 tablespoons salad oil, 1 dessert-spoon Tarragon vinegar, 1 salt-spoon salt, ^ salt-spoon pepper. Mix together, and toss the salad in it lightly till every leaf is coated with the mixture. Savoury Custard for Soup.—2 eggs, 1 gill stock. Put theODDS AND ENDS. 159 yolks of two eggs and the white of one well beaten into a buttered jar, add the stock and whisk together. Cover the jar with a sheet of buttered paper, and set it in a saucepan of boiling water about three inches deep ; the water must not come up to the top of the jar. Steam the custard very gently till it is set, which should be in about a quarter of an hour. Let it get cold, and then turn it out and cut it into thin slices, and shape into diamonds or circles, add them to the soup at the last moment. Sutherland Pudding.—-The weight of three eggs in flour, butter, and sugar. Beat the eggs well, then add the castor sugar and flour, and last the butter just warmed, flavour with vanilla or anything else you like, beat the mixture thoroughly with a silver fork, and just at the last add a little carbonate of soda, about as much as will cover a threepenny piece. Beat it once more, and then fill some buttered tins with the mixture, and bake at once in a hot oven. When cold scoop out some of the inside, fill with jam, and put on the top whipped cream sweetened and flavoured. Timbale.—| lb. macaroni, boil until soft, drain in a cloth, cut in pieces \ inch long; well butter a plain mould, place in it the macaroni endways, so as to give the appearance of honeycomb when turned out. Make a paste thus :—put a gill of water, a small piece of butter, and a little salt into a stew-pan to boil; when boiling throw into it a tablespoon of flour, leave it a few minutes, then stir in x egg; turn it on a plate till wanted. Take 1 lb. veal cutlet, remove the skin and bone, pound it in a mortar, and add to it half the quantity of the above paste and a quarter of the quantity of butter, with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Mix all together, add 1 whole egg and 3 yolks, pass it through a wire sieve, stir in a gill of white stock or milk, pour it into the mould, and steam for half an hour. Toast and Water.—Toast slowly and thoroughly a slice of stale bread till it is a light brown all over, but not burnt. Pour over it some boiling water, and let it stand covered till cold. If liked it may be flavoured with lemon rind, but it is generally made plain.i6o ODDS AND FINDS. Bread-crumbs for Game.— Rub some stale bread through a wire sieve. Butter a tin or strong plate very thoroughly, make it hot in the oven, and then sprinkle as many bread-crumbs as you want over it. Put the plate back in the oven for a few moments till the bread-crumbs are sufficiently coloured. They can then be scraped off the plate with a knife, and will be very- crisp and quite free from grease. Pease Pudding.—Soak some dried peas for a day and night, tie them loosely in a cloth, put them in cold water in a saucepan, and boil two or three hours. Rub them through a sieve, mix some butter with them, some pepper and salt, and a well-beaten egg. Tie the pudding tightly in a well-floured cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil quickly for an hour. Tomato Savoury.—Some raw tomatoes, i hard-boiled egg, i teaspoonful capers or pickled walnuts, a little cayenne, i tea- spoonful of butter. Take some rounds of fried bread, lay a slice of tomato on each round. Take out the yolk of the egg and cut the white in rings, mix the yolk with the capers, cayenne, and butter, and pound in a mortar. Fill the white rings with this mixture and serve cold.INDEX.

DAINTY, NOURISHING. “ PAROL A is immeasurably superior to arrowroot, cornflour, sago, etc. With milk it forms exquisite puddings, and in the nursery it will prove a valuable variety which children will take with avidity.” Liverpool Medico- Chiritrgical Journal. “An ideal form of giving farinaceous food with milk.”—A London Physician. Awarded Gold Medals at the two important International Exhibitions hold in 1860—Edinburgh and Liverpool—two yearn before any imitations were in the market. FAROl A is a highly refined preparation of Wheat, which conserves all the nutritive elements and fine flavour naturally belonging to the purest part of the grain. All irritating and indigestible matter has been removed by careful treatment, mechanical means only being employed. FAROLA will satisfy a robust appetite, but it is specially suited for invalids and children.

Invested Funds Exceed £550,000 Sterling. WHEN SHOULD A NURSE COMMENCE TO PROVIDE FOR OLD AGE? At once! Because the premium is lowest, and she can assure most for the money; because the saving is easy now; because it will set the mind at ease; because she will uever afford it better; if she is not provident on a small incomo, she will not be on a larger one! Not to-morrow, or next birthday, but now ! No saving is effected by a Nurse waiting until just before her birthday to join, as the sooner the payments commence the sooner they cease. A proper provision for old age is not a matter which it is sufficient merely to think about, hut a duty which demands to be done. A dirty which every woman owes to herself. WHY SHOULD A NURSE INSURE? To provide against that rainy day which must sooner or later come. To make sure that m the struggle for existence she will be able to obtain the needed rest and peace when she can work no longer. Why? Because it is an advantageous investment; because it is an easy mode of saving; because it is a moral obligation; because the Royal National Pension Fund possesses advantages superior to those of any other provident institution, and is regulated on the soundest actuarial principles.

18 FISH. Fish when in Season.—Turbot and brill are always good. Cod is good all the winter from September to the end of March. Eels are good all the year except April, May, June, and July. Haddock is always good, except, perhaps, in the spring, when it is less good. Herrings are best in the autumn and winter. Mackerel should not be eaten from November to the end of March. Mullet are only good from the beginning of April to the end of September. Smelts are only good from November to end of May. Soles are always good, except in the early spring. Salmon is good from February to end of September. Whiting are good from June to end of April. Crabs must not be eaten in January, February, and March ; lobsters the same. Oysters are good in all the months that have an “ r” in them. Fish, and how to Choose it.—The eyes must be bright, the gills a clear fine red, the body stiff, and, though firm, yet elastic to the touch. The fish must not have a disagreeable smell. A good turbot is thick and fleshy. If the under side has a bluish tint it is not good; the colour of it should be a pale cream. Soles can be chosen by the same signs as turbot. Salmon and codfish are best when the head is small, the shoulders thick, and the scales of a salmon must glisten and be very bright. If mackerel are not fresh the bright green of their backs becomes a coppery colour, and they are then very unwholesome food. Prawns and shrimps should feel very stiff and crisp when they are freshly boiled, and the tails turned inwards ; when these relax and the fish is soft they are stale. Hen lobsters are best for soups and sauces on account of the coral, but the flesh of the male is best for eating. Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when they are opened : it the shells are apart ever so little they are losing their condition, and when they remain far open the fish are dead, and oniy fit to be thrown away. Small natives are the best.

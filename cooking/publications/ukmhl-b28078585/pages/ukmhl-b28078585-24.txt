4 HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. Children, again, are hard to feed. They are very dainty, and though this trait must on no account be encouraged, the difficulty can be almost entirely avoided by care on the part of the house- keeper. They require very little meat; that meat should not be twice cooked; and greasy things must be scrupulously avoided. Soup is good for them, but they will not eat it if it is highly seasoned. Everything must be very plain, but very good, for children. Milk puddings are made more palatable to them if a fruit sauce is served with the pudding in a separate tureen, and it is also very good for them. Fruit sauce can be made from jam if no syrup is handy. There is a great art in good housekeeping. Nourishment is, ot course, the primary object of food, and must lie at the root of all your endeavours, but there is much to be learnt by the inexperienced in the proper combination of food. Variety is not essential to nourishment, but it is very expedient, and if it were not wanted there would be no need of any cookery books. In composing a menu you must consider the whole as well as the details, choosing for the various courses those things that go best together. There is not space to go thoroughly into this question here, and I can only give the broadest and most elementary rules. These are not to let two white courses follow each other ; that is, if you have white soup let the fish be fried. Do not have boiled meat and boiled fish, or boiled meat and a boiled pudding. If you have pastry in the meat courses avoid it in the sweets. If you have a rich kind of meat, let it be followed by a fruit sweet in some form or other. The taste of things is improved by the dishes that precede and follow them. Harmony must be, in fact, observed in the composition of a menu, though the effect may be heightened and improved by the introduction of some discords in the shape of very indigestible but very delicious compounds.

66 POULTRY. hind legs forward and the fore-legs back, and put a skewer down the mouth and one in each ear to keep the head in position. Put slices of fat bacon over its back to keep it moist, and baste with cream or milk till it is nearly cooked, then dredge with flour and baste well with butter. It will take from an hour and a half to two hours to cook, according to its size. For the gravy pour off the fat, and pour into the dripping-pan some good brown gravy, thicken, boil, and serve in a tureen. Red currant jelly must be served with hare. Larks Broiled.—Pick and clean the larks, cut off their heads and legs, truss them firmly, rub them over with beaten egg, and strew bread-crumbs over them. Broil them over a clear fire, and serve them on fried toast. They take about ten minutes to broil. Larks Roasted.—Place the larks in a tin in the oven, dredge with flour and baste them with butter. When they have been cooking about ten minutes put a piece of toast under them. Partridges.—Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside and out. Roast before a bright fire or in a brisk oven, basting well with butter. A little flour must be dredged on the breasts before they are quite done. They will take from twenty-five to thirty-five minutes. A piece of toast should be put under the birds a few minutes before they are ready. They should be served at once when they are cooked. Bread sauce, gravy, and fried bread-crumbs must be served with them, and they should be laid on the toast on the dish. Pheasants.—Let the birds hang as long as possible and pro- ceed as for partridges. Allow from three quarters of an hour to an hour to cook them. Pigeons.—Tame pigeons taste better if cooked as soon as possible after they are killed. Wild pigeons should hang a few days before they are eaten. Pigeon Pie.—3 pigeons, I lb. beefsteak, 3 hard-boiled eggs, a few slices of cooked ham or bacon cut in strips. Cut the pigeons into four pieces and the beefsteak into very small strips.

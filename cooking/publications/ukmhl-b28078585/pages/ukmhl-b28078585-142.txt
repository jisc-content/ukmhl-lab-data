SWEETS. 122 dish in which it is to be served, make a small hole in the centre, and pour in over the cake the wine, brandy, and lemon juice sufficient to soak it thoroughly. Blanch the almonds, cut them into spikes, stick all over the cake, and pour round it the custard (page 85). Trifle.—According to the size of the dish you require take small sponge cakes ; about six is a good number. Cut them lengthways and spread them with jam ; raspberry is the best. Put them together again and arrange in a dish, first three at the bottom, then two more, and on the top one, so that they form a small pile. Prick and pour over them as much sherry or mar- sala as they will soak up. Make a rich thick custard and pour over the cakes, and last of all cover with a high whip of rich cream, slightly sweetened. A few ratafias can be used as well as the sponge cakes, and are a great improvement, and these must also be soaked with wine. Vanilla Cream.—3 pint milk, 3 pint cream, 1 oz. gelatine, 2 oz. sugar, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavouring. Mix the yolks of three eggs and the whites of two with half pint milk, put in a jug, and place in a saucepan of boiling water; stir till it thickens, then stand on one side to cool. Put one ounce gelatine in half gill of water on the fire to melt. Take half pint cream in another basin with the castor sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla; whip into a stiff froth. Strain the gelatine into the custard, add the whipped cream, and pour into a mould previously dipped in cold water. Velvet Cream.—3 oz. gelatine, i pint sherry, 3 pint castor sugar, rind and juice of 1 lemon, 1 pint of cream. Put the gela- tine, sherry, sugar, and lemon into a basin in the oven. As soon as dissolved take it out and leave till nearly cold, then mix in the cream. Dip a china mould in cold water and pour in the mixture. When cold turn out. Victoria Pudding.—I egg, its weight in flour, ground rice, butter and sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, a little grated lemon

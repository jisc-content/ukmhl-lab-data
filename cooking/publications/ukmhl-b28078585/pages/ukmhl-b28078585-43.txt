23 KISH. To Bake Fresh Haddock.— For this dish it is best to have rather a large fish. First make some forcemeat. Take equal quantities of chopped suet and bread-crumbs (3 or 4 oz. accord- ing to the size of the fish), one teaspoon of grated lemon rind and one teaspoon of chopped parsley and thyme; add salt and pepper or cayenne. Bind these together with the unbeaten yolk of an egg, and if necessary a little milk. Clean and thoroughly dry the fish, fill it with the forcemeat, make three incisions with a sharp knife right across the back. Roll the fish so that its tail touches its head, and put it into a round pie-dish. Dredge with flour and put from 1^ to 2 oz. of butter, cut up into pieces, over it, and the juice of half a lemon. Bake in the oven from half to three quarters of an hour, or an hour if the fish is very large. Baste frequently. Serve in the pie-dish and pin round it a napkin. This is quite the nicest way of cooking a fresh haddock. To Boil Haddock.—Scrape, clean, and wash thoroughly. Lay the haddock in a fish-kettle with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and 4 oz. of salt to a gallon of water. If the -fish are small fasten the tails to their mouths. They will take from half to a quarter of an hour to cook. Serve with melted butter. To Fry Haddock.—Wash the fish and split down the middle and take out the backbone, sprinkle with flour and dry thoroughly in a cloth. Have ready about an ounce of butter melted in a frying-pan. Put the fish in the frying-pan, the white side near the fire first; when that is fried turn the fish and fry the other side. Sprinkle on it a little chopped parsley and some pepper and salt. Fry till it looks brown, and then serve very hot. To Fry Fresh Herrings.—Clean and scale the herrings; sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper, dredge with flour and brush over with beaten egg, and cover with coarse oatmeal. Fry in a little hot fat and drain well before serving. Another way is

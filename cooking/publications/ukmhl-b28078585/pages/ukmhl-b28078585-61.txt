41 MI*: AT. To Hash Meat.—Put into a saucepan one or two sliced onions and fry in a little butter. Then add half a pint of stock and flavour with pepper, salt, and mushroom ketchup. Thicken with a teaspoon or more of flour. If there is no stock, make some with the bones and trimmings of the meat, f of a pint of water, and i a teaspoon of Lemco. Then lay in the cold meat cut into neat thin slices, and warm through. If it boils the meat is spoilt. Put the meat into a hot dish and pour the gravy over Garnish with pickled walnuts and sippets of toast. It makes a variety to boil some macaroni separately and put a border of that round the hash. To Boil a Ham.—Well soak the ham in a large quantity of cold water for twelve hours, and change the water twice, then scrape it clean, put it into a large stew-pan with more than sufficient cold water to cover it, put in a blade of mace, a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf. Boil it four or five hours, and when done let it get cold in the liquor in which it was boiled. * Then remove the rind and shake browned bread-crumbs over it. To Cure Hams (very good).—Sufficient ingredients for two hams, about 16 lbs. each in weight : if lbs. of bay salt, if lbs. treacle, 5 oz. saltpetre, 3 oz. white pepper. Baste with the liquor once every day. Rub the hams with the dry ingredients thoroughly well the first day : the next day add the treacle and baste with the liquor ; leave one month in pickle, never omitting the basting once a day. When taken out of the pickle and drained, brush them all over with “ Smith’s Cambrian Essence,” and hang up in a dry place. The hams should be kept at least a year before they are used. They can be used sooner, but are not so good as when the)' are riper. Hot Pot.—2 lbs. beefsteak, or best end of neck of mutton, or two small rabbits, potatoes. For this a covered pie-dish or jar, that can be sent to table, is needed. Cut up the rabbit into joints and the meat into small pieces, flavour highly with pepper

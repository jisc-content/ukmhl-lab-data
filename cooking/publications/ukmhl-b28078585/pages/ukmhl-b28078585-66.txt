MEAT. 46 neck of mutton, but is in every other respect like the preceding recipe. To Roast a Leg of Mutton.—Time, 20 minutes to the pound. A leg of mutton is better for roasting after it has been hung as long as the weather will allow. It must be wiped very dry and dusted with flour and pepper. Cut off the knuckle, and trim off the piece of flank. Roast in the ordinary way according to the directions already given for roasting or baking meat. To Roast Loin of Mutton.—Cut off some of the fat and dredge with flour and pepper. Roast in the usual way. Serve red currant jelly with it. Loin of Mutton.—If a loin of mutton is carved like a saddle of mutton, the part from where the slices have been cut can be filled with mashed potatoes, and re-warmed for luncheon in the patent baking tin. Loin of Mutton boned and stuffed.—Skin and bone it. Make a good forcemeat, the same as veal stuffing. Lay it out flat and season with pepper and salt and the forcemeat. Roll the loin into a tight compact shape and bind with tape. Roast in the usual way. Serve red currant jelly in a separate dish. Mince (1).—Fry an onion in a little piece of butter in a sauce- pan, take out the onion and add about a quarter of a pint of good stock, flavour with Harvey sauce, pepper and salt, and add a very little flour to thicken it. Lay in the meat minced very finely with a knife, not in a machine, and warm through. Serve with sippets of toast round, and if liked, poached eggs on the mince. Mince (2) (another way).—Chop the meat finely. Put it in a saucepan with a very little gravy, only just enough to moisten the meat, a little ketchup and pepper and salt. Just make hot and serve. Everything depends on the flavouring. A little grated lemon rind is an improvement to mince made of white meat. Mince Moulds.—6 oz. cooked beef or mutton, 2 oz. ham, 1 teaspoon minced parsley, 4 oz. bread-crumbs, 2 eggs, 1 oz. butter, pepper and salt. Free the meat from skin and gristle, and

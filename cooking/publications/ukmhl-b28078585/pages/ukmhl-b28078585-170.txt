Then take one third of a French roll, well browned in the oven, and put it into the bever- age quite hot and cover it over. Cocoa Nibs.—These are more digestible than ordinary cocoa. The only secret in the success of making good cocoa from them is to stew them a great many hours, and make it the day before it is wanted, so that the fat can be skimmed off the cocoa when it is cold. Three ounces of cocoa nibs to a quart of water are good proportions. Put the nibs in an earthenware stew-pot and add the water cold ; let it boil, and then keep simmering all day. Set aside at night, and skim and boil up when wanted.

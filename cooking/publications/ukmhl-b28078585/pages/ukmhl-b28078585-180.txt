i6o ODDS AND FINDS. Bread-crumbs for Game.— Rub some stale bread through a wire sieve. Butter a tin or strong plate very thoroughly, make it hot in the oven, and then sprinkle as many bread-crumbs as you want over it. Put the plate back in the oven for a few moments till the bread-crumbs are sufficiently coloured. They can then be scraped off the plate with a knife, and will be very- crisp and quite free from grease. Pease Pudding.—Soak some dried peas for a day and night, tie them loosely in a cloth, put them in cold water in a saucepan, and boil two or three hours. Rub them through a sieve, mix some butter with them, some pepper and salt, and a well-beaten egg. Tie the pudding tightly in a well-floured cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and boil quickly for an hour.

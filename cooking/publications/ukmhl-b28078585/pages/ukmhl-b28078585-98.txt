To Boil Parsnips.—Wash and scrape the parsnips, cut them into quarters, and throw into boiling water salted and skimmed. They will take from half an hour to an hour, and can be served whole or mashed. To Boil Green Peas.—Shell the peas, but do not leave them too long before using them. Put them in plenty of boiling water with some salt, and one or two sprigs of mint. They will take from fifteen to twenty minutes to boil, according to the age o( the peas. Pour off the water, and drain the peas well. Put a piece of butter in the saucepan, and a little salt, and shake the saucepan over the fire to coat the peas with the butter. Serve in a very hot dish. To Boil Potatoes.—Wash the potatoes well, choose those that are about the same size, using big ones for one day and small ones another, or some will be better cooked than the others. Peel the potatoes and throw them into cold water, and then put them into a saucepan with enough cold water to cover them, and a little salt. Let them boil as slowly as possible, and if they are boiling too fast throw in a little cold water to check them. They will take from twenty to thirty minutes to cook after the water boils. A fork should be stuck in to make sure the potatoes are done. Throw away the water, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt, and leave them at the side of the fire with a cloth over the saucepan, and the lid half off. Let them remain so for about ten minutes, and give the saucepan a shake occasionally. To Steam Potatoes.—Wash some potatoes, peel them, and throw them into cold water. Put them into a strainer, fill the saucepan belonging to it with boiling water, put on the lid, and let the potatoes steam for about half an hour. Test them with a fork, sprinkle them with salt and serve quickly, or they will turn black.

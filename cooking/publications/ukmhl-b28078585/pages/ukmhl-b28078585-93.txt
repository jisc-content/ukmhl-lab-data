73 VEGETABLES. Vegetables.—All vegetables, except potatoes, Jerusalem arti- chokes, and dried peas and beans, should be put into plenty of fast-boiling water which has been salted and skimmed. New potatoes must also be put into boiling water. Greens, lettuces, etc., must be soaked in very strong salt and water to fetch out the insects. The lid must be kept off the pan in which green vege- tables are cooking that they may keep their colour, and the water kept fast boiling. A piece of crust tied in muslin and put in the pan will lessen the unpleasant smell given off when boiling. To Boil Globe Artichokes.—Soak the artichokes in strong salt and water, cut the stalks even, trim away the lower leaves, and cut a little piece off the ends of the others. Plunge the artichokes with the stalks uppermost into quickly boiling salted water. Leave the lid off the saucepan, and boil the artichokes until the leaves can be drawn out easily. They will take from half an hour to an hour, according their size and age. Oiled butter (page 87) or Dutch sauce (page 85) is to be served with them in a tureen. To Boil Jerusalem Artichokes.—Wash, brush, and pare the artichokes. Put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water, slightly salted, to cover them. Let the water boil, skim it well, and boil the artichokes till they are tender, which ought to be in twenty minutes after the water boils. The lid must be kept on the pan. Drain the artichokes, and serve with melted butter (page 87) over them. The artichokes will turn black if left in the pan after they are done. To Boil Asparagus.—Scrape very clean all the white part of the asparagus stalks and throw them into cold water. Tie them in bundles and cut the stalks even. Then put the bundles into a saucepan, with the points at the top, and fill it only three parts full with hot water a little salted, so that the tops of the asparagus are not touched by the water.

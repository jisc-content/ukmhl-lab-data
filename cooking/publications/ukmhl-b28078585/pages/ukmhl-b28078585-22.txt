2 HINTS ABOUT HOUSEKEEPING. is a liberal one for ordinary good plain living, and with a little skill a very good table can be kept on it; but for young married people, where the household is small, it is hardly sufficient unless economy dictates its necessity. It always costs much less in proportion to feed a number than a few. But taking as an example a household of six—a husband and wife, three servants, and usually one visitor—and a weekly allowance of ^3, the books will average as follows : £ s. d.

Tea and coffee are included in the grocer’s book. Butter and eggs are always troublesome items to control, as there is practically no limit to the amount that can be used in cooking.

Under this last heading are milk puddings, as the small amount of butter required is insignificant and is also not indispensable. Good cooking takes an immense amount of butter, but it is easier to regulate the use of it in soups and made-

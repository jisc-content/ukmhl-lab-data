THE CONFECTIONER. 63 each pound of pulp take half a pound of sugar, boiled to the blow; mix with the paste, and finish as for apple cheese. This, as well as all the pastes, may be evaporated to the required consistence by means of a water bath, which is done by placing the pan in which it is contained in another with water, which is kept boiling; this prevents the possibility of its being burnt, but it occupies more time. The kernels of the fruit may be blanched and added to it just before it is taken from the fire. Put it into moulds or hoops; dry them in the stove, first on one side and then on the other. All plums are done in the same manner. Quince Paste.—Proceed as for apple paste. Orange Paste,—Squeeze the juice from Seville or sweet oranges, and boil the peels in three or four waters to take off part of their bitterness. In the first put a little salt. When they are quite tender remove the white pith or pulp, and pound them quite fine in a mortar, with part of the juice, using sufficient to make them into a paste; then pass it and the re- maining portion of the juice through a sieve into a preserving pan; put it on the fire, and reduce to a marmalade; weigh it, and for each pound take three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar; clarify and boil to the blow; mix it with the paste, evaporate over a gentle fire to a good consistence, and finish as apple. The rinds of the oranges may be pared off before they are squeezed, which, if boiled in one water, will be sufficient, as the pith of the peel is ex- tremely bitter and indigestible, and the flavour or essential oil is contained only in the yellow porous part. Lemon Pa^^e.—Make as orange paste, using part of the juice and double the weight of sugar; or it may be made by using only the pounded peel with the same weight of sugar.

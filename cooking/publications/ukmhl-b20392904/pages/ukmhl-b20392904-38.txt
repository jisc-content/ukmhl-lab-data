Four pieces of iron, or small square bars, are usually employed to form a sort of bay, to prevent the sugar running off the stone, which is necessary in large casts. When the edges get set a little, remove the bars, and turn them, over into the centre. This is occasionally flavoured with lemons. When it is required, pour a few drops of the essential oil of lemons in the centre, before the edges are folded over, then cut it into narrow strips with a large pair of scissors or sheep-shears. When nearly cold, twist them, put them into glasses or tin boxes, and keep them closed to prevent the access of air.

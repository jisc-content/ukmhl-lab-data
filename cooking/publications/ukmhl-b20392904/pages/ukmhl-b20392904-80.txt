m THE CONFECTIONER* in the same manner, using only half the quantity of sugar. Gomme des Dattes. — One pound of dates, two pounds of very white picked gum Arabic, sugar two ounces. Make as jujubes. Gum of Violets,—Violet flowers one pound, picked gum two pounds, sugar four ounces in syrup. Pour three pints of water at the boiling point on the flowers in an earthen jar; stop it perfectly close, and keep it in a warm place for ten or twelve hours; strain the infusion by expression into a flat pan or dish, place it on an inclination, and let it rest for an hour that the faeces may subside; pour off the clear gently from the bottom or settling, and add to it six grains of turnsole bruised, and six grains of carmine, as this clear infusion is not sufficiently coloured to give it the beautiful tint of the violet. Mix in the powdered gum and sugar, stir it over a moderate fire until dissolved, pass it through a sieve, and finish in the bain-marie as jujubes. Any of these gums, when dry, may be crystal- lized. Almond Paste—Orgeat Paste. — One pound of sweet almonds, a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, two pounds of sugar. Blanch the almonds, and throw them into clean cold water as they are done, to preserve their whiteness; let them soak for a day, then dry them in a cloth, and pound them quite fine in a mortar, sprinkling them with orange^ flower water or lemon juice to prevent their oiling ; then with a spatula rub them through a fine wire sieve 3 what will not pass through, pound again until they are quite fine; clarify the sugar and boil it to the ball; mix the almonds with it, and stir it well over the fire with the spatula until it comes together ; then take it from the fire, and put it into an earthen pan

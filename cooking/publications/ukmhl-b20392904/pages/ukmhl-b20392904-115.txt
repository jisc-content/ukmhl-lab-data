THE CONFECTIONER. 103 pounded instead of being boiled, and mixed with the syrup, &c. The whole of these ices may be made with pre- served fruit instead of fresh. One pound of jam or jelly, one pint of water, the juice of two lemons, and syrup sufficient to make it palatable. Apple Water Ice. — Pare and core some fine apples, cut them in pieces into a preserving pan with sufficient water for them to float, boil until they are reduced to a marmalade, then strain: to a pint of apple-water add half a pint of syrup, the juice of a lemon, and a little water; when cold freeze. Pear Water Ice.—Prepare as apple ice. Orange Water Ice.—One pint of China orange- juice, one pint of syrup, half a pint of water, the juice of four large lemons. Rub off the yellow rind of four oranges and two lemons on sugar, scrap it off and mix with the strained juice syrup and water. Lemon Water Ice.—Half a pint of lemon juice, half a pint of water, one pint of syrup, the peels of four lemons rubbed off on sugar, or the yellow rind may be pared or grated off, and the juice squeezed to it in a basin; let it remain for an hour or two, then strain, mix, and freeze; whip up the whites of three eggs to a strong froth, with a little sugar, as for me- ringues ; when the ice is beginning to set, work this well in, which will make it eat beautifully soft and delicious; freeze to the required consistence; if the ice is to be served in glasses, the meringue may be added after it has been frozen. Orange-water ice may be done the same. Maraschino Water Ice.—Make a lemon ice as the above, using less water, and making up the deficiency with Maraschino; but be careful the taste of the lemon does not prevail too much; add more water

101 THE CONFECTIONER. The oil from nutmegs is often extracted from them by decoction, before they are brought to the market, and their orifices again closed with powdered sas- safras ; this may be ascertained by the lightness of the nut; if it is punctured with a pin, the oil wil be pressed from it when good. These oils may be ob- tained by expression or distillation; they hold resin in solution, and consequently sink in water. The essences usually sold are made by adding half an ounce of the pure oil to one pint of spirits of wine. Essence of Ginger,—The best Jamaica or China ginger two ounces, proof spirit one pint. Powder the ginger, mix it with the spirit, stop close, and let it steep for twelve or fourteen days. This is the same as is sold for " Oxley's concen- trated essence of Jamaica ginger"—a mere solution of ginger in rectified spirit.—Paris^s Pharmacologia. Essence of Peppermint.—" A spirituous solution of the essential oil, coloured green by spinach leaves." Ibid. This essential oil is obtained by distillation. Four pounds of dried leaves yield one ounce. Essence of Vanilla.—Vanilla two ounces, water ten ounces, rectified spirit three-quarters of an ounce. Cut the vanilla in small pieces, and pound it fine in a marble mortar, with loaf sugar (about a pound), adding the white of an egg and the spirit. Put it into a glazed pot, tie a piece of writing paper over it, and make a hole in it with a pin ; stand the pot in warm water, keeping it at that heat for twenty-four hours, then strain for use. One ounce of this is equal to a drachm of vanilla, and is excellent for flavouring ices, creams, liqueurs, &c. Essence of Bitter Almonds.—This is obtained by distilling the cake or residue of the almonds after the oil has been expressed from them. It is a deadly poison, containing prussic acid, like all other nuts oi leaves which possess the bitter principle. Flies drop

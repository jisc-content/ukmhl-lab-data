THE CONFECTIOVER. 133 and sugar. Sift the flour and mix it in lightly with the spatula, adding a little essence of lemon to flavour it. Fill the moulds and bake as before. When cakes are made in this way, the eggs should be quite fresh and good, otherwise the whites cannot be whipped up. When weak, pickled eggs are used. I find a good method is to beat the eggs first by themselves, over a fire, until they are warm ; then add the sugar, and whip it over the fire until it is again warm, or make as for hot mixtures, and heat it twice. Almond Savoy Cakes and Almond Hearts.— One pound of blanched sweet almonds (four ounces of them may be bitter), two pounds of sugar, one pint of the yolks of eggs, half a pint of whole eggs, one pound of flour, and the whites of twelve eggs beat to a firm froth. Pound the almonds with the sugar in a mortar, and sift them through a wire sieve, or grind them in a mill, and mix them with the sugar in the mortar. First mix the whole eggs well with the almonds and sugar, then add the yolks by degrees, stirring the whole until quite light; then mix in the whites, and afterwards the flour lightly ; prepare some moulds as for Savoy cakes ; but some only butter them. Fill the moulds three parts full and bake them in a moderate oven. For almond hearts, butter some tins in the shape of a heart, but without bottoms; cover a baking-plate with paper; place the tins on it, and fill them nearly three parts full with the mixture: dust a little sugar on the top, and bake them in a moderate oven. Venice Cake.—Take a Savoy cake and cut it in slices, half or three-quarters of an inch thick, in a parallel direction from the bottom to the top; spread over each slice with raspberry or apricot jam, or some of each alternately, or any other sort of preserve. Re- place each piece in its original form ; when completed^ make an icing as directed for cakes, with four whites

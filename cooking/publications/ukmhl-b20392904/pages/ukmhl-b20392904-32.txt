Particular attention should be paid to the heat of the stove, which must be kept regular and constant, and this can easily be ac- complished at a small expense with many of the patent stoves which are now in general use, and also without causing any dust. A Fahrenheit's or Reaumur's ther- mometer should be so placed that the heat may at all times be ascertained without opening the stove. This may be coloured with prepared cochineal, or other liquid colour, or by grinding any particular colour with the spirits of wine, and adding it to the syrup before it comes^to the feather. Fruits to Crystallize,â€”Have a square or round tin box, smaller at the bottom than the top, with wire gratings made to fit at convenient distances, and having a hole with a tube or pipe to admit a cork, and drain ofF the syrup. Take any of the preserved fruits wet (which see), drain from them the syrup, and dip them in luke-warm water to take ofF any syrup which may adhere to them; dry them in the stove; when dried, place them in layers on the gratings, side by side, so as not to touch each other; continue in this manner with any sort of fruit until the box is full; then fix the whole with a weight, to keep it steady. Boil a sufficiency of clarified sugar to fill the box to the de- gree of crystallization or the blow, add a little spirit of wine, and remove it from the fire. When a thin skin has formed on the top, remove it carefully with a skimmer, and pour the sugar into the mould; place it in the stove at 90 degrees of heat, and let it remain for twelve hours, then drain ofF the syrup into a pan from the tube at bottom, and let it remain in the stove

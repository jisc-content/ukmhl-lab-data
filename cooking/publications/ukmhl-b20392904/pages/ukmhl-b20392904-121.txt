THE CONFECTIONER 109 Stirring the sugar well from the bottom and sides of the pan with the whisk or spatula ; lay them off, and bake as dry meringues; these may be coloured by adding the liquid colour to the synip so as to give the desired lint; and either of them may be flavoured by rubbing off the peel of oranges, lemons, or cedrats on sugar, and scraping it off as it imbibes the oil; or it may be flavoured with vanilla, by cutting it in small pieces and pounding it with some sugar, or with any liqueur by adding a spoonful or two when you mix the eggs or sugar.

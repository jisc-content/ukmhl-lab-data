THE CONFECTIONER. 110 mixtures of meringue, and lay it off in rings, eitiiei round or oval, &c., to suit the size and form ot the dish on which it is to be served ; make four, five, or six rings, according to the height it is required; form them on clean tins buttered and dusted with sugar and fiour and bake them.

Some persons prefer making the points of light icing. Cups, vases, or other ornaments, are made by forming the body on a mould with almond paste, and when dried or baked, the surface is iced and the points placed on according to fancy, and ornamented with drops, piping, &c.; these are in general filled with cream when served; also a few wet fruits may be tastefully arranged on the top, or they may be filled with any sort of light fancy biscuit or pastry for variety.

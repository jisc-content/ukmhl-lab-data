THE CONFECTIONER. a pint of clarified syrup into the pan for each pound of almonds, and place it with the almonds on the fire ; boil to the ball, then take it off and stir the mixture well with a spatula that the sugar may grain and be- come almost a powder, whilst each almond has a coating. Put them into a coarse wire or cane sieve, and sift all the loose sugar from them, and also separate those which stick together. When cold, boil some more clarified syrup to the feather, put in the almonds, give them two or three boils in it, take them from the fire, and stir them with the spatula as before, until the sugar grains ; sift and separate them, and keep them in glasses or boxes.

Put some water with the sugar to dissolve it; when it is near boiling, add the almonds, and let them boil in it until it comes to the small ball; or when the almonds crack, take them from the fire, and stir them with a spatula until the sugar grains and becomes nearly a powder; put them into a sieve, and separate the lumps. Orange Prawlings.—Take four or five China oranges, and cut off the peel in quarters, or small lengths ; take off all the pith or white part of the peel, leaving only the yellow rinds, and cut in small pieces, about an inch long, and the size of pins. Have about a pint of clarified sugar boiling on the fire; when it romes to the blow, put in the pieces of peel, and let

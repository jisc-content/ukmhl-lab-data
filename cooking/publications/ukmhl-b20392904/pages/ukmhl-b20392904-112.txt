THE CONFECTIONER. 100 Tea Ice.—One quart of cream, two ounces of the best green tea, and twelve ounces of sugar; put the tea into a cup, and pour on it a little cold river water in which has been dissolved a small portion of car- bonate of soda, about as much as may be placed on a fourpenny piece; let it remain for an hour or two, then add a little boiling water, sufficient in the whole to make a very strong infusion ; or the boiling water may be dispensed with, adding more cold water in proportion, and letting it soak longer, when a superior infusion will be obtained; strain it, and add to the cream and eggs. Finish as the others. Vanilla Ice.—One quart of cream, half an ounce of vanilla, twelve ounces of sugar; cut the vanilla into small pieces, and pound it with the sugar until it is quite fine, add it to the cream and eggs, make it into a custard, strain, and when cold freeze, or it may be flavoured with the essence of vanilla. (See Es- sence.) Brown Bread Ice.—Make a quart of custard for ice, crumble a piece of brown bread quite fine, put it on a tin, and dry it just inside the mouth of the oven, or in a very hot stove; freeze the cream, and when the bread is cold work or stir it into it. Ratafia Cream.—For a quart of cream, as for brown bread, crumble six or eight ounces of ratafia cakes quite fine, and mix with the cream when it is frozen. Biscuit Cream,—Crumble some Savoy biscuits and a few ratafias, add the rind of two lemons rubbed on sugar, and mix in the cream when frozen. Noyau Cream Ice.—Make a custard cream, and flavour it with noyau; finish as almond ice. Maraschino Cream Ice.—Make as noyau, flavour- ing it with Maraschino de Zara. All liqueur ices are made the same way, using the difi^erent liqueurs with which each is named, or they may be made in this

THE GONFECTI0!^a, a rolling-pin made of the same material, or of iron. The stone must be fixed in such a manner that it may be heated from below with a pot of burning char- coal, or something similar. Warm the mortar and pestle by placing them on a stove, or by means of charcoal, until they are so hot that you can scarcely bear your hand against them. Wipe the mortar out clean, and put any convenient quantity of your prepared nuts in it, which you pound until they are reduced to an oily paste into which the pestle will sink by its own weight. If it is required sweet, add about one-half, or two-thirds of its weight of loaf sugar in powder; again pound it so as to mix it well together, then put it in a pan, and place it in the stove to keep warm. Take a portion of it and roll or grind it well on the slab with the roller (both being,previously heated like the mortar) until it is re- duced to a smooth impalpable paste, which will melt in the mouth like butter. When this is accomplished, put it in another pan, and keep it warm until the whole is similarly disposed of; then place it again on the stone, which must not be quite so warm as previously, work it over again, and divide it into pieces of two, four, eight, or sixteen ounces each, which you put in moulds. Give it a shake, and the chocolate will become flat. When cold it will easily turn out. The moulds for chocolate may either be made of tin or copper, and of different devices, such as men, animals, fish, culinary or other utensils, &c.; also some square ones for half-pound cakes, having divisions on the bottom which are relievoed. These cause the hol- low impressions on the cakes. The Bayonne or Spanish chocolate is in general the most esteemed. The reason of its superior quality is at- tributed by some to the hardness of the Pyreneean stone which they employ in making it, which does not absorb the oil from the nuts. Tbf.y do not use any pestle and

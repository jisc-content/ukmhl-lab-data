APPENDIXi 15S they wrap up the lump in chaff, and it may then be carried to any distant place without waste or melting." —Encyclopcedia Britannica. Saw-dust is used in England for wrapping up ice to be sent to a distance. To FILL THE IcE-HousE.—Cold and dry weather should be chosen; and if the ice is two or three inches thick, no opportunity should be lost in obtain- ing it. In a dry soil, where there is no drain or small well in the centre, the bottom should be covered with billets of small wood, brushwood, or bushes, in pre- ference to straw, to raise the ice from the bottom. Before filling, let the ice be well beaten, or broken small at the mouth of the well. While one person is throwing the broken ice into the well, another should be in the well to beat it down, that there may be as few cavities as possible. If snow is on the ground, it would be as well to mix some with the ice in filling, which will serve better than anything to fill up the vacancies, and render the whole solid and compact. Some recommend strewing the ice with salt, at intervals; but this, although it will cause the ice to freeze hard at first, will afterwards melt it. With a newly built ice-house, boards should be placed next the wall, and then straw, which must be used on all occasions. When the well is full, cover the top with straw. The passage leading to the well may also be filled with ice to be used at first. This should also be well covered with straw, and the outer door be made as air-tight as possible. Snow may likewise be preserved in a well. For this purpose it should be collected on a dry day, and in large balls. The well being lined with straw, these balls of snow are to be placed thickly together, and be well beaten, to render the whole a close compact mass. When the weather is very cold, it is difficult to get them together by beating, from their hardness; therefore a little water should be poured over them>

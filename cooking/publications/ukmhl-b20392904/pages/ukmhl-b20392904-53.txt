41 THE CONFECTIONER. Ihem out, etrew or dust over the surface with powder mixed with lawned sugar, and rub it over with the heel of your hand, which gives it a smooth face. This operation is termed " facing up." Brush this off, and again dust the surface with starch powder, cut them out, and place in wooden trays. Put them ii\. the stove to dry. Note,—All lozenges are finished in the same manner. Peppermint Lozenges, No, 2.—^These are made as No. 1, adding a little starch-powder or prepared plaster as for gum paste to the paste, instead of using all sugar. Peppermint Lozenges, Nos, 3 and 4.—Proceed in the same manner as for No. 2, using for each more starch powder in proportion. Use smaller cutters, and let the paste be rolled thicker. Transparent Mint Lozenges, No. 5.—These are made from loaf-sugar in coarse powder, the finest having been taken out by sifting it through a lawn sieve. Mix it into a paste with dissolved gum Arabic and a little lemon juice. Flavour with oil of peppermint. Finish as for No. 1. Superfine Transparent Mint Lozenges.—The sugar for these must be in coarser grains. Pass the sugar through a coarse hair sieve. Separate the finest by sifting it through a fine hair or lawn sieve. Mix and flavour as the others. Note.—The coarser the grains of sugar, the more transparent the lozenges. The finest particles of sugar being mixed with it, destroy their transparency. The solution of gum should be thicker in proportion as the sugar is coarse. Rose Lozenges.—Make your paste as No. 1, using the essential oil or otto of roses to flavour them; or the gum may be dissolved in rose water, and a little essential oil may be added to give additional flavour, if required. Colour the paste with carmine.

Put the pan on the fire again, and keep them con- stantly stirred, that the loose sugar may melt and burn about them of a fine brown. Either way will give them the burnt flavour, from which they take their name. Turn them out into a coarse sieve, sift all the loose sugar from them, and separate those that stick together. Boil the same quantity of clari- fied syrup as before to the feather, and colour it to the desired shade with prepared cochineal. Let it attain the same degree again before taking the syrup from the fire, then put in the almonds and stir them as before until the sugar grains, and again sift and separate them. The sugar for the third coating must not be boiled quite so high as the last, and there must be only suf- ficient to just cover them. Immediately the sugar begins to grain about them, turn them out on the stone, and cover them with the pan or a cloth. After a few moments separate them, and put them in boxes, or glasses, when cold.

BRANDY FRUITS. All fruits may be preserved with brandy; but onlj^ the best sort of plums, such as apricots, magnum bonums, peaches, greengages, mirabelles, &c., with cherries and pears, are those usually done. The fruit should be gathered before it is perfectly ripe, when it is prepared by blanching, &c., precisely the same as if it were intended for wet fruits; those preserved in this manner are often taken from their syrup and put in brandy; when the fruits are blanched put them for a day or two in a thin syrup, then take them out and arrange them in glasses; cover them with white brandy, into which you have mixed five ounces of powdered white sugar candy, and tie them over with bladder. Cherries are an exception to this rule. Take some fine Morello cherries, and cut off half the stalk; put them into brandy, and stop them close for a month; drain off the brandy, and to each quart add eight ounces of powdered loaf sugar or white sugar candy; dissolve and pour it over the cherries. Keep them well covered with spirit. SECTION XVI. ON BOTTLED FRUITS, OR FRUITS PRE- SERVED WITHOUT SUGAR.

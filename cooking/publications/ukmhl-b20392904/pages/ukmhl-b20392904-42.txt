Clove, Ginger, or Peppermint Rock.—These are all made in the same way as raspberry, using the essential oil of each for flavour. For clove, the mix- ture, whilst boiling, is coloured with cochineal ; ginger with saffron; but the peppermint must be kept per- fectly white, except the stripes, which is done by cut- ting off as many pieces from the bulk as you have colours, which should be in powder; put a sufficiency in each piece to give the desired tint, and keep them w^arm. When the remaining portion of the sugar is pulled, lay them over the surface in narrow stripes, double the roll together, and the face each way will be alike. Pull them out into long sticks, and twist them ; make them round by rolling them under the hand, or they may be cut into small pieces with a pair of shears or scissors, for pellets, pincushions, &c.

It may be made into a thick or thin sheet, and cut with a knife into small pieces, such as dice, diamonds, &c. The surface maybe strewed with currants, fillets of pista- chios, or coarse sugar, and cut into different forms wdtb tin cutters. It may also be formed into baskets, vases,

112 THE CONFECTIONER formed on cakes after they are iced, the execution of which depends on the ability and ingenuity of the artist. Baskets, Chinese, and other temples, &c., are form.ed on moulds by these means, first giving them a coating of white wax, which is brushed over them after it is melted, and when cold, the icing is formed on it like trellis-work; when finished, the mould is warmed, and the icing easily comes off. Some of the pipes which are used cannot be formed with paper as the tape and star-pipes, which are made of tin having a bag fastened to them in a similar manner to that generally used for dropping out Savoy biscuits, macaroons, &c., only much smaller, the point of the tin tube of the one being fluted to form a star, and in the other it is flat, so that when the icing is forced or squeezed through, it comes out in a broad thin sheet, like a piece of tape. I employ a set of pipes made of tin, with small bags fastened to them, which are made from the gut of the ox, now much used for tying over preserves instead of bladders, as it is much clearer and has no veins; these are of different dimensions; the orifice of the round ones commences at the size of a common pin, and the tape pipes from a q-uarter to half an inch in width. I find these much better than paper ones, as the trouble and time which is lost in constantly making new ones is amply repaid by the others, as they are not very expensive and are always ready for use. These pipes should be in the hands of the confectioner what the pencil or brush is to the painter, â€”capable of performing wonders with man of genius. Some of the bon-bons, which may be seen in the shops, are proofs of what I assert; and many things are so cleverly done, that many persons would believe that they were either formed in a mould or modelled. I have not space to enlarge further on this subject, but much more might be given in explanation; there-

In infancy and very early youth the form is very much alike in both sexes. The head is oval, very much extended backwards, with the forehead and top of the head comparatively flat; the jaw-bones are short and have little depth ; the bones of the nose are short and flat; in the male subject, the elevation of the frontal sinuses at the eyebrows, v»rhich characterizes the male head, is wanting; and the neck is very small in proportion to the head. In old age the cheeks and mouth fall in, because of the wasting of the teeth; the nose and chin approach each other ; the fat is absorbed, and the muscles shrink, which covers the surface with wrinkles; and in time, the bones too are wasted, and the figure bends beneath its own weight. With these divisions proceed to model the human figure, referring to anatomical plates for the position of the muscles, &c. When the figure is complete, proceed to dress it in any style or costume you may fancy, making it from the same paste, and colouring it, giving the figure any attitude you may think proper, but always prefer the graceful, avoiding the stiff and awkward. The modelling of animals and birds is on the same principle, the wings of the latter being pushed or cut in moulds or pasteboards. Flowers are mostly done with cutters in the form of the leaf of the flowers you would wish to represent; form the calyx in a mould, and fasten it on a piece of wire; fix the leaves on the calyx to imitate nature, and colour them accordingly. Modelling Tools.—No. 1 is termed the rose-stick, the thin flat end being used for forming the leaves of roses out of modelling wax by flattening a piece of it on a table until it is of the required form and size; the other end is used for fluting and making oorders.

160 ing to the fancy and approved taste of those who may make, or patronize them, the basis of all being similar, the principal difference being in the flavours given to them. They may be made with pistachio, filbert, coffee, ratafia, Curacoa, pine-apple, or other similar ices. A similar preparation to a cabinet puddingâ€”that is, a custard, made as directed page 97, to which add some crumbled stale savoy cake, with a few ratafias and macaroons. Flavour it with any kind of liqueur, wine, or brandy, and add some preserved fruit cut in dice, when frozen: makes a very excellent ice pudding. I have frequently made it for parties, and It has been invariable approved of. Ice puddings have lately been much introduced at fashionable tables under various names: to describe them, would be but a repetition of similar instructione to that just given, which will be sufficient to enable any person of ordinary tact to invent as many as he pleases, or he can find patrons for.

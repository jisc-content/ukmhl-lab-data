129 THE CONFECTIONER. Umber.—^This is of a blackish brown colour; it is an earth found near Cologne. Bistre.—^This is an excellent light brown colour prepared from wood soot. These browns are harmless, but sugar may be substituted for them to any shade required by con tinning the boiling after it has passed the degree of caramel until it is burnt, when it gives a black brown, but water may be mixed with it so as to lessen the shades. Dissolved chocolate may also be substituted in some cases for the brown colours. Black,—Blue black is powdered charcoal, or ivory black, which is obtained from the smoke of burnt ivory; but bone black is generally substituted instead ; either of these may be used, but are only required for painting gum paste, except in one or two cases, one of which is to colour the common sweetmeats known in London as black jack; for this blue black is used. Obtain any of these colours in fine powder, and mix them with some dissolved gum Arabic, a little water, and a pinch of powdered sugar candy; mix them to the required consistence for painting. For sugars they must be used in a liquid state, and be added before it has attained the proper degree; it may also be used in the same manner for ices, creams, &C.J and for icings it can be used either way.

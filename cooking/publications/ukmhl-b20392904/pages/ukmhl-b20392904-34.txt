THE CONFECTIONER. 22 inch asunder, and to suit the width of the bo«; these may be made either of lead, plaster, or wood, in the form of rings, diamonds, stars, bottles, scissors, harps, shoes, or any other form your fancy may suggest; make the impressions in the powder in regular rows, until the box is full; then prepare some sugar as for the preceding articles, boiling it to the blow, and fla- vouring it with any sort of spirit or liqueur, such as brandy, rum, noyau, Maraschino, cinnamon, rosolis, &c., colouring the syrup accordingly. It should be prepared in a pan with a lip to it. When a thin skin has formed on the top, place a cork in the lip of the pan, but not to close it, allowing a space for the sugar to run out, the cork being merely to keep back the skin ; then fill the impressions you made in the powder and place them in the stove at 90 degrees; let them remain a day, then take them out, and their surfaces will be found quite hard and solid; brush the powder from them with a light brush, when they may eithei be painted, crystallized, or piped. Many of these bon-bons are beautifully piped and coloured to repre- sent dogs, horses, costumes, and theatrical characters ; the fur on the robes is imitated with white or coloured sugar in coarse grains, and lace-work is done by means of a pin. Liqueur drops are made with the impression of half a ball to any required size, as other forms. If the flat parts of two are moistened, put together, and dried in the stove, they will form drops perfectly round. To form a Chain ixiith Liqueur Rings.—Have some moulds to form the impressions in powder, as in the preceding, in the shape of the links of a chain; fill them with syrup at the blow, as before, and put them in the stove for a day; when they are hard and fit to be taken out, place them on their ends in the Dowder; have another mould of a link in two halves,

THE CONFECTIONER CANDY. Sugar, after it has passed the degree of the leather is of itself naturally inclined to grain, that is to candy, and will form a powder if agitated or stirred: for as the boiUng is continued, so is the water evaporated until there is nothing left, to hold it in solution: therefore that body being destroyed by heat, which first changed its original form Ito those we have already enumerated, as this no longer exists with it, it naturally returns to the same state as it was before the solvent was added, which is that of minute crystals or grains, being held together by the attraction of cohesion, unless, as before stated, they are separated by stirring. The water being evaporated by boiling from the last degree, leaves a thin crust of crystals round the sides of the pan, which shows it has attained the candy height; and this crust must be carefully removed, as it forms, with a damp cloth or sponge, or the whole mass will candy if suffered to remain. To prevent this is the chief desideratum,of allfurther proceedings for which specific rules will be given in their proper places. The remaining degrees can be ascertained after the following manner. The Ball.â€”Provide a jug of clean cold water, and the stem of a clean tobacco pipe or a piece of round stick. First dip it in the water, then in the sugar, and again in the water ;* take off the sugar which has adhered to it, and endeavour to roll it into a ball between the finger and thumb in the water: when this can be done, it has attained the desired degree. If it forms a Wge hard ball which will bite hard and adhere to the ^eth when eaten, it is then termed the large ball, ei contra. * This should be performed as speedily as possible.

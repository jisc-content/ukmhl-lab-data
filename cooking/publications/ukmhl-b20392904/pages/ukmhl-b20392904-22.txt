THE CONFECTIONER. 10 for, in boiling, the whole of the aroma bf the plant ii dispersed, and the syrup loses that delicate flavour for which it is prized. Aromatic herbs, and the leaves of plants in general, yield their virtues most perfectly when moderately dried. Cold water extracts from these in a few hours the lighter, more fragrant and agreeable parts, and then begins to take up the more ungrateful and grosser. By pouring the same liquor on fresh parcels-of the herb it becomes stronger, richer, thicker, and balsamic. Those only should be decocted whose principles consist of mucilage, gum, or resin, and require boiling to extract them. The compact resinous woods, roots and barks, yield their virtues most freely while fresh. Dry, they yield little to cold or moderately warm water, and require it to be boiling. By this process the grosser, more fixed saline and mucilaginous parts are dissolved, the resinous melted out, and the volatile dissipated. Infusions.—" These are watery solutions of vege- table matter, obtained by maceration, either in hot or cold water, with the assistance of ebullition. In select- ing and conducting the operation, the following general rules should be observed :— 1st. Infusion should always be preferred before decoction, where the virtues of the vegetable substance reside in volatile oil, or in principles which are easily soluble ; whereas, if they depend upon resino-mucilagin- ous particles, decoction is an indispensable operation. " 2nd. The temperature employed must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, and in- fusion made with cold is in general more grateful but less active than one made with heat. 3rd. The duration of the process must likewise be regulated by the nature of the substances ; for the in- fusion will differ according to the time in which the water has been digested on the materials : thus the

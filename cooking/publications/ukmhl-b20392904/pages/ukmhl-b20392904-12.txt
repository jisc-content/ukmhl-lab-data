When the business of the day is over he should avail himself of every opportunity that offers to practise sugar-spinning modelling, and gum-paste work, as it is by practice alone that proficiency in these is ac- quired. In the present day the various branches are so mixed and blended together that a man had need be a good general workman to insure adequate employment, for without this the chances of a situation are extremely small, as it is only in large and respectable establishments that men are employed for any particular branch, and these are mostly wholesale firms ; therefore I would advise all parents or guardians who wish to place lads out to learn the business to npprentice them at some good shop, where the business is carried on in a general way, and where they will have to work at each department. Masters are now very particular, and will not take improvers unless they have previously served their apprenticeship to the business.

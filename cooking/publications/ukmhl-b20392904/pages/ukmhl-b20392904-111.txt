Coffee Ice Cream.—One quart of cream, five ounces of Mocha coffee, and twelve ounces of sugar; roast the coffee in a coarse iron or other stew-pan, keeping it constantly stirred until it is a good brown colour; throw it into the custard cream whilst it is quite hot, and cover it closely; let it infuse for an hour or two, then strain and freeze. The cream may be made with an infusion of coffee, thus: take the quantity of coffee, fresh roasted and ground to a fine powder; put this into a common glass bottle or decanter, and pour on it sufficient cold river water to moisten the powder and make an in- fusion ; stop the bottle close, and let it remain all night; the next day filter the infusion by passing it through some fine lawn or blotting paper placed in a glass funnel; by this process a very strong and su- perior infusion is obtained, which contains the whole of the aroma of the coffee. Dr. Ratier observes,— " I have tried this process with boiling and with cold water; and I have assured myself, by comparison, that the powder drained by the cold water, and treated then with boiling water, gave nothing but a water slightly tinted with yellow, and devoid of odour and flavour. It is, besides, proper to pass an equal quantity of water to the first, over the grounds, in order that the second water may serve for new powder." Use this for flavouring the custard, and freeze. Chocolate Ice.—One quart of cream, six ounces of chocolate, and ten ounces of sugar; dissolve the cho- colate in a little water, or make the sugar into a syrup, to dissolve it by putting it on the side of the stove, or over the fire; add the cream and eggs, and make it into a custard as before ; when cold freeze.

On the Construction of Assiettes and Pieces Montees, —To be a proficient in this part requires a general knowledge of the fine arts, particularly the principles of architecture; for without this, however well your piece may be finished with regard to workmanship, it still remains a dull, heavy, unmeaning mass, having no proportion nor a particle of true design in it. I have seen many pieces, and some in the principal shops of London, with these defects, although other- wise well executed. My limits will not allow me to enter into the details necessary to illustrate this part, therefore the artist must refer to books on the subject; but in the absence of these it is best to work from some correct drawing, which, with the few notes I shall subjoin, may serve for general purposes. There are many prevailing styles or orders of architecture, as the Egyptian, Grecian, Roman, Saxon, Norman, Gothic, &c.

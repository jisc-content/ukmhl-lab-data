Half pint, pint, pint and a half, and quart moulds, and some in the form of fruits made to open in the centre with a hinge; these also require to be made of the same material. 3rd. Ice pails. These should be adapted to the size of the pots, about the same depth, and eight or ten inches more in diameter; if even greater, it is immaterial, the depth being the principal con- sideration, for the deeper it is the greater caution is required to prevent the salt from entering the mix- ture ; for as the ice dissolves, the pot descends, and the water runs under the cover, which, being salt, spoils the contents; neither have you a sufficient basis whereon the pot rests so as to mix your creams, &c., with the spatula; consequently, half your exertions are lost by its constant sinking when you apply the least effort to scrape it from the sides.

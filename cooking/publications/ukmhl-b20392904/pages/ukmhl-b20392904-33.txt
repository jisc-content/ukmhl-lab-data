When the syrup is drained off, if you find the size of the crystals is not large enough, another lot of syrup may be prepared and poured over it; let it remain in the stove for seven or eight hours, then drain and finish as before.

After the syrup is drained off, and the ar- ticles dried, they must remain until quite cold before being turned out, as the chocolate continues soft for some time. Liqueur Rings, Drops, and other Devices.—These are all made after the same manner. A square box is necessary, which you fill with very dry starch powder. Sugar, powdered very fine and dried, will answer the same purpose. The depth of the box should be suited to the articles intended to be made. Shake the box, or pass a knife repeatedly through the powder, that it may be solid ; smooth the surface with a straight piece of wood; have a thin piece of flat board, on which is fastened a number of little devices, about an

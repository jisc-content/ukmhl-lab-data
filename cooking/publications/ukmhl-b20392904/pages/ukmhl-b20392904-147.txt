135 THE CONFECTIONER. of powdered loaf-sugar, one pound two ounces of flour, twelve eggs, half a pound of citron, and lemon-peel. Mix as for pound-cake. If the mixture begins to curdle, which it is most likely to do from the quantity of eggs, add a little of the flour. When the eggs are all used, and it is light, stir in the remainder of the flour lightly. Bake it in long, narrow tins, either papered or buttered . first put in a layer of the mixture, and cover it with the peel cut in large thin slices; proceed in this way until it is three parts full, and bake it in a moderate oven. Rice Pound-cake.—One pound of butter, one pound of powdered loaf-sugar, twelve ounces of flour, half a pound of ground rice, and twelve eggs. Mix as Italian bread, and bake it in a papered hoop. If it is required with fruit, put two pounds of currants, three-quarters of a pound of peel, one nutmeg, grated, and a little pounded mace. Wafers,—Four ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, eight ounces of flour, the yolk or white of one egg, and half a tea-cupful of milk or water. Melt the butter in the water; mix the egg, sugar, and flower to- gether, adding, by degrees, the melted butter and water; or, instead of the butter, it may be made into a thin batter with cream, and a little orange-flour water, or any other essence, to flavour it. The mixture may be coloured. Make the wafer-tongs hot over the hole of a stove or clear fire. Rub the inside surfaces with butter or oil, put in a spoonful of the batter, and close the tongs immediately; put them on the fire, turning them occasionally until the wafer is done, which a little practice will soon enable you to ascertain ; roll the wafers on a small round stick, stand them on their ends in a sieve, and put them in the stove to dry; serve ihein with ices.

Papier Machee.—Take the cuttings of either white or brown paper, and boil them in water until re- duced to a paste; press the water from it when cold enough, and pound it well in a mortar; put it into a pan or glazed pipkin, with a little gum Arabic, Senegal, or common glue, made into rather a thick mucilage with water; this is to give it tenacity; place it on the fire and stir it until well incorporated; if it is not stiff enough when cold, flour may be added to make it of the proper consistence; it should be about the same substance as gum paste. This may be used for forming the rocks of a piece montee, or for vases, cassolettes, &c.; in fact, anything you de- sire may be made with it, as with gum paste; it is very durable, not being easily broken, and is very light; it is now much used, instead of eom- position, for the decorations of rooms and articles of furniture. It is from this that paper trays, snuff boxes, &c., are manufactured, and it is much used in France for making various beautiful little ornaments for containing bon-bons, &c It may be moulded or modelled into any form, or cut from impressions in wood or plaster, &c. When the object is dry, give it a coating of composition, made with parchment size, and whitening or lamp-black, mixed to the con- sistence of oil paint, according to the colour it is required. Smooth it with glass paperand paint or gild as wood, or japan it.* To gild Gum Paste, S^c.—Those articles which are gilt are seldom intended to be eaten, therefore first give them a coating of parchment size and whitening, * For further particulars, and for the method of taking the impressions of moulds with composition, see the ' Guide to Trade—The Carver and Gilder,' Knight and Co., p. 53.

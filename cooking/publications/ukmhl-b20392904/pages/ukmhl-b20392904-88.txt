76 THE CONFECTIONER. Orange or Lemon Peels^ wet.—Cut the fruit in half; express the juice, and throw the peels into salt and water, as for whole orange peels, preserving them in the same way. If you have any quantity, put them one in the other, and pack them in rows round the bottom of a large tub or cask; proceed in this manner, putting them in layers until it is half or three parts full; have a hole near the bottom, w4th a cork fitted into it.

The next day drain it off, without disturbing the angelica; boU with more sugar, if required, taking off any scum which may rise; pour it over the stalks whilst it is

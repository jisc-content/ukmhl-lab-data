The first sediment is Florence lake, which remove, and dry the carmine for use. Thia preparation is by far superior to the first, for in this the same colour is obtained as before, which is the liquid rouge, the other and more expensive parts being invariably thrown away. The carmine may be obtained by the first process, as can be seen if the whole is poured into a clear bottle and allowed to settle, when the carmine will b^ deposited in a layer of bright red near the bottom. It produces about half an ounce of carmine, which is worth from four to six shillings. F(f?//oi(;.—Infuse saffron in warm water, and use it for colouring anything that is eatable. The English hay-saffron is the best; it is taken from the tops of the pistils of the crocus flower; it is frequently adul- terated with the flowers of marygolds or safflower, which is known as the bastard saflron, and is pressed into thin cakes with oil. Good saffron has a strong agreeable odour, and an aromatic taste. Gum paste and other articles which are not eaten may be coloured with gamboge dissolved in warm water. Blue.—A beautiful colour may be obtained from indigo : it is seldom used in confectionary, as it always gives a dead muddy colour unless it is dis- solved ; the method of preparing it is considered a great secret by some, but it is well known to dyers. Chaptal, in his chemistry, explains the principle. " The blue colour is formed in dead vegetables only by fermentation. Now in these cases there is a fixation of oxygen. This oxygen combines with the feciila in indigo, with an extractive principle in turn- sole, &c.; and most colours are likewise susceptible of being turned into red by a greater quantity of oxygen. Thus it is that turnsole reddens by expo-

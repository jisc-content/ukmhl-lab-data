53 THE CONFECTIONER, the comfit-pan, and pour on them a little syrup, as for Scotch caraways, proceeding in the same way until they are one-third the required size. You must not use your hand for these as you would for caraways, as they are liable to break in two. Dry them in the stove, then suspend the pearling pot or cot from the bar of the pan or ceiling, so as to hang over the centre of the pan; boil some clarified loaf sugar to the large pearl, and fill the cot; put some of the prepared comfits in the pan, but not too many at a time, as it is difficult to get them to pearl alike. Keep tne syrup at the boiling point: open the spigot of the cot so as to allow it to run in a very small stream, or more like a continued dropping; swing the pan backwards and for- wards gently, and keep a stronger fire under the pan than otherwise. Be careful that the syrup does not run too fast, and wet them too much, but so that it dries as soon as dropped, which causes them to appear rough. If one cot full of sugar is not enough, put in more until they are the required size. When one lot is finished put them in sieves to dry, and proceed with another; but do not let them lie in the pan after you have finished shaking them. They will be whiter and better if partly pearled one day and finished the next. Use the best clarified sugar to finish them. Coriander Comfits.—Proceed with these as for Scotch caraways, working them up to about the same size. The next day pearl them to a good size, as for cinnamon. Celery Comfits.—Put one pouiiii of celery seed into the pan, and proceed as for Scotch caraway comfits, working them up to the size of a large pin's head. Dry and pearl them as cinnamon. Caraway Comfits, pearled,—When the comfits are about the size of Bath caraways, dry and pearl them as cinnamon. Almond Comfits.—Sift some Valencia almonds in a

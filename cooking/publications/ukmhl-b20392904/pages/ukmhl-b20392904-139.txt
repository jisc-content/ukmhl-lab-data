Hence it is that indigo does not become red by acids, but is on the contrary soluble in them. It is likewise for the same reason that we observe a red colour developed in vegetables in which an acid continually acts, as in the leaves ot the oxalis, of the virgin and ordinary vine, and the common sorrel. Hence also it happens that acids brighten most of the red colours, and that a very high charged metallic oxide is used as the mordant for scarlet." This extract demonstrates why it is that the carmine is directed to be prepared in a tinned vessel, and a solution of tin being used to precipi- tate it. Indigo is dissolved with oil of vitriol. One pound of this acid is requisite for a quarter of a pound of indigo; it should be pounded fine before it is added, and prepared in a vessel capable of containing double the quantity, or it will effervesce over. " Bergman mixed one part of indigo, well pulver- ized, with eight parts of colourless sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1 * 90. The glass bottle in which the mixture was made was slightly corked. The acid speedily attacked the indigo and excited a great heat. After twenty four hours the indigo was dissolved, but the mixture was opaque and black. On adding water it cleared up, exhibiting all the shades of blue, according to the quantity of water. " The fixed alkalies, saturated with carbonic acid, separate from the solution of indigo a very fine blue powder, which is very slowly deposited. Bergman distinguishes this blue by the name of precipitated indigo. It is also obtained by pouring drop by drop the alcoholic solution into saturated solution of alum, of sulphate of soda, or of some other salts which con- tain carbonic acid."

THE CONFECTIONER. 34 pith. Insert a small piece of stick or whisk in the end of each, dip them in caramel, and form them on the inside of an oiled mould. Cherries and grapes may be used either fresh, or preserved wet, and dried. Dip ^hem in caramel, and form them as oranges. Each of these, or any other fruit, after being dipped in ca ramel, may be laid on an oiled marble slab separately, and served on plates in a pyramid, with fancy papers, flowers, &c. The baskets are finished as Chantilly with spun sugar. Almond Baskets.—Blanch some fine Jordan al- monds, and cut them into thin slices, and colour them in a small copper pan over the fire with prepared liquid colour (see Colours). Put them into the pan, and pour in colour sufficient to give the desired tint; rub them about in the pan with your hand until they are quite dry: form them as for a Chantilly basket, and spin sugar over them, or else form them on an oiled marble slab, and spin sugar over them on each side. Afterwards arrange them in a mould, or build them to any design, first having a pattern cut out in paper, and form them on the stone from it. Rock Sugar,—Boil a quart of clarified syrup to the crack. Have some icing previously prepared as for cakes, or mix some fine powdered loaf sugar with the white of an egg to a thick consistency as for icing; ) take the sugar from the fire, and as soon as the boiling has gone down stir in a spoonful of this or the icing, which must be done very quickly, without stopping, Let it rise once and fall; the second time it rises, pour it out in a mould or paper case, and cover it with the pan to prevent its falling. Some persons pour it out the first time it rises, and immediately cover it as before. It may be made good both ways. If it is required coloured, add the colouring to the syrup whiist it is boiling, or with the icing, adding more sugar to give it the same stiffness as before.
